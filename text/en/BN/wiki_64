<text>Bob Dylan is the debut studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on March 19, 1962, by Columbia Records. The album was produced by Columbia talent scout John H. Hammond, who had earlier signed Dylan to the label, a controversial decision at the time. The album primarily features folk standards but also includes two original compositions, &quot;Talkin&#x27; New York&quot; and &quot;Song to Woody&quot;. The latter was an ode to Woody Guthrie, a significant influence in Dylan&#x27;s early career.

The album did not receive much attention at first, but it achieved some popularity following the growth of Dylan&#x27;s career, charting in the UK three years after its release, reaching No. 13.

== Recording ==
Dylan met John Hammond at a rehearsal session for Carolyn Hester on September 14, 1961, at the apartment shared by Hester and her then-husband, Richard Fariña. Hester had invited Dylan to the session as a harmonica player, and Hammond approved him as a session player after hearing him rehearse, with recommendations from his son, musician John P. Hammond, and from Liam Clancy.

Hammond later told Robert Shelton that he decided to sign Dylan &quot;on the spot&quot; and invited him to the Columbia offices for a more formal audition recording. No record of that recording has turned up in Columbia&#x27;s files, but Hammond, Dylan, and Columbia&#x27;s A&amp;R director Mitch Miller have all confirmed that an audition occurred.

On September 26, Dylan began a two-week run at Gerde&#x27;s Folk City, second on the bill to The Greenbriar Boys. On September 29, an exceptionally favorable review of Dylan&#x27;s performance appeared in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, written by Robert Shelton. The same day, Dylan played harmonica at Hester&#x27;s recording session at Columbia&#x27;s Manhattan studio. After the session, Hammond brought Dylan to his offices and presented him with Columbia&#x27;s standard five-year contract for previously unrecorded artists, and Dylan signed immediately.

That night at Gerdes, Dylan told Shelton about Hammond&#x27;s offer but asked him to &quot;keep it quiet&quot; until the contract&#x27;s final approval had worked through the Columbia hierarchy. The label&#x27;s official approvals came quickly.

Studio time was scheduled for late November. During the weeks leading up to those sessions, Dylan began searching for new material even though he was already familiar with many songs. According to Dylan&#x27;s friend Carla Rotolo (sister of his girlfriend Suze Rotolo), &quot;He spent most of his time listening to my records, days and nights. He studied the Folkways &quot;Anthology of American Folk Music&quot;, the singing of Ewan MacColl and A. L. Lloyd, Rabbit Brown&#x27;s guitar, Guthrie, of course, and blues … his record was in the planning stages. We were all concerned about what songs Dylan was going to do. I remember clearly talking about it.&quot;

The album was ultimately recorded in three short afternoon sessions on November 20 and 22 at Columbia&#x27;s 7th Avenue studio. Hammond later joked that Columbia spent &quot;about $402&quot; to record it, and the figure has entered the Dylan legend as its actual cost. Despite the low cost and short amount of time, Dylan was still difficult to record, according to Hammond. &quot;Bobby popped every &quot;p&quot;, hissed every &quot;s&quot;, and habitually wandered off mike,&quot; recalls Hammond. &quot;Even more frustrating, he refused to learn from his mistakes. It occurred to me at the time that I&#x27;d never worked with anyone so undisciplined before.&quot;

Seventeen songs were recorded, and five of the album&#x27;s chosen tracks were actually cut in single takes (&quot;Baby, Let Me Follow You Down&quot;, &quot;In My Time of Dyin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Gospel Plow&quot;, &quot;Highway 51 Blues&quot;, and &quot;Freight Train Blues&quot;) while the master take of &quot;Song to Woody&quot; was recorded after one false start. The album&#x27;s four outtakes were also cut in single takes. During the sessions, Dylan refused requests to do second takes. &quot;I said no. I can&#x27;t see myself singing the same song twice in a row. That&#x27;s terrible.&quot;

The album cover features a reversed photo of Dylan holding his acoustic guitar. This was done to prevent the neck of the guitar from obscuring Columbia&#x27;s logo.

==Music==
By the time sessions were held for his debut album, Dylan was absorbing an enormous amount of folk material from sitting and listening to contemporaries performing in New York&#x27;s clubs and coffeehouses. Many of these individuals were also close friends who performed with Dylan, often inviting him to their apartments where they would introduce him to more folk songs. At the same time, Dylan was borrowing and listening to many folk, blues, and country records, many of which were hard to find at the time. Dylan claimed in the documentary &quot;No Direction Home&quot; that he needed to hear a song only once or twice to learn it.

The final album sequence of &quot;Bob Dylan&quot; features only two original compositions; the other eleven tracks are folk standards and traditional songs. Few of these were staples of his club/coffeehouse repertoire. Only two of the covers and both originals were in his club set in September 1961. Dylan stated in a 2000 interview that he was hesitant to reveal too much of himself at first.

Of the two original songs, &quot;Song to Woody&quot; is the better known. According to Clinton Heylin, the original handwritten manuscript to &quot;Song to Woody&quot; bears the following inscription at the bottom of the sheet: &quot;Written by Bob Dylan in Mills Bar on Bleecker Street in New York City on the 14th day of February, for Woody Guthrie.&quot; Melodically, the song is based on one of Guthrie&#x27;s own compositions, &quot;1913 Massacre&quot;, but it is possible Guthrie fashioned &quot;1913 Massacre&quot; from an even earlier melody; like many folk singers, including Dylan, Guthrie would often adapt familiar folk melodies into new compositions. Guthrie was Dylan&#x27;s main musical influence at the time of &quot;Bob Dylan&quot;″s release, and indeed on several of the songs, Dylan is apparently imitating Guthrie&#x27;s vocal mannerisms. &quot;Talkin&#x27; New York&quot; is closely based on Guthrie&#x27;s song &quot;Talking Dustbowl Blues&quot; and also references &quot;The Ballad of Pretty Boy Floyd&quot;.

Dylan takes an arranger&#x27;s credit on many of the traditional songs, but a number of them can be traced to his contemporaries. For example, the arrangement of &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; was developed by Dave Van Ronk, who was a close friend at the time. Van Ronk had intended to record this arrangement himself and was upset that Dylan had recorded it. During his recording of &quot;Baby Let Me Follow You Down&quot;, Dylan mentions the arranger, Eric Von Schmidt, whom he met in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Von Schmidt introduced the arrangement to Dylan as well as an arrangement for &quot;He Was a Friend of Mine&quot;, which was also recorded for but omitted from Dylan&#x27;s first album.

Dylan would leave most of these songs behind when he moved to the concert stage in 1962, but he performed &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; during his first national television appearance in mid-1963 (a performance included on the 2005 retrospective &quot;No Direction Home&quot;). &quot;Baby Let Me Follow You Down&quot; would later return in a driving electric arrangement during his 1965 and 1966 tours with the Hawks; a live recording was included on &quot;Live 1966&quot;.

After 1966, Dylan performed only five songs from his debut album in concert, and only &quot;Song to Woody&quot; and &quot;Pretty Peggy-O&quot; would be heard with any frequency.

== Outtakes ==
Three additional songs recorded during the &quot;Bob Dylan&quot; sessions were included on &quot;Volume 1&quot; of the Bootleg Series: &quot;House Carpenter&quot;, &quot;He Was a Friend of Mine&quot; and another original composition, &quot;Man on the Street&quot;. A fourth outtake, &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Blues&quot;, written by Woody Guthrie, remains unreleased.

Of these four, the most celebrated is perhaps &quot;House Carpenter&quot;, a new rendition of the 16th-century Scottish ballad &quot;The Daemon Lover&quot; and the final song recorded for &quot;Bob Dylan&quot;. Biographer Clinton Heylin described the song as &quot;the most extraordinary performance of the sessions, as demonically driven as anything Robert Johnson put out in his name&quot;. Though it was a favorite at the time in folk circles, Dylan apparently never played &quot;House Carpenter&quot; in any documented performance.

An alternate (shortened) version of &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;, heavily overdubbed with electric instruments in 1964 (produced by Tom Wilson), was later included on the &quot;Highway 61 Interactive&quot; CD-ROM.

==Critical reception ==

&quot;Bob Dylan&quot; did not receive acclaim until years later. &quot;These debut songs are essayed with differing degrees of conviction,&quot; writes music critic Tim Riley in 1999, &quot;[but] even when his reach exceeds his grasp, he never sounds like he knows he&#x27;s in over his head, or gushily patronizing … Like Elvis Presley, what Dylan can sing, he quickly masters; what he can&#x27;t, he twists to his own devices. And as with the Presley Sun sessions, the voice that leaps from Dylan&#x27;s first album is its most striking feature, a determined, iconoclastic baying that chews up influences, and spits out the odd mixed signal without half trying.&quot;

However, at the time of its release, &quot;Bob Dylan&quot; received little notice, and both Hammond and Dylan were soon dismissive of the album. The April 14, 1962, issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine highlighted it as a &#x27;special merit&#x27; release, saying, &#x27;[Dylan] is one of the most interesting, and most disciplined youngsters to appear on the pop-folk scene in a long time&#x27; with &#x27;moving readings of originals such as &quot;Song to Woody&quot; and &quot;Talkin&#x27; New York&quot;. Dylan when he finds his own style, could win a big following.&#x27; Despite this positive notice, the album also did not initially sell well, and Dylan was for a time known as &quot;Hammond&#x27;s Folly&quot; in record company circles. Mitch Miller, Columbia&#x27;s chief of A&amp;R at the time, said U.S. sales totaled about 2,500 copies. &quot;Bob Dylan&quot; remains Dylan&#x27;s only release not to chart whatsoever in the U.S., although it eventually reached in the UK charts in 1965. Despite the album&#x27;s poor sales, it was not a financial disaster because it was very cheap to record.

On December 22, 1961, a month to the day after &quot;Bob Dylan&quot;″s final session, Dylan was in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he and his friend Tony Glover paid a visit to their friend Bonnie Beecher. Dylan held an informal session at her apartment, performing 26 songs that Glover recorded on a reel-to-reel tape recorder. Often known by a misnomer, the &quot;Minneapolis Hotel Tape&quot; soon entered private circulation, providing a thorough look at Dylan&#x27;s musical potential only a month after recording his debut album. A larger and far more diverse selection of songs, it was all recorded the night of the 22nd in roughly two and a half hours.

Among the songs recorded that night were the harrowing, racially charged morality tale &quot;Black Cross&quot;, Big Joe Williams&#x27; &quot;Baby Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; (in which Dylan displays his growing skills at bottleneck guitar), the Pentecostal &quot;Wade in the Water&quot;, Dylan&#x27;s reinterpretation of the traditional &quot;Nine Hundred Miles&quot; (retitled &quot;I Was Young When I Left Home&quot; and later issued on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack&quot;), the traditional &quot;Poor Lazarus&quot;, a Memphis Jug Band arrangement of the traditional &quot;Stealin&#x27;&quot;, another rewritten folk song called &quot;Hard Times in New York Town&quot; (based on the traditional &quot;Hard Times in the Country Working on Ketty&#x27;s Farm&quot; and subsequently released on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot;), and the John Lomax discovery &quot;Dink&#x27;s Song&quot;. (According to Clinton Heylin, Lomax first heard the song &quot;in 1908 when, across the Brazos river from Texas A&amp;M College, he heard a lady called Dink sing her song.&quot;) First published in &quot;Folksong USA&quot;, Dylan&#x27;s &quot;hotel&quot; recording would later be included on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack&quot;.

Though only a few selections from the Minneapolis hotel tape were ever officially released, all twenty-six songs have been heavily bootlegged and celebrated by Greil Marcus, a music critic who wrote about the recordings in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. As Heylin writes, some of these songs gave Dylan &quot;an all-important clue as to how he might mold traditional melodies and sensibility to his own worldview&quot;. This would come to fruition when Dylan began work on his next album, &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;, a year later, by which time both Dylan&#x27;s reputation and his stockpile of original compositions had grown considerably.

&quot;Bob Dylan&quot; was re-released in 2010 as the first of a 9 CD boxset titled &quot;The Original Mono Recordings&quot;, with new liner notes by Greil Marcus on a 60 pages booklet.

Because its copyright expired in Europe in 2012, several editions have appeared in the EU from competing oldies labels. One edition from Hoodoo Records included 12 bonus tracks (1 single and 11 live radio recordings from 1961 to 1962) and a 16-page booklet.

<text>Grays (or Grays Thurrock) is the largest town in the borough and unitary authority area of Thurrock, in the ceremonial county of Essex, England. The town, which is both a former civil parish and one of Thurrock&#x27;s traditional Church of England parishes, is located on the north bank of the River Thames.

It is approximately to the east of central London, and east of the M25 motorway. Its economy is linked to Port of London industries, its own offices, retail and the Lakeside Shopping Centre at West Thurrock.

==History==
Archaeological evidence indicates that the area now occupied by Grays has been inhabited by humans since the Palaeolithic period.

Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary that he visited Grays on 24 September 1665 and apparently bought fish from the local fishermen. Parts of Grays and Chafford Hundred are set within three Victorian chalk pits; the largest two being the Lion Gorge, and the Warren Gorge. Another area of the Chafford Hundred residential development is built on a Victorian landfill site. Thurrock Town Hall on New Road in Grays was built in the 1980s; work on an extension began in January 2020.

In 1931 the parish had a population of 18,173. On 1 April 1936 the parish was abolished to form Thurrock.

On 23 October 2019, the bodies of 39 people were found in the back of a lorry at Waterglade Industrial Park in Eastern Avenue. They are believed to have been victims of human trafficking, or migrants being smuggled into Britain. The vehicle, registered in Bulgaria, was thought to have travelled to the UK through Purfleet from Zeebrugge. A 25-year-old lorry driver from Northern Ireland was arrested by Essex Police on suspicion of murder and pleaded guilty to manslaughter in April 2020. Essex Police launched an investigation afterwards and the lorry was moved to the nearby Port of Tilbury. It is the biggest murder investigation in the history of Essex police. On 26 May 2020, a total of 26 further suspects, most of whom Vietnamese nationals, were arrested in Belgium and France.

==Origin of the name==
The origin of the name &quot;Grays Thurrock&quot; comes in two parts. Thurrock is a Saxon name meaning &quot;the bottom of a ship&quot;. The element &quot;Grays&quot; comes from Henry de Grai, a descendant of the Norman knight Anchetil de Greye, who was granted the manor of Grays Thurrock in 1195 by Richard I.

== Geography ==
Grays contains the wards and residential areas of Grays Riverside, Grays Thurrock, Stifford Clays, Little Thurrock Blackshots, Little Thurrock Rectory and Chadwell St Mary. Parts of Chafford Hundred and North and South Stifford are also in Grays.

==Landmarks==

Local sites of interest include the Thameside Theatre, the Thurrock History Museum, Grays Beach, The White Hart, and the former State Cinema.

The Dell was of the earliest houses in Britain to be built of concrete. It was built on the instructions of Alfred Russel Wallace, who lived in the town from 1872 until 1876.

From the top of the Derby Road Bridge in Grays one can look down to Thurrock Yacht Club, Grays Beach children&#x27;s playground and the River Thames.

As well as Thurrock Yacht Club, Grays Beach is the site of the local landmark &quot;The Gull&quot;, a lightship built in 1860, which has lain on the foreshore for decades and is now in a serious state of dilapidation. The light from &quot;The Gull&quot; has now been removed, restored and installed on the foreshore of the yacht club.

The Thameside Theatre was built in 1971 and is the only theatre in Thurrock. In July 2021 Thurrock Council declared it to be surplus to budget requirements and announced plans for its closure. The Labour opposition in the council opposed the plans and an online petition calling for its preservation was signed by over 1000 residents. Grays native Russell Brand gave his support to saving the theatre on an Instagram post and pledged to perform a show there to help prevent its closure. In January 2022 Thurrock Council announced that they supported a counter proposal that will see the theatre remain open under community ownership. A group dedicated to saving the theatre began negotiating with the council, and had to provide it with an affordable business plan for the theatre by 13 July 2022. However, after an unnamed organisation expressed interest in buying the theatre, the council has delayed the deadline to September to allow it to put forward an alternative business plan.

The town is approximately to the east of London on the north bank of the River Thames and east of the M25 motorway. Its economy is linked to Port of London industries, its own offices, retail and Lakeside, West Thurrock. Its variously used riverside (from homes through wild bird-habitat marshland to importation, storage and distribution) faces Broadness Lighthouse in Kent.

==Education==
=== Primary education ===
Primary schools in Grays include:

* Quarry Hill Academy (formerly Quarry Hill Primary and Pre School)
* West Thurrock Academy (formerly West Thurrock Primary School)
* Belmont Castle Academy (formerly Stifford Primary School)
* Woodside Academy (formerly Woodside Primary School)
* Warren Primary School
* Thameside Primary School
* Deneholm Primary School
* St Thomas of Canterbury Catholic Primary School 
* Gateway Primary Free School

Quarry Hill Primary and Pre School and Thameside Primary School were formed from the amalgamations of failing infant and junior schools. Since then, both schools have received favourable grades from education watchdog Ofsted. Belmont Castle Academy was renamed in honour of Belmont Castle, a demolished gothic mansion that was located on the school site. The Gateway Primary Free School is situated on the site of Gateway Academy, and is the only primary school with free school status in Grays.

=== Secondary education ===
Secondary schools in Grays include:

* Hathaway Academy (formerly the Grays School Media Arts College)
* Gateway Academy (formerly the Gateway Community College)
* Grays Convent High School (formerly the Convent Day School)
* William Edwards School (formerly William Edwards School and Sports College)
* Thames Park Secondary School
* Orsett Heath Academy

Since 2007, all of these schools have had specialist school status. Gateway Academy and Hathaway Academy have specialisms in the arts. In the case of Hathaway Academy, these include digital media and the performing arts. Gateway Academy also specialises in design and engineering. William Edwards School and Orsett Heath Academy share a sports specialism, with both schools utilising the ability to admit 10% of their intake by academic aptitude in this subject, an ability granted to all sport specialist schools. Grays Convent High School maintains a language specialism and Thames Park Secondary School has specialisms in artificial intelligence and digital technology.

Gateway Academy was formed in 2003 from a fresh start merger of Torells School in Grays and St Chad&#x27;s School in Tilbury. The Torells School site has since been demolished and replaced by the sites of two special schools, Treetops School and Treetops Free School. Comedian Joe Pasquale and Olympic medallist Fatima Whitbread both attended Torells School. Footballers Chris Cohen and Max Porter went to William Edwards School. Actor, YouTuber and comedian Russell Brand attended the Grays School, making his acting debut at one of the school&#x27;s Bugsy Malone productions. Grays Convent High School was attended by journalist and former Thurrock MP candidate Polly Billington and runner Jessica Judd.

All of these schools are coeducational academies or free schools, with the exception of Grays Convent High School, which is instead a voluntary aided Catholic school for girls.

=== Further education ===
A sixth form was operated by Gateway Academy before 2014, but it closed that year. In 2011, Ofsted deemed the sixth form as satisfactory, which meant it required improvement. This was primarily because of concerns over the number of students dropping out, which was above average. Hathaway Academy intended to open a sixth form some time before the 2014/2015 academic year, but this never came to fruition.

Thurrock Technical College opened in 1952 on Dell Road. Between 1954 and 1957 the college was based in parts of the site of Grays County Technical High School (which would become Grays School) and Grays Hall. In 1960 it reopened on Woodview Road, later establishing a second campus in Aveley. The college later merged with Basildon College to form Thurrock and Basildon College, with the Woodview Campus remaining in operation. The college then amalgamated with South East Essex College of Arts and Technology in 2010, forming South Essex College. The Thurrock Campus relocated from Woodview Road to a new complex in Grays town centre in September 2014.

The local sixth form college is USP College Palmer&#x27;s Campus. Palmer&#x27;s dates back to 1706, when the merchant William Palmer founded a charity school for &quot;ten poore children&quot; of the parish of Grays Essex. The school was located in the local churchyard and evolved into a boys&#x27; school. In response to the enactment of the Elementary Education Act 1870, the school reopened on a new site on the hill above the town in 1874. A girls&#x27; school opened on the site in 1876. Both schools were grammar schools, operating on the same site until 1931, when the girls&#x27; school relocated to Chadwell Road. From this time, Palmer&#x27;s became a public school. This meant that students were no longer admitted on academic performance regardless of background and were instead admitted by fee. This was reversed in 1944, however wealthier students were still prioritised, even if they failed the 11+ exam required for enrolment. In 1971 the girls&#x27; school began its conversion into a sixth form college, reopening as Palmer&#x27;s College in 1972 after it amalgamated with the boys&#x27; school and Aveley County Technical High School. The college merged with Seevic College in August 2017, forming USP College.

There is also Thurrock Adult Community College which is located in multiple venues and community hubs across Thurrock and used to be based from Richmond Road in Grays.

==Transport==
Grays has good road links, being close to the A13 road and the M25 motorway. The A126 &quot;London Road&quot; is the main road which links Grays town centre with Lakeside Shopping Centre, Purfleet and Tilbury.

Grays railway station runs through the centre of the built-up core and is served by c2c services to London Fenchurch Street to the west and Shoeburyness to the east. The typical journey time into London is 35 minutes.

Grays bus station, outside the railway station, is a hub for most bus services in Thurrock. The bus services are operated by Ensignbus, First Essex and NIBS Buses.

==Media==
The town is served by BBC London and ITV London with television signals received from Crystal Palace TV transmitter, BBC South East and ITV Meridian can also be received from Bluebell Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Essex, Heart East, Radio Essex, Gateway 97.8, and Thames Delta Radio, a community based radio station.

The &quot;Thurrock Gazette&quot; is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

==Sports==
The area&#x27;s local football team is Grays Athletic, previously based in Grays but now in nearby Tilbury, which plays non-League football and has won the FA Trophy twice.

==Mathematics==
* Paolo Ruffini partially proves the Abel–Ruffini theorem that quintic or higher-order equations cannot be solved by a general formula.
* William Wallace becomes the first to publish the concept of the Simson line.

==Medicine==
* March – The Pneumatic Institution for research into the medical implications of newly discovered gases is established by Thomas Beddoes in Bristol.

<text>William Jason Reso (born November 30, 1973), better known by his ring name Christian Cage or Christian, is a Canadian professional wrestler and actor. He is signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he is the leader of The Patriarchy stable. He is a former two-time AEW TNT Champion and a one-time AEW World Trios Champion. He is widely known for his time with WWF/E. He is also recognized for his tenure in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).

Reso made his debut in 1995. He wrestled in Canadian independent promotions early in his career, where he competed in singles and tag team competition with his best friend Edge. In 1998, he signed a developmental contract with the then-World Wrestling Federation (WWF, renamed to WWE in 2002) and made his debut the same year, immediately capturing his first championship in the company, the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship, in his debut match. Edge and Christian formed a tag team and gained notoriety for their participation in Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches. They won the promotion&#x27;s World Tag Team Championship on seven occasions. They are considered one of the major teams that revived tag team wrestling during the Attitude Era. The team parted ways in 2001, after which, Christian held various singles titles in WWE, including the European, Hardcore, and Intercontinental Championships.

In 2005, Reso departed WWE and signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) under his Christian Cage ring name, after which, he won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship twice. He left TNA in late 2008 and re-signed with WWE in 2009, where he won the ECW Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship twice each until retiring in 2014 due to concussion issues. He was the 23rd Triple Crown Champion and 11th Grand Slam Champion in WWE history.

In March 2021, Cage made his debut for AEW, again reverting to his Christian Cage moniker, and officially resuming his in-ring wrestling career. Following this, he won the Impact World Championship on the first episode of &quot;AEW Rampage&quot; in 2021 (as AEW and Impact had a partnership at the time), and in 2023, he won his first title under the AEW banner in the AEW TNT Championship, which he has held twice. Additionally, he is a former one-time AEW World Trios Champion. In total, between WWE, AEW, and TNA, Cage has won 26 championships, including seven world championships and nine tag team titles. He has headlined multiple pay-per-view events between WWE, TNA and AEW, and was one of WWE&#x27;s most prolific pay-per-view performers.

== Early life ==
William Jason &quot;Jay&quot; Reso was born in Kitchener, Ontario, on November 30, 1973, the son of Canadian mother Carol and American father Randy Reso. He played ice hockey and was a wrestling fan as a child. He lived in Huntsville and East Luther-Grand Valley before moving to Orangeville, where he met Adam &quot;Edge&quot; Copeland, who became his best friend and tag team partner. They attended Orangeville District Secondary School together, from which they both graduated.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1994–1998) ===
In September 1994, Reso enrolled in a wrestling school run by Ron Hutchison at Sully&#x27;s Gym. One of his early ring names was Christian Cage, a combination of the names of actors Christian Slater and Nicolas Cage. Cage&#x27;s wrestling career began in June 1995 in a match against Zakk Wyld, which resulted in a draw. In 1997, he was a part of Thug Life, a stable that included Joe E. Legend, Zakk Wyld, Rhino Richards, and Copeland (under the name Sexton Hardcastle). As a tag team on the Canadian independent circuit, Reso and Copeland were known as High Impact and later The Suicide Blondes. The duo held titles in numerous promotions and competed in the United States and Japan. Reso won the East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA) Heavyweight Championship on July 18, 1998, which he held until October 15, 1999. When Copeland received a tryout match with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Reso went with him and they faced off in a non-televised tryout match, which Copeland was booked to win. After the tryout, once Copeland was promoted from his developmental status to touring with the WWF, he put in a good word for Reso and got him invited to Dory Funk Jr.&#x27;s WWF-affiliated Funking Conservatory training camp in 1998. After completing his training at the conservatory, Reso signed a contract with the WWF to become a full-time performer.

=== World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) (1998–2005) ===
==== The Brood (1998–1999) ====
When Reso came to the WWF, he shortened his ring name to Christian. Christian made his television debut as a heel at WWF&#x27;s pay-per-view event on September 27, distracting Edge during his match against Owen Hart to reveal his allegiance to Gangrel. Christian won the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship in his debut match against Taka Michinoku at Judgment Day: In Your House on October 18. He lost the title to Gillberg a month later.

Christian was given the character of a vampire and formed an alliance with Gangrel and Edge, who (in storyline) was finally persuaded to join what became known as The Brood. At Rock Bottom: In Your House on December 13, The Brood defeated The J.O.B. Squad in a six-man tag team match, then they briefly feuded with The Undertaker&#x27;s Ministry of Darkness and later joining the team, but upon learning that Christian was beaten into telling Ken Shamrock the whereabouts of Stephanie McMahon, The Undertaker punished Christian by flogging him. More loyal to The Brood than to The Ministry, Edge and Gangrel betrayed The Undertaker and rescued Christian from sacrifice.

==== Tag Team prominence with Edge (1999–2001) ====
In 1999, Christian and Edge parted ways with Gangrel, who associated himself with The Hardy Boyz (Jeff and Matt Hardy) to form The New Brood. As a result, they began feuding with The Hardy Boyz and competed in a ladder match for the managerial services of Terri Runnels and $100,000 at No Mercy on October 17, which The Hardy Boyz won. At WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, Edge and Christian defeated The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) to win their first WWF Tag Team Championship in a triangle ladder match, which ultimately led to the creation of the Tables, Ladders and Chairs (TLC) match. At Backlash on April 30, Edge and Christian defeated Road Dogg and X-Pac to retain titles. At Judgment Day on May 21, Christian, Edge and Kurt Angle lost a six-man tag team match to Rikishi and Too Cool, to whom they lost the titles soon after only to win them back in a four corners elimination match at King of the Ring on June 25. At Fully Loaded on July 23, Edge and Christian lost to The Acolytes Protection Agency (Bradshaw and Faarooq) by disqualification, but they retained the titles.
Following their victory, Edge and Christian portrayed themselves as heels, shifting their in-ring personas from borderline goth to a comedic pair of &quot;cool dudes&quot;. During this time, their trademark became the &quot;five second pose&quot;, where they performed a pose in the ring for five seconds &quot;for the benefit of those with flash photography&quot; to mock, insult, or amuse the fans. At SummerSlam on August 27, the Edge and Christian successfully defended the tag team titles in the first ever TLC match against The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley Boyz. At Unforgiven on September 24, Edge and Christian lost the titles against The Hardy Boyz in a steel cage match and were not allowed another title shot. At No Mercy on October 22, Edge and Christian (disguised as Los Conquistadores) defeated The Hardys for the titles. The next night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, The Hardy Boyz dressed as the Los Conquistadores and defeated Edge in a handicap match after Christian was taken out backstage to regain the WWF Tag Team Championship. At Survivor Series on November 19, Edge and Christian teamed with Right to Censor&#x27;s Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match which they lost to The Dudleys and The Hardyz. At Armageddon on December 10, Edge and Christian regained the tag team titles in a fatal four-way match involving The Dudley Boyz, K-Kwik and Road Dogg and The Right to Censor, but they lost them eight days later to The Rock and The Undertaker only to win them back days later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; thanks to special guest referee Kurt Angle. At the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001, Edge and Christian lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to The Dudley Boyz. At No Way Out on February 25, Edge and Christian were unsuccessful in regaining the tag team titles, but they eventually recaptured them in the second ever TLC match at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1.

On the April 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Edge and Christian were defeated by The Brothers of Destruction (Kane and The Undertaker) for the WWF Tag Team Championship. At Backlash on April 29, Christian was part of the triple threat match for the WWF European Championship which was won by Matt Hardy. At Judgment Day on May 21, Edge and Christian competed in a tag team turmoil match which was won by Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho. On the May 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Edge and Christian competed in a fatal four-way tag team TLC match for the WWF Tag Team Championship in which Benoit and Jericho retained the tag team titles.

After losing the tag team titles, friction arose within the team after Edge won the 2001 King of the Ring tournament on June 24. It was also during this time that Edge was becoming a face during The Invasion storyline. Christian briefly turned face to help feud with The Alliance. Christian turned heel shortly afterward, resulting in the two feuding for Edge&#x27;s WWF Intercontinental Championship for several months.

====The Un-Americans (2001–2002)====

At Unforgiven on September 23, Christian defeated Edge to win his first Intercontinental Championship, but he lost it back to Edge in a ladder match at No Mercy on October 21. Christian won the WWF European Championship from Bradshaw on the November 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. At Rebellion on November 3, Christian faced Edge in a steel cage match for the Intercontinental Championship, but he failed to win the title. At Survivor Series on November 18, Christian defeated Al Snow to retain the European Championship. Christian lost the European Championship to Diamond Dallas Page on the January 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

After a series of defeats, Christian announced he would quit the WWF, but Page persuaded him to reconsider and adopted him as his protégé. Christian betrayed Page and faced off against him for the European Championship at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, but he lost. Christian began throwing tantrums in his gimmick at the time whenever things did not go his way and during the same event defeated Mighty Molly to win the WWF Hardcore Championship, but lost the title to Maven later that night.

Christian formed an alliance with fellow Canadian wrestler Lance Storm on the June 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. On the June 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Test, another Canadian, joined their team, now called The Un-Americans. Christian and Storm won the WWE Tag Team Championship at Vengeance on July 21 by defeating Edge and Hollywood Hulk Hogan. The trio then defected from SmackDown! to the Raw brand, appearing on the July 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to attack The Undertaker. The Un-Americans teamed with Triple H, to defeat WWE Undisputed Champion The Rock, The Undertaker and Booker T and Goldust in an eight-man tag team match on the August 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after Test pinned The Undertaker. At SummerSlam on August 25, Christian and Storm retained the WWE Tag Team Championship against Booker T and Goldust, before interfering in Test&#x27;s match with The Undertaker later in the night, only to be tossed out of the ring and for The Undertaker to defeat Test. On the August 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Un-Americans attempted to burn the American flag, but were stopped by Booker T, Goldust and a returning Kane. On the September 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, William Regal joined the team. Regal, an Englishman, was the only member of the team not of Canadian nationality. At Unforgiven on September 22, The Un-Americans lost to Bubba Ray Dudley, Kane and Booker T and Goldust. The Un-Americans lost the WWE Tag Team Championship the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; to the team of The Hurricane and Kane. On the September 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, both Christian and Storm lost matches to Randy Orton, while Regal and Test lost to Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer. This led to all four members attacking each other, thus disbanding the team.

====Teaming and feuding with Chris Jericho (2002–2004)====
Christian formed a tag team with Chris Jericho and competed in a fatal four-way tag team TLC match for the World Tag Team Championship on the October 7 special episode of &quot;Raw Roulette&quot;, involving Kane, Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam and Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley. Despite Kane&#x27;s partner the Hurricane being absent from the match, he still retained the title. Christian and Jericho won the titles the next week on the October 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. At Armageddon on December 15, Christian and Jericho lost the World Tag Team Championship to Booker T and Goldust in a fatal four-way elimination match also involving the teams of The Dudley Boyz and Lance Storm and William Regal.

On January 19, 2003, Christian entered the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble and was eliminated by Jericho. After a short absence, Christian returned on the April 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, self-proclaiming himself as the new &quot;People&#x27;s Champion&quot; and began calling his fans &quot;The Peeps&quot; after receiving advice and endorsement from The Rock. On the May 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Christian faced Goldberg, but the match ended in a no contest when 3-Minute Warning got involved which led to a rematch on the May 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where Christian lost to Goldberg in a steel cage match. At Judgment Day on May 18, Christian went on to win a nine-man over-the-top-rope battle royal for his second Intercontinental Championship. Christian lost the Intercontinental Championship to Booker T on the July 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, but he regained it after Booker T was legitimately injured at a house show on August 10.

At Unforgiven on September 21, Christian defeated Chris Jericho and Rob Van Dam to retain the title in a triple threat match, but later lost the title to Van Dam in a ladder match on the September 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. At Survivor Series on November 16, Christian was a part of Team Bischoff taking on Team Austin and during the match he eliminated Bubba Ray Dudley before he was eliminated by Shawn Michaels, though in the end Team Bischoff eventually won the match. At Armageddon on December 14, Christian and Jericho defeated Lita and Trish Stratus in an intergender tag team match billed as the &quot;Battle of the Sexes.&quot;

At WrestleMania XX on March 14, 2004, Christian faced Jericho in a singles match with Stratus on Jericho&#x27;s side, but Stratus accidentally struck Jericho, allowing Christian to defeat Jericho. Stratus then joined forces with Christian, becoming his on-screen girlfriend in the process. As Christian feuded with Jericho, he introduced his own personal bodyguard, Tyson Tomko, which he dubbed his personal &quot;problem solver&quot;. At Backlash on April 18, Christian and Stratus faced Jericho in an intergender handicap match which they lost. During a steel cage match against Jericho on the May 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; which he lost, Christian suffered a severe back injury, causing him to miss almost four months of in-ring action. Christian returned on the August 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, attacking Jericho and thus resuming their feud. The two had a ladder match for the vacant Intercontinental Championship at Unforgiven on September 12, which Christian lost, ending their feud.

==== Final storylines; departure (2004–2005) ====
At Survivor Series on November 14, Christian failed to win the Intercontinental Championship from Shelton Benjamin. At New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 9, 2005, Christian and Tyson Tomko faced Eugene and William Regal for the World Tag Team Championship, but they failed to win the titles. At the Royal Rumble on January 30, Christian competed in the Royal Rumble match, but he was eliminated by eventual winner Batista.

Christian participated in the first-ever Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 21 on April 3, but he failed to win as the match was won by Edge. Following this, Christian, who had an encounter with SmackDown! wrestler John Cena, began commenting on Cena, claiming he was a better rapper than Cena and denouncing him as &quot;poseur&quot; while being noticeably cheered during these segments. Soon after, then-WWE Champion Cena was drafted to the Raw brand on the June 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where Cena successfully defended the WWE Championship in a triple threat match against Christian and Chris Jericho at Vengeance on June 26.

On the June 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Christian was drafted to the SmackDown! brand in the 2005 WWE draft lottery and replaced Big Show (who was drafted to Raw) in a six-man elimination match for the newly created SmackDown! Championship, but he lost to John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL). Soon after, Christian was given his own interview segment on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; called &quot;The Peep Show&quot;. At The Great American Bash on July 24, Christian faced Booker T in a losing effort. At No Mercy on October 9, Christian competed in a fatal four-way match for the United States Championship which was won by Chris Benoit.

On October 31, his contract with WWE expired. According to wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, Reso was asked on the spot to sign a new contract, but he declined. According to Reso, during his feud with John Cena he noticed that, despite his popularity, the WWE didn&#x27;t see him as a main eventer and needed to prove himself. His last match occurred during the tapings for the November 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, where he and JBL lost to Rey Mysterio and Matt Hardy. Despite his quitting, Christian appeared on the October 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and at Taboo Tuesday on November 1.

Before leaving WWE, Reso filed to trademark the nickname of &quot;Captain Charisma&quot;, which allowed him to use it as Christian Cage in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), but after WWE disputed the trademark claim by citing a provision in the terms of his old contract he stopped officially using it on TNA programming by the summer of 2006, calling himself &quot;The Instant Classic&quot; from early 2007 onwards although he still continued to be referred to as &quot;Captain Charisma&quot; in off-screen appearances and sometimes wore his &quot;Captain Charisma&quot; entrance jumpsuits to the ring at live events.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005–2008, 2012)===
==== NWA World Heavyweight Champion (2005–2007) ====

On November 13, 2005, Reso made his debut as a face in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) at TNA&#x27;s pay-per-view event Genesis under his old ring name Christian Cage. He announced his intentions to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship held by Jeff Jarrett and rejected joining Scott D&#x27;Amore&#x27;s faction, Team Canada.

Cage would defeat Monty Brown at Turning Point on December 11 to become number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. At Final Resolution on January 15, 2006, Cage teamed with Sting to defeat the team of Monty Brown and Jeff Jarrett. and defeated Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Against All Odds on February 12. Cage had his first title defence at Destination X on March 12, where he defeated Brown to retain the title. On the March 25 and April 1 respective &quot;Impact!&quot; episodes, Abyss, his manager Father James Mitchell and Alex Shelley showed two pre-taped video packages that had been compiled in the weeks before the episodes, with first on March 25 depicting Mitchell stalking Cage&#x27;s wife Denise, confronting her and even threatening that &quot;they were coming&quot;. The second aired on April 1, with Abyss, accompanied by Mitchell and Shelley, who was taping the segment with a camcorder like the previous video package, attacking Cage at his home in Tampa, Florida and nearly drowning Cage in his own pool. This storyline led to Cage facing Abyss at Lockdown on April 23 in a six sides of steel cage match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, with Cage winning and attempting after the match to attack Mitchell and gain revenge for all his recent evil deeds against Cage and his family, but Abyss stopped him, took a steel chain, wrapped it around Cage&#x27;s neck and attempted to hang him with it until he passed out, after which Abyss and Mitchell stole the title belt and left the arena. The storyline between Abyss and Mitchell and Cage continued until Sacrifice on May 14, where Cage defeated Abyss to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship under Full Metal Mayhem rules.

At Slammiversary on June 18, Cage lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Jeff Jarrett in a King of the Mountain match, which also involved Abyss, Ron Killings and Sting. Larry Zbyszko and referee Earl Hebner intervened at the end of the match by helping Jarrett win. The title was declared until TNA&#x27;s main authority figure at the time, Management Director Jim Cornette, awarded the title belt back to Jarrett on the June 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; on the condition that he defend it against the winner of a four-way match involving Cage, Samoa Joe, Scott Steiner and Sting at Victory Road on July 16. Jarrett agreed to the condition and Sting became the new number one contender at Victory Road.
After Victory Road, Cage befriended the new number one contender Sting on the July 27 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; by asking for forgiveness for doubting Sting&#x27;s agenda by coming to TNA in January of that year. Cage went on to say that he had asked Cornette the week before if he could be in Sting&#x27;s corner in his match with Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Hard Justice on August 13, but Cornette had told him he needed Sting&#x27;s approval. Sting accepted Cage&#x27;s offer, with interviewer and occasional ring announcer Jeremy Borash announcing Sting&#x27;s decision in a backstage segment on the August 3 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. At Hard Justice, Cage was in Sting&#x27;s corner at Hard Justice as he faced Jarrett (with Scott Steiner in his corner) and during the contest interfered to help Sting win numerous times—as did Steiner for Jarrett—until Cage turned on Sting by taking Jarrett&#x27;s signature guitar and bashing it over his head—turning heel in the process. Cage then allowed Jarrett to pin Sting and retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

After Hard Justice, Cage began a feud with Rhino as Rhino questioned Cage on his actions at Hard Justice on the August 17 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, but Cage replied saying he did it for the good of TNA. Cage went on to explain later in the episode during a sit-down interview with TNA commentator Mike Tenay that he attacked Sting because he felt Sting did not show enough passion during the encounter to &quot;get the job done&quot; and win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The following week on &quot;Impact!&quot;, Cage came down to the ring where he addressed his attack on Sting further until he was interrupted by Rhino, who attacked after a small debate, starting a brawl between the two which came to an end after Cage laid Rhino&#x27;s head on a steel chair, picked up another chair and bashed it over the outside of Rhino&#x27;s head performing a one-man con-chair-to in the process. This led to a match against Rhino at No Surrender on September 24, which Cage won. A rematch was held at Bound for Glory on October 22, which Cage also won under 8 Mile Street Fight rules. They had their final bout on the November 16 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, where Cage defeated Rhino in a barbed wire six sides of steel cage match.

Cage&#x27;s old WWE enforcer Tyson Tomko (now going simply by Tomko) made his TNA debut on the November 23 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; helping Cage in a match against Sting. With Tomko at his side, Cage set his sights on the NWA World Heavyweight Championship now held by Abyss and at Turning Point on December 10 fought Abyss and Sting in a three-way match for the title, but he failed to win the match as Abyss won to retain the championship after pinning Sting. Cage fought for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship once again at Final Resolution on January 14, 2007 against Abyss and Sting, this time in a three-way elimination match that he won by pinning Sting after Abyss was already eliminated to win the championship. After Final Resolution, Cage prepared for his title defence against the new number one contender Kurt Angle, who had defeated Samoa Joe in a 30-minute Iron Man match at Final Resolution to gain the opportunity. Heading into their encounter at Against All Odds on February 11, Cage announced on the January 17 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; that he had hired a special consultant to assist him in training for his bout with Angle. This consultant was revealed on the February 8 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, who turned out to be Scott Steiner after he attacked Angle following a match pitting the team of Angle and Joe against Cage and A.J. Styles. Cage went on to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Angle at Against All Odds with Joe as the unofficial special outside enforcer.

====Christian&#x27;s Coalition and departure (2007–2008)====
On the March 8 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Cage proclaimed that he, Tomko and Scott Steiner were an &quot;inseparable family&quot;, which he called Christian&#x27;s Coalition. After a short feud with Samoa Joe, culminating in a victory for Cage at Destination X on March 11 for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, Cage was announced as a captain of a five-man team for the Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown against Team Angle during the March 15, 2007 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. At Lockdown on April 15, Team Cage (Cage, Tomko, Steiner, A.J. Styles and Abyss) went on to lose to Team Angle (Angle, Joe, Rhino, Sting and Jeff Jarrett). A stipulation was added that the wrestler who got the pinfall would become number one contender for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and have their title shot at Sacrifice. Sting was the individual who gained the pinfall victory for Team Angle and became the new number one contender.
Abyss was later kicked out of the group after he attacked Cage on the April 19 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. Steiner was the next to leave the group after he was attacked by Tomko following their NWA World Tag Team Championship match at Sacrifice. Cage was set to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Sting at Sacrifice, but Angle was added to the match on the May 3, 2007 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, making it a three-way match. At Sacrifice on May 13, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), the owners of the NWA World Heavyweight and the NWA World Tag Team Championships, stripped Cage and Team 3D of the titles. NWA Executive Director Robert K. Trobich stated the reason was that Cage refused to defend the NWA world title at NWA live events. Cage, still holding the physical NWA world title belt, defended what was billed as the World Heavyweight Championship against Sting and Angle, who was the victor of said contest by making Sting submit (who had &quot;technically&quot; just pinned Cage at the very same moment) and was announced as the new World Heavyweight Champion. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Angle came to the ring with a new championship belt in-tow and announced he was the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion, a championship that TNA had just introduced at Sacrifice. Afterwards, Cage and Sting came to the ring and the three began to argue over who was the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion, but due to the controversial finish to their match at Sacrifice the title was declared vacant by Cornette and a tournament was held for the title which culminated in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary on June 17. Cage won entry into the match on the June 14 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; by defeating Abyss. At Slammiversary, Cage failed to defeat the four other men (Styles, Joe, Angle and Chris Harris) and win the title as Angle hung the title belt to become the new and undisputed TNA World Heavyweight Champion.

After defeating Harris at Victory Road on July 17 and him, Tomko and Styles losing to the team of Andrew Martin, Sting and Abyss at Hard Justice on August 12 in a Doomsday Chamber of Blood match to become number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, Cage restarted his feud with Samoa Joe and the two met at No Surrender on September 9, where he defeated Joe by disqualification when Joe refused to release his rear naked choke submission hold he had applied. The two had a rematch with Matt Morgan as the special outside enforcer at Bound for Glory on October 14, where Cage lost to Joe and ended his 23-month-long undefeated streak by not officially being pinned nor made to submit. Cage and Joe fought one more time on the October 18 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, with a spot in the 2007 Fight for the Right tournament to become number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Cage defeated Joe to gain entry. Cage made it all the way to the final round of the tournament, where he fought Kaz on the November 8 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, defeating Kaz due to interference from Styles and Tomko on Cage&#x27;s behalf, but the match was declared a no contest, with the finals being determined in a ladder match at Genesis on November 11. He lost the tournament final the second time around at Genesis. Later in the night, Styles and Tomko helped Angle retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship during the main event as Cage looked on from the ramp. Styles and Tomko were later announced as members of Angle&#x27;s new group, The Angle Alliance, which led to a title match between the two at Final Resolution on January 6, 2008 and also turning Cage face in the process.
On the January 3 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tomko left both Christian&#x27;s Coalition and The Angle Alliance. Cage failed to win the title at Final Resolution as a result of Styles&#x27; betraying and attacking him during the bout, ending Christian&#x27;s Coalition. At Against All Odds on February 10, Cage got a rematch against Angle with Samoa Joe as the special outside enforcer, but he once again was defeated by Angle as this time Tomko interfered and cost Cage the match.

In 2012, Reso made a one night return to TNA at Slammiversary 10 under his old ring name Christian Cage to announce the number one moment in TNA history as voted by the TNA fans (Sting&#x27;s 2006 return in the aforementioned Final Resolution tag team main event).

On the July 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, it was announced that Christian would compete in the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match at Money in the Bank on July 18, which he lost. In September 2010, Christian tore his pectoral muscle and was expected to be sidelined for approximately six months. Following surgery, WWE released a statement that revealed he was expected to only be sidelined for four months. The injury was put into a storyline with Alberto Del Rio attacking Christian backstage on the September 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. Christian made his return from injury at Elimination Chamber on February 20, 2011, saving Edge from an attack by Del Rio. On the March 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Christian saved Edge from another attack by Del Rio. On the March 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Christian made his in-ring return from injury against Del Rio&#x27;s bodyguard Brodus Clay, picking up the victory. On the March 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Christian reunited with Edge and defeated Del Rio and Clay in a tag team match. On the March 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Christian defeated Del Rio in a steel cage match, but was afterwards attacked by both Del Rio and Clay. Christian was in the corner of Edge when he retained the World Heavyweight Championship against Del Rio at WrestleMania XXVII on April 3.

On the April 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Christian lost to Del Rio in a number one contender&#x27;s match for the World Heavyweight Championship after a distraction from Brodus Clay.

On the May 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Christian lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Randy Orton ending his reign at 2 days (5 recognized by WWE due to tape delay). At Over the Limit on May 22, Christian failed to regain the World Heavyweight Championship from Orton. On the June 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Christian was the special referee for a World Heavyweight Championship defence by Orton against Sheamus, which Orton won only to be hit by Christian after the match with the title belt, turning heel in the process. At Capitol Punishment on June 19, Christian faced Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship once again, but he failed to capture the title as the referee missed his foot under the bottom rope. At Money in the Bank on July 17, Christian won the World Heavyweight Championship for the second and final time after Orton was disqualified for kicking him in the groin (the stipulation was if Orton was disqualified or the referee made a bad call, he would lose the title). At SummerSlam on August 14, Christian lost the World Heavyweight Championship back to Orton in a No Holds Barred match. On the August 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, special guest General Manager Bret Hart announced that Christian would face Orton in a steel cage match on the August 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; for the title, which Christian lost to end their feud.

In December, Christian briefly appeared at the Slammy Awards and Tribute to the Troops.

==== Championship pursuits and injuries (2012–2014) ====

At Elimination Chamber on February 19, 2012, Christian returned from his injury to show support for John Laurinaitis. Christian appeared on the March 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, hosting an episode of &quot;The Peep Show&quot; and given a spot on Laurinaitis&#x27; team in a 12-man tag match at WrestleMania XXVIII on April 1. On the March 26 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Christian was injured once again after (kayfabe) re-aggravating his neck and shoulder in a match with CM Punk. Despite the injury, Christian still appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony to induct long-time friend Edge.

Christian made his return at Over the Limit on May 20, as a face, where he won a battle royal and defeated Cody Rhodes later in the show to win his fourth Intercontinental Championship. At No Way Out on June 17, Christian retained the Intercontinental Championship against Rhodes in a rematch. At &quot;Raw 1000&quot; on July 23, Christian lost the Intercontinental Championship to The Miz ending his reign at 63 days and failed to regain it in a rematch the same week on &quot;SmackDown&quot;.

After a ten-month absence, Christian returned from injury on the June 17, 2013 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Wade Barrett. At Money in the Bank on July 14, Christian competed in the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match, but was unsuccessful as the match was won by Randy Orton. On the July 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Christian defeated World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio in a non-title match. That same week on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Christian defeated Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam in a triple threat match to become number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship, after which he was attacked by Del Rio during a post-match interview. On the August 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Christian again defeated Del Rio in a non-title match. At SummerSlam on August 18, Christian failed in his title challenge against Del Rio. On the September 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Shield dragged out an assaulted Christian as a message to anyone that disrespected Triple H following Edge&#x27;s opinion on Triple H&#x27;s recent abuse of power. On that week&#x27;s &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge promised Christian would return soon and get his payback. Christian returned and appeared on the 2013 Slammy Awards, where he presented an award and appeared in a segment involving John Cena and Randy Orton.

Christian returned on the January 31, 2014 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; to defeat Jack Swagger in a qualifying match for the Elimination Chamber match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. On the February 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Christian attacked Daniel Bryan from behind and mocked Bryan during the match, turning heel. At Elimination Chamber on February 23, Christian eliminated Sheamus before being eliminated by Daniel Bryan. On the March 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Christian won a fatal four-way match including Alberto Del Rio, Dolph Ziggler and Sheamus to challenge Big E for the Intercontinental Championship, which did not come to fruition due to Christian suffering a concussion.

====First retirement and sporadic appearances (2014–2019)====

After suffering his concussion, Christian appeared as a face on pre-show discussion panels for WWE for events including NXT TakeOver, Money in the Bank and Battleground. He then went on to host &quot;The Peep Show&quot; program with Chris Jericho at Night of Champions in September, and with Dean Ambrose on the November 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;.
Edge and Christian were the guest hosts for the December 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where WWE commentator Jerry Lawler referred to Christian as &quot;retired&quot;. &quot;Pro Wrestling Insider&quot; corroborated Lawler&#x27;s statement, adding that because of multiple concussions and other injuries, the company considered Christian retired as an active wrestler. On the March 2, 2016 episode of &quot;Talk Is Jericho&quot;, Christian said that while he has had no formal discussion with management regarding his retirement, he would be unlikely to wrestle again. He confirmed his status on the September 22, 2017 edition of &quot;E&amp;C&#x27;s Pod of Awesomeness&quot;, saying: &quot;I had to retire, like, right around 40... &#x27;cause of the concussion stuff&quot;.

Starting on February 21, 2016, Reso began appearing along with Edge in the WWE Network exclusive &quot;The Edge and Christian Show That Totally Reeks of Awesomeness&quot;, but in July 2017 it was announced that the show was cancelled from the Network. In mid-May 2016, it became known that Reso had been released from his talent contract. On the June 22, &quot;Talk Is Jericho&quot; podcast focusing on the Chris Benoit tragedy, Jericho mentioned Christian as an example of modern wrestlers who had to retire as the WWE would no longer give them medical clearances due to concussion related injuries (this was largely as a consequence of the Benoit incident as well as better knowledge of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and other concussion related risks).

At the &quot;Raw 25 Years&quot; event on January 22, 2018, Christian hosted &quot;The Peep Show&quot; with special guests Jason Jordan and Seth Rollins, but it was later interrupted by The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus). On April 7, Christian appeared with Edge to induct the Dudley Boyz into the WWE Hall of Fame. In October 2019, Christian started appearing as a regular contributor on &quot;WWE Backstage&quot;.

====In-ring return and departure (2020–2021)====
On the June 8, 2020 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Christian hosted &quot;The Peep Show&quot; with special guest Edge, who had returned to competition in January and was feuding with Randy Orton. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Christian was challenged to an unsanctioned match by Orton. Christian, who had no offense in the match, quickly lost after a low blow from Ric Flair, which was followed by a punt kick from Orton. At Clash of Champions, Christian got revenge on Orton by attacking him during his ambulance match against Drew McIntyre for the WWE Championship. He then appeared as a surprise entrant in the 2021 Royal Rumble match, entering at number 24 and lasting over 18 minutes before being eliminated by Seth Rollins. During the match, he briefly reunited with Edge, who would eventually win by last eliminating Orton. Following this, it was reported that Reso was no longer under contract with WWE.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2021–present) ===
====Storyline with Jungle Boy (2021–2023)====

Reso made his surprise debut for All Elite Wrestling (AEW) as Christian Cage and signed a multi-year contract at Revolution on March 7, 2021. At Double or Nothing on May 30, Cage participated in the Casino Battle Royale, but he was the last competitor eliminated by the eventual winner Jungle Boy. Soon after, he would begin a partnership with Jungle Boy and become his mentor. Cage faced Kenny Omega, defeating him for the Impact World Championship on the premiere episode of &quot;Rampage&quot; on August 13, but losing at All Out in a match for the AEW World Championship, marking Cage&#x27;s first loss in AEW. At the Revolution event on March 6, 2022, Cage competed in the Face of the Revolution ladder match for a future opportunity at the AEW TNT Championship, but the match was won by Wardlow.

On the June 15 special episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot; titled Road Rager, Cage attacked Jungle Boy after he and Luchasaurus lost the AEW World Tag Team Championship to The Young Bucks in a ladder match, turning heel for the first time in AEW. Cage would initiate a rivalry with Jungle Boy, mocking him for the death of his father, famed actor Luke Perry. Cage and Jungle Boy would face in a match at the All Out event on September 4, where Cage defeated Jungle Boy in 20 seconds after Luchasaurus attacked him and allied himself with Cage. Following this, it was revealed that Cage had suffered a triceps injury, which would render him unable to compete for the next six to nine months. Cage returned from his injury on the February 15, 2023 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, attacking Jungle Boy. At Revolution, he was defeated by Jungle Boy in a Final Burial match, ending their rivalry.

==== The Patriarchy (2023–present)====

At Double or Nothing on May 28, Cage lost to Wardlow in a ladder match for the AEW TNT Championship. Wardlow then lost the title to Luchasaurus, with Cage&#x27;s help, on the premiere episode of &quot;Collision&quot;, on June 17. Cage then started a new storyline where he claimed to be the AEW TNT Champion and would carry the championship around with him, despite the actual champion being Luchasaurus. Cage&#x27;s new character would receive acclaim from critics, audiences and other wrestlers; fellow AEW wrestler MJF opined that Cage was the &quot;best he&#x27;s been in his entire career&quot;. Cage and Luchasaurus would begin a feud with Darby Allin over the championship. On the August 23 edition of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Cage was added to the tag team coffin match at All In, following AR Fox&#x27;s removal from the Mogul Embassy, replacing Fox and teaming with Swerve Strickland to face Allin and Sting. On August 27 at All In, Cage and Strickland were defeated by Allin and Sting, who threw Strickland in the coffin to win the match. The following week at All Out on September 3, Cage helped Luchasaurus defeat Allin to retain the AEW TNT Championship. On the September 23 episode of &quot;Collision&quot;, Cage pinned Luchasaurus in a triple threat match (also involving Allin) to become the new AEW TNT Champion.
At WrestleDream on October 1, Cage defeated Allin in a two out of three falls match to retain the AEW TNT Championship. After the match, Cage, Luchasaurus, and Nick Wayne (who turned on Allin) assaulted Allin and Sting; they were interrupted by the debuting Adam Copeland, known as Edge in WWE, who ran out to confront Cage and save Allin. Cage&#x27;s faction was later called The Patriarchy, with Cage being recognized as &quot;The Patriarch&quot; of the faction. At Full Gear on November 18, The Patriarchy lost to Copeland, Sting and Allin in a six-man tag team match. On the following episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Cage renamed Luchasaurus as Killswitch (after his finishing move) and Wayne as &quot;The Prodigy&quot; Nick Wayne. On the December 6 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Cage successfully defended the AEW TNT Championship against Copeland, after Shayna Wayne (Wayne&#x27;s mother) hit Copeland with the title belt in retaliation for taking out Nick. On the December 23 episode of &quot;Collision&quot;, Cage accepted Copeland&#x27;s challenge to a no disqualification match for the AEW TNT Championship at Worlds End on December 30, while announcing that Shayna Wayne had joined The Patriarchy as &quot;The Matriarch&quot; Mother Wayne. At Worlds End, Cage lost the title to Copeland, ending his reign at 98 days. Immediately after the match, Cage demanded and invoked Killswitch&#x27;s AEW TNT Championship title shot (which Killswitch had won earlier that night) and defeated Copeland to win the AEW TNT Championship for the second time. On the March 20, 2024 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Cage lost the AEW TNT Championship to Copeland in an I Quit match, ending his second reign at 81 days and ending their six-month feud.

On the May 1 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Cage returned from an almost two-month hiatus as the challenger for Swerve Strickland&#x27;s AEW World Championship at Double or Nothing on May 26, where he failed to win the title from Strickland. On the June 15 episode of &quot;Collision&quot;, Cage declared that he would challenge for the AEW World Championship again but would first challenge for the AEW World Trios Championship with Killswitch and Wayne. On the July 21 episode of &quot;Collision&quot;, The Patriarchy defeated the Bang Bang Gang (Juice Robinson and The Gunns) for the vacant AEW World Trios Championship, after interference from Mother Wayne. This is Cage&#x27;s first six-man tag team championship win of his career. On August 25 at All In, The Patriarchy lost the AEW World Trios Championship in a four-way London ladder match to Pac and Blackpool Combat Club (Claudio Castagnoli and Wheeler Yuta), ending their reign at 37 days. Later in the show, Cage won a Casino Gauntlet match to earn the right to challenge for the AEW World Championship whenever he wants. Two weeks later at All Out on September 7, Cage attempted to cash-in his AEW World Championship match contract on Bryan Danielson after Danielson successfully defended his title against Jack Perry but was blocked by the Blackpool Combat Club. On November 23 at Full Gear, Cage attempted to cash-in on champion Jon Moxley but would be blocked again, this time by Jay White.

=== Return to Impact Wrestling (2021) ===

On August 13, 2021 on the premiere episode of &quot;Rampage&quot;, Cage defeated Kenny Omega to win the Impact World Championship. On the August 19, 2021 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, as the new Impact World Champion, he made his first Impact appearance since 2012. The announcers recognized his previous two NWA World Heavyweight Championship reigns, though this recent reign was his first under the Impact World Championship lineage. Upon his return, he retired the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and considered the Impact World Championship the sole world title belt in the promotion. He was then confronted by Brian Myers, his challenger at Emergence, a match which Cage won. He then retained his title against Ace Austin at Victory Road. On the October 7 episode of Impact!, Cage and Josh Alexander defeated Ace Austin and Madman Fulton. At Bound for Glory on October 23, Cage lost the title to Josh Alexander.

==Professional wrestling style and persona==

Like many prominent wrestlers with lengthy careers, Christian&#x27;s character has evolved considerably over the years. When he debuted on the national stage, he was a scowling goth figure who never spoke. Ironically, he later became known for both his interview skills and, when a babyface, his humorous, fun-loving, surfer-type persona. As a villain, Christian is typically self-absorbed, vindictive and occasionally sadistic while still retaining quick wit.

Christian began to build up a loyal fanbase around the spring of 2005, despite his placement as a villain; he referred to them as his &quot;Peeps&quot;, &quot;Peepulation&quot; (a play on the word &quot;population&quot;), or the &quot;Christian Coalition&quot;. He also hosted a talk show segment called &quot;The Peep Show&quot; which sometimes gets co-hosted by Edge called &quot;The Cutting Edge Peep Show&quot;.

As a finisher, Christian uses an inverted double underhook facebuster, called the Killswitch. He also utilized a spear as tribute to his best friend Edge, as well as a frog splash in memory of Eddie Guerrero.

== Personal life ==
While on tour with WWE in England, Reso met German model Denise Hartmann; they were married on May 25, 2001. In December 2013, Reso announced the birth of his daughter during the time he had taken off due to recurring post-concussive symptoms. On May 2, 2019, Hartmann filed for divorce from Reso. The divorce was finalized in January 2020.

== Other media ==
In 2007, TNA Home Video released a DVD titled &quot;The Instant Classic: Christian Cage&quot;, covering his beginnings in the independent circuit and other various subjects up to his second NWA World Heavyweight Championship reign. Reso is also the host of the DVD &quot;The Ladder Match 2: Crash and Burn&quot;. In September 2015, Edge and Christian were guests on the &quot;Stone Cold Steve Austin Podcast&quot;, which aired on the WWE Network. Edge and Christian were also the hosts and stars of a WWE Network sketch comedy series titled &quot;The Edge and Christian Show That Totally Reeks of Awesomeness&quot;, which had two seasons, the first of which aired from February to May 2016 with the second from November 2018 to February 2019.

Christian has been a playable character in several of WWE&#x27;s video games, including &quot;WWF Attitude&quot; (1999), &quot;WWF WrestleMania 2000&quot; (1999), &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot; (2000), &quot;WWF No Mercy&quot; (2000), &quot;WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role&quot; (2000), &quot;WWF/E With Authority!&quot; (2001), &quot;WWF Road to WrestleMania&quot; (2001), &quot;WWF SmackDown!

<doc id="438905" wikidata="Q335370" url="?curid=438905" title="Gerald Gardiner, Baron Gardiner">
<text>Gerald Austin Gardiner, Baron Gardiner, (30 May 1900 – 7 January 1990) was a British Labour politician, who served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1964 to 1970. In that position he embarked on a programme of reform, most importantly setting up the Law Commission in 1965.

==Early life and education==
Gardiner was born in Chelsea, London. His father was Robert Septimus Gardiner (died 16 November 1939) and his mother was Alice von Ziegesar (died 31 January 1953), daughter of Count von Ziegesar and granddaughter of Dionysius Lardner. He attended Harrow School. 

While Gardiner was at Magdalen College, Oxford in the 1920s, he became president of the Oxford Union and of the Oxford University Dramatic Society. He was rusticated (suspended) in 1921, and was again threatened with rustication in November 1922, for publishing a pamphlet attacking restrictions on women undergraduates. A woman undergraduate had suffered the same fate a few days previously for climbing into a men&#x27;s college after a dance. Gardiner rushed to her defence and the Vice-Chancellor, Lewis Richard Farnell, notoriously out of touch with the post-war generation, asked Gardiner to leave at 06:00; any later, Farnell knew, would have meant a sympathetic funeral procession several hundred strong. The girl to whose defence Gardiner had come was Dilys Powell, who later became a film critic. Gardiner graduated with a fourth-class degree in jurisprudence in 1923.

While occupying the position of Chancellor of the Open University, he took a degree in the Social Sciences, at the age of 76.

==Pacifism==
Gerald Gardiner served in the Coldstream Guards in 1918 and was commissioned in 1919, but in the 1930s he joined the Peace Pledge Union. During World War II Gardiner volunteered to join the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit, as an alternative to military service, although he was actually just over conscription age, and served 1943 to 1945; as someone relatively mature, he was usefully able to lead a 55-strong team assisting refugees in the turmoil of North-West Europe in the last year of the war.

==Legal career==
Gardiner was called to the Bar in 1925 and was made King&#x27;s Counsel in 1948. As a lawyer, he fought for the abolition of capital punishment. He represented &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; and its columnist &#x27;Cassandra&#x27; (William Connor) in a notable libel trial in 1959 when the pianist Liberace claimed that a newspaper article imputed that he was homosexual. More successfully, he was the Counsel for the Defence in R v Penguin Books Ltd, the trial for obscenity of the publishers of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; in 1960. He played an active role in various reform movements and held numerous professional positions. He was a member of the Committee on Supreme Court Practice and Procedure, 1947–53 chaired by Raymond Evershed, 1st Baron Evershed. He was a member of the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Law Reform Committee, 1952–63. He was a Master of the Bench of the Inner Temple in 1955, Chairman of the General Council of the Bar in 1958 and 1959. He was a member of the International Commission of Jurists in 1971. He was Joint Chairman of the National Campaign for Abolition of Capital Punishment.

==Lord Chancellorship==
Gardiner stood for election as the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate in the 1951 General Election in Croydon West. He lost to the Conservative, Richard Thompson. In the 1964 New Year Honours he was made a life peer as Baron Gardiner, of Kittisford in the County of Somerset. On the Labour Party&#x27;s General Election victory in 1964, he was appointed Lord Chancellor and to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1964 by Harold Wilson. In 1970, the Labour Party was defeated in the General Election and Lord Gardiner resigned as Lord Chancellor. In that role, he was responsible for the creation of the Ombudsman. He also did much to advance women&#x27;s rights.

===Security surveillance===
During debates on the British Telecommunications Bill in the House of Lords in 1981, various members raised concerns about telephone tapping, a matter of disquiet in the community and amongst these members. In his contribution, Lord Gardiner told of the difficulties he experienced as Lord Chancellor (1964–1970) in being able to conduct strictly private discussions with the then Attorney-General. Lord Gardiner said he believed his telephone calls were intercepted by a British intelligence organisation. He also alluded to a need to take a ride around the park in his chauffeur-driven car with the Attorney-General to ensure security of their conversations – rather than having &#x27;security&#x27; listen in

==Post-Lord Chancellorship==

===Northern Ireland Interrogation methods Minority Report===
Lord Gardiner published the &quot;Minority Report&quot; in March 1972 as part of the Parker Report (&quot;Report of the Committee of Privy Counsellors appointed to consider authorised procedures for the interrogation of persons suspected of terrorism&quot;), which considered the interrogation procedures used against suspects of terrorism in Northern Ireland, with particular reference to allegations of torture during internment in 1971 (See Sensory deprivation, Use of torture since 1948#United Kingdom, Five techniques). Lord Gardiner was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1975 New Year&#x27;s Honours.

===Assassination attempt===
In June 1981 Gardiner survived an assassination attempt when a bomb containing 3 pounds of explosive was attached to his car by the IRA during a visit to Belfast. The device was later found near the junction of University Road and Elmwood Avenue, Belfast, and defused by the British Army. The IRA released a statement saying: &quot;We meant to kill Gardiner, the political architect of the criminalization policy and the H-blocks. The device fell off the car and failed to explode.&quot;

===Open University===
He was Chancellor of the Open University from 1973 to 1978.

==Personal life==
In 1925, Gardiner married Lesly Trounson; they had one daughter, and were married until his wife&#x27;s death in 1966. In 1970, Gardiner married Muriel Box, a writer, producer and director who had won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;The Seventh Veil&quot;. She published his biography in 1983. 

Gardiner died at his home in Mill Hill, London, on 7 January 1990, at the age of 89.

<text>Meridian Lossless Packing, also known as Packed PCM (PPCM), is a lossless compression technique for PCM audio data developed by Meridian Audio, Ltd. MLP is the standard lossless compression method for DVD-Audio content (often advertised with the Advanced Resolution logo) and typically provides about 1.5:1 compression on most music material. All DVD-Audio players are equipped with MLP decoding, while its use on the discs themselves is at their producers&#x27; discretion.

Dolby TrueHD, used in Archival Disc Blu-ray and HD DVD, employs the MLP codec, but compared with DVD-Audio, adds higher bit rates, 32 full-range channels, extensive metadata, and custom speaker placements (as specified by SMPTE).

Standard DVD has a maximum transfer rate of 9.6 Mbit/s, around 70 percent of the bit rate needed to store 6 &quot;uncompressed&quot; audio channels of 24-bit/96 kHz. Should MLP not be able to compress the stream below the maximum transfer rate – or in case there is a need to reduce the size to fit overall disc capacity – it can exploit (lossy) pre-quantification zeroing out least significant bits when necessary. The MLP stream can also contain &quot;substreams&quot;, like surround and stereo downmix, which need not be of the same bit depth or sampling frequency – this further enables (lossy) pre-processing to save space. TrueHD streams cannot do this (likely because Blu-Ray discs have higher storage capacity).

MLP is &quot;streamable&quot;: A decoder can pick up the stream and start decoding from that point on nearly instantly, where the encoder has inserted a &quot;restart block&quot; in the stream. Typically, restart information is inserted approximately every 5 ms in the audio, about the same as a typical 96 kHz FLAC stream.

<doc id="438911" wikidata="Q725851" url="?curid=438911" title="Scotty 2 Hotty">
<text>Scott Ronald Garland (born July 2, 1973) is an American professional wrestler signed to All Elite Wrestling as a producer and coach. He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWE) under the ring names &quot;Too Hot&quot; Scott Taylor (1991–1999) and Scotty 2 Hotty (1999–2007). During his WWE career, Garland held the WWF World Tag Team Championship, WWE Tag Team Championship and WWF Light Heavyweight Championship.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1989–1997)===
At approximately 14 or 15 years old, Garland wrote to Sue Aitchison, the Community Relations Specialist of the World Wrestling Federation, inquiring from which professional wrestling school the company recruited the majority of their employees. Aitchison responded by telling him that they did not recruit from any particular school and wished him luck. Garland then attempted to call Vince McMahon, but was unable to speak to McMahon directly.

Garland began attending shows at the Cumberland County Civic Center in Portland, Maine, helping the ring crew to construct the wrestling ring. After an independent promoter saw Garland wrestling with his friends, he offered Garland a job. In his first match, Garland wrestled Steve Ramsey in a Portland armory on November 23, 1989, the same night the Survivor Series was taking place. In the same year, Garland began wrestling for the Massachusetts-based New England Wrestling.

In August 1991, Garland was introduced to the WWF by fellow NEW wrestler Phil Apollo. Garland made his first appearance with the World Wrestling Federation in October 1991 while still a junior in high school, teaming with Sonny Blaze and using the ring name &quot;Scott Taylor&quot;. Garland appeared sporadically with the WWF as an enhancement talent over the next six years, losing to wrestlers such as The Berzerker, Yokozuna and The Ringmaster.

Garland continued to attend college throughout his early tenure, and in 1994, he supplemented his income by working as a Fleet Bank bank teller and as the assistant manager of a Spencer&#x27;s Gifts outlet.

Garland made two appearances for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in February 1997, losing both matches to Taz.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (1997–2021)===

====Light heavyweight division (1997–1998)====
In 1997, Garland, now working for insurance company Unum, planned to wrestle tryout matches for Extreme Championship Wrestling. Upon hearing of his plans, President of the WWF Talent Relations Bruce Prichard signed him to a contract. Garland began wrestling in the Light Heavyweight division as Scott Taylor. In late 1997, he took part in an eight-man tournament for the vacant WWF Light Heavyweight Championship, but was eliminated in the second round after being chokeslammed by Kane.

====Too Much/Too Cool (1998–2001)====
On March 29, 1998 at WrestleMania XIV, Taylor and &quot;Too Sexy&quot; Brian Christopher teamed together for the first time, taking part in a tag team battle royal. Following WrestleMania XIV, Taylor and Christopher continued to team together on the WWF&#x27;s syndicated Saturday wrestling shows, with Taylor playing the straight man to Christopher&#x27;s over-the-top, egotistical antics. Soon, Taylor adopted Christopher&#x27;s flamboyant actions and in-ring mannerisms and became known as Scott &quot;Too Hot&quot; Taylor, with the duo dubbed &quot;Too Much&quot;. In June 1999, they were renamed &quot;Too Cool&quot; and given the characteristics of hip hop aficionados.

Shortly after debuting their new gimmicks, the team was temporarily separated after Christopher tore his anterior cruciate ligament and was sidelined for five months. During this time, Taylor began incorporating breakdancing moves into his matches. In late 1999, Taylor was renamed Scotty 2 Hotty and Christopher was renamed Grandmaster Sexay. They aligned themselves with Rikishi Fatu (whom they quickly renamed Rikishi), forming a faction. Following their matches, they would dance in the center of the ring.

In early 2000, the group began feuding with The Radicalz, culminating with Too Cool teaming with Chyna to defeat Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn and Dean Malenko at WrestleMania 2000. After Grandmaster re-injured his leg, Scotty briefly returned to the Light Heavyweight division, and on April 17, 2000, he defeated Radicalz member Dean Malenko to win the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship. He held the title for only 10 days before dropping it back to Malenko on April 27, 2000. Scotty challenged Malenko for the title once more at Backlash, but was defeated. Grandmaster returned in mid-2000, and on May 29, Too Cool defeated Edge and Christian for the WWF World Tag Team Championship with the assistance of rapper Joe C. They held the title until King of the Ring, when Edge and Christian regained the title.

Too Cool and Rikishi separated in late 2000 after Rikishi was revealed to have run over Stone Cold Steve Austin. Rikishi subsequently easily defeated his former allies in a handicap match. In March 2001, the intervertebral disc between Scotty&#x27;s C5, and C6, C7 vertebrae bulged, and he was forced to take time off and do physical therapy 5 days a week. His absence was explained that he suffered a (kayfabe) broken ankle at the hands of Kurt Angle. While Scotty was recuperating, Grandmaster was released from the company for illegally conveying drugs across the Canada–United States border.

====Various tag teams (2001–2007)====
Scotty returned to the ring in June 2001, taking part in the rivalry between Team WWF and The Alliance. During this time, he formed a tag team with Albert, who subsequently adopted the nickname &quot;The Hip Hop Hippo&quot;, and they collectively became known as the &quot;Zoo Crew&quot;. The team competed in the tag team division until April 2002, when Albert betrayed Scotty by attacking him. Soon thereafter, Scotty began experiencing pains in his previously injured neck, and on May 7, 2002, Dr. Lloyd Youngblood performed neck surgery (cervical fusion) on him.

Scotty spent 18 months recuperating, returning to the ring on television in October 2003. Wrestling on the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; brand, Scotty formed a tag team with his former ally Rikishi. Together, they competed in the tag team division and ultimately defeated the Basham Brothers to win the WWE Tag Team Championship on February 5, 2004. Scotty and Rikishi successfully defended their titles in a four-way tag team match at WrestleMania XX. Their reign ended on April 22, 2004 when they were defeated by Charlie Haas and Rico. On July 16, 2004, WWE released Rikishi, leaving Scotty on his own.

After Rikishi&#x27;s release, Scotty wrestled mainly on &quot;Velocity&quot; and in dark matches until early 2007. He also teamed with Funaki from 2005 to 2006. In late 2004, Scotty had a scare of testicular cancer, but he quickly recovered and was back wrestling within a couple of months. In February 2007 he returned briefly to the &quot;Raw&quot; roster, competing in a handful of matches on &quot;WWE Heat&quot;. Before this, he was the last person drafted in 2002 to remain on his original show. He was released from the company on May 18, 2007.

====Sporadic appearances, NXT Trainer (2007–2021)====
Seven months after his release, on the December 10, 2007 15-Year Anniversary special episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Scotty would take part in a &quot;15-Year Flashback Battle Royal&quot;, lasting to the final four before being eliminated by Skinner. On the August 15, 2012 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, Scotty would make a surprise appearance, defeating Heath Slater. On the January 6, 2014 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Scotty would reunite with Grand Master Sexay and Rikishi, defeating 3MB (Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre and Jinder Mahal) in a six-man tag team match. On February 24, at NXT Arrival, Scotty would team with Sexay, challenging The Ascension for the NXT Tag Team Championship in a losing effort.

On September 7, 2016, Garland made his return to WWE as a trainer at the WWE Performance Center. According to &quot;Pro Wrestling Torch&quot; in 2017, Garland taught the middle class at the WWE Performance Center, the second of four levels of classes. He would stay with WWE until November 23, 2021, when Garland reportedly asked for his release from the company.

===Independent circuit (2007–2016, 2022–present)===

After leaving WWE, Garland worked two shows for Puerto Rico&#x27;s International Wrestling Association (IWA) in mid-June 2007. He then wrestled on the independent circuit, working for at least 31 promotions in 11 countries as Scotty 2 Hotty and Scotty the Hotty. In 2014 and 2015 Garland continued teaming with Grand Master Sexay in the independents, England and Germany. On December 6, 2014, Garland, as Scotty 2 Hotty, made his debut for the Japanese Pro Wrestling Noah promotion, teaming with Funaki and Super Crazy in a six-man tag team match, where they defeated Pesadilla, Yoshinari Ogawa and Zack Sabre Jr., with Scotty pinning Pesadilla for the win. He would retire from wrestling in 2016, when he was hired by WWE as a coach for their development territory NXT.

On New Year’s Day 2022, he made his return to independent wrestling for the first time since 2016 for Game Changer Wrestling’s Die For This pay-per-view where he lost to Joey Janela. Recently he has trained wrestlers and wrestled matches in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway.

===All Elite Wrestling (2023–present)===
Garland made his All Elite Wrestling debut competing in a dark match on the December 27, 2023 episode &quot;Dynamite&quot;, teaming with Billy Gunn and The Acclaimed in an 8-man tag team match, defeating Jake Hager, Matt Menard and The Gunns. On January 11, 2024, Garland revealed on the &quot;AEW Unrestricted&quot; podcast that he was signed to the company as a producer and coach.

==Firefighting career==
In February 2013, Garland began training as a firefighter. In June 2013, he graduated from the Lake Tech Fire Academy in Florida. He subsequently began training as an emergency medical technician.

==Personal life==
Garland lives in the Orlando, Florida area with his two children. Garland is a fan of Disney (Mick Foley has called him a &quot;Disney psychotic&quot;), and has been to Disneyland and Walt Disney World many times. He bought a Dumbo Halloween costume, among much other merchandise, for his daughter, Taylor before she was even born.

==Other media==
Garland appeared in-character, alongside Kid Kash in the December 2009 video for the Irish band Fight Like Apes&#x27; single &quot;Do You Karate&quot;. In 2010, he completed filming a movie called &quot;Ultimate Death Match 3&quot;, which also featured other wrestlers. In 2017, the American music group Migos paid homage to Garland&#x27;s WWE character with their song titled &quot;Too Hotty&quot;.

==Physics==
* November 17 – George Biddell Airy presents his discovery that astronomical aberration is independent of the local medium.
* James Clerk Maxwell makes public the thought experiment which will become known as Maxwell&#x27;s demon in the philosophy of thermal and statistical physics, in his book &quot;Theory of Heat&quot; and establishes Maxwell relations, statements of equality among the second derivatives of the thermodynamic potentials with respect to different thermodynamic variables.
* John Strutt publishes his first papers on the theory of acoustic resonance and on the phenomenon now called Rayleigh scattering, explaining why the sky is blue.

==Physiology and medicine==
* Porphyria is first explained biochemically by Felix Hoppe-Seyler.
* Friedrich Trendelenburg describes the first successful elective human tracheotomy to be performed for the purpose of administering general anaesthesia.
* Friedrich Miescher publishes his 1869 isolation of what will subsequently be called nucleic acid.

==Technology==
* Institution of Electrical Engineers established in the United Kingdom as the Society of Telegraph Engineers.
* Souter Lighthouse in England is the first to use alternating current electricity.
* Ralph Hart Tweddell invents the portable hydraulic riveter, manufactured by Fielding &amp; Platt of Gloucester in England.
* The &quot;Hoe web perfecting press&quot;, an improved rotary printing press invented by Richard March Hoe, is first used to print the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;.
* Montague Redgrave is granted U.S. Patent #115,357 for his &quot;Improvements in Bagatelle&quot;, the basis of the spring-loaded plunger used in pinball machines.

==Publications==
* &quot;Cosmos: A Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe&quot; by Alexander von Humboldt, covering a large number of topics in scientific exploration and invention.
* &quot;The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot; by Charles Darwin, outlining his theory for man&#x27;s origins and his theory of sexual selection, and including his first published use of the term &quot;evolution&quot; (published by John Murray in London, February 24).

<text>The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad (G&amp;CU) was the first railroad constructed out of Chicago, intended to provide a shipping route between Chicago and the lead mines near Galena, Illinois. The railroad company was chartered on January 16, 1836, but financial difficulties delayed construction until 1848. While the main line never reached Galena, construction to Freeport, Illinois, allowed it to connect with the Illinois Central Railroad, thus providing an indirect route to Galena. A later route went to Clinton, Iowa.

==History==
===Contexts===
After the Erie Canal was completed in 1825, immigrants flooded into the Midwest from the East. Chicago&#x27;s location, at the southwestern end of Lake Michigan with a short, easy portage to rivers flowing south and west, made it a strategic point for white settlers moving through—as it had been for Native peoples before them. The white population in the region expanded exponentially, creating both markets and products that would need transportation.

One particular market that had Chicago leaders&#x27; attention was centered in Galena, Illinois, a town named for the most common form of lead sulphide. Long mined by Native peoples and French explorers, substantial lead deposits in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa became known to settlers from the East in the early 1800s. St. Louis had a monopoly on shipping lead from Galena down the Mississippi River by steamboat to link to markets on the East Coast. But merchants and miners in Galena wanted a quicker, more direct route to Lake Michigan.

The Illinois and Michigan Canal was chartered on February 13, 1835, to provide a water route from Lake Michigan to the Illinois River and then to the Mississippi. However, work on the canal didn&#x27;t officially begin until 1836, and various issues delayed construction, so the canal wasn&#x27;t completed and operable until April 1848. Once completed, the canal did in fact carry significant amounts of cargo, as its successor the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal still does.

But merchants in Galena thought a railroad would provide lower costs to transport goods more directly to and from Chicago, then on to the East Coast. Historian Patrick E. McLear notes that boosters on the North Side of Chicago—including the railroad&#x27;s future president, William Butler Ogden—also favored a railroad line coming into the city from the north, which they believed would help balance trade patterns that had so far favored areas south of the Chicago River.

And so the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad was chartered on January 16, 1836, initially capitalized at one thousand shares of $100 each, for a total of $100,000. The first stockholders&#x27; meeting took place on May 23, 1836, at which a board of directors was elected; on July 3, 1836, the board elected Theophilus W. Smith as president.

===Looming financial failure===
The G&amp;CU was one of seventeen railroads incorporated in that legislative session, seven of which failed within two years. New railroad companies were risky ventures, because they had to spend huge amounts on construction, rolling stock, and storage and maintenance facilities before they could even begin to make money. While communities in the Midwest wanted railroads, the population simply wasn&#x27;t great enough to fund and support railroad services. Knowing this, the G&amp;CU&#x27;s commissioners initially sought financing from investors in the East, and on August 4, 1836, they increased the amount of stock for sale to $500,000, aware that building a railroad would cost much more than $100,000.

However, the Panic of 1837 played havoc with fundraising of any sort. Few people had money to invest in a railroad, and several Directors of the company had to resign as they themselves were engulfed in financial problems. Though the Board did commission a survey of the route from downtown Chicago to the Des Plaines River, they could do nothing further.

Things seemed about to change when Elijah K. Hubbard got involved, purchasing an overwhelming majority of G&amp;CU stock—79 percent, in fact; he also provided $30,000 for construction costs, so the railroad had funds to work with until late 1838. However, Hubbard died in May 1839 of tuberculosis, at which point it was revealed that he had been silently representing Elihu Townsend, an Eastern financier who was a director of the New York and Erie Railroad. To show Townsend that things were moving, William B. Ogden worked with developer Walter L. Newberry to plot a general route for the railroad to Galena, and several towns along the route held public meetings to demonstrate support for continuing construction. But Townsend was not convinced, offered no further support, and did nothing with his shares.

Everything came to a halt. Construction was not resumed. After their final meeting on November 22, 1837, the Directors of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad did not meet for years. The G&amp;CU was no longer a functioning company.

===William B. Ogden and new life for the G&amp;CU===

William B. Ogden led the movement to reinvigorate the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad. When the G&amp;CU was first chartered, Ogden had been in Chicago for less than a year, overseeing his wealthy brother-in-law&#x27;s land investments north of the Chicago River. He had already worked to support railroad development as a young legislator in the state of New York, taking the lead in March 1835 to argue for state support of the New York and Erie Railroad. He asked fellow legislators to help build &quot;continuous railways from New York to Lake Erie . . . through Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, to the waters of the Mississippi,&quot; creating &quot;the most splendid system of internal communication ever yet devised by man.&quot; The legislation passed, and his work was seen as a resounding success.

More interested in business than politics, however, two months later Ogden agreed to become the Chicago director of the American Land Company, arriving in May 1835. Although he himself was not wealthy, through his New York connections he had the trust of many rich investors. After two years in Chicago, Ogden was handling financial affairs for about a hundred Eastern investors, working with running totals, on average, of about $1 million of their funds. As his clients&#x27; profits grew, so did his own fortune. He was a savvy businessperson, well liked in Chicago, and he seems to have been a natural leader. In 1837 he was elected the first Mayor of Chicago, and in subsequent years he &quot;was a leader in nearly every Chicago institution and investment enterprise in the 1840s and 1850s.&quot;

As he had been in New York, Ogden was particularly interested in building transportation networks. He invested in—and became president of—a steamboat company that operated for two years, linking Chicago with the western terminus of the Michigan Central Railroad at St. Joseph, Michigan. He and a partner got the contract to dig the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which they eventually completed a few years after the Panic of 1837 had calmed down. Although both ventures strained him financially, he successfully avoided bankruptcy, and when the economy settled down he focused on reviving the moribund Galena and Chicago Union Railroad.

As the years had gone on with no railroad service, frustrated mine operators in Wisconsin had begun to use wagon companies to transport lead to Madison and then on to Milwaukee. Newspapers in Milwaukee documented the exponentially increasing shipments of lead, taunting Chicagoans that this trade suggested &quot;Milwaukee is destined to be the greatest town on Lake Michigan.&quot; As time went on, more towns in northwestern Illinois demanded action, to the point where supporters from Chicago realized that they might also lose the Galena market to the Madison-Milwaukee wagon companies.

Ogden and his associates began planning. In 1845, a group of businessmen from Galena, Rockford, and Chicago met in Rockford to organize a convention of interested parties from along the G&amp;CU route. The convention began in Rockford on January 7, 1846 and was attended by Charles S. Hempstead who had just finished his term as Galena&#x27;s first mayor. According to D. W. Yungmeyer, &quot;the Chicago group was so well organized that it practically took over all the official chairs, committee heads, and about everything else, and because of its readiness with resolutions, statistics, and so on, secured the whole-hearted consent and approval of .–. everything [they] proposed.&quot; Delegates voted to create an organization that would take on the task of resurrecting the Galena and Chicago Union, appointing a committee which included eight Chicago representatives as well as former Galena mayor Hempstead.

William Ogden did not attend because he was in New York meeting with Elihu Townsend. With Ogden&#x27;s eastern connections and his support of the New York and Erie Railroad—of which Townsend was a director—Ogden was in a good position to negotiate with Townsend. According to the original 1836 charter, if the G&amp;CU company did not build a railroad within ten years, it would be disbanded as a corporation, and Townsend would lose everything he had invested. An amendment to the charter in 1837 had extended the construction deadline by five years, so they were still within the 15-year construction period, but it wasn&#x27;t clear that Townsend planned to do anything on his own. If he were to let the new, still unofficial, group take over, Townsend could expect a profit if they were successful. Ogden set up the outlines of a deal in which Townsend would relinquish corporate control of the G&amp;CU in exchange for the promise of substantial amounts of stock in what would essentially be a new company governed by the same charter.

When Ogden returned from New York with the promise of control over the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad Company, the new board of directors elected him as company president, on February 17, 1846. With the new organization, the deal with Townsend was completed in December 1846. A year after the first directors&#x27; meeting, on February 24, 1847, the Illinois legislature amended the railroad&#x27;s charter to fit the new circumstances, setting the company&#x27;s capital at $3 million. The Galena and Chicago Union was back in business.

==Construction==
===Building capital===
Though newly reorganized, the G&amp;CU company still needed cash to begin building. In 1847, Richard Morgan, their civil engineer, estimated construction costs of a single-track line from Chicago to Galena at approximately $2.65 million, or $14,553 for each mile. The directors took a two-pronged approach to get this funded: they urged local farmers and townspeople to buy small amounts of stock in the railroad, and they sought other wealthy investors in the East. Neither approach worked well: local stock purchases were disappointing, and the Eastern financiers were dismissive, even rude. Shipping magnate William F. Weld told the G&amp;CU representatives, &quot;When it breaks down as it surely will ... come and give it to us, and we will take hold of it and complete it.&quot;

Ogden and the Directors adjusted their strategy in two ways. They decided to begin construction as they gained funding, even if they didn&#x27;t yet have money to build the whole route, and they intensified their efforts to sell stock in Illinois. One approach was to target farmers: as Morgan had written in his construction report, &quot;a farmer near Rock River expends as much [money] getting his wheat to market as all other expenses of ploughing, sowing, harvesting and threshing,&quot; adding that the railroad would reduce their costs by $150 annually. Ogden in particular traveled the length of the planned route, trying to sell stock to farmers, businessmen, and miners in both Illinois and Wisconsin; he emphasized that downpayment on a $100 share would only cost $2.50, and that investors could make partial payments over time to complete the purchase. Two other company directors, J. Young Scammon and Walter Newberry, approached tired farmers who had just driven their harvest loads into Chicago, pointing out that a railroad would save them that work.

By the time of the first annual meeting of the new G&amp;CU&#x27;s stockholders, on April 5, 1848, slightly over $350,000 worth of stock had been sold, but downpayments on the stock amounted only to $20,817. Still, the board decided this was enough to pay for construction of the first segment from Chicago to Elgin. It helped that the terrain was flat, making construction simpler and cheaper. New chief engineer John Van Nortwick planned to save money by using strap-iron rails—wooden rails topped by 3/4-inch-thick iron strips—which were commonly used among early railroads. That spring, Ogden and fellow director Raymond Turner went east to buy construction materials and rolling stock, including locomotives, cars, and iron for the tracks. Although they had to use stock instead of cash for some of these purchases, they could get what they needed.

Construction began that summer, 1848, with the first four miles of track laid in October and November, reaching what is now Oak Park. To show off the new railroad&#x27;s potential, the company held a celebratory first trip from Kinzie Street to Oak Park for stockholders and journalists, which raised people&#x27;s excitement. Construction was completed to Elgin on January 22, 1850, but even before then the railroad had been hauling freight and passengers for profit. In its first year of official operation, the Galena and Chicago Union earned over $45,000, proving its feasibility. Its success encouraged stockholders and investors, so that funding was never again a problem. On February 26, 1850, the company paid its first dividend to stockholders, an increase of ten percent paid in further stock.

===Building the G&amp;CU===
To support their construction work, the G&amp;CU used the same locomotive that had pulled the celebratory train, an 11-year-old engine purchased in 1848 from the Michigan Central Railroad. A 4-2-0 Baldwin locomotive, it was refurbished and given the new name of &quot;Pioneer&quot;. This little engine, the first to operate in Chicago, was to become a symbol of the company, and later the Chicago and North Western Railway, carrying construction materials back and forth as well as passengers and freight. For a time it was leased to the recently completed Aurora Branch Railroad, which had a close working relationship with the G&amp;CU, but the Pioneer stayed in the G&amp;CU&#x27;s fleet for years and was used extensively to support further construction of the line westward.

In 1849 the company ordered a new engine with four driving wheels from Norris Brothers in Philadelphia, and they planned to order another similar locomotive. Their inventory included 25 freight cars of various types, with more on the way. That year the G&amp;CU also built a freight station in Chicago, where they located the company&#x27;s administrative headquarters, as well as two repair shops and an engine house. They had built a wharf on the Chicago River&#x27;s north branch, but they had to make the river&#x27;s channel wider before they could use it. Other facilities had been constructed at West Chicago and Elgin.

Tracks were completed from Chicago to Elgin on January 22, 1850. Construction reached Cherry Valley on March 10, 1852, and the stretch to Rockford was completed on August 10, 1852. By that point the board had also decided to replace the strap-iron rails first used on the earlier segments with better-quality &quot;T-shaped&quot; steel rails, even though the strap-iron had only been in place for two years. The road from Elgin westwards had been laid with the &quot;T&quot; rails, despite the added cost of $130,000, because they were safer and longer-lasting, and the company wanted to ensure the quality of rails along the whole route.

In May 1849, the Directors issued a resolution reaffirming that their western terminus would be Galena. However, in 1851 the board learned that there were just two viable routes through western Illinois&#x27;s hilly terrain in to Galena, and the Illinois Central Railroad (IC) had priority to choose which one they would use. As a result, rather than build a redundant parallel line, the Board considered linking up with the IC at Freeport, approximately 50 miles east of Galena, then using the Illinois Central&#x27;s tracks in to Galena. An agreement with the Illinois Central to do so was completed by May 1, 1852. Freeport was on the planned route, so when construction to that point was completed on September 1, 1853, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad had accomplished the goal identified in its company name. This agreement also benefited the Illinois Central, in that they would be allowed to use the G&amp;CU&#x27;s depot in Chicago.

==Looking at Iowa and the Missouri River==
A number of railroads were building westward toward the Mississippi River. The Galena &amp; Chicago Union Railroad was one of these working its way from Chicago to the Mississippi on the Fulton Illinois side of the river opposite Clinton Iowa. Recently the new town of Clinton had been renamed by the Iowa Land Co. from its original name of New York, a small village and ferry at a narrows on the river. The businessmen that created the town also created the Chicago Iowa &amp; Nebraska railroad and to ensure they could demand the highest real estate prices, they also created the Albany Bridge Co. to connect Clinton with Fulton and Chicago across the river building a railroad bridge and steam ferry there.

The Iowa railroads at Clinton were the Chicago, Iowa &amp; Nebraska (CI&amp;N) and the Cedar Rapids &amp; Missouri River (CR&amp;MR). The CI&amp;N began laying rail to Cedar Rapids in 1857 while the CR&amp;MR was organized in 1859 to build the rest of the way to Council Bluffs. The CI&amp;N bridge from Fulton to Little Rock Island on the Illinois side of the river included a steam ferry operation to get trains the rest of the way across the river. Now, except for a pending lawsuit by riverboat companies against railroad bridges obstructing navigation, they could begin building the rest of the bridge as well as more miles of Road.

Much of this was designed for gaining government land grants and charters and these companies had many of the same stockholders, including noted New York railroad promoters Dr. Thomas Clark Durant and John Insley Blair. Durant of the Union Pacific had recently committed to building a transcontinental railroad to the west coast from Omaha opposite Council Bluffs in Iowa. Blair&#x27;s CR&amp;MR planned to connect to Omaha via Council Bluffs. The Galena Directors saw the opportunity to connect with the First Transcontinental railroad if they could get control of the Iowa railroads at Clinton.

Three railroad engineer friends from Northfield Vt. were recruited to help out. Dr. Edward H. Williams became Supt. of the Galena and his friend John C. Gault of the Vermont Central was his assistant. Isaac B. Howe, Road Master and Engineer of the Vermont Central was recruited for the Iowa roads in Clinton. Major Charles Bodfish was the railroad Supt. in Clinton with Col. Milo Smith as his Chief Engineer. Previously Milo Smith had done engineering with the G&amp;CU but since 1855 he had been alternately Supt. and Chief Engineer building the CI&amp;N railroad from Clinton to Cedar Rapids plus beginning the Mississippi bridge. When IB Howe took over as Asst. Supt. and Engineer, Milo Smith stepped away to lead the 26th Iowa Infantry Regiment to war.

On the east side of the Mississippi the Galena &amp; Chicago Union Railroad was preparing to expand across the Mississippi into Iowa. From there they had plans for crossing Iowa to Council Bluffs connecting with &#x27;Doc&#x27; Durant&#x27;s transcontinental railroad across the country. In order to accomplish this they would need to acquire the roads already built, and by an interesting coincidence Dr. Williams and Gault were already running the Galena railroad and Howe was by now running both Iowa lines in Clinton. On 23Jun1861 Howe wrote:

&quot;I shall not be surprised if the Road is leased to Galena &amp; Chicago Union RR as they want it &amp; need it very much.&quot;
The following year the Galena notified the CI&amp;N. and CR&amp;MR railroads that they were being leased to the Galena by official published proclamation.

By the end of 1862 a letter was published to other railroads by I.B. Howe, now Superintendent of the Iowa railroads in Clinton:

 &quot;Dear Sir: Please send Annual Passes for 1863, for
 John Bertram, President Horace Williams, General Agent C I &amp; N RR
 L.B. Crocker, President W.W. Walker, Chief Eng&#x27;r
 I.B. Howe, Sup&#x27;t CR &amp; MR RR
 The Roads above-named now form a part of the Galena &amp; Chicago Union Railroad Line, and the Passes you will receive from that company will be good over these roads.
 Respectfully Yours, I.B. Howe, Sup&#x27;t

Other than the fact that WW Walker was Blair&#x27;s civil engineer and Blair was a Director, the Galena had control of the Clinton Iowa railroads with Howe, Gault and Williams running the show. 
But the &quot;war of the rebellion&quot; slowed progress as resources were being devoted to the war effort. It was pretty obvious to the nation that the Roads would be in a race across the country were it not for the war. The Iowa Roads were already to Marshalltown by March 1862 and continuing to build further west.
The 1862 map by G. Woolworth Colton shown here lays out the various lines in operation at that time.

Building railroads was a lucrative business where government would grant vast tracts of land to incentivize railroads because where the roads went so went prosperity. But it became complicated when charters went to a road that went bankrupt or bought out another reducing competition, or increasing competition if it wasn&#x27;t well planned. The lease of the Iowa railroads to the Galena company was a stellar example of increasing efficiency, but consolidation so far was only a temporary fix.

==The 1864 Great Consolidation of the Chicago &amp; NorthWestern Railway==

As Howe&#x27;s Iowa roads continued to slowly build westward, the war came to an end. In June 1864 a massive change took place. A previously insignificant Chicago &amp; Northwestern railroad purchased the whole enterprise making it one organization with multiple divisions. This was called The Great Consolidation and the Galena &amp; Chicago Union name disappeared in history. IB Howe became the Supt. of the Iowa Division which included everything from Clinton to the town of Nevada at that time. The Illinois side of the river became the Galena Division with Dr. Williams as Supt. and Gault as his assistant. George L Dunlap, formerly Asst. Supt. of the Chicago, St Anthony &amp; Fond du Lac RR, was now the Gen. Supt. for the entire consolidated railroad. The Nevada railhead was already west of Marshalltown, but by the end of the year they would have pushed the Road past Ames to Boone. The race to Council Bluffs on the Missouri River was on.

This new consolidated railroad completed a connection without transfer from Chicago to Council Bluffs and Omaha in early 1867.

This was the first railroad to reach Council Bluffs, Iowa and connect with the First transcontinental railroad which was being constructed westward by the Union Pacific Railroad in Omaha, Nebraska.

The C&amp;NW merged with the Union Pacific Railroad over a century later in 1996.

Today, the G&amp;CU&#x27;s main line between Chicago and West Chicago is a busy commuter service, jointly operated by Union Pacific and Metra as the Union Pacific / West Line. The remainder of the line from West Chicago to Rockford is still in service carrying only freight (though Amtrak service to Rockford has been proposed and planned) with local industrial spurs in Rockford and Loves Park. The route between Rockford and Freeport is abandoned, and is being converted into a rail trail.

<text>Azazil (Arabic: عزازيل &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot;, ; also known as Arabic: حارث &quot;Ḥārith&quot;) is a figure in Islamic tradition, and believed to be the original name of Satan (&quot;Iblīs&quot;). According to various Islamic beliefs, ʿAzāzīl was the master of the angels and the strongest and most knowledgeable of them, before his pride led to his downfall.

ʿAzāzīl is mentioned in Islamic complementary narratives, such as &quot;tafsīr&quot; (authorized exegesis of the Quran) and Qisas al-Anbiya. According to a &quot;ḥadīth&quot; by ibn Abbas, Satan was once an angel called &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; or &quot;al-Ḥārith&quot;. He states that God created most angels from &quot;light&quot; (&quot;Nūr&quot;), but &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; and the angels with him from &quot;poisonous fire&quot; (&quot;nār as-samūm&quot;). The djinn were created from &quot;a mixture of fire&quot; (&quot;mārijin min nār&quot;).

The djinn were the first to inhabit the world and God entrusted them to govern the earth. When corruption increased among them, God sent an army of angels under the leadership of &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; to punish them. After driving the djinn away, &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; grew arrogant. When God creates a successor to the djinn and commands the angels to prostrate themselves before the new creation, &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; refuses, claiming that he is better. Thereupon, he is condemned to hell.

==Etymology and naming==
The name resembles Azazel, a fallen angel in the Apocalypse of Abraham, and might be its etymological origin. Feinberg argues that the name relates to Arabic &quot;‘azala&quot; (to remove) and is given to this angel because he &quot;removes or separates&quot; by Muslim authors.

Some Islamic philologists construct his name from the words &quot;aziz&quot; and &quot;il&quot; (&quot;God&#x27;s dear&quot;), meaning that his name derived from the meaning that he was once God&#x27;s favorite angel. 

According to many Arabic scholars, &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; was the personal name of Satan (Iblis). Ibn Manzur (June–July 1233 – December 1311/January 1312) writes in his dictionary of the Arabic language:
== Quran and &quot;tafsīr&quot; ==
Quranic tradition can be divided into two camps in regards on the identity of Satan. This dispute roots back to the formative stage of Islam. When Surah al-Kahf states, in reference to Satan, &quot;(...) he was one of the jinni (...)&quot;, the strand of Hasan al-Basri and ibn Abbas differ in meaning. According to al-Basri, angels are infallible. Thus, he argues, Satan could not have been an angel. Instead, the verse is supposed to mean that Satan is one of the jinn, distinct from the angels.

According to ibn Abbas, the term is interpreted as &quot;jinān&quot;, meaning that Satan was &quot;an inhabitant of paradise&quot; (i.e. an angel). At that time, he was appointed by God as the ruler of the lower heavens and sent to judge the djinn, until they became corrupt and was commanded to eliminate them. Ibn Abbas further explains that Satan&#x27;s angelic name was &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot;. However, after &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; was banished from heaven, his name is changed to &quot;Iblīs&quot; and is turned into a &quot;cursed demon&quot; (&quot;shayṭān rajim&quot;).

He is further blamed to claim divine authority for himself by calling for obedience among God&#x27;s creation. Surah al-’Anbiyā (26-29) is understood as a reference to Satan: &quot;And they say, &quot;The Most Merciful has taken a son.&quot; Exalted is He! Rather, they are [but] honored servants. They cannot precede Him in word, and they act by His command. He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they, from fear of Him, are apprehensive. And whoever of them should say, &quot;Indeed, I am a god besides Him&quot; - that one We would recompense with Hell. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.&quot;

Unlike the tradition of al-Basri, ibn Abbas&#x27; interpretation accepts that angels can sin and be expelled from heaven. This interpretation is favored in Sunni tradition by scholars such as Tabari, Suyuti, and Nasafi.

== Wider Islamic tradition ==
Drawing from legends by some Turkish sources, &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; was a unique being, created from fire. He grew up pious and was lifted up to live with the angels in the first heaven. As the ruler of the lower earth, he was sent by God to the djinn communities on earth in order to persuade them to follow the right path. However, most djinn refused to obey and were burned by God&#x27;s fire. &quot;ʿAzāzīl&#x27;s&quot; piety increased and he was bestowed with angelic qualities when he reaches the seventh heaven. However, he loses his previous achievements when refused to prostrate himself before Adam.

&quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; is also mentioned three times in Rumi&#x27;s Masnavi, as a reminder for the Muslim to exercise discipline and humility, since when &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; acted arrogantly, he was abandoned to hell in spite of his former high position:
 Through discipline and humility this heaven has been filled with light, and through discipline the angel became immaculate and holy. By reason of irreverence, the sun was eclipsed, and insolence caused Azazil to be turned back from the door.

Although &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; is considered an angel (&quot;muqarrab&quot;), who was already created when God created the earthly djinn, the &quot;Brethren of Purity&quot; and &quot;Tarikh Khamis&quot; depict &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; as someone who lived among the djinn until he was taken captive by the angels or was elavated to their rank.

== Sufism==
Al-Hallaj (c. 858 – 922) mentions &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; in his &quot;Kitāb al-Tawāsīn&quot;. Here, &quot;ʿAzāzīl&#x27;s&quot; disobedience to refuse God&#x27;s command is described as way to hallow God&#x27;s name. According to him, &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; proved loyalty to God by declining to bow before Adam. Chapter Six is dedicated to the self-defence of &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot;, and in one section Hallaj explains how each of the letters of &quot;ʿAzāzīl&#x27;s&quot; name relate to his personality. Unlike many other Sufi writers, Hallaj rejected that &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; could be restored to God&#x27;s grace, insisting on Satan&#x27;s damnation. He argues that, since &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; originated from fire, fire must be his final destiny.

Al-Jili describes angels (&quot;malāʾikah&quot;) and devils (&quot;shayāṭīn&quot;) as manifestations of God&#x27;s attributes. While the good angels are made from light in order to guide humanity, &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; and his angels are created as reflecting God&#x27;s names of majesty, darkness and misleading. As an angel of single-minded devotion, &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; fails to realize that bowing before Adam in accordance with God&#x27;s command, is equal as bowing to God himself. &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; and his angels were reduced to the principle of evil, when they rejected repentance and justified their persistence by their creation from fire.

Inayat Khan (1882 – 1927), a pioneer of the transmission of Sufism to the West, similarly teaches that &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; is a devil leading astray from the way of God. He states that evil actions performed by people attract the spirit of &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; (or his minions) who in turn leads them further astray into darkness and wrong actions. &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; is the worst tempters, since the fallen angel has the power to lead even saints astray, however, still fails against the prophets.

==Ismailism==
In Umm al-Kitab, an 8th-century Ismaili work, &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; is the first creation of God, the &quot;High King&quot;. God gave him the power of creation, but &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; boasted with his loaned power, claiming divinity for himself, describing himself as another God beside the High King. To prove that &quot;ʿAzāzīl&#x27;s&quot; creation only depends on the power of his own creator, God makes a new creation, opposed by &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot;. Every time, &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; again claims to be like God, he and his fellow angels lose colour, becoming darker and inferior and are thrown into lower celestial spheres until they end up on earth, which is made out of the essence of &quot;ʿAzāzīl&#x27;s&quot; creations. As with the Gnostic Demiurge, &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; traps the life-forces of the heavenly realm and captures them in the material realm.

&quot;Iblīs&quot; enters the scene only later, as a result of the sins of the former heavenly creatures. For that reason, &quot;Iblīs&quot; does not know the world of light and is utterly evil. For this reason, evil is always associated with ignorance.

Umm al-Kitab&#x27;s depiction of &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; might be a reaction to religious dualism. By claiming divinity for himself, but getting rebuked by God and presenting &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; merely as an angel inferior to God, belief in two eternal principles is rejected. In one instance, Ahriman, the Zorastrian creator of evil, appears namely as a later incarnation of &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot;.

== Bektashi Alevism ==
&quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; features as one of the first angels in an Alevi oral tradition, there he is informed by the archangel Cebrail (Gabriel), about their creator. Along with the other archangels, Cebrail leads &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; to a lamp with seven doors. They shall serve here for 1001 days, so the door will open. After the archangels entered the lamp, they saw two lights forming one body. The archangels were commanded to prostrate before the light. All followed the order but &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot;, who refused to prostrate himself, since the light, as something that was created, could not be the creator, so he turned back to the door to stay in the former service of God. This narration explains that &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; stood at God&#x27;s service, but he despised that he saw when the door opened and decided to move into the &quot;Ego World&quot;, causing the later enmity between Satan and humanity.

<doc id="438921" wikidata="Q541078" url="?curid=438921" title="Takanohana Kōji">
<text>is a Japanese former professional sumo wrestler and coach. He was the 65th man in history to reach sumo&#x27;s highest rank of &quot;yokozuna&quot;, and he won 22 tournament championships between 1992 and 2001, the sixth highest total ever. The son of a popular &quot;ōzeki&quot; ranked wrestler from the 1970s, Takanohana&#x27;s rise through the ranks alongside his elder brother Wakanohana and his rivalry with the foreign born &quot;yokozuna&quot; Akebono saw interest in sumo and attendance at tournaments soar during the early 1990s.

Takanohana was the youngest ever to reach the top division at just 17, and he set a number of other age-related records. He had a solid but aggressive style, looking to get a right hand grip on his opponents&#x27; &quot;mawashi&quot; and move them quickly out of the ring. He won over half his bouts by a straightforward &quot;yorikiri&quot;, or force out. In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries, and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30. He became the head coach of Takanohana stable in 2004 and was on the board of directors of the Japan Sumo Association from 2010 until January 2018, when he was removed and demoted in the Sumo Association&#x27;s hierarchy. He resigned from the Sumo Association in September 2018.

==Background==
Takanohana comes from a family with a great sumo history, sometimes called the &quot;Hanada Dynasty.&quot; His uncle Wakanohana Kanji I was a &quot;yokozuna&quot; from 1958 to 1962, and his father Takanohana Kenshi had held the second highest rank of &quot;ōzeki&quot; for a then record 50 tournaments from 1972 to 1981. Upon his retirement his father established the training stable (&quot;heya&quot;) Fujishima stable. The young Kōji Hanada had been practicing sumo since elementary school and won the equivalent of a &quot;yokozuna&quot; title in junior high school. Upon his graduation in 1988 he formally joined his father&#x27;s stable. His elder brother Masaru had been planning to complete high school but dropped out so as not to lag behind his brother.

==Early career==

Takanohana and his brother made their professional debuts together in March 1988, with future rival Akebono also beginning his career in the same month. The two brothers had to move from the family quarters in the stable and join the communal room with all the other new recruits. They were also instructed not to refer to their parents as &quot;father&quot; and &quot;mother&quot; any more but as &quot;oyakata&quot; and &quot;okamisan&quot; (coach and coach&#x27;s wife). Kōji initially wrestled under the name , and it was understood that he would only be allowed to adopt his father&#x27;s &quot;shikona&quot; of Takanohana (meaning &quot;noble flower&quot;) when he reached the rank of &quot;ōzeki&quot;.

Their early career attracted much publicity, with each divisional promotion regarded by the media as part of an inevitable rise to the top ranks. Takahanada&#x27;s progress was rapid and he set numerous age-related records, including the youngest ever &quot;makushita&quot; division tournament champion (16 years 9 months), youngest ever promoted to the second highest &quot;jūryō&quot; division (17 years 3 months), and the youngest ever promoted to the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division (17 years 8 months).

In March 1991, in his fourth top division tournament, Takahanada was runner-up with twelve wins, and became the youngest ever &quot;sanshō&quot; or special prize winner, receiving awards for Fighting Spirit and Technique. In the following tournament in May 1991 he defeated veteran &quot;yokozuna&quot; Chiyonofuji in a match watched by 44 percent of the Japanese population on TV, becoming the youngest ever to defeat a &quot;yokozuna.&quot; Chiyonofuji retired two days afterwards. In January 1992, he became the youngest ever top division tournament champion (19 years 5 months). He was too young to drink the celebratory sake at the after tournament party, and had to make do with oolong tea instead. After his second championship in September 1992, followed by two good scores of 10–5 and 11–4 in the next two tournaments, he was promoted to &quot;ōzeki&quot; in January 1993, the same tournament in which Akebono was elevated to &quot;yokozuna&quot;.

During this period the two brothers created a so-called &quot;Waka-Taka boom&quot; and were credited with restoring sumo&#x27;s popularity, particularly amongst younger audiences. Interest in sumo rose to its highest level since the era of Futabayama in the 1930s, with official tournaments &quot;(honbasho)&quot; selling out of tickets every day. Both Takahanada and his brother became sex symbols.

==Promotion to &quot;yokozuna&quot;==
Now known as , he was also the youngest ever to be promoted to &quot;ōzeki&quot; at 20 years 5 months. With the foreign born Akebono as sumo&#x27;s only &quot;yokozuna&quot;, there was a great weight of expectation on Takanohana to make the next step up. However, his lack of consistency, and Akebono&#x27;s dominance, delayed his promotion to &quot;yokozuna&quot;. He won his third championship in May 1993, but lost a playoff to Akebono in the following tournament in July, and even produced a &quot;make-koshi&quot; or losing record of 7–8 in November. In 1994, a year in which Akebono suffered several injury problems, Takanohana won the January and May tournaments, but was then outshone by Musashimaru, who won in July with a perfect 15–0 record. After taking the September 1994 championship, Takanohana now had six top division titles, but none had been won consecutively. No previous wrestler had ever accumulated so many titles before reaching sumo&#x27;s highest rank. The Sumo Association nominated him for &quot;yokozuna&quot; after the September tournament, but the Yokozuna Deliberation Council failed to endorse it by the required two-thirds majority, the first time this had happened in twenty five years. They insisted that two consecutive championships were required, having demanded the same of Akebono before his promotion. After changing the spelling of his &quot;shikona&quot; in November 1994, Takanohana at last managed to win two consecutive tournaments, with his second consecutive unbeaten 15–0 score, and his promotion was confirmed. He had been at the &quot;ōzeki&quot; rank for 11 tournaments, or nearly two years. However, at 22 years and 3 months, he was still the third youngest &quot;yokozuna&quot; ever at the time.

==&quot;Yokozuna&quot; career==

===1995–1997===
Takanohana&#x27;s total of seven tournament championships by the start of 1995 was the same as the total won by Akebono, who had reached the &quot;yokozuna&quot; rank two years before him. However, Takanohana now pulled ahead of his rival. He was at his peak as a &quot;yokozuna&quot; between 1995 and 1997, during which time he won 11 of the 17 tournaments he entered, finishing runner-up in the other six. He produced two more perfect scores of 15–0, in September 1995 and September 1996. Overall he won 80 out of 90 bouts he fought in 1995, 70 out of 75 in 1996, and 78 out 90 in 1997, far ahead of any other wrestler. In three of the tournaments Takanohana did not win during this period, he was defeated by stablemates in playoffs: once to Wakanohana and twice to &quot;ōzeki&quot; Takanonami. Sumo rules prevent wrestlers from the same &quot;heya&quot; meeting in regular tournament bouts (playoffs excepted) which meant Takanohana avoided not only his brother and Takanonami but also &quot;sekiwake&quot; Akinoshima and Takatōriki. The merger of his father&#x27;s Fujishima stable with his uncle&#x27;s Futagoyama stable in 1993 had added even more top division wrestlers to this list, giving him an advantage over Akebono, who had to face them all. By September 1996 Takanohana had won 15 tournament championships, and was still only 24 years old. However, after sitting out the first tournament of his career in November 1996 due to a back injury suffered on a regional tour, he put on more weight and began to be more susceptible to injury and illness.

===1998–2000===
Takanohana was affected by a liver disorder in the first half of 1998, which caused him to withdraw from the January 1998 tournament and miss the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Nagano (his place was taken by Akebono). He pulled out of the March 1998 tournament as well and was still below his best in May. Shunning the traditional treatment methods available from his stable, he turned instead to a physical therapist called Tashiro Tomita, who had a considerable influence over him. He became increasingly isolated from his father and brother, with his father claiming Takanohana had been &quot;brainwashed&quot; by Tomita. Despite his brother&#x27;s promotion to &quot;yokozuna&quot; that year, creating the first ever sibling grand champions, the two were barely on speaking terms. Takanohana recovered to win the July and September 1998 tournaments, and was runner-up that November. In 1999, however, he was even more badly affected by injuries, including a dislocated shoulder, and managed only one score in double digits all year.

After making peace with his family, Takanohana regained some of his consistency in 2000, although he was temporarily sidelined by an elbow injury suffered in the July tournament. His brother had retired in March, and several other members of his stable were now past their best. With Akebono dominant once more, his best results that year were two runner-up performances.

===2001–2003===
Takanohana won his first tournament in over two years in January 2001, winning his first fourteen bouts and then defeating fellow &quot;yokozuna&quot; Musashimaru in a playoff on the final day. He won his final championship in May 2001, again in a playoff against Musashimaru, but it came at a great cost. He had suffered serious knee ligament damage in a loss to Musōyama on the 14th day but he insisted on fighting until the end of the tournament. As a result, he then missed an unprecedented seven consecutive tournaments, undergoing surgery in Paris in July 2001 and having a lengthy recuperation after that.

Takanohana finally returned to the ring in September 2002, after the Sumo Association declared he must compete or retire. He finished behind Musashimaru on 12–3, the 16th time he had been a tournament runner-up. Considering how long he had been away, it was seen as an impressive comeback. However, he sat out the next tournament with a recurrence of the knee injury. He made another comeback in January 2003, making a late decision to compete. A shoulder injury caused him to miss two days, and after suffering successive losses to Dejima and Aminishiki he announced his retirement. He said he had no regrets and was thankful to have achieved so much in sumo. His father spoke of his relief at the decision, after seeing his son battle through so many injuries. Takanohana&#x27;s record of 22 tournament championships was the fourth best in sumo history, behind only Taihō, Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi at the time. Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister, was among those paying tribute. His retirement left no Japanese born wrestlers at the &quot;yokozuna&quot; rank and was widely regarded as being the end of an era.

Takanohana&#x27;s &quot;danpatsu-shiki&quot;, or official retirement ceremony, was held at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan on June 1, 2003. Unusually, Takanohana allowed only 50 guests on stage to take a snip of his hair, instead of the normal 300 to 400. The ceremony, and the party held afterwards at the Imperial Hotel, were both broadcast live on Fuji TV.

==Fighting style==
Takanohana was largely a &quot;yotsu-sumo&quot; wrestler, favoring techniques which involved grabbing his opponent&#x27;s &quot;mawashi&quot; or belt. His preferred grip was &quot;migi-yotsu&quot; (right hand inside, left hand outside his opponent). His most common winning &quot;kimarite&quot; by far was &quot;yori-kiri&quot;, a simple force out, which accounted for 52 percent of his victories. He also regularly employed &quot;uwatenage&quot;, or overarm throw, and this was the technique he used to defeat Asashōryū in the second of their two meetings, in September 2002.

==Retirement from sumo==

After his retirement he became an elder (or member) of the Japan Sumo Association. Because of his great achievements in sumo he was given a bonus of 130 million yen and was also made a &quot;one generation&quot; elder without having to purchase a share in the Association. This enabled him to keep his fighting name and he was now known as Takanohana Oyakata. With his father&#x27;s health failing, he took over the operation of his training stable in January 2004, renaming it Takanohana stable. Its last &quot;sekitori&quot;, Takanonami retired shortly afterwards. During 2008, he added four new recruits to his stable, the first for several years, bringing the total number of wrestlers in his charge up to ten. These include his first foreign recruit, a Mongolian with amateur sumo experience named Takanoiwa, and two twins. In July 2012 Takanohana produced his first &quot;sekitori&quot; level wrestler when Takanoiwa was promoted to the second highest &quot;jūryō&quot; division. He won the &quot;jūryō&quot; championship in January 2013 and a year later was promoted to the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division. Takanohana also coached Takakeishō, who reached the top division in January 2017.

Takanohana became a judge of tournament bouts in February 2004, only a year after his retirement, a role for which elders normally have to wait at least four years. After the election of the Association&#x27;s Board of Directors in February 2008, the Association appointed Takanohana as , replacing former &quot;yokozuna&quot; Chiyonofuji who was elected to serve the Board as a director. For an organization that tends to follow seniority over achievement in its organization appointment, it was highly unusual for them to place a 35-year-old to such an influential position. However both former &quot;yokozuna&quot;, Kitanoumi and Chiyonofuji whom Takanohana is often compared to, served a stint as Associate Manager of Judging prior to their becoming the Board director. In February 2009 he was moved from the judging department to the &quot;jungyō&quot; (regional tour) department, a less high-profile position.

Takanohana mentioned in October 2009 that he was interested in running for a spot on the Board of Directors in the February 2010 elections, and confirmed in January that he would stand, despite the fact that this would mean opposing the two officially sanctioned candidates of the Nishonoseki &quot;ichimon&quot; or group of stables. As a result, Takanohana and six of his supporters, Ōtake (the former Takatōriki), Futagoyama (the former Dairyū), Otowayama (the former Takanonami), Tokiwayama (the former Takamisugi), Ōnomatsu (the former Masurao), and Magaki (the former Wakanohana II) left the Nishonoseki &quot;ichimon&quot;. Takanohana told a press conference, &quot;I will leave the faction. I bid farewell to everyone in my greetings at the meeting. I have stepped into the race as a candidate.&quot; The first contested elections since 2002, they took place by secret ballot on February 1, and Takanohana was elected to the board, replacing Ōshima. Seen as a reformer, he favored revamping the current ticket sales system and improving support for ex-&quot;rikishi&quot;, as well as encouraging sumo in primary schools, raising the pay of &quot;gyōji&quot;, &quot;yobidashi&quot; and &quot;tokoyama&quot;, and making public the Sumo Association&#x27;s accounts and assets. His victory was praised by the Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who said Takanohana had let in &quot;a new wind of change.&quot; In 2014, the JSA made the decision to recognize the Takanohana group formed from the stables ousted in 2010, as an official &quot;ichimon&quot;.

In July 2010, in the wake of a scandal involving several wrestlers admitting to illegal gambling, he denied he had connections with members of the yakuza underworld after media reports that he was seen with a mobster during a visit to Ehime Prefecture to recruit new apprentices.

Following the election of Hanaregoma as the new head of the Sumo Association in August 2010, Takanohana returned to the judging department as director of judging. At 38 he was the second youngest director of judging in the history of the Sumo Association. The following month he and his wife were awarded ¥8.47 million in damages by the Tokyo High Court over 13 articles published by the &quot;Shukan Gendai&quot; and &quot;Gekkan Gendai&quot; in 2004 and 2005 concerning match-fixing allegations and the controversy over his father&#x27;s inheritance. He left the judging department once again in 2012 and became the director of the Osaka tournament.

Having reached a peak weight of as an active wrestler, he has lost a great deal of weight since his retirement (more than retired wrestlers typically do) and is now around . In 2009 he published a book detailing his weight loss methods.

He ran for the chairmanship of the Sumo Association in 2016, but was defeated by Hakkaku Oyakata (ex-&quot;yokozuna&quot; Hokutoumi). Following this he was replaced as General Enterprises Director, seen as the third highest position in the Association&#x27;s hierarchy, by Kagamiyama Oyakata, and became the &quot;jungyo&quot; (regional tour) director.

===Takanoiwa affair and resignation===
Takanohana was criticized for his delay in notifying the Sumo Association that Takanoiwa would miss the November 2017 tournament because of injuries allegedly sustained in an assault by the &quot;yokozuna&quot; Harumafuji at a restaurant in bar in Tottori Prefecture in late October. Takanohana reported the incident to the police but did not submit a medical certificate for his wrestler until near the start of the tournament. Takanohana refused to speak to the press about the incident or co-operate with the Sumo Association&#x27;s investigation. An editorial in the &quot;Nikkei Asian Review&quot; compared his actions to &quot;an executive withholding from top management information that could rock the company.&quot; Sumo writer Chris Gould said Takanohana was under fire for breaking sumo&#x27;s code of secrecy by going to the police, whereas &quot;in most other sports he&#x27;d be lauded as a whistleblowing hero.&quot; It was announced after a meeting of sumo elders on December 1, 2017 that Takanohana would only talk to the Sumo Association&#x27;s crisis management team once the police investigation was concluded. On December 28 an emergency meeting of the board of directors recommended unanimously to dismiss Takanohana as a director for failing to promptly report Takanoiwa&#x27;s injuries to the Sumo Association, and for failing to co-operate with the investigation. Their recommendation was certified by a meeting of Sumo Association councilors and external members on January 4, with Takanohana demoted two rungs in the hierarchy. It is the first time that a director has been dismissed before the end of his scheduled term. He failed to gain re-election to the board in the February 2018 elections, receiving only two votes in the ballot. The Takanohana group had selected Ōnomatsu Oyakata (the former &quot;sekiwake&quot; Masurao), as their preferred candidate and he was duly elected, but Takanohana decided to run as well. In March 2018 Takanohana was demoted again, to the lowest rank of &quot;toshiyori&quot;, due mainly to the behavior of his wrestler Takayoshitoshi, who was suspended for one tournament for punching his attendant in the dressing room after a match. He returned to the &quot;shimpan&quot; or judging committee.

On September 25, 2018 Takanohana announced his resignation from the Japan Sumo Association, after refusing to disavow the allegations in a letter of complaint that he filed with the Cabinet Office on March 9 over the Association&#x27;s handling of the Takanoiwa affair. Although he withdrew the letter later that month following Takayoshitoshi&#x27;s misbehavior, in August the Association demanded that he disavow what he wrote as &quot;totally false,&quot; but he refused. He also announced that Takanohana stable will be dissolved with its wrestlers transferring to Chiganoura stable. He called his decision &quot;agonizing and gut-wrenching&quot; but said he could not &quot;bend the truth and say that what was in my complaint was untrue.&quot; The JSA in response denied pressuring Takanohana to do this, or to align his stable with an &quot;ichimon&quot;, and spokesman Shibatayama said they had not yet accepted his resignation as Takanohana had not used the correct documents. They accepted Takanohana&#x27;s retirement, and the closure of Takanohana stable, on October 1, 2018. He received 10 million yen for retirement and bonuses, and has been allowed to use the name &quot;Takanohana&quot; outside of the sumo world.

In a press conference on May 19, 2019 Takanohana announced he would be establishing the Takanohana Dojo organization to promote sumo worldwide. He also ruled out any suggestion that he would enter Japanese politics.

==Relationship with family==
The Hanada family had generally received very positive press coverage while Takanohana and Wakanohana were active wrestlers, with the press holding them up as the ideal Japanese family and tending to ignore any splits between them. Their different attitudes towards both sumo philosophy and the outside world had been noted, with Takanohana being regarded as somewhat aloof and reserved and Wakanohana having a warmer personality. However, upon their father&#x27;s death from cancer on May 30, 2005, a bitter rift between the brothers was widely reported in the Japanese media. Takanohana felt he should be the chief mourner at the funeral as he had remained in the Sumo Association whilst his brother had left to become a TV celebrity, but the role went to Wakanohana as the elder brother, as is traditional. However, with their father reported to have left no will, it was suggested that the feud revolved around control of his estate.

Takanohana also condemned his mother for her extramarital affair, which led to her divorce from his father and exit from the stable in July 2001, and had only been rumored up to that point. She has now reverted to her old name of Noriko Fujita and published a book and appeared on TV, revealing details of life as a stablemaster&#x27;s wife that are seldom heard outside the sumo world. Takanohana has rarely spoken to her since. In June 2008 he spoke of his distress at the news that she had been named as a defence witness in a civil lawsuit brought by the Sumo Association against the tabloid magazine &quot;Shūkan Gendai&quot; over allegations that his father benefited from a thrown match for the championship in 1975, saying, &quot;she will essentially be fighting against me.&quot; He said he would take responsibility by resigning from the Sumo Association if she took the stand. In a radio interview Fujita said she would not testify, saying, &quot;I will not drag my child down&quot;.

==Marriage==
In late 1992 Takanohana announced his engagement to actress Rie Miyazawa, news which sparked a similar amount of coverage to the Japanese royal wedding held that year. However the engagement was broken off the following year, reportedly because Miyazawa was seen by Takanohana&#x27;s parents and the Sumo Association as being unwilling to sacrifice her career to become a regular stable wife. The role of the wife of a head coach in looking after the stable&#x27;s recruits and liaising with supporter&#x27;s groups is regarded as a full-time job. In May 1995 Takanohana married television announcer Keiko Kono, eight years older than him. They have a son and two daughters. His son Yuuichi is a shoemaker and radio personality who is married to the daughter of former sumo wrestler Fujinoshin. It was reported in November 2018 that Takanohana and Kono had divorced. 

In September 2023, Takanohana&#x27;s management office confirmed that he had married another woman in August 2023; the new spouse&#x27;s identity was not disclosed.

<text>Anthony Leonard Randall (born Aryeh Leonard Rosenberg; February 26, 1920 – May 17, 2004) was an American actor of film, television and stage. He is best known for portraying the role of Felix Unger in the 1970–75 television adaptation of the 1965 play &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; by Neil Simon. In a career spanning six decades, Randall received six Golden Globe Award nominations and six Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning one Emmy.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Randall was born to a Jewish family in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the son of Julia (née Finston) (April 28, 1889 – October 3, 1950) and Moescha Rosenberg (August 6, 1875 – November 16, 1939), an art and antiques dealer.&lt;ref name=&quot;forward/438563&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Tulsa Central High School.

Randall attended Northwestern University for a year before going to New York City to study at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. He studied under Sanford Meisner and choreographer Martha Graham. Randall worked as an announcer at radio station WTAG in Worcester, Massachusetts. As Anthony Randall, he starred with Jane Cowl in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Candida&quot; and Ethel Barrymore in Emlyn Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot;.

Randall served for five years with the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, including work at Arlington Hall for the codebreaking Signal Intelligence Service. He rose to the rank of first lieutenant prior to his discharge.

After the war, he worked at the Olney Theatre in Montgomery County, Maryland, before heading back to New York City.

One of Randall&#x27;s first acting jobs was as the character Reggie York in the 1949-52 revival of the radio adventure series &quot;I Love a Mystery&quot;.

===Broadway===
In 1946, Randall was cast as one of the brothers in a touring production of Katharine Cornell&#x27;s revival of &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;.

Randall appeared on Broadway in Cornell&#x27;s production of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1947–48) with Cornell, Charlton Heston, and Maureen Stapleton, and in &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1949–50) with Cedric Hardwicke and Lilli Palmer. Randall began appearing on television, notably episodes of &quot;One Man&#x27;s Family&quot;.

===&quot;Mister Peepers&quot;===
Randall&#x27;s first major television role was as history teacher Harvey Weskit in &quot;Mister Peepers&quot; (1952–1955). He continued to guest-star on other shows such as &quot;The Gulf Playhouse&quot; (directed by Arthur Penn), &quot;The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Motorola Television Hour&quot;, &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Appointment with Adventure&quot;, and &quot;The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;.

Randall replaced Gig Young in the Broadway hit &quot;Oh, Men! Oh, Women!&quot; (1954).

===&quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;===
Randall&#x27;s first major role in a Broadway hit was in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1955–57), portraying newspaperman E. K. Hornbeck (based on real-life cynic H. L. Mencken), alongside Ed Begley and Paul Muni. On television he appeared in &quot;Heaven Will Protect the Working Girl&quot; (1956), co-written by Neil Simon. He also guest-starred on &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot;.

===Film star===
Randall&#x27;s success in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; led to film offers and his first significant big-screen role in &quot;Oh, Men! Oh, Women!&quot; (1957) for 20th Century Fox, which promoted Randall to stardom with &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; (1957) alongside Jayne Mansfield. He played one of the leads in &quot;No Down Payment&quot; (1957). He was replaced with Dean Martin shortly before the filming of Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Young Lions&quot;.

In 1958, Randall played the leading role in the Broadway musical comedy &quot;Oh, Captain!&quot;, taking on a role originated on film by Alec Guinness. The show was a financial failure, but Randall received a Tony Award nomination for his dance turn with prima ballerina Alexandra Danilova.

Randall appeared in &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Goodyear Theatre&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Sunday Showcase&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

===Continuing success===
Randall co-starred with Debbie Reynolds in &quot;The Mating Game&quot; (1959) at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He appeared in the hit film &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; (1959) supporting Doris Day and Rock Hudson; he would reunite with Day and Hudson for two more films.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate/2004/05&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Randall starred in an NBC-TV special, &quot;The Secret of Freedom&quot;, which was filmed during the summer of 1959 in Mount Holly, New Jersey, and broadcast on the network during the fall of 1959 and again in early 1960. On TV he was also in &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot; (1960), co-written by Mel Brooks.

Randall was top-billed in &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; from MGM in 1960. He had a &quot;Pillow Talk&quot;-style supporting role in &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot; (1960) with Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand, and &quot;Lover Come Back&quot; (1961) with Hudson and Day. Randall continued to guest on TV shows including &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; and &quot;Checkmate&quot;. In 1961, Randall played a highly dramatic role in &quot;Hangover,&quot; an episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; in which he portrayed an alcoholic advertising executive spiraling into self-destruction. He starred in a TV adaptation of &quot;Arsenic &amp; Old Lace&quot; (1962), and had big-screen leading roles in &quot;Boys&#x27; Night Out&quot; (1962) and &quot;Island of Love&quot; (1963).

In 1964, Randall starred in the classic MGM film, &quot;7 Faces of Dr. Lao&quot;, which was based on &quot;The Circus of Dr. Lao&quot; by Charles G. Finney. In addition to portraying and voicing the eponymous seven faces (Dr. Lao, the Abominable Snowman, Merlin, Apollonius of Tyana, The Giant Serpent, Pan, and Medusa), Randall also appeared without makeup in a two-second cameo as a solemn spectator in the crowd, for a total of eight roles in the film.

He played the lead in &quot;The Brass Bottle&quot; (1964) and made one last film with Hudson and Day, &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot; (1965). Randall took the lead in &quot;Fluffy&quot; (1965), a comedy about a lion; &quot;The Alphabet Murders&quot; (1965), playing Hercule Poirot for Frank Tashlin; &quot;Our Man in Marrakesh&quot; (1966), as a secret agent; and &quot;Hello Down There&quot; (1969).

Randall returned to Broadway in &quot;UTBU&quot; (1966), which had only a short run. He appeared in the TV movie &quot;The Littlest Angel&quot; (1969) with Johnny Whitaker and Fred Gwynne.

===&quot;The Odd Couple&quot;===

Randall returned to television in 1970 as Felix Unger in &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, opposite Jack Klugman, a role that lasted five years. The names of Felix&#x27;s children in &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; were Edna and Leonard, named for Randall&#x27;s sister and Randall himself. 

In 1974, Randall and Klugman appeared in television spots endorsing a &quot;Yahtzee&quot; spinoff, &quot;Challenge Yahtzee&quot;. They appeared in character as Felix and Oscar, and the TV spots were filmed on the set of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. 

During the series run, Randall took a small role in &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot; (1972).

In 1973, he was hired to play the voice of Templeton the gluttonous rat in &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;, and recorded the part, but was replaced in the film by Paul Lynde, as Randall&#x27;s voice was perceived as too sophisticated by the director, who wanted Templeton to have a nasal voice.

===&quot;The Tony Randall Show&quot; ===
Beginning in 1976, Randall starred for two seasons in &quot;The Tony Randall Show&quot;, playing Philadelphia judge Walter Franklin. He had roles in &quot;Kate Bliss and the Ticker Tape Kid&quot; (1978), &quot;Scavenger Hunt&quot; (1979), and &quot;Foolin&#x27; Around&quot; (1980).

===&quot;Love, Sidney&quot;===
Randall starred in the NBC series &quot;Love, Sidney&quot; from 1981 to 1983. In the TV movie that served as the show&#x27;s pilot, &quot;Sidney Shorr: A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, Sidney Shorr was written as a middle-aged homosexual man; the character&#x27;s sexuality was made ambiguous for the series. After the show was canceled in 1983, Randall refused to star in another television series, favoring the Broadway stage as his medium.

Randall continued to appear in TV movies. He starred in &quot;Sunday Drive&quot; (1986) for Disney, &quot;Save the Dog!&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Man in the Brown Suit&quot; (1989). From October 30 to November 2, 1987, he hosted the free preview of HBO&#x27;s short-lived premium channel Festival.

In 1989, Randall returned to Broadway as a replacement in &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;.

===National Actors Theatre===
In 1991, Randall founded the National Actors Theatre, ultimately based at Pace University in New York City. Their productions included &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1991), &quot;A Little Hotel on the Side&quot; (1992), &quot;The Master Builder&quot; (1992), &quot;The Seagull&quot; (1992), &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (1993), &quot;Three Men on a Horse&quot; (1993), &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; (1993), &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; (1993), &quot;The Flowering Peach&quot; (1994), &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1994), &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1995), &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Gin Game&quot; (1997). In 1997, he performed in &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; with Klugman to great success.

In September 1993, Randall and Klugman reunited in the CBS-TV movie &quot;The Odd Couple: Together Again,&quot; reprising their roles. The story began when, after Felix ruined plans for his daughter Edna&#x27;s wedding, his wife Gloria threw him out of the house for 11 days, which left him no choice but to move back in with Oscar and to help him recover, getting him back in shape after throat cancer surgery had left his voice very raspy.

Randall&#x27;s later stage productions included &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1999) and &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (2001).

Periodically, he performed in stage revivals of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; with Klugman, including a stint in London in 1996. Later film roles included &quot;Fatal Instinct&quot; (1994) and &quot;Down with Love&quot; (2003).

Randall&#x27;s last appearances on stage as an actor were in &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot; (2002) and &quot;Right You Are&quot; (2003).

===Guest appearances===
On September 4, 1955, Randall and Klugman appeared together with Gena Rowlands in the episode &quot;The Pirate&#x27;s House&quot; of the CBS anthology series &quot;Appointment with Adventure&quot;.

Randall was a frequent guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and often spoke of his love of opera and the salaciousness of many of its plotlines. He also admitted to sneaking tape recorders into operas to make his own private recordings. He chided Johnny Carson for his chain smoking and was generally fastidious. At the time of his death, Randall had appeared as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; 105 times, more often than any other celebrity had appeared.

Randall was well-known for being a guest panelist on the game show &quot;What’s My Line?&quot;, from 1958 to 1967, &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;, and the &quot;$10,000&quot; and &quot;$20,000 Pyramids&quot;. He also parodied his pompous image with an appearance as a &quot;contestant&quot; on &quot;The Gong Show&quot; in 1977.

Randall was a guest star on the fifth and final season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in an episode that first aired on October 11, 1980. This was the 100th episode of the show.

Randall, along with John Goodman and Drew Barrymore, was among the first guests on the debut episode of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on September 13, 1993. He would also appear in Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;5th Anniversary Special&quot; with the character PimpBot 5000. Randall was a frequent guest as well on both of David Letterman&#x27;s late-night shows &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, making 70 appearances, according to his obituary in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost/2004/05/19/randall-dies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Letterman said that Randall was one of his favorite guests, along with Regis Philbin.

On November 7, 1994, Randall appeared on the game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, as part of a celebrity episode, playing on behalf of the National Actors Theatre. He came in second place behind General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. but ahead of actress Stefanie Powers, with a final tally of $9,900.

===Other creative activities===
In 1973, Randall and Klugman recorded an album for London Records titled &quot;The Odd Couple Sings&quot;. Roland Shaw and the London Festival Orchestra and Chorus provided the music and additional vocals. The record was not a chart-topper but is a highly sought-after item for many &quot;Odd Couple&quot; fans. Randall and Klugman also collaborated on a series of television commercials for Eagle brand snacks.

A noted raconteur, Randall, along with co-writer Mike Mindlin, wrote a collection of amusing and sometimes racy showbusiness anecdotes called &quot;Which Reminds Me&quot;, published in 1989.

In keeping with his penchant for both championing and mocking the culture that he loved, during the Big Band-era revival in the mid-1960s, Randall produced a record album of 1930s songs, &quot;Vo, Vo, De, Oh, Doe&quot;, inspired by (and covering) the New Vaudeville Band&#x27;s one-hit wonder, &quot;Winchester Cathedral.&quot; He mimicked (and somewhat exaggerated) the vibrato style of Carmen Lombardo, and the two had once sung a duet of Lombardo&#x27;s signature song &quot;Boo Hoo (You&#x27;ve Got Me Crying for You)&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

In the 1980s, Randall served as off-camera narrator for several video productions by the Metropolitan Opera, announcing performers to the television audience as they appeared on stage during curtain calls and providing brief descriptions of scenes. 

For the 1990 sequel &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot;, Randall voiced the Brain Gremlin.

==Personal life==

Randall was married to his high school sweetheart, Florence Gibbs,&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodreporter/1302428&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; from 1938 until her death from cancer on April 18, 1992. They had no children. On November 17, 1995, at the age of 75, he married 25-year-old Heather Harlan,&lt;ref name=&quot;marieclaire/a1123&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; an understudy from the production of &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; in which Randall was starring at National Actors Theatre; the ceremony was officiated by Rudy Giuliani.&lt;ref name=&quot;seattlepi/1303064&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in a Manhattan apartment and bought a vacation apartment in Key Biscayne, Florida, in 2003. The couple had two children, Julia, born on April 11, 1997, and Jefferson, born on June 15, 1998—and remained married until Randall&#x27;s death in May 2004.

In his book &quot;Which Reminds Me&quot;, Randall maintained that any publicity that an actor generates should be about his work, not himself: &quot;The public knows only one thing about me: I don&#x27;t smoke.&quot;

==Advocacy and politics==
Randall was an advocate for the arts. During the summer of 1980, he served as the celebrity host of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra&#x27;s concerts in Central Park, New York City.

Randall was politically liberal. He was an active supporter of Eugene McCarthy during the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries. When he was dropped as a regular panelist on the &quot;Opera Quiz&quot; intermission feature of the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts because of his opposition to the Vietnam War, he donated the remainder of his contract fee to the McCarthy campaign. During the U.S. presidential primaries in 1972, he appeared as the featured celebrity at numerous fundraising house parties for Democratic Party candidate George McGovern. His name was featured on the master list of Richard Nixon&#x27;s political opponents.

==Death==
Randall died in his sleep on May 17, 2004, at NYU Medical Center of pneumonia that he had contracted following coronary bypass surgery in December 2003. He had been hospitalized since the operation. His remains are interred at the Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

<doc id="438944" wikidata="Q185269" url="?curid=438944" title="Actin">
<text>Actin is a family of globular multi-functional proteins that form microfilaments in the cytoskeleton, and the thin filaments in muscle fibrils. It is found in essentially all eukaryotic cells, where it may be present at a concentration of over 100 μM; its mass is roughly 42 kDa, with a diameter of 4 to 7 nm.

An actin protein is the monomeric subunit of two types of filaments in cells: microfilaments, one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton, and thin filaments, part of the contractile apparatus in muscle cells. It can be present as either a free monomer called G-actin (globular) or as part of a linear polymer microfilament called F-actin (filamentous), both of which are essential for such important cellular functions as the mobility and contraction of cells during cell division.

Actin participates in many important cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell motility, cell division and cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle movement, cell signaling, and the establishment and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape. Many of these processes are mediated by extensive and intimate interactions of actin with cellular membranes. In vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta, and gamma have been identified. The alpha actins, found in muscle tissues, are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins coexist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility. It is believed that the diverse range of structures formed by actin enabling it to fulfill such a large range of functions is regulated through the binding of tropomyosin along the filaments.

A cell&#x27;s ability to dynamically form microfilaments provides the scaffolding that allows it to rapidly remodel itself in response to its environment or to the organism&#x27;s internal signals, for example, to increase cell membrane absorption or increase cell adhesion in order to form cell tissue. Other enzymes or organelles such as cilia can be anchored to this scaffolding in order to control the deformation of the external cell membrane, which allows endocytosis and cytokinesis. It can also produce movement either by itself or with the help of molecular motors. Actin therefore contributes to processes such as the intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles as well as muscular contraction and cellular migration. It therefore plays an important role in embryogenesis, the healing of wounds, and the invasivity of cancer cells. The evolutionary origin of actin can be traced to prokaryotic cells, which have equivalent proteins. Actin homologs from prokaryotes and archaea polymerize into different helical or linear filaments consisting of one or multiple strands. However the in-strand contacts and nucleotide binding sites are preserved in prokaryotes and in archaea. Lastly, actin plays an important role in the control of gene expression.

A large number of illnesses and diseases are caused by mutations in alleles of the genes that regulate the production of actin or of its associated proteins. The production of actin is also key to the process of infection by some pathogenic microorganisms. Mutations in the different genes that regulate actin production in humans can cause muscular diseases, variations in the size and function of the heart as well as deafness. The make-up of the cytoskeleton is also related to the pathogenicity of intracellular bacteria and viruses, particularly in the processes related to evading the actions of the immune system.

== Function ==
Actin&#x27;s primary role in the cell is to form linear polymers called microfilaments that serve various functions in the cell&#x27;s structure, trafficking networks, migration, and replication. The multifaceted role of actin relies on a few of the microfilaments&#x27; properties: First, the formation of actin filaments is reversible, and their function often involves undergoing rapid polymerization and depolymerization. Second, microfilaments are polarized – i.e. the two ends of a filament are distinct from one another. Third, actin filaments can bind to many other proteins, which together help modify and organize microfilaments for their diverse functions.

In most cells actin filaments form larger-scale networks which are essential for many key functions:
* Actin networks give mechanical support to cells and provide trafficking routes through the cytoplasm to aid signal transduction.
* Rapid assembly and disassembly of actin network enables cells to migrate (Cell migration).

Actin is extremely abundant in most cells, comprising 1–5% of the total protein mass of most cells, and 10% of muscle cells.

The actin protein is found in both the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus. Its location is regulated by cell membrane signal transduction pathways that integrate the stimuli that a cell receives stimulating the restructuring of the actin networks in response.

=== Cytoskeleton ===
There are a number of different types of actin with slightly different structures and functions. α-actin is found exclusively in muscle fibres, while β- and γ-actin are found in other cells. As the latter types have a high turnover rate the majority of them are found outside permanent structures. Microfilaments found in cells other than muscle cells are present in three forms:
* Microfilament networks - Animal cells commonly have a cell cortex under the cell membrane that contains a large number of microfilaments, which precludes the presence of organelles. This network is connected with numerous receptors that relay signals to the outside of a cell.
* Periodic actin rings - A periodic structure constructed of evenly spaced actin rings is found in axons. In this structure, the actin rings, together with spectrin tetramers that link the neighboring actin rings, form a cohesive cytoskeleton that supports the axon membrane. The structure periodicity may also regulate the sodium ion channels in axons.

==== Yeasts ====
Actin&#x27;s cytoskeleton is key to the processes of endocytosis, cytokinesis, determination of cell polarity and morphogenesis in yeasts. In addition to relying on actin, these processes involve 20 or 30 associated proteins, which all have a high degree of evolutionary conservation, along with many signalling molecules. Together these elements allow a spatially and temporally modulated assembly that defines a cell&#x27;s response to both internal and external stimuli.

Yeasts contain three main elements that are associated with actin: patches, cables, and rings. Despite not being present for long, these structures are subject to a dynamic equilibrium due to continual polymerization and depolymerization. They possess a number of accessory proteins including ADF/cofilin, which has a molecular weight of 16kDa and is coded for by a single gene, called &quot;COF1&quot;; Aip1, a cofilin cofactor that promotes the disassembly of microfilaments; Srv2/CAP, a process regulator related to adenylate cyclase proteins; a profilin with a molecular weight of approximately 14 kDa that is related/associated with actin monomers; and twinfilin, a 40 kDa protein involved in the organization of patches.

==== Plants ====
Plant genome studies have revealed the existence of protein isovariants within the actin family of genes. Within &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, a model organism, there are ten types of actin, six profilins, and dozens of myosins. This diversity is explained by the evolutionary necessity of possessing variants that slightly differ in their temporal and spatial expression. The majority of these proteins were jointly expressed in the tissue analysed. Actin networks are distributed throughout the cytoplasm of cells that have been cultivated &quot;in vitro&quot;. There is a concentration of the network around the nucleus that is connected via spokes to the cellular cortex, this network is highly dynamic, with a continuous polymerization and depolymerization.

Even though the majority of plant cells have a cell wall that defines their morphology, their microfilaments can generate sufficient force to achieve a number of cellular activities, such as the cytoplasmic currents generated by the microfilaments and myosin. Actin is also involved in the movement of organelles and in cellular morphogenesis, which involve cell division as well as the elongation and differentiation of the cell.

The most notable proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton in plants include: villin, which belongs to the same family as gelsolin/severin and is able to cut microfilaments and bind actin monomers in the presence of calcium cations; fimbrin, which is able to recognize and unite actin monomers and which is involved in the formation of networks (by a different regulation process from that of animals and yeasts); formins, which are able to act as an F-actin polymerization nucleating agent; myosin, a typical molecular motor that is specific to eukaryotes and which in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; is coded for by 17 genes in two distinct classes; CHUP1, which can bind actin and is implicated in the spatial distribution of chloroplasts in the cell; KAM1/MUR3 that define the morphology of the Golgi apparatus as well as the composition of xyloglucans in the cell wall; NtWLIM1, which facilitates the emergence of actin cell structures; and ERD10, which is involved in the association of organelles within membranes and microfilaments and which seems to play a role that is involved in an organism&#x27;s reaction to stress.

=== Nuclear actin ===
Nuclear actin was first noticed and described in 1977 by Clark and Merriam. Authors describe a protein present in the nuclear fraction, obtained from &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; oocytes, which shows the same features as skeletal muscle actin. Since that time there have been many scientific reports about the structure and functions of actin in the nucleus (for review see: Hofmann 2009.) The controlled level of actin in the nucleus, its interaction with actin-binding proteins (ABP) and the presence of different isoforms allows actin to play an important role in many important nuclear processes.

==== Transport through the nuclear membrane ====
The actin sequence does not contain a nuclear localization signal. The small size of actin (about 43 kDa) allows it to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion. The import of actin into the nucleus (probably in a complex with cofilin) is facilitated by the import protein importin 9.

Low levels of actin in the nucleus seems to be important, because actin has two nuclear export signals (NES) in its sequence. Microinjected actin is quickly removed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Actin is exported at least in two ways, through exportin 1 and exportin 6. Specific modifications, such as SUMOylation, allows for nuclear actin retention. A mutation preventing SUMOylation causes rapid export of beta actin from the nucleus.

==== Organization ====
Nuclear actin exists mainly as a monomer, but can also form dynamic oligomers and short polymers. Nuclear actin organization varies in different cell types. For example, in &quot;Xenopus&quot; oocytes (with higher nuclear actin level in comparison to somatic cells) actin forms filaments, which stabilize nucleus architecture. These filaments can be observed under the microscope thanks to fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin staining.

In somatic cell nuclei, however, actin filaments cannot be observed using this technique. The DNase I inhibition assay, the only test which allows the quantification of the polymerized actin directly in biological samples, has revealed that endogenous nuclear actin indeed occurs mainly in a monomeric form.

Precisely controlled level of actin in the cell nucleus, lower than in the cytoplasm, prevents the formation of filaments. The polymerization is also reduced by the limited access to actin monomers, which are bound in complexes with ABPs, mainly cofilin.

==== Actin isoforms ====
Different isoforms of actin are present in the cell nucleus. The level of actin isoforms may change in response to stimulation of cell growth or arrest of proliferation and transcriptional activity. Research on nuclear actin is focused on isoform beta. However the use of antibodies directed against different actin isoforms allows identifying not only the cytoplasmic beta in the cell nucleus, but also alpha- and gamma-actin in certain cell types. The presence of different isoforms of actin may have a significant effect on its function in nuclear processes, as the level of individual isoforms can be controlled independently.

==== Functions ====
Functions of actin in the nucleus are associated with its ability to polymerize and interact with various ABPs and with structural elements of the nucleus. Nuclear actin is involved in:
* Architecture of the nucleus - Interaction of actin with alpha II-spectrin and other proteins are important for maintaining proper shape of the nucleus.
* Transcription – Actin is involved in chromatin reorganization, transcription initiation and interaction with the transcription complex. Actin takes part in the regulation of chromatin structure, interacting with RNA polymerase I, II and III. In Pol I transcription, actin and myosin (MYO1C, which binds DNA) act as a molecular motor. For Pol II transcription, β-actin is needed for the formation of the preinitiation complex. Pol III contains β-actin as a subunit. Actin can also be a component of chromatin remodelling complexes as well as pre-mRNP particles (that is, precursor messenger RNA bundled in proteins), and is involved in nuclear export of RNAs and proteins.
* Regulation of gene activity – Actin binds to the regulatory regions of different kinds of genes. Actin&#x27;s ability to regulate gene activity is used in the molecular reprogramming method, which allows differentiated cells return to their embryonic state.
* Translocation of the activated chromosome fragment from under membrane region to euchromatin where transcription starts. This movement requires the interaction of actin and myosin.
* Integration of different cellular compartments. Actin is a molecule that integrates cytoplasmic and nuclear signal transduction pathways. An example is the activation of transcription in response to serum stimulation of cells &quot;in vitro&quot;.
* Immune response - Nuclear actin polymerizes upon T-cell receptor stimulation and is required for cytokine expression and antibody production &quot;in vivo&quot;.
* DNA repair - Nuclear actin mediates the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. In the cell nucleus, a filamentous polymer of actin (F-actin) acts both in the DNA repair pathway of non homologous end joining and in the pathway of homologous recombinational repair.

Due to its ability to undergo conformational changes and interaction with many proteins, actin acts as a regulator of formation and activity of protein complexes such as transcriptional complex.

=== Cell movement ===
Actin is also involved in cell movement. A meshwork of actin filaments marks the forward edge of a moving cell, and the polymerization of new actin filaments pushes the cell membrane forward in protrusions called lamellipodia. These membrane protrusions then attach to the substrate, forming structures known as focal adhesions that connect to the actin network. Once attached, the rear of the cell body contracts squeezing its contents forward past the adhesion point. Once the adhesion point has moved to the rear of the cell, the cell disassembles it, allowing the rear of the cell to move forward.
=== Actin/myosin movement ===

In addition to the physical force generated by actin polymerization, microfilaments facilitate the movement of various intracellular components by serving as the roadway along which a family of motor proteins called myosins travel.

==== Muscle contraction ====

Actin plays a particularly prominent role in muscle cells, which consist largely of repeated bundles of actin and myosin II. Each repeated unit – called a sarcomere – consists of two sets of oppositely oriented F-actin strands (&quot;thin filaments&quot;), interlaced with bundles of myosin (&quot;thick filaments&quot;). The two sets of actin strands are oriented with their (+) ends embedded in either end of the sarcomere in delimiting structures called Z-disks. The myosin fibrils are in the middle between the sets of actin filaments, with strands facing in both directions. When the muscle contracts, the myosin threads move along the actin filaments towards the (+) end, pulling the ends of the sarcomere together and shortening it by around 70% of its length. In order to move along the actin thread, myosin must hydrolyze ATP; thus ATP serves as the energy source for muscle contraction.

At times of rest, the proteins tropomyosin and troponin bind to the actin filaments, preventing the attachment of myosin. When an activation signal (i.e. an action potential) arrives at the muscle fiber, it triggers the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. The resulting spike in cytosolic calcium rapidly releases tropomyosin and troponin from the actin thread, allowing myosin to bind, and muscle contracation to begin.

====Cell division====
In the final stages of cell division, many cells form a ring of actin at the cell&#x27;s midpoint. This ring, aptly called the &quot;contractile ring&quot;, uses a similar mechanism as muscle fibers where myosin II pulls along the actin ring, causing it to contract. This contraction cleaves the parent cell into two, completing cytokinesis. The contractile ring is composed of actin, myosin, anillin, and α-actinin. In the fission yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;, actin is actively formed in the constricting ring with the participation of Arp3, the formin Cdc12, profilin, and WASp, along with preformed microfilaments. Once the ring has been constructed the structure is maintained by a continual assembly and disassembly that, aided by the Arp2/3 complex and formins, is key to one of the central processes of cytokinesis.

====Intracellular trafficking====
Actin-myosin pairs can also participate in the trafficking of various membrane vesicles and organelles within the cell. Myosin V is activated by binding to various cargo receptors on organelles, and then moves along an actin filament towards the (+) end, pulling its cargo along with it.

These nonconventional myosins use ATP hydrolysis to transport cargo, such as vesicles and organelles, in a directed fashion much faster than diffusion. Myosin V walks towards the barbed end of actin filaments, while myosin VI walks toward the pointed end. Most actin filaments are arranged with the barbed end toward the cellular membrane and the pointed end toward the cellular interior. This arrangement allows myosin V to be an effective motor for the export of cargos, and myosin VI to be an effective motor for import.

=== Other biological processes ===
The traditional image of actin&#x27;s function relates it to the maintenance of the cytoskeleton and, therefore, the organization and movement of organelles, as well as the determination of a cell&#x27;s shape. However, actin has a wider role in eukaryotic cell physiology, in addition to similar functions in prokaryotes.
* Apoptosis. During programmed cell death the ICE/ced-3 family of proteases (one of the interleukin-1β-converter proteases) degrade actin into two fragments &quot;in vivo&quot;; one of the fragments is 15 kDa and the other 31 kDa. This represents one of the mechanisms involved in destroying cell viability that form the basis of apoptosis. The protease calpain has also been shown to be involved in this type of cell destruction; just as the use of calpain inhibitors has been shown to decrease actin proteolysis and the degradation of DNA (another of the characteristic elements of apoptosis). On the other hand, the stress-induced triggering of apoptosis causes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (which also involves its polymerization), giving rise to structures called stress fibers; this is activated by the MAP kinase pathway.
* Cellular adhesion and development. The adhesion between cells is a characteristic of multicellular organisms that enables tissue specialization and therefore increases cell complexity. Adhesion of cell epithelia involves the actin cytoskeleton in each of the joined cells as well as cadherins acting as extracellular elements with the connection between the two mediated by catenins. Interfering in actin dynamics has repercussions for an organism&#x27;s development, in fact actin is such a crucial element that systems of redundant genes are available. For example, if the α-actinin or gelation factor gene has been removed in &quot;Dictyostelium&quot; individuals do not show an anomalous phenotype possibly due to the fact that each of the proteins can perform the function of the other. However, the development of double mutations that lack both gene types is affected.
* Gene expression modulation. Actin&#x27;s state of polymerization affects the pattern of gene expression. In 1997, it was discovered that cytocalasin D-mediated depolymerization in Schwann cells causes a specific pattern of expression for the genes involved in the myelinization of this type of nerve cell. F-actin has been shown to modify the transcriptome in some of the life stages of unicellular organisms, such as the fungus &quot;Candida albicans&quot;. In addition, proteins that are similar to actin play a regulatory role during spermatogenesis in mice and, in yeasts, actin-like proteins are thought to play a role in the regulation of gene expression. In fact, actin is capable of acting as a transcription initiator when it reacts with a type of nuclear myosin that interacts with RNA polymerases and other enzymes involved in the transcription process.
* Stereocilia dynamics. Some cells develop fine filiform outgrowths on their surface that have a mechanosensory function. For example, this type of organelle is present in the Organ of Corti, which is located in the ear. The main characteristic of these structures is that their length can be modified. The molecular architecture of the stereocilia includes a paracrystalline actin core in dynamic equilibrium with the monomers present in the adjacent cytosol. Type VI and VIIa myosins are present throughout this core, while myosin XVa is present in its extremities in quantities that are proportional to the length of the stereocilia.
* Intrinsic chirality. Actomyosin networks have been implicated in generating an intrinsic chirality in individual cells. Cells grown out on chiral surfaces can show a directional left/right bias that is actomyosin dependent.

== Structure ==
Monomeric actin, or G-actin, has a globular structure consisting of two lobes separated by a deep cleft. The bottom of the cleft represents the &quot;ATPase fold&quot;, a structure conserved among ATP and GTP-binding proteins that binds to a magnesium ion and a molecule of ATP. Binding of ATP or ADP is required to stabilize each actin monomer; without one of these molecules bound, actin quickly becomes denatured.

The X-ray crystallography model of actin that was produced by Kabsch from the striated muscle tissue of rabbits is the most commonly used in structural studies as it was the first to be purified. The G-actin crystallized by Kabsch is approximately 67 x 40 x 37 Å in size, has a molecular mass of 41,785 Da and an estimated isoelectric point of 4.8. Its net charge at pH = 7 is -7.

;Primary structure

Elzinga and co-workers first determined the complete peptide sequence for this type of actin in 1973, with later work by the same author adding further detail to the model. It contains 374 amino acid residues. Its N-terminus is highly acidic and starts with an acetyled aspartate in its amino group. While its C-terminus is alkaline and is formed by a phenylalanine preceded by a cysteine, which has a degree of functional importance. Both extremes are in close proximity within the I-subdomain. An anomalous &quot;N&quot;τ-methylhistidine is located at position 73.

;Tertiary structure — domains

The tertiary structure is formed by two domains known as the large and the small, which are separated by a cleft centred around the location of the bond with ATP-ADP+Pi. Below this there is a deeper notch called a &quot;groove&quot;. In the native state, despite their names, both have a comparable depth.

The normal convention in topological studies means that a protein is shown with the biggest domain on the left-hand side and the smallest domain on the right-hand side. In this position the smaller domain is in turn divided into two: subdomain I (lower position, residues 1–32, 70–144, and 338–374) and subdomain II (upper position, residues 33–69). The larger domain is also divided in two: subdomain III (lower, residues 145–180 and 270–337) and subdomain IV (higher, residues 181–269). The exposed areas of subdomains I and III are referred to as the &quot;barbed&quot; ends, while the exposed areas of domains II and IV are termed the &quot;pointed&quot; ends. This nomenclature refers to the fact that, due to the small mass of subdomain II actin is polar; the importance of this will be discussed below in the discussion on assembly dynamics. Some authors call the subdomains Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb, respectively.

;Other important structures

The most notable supersecondary structure is a five chain beta sheet that is composed of a β-meander and a β-α-β clockwise unit. It is present in both domains suggesting that the protein arose from gene duplication.
* The adenosine nucleotide binding site is located between two beta hairpin-shaped structures pertaining to the I and III domains. The residues that are involved are Asp11-Lys18 and Asp154-His161 respectively.
* The divalent cation binding site is located just below that for the adenosine nucleotide. &quot;In vivo&quot; it is most often formed by Mg2+ or Ca2+ while &quot;in vitro&quot; it is formed by a chelating structure made up of Lys18 and two oxygens from the nucleotide&#x27;s α-and β-phosphates. This calcium is coordinated with six water molecules that are retained by the amino acids Asp11, Asp154, and Gln137. They form a complex with the nucleotide that restricts the movements of the so-called &quot;hinge&quot; region, located between residues 137 and 144. This maintains the native form of the protein until its withdrawal denatures the actin monomer. This region is also important because it determines whether the protein&#x27;s cleft is in the &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; conformation.
* It is highly likely that there are at least three other centres with a lesser affinity (intermediate) and still others with a low affinity for divalent cations. It has been suggested that these centres may play a role in the polymerization of actin by acting during the activation stage.
* There is a structure in subdomain 2 that is called the &quot;D-loop&quot; because it binds with DNase I, it is located between the His40 and Gly48 residues. It has the appearance of a disorderly element in the majority of crystals, but it looks like a β-sheet when it is complexed with DNase I. It has been proposed that the key event in polymerization is probably the propagation of a conformational change from the centre of the bond with the nucleotide to this domain, which changes from a loop to a spiral. However, this hypothesis has been refuted by other studies.

=== F-actin ===
Under various conditions, G-actin molecules polymerize into longer threads called &quot;filamentous-&quot; or &quot;F-actin&quot;. These F-actin threads are typically composed of two helical strands of actin wound around each other, forming a 7 to 9 nanometer wide helix that repeats every 72 nanometers (or every 14 G-actin subunits). In F-actin threads, G-actin molecules are all oriented in the same direction. The two ends of the F-actin thread are distinct from one another. At one end – designated the (−) end – the ATP-binding cleft of the terminal actin molecule is facing outward. At the opposite end – designated (+) – the ATP-binding cleft is buried in the filament, contacting the neighboring actin molecule. As F-actin threads grow, new molecules tend to join at the (+) end of an existing F-actin strand. Conversely, threads tend to shrink by shedding actin monomers from the strand&#x27;s (−) end.

Some proteins, such as cofilin appear to increase the angle of turn, but again this could be interpreted as the establishment of different structural states. These could be important in the polymerization process.

There is less agreement regarding measurements of the turn radius and filament thickness: while the first models assigned a length of 25 Å, current X-ray diffraction data, backed up by cryo-electron microscopy suggests a length of 23.7 Å. These studies have shown the precise contact points between monomers. Some are formed with units of the same chain, between the &quot;barbed&quot; end on one monomer and the &quot;pointed&quot; end of the next one. While the monomers in adjacent chains make lateral contact through projections from subdomain IV, with the most important projections being those formed by the C-terminus and the hydrophobic link formed by three bodies involving residues 39–42, 201–203, and 286. This model suggests that a filament is formed by monomers in a &quot;sheet&quot; formation, in which the subdomains turn about themselves, this form is also found in the bacterial actin homologue MreB.

The terms &quot;pointed&quot; and &quot;barbed&quot; referring to the two ends of the microfilaments derive from their appearance under transmission electron microscopy when samples are examined following a preparation technique called &quot;decoration&quot;. This method consists of the addition of myosin S1 fragments to tissue that has been fixed with tannic acid. This myosin forms polar bonds with actin monomers, giving rise to a configuration that looks like arrows with feather fletchings along its shaft, where the shaft is the actin and the fletchings are the myosin. Following this logic, the end of the microfilament that does not have any protruding myosin is called the point of the arrow (− end) and the other end is called the barbed end (+ end).
A S1 fragment is composed of the head and neck domains of myosin II. Under physiological conditions, G-actin (the monomer form) is transformed to F-actin (the polymer form) by ATP, where the role of ATP is essential.

The helical F-actin filament found in muscles also contains a tropomyosin molecule, which is a 40 nanometre long protein that is wrapped around the F-actin helix. During the resting phase the tropomyosin covers the actin&#x27;s active sites so that the actin-myosin interaction cannot take place and produce muscular contraction. There are other protein molecules bound to the tropomyosin thread, these are the troponins that have three polymers: troponin I, troponin T, and troponin C.

F-actin is both strong and dynamic. Unlike other polymers, such as DNA, whose constituent elements are bound together with covalent bonds, the monomers of actin filaments are assembled by weaker bonds. The lateral bonds with neighbouring monomers resolve this anomaly, which in theory should weaken the structure as they can be broken by thermal agitation. In addition, the weak bonds give the advantage that the filament ends can easily release or incorporate monomers. This means that the filaments can be rapidly remodelled and can change cellular structure in response to an environmental stimulus. Which, along with the biochemical mechanism by which it is brought about is known as the &quot;assembly dynamic&quot;.

=== Folding ===
Actin can spontaneously acquire a large part of its tertiary structure. However, the way it acquires its fully functional form from its newly synthesized native form is special and almost unique in protein chemistry. The reason for this special route could be the need to avoid the presence of incorrectly folded actin monomers, which could be toxic as they can act as inefficient polymerization terminators. Nevertheless, it is key to establishing the stability of the cytoskeleton, and additionally, it is an essential process for coordinating the cell cycle.

CCT is required in order to ensure that folding takes place correctly. CCT is a group II chaperonin, a large protein complex that assists in the folding of other proteins. CCT is formed of a double ring of eight different subunits (hetero-octameric) and it differs from group I chaperonins like GroEL, which is found in Eubacteria and in eukaryotic organelles, as it does not require a co-chaperone to act as a lid over the central catalytic cavity. Substrates bind to CCT through specific domains. It was initially thought that it only bound with actin and tubulin, although recent immunoprecipitation studies have shown that it interacts with a large number of polypeptides, which possibly function as substrates. It acts through ATP-dependent conformational changes that on occasion require several rounds of liberation and catalysis in order to complete a reaction.

In order to successfully complete their folding, both actin and tubulin need to interact with another protein called prefoldin, which is a heterohexameric complex (formed by six distinct subunits), in an interaction that is so specific that the molecules have coevolved. Actin complexes with prefoldin while it is still being formed, when it is approximately 145 amino acids long, specifically those at the N-terminal.

Different recognition sub-units are used for actin or tubulin although there is some overlap. In actin the subunits that bind with prefoldin are probably PFD3 and PFD4, which bind in two places one between residues 60–79 and the other between residues 170–198. The actin is recognized, loaded, and delivered to the cytosolic chaperonin (CCT) in an open conformation by the inner end of prefoldin&#x27;s &quot;tentacles&quot; (see the image and note). The contact when actin is delivered is so brief that a tertiary complex is not formed, immediately freeing the prefoldin.

The CCT then causes actin&#x27;s sequential folding by forming bonds with its subunits rather than simply enclosing it in its cavity. This is why it possesses specific recognition areas in its apical β-domain. The first stage in the folding consists of the recognition of residues 245–249. Next, other determinants establish contact. Both actin and tubulin bind to CCT in open conformations in the absence of ATP. In actin&#x27;s case, two subunits are bound during each conformational change, whereas for tubulin binding takes place with four subunits. Actin has specific binding sequences, which interact with the δ and β-CCT subunits or with δ-CCT and ε-CCT. After AMP-PNP is bound to CCT the substrates move within the chaperonin&#x27;s cavity. It also seems that in the case of actin, the CAP protein is required as a possible cofactor in actin&#x27;s final folding states.

The exact manner by which this process is regulated is still not fully understood, but it is known that the protein PhLP3 (a protein similar to phosducin) inhibits its activity through the formation of a tertiary complex.

=== ATPase&#x27;s catalytic mechanism ===
Actin is an ATPase, which means that it is an enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP. This group of enzymes is characterised by their slow reaction rates. It is known that this ATPase is &quot;active&quot;, that is, its speed increases by some 40,000 times when the actin forms part of a filament. A reference value for this rate of hydrolysis under ideal conditions is around 0.3 s−1. Then, the Pi remains bound to the actin next to the ADP for a long time, until it is cooperatively liberated from the interior of the filament.

The exact molecular details of the catalytic mechanism are still not fully understood. Although there is much debate on this issue, it seems certain that a &quot;closed&quot; conformation is required for the hydrolysis of ATP, and it is thought that the residues that are involved in the process move to the appropriate distance. The glutamic acid Glu137 is one of the key residues, which is located in subdomain 1. Its function is to bind the water molecule that produces a nucleophilic attack on the ATP&#x27;s γ-phosphate bond, while the nucleotide is strongly bound to subdomains 3 and 4. The slowness of the catalytic process is due to the large distance and skewed position of the water molecule in relation to the reactant. It is highly likely that the conformational change produced by the rotation of the domains between actin&#x27;s G and F forms moves the Glu137 closer allowing its hydrolysis. This model suggests that the polymerization and ATPase&#x27;s function would be decoupled straight away. The &quot;open&quot; to &quot;closed&quot; transformation between G and F forms and its implications on the relative motion of several key residues and the formation of water wires have been characterized in molecular dynamics and QM/MM simulations.

== Assembly dynamics ==
Actin filaments are often rapidly assembled and disassembled, allowing them to generate force and support cell movement. Assembly classically occurs in three steps. First, the &quot;nucleation phase&quot;, in which two to three G-actin molecules slowly join to form a small oligomer that will nucleate further growth. Second, the &quot;elongation phase&quot;, when the actin filament rapidly grows by the addition of many actin molecules to both ends. As the filament grows, actin molecules are added to the (+) end of the filament around 10 times faster than to the (−) end, and so filaments tend to primarily grow at the (+) end. Third, the &quot;steady-state phase&quot;, where an equillibrium is reached as actin molecules join and leave the filament at the same rate, maintaining the filament&#x27;s length. While the filament&#x27;s length remains constant in the steady-state phase, new molecules are constantly being added to the (+) end and falling off the (−) end, a phenomenon called &quot;treadmilling&quot; as a given actin molecule would appear to move along the strand. In isolation, whether a filament will grow or shrink, and how quickly, are determined by the concentration of G-actin around the filament; however, in cells, the dynamics of actin filaments are heavily influenced by various actin-binding proteins.
=== Actin binding proteins ===

The actin cytoskeleton &quot;in vivo&quot; is not exclusively composed of actin, other proteins are required for its formation, continuance, and function. These proteins are called actin-binding proteins and they are involved in actin&#x27;s polymerization, depolymerization, stability, and organisation. The diversity of these proteins is such that actin is thought to be the protein that takes part in the greatest number of protein-protein interactions.

The nucleation of new actin filaments – the rate-limiting step in actin polymerization – is aided by actin-nucleating proteins such as formins (like formin-2) and the Arp2/3 complex. Formins help to nucleate long actin filaments. They bind two free actin-ATP molecules, bringing them together. Then as the filament begins to grow, formin moves along the (+) end of the growing filament, all the while recruiting actin-binding proteins that promote filament growth, and excluding capping proteins that would block filament extension. Branches in actin filaments are typically nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex in concert with nucleation promoting factors. Nucleation promoting factors bind two free G-actin molecules, then recruit and activate the Arp2/3 complex. The activated Arp2/3 complex attaches to an existing actin filament, and uses the two bound G-actin molecules to nucleate a new actin filament branching off of the old one at a 70° angle.

As filaments grow, the pool of available G-actin molecules is managed by G-actin-binding proteins such as profilin and thymosin β-4. Profilin ensures a supply of available actin-ATP by binding to ADP-bound G-actin and promoting the exchange of ADP for ATP. Profilin&#x27;s binding to the actin molecule physically blocks its addition to a filament&#x27;s (−) end, but permits it to join the (+) end. Once the actin-ATP has joined the filament, profilin releases it. As formins promote the nucleation and extension of new actin filaments, they recruit profilin to the area, increasing the local concentration of actin-ATP to boost filament growth. In contrast, thymosin β-4 binds and sequesters actin-ATP, preventing it from joining a microfilament.

Once an actin fiber is established, the dynamics of its growth or collapse are influenced by numerous proteins. Existing strands can be interrupted by filament cleaving proteins, such as cofilin and gelsolin. Cofilin binds along two actin-ADP molecules in a filament, forcing a movement that destabilizes the filament and causes it to break. Gelsolin inserts itself between actin molecules in a filament, disrupting the filament. After the filament breaks, gelsolin remains attached to the new (+) end, preventing it from growing, thus forcing its disassembly.

Other proteins bind to the ends of actin filaments, stabilizing them. These are called &quot;capping proteins&quot; and include CapZ and tropomodulin. CapZ binds the (+) end of a filament, preventing further addition or loss of actin from that end. Tropomodulin binds to a filament&#x27;s (−) end, again preventing addition or loss of molecule&#x27;s at that end. Tropomodulin is typically found in cells that require extremely stable actin filaments, such as those in muscle and red blood cells.

These actin binding proteins are typically regulated by various cellular signals to control actin assembly dynamics in different cellular locations. Formins, for example, are typically folded in an inactive conformation until they&#x27;re activated by the binding of the small GTPase Rho. Actin branching at the cell membrane is important for cell movement, and so the plasma membrane lipid PIP2 activates the nucleation promoting factor WASp and inhibits CapZ. WASp is also activated by the small GTPase Cdc42, while another nucleation promoting factor WAVE is activated by the GTPase Rac1. 

== Genetics ==
Although most yeasts have only a single actin gene, higher eukaryotes, in general, express several isoforms of actin encoded by a family of related genes. Mammals have at least six actin isoforms coded by separate genes, which are divided into three classes – alpha, beta, and gamma – according to their isoelectric points. In general, alpha actins are found in muscle (α-skeletal, α-aortic smooth, α-cardiac), whereas beta and gamma isoforms are prominent in non-muscle cells (β-cytoplasmic, γ1-cytoplasmic, γ2-enteric smooth). Although the amino acid sequences and &quot;in vitro&quot; properties of the isoforms are highly similar, these isoforms cannot completely substitute for one another &quot;in vivo&quot;. Plants contains more than 60 actin genes and pseudogenes.

The typical actin gene has an approximately 100-nucleotide 5&#x27; UTR, a 1200-nucleotide translated region, and a 200-nucleotide 3&#x27; UTR. The majority of actin genes are interrupted by introns, with up to six introns in any of 19 well-characterised locations. The high conservation of the family makes actin the favoured model for studies comparing the introns-early and introns-late models of intron evolution.

== Evolution ==
Actin and closely related proteins are present in all organisms, suggesting the common ancestor of all life on Earth had actin. Actin is one of the most conserved proteins throughout the evolution of eukaryotes. The sequences of actin proteins from animals and amoebae are 80% identical despite being separated by approximately one billion years of evolution. Many unicellular eukaryotes have a single actin gene, while multicellular eukaryotes often have several closely related genes that serve specialized functions. Humans have six; plants have 10 or more. In addition to actin, eukaryotes have a large family of actin-related proteins, or &quot;Arps&quot;, that share a common ancestor with actin and are called Arp1–Arp11, with Arp1 the most closely related to actin, and Arp11 the least.

Bacteria encode three types of actin: MreB influences cell shape, FtsA cell division, and ParM separation of large plasmids. Some archaea have a bacteria-like MreB gene, while others have an actin gene that more closely resembles eukaryote actin.

The eukaryotic cytoskeleton of organisms among all taxonomic groups have similar components to actin and tubulin. For example, the protein that is coded by the &quot;ACTG2&quot; gene in humans is completely equivalent to the homologues present in rats and mice, even though at a nucleotide level the similarity decreases to 92%. However, there are major differences with the equivalents in prokaryotes (FtsZ and MreB), where the similarity between nucleotide sequences is between 40 and 50% among different bacteria and archaea species. Some authors suggest that the ancestral protein that gave rise to the model eukaryotic actin resembles the proteins present in modern bacterial cytoskeletons.

Some authors point out that the behaviour of actin, tubulin, and histone, a protein involved in the stabilization and regulation of DNA, are similar in their ability to bind nucleotides and in their ability of take advantage of Brownian motion. It has also been suggested that they all have a common ancestor. Therefore, evolutionary processes resulted in the diversification of ancestral proteins into the varieties present today, conserving, among others, actins as efficient molecules that were able to tackle essential ancestral biological processes, such as endocytosis.

The Arp2/3 complex is widely found in all eukaryotic organisms.

===Equivalents in prokaryotes===
The bacterial cytoskeleton contains proteins that are highly similar to actin monomers and polymers. The bacterial protein MreB polymerizes into thin non-helical filaments and occasionally into helical structures similar to F-actin. Furthermore, its crystalline structure is very similar to that of G-actin (in terms of its three-dimensional conformation), there are even similarities between the MreB protofilaments and F-actin. The bacterial cytoskeleton also contains the FtsZ proteins, which are similar to tubulin.

Bacteria therefore possess a cytoskeleton with homologous elements to actin (for example, MreB, AlfA, ParM, FtsA, and MamK), even though the amino acid sequence of these proteins diverges from that present in animal cells. However, such proteins have a high degree of structural similarity to eukaryotic actin. The highly dynamic microfilaments formed by the aggregation of MreB and ParM are essential to cell viability and they are involved in cell morphogenesis, chromosome segregation, and cell polarity. ParM is an actin homologue that is coded in a plasmid and it is involved in the regulation of plasmid DNA. ParMs from different bacterial plasmids can form astonishingly diverse helical structures comprising two or four strands to maintain faithful plasmid inheritance.

In archaea the homologue Ta0583 is even more similar to the eukaryotic actins.

== Molecular pathology ==
The majority of mammals possess six different actin genes. Of these, two code for the cytoskeleton (&quot;ACTB&quot; and &quot;ACTG1&quot;) while the other four are involved in skeletal striated muscle (&quot;ACTA1&quot;), smooth muscle tissue (&quot;ACTA2&quot;), intestinal muscles (&quot;ACTG2&quot;) and cardiac muscle (&quot;ACTC1&quot;). The actin in the cytoskeleton is involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of many infectious agents, including HIV. The vast majority of the mutations that affect actin are point mutations that have a dominant effect, with the exception of six mutations involved in nemaline myopathy. This is because in many cases the mutant of the actin monomer acts as a &quot;cap&quot; by preventing the elongation of F-actin.

=== Pathology associated with &quot;ACTA1&quot; ===
&quot;ACTA1&quot; is the gene that codes for the α-isoform of actin that is predominant in human skeletal striated muscles, although it is also expressed in heart muscle and in the thyroid gland. Its DNA sequence consists of seven exons that produce five known transcripts. The majority of these consist of point mutations causing substitution of amino acids. The mutations are in many cases associated with a phenotype that determines the severity and the course of the affliction.

The mutation alters the structure and function of skeletal muscles producing one of three forms of myopathy: type 3 nemaline myopathy, congenital myopathy with an excess of thin myofilaments (CM) and congenital myopathy with fibre type disproportion (CMFTD). Mutations have also been found that produce core myopathies. Although their phenotypes are similar, in addition to typical nemaline myopathy some specialists distinguish another type of myopathy called actinic nemaline myopathy. In the former, clumps of actin form instead of the typical rods. It is important to state that a patient can show more than one of these phenotypes in a biopsy. The most common symptoms consist of a typical facial morphology (myopathic facies), muscular weakness, a delay in motor development and respiratory difficulties. The course of the illness, its gravity, and the age at which it appears are all variable and overlapping forms of myopathy are also found. A symptom of nemaline myopathy is that &quot;nemaline rods&quot; appear in differing places in type 1 muscle fibres. These rods are non-pathognomonic structures that have a similar composition to the Z disks found in the sarcomere.

The pathogenesis of this myopathy is very varied. Many mutations occur in the region of actin&#x27;s indentation near to its nucleotide binding sites, while others occur in Domain 2, or in the areas where interaction occurs with associated proteins. This goes some way to explain the great variety of clumps that form in these cases, such as Nemaline or Intranuclear Bodies or Zebra Bodies. Changes in actin&#x27;s folding occur in nemaline myopathy as well as changes in its aggregation and there are also changes in the expression of other associated proteins. In some variants where intranuclear bodies are found the changes in the folding masks the nucleus&#x27;s protein exportation signal so that the accumulation of actin&#x27;s mutated form occurs in the cell nucleus. On the other hand, it appears that mutations to &quot;ACTA1&quot; that give rise to a CFTDM have a greater effect on sarcomeric function than on its structure. Recent investigations have tried to understand this apparent paradox, which suggests there is no clear correlation between the number of rods and muscular weakness. It appears that some mutations are able to induce a greater apoptosis rate in type II muscular fibres.

=== In smooth muscle ===
There are two isoforms that code for actins in the smooth muscle tissue:

&quot;ACTG2&quot; codes for the largest actin isoform, which has nine exons, one of which, the one located at the 5&#x27; end, is not translated. It is a γ-actin that is expressed in the enteric smooth muscle. No mutations to this gene have been found that correspond to pathologies, although microarrays have shown that this protein is more often expressed in cases that are resistant to chemotherapy using cisplatin.

&quot;ACTA2&quot; codes for an α-actin located in the smooth muscle, and also in vascular smooth muscle. It has been noted that the MYH11 mutation could be responsible for at least 14% of hereditary thoracic aortic aneurisms particularly Type 6. This is because the mutated variant produces an incorrect filamentary assembly and a reduced capacity for vascular smooth muscle contraction. Degradation of the aortic media has been recorded in these individuals, with areas of disorganization and hyperplasia as well as stenosis of the aorta&#x27;s vasa vasorum. The number of afflictions that the gene is implicated in is increasing. It has been related to Moyamoya disease and it seems likely that certain mutations in heterozygosis could confer a predisposition to many vascular pathologies, such as thoracic aortic aneurysm and ischaemic heart disease. The α-actin found in smooth muscles is also an interesting marker for evaluating the progress of liver cirrhosis.

=== In heart muscle ===
The &quot;ACTC1&quot; gene codes for the α-actin isoform present in heart muscle. It was first sequenced by Hamada and co-workers in 1982, when it was found that it is interrupted by five introns. It was the first of the six genes where alleles were found that were implicated in pathological processes.

A number of structural disorders associated with point mutations of this gene have been described that cause malfunctioning of the heart, such as Type 1R dilated cardiomyopathy and Type 11 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Certain defects of the atrial septum have been described recently that could also be related to these mutations.

Two cases of dilated cardiomyopathy have been studied involving a substitution of highly conserved amino acids belonging to the protein domains that bind and intersperse with the Z discs. This has led to the theory that the dilation is produced by a defect in the transmission of contractile force in the myocytes.

The mutations in ACTC1 are responsible for at least 5% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. The existence of a number of point mutations have also been found:
* Mutation E101K: changes of net charge and formation of a weak electrostatic link in the actomyosin-binding site.
* P166A: interaction zone between actin monomers.
* A333P: actin-myosin interaction zone.

Pathogenesis appears to involve a compensatory mechanism: the mutated proteins act like toxins with a dominant effect, decreasing the heart&#x27;s ability to contract causing abnormal mechanical behaviour such that the hypertrophy, that is usually delayed, is a consequence of the cardiac muscle&#x27;s normal response to stress.

Recent studies have discovered ACTC1 mutations that are implicated in two other pathological processes: Infantile idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy, and noncompaction of the left ventricular myocardium.

=== In cytoplasmatic actins ===
&quot;ACTB&quot; is a highly complex locus. A number of pseudogenes exist that are distributed throughout the genome, and its sequence contains six exons that can give rise to up to 21 different transcriptions by alternative splicing, which are known as the β-actins. Consistent with this complexity, its products are also found in a number of locations and they form part of a wide variety of processes (cytoskeleton, NuA4 histone-acyltransferase complex, cell nucleus) and in addition they are associated with the mechanisms of a great number of pathological processes (carcinomas, juvenile dystonia, infection mechanisms, nervous system malformations and tumour invasion, among others). A new form of actin has been discovered, kappa actin, which appears to substitute for β-actin in processes relating to tumours.

Three pathological processes have so far been discovered that are caused by a direct alteration in gene sequence:
* Hemangiopericytoma with t(7;12)(p22;q13)-translocations is a rare affliction, in which a translocational mutation causes the fusion of the &quot;ACTB&quot; gene over GLI1 in Chromosome 12.
* Juvenile onset dystonia is a rare degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system; in particular, it affects areas of the neocortex and thalamus, where rod-like eosinophilic inclusions are formed. The affected individuals represent a phenotype with deformities on the median line, sensory hearing loss and dystonia. It is caused by a point mutation in which the amino acid tryptophan replaces arginine in position 183. This alters actin&#x27;s interaction with the ADF/cofilin system, which regulates the dynamics of nerve cell cytoskeleton formation.
* A dominant point mutation has also been discovered that causes neutrophil granulocyte dysfunction and recurring infections. It appears that the mutation modifies the domain responsible for binding between profilin and other regulatory proteins. Actin&#x27;s affinity for profilin is greatly reduced in this allele.

The &quot;ACTG1&quot; locus codes for the cytosolic γ-actin protein that is responsible for the formation of cytoskeletal microfilaments. It contains six exons, giving rise to 22 different mRNAs, which produce four complete isoforms whose form of expression is probably dependent on the type of tissue they are found in. It also has two different DNA promoters. It has been noted that the sequences translated from this locus and from that of β-actin are very similar to the predicted ones, suggesting a common ancestral sequence that suffered duplication and genetic conversion.

In terms of pathology, it has been associated with processes such as amyloidosis, retinitis pigmentosa, infection mechanisms, kidney diseases, and various types of congenital hearing loss.

Six autosomal-dominant point mutations in the sequence have been found to cause various types of hearing loss, particularly sensorineural hearing loss linked to the DFNA 20/26 locus. It seems that they affect the stereocilia of the ciliated cells present in the inner ear&#x27;s Organ of Corti. β-actin is the most abundant protein found in human tissue, but it is not very abundant in ciliated cells, which explains the location of the pathology. On the other hand, it appears that the majority of these mutations affect the areas involved in linking with other proteins, particularly actomyosin. Some experiments have suggested that the pathological mechanism for this type of hearing loss relates to the F-actin in the mutations being more sensitive to cofilin than normal.

However, although there is no record of any case, it is known that γ-actin is also expressed in skeletal muscles, and although it is present in small quantities, model organisms have shown that its absence can give rise to myopathies.

=== Other pathological mechanisms ===
Some infectious agents use actin, especially cytoplasmic actin, in their life cycle. Two basic forms are present in bacteria:
* &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, some species of &quot;Rickettsia&quot;, &quot;Shigella flexneri&quot; and other intracellular germs escape from phagocytic vacuoles by coating themselves with a capsule of actin filaments. &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; and &quot;S. flexneri&quot; both generate a tail in the form of a &quot;comet tail&quot; that gives them mobility. Each species exhibits small differences in the molecular polymerization mechanism of their &quot;comet tails&quot;. Different displacement velocities have been observed, for example, with &quot;Listeria&quot; and &quot;Shigella&quot; found to be the fastest. Many experiments have demonstrated this mechanism &quot;in vitro&quot;. This indicates that the bacteria are not using a myosin-like protein motor, and it appears that their propulsion is acquired from the pressure exerted by the polymerization that takes place near to the microorganism&#x27;s cell wall. The bacteria have previously been surrounded by ABPs from the host, and as a minimum the covering contains Arp2/3 complex, Ena/VASP proteins, cofilin, a buffering protein and nucleation promoters, such as vinculin complex. Through these movements they form protrusions that reach the neighbouring cells, infecting them as well so that the immune system can only fight the infection through cell immunity. The movement could be caused by the modification of the curve and debranching of the filaments. Other species, such as &quot;Mycobacterium marinum&quot; and &quot;Burkholderia pseudomallei&quot;, are also capable of localized polymerization of cellular actin to aid their movement through a mechanism that is centered on the Arp2/3 complex. In addition the vaccine virus &quot;Vaccinia&quot; also uses elements of the actin cytoskeleton for its dissemination.
* &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; is able to form a protective biofilm in order to escape a host organism&#x27;s defences, especially white blood cells and antibiotics. The biofilm is constructed using DNA and actin filaments from the host organism.

In addition to the previously cited example, actin polymerization is stimulated in the initial steps of the internalization of some viruses, notably HIV, by, for example, inactivating the cofilin complex.

The role that actin plays in the invasion process of cancer cells has still not been determined.

In conditions of high lipoperoxidation, actin has been shown to be post-translationally modified by the lipoperoxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). This modification prevents the remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell motility. Additionally, another functional protein, coronin-1A, which stabilizes F-actin filaments, is also covalently modified by 4-HNE. These modifications may impair immune cell trans-endothelial migration or their phagocytic ability, potentially leading to a decreased immune response in diseases characterized by high oxidative stress, such as malaria, cancer, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, neurodegenerative diseases, and preeclampsia. 

==Applications==
Actin is used in scientific and technological laboratories as a track for molecular motors such as myosin (either in muscle tissue or outside it) and as a necessary component for cellular functioning. It can also be used as a diagnostic tool, as several of its anomalous variants are related to the appearance of specific pathologies.
*Nanotechnology. Actin-myosin systems act as molecular motors that permit the transport of vesicles and organelles throughout the cytoplasm. It is possible that actin could be applied to nanotechnology as its dynamic ability has been harnessed in a number of experiments including those carried out in acellular systems. The underlying idea is to use the microfilaments as tracks to guide molecular motors that can transport a given load. That is actin could be used to define a circuit along which a load can be transported in a more or less controlled and directed manner. In terms of general applications, it could be used for the directed transport of molecules for deposit in determined locations, which would permit the controlled assembly of nanostructures. These attributes could be applied to laboratory processes such as on &quot;lab-on-a-chip&quot;, in nanocomponent mechanics and in nanotransformers that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.
*Actin is used as an internal control in western blots to ascertain that equal amounts of protein have been loaded on each lane of the gel. In the blot example shown on the left side, 75 μg of total protein was loaded in each well. The blot was reacted with anti-β-actin antibody (for other details of the blot see the reference )

The use of actin as an internal control is based on the assumption that its expression is practically constant and independent of experimental conditions. By comparing the expression of the gene of interest to that of the actin, it is possible to obtain a relative quantity that can be compared between different experiments, whenever the expression of the latter is constant. It is worth pointing out that actin does not always have the desired stability in its gene expression.
*Health. Some alleles of actin cause diseases; for this reason techniques for their detection have been developed. In addition, actin can be used as an indirect marker in surgical pathology: it is possible to use variations in the pattern of its distribution in tissue as a marker of invasion in neoplasia, vasculitis, and other conditions. Further, due to actin&#x27;s close association with the apparatus of muscular contraction its levels in skeletal muscle diminishes when these tissues atrophy, it can therefore be used as a marker of this physiological process.
*Food technology. It is possible to determine the quality of certain processed foods, such as sausages, by quantifying the amount of actin present in the constituent meat. Traditionally, a method has been used that is based on the detection of 3-methylhistidine in hydrolyzed samples of these products, as this compound is present in actin and F-myosin&#x27;s heavy chain (both are major components of muscle). The generation of this compound in flesh derives from the methylation of histidine residues present in both proteins.

== History ==

Actin was first observed experimentally in 1887 by W.D. Halliburton, who extracted a protein from muscle that &#x27;coagulated&#x27; preparations of myosin that he called &quot;myosin-ferment&quot;. However, Halliburton was unable to further refine his findings, and the discovery of actin is credited instead to Brunó Ferenc Straub, a young biochemist working in Albert Szent-Györgyi&#x27;s laboratory at the Institute of Medical Chemistry at the University of Szeged, Hungary.

Following up on the discovery of Ilona Banga &amp; Szent-Györgyi in 1941 that the coagulation only occurs in some myosin extractions and was reversed upon the addition of ATP, Straub identified and purified actin from those myosin preparations that did coagulate. Building on Banga&#x27;s original extraction method, he developed a novel technique for extracting muscle protein that allowed him to isolate substantial amounts of relatively pure actin, published in 1942. Straub&#x27;s method is essentially the same as that used in laboratories today. Since Straub&#x27;s protein was necessary to activate the coagulation of myosin, it was dubbed &quot;actin&quot;. Realizing that Banga&#x27;s coagulating myosin preparations contained actin as well, Szent-Györgyi called the mixture of both proteins actomyosin.

The hostilities of World War II meant Szent-Gyorgyi was unable to publish his lab&#x27;s work in Western scientific journals. Actin therefore only became well known in the West in 1945, when their paper was published as a supplement to the &quot;Acta Physiologica Scandinavica&quot;. Straub continued to work on actin, and in 1950 reported that actin contains bound ATP and that, during polymerization of the protein into microfilaments, the nucleotide is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate (which remain bound to the microfilament). Straub suggested that the transformation of ATP-bound actin to ADP-bound actin played a role in muscular contraction. In fact, this is true only in smooth muscle, and was not supported through experimentation until 2001.

The amino acid sequencing of actin was completed by M. Elzinga and co-workers in 1973. The crystal structure of G-actin was solved in 1990 by Kabsch and colleagues. In the same year, a model for F-actin was proposed by Holmes and colleagues following experiments using co-crystallization with different proteins. The procedure of co-crystallization with different proteins was used repeatedly during the following years, until in 2001 the isolated protein was crystallized along with ADP. However, there is still no high-resolution X-ray structure of F-actin. The crystallization of G-actin was possible due to the use of a rhodamine conjugate that impedes polymerization by blocking the amino acid cys-374. Christine Oriol-Audit died in the same year that actin was first crystallized but she was the researcher that in 1977 first crystallized actin in the absence of Actin Binding Proteins (ABPs). However, the resulting crystals were too small for the available technology of the time.

Although no high-resolution model of actin&#x27;s filamentous form currently exists, in 2008 Sawaya&#x27;s team were able to produce a more exact model of its structure based on multiple crystals of actin dimers that bind in different places. This model has subsequently been further refined by Sawaya and Lorenz. Other approaches such as the use of cryo-electron microscopy and synchrotron radiation have recently allowed increasing resolution and better understanding of the nature of the interactions and conformational changes implicated in the formation of actin filaments.

== Research ==
=== Chemical inhibitors ===
A number of natural toxins that interfere with actin&#x27;s dynamics are widely used in research to study actin&#x27;s role in biology. Latrunculin – a toxin produced by sponges – binds to G-actin preventing it from joining microfilaments. Cytochalasin D – produced by certain fungi – serves as a capping factor, binding to the (+) end of a filament and preventing further addition of actin molecules. In contrast, the sponge toxin jasplakinolide promotes the nucleation of new actin filaments by binding and stabilzing pairs of actin molecules. Phalloidin – from the &quot;death cap&quot; mushroom &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot; – binds to adjacent actin molecules within the F-actin filament, stabilizing the filament and preventing its depolymerization.

Phalloidin is often labelled with fluorescent dyes to visualize actin filaments by fluorescence microscopy.

<text>Pinus mugo, known as dwarf mountain pine, mountain pine, scrub mountain pine, Swiss mountain pine, bog pine, creeping pine, or mugo pine, is a species of conifer, native to high elevation habitats from southwestern to Central Europe and Southeast Europe.

== Description ==
The tree has dark green leaves (&quot;needles&quot;) in pairs, long.

The cones are nut-brown, long.

== Taxonomy ==
There are three subspecies:
* Pinus mugo&quot; subsp. &quot;mugo — in the east and south of the range (southern &amp; eastern Alps, Balkan Peninsula), a low, shrubby, often multi-stemmed plant to tall with matt-textured symmetrical cones, which are thin-scaled.
* Pinus mugo&quot; subsp. &quot;uncinata — in the west and north of the range (from the Pyrenees northeast to Poland), a larger, usually single-stemmed tree to tall with glossy-textured asymmetrical cones, the scales of which are much thicker on the upper side.Some botanists treat the western subspecies as a separate species, Pinus uncinata, others as only a variety, &quot;P. mugo&quot; var. &quot;rostrata&quot;. This subspecies in the Pyrenees marks the alpine tree line or timberline, the edge of the habitat at which trees are capable of growing.
* Pinus mugo&quot; subsp. &quot;rotundata — hybrid subspecies, of the two subspecies above that intergrade extensively in the western Alps and northern Carpathians.

An old name for the species, &quot;, is still occasionally seen, and a typographical error &quot;mugho&quot;&quot; (first made in a prominent 18th-century encyclopedia) is still often repeated.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Pinus mugo&quot; is native to the subalpine zones of the Pyrenees, Alps, Ore Mountains, Carpathians, northern and central Apennines, and higher Balkan Peninsula mountainsRila, Pirin, Korab, Accursed Mountains, etc. It is usually found from , occasionally as low as in the north of the range in Germany and Poland, and as high as in the south of the range in Bulgaria and the Pyrenees. Also in Kosovo it is found in Bjeshkët e Nemuna National Park.

In Scandinavia, Finland and the Baltic region, &quot;P. mugo&quot; was introduced in the late 1700s and the 1800s, when it was planted in coastal regions for sand dune stabilization, and later as ornamental plants around residences. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, the species has naturalised and become invasive, displacing fragile dune and dune heath habitats. In Estonia and Lithuania &quot;P. mugo&quot; only occasionally naturalises outside plantations, sometimes establishing in raised bogs.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Pinus mugo&quot; is classed as a wilding conifer, and spreads as an invasive species in the high country of New Zealand, coastal Denmark, and other areas of Scandinavia.

== Cultivation ==
&quot;Pinus mugo&quot; is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant, for use as a small tree or shrub, planted in gardens and in larger pots and planters. It is also used in Japanese garden style landscapes, and for larger bonsai specimens. In Kosovo, its trunk is used as construction material for the vernacular architecture in the mountains called &quot;Bosonica&quot;.

=== Cultivars ===
Numerous cultivars have been selected. The following have been given the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
* &#x27;Humpy&#x27;
* &#x27;Kissen&#x27;
* &#x27;Mops&#x27;
* &#x27;Ophir&#x27;
Cultivars with seasonal changes in foliage color include &quot;Pinus mugo&quot; &#x27;Wintergold&#x27; and &quot;Pinus mugo&quot; &#x27;Ophir&#x27;.

== Uses ==
The mugo pine is used in cooking. The cones can be made into a syrup called &quot;pinecone syrup&quot;, &quot;pine cone syrup&quot;, or mugolio. Buds and young cones are harvested from the wild in the spring and left to dry in the sun over the summer and into autumn. The cones and buds gradually drip syrup, which is then boiled down to a concentrate and combined with sugar.
Alternatively, the pinecones can be macerated in sugar, fermented, and strained.

<text>The equation of time describes the discrepancy between two kinds of solar time. The two times that differ are the apparent solar time, which directly tracks the diurnal motion of the Sun, and mean solar time, which tracks a theoretical mean Sun with uniform motion along the celestial equator. Apparent solar time can be obtained by measurement of the current position (hour angle) of the Sun, as indicated (with limited accuracy) by a sundial. &quot;Mean&quot; solar time, for the same place, would be the time indicated by a steady clock set so that over the year its differences from apparent solar time would have a mean of zero.

The equation of time is the east or west component of the analemma, a curve representing the angular offset of the Sun from its mean position on the celestial sphere as viewed from Earth. The equation of time values for each day of the year, compiled by astronomical observatories, were widely listed in almanacs and ephemerides.

The equation of time can be approximated by a sum of two sine waves:

: formula_1 [minutes]

where: formula_2

where formula_3 represents the number of days since 1 January of the current year, formula_4.

== Concept ==
During a year the equation of time varies as shown on the graph; its change from one year to the next is slight. Apparent time, and the sundial, can be ahead (fast) by as much as 16 min 33 s (around 3 November), or behind (slow) by as much as 14 min 6 s (around 11 February). The equation of time has zeros near 15 April, 13 June, 1 September, and 25 December. Ignoring very slow changes in the Earth&#x27;s orbit and rotation, these events are repeated at the same times every tropical year. However, due to the non-integral number of days in a year, these dates can vary by a day or so from year to year. As an example of the inexactness of the dates, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory&#x27;s &quot;Multiyear Interactive Computer Almanac&quot; the equation of time was zero at 02:00 UT1 on 16 April 2011.

The graph of the equation of time is closely approximated by the sum of two sine curves, one with a period of a year and one with a period of half a year. The curves reflect two astronomical effects, each causing a different non-uniformity in the apparent daily motion of the Sun relative to the stars:

* the obliquity of the ecliptic (the plane of the Earth&#x27;s annual orbital motion around the Sun), which is inclined by about 23.44 degrees relative to the plane of the Earth&#x27;s equator; and
* the eccentricity of the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun, which is about 0.0167.

The equation of time vanishes only for a planet with zero axial tilt and zero orbital eccentricity. Two examples of planets with large equations of time are Mars and Uranus. On Mars the difference between sundial time and clock time can be as much as 50 minutes, due to the considerably greater eccentricity of its orbit. The planet Uranus, which has an extremely large axial tilt, has an equation of time that makes its days start and finish several hours earlier or later depending on where it is in its orbit.

== Notation ==
The United States Naval Observatory states &quot;the Equation of Time is the difference &quot;apparent solar time&quot; minus &quot;mean solar time&quot;&quot;, i.e. if the sun is ahead of the clock the sign is positive, and if the clock is ahead of the sun the sign is negative. The equation of time is shown in the upper graph above for a period of slightly more than a year. The lower graph (which covers exactly one calendar year) has the same absolute values but the sign is reversed as it shows how far the clock is ahead of the sun. Publications may use either format: in the English-speaking world, the former usage is the more common, but is not always followed. Anyone who makes use of a published table or graph should first check its sign usage. Often, there is a note or caption which explains it. Otherwise, the usage can be determined by knowing that, during the first three months of each year, the clock is ahead of the sundial. The mnemonic &quot;NYSS&quot; (pronounced &quot;nice&quot;), for &quot;new year, sundial slow&quot;, can be useful. Some published tables avoid the ambiguity by not using signs, but by showing phrases such as &quot;sundial fast&quot; or &quot;sundial slow&quot; instead.

== History ==

The phrase &quot;equation of time&quot; is derived from the medieval Latin &quot;aequātiō diērum&quot;, meaning &quot;equation of days&quot; or &quot;difference of days&quot;. The word &quot;equation&quot; is used in the medieval sense of &quot;reconciliation of a difference&quot;. The word &quot;aequātiō&quot; (and Middle English &quot;equation&quot;) was used in medieval astronomy to tabulate the difference between an observed value and the expected value (as in the equation of the centre, the equation of the equinoxes, the equation of the epicycle). Gerald J. Toomer uses the medieval term &quot;equation&quot;, from the Latin &quot;aequātiō&quot; (equalization or adjustment), for Ptolemy&#x27;s difference between the mean solar time and the apparent solar time. Johannes Kepler&#x27;s definition of the equation is &quot;the difference between the number of degrees and minutes of the mean anomaly and the degrees and minutes of the corrected anomaly.&quot;

The difference between apparent solar time and mean time was recognized by astronomers since antiquity, but prior to the invention of accurate mechanical clocks in the mid-17th century, sundials were the only reliable timepieces, and apparent solar time was the generally accepted standard. Mean time did not supplant apparent time in national almanacs and ephemerides until the early 19th century. 

=== Early astronomy ===
The irregular daily movement of the Sun was known to the Babylonians.

Book III of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; (2nd century) is primarily concerned with the Sun&#x27;s anomaly, and he tabulated the equation of time in his &quot;Handy Tables&quot;. Ptolemy discusses the correction needed to convert the meridian crossing of the Sun to mean solar time and takes into consideration the nonuniform motion of the Sun along the ecliptic and the meridian correction for the Sun&#x27;s ecliptic longitude. He states the maximum correction is  time-degrees or of an hour (Book III, chapter 9). However he did not consider the effect to be relevant for most calculations since it was negligible for the slow-moving luminaries and only applied it for the fastest-moving luminary, the Moon.

Based on Ptolemy&#x27;s discussion in the &quot;Almagest&quot;, values for the equation of time (Arabic &quot;taʿdīl al-ayyām bi layālayhā&quot;) were standard for the tables (&quot;zij&quot;) in the works of medieval Islamic astronomy.

=== Early modern period ===
A description of apparent and mean time was given by Nevil Maskelyne in the &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; for 1767: &quot;Apparent Time is that deduced immediately from the Sun, whether from the Observation of his passing the Meridian, or from his observed Rising or Setting. This Time is different from that shewn by Clocks and Watches well regulated at Land, which is called equated or mean Time.&quot; He went on to say that, at sea, the apparent time found from observation of the Sun must be corrected by the equation of time, if the observer requires the mean time.

The right time was originally considered to be that which was shown by a sundial. When good mechanical clocks were introduced, they agreed with sundials only near four dates each year, so the equation of time was used to &quot;correct&quot; their readings to obtain sundial time. Some clocks, called equation clocks, included an internal mechanism to perform this &quot;correction&quot;. Later, as clocks became the dominant good timepieces, uncorrected clock time, i.e., &quot;mean time&quot;, became the accepted standard. The readings of sundials, when they were used, were then, and often still are, corrected with the equation of time, used in the reverse direction from previously, to obtain clock time. Many sundials, therefore, have tables or graphs of the equation of time engraved on them to allow the user to make this correction.

The equation of time was used historically to . Between the invention of accurate clocks in 1656 and the advent of commercial time distribution services around 1900, there were several common land-based ways to set clocks. A sundial was read and corrected with the table or graph of the equation of time.

If a transit instrument was available or accuracy was important, the sun&#x27;s transit across the meridian (the moment the sun appears to be due south or north of the observer, known as its culmination) was noted; the clock was then set to noon and offset by the number of minutes given by the equation of time for that date. A third method did not use the equation of time; instead, it used observations to give sidereal time, exploiting the relationship between sidereal time and mean solar time. The more accurate methods were also precursors to finding the observer&#x27;s longitude in relation to a prime meridian, such as in geodesy on land and celestial navigation on the sea.

The first tables to give the equation of time in an essentially correct way were published in 1665 by Christiaan Huygens. Huygens, following the tradition of Ptolemy and medieval astronomers in general, set his values for the equation of time so as to make all values positive throughout the year. This meant that any clock being set to mean time by Huygens&#x27;s tables was consistently about 15 minutes slow compared to today&#x27;s mean time.

Another set of tables was published in 1672–73 by John Flamsteed, who later became the first Astronomer Royal of the new Royal Greenwich Observatory. These appear to have been the first essentially correct tables that gave today&#x27;s meaning of Mean Time (previously, as noted above, the sign of the equation was always positive and it was set at zero when the apparent time of sunrise was earliest relative to the clock time of sunrise). Flamsteed adopted the convention of tabulating and naming the correction in the sense that it was to be applied to the apparent time to give mean time.

The equation of time, correctly based on the two major components of the Sun&#x27;s irregularity of apparent motion, was not generally adopted until after Flamsteed&#x27;s tables of 1672–73, published with the posthumous edition of the works of Jeremiah Horrocks.

Robert Hooke (1635–1703), who mathematically analyzed the universal joint, was the first to note that the geometry and mathematical description of the (non-secular) equation of time and the universal joint were identical, and proposed the use of a universal joint in the construction of a &quot;mechanical sundial&quot;.

=== 18th and early 19th centuries ===

The corrections in Flamsteed&#x27;s tables of 1672–1673 and 1680 gave mean time computed essentially correctly and without need for further offset. But the numerical values in tables of the equation of time have somewhat changed since then, owing to three factors:

* General improvements in accuracy that came from refinements in astronomical measurement techniques,
* Slow intrinsic changes in the equation of time, occurring as a result of small long-term changes in the Earth&#x27;s obliquity and eccentricity (affecting, for instance, the distance and dates of perihelion), and
* The inclusion of small sources of additional variation in the apparent motion of the Sun, unknown in the 17th century but discovered from the 18th century onwards, including the effects of the Moon (See barycentre), Venus and Jupiter.

From 1767 to 1833, the British &quot;Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris&quot; tabulated the equation of time in the sense &#x27;add or subtract (as directed) the number of minutes and seconds stated to or from the apparent time to obtain the mean time&#x27;. Times in the Almanac were in apparent solar time, because time aboard ship was most often determined by observing the Sun. This operation would be performed in the unusual case that the mean solar time of an observation was needed. In the issues since 1834, all times have been in mean solar time, because by then the time aboard ship was increasingly often determined by marine chronometers. The instructions were consequently to add or subtract (as directed) the number of minutes stated to or from the mean time to obtain the apparent time. So now addition corresponded to the equation being positive and subtraction corresponded to it being negative.

As the apparent daily movement of the Sun is one revolution per day, that is 360° every 24 hours, and the Sun itself appears as a disc of about 0.5° in the sky, simple sundials can be read to a maximum accuracy of about one minute. Since the equation of time has a range of about 33 minutes, the difference between sundial time and clock time cannot be ignored. In addition to the equation of time, one also has to apply corrections due to one&#x27;s distance from the local time zone meridian and summer time, if any.

The tiny increase of the mean solar day due to the slowing down of the Earth&#x27;s rotation, by about 2 ms per day per century, which currently accumulates up to about 1 second every year, is not taken into account in traditional definitions of the equation of time, as it is imperceptible at the accuracy level of sundials.

== Major components ==

=== Eccentricity of the Earth&#x27;s orbit ===
The Earth revolves around the Sun. As seen from Earth, the Sun appears to revolve once around the Earth through the background stars in one year. If the Earth orbited the Sun with a constant speed, in a circular orbit in a plane perpendicular to the Earth&#x27;s axis, then the Sun would culminate every day at exactly the same time, and be a perfect time keeper (except for the very small effect of the slowing rotation of the Earth). But the orbit of the Earth is an ellipse not centered on the Sun, and its speed varies between 30.287 and 29.291 km/s, according to Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion, and its angular speed also varies, and thus the Sun appears to move faster (relative to the background stars) at perihelion (currently around 3 January) and slower at aphelion a half year later.

At these extreme points, this effect varies the apparent solar day by 7.9 s/day from its mean. Consequently, the smaller daily differences on other days in speed are cumulative until these points, reflecting how the planet accelerates and decelerates compared to the mean.

As a result, the eccentricity of the Earth&#x27;s orbit contributes a periodic variation which is (in the first-order approximation) a sine wave with:

* amplitude: 7.66 minutes
* period: one year
* zero points: perihelion (at the beginning of January) and aphelion (beginning of July)
* extreme values: early April (negative) and early October (positive)

This component of the EoT is represented by aforementioned factor &quot;a&quot;:
: formula_5

=== Obliquity of the ecliptic ===
Even if the Earth&#x27;s orbit were circular, the perceived motion of the Sun along our celestial equator would still not be uniform. This is a consequence of the tilt of the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis with respect to the plane of its orbit, or equivalently, the tilt of the ecliptic (the path the Sun appears to take in the celestial sphere) with respect to the celestial equator. The projection of this motion onto our celestial equator, along which &quot;clock time&quot; is measured, is a maximum at the solstices, when the yearly movement of the Sun is parallel to the equator (causing amplification of perceived speed) and yields mainly a change in right ascension. It is a minimum at the equinoxes, when the Sun&#x27;s apparent motion is more sloped and yields more change in declination, leaving less for the component in right ascension, which is the only component that affects the duration of the solar day. A practical illustration of obliquity is that the daily shift of the shadow cast by the Sun in a sundial even on the equator is smaller close to the solstices and greater close to the equinoxes. If this effect operated alone, then days would be up to 24 hours and 20.3 seconds long (measured solar noon to solar noon) near the solstices, and as much as 20.3 seconds shorter than 24 hours near the equinoxes.

In the figure on the right, we can see the monthly variation of the apparent slope of the plane of the ecliptic at solar midday as seen from Earth. This variation is due to the apparent precession of the rotating Earth through the year, as seen from the Sun at solar midday.

In terms of the equation of time, the inclination of the ecliptic results in the contribution of a sine wave variation with:

* amplitude: 9.87 minutes
* period: 1/2 year
* zero points: equinoxes and solstices
* extreme values: beginning of February and August (negative) and beginning of May and November (positive).

This component of the EoT is represented by the aforementioned factor &quot;b&quot;:

formula_6

== Secular effects ==

The two above mentioned factors have different wavelengths, amplitudes and phases, so their combined contribution is an irregular wave. At epoch 2000 these are the values (in minutes and seconds with UT dates):
On shorter timescales (thousands of years) the shifts in the dates of equinox and perihelion will be more important. The former is caused by precession, and shifts the equinox backwards compared to the stars. But it can be ignored in the current discussion as our Gregorian calendar is constructed in such a way as to keep the vernal equinox date at 20 March (at least at sufficient accuracy for our aim here). The shift of the perihelion is forwards, about 1.7 days every century. In 1246 the perihelion occurred on 22 December, the day of the solstice, so the two contributing waves had common zero points and the equation of time curve was symmetrical: in &quot;Astronomical Algorithms&quot; Meeus gives February and November extrema of 15 m 39 s and May and July ones of 4 m 58 s. Before then the February minimum was larger than the November maximum, and the May maximum larger than the July minimum. In fact, in years before −1900 (1901 BCE) the May maximum was larger than the November maximum. In the year −2000 (2001 BCE) the May maximum was +12 minutes and a couple seconds while the November maximum was just less than 10 minutes. The secular change is evident when one compares a current graph of the equation of time (see below) with one from 2000 years ago, e.g., one constructed from the data of Ptolemy.

== Practical use ==

If the gnomon (the shadow-casting object) is not an edge but a point (e.g., a hole in a plate), the shadow (or spot of light) will trace out a curve during the course of a day. If the shadow is cast on a plane surface, this curve will be a conic section (usually a hyperbola), since the circle of the Sun&#x27;s motion together with the gnomon point define a cone. At the spring and autumnal equinoxes, the cone degenerates into a plane and the hyperbola into a line. With a different hyperbola for each day, hour marks can be put on each hyperbola which include any necessary corrections. Unfortunately, each hyperbola corresponds to two different days, one in each half of the year, and these two days will require different corrections. A convenient compromise is to draw the line for the &quot;mean time&quot; and add a curve showing the exact position of the shadow points at noon during the course of the year. This curve will take the form of a figure eight and is known as an analemma. By comparing the analemma to the mean noon line, the amount of correction to be applied generally on that day can be determined.

The equation of time is used not only in connection with sundials and similar devices, but also for many applications of solar energy. Machines such as solar trackers and heliostats have to move in ways that are influenced by the equation of time.

Civil time is the local mean time for a meridian that often passes near the center of the time zone, and may possibly be further altered by daylight saving time. When the apparent solar time that corresponds to a given civil time is to be found, the difference in longitude between the site of interest and the time zone meridian, daylight saving time, and the equation of time must all be considered.

== Calculation ==

The equation of time is obtained from a published table, or a graph. For dates in the past such tables are produced from historical measurements, or by calculation; for future dates, of course, tables can only be calculated. In devices such as computer-controlled heliostats the computer is often programmed to calculate the equation of time. The calculation can be numerical or analytical. The former are based on numerical integration of the differential equations of motion, including all significant gravitational and relativistic effects. The results are accurate to better than 1 second and are the basis for modern almanac data. The latter are based on a solution that includes only the gravitational interaction between the Sun and Earth, simpler than but not as accurate as the former. Its accuracy can be improved by including small corrections.

The following discussion describes a reasonably accurate (agreeing with almanac data to within 3 seconds over a wide range of years) algorithm for the equation of time that is well known to astronomers. It also shows how to obtain a simple approximate formula (accurate to within 1 minute over a large time interval), that can be easily evaluated with a calculator and provides the simple explanation of the phenomenon that was used previously in this article.

=== Mathematical description ===
The precise definition of the equation of time is:

: formula_7

The quantities occurring in this equation are:

* EOT, the time difference between apparent solar time and mean solar time;
* GHA, the Greenwich Hour Angle of the apparent (actual) Sun;
* GMHA = Universal Time − Offset, the Greenwich Mean Hour Angle of the mean (fictitious) Sun.

Here time and angle are quantities that are related by factors such as: 2 radians = 360° = 1 day = 24 hours. The difference, EOT, is measurable since GHA is an angle that can be measured and Universal Time, UT, is a scale for the measurement of time. The offset by = 180° = 12 hours from UT is needed because UT is zero at mean midnight while GMHA = 0 at mean noon. Universal Time is discontinuous at mean midnight so another quantity day number , an integer, is required in order to form the continuous quantity time : . Both GHA and GMHA, like all physical angles, have a mathematical, but not a physical discontinuity at their respective (apparent and mean) noon. Despite the mathematical discontinuities of its components, EOT is defined as a continuous function by adding (or subtracting) 24 hours in the small time interval between the discontinuities in GHA and GMHA.

According to the definitions of the angles on the celestial sphere (see hour angle) where:
* GAST is the Greenwich apparent sidereal time (the angle between the apparent vernal equinox and the meridian in the plane of the equator). This is a known function of UT.
* is the right ascension of the apparent Sun (the angle between the apparent vernal equinox and the actual Sun in the plane of the equator).

On substituting into the equation of time, it is
: formula_8
Like the formula for GHA above, one can write , where the last term is the right ascension of the mean Sun. The equation is often written in these terms as
: formula_9
where . In this formulation a measurement or calculation of EOT at a certain value of time depends on a measurement or calculation of at that time. Both and vary from 0 to 24 hours during the course of a year. The former has a discontinuity at a time that depends on the value of UT, while the latter has its at a slightly later time. As a consequence, when calculated this way EOT has two, artificial, discontinuities. They can both be removed by subtracting 24 hours from the value of EOT in the small time interval after the discontinuity in and before the one in . The resulting EOT is a continuous function of time.

Another definition, denoted to distinguish it from EOT, is
: formula_10
Here , is the Greenwich mean sidereal time (the angle between the mean vernal equinox and the mean Sun in the plane of the equator). Therefore, GMST is an approximation to GAST (and is an approximation to EOT); eqeq is called the equation of the equinoxes and is due to the wobbling, or nutation of the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation about its precessional motion. Since the amplitude of the nutational motion is only about 1.2 s (18″ of longitude) the difference between EOT and can be ignored unless one is interested in subsecond accuracy.

A third definition, denoted to distinguish it from EOT and , and now called the Equation of Ephemeris Time (prior to the distinction that is now made between EOT, , and the latter was known as the equation of time) is
: formula_11
here is the ecliptic longitude of the mean Sun (the angle from the mean vernal equinox to the mean Sun in the plane of the ecliptic).

The difference is 1.3 s from 1960 to 2040. Therefore, over this restricted range of years is an approximation to EOT whose error is in the range 0.1 to 2.5 s depending on the longitude correction in the equation of the equinoxes; for many purposes, for example correcting a sundial, this accuracy is more than good enough.

=== Right ascension calculation ===

The right ascension, and hence the equation of time, can be calculated from Newton&#x27;s two-body theory of celestial motion, in which the bodies (Earth and Sun) describe elliptical orbits about their common mass center. Using this theory, the equation of time becomes:

: formula_12

where the new angles that appear are:

* , is the mean anomaly, the angle from the periapsis of the elliptical orbit to the mean Sun; its range is from 0 to 2 as increases from to ;
* =  days is the length of time in an anomalistic year: the time interval between two successive passages of the periapsis;
* , is the ecliptic longitude of the periapsis;
* is dynamical time, the independent variable in the theory. Here it is taken to be identical with the continuous time based on UT (see above), but in more precise calculations (of or EOT) the small difference between them must be accounted for as well as the distinction between UT1 and UTC.
* is the value of at the periapsis.

To complete the calculation three additional angles are required:

* , the Sun&#x27;s eccentric anomaly (note that this is different from );
* , the Sun&#x27;s true anomaly;
* , the Sun&#x27;s true longitude on the ecliptic.

All these angles are shown in the figure on the right, which shows the celestial sphere and the Sun&#x27;s elliptical orbit seen from the Earth (the same as the Earth&#x27;s orbit seen from the Sun). In this figure is the obliquity, while is the eccentricity of the ellipse.

Now given a value of , one can calculate by means of the following well-known procedure:

First, given , calculate from Kepler&#x27;s equation:

: formula_13

Although this equation cannot be solved exactly in closed form, values of can be obtained from infinite (power or trigonometric) series, graphical, or numerical methods. Alternatively, note that for , , and by iteration:

: formula_14

This approximation can be improved, for small , by iterating again:

: formula_15,

and continued iteration produces successively higher order terms of the power series expansion in . For small values of (much less than 1) two or three terms of the series give a good approximation for ; the smaller , the better the approximation.

Next, knowing , calculate the true anomaly from an elliptical orbit relation

:formula_16

The correct branch of the multiple valued function to use is the one that makes a continuous function of starting from . Thus for use , and for use . At the specific value for which the argument of is infinite, use . Here is the principal branch, ; the function that is returned by calculators and computer applications. Alternatively, this function can be expressed in terms of its Taylor series in , the first three terms of which are:

: formula_17.

For small this approximation (or even just the first two terms) is a good one. Combining the approximation for with this one for produces:

: formula_18.

The relation is called the equation of the center; the expression written here is a second-order approximation in . For the small value of that characterises the Earth&#x27;s orbit this gives a very good approximation for .

Next, knowing , calculate from its definition:

: formula_19

The value of varies non-linearly with because the orbit is elliptical and not circular. From the approximation for :

: formula_20.

Finally, knowing calculate from a relation for the right triangle on the celestial sphere shown above

: formula_21

Note that the quadrant of is the same as that of , therefore reduce to the range 0 to 2 and write

: formula_22,

where is 0 if is in quadrant 1, it is 1 if is in quadrants 2 or 3 and it is 2 if is in quadrant 4. For the values at which tan is infinite, .

Although approximate values for can be obtained from truncated Taylor series like those for , it is more efficacious to use the equation

: formula_23

where . Note that for , and iterating twice:

: formula_24.

=== Final calculation ===

The equation of time is obtained by substituting the result of the right ascension calculation into an equation of time formula. Here is used; in part because small corrections (of the order of 1 second), that would justify using , are not included, and in part because the goal is to obtain a simple analytical expression. Using two-term approximations for and allows to be written as an explicit expression of two terms, which is designated because it is a first order approximation in and in .

This equation was first derived by Milne, who wrote it in terms of . The numerical values written here result from using the orbital parameter values, = , = ° =  radians, and = ° =  radians that correspond to the epoch 1 January 2000 at 12 noon UT1. When evaluating the numerical expression for as given above, a calculator must be in radian mode to obtain correct values because the value of in the argument of the second term is written there in radians. Higher order approximations can also be written, but they necessarily have more terms. For example, the second order approximation in both and consists of five terms
: 2) formula_26
This approximation has the potential for high accuracy, however, in order to achieve it over a wide range of years, the parameters , , and must be allowed to vary with time. This creates additional calculational complications. Other approximations have been proposed, for example, which uses the first order equation of the center but no other approximation to determine , and which uses the second order equation of the center.

The time variable, , can be written either in terms of , the number of days past perihelion, or , the number of days past a specific date and time (epoch):
: 3) formula_27 days formula_28 days formula_29
: 4) formula_30

Here is the value of at the chosen date and time. For the values given here, in radians, is that measured for the actual Sun at the epoch, 1 January 2000 at 12 noon UT1, and is the number of days past that epoch. At periapsis , so solving gives = . This puts the periapsis on 4 January 2000 at 00:11:41 while the actual periapsis is, according to results from the &quot;Multiyear Interactive Computer Almanac&quot; (abbreviated as MICA), on 3 January 2000 at 05:17:30. This large discrepancy happens because the difference between the orbital radius at the two locations is only 1 part in a million; in other words, radius is a very weak function of time near periapsis. As a practical matter this means that one cannot get a highly accurate result for the equation of time by using and adding the actual periapsis date for a given year. However, high accuracy can be achieved by using the formulation in terms of .

When , &quot;M&quot; is greater than 2 and one must subtract a multiple of 2 (that depends on the year) from it to bring it into the range 0 to 2. Likewise for years prior to 2000 one must add multiples of 2. For example, for the year 2010, varies from on 1 January at noon to on 31 December at noon; the corresponding values are and and are reduced to the range 0 to 2 by subtracting 10 and 11 times 2 respectively.

One can always write:

5) 

where:

* = number of days from the epoch to noon on 1 January of the desired year
* (365 if the calculation is for a leap year).

The resulting equation for years after 2000, written as a sum of two terms, given 1), 4) and 5), is:

formula_31

formula_32

6) formula_33 [minutes]

In plain text format:

7) EoT =  -7.659sin(6.24004077 + 0.01720197(365*(y-2000) + d)) + 9.863sin( 2 (6.24004077 + 0.01720197 (365*(y-2000) + d)) + 3.5932 ) [minutes]

Term &quot;a&quot; represents the contribution of eccentricty, term &quot;b&quot; represents contribution of obliquity.

The result of the computations is usually given as either a set of tabular values, or a graph of the equation of time as a function of . A comparison of plots of , , and results from MICA all for the year 2000 is shown in the figure. The plot of is seen to be close to the results produced by MICA, the absolute error, , is less than 1 minute throughout the year; its largest value is 43.2 seconds and occurs on day 276 (3 October). The plot of is indistinguishable from the results of MICA, the largest absolute error between the two is 2.46 s on day 324 (20 November).

==== Continuity ====

For the choice of the appropriate branch of the relation with respect to function continuity a modified version of the arctangent function is helpful. It brings in previous knowledge about the expected value by a parameter. The modified arctangent function is defined as:
: formula_34.
It produces a value that is as close to as possible. The function rounds to the nearest integer.

Applying this yields:
: formula_35.
The parameter arranges here to set to the zero nearest value which is the desired one.

=== Secular change ===

The difference between the MICA and results was checked every 5 years over the range from 1960 to 2040. In every instance the maximum absolute error was less than 3 s; the largest difference, 2.91 s, occurred on 22 May 1965 (day 141). However, in order to achieve this level of accuracy over this range of years it is necessary to account for the secular change in the orbital parameters with time. The equations that describe this variation are:
:formula_36
According to these relations, in 100 years ( = ), increases by about 0.5% (1.7°), decreases by about 0.25%, and decreases by about 0.05%.

As a result, the number of calculations required for any of the higher-order approximations of the equation of time requires a computer to complete them, if one wants to achieve their inherent accuracy over a wide range of time. In this event it is no more difficult to evaluate using a computer than any of its approximations.

In all this note that as written above is easy to evaluate, even with a calculator, is accurate enough (better than 1 minute over the 80-year range) for correcting sundials, and has the nice physical explanation as the sum of two terms, one due to obliquity and the other to eccentricity that was used previously in the article. This is not true either for considered as a function of or for any of its higher-order approximations.

=== Alternative calculation ===

Another procedure for calculating the equation of time can be done as follows. Angles are in degrees; the conventional order of operations applies.
where is the Earth&#x27;s mean angular orbital velocity in degrees per day, a.k.a. &quot;the mean daily motion&quot;.

: formula_37
where is the date, counted in days starting at 1 on 1 January (i.e. the days part of the ordinal date in the year). 9 is the approximate number of days from the December solstice to 31 December. is the angle the Earth &quot;would&quot; move on its orbit at its average speed from the December solstice to date .

: formula_38
 is the angle the Earth moves from the solstice to date , including a first-order correction for the Earth&#x27;s orbital eccentricity, 0.0167 . The number 3 is the approximate number of days from 31 December to the current date of the Earth&#x27;s perihelion. This expression for can be simplified by combining constants to:
: formula_39.

: formula_40

Here, is the difference between the angle moved at mean speed, and at the angle at the corrected speed projected onto the equatorial plane, and divided by 180° to get the difference in &quot;half-turns&quot;. The value 23.44° is the tilt of the Earth&#x27;s axis (&quot;obliquity&quot;). The subtraction gives the conventional sign to the equation of time. For any given value of , (sometimes written as ) has multiple values, differing from each other by integer numbers of half turns. The value generated by a calculator or computer may not be the appropriate one for this calculation. This may cause to be wrong by an integer number of half-turns. The excess half-turns are removed in the next step of the calculation to give the equation of time:

: formula_41 minutes

The expression means the &quot;nearest integer&quot; to . On a computer, it can be programmed, for example, as . Its value is 0, 1, or 2 at different times of the year. Subtracting it leaves a small positive or negative fractional number of half turns, which is multiplied by 720, the number of minutes (12 hours) that the Earth takes to rotate one half turn relative to the Sun, to get the equation of time.

Compared with published values, this calculation has a root mean square error of only 3.7 s. The greatest error is 6.0 s. This is much more accurate than the approximation described above, but not as accurate as the elaborate calculation.

==== Solar declination ====
The value of in the above calculation is an accurate value for the Sun&#x27;s ecliptic longitude (shifted by 90°), so the solar declination becomes readily available:

: formula_42

which is accurate to within a fraction of a degree.

<doc id="438950" wikidata="Q263592" url="?curid=438950" title="Kassia">
<text>Kassia, Cassia or Kassiani (, ; – before 865) was a Byzantine-Greek composer, hymnographer and poet. She holds a unique place in Byzantine music as the only known woman whose music appears in the Byzantine liturgy. Approximately fifty of her hymns are extant, most of which are stichera, though at least 26 have uncertain attribution. The authenticity issues are due to many hymns being anonymous, and others ascribed to different authors in different manuscripts. She was an abbess of a convent in the west of Constantinople.

Additionally, many epigrams and gnomic verses are attributed to her, at least 261. Kassia is notable as one of at least two women in the middle Byzantine period known to have written in their own names, the other being Anna Comnena. Like her predecessors Romanos the Melodist and Andrew of Crete, the earliest surviving manuscripts of her works are dated centuries after her lifetime.

==Name==
Her name is a feminine Greek form of the Latin name &quot;Cassius&quot;. It is variously spelled Κασσιανή (contemporary pronunciation ), Κασ(σ)ία (&quot;Kas[s]ia&quot;), Εικασία (&quot;Eikasia&quot;), Ικασία (&quot;Ikasia&quot;), &quot;Kassiani&quot;, &quot;Cas[s]ia&quot;, &quot;Cassiane&quot;, &quot;Kassiana&quot;. Modern English-language references to her as a composer generally use the name &quot;Kassia,&quot; while references to her religious life tend to use Kassia or Kassiani.

==Life==

Kassia was born between 805 and 810 in Constantinople into a wealthy family and grew to be exceptionally beautiful and intelligent. Three Byzantine chroniclers, Pseudo-Symeon the Logothete, George the Monk (a.k.a. George the Sinner) and Leo the Grammarian, claim that she was a participant in the &quot;bride show&quot; (the means by which Byzantine princes/emperors sometimes chose a bride, by giving a golden apple to his choice) organized for the young bachelor Theophilos by his stepmother, the Empress Dowager Euphrosyne. Smitten by Kassia&#x27;s beauty, the young emperor approached her and said: &quot;Through a woman [came forth] the baser [things],&quot; referring to the sin and suffering coming as a result of Eve&#x27;s transgression. Kassia promptly responded, &quot;And through a woman [came forth] the better [things],&quot; referring to the hope of salvation resulting from the Incarnation of Christ through the Virgin Mary. According to tradition, the dialogue was:
&quot;-.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&quot;-.&quot; 
Unsatisfied with her response, Theophilos rejected her and chose Theodora as his wife.

By 843, Kassia had founded a convent in the west of Constantinople, near the Constantinian Walls, and became its first abbess. Although many scholars attribute this to bitterness at having failed to marry Theophilos and to become empress, a letter from Theodore the Studite indicates that she had other motivations for wanting a monastic life. It had a close relationship with the nearby monastery of Stoudios, which was to play a central role in re-editing the Byzantine liturgical books in the 9th and 10th centuries, thus ensuring the survival of her work (Kurt Sherry, p. 56). However, since the monastic life was a common vocation in her day, religious zeal is as likely a motive as either depression or aspiration for artistic renown.

Emperor Theophilos was a fierce iconoclast, and any residual feelings he may have had for Kassia did not preserve her from the imperial policy of persecution for her defence of the veneration of icons. Among other things, she was subjected to scourging with a lash. In spite of this, she remained outspoken in defence of the Orthodox Faith, at one point saying, &quot;I hate silence when it is time to speak.&quot;

After the death of Theophilos in 842 his young son Michael III became Eastern Roman Emperor, with Empress Theodora acting as Regent. Together they ended the second iconoclastic period (814-842); peace was restored to the empire.

Kassia traveled to Italy briefly, but eventually settled on the Greek Island of Kasos, where she died sometime between 867 and 890. In the city of Panaghia, there is a church where Kassia&#x27;s tomb/reliquary may be found.

==Works==
===Overview===
Kassiani wrote many hymns which are still used in the Byzantine liturgy to this day. She became known to the great Theodore the Studite, while she was still a young girl, and he was impressed by her learning and literary style. She not only wrote spiritual poetry, but composed music to accompany it. She is regarded as an &quot;exceptional and rare phenomenon&quot; among composers of her day At least twenty-three genuine hymns are ascribed to her. Her &quot;oeuvre&quot; as a whole demonstrates influence from classical Greek literature, which she studied early in life.

===Sacred music===
====Hymn of Kassia====
The most famous of her compositions is the eponymous Hymn of Kassia (also known as the &quot;Troparion of Kassiani&quot;), which is chanted each year for Great and Holy Wednesday as a doxastichon occurring at the end of the aposticha of orthros and the lamp-lighting psalms of the Presanctified Liturgy.

Tradition says that in his later years the Emperor Theophilus, still in love with her, wished to see her one more time before he died, so he rode to the monastery where she resided. Kassia was alone in her cell, writing her &quot;Hymn&quot; when she realized that the commotion she heard was because the imperial retinue had arrived. She was still in love with him but was now devoted to God and hid away because she did not want to let her old passion overcome her monastic vow. She left the unfinished hymn on the table. Theophilus found her cell and entered it alone. He looked for her but she was not there; she was hiding in a closet, watching him. Theophilus, overcome with sadness, cried and regretted that moment of pride when he rejected such a beautiful and intellectual woman; then he noticed the papers on the table and read them. When he had finished reading, he sat and added one line to the hymn; then he left. The line attributed to the Emperor is the line &quot;those feet whose sound Eve heard at dusk in Paradise and hid herself for fear.&quot; Legend says that as he was leaving he noticed Kassia in the closet but did not speak to her, out of respect for her wished privacy. Kassia emerged when the emperor was gone, read what he had written and finished the hymn.

The music for the hymn is slow, sorrowful and plaintive, lasting about ten to twenty minutes, depending on tempo and style of execution. It requires a very wide vocal range, and is considered one of the most demanding pieces — if not &quot;the&quot; most demanding one — of solo Byzantine chant, and cantors take great pride in delivering it well. It is also sung by choirs in unison, often underpinned by Byzantine vocal bass drone.

====Other hymns====
Among the other hymns she composed are the following:

*The Doxastichon chanted at the Vesperal Divine Liturgy on Christmas Eve 
*Numerous hymns in honor of saints found in the Menaion (fixed cycle of the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar), such as Feast of the Nativity of the Forerunner, 24 June. 
* Among her hymns in the Triodion (liturgical book used during Great Lent) are the irmoi for the Matins Canons of Great and Holy Thursday and Great and Holy Saturday.
* Her longest composition is a Canon for the Departed, consisting of 32 strophes, to be chanted at a Parastas (memorial services).

===Secular writings===
This poem by Kassia reflects the prevailing tensions and biases within the Byzantine Roman Empire against citizens of non-Roman origins, particularly towards Armenians, who were often viewed unfavorably by segments of Byzantine Roman society.&quot;The terrible race of the Armenians is deceitful and extremely vile, fanatical, deranged, and malignant, puffed up with hot air and full of slyness. A wise man said correctly about them that Armenians are vile when they live in obscurity, even more vile when they become famous, and most vile in all ways when they become rich. When they become filthy rich and honored, then to all they seem as vileness heaped upon vileness.&quot;261 works of secular literature are attributed to Kassia, consisting of epigrams and gnomic verses. Never set to music, they were written during the reigns of Theophilos and Michael III. Akin to the rest of her &quot;oeuvre&quot;, her writings demonstrate influence from classical Greek literature, which she studied early in life. These literary genres were chiefly dominated by men, so her contributions would have been unusual; Byzantinist Andrew Mellas noted that &quot;perhaps this was an advantage for Kassia and accounts for her originality&quot;.

The genre of epigrams had existed from classical antiquity and into the Byzantine empire, being defined as somewhere in between the scope of lyric and epic poetry. Their exact organization was unformalized, ranging from the use of couplets to iambic pentameter, among others. The works are generally rooted in the long tradition, though they include her own unique innovations. In this genre, she is credited with first synthesizing secular and sacred values. While the works are secular in character, they promoted ethical teachings for the lives of Christians. Byzantinist described this approach as &quot;An osmosis of ancient wisdom and monastic truth&quot;. Kassia abandoned typical themes found in Greek prosody, preferring to discuss more individual and personal issues. In addition to ethnical ideals, the themes Kassia covers include ethnical ideals and weaknesses (her examples include &#x27;foolishness&#x27; and &#x27;friendship&#x27;); social structures; femininity (particularly &#x27;beauty&#x27;); and the defense of women&#x27;s rights. This approach would have made the genre more relevant and accessible to the Byzantine people, though the extent of her epigrams&#x27; circulation remains unclear. Her epigrams are particularly reminiscent of similar works by her colleague Theodore the Studite, and are characterized by a concise and straight forward presentation, often including witty or humorous elements. According to Mellas, it is probable that they were &quot;a form Catechism for her nuns and perhaps any friends of the monastery.&quot;

Kassia&#x27;s gnomic verses were much shorter, usually a single-verse teachings. They often include moral adages and like the epigrams, were succinct.

==Portrayals==
Many fictitious stories were created around her relationship with Emperor Theophilos. Contemporary historians such as Glykas, Ptochoprodromos, Kodinos, Zonaras, and Georgios Amartolos described her exile in Italy during the Iconoclasy wars and later settled and died in Kasos sometime between 867 and 890.

She is portrayed by Karima McAdams in the 5th season of the television series &quot;Vikings&quot;.

In August 2019, English singer-songwriter Frank Turner included a song told from her point of view on his album &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;.

==Religious commemoration==
The feast day of Saint Kassiani is celebrated by the Orthodox Church on 7 September.

She is often depicted on the icon of the Sunday of Orthodoxy (the First Sunday of Great Lent), because of her strong defence of the veneration of icons.

In 2022, Kassia was officially added to the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar with a feast day on 7 September.

<doc id="438952" wikidata="Q1162530" url="?curid=438952" title="Tzedakah">
<text>Tzedakah ( &quot;ṣədāqā&quot;, ) is a Hebrew word meaning &quot;righteousness&quot;, but commonly used to signify &quot;charity&quot;. This concept of &quot;charity&quot; differs from the modern Western understanding of &quot;charity&quot;. The latter is typically understood as a spontaneous act of goodwill and a marker of generosity; &quot;tzedakah&quot; is an ethical obligation, and it is not properly &quot;charity&quot;, like in Christendom, but a way to empower poor people to support themselves, helping them in developing their talents and skills.

&quot;Tzedakah&quot; (Tzedaka) refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just, which Judaism emphasizes as an important part of living a spiritual life. Unlike voluntary philanthropy, &quot;tzedakah&quot; is seen as a religious obligation that must be performed regardless of one&#x27;s financial standing, and so is mandatory even for those of limited financial means. &quot;Tzedakah&quot; is considered to be one of the three main acts that can positively influence an unfavorable heavenly decree.

The word &quot;tzedakah&quot; is based on the Hebrew (, ), meaning &quot;righteousness&quot;, &quot;fairness,&quot; or &quot;justice&quot;, and is related to the Hebrew word &quot;Tzadik&quot;, meaning &quot;righteous&quot; as an adjective (or &quot;righteous individual&quot; as a noun in the form of a substantive). Although the word appears 157 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, typically in relation to &quot;righteousness&quot; &quot;per se&quot;, its use as a term for &quot;charity&quot; in the above sense is an adaptation of Rabbinic Judaism in Talmudic times.

In the Middle Ages, Maimonides conceived of an eight-level hierarchy of &quot;tzedakah&quot;, where the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient becoming self-sufficient instead of living upon others. In his view, the second highest form of &quot;tzedakah&quot; is to give donations anonymously to unknown recipients.

==Precedents in ancient Israel==

The Hebrew Bible teaches the obligation to aid those in need, but does not employ one single term for this obligation. The term &quot;tzedakah&quot; occurs 157 times in the Masoretic Text, typically in relation to &quot;righteousness&quot; per se, usually in the singular, but sometimes in the plural &quot;tzedekot&quot;, in relation to acts of charity. In the Septuagint this was sometimes translated as &quot;eleemosyne&quot;, &quot;almsgiving&quot;.

Today, however, it is evident that it is not very correct to use some expressions such as &quot;charity&quot; or &quot;alms&quot;, it is not always accepted, in fact even parents have the duty to give to their children and this is considered Tzedakah, also thanks to the abundance of products and money in most of cases.

==In rabbinical literature of the classical and Middle Ages==

In classical rabbinical literature, it was argued that the Biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to cereal grain fields, orchards, and vineyards, and not to vegetable gardens. The classical rabbinical writers were much stricter as to who could receive the remains. It was stated that the farmer was not permitted to benefit from the gleanings, and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions (Hullin 131a, Pe&#x27;ah 5:6). The farmer was not even allowed to help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also argued that the law was only applicable in Canaan (Jerusalem Talmud. Pe&#x27;ah 2:5), although many classical rabbinical writers who were based in Babylon observed the laws there (Hullin 134b). It was also seen as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor non-Jews were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace.

Maimonides is known for enumerating Eight Levels of Giving (where the first level is most preferable, and the eighth the least):

#Giving an interest-free loan to a person in need; forming a partnership with a person in need; giving a grant to a person in need; finding a job for a person in need, so long as that loan, grant, partnership, or job results in the person no longer living by relying upon others.
#Giving tzedakah anonymously to an unknown recipient via a person or public fund that is trustworthy, wise, and can perform acts of tzedakah with your money in a most impeccable fashion.
#Giving tzedakah anonymously to a known recipient.
#Giving tzedakah publicly to an unknown recipient.
#Giving tzedakah before being asked.
#Giving adequately after being asked.
#Giving willingly, but inadequately.
#Giving &quot;in sadness&quot; (giving out of pity): It is thought that Maimonides was referring to giving because of the sad feelings one might have in seeing people in need (as opposed to giving because it is a religious obligation). Other translations say &quot;giving unwillingly&quot;.

==In practice==

In practice, most Jews carry out &quot;tzedakah&quot; by donating a portion of their income to charitable institutions, or to needy people they may encounter. The perception among many modern-day Jews is that if donation of this form is not possible, the obligation of &quot;tzedakah&quot; still requires that something be given. Traditional Jews commonly practice &quot;ma&#x27;sar kesafim&quot;, tithing 10% of their income to support those in need.

The Shulchan Arukh was composed in 16th century and has become the most widely accepted code of Jewish law ever written. It states:

Special acts of &quot;tzedakah&quot; are performed on significant days: At weddings, Jewish brides and bridegrooms would traditionally give to charity to symbolise the sacred character of the marriage. At Passover, a major holiday in Jewish tradition, it is traditional to be welcoming towards hungry strangers and feed them at the table. At Purim it is considered obligatory for every Jew to give food to one other person, and gifts to at least two poor people, in an amount that would equate to a meal each, for the purpose of increasing the total happiness during the month.

As for the more limited form of &quot;tzedakah&quot; expressed in the biblical laws, namely the leaving of &quot;gleanings&quot; from certain crops, the Shulchan Aruch argues that during The Exile Jewish farmers are not obliged to obey it. Nevertheless, in modern Israel, rabbis of Orthodox Judaism insist that Jews allow &quot;gleanings&quot; to be consumed by the poor and by strangers, and all crops (not just &quot;gleanings&quot;) by anyone and everyone (free, not bought nor sold) during sabbatical years.

In addition, one must be very careful about how one gives out tzedakah money. It is not sufficient to give to just any person or organization; rather, one must check their credentials and finances to be sure that your tzedakah money will be used wisely, efficiently, and effectively. The meaning of &quot;Do not steal from a poor person, for (s)he is poor&quot; (Proverbs 22:22) and of Talmudic-era commentaries, including Numbers Rabba 5:2, is that tzedakah money was never yours to begin with. Rather, it always belongs to God, who merely entrusts you with it so that you may use it properly. Hence, you are obliged to ensure that it is received by those who are deserving.

According to the Halacha, every time a poor person asks for charity, he must be given at least a small amount, as it is written in the Torah,&quot; Do not make an effort to give but let it come of yourself, and do not close your hand from giving to the poor&quot; (Deuteronomy 15:7), but if one is in the middle of the prayer, there is no obligation to give him charity, since during prayer time one is busy with another mitzvah

There are many examples of tzedakah funds that operate according to Maimonides&#x27; principles above (particularly #2), including Hands on Tzedakah (working with nonprofits in the U.S. and in Israel), and Mitzvah Heroes Fund (working mainly with nonprofits in Israel). Paamonim is a nonprofit organization in Israel that operates according to Maimonides&#x27; first principle. Keeping a &quot;pushke&quot; (a collection box) in private homes is traditional.

The Gaon of Vilna considered giving tzedakah &quot;to all householders in our city with tax-benefit&quot;. Dvēyre-Ēster Helfer (1817–1907), known to Vilna&#x27;s Jews for her integrity and wisdom, was legendary for her ability to help people in trouble, although she and her husband were not wealthy. Aided by her phenomenal memory, she was able to touch the right people at the right time to help individuals throughout her life, many of whom came to see her as a sort of saint who not only found money for her, but also offered special blessings accompanying her charitable gifts. She also helped fund a prayerhouse dedicated to charity for the needy that was known colloquially by her name; in her lifetime she came to be seen as a saint, while her death was commemorated in ways usually reserved for religious figures; and her portrait often hung next to the Gaon&#x27;s in the homes of Vilna&#x27;s Jews.

===Pushka===
Both Jewish homes and synagogues have a charity collection box into which cash is placed. At home, particularly before the woman of the house lights her Sabbath candles, it is a way of setting aside money. In the synagogue, a designated individual circulates (and shakes it to announce this opportunity).

In Chicago in the early 1900s &quot;Many of the families kept &quot;pushkas&quot;, or contribution containers, as a handy means of making periodic contribution to worthwhile causes.&quot; The Polish word &quot;puszka&quot; means tin can.

===TAT===
&quot;TAT&quot; (an acronym for &quot;Tomchei Torah&quot;) is an institutionalized arrangement whereby money is donated for either one-time (e.g. wedding) expenses or ongoing support, for the adult (and often married) yeshiva students. A check made out to &quot;TAT of x&quot; would be for those at that yeshiva, or perhaps it can be designated for a particular newly engaged student (or a student with a son or daughter newly engaged). Sometimes donations were intended for ongoing support of students not receiving family support.

<doc id="438953" wikidata="Q12030" url="?curid=438953" title="4′33″">
<text>4′33″ is a modernist composition by American experimental composer John Cage. It was composed in 1952 for any instrument or combination of instruments; the score instructs performers not to play their instruments throughout the three movements. It is divided into three movements, lasting 30 seconds, two minutes and 23 seconds, and one minute and 40 seconds, respectively, although Cage later stated that the movements&#x27; durations can be determined by the musician. As suggested by the title, the composition lasts four minutes and 33 seconds. It is marked by silence except for ambient sound, which is intended to contribute to the performance.

&quot;4′33″&quot; was conceived around 1947–48, while Cage was working on the piano cycle &quot;Sonatas and Interludes.&quot; Many prior musical pieces were largely composed of silence, and silence played a notable role in his prior work, including &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot;. His studies on Zen Buddhism during the late 1940s about chance music led him to acknowledge the value of silence in providing an opportunity to reflect on one&#x27;s surroundings and psyche. Recent developments in contemporary art also bolstered Cage&#x27;s understanding on silence, which he increasingly began to perceive as impossible after Rauschenberg&#x27;s &quot;White Painting&quot; was first displayed.

&quot;4′33″&quot; premiered in 1952 and was met with shock and widespread controversy; many musicologists revisited the very definition of music and questioned whether Cage&#x27;s work qualified as such. In fact, Cage intended &quot;4′33″&quot; to be experimental—to test the audience&#x27;s attitude to silence and prove that any auditory experience may constitute music, seeing that absolute silence cannot exist. Although &quot;4′33″&quot; is labelled as four minutes and thirty-three seconds of silence, Cage maintains that the ambient noises heard during the performance contribute to the composition. Since this counters the conventional involvement of harmony and melody in music, many musicologists consider &quot;4′33″&quot; to be the birth of noise music, and some have likened it to Dadaist art. &quot;4′33″&quot; also embodies the idea of musical indeterminacy, as the silence is subject to the individual&#x27;s interpretation; thereby, one is encouraged to explore their surroundings and themselves, as stipulated by Lacanianism.

&quot;4′33″&quot; greatly influenced modernist music, furthering the genres of noise music and silent music, which—whilst still controversial to this day—reverberate among many contemporary musicians. Cage re-explored the idea of silent composition in two later renditions: &quot;0′00″&quot; (1962) and &quot;One3&quot; (1989). In a 1982 interview, and on numerous other occasions, he stated that &quot;4′33″&quot; was his most important work. &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; describes &quot;4′33″&quot; as Cage&#x27;s &quot;most famous and controversial creation&quot;. In 2013, Dale Eisinger of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked the composition eighth in his list of the greatest performance art works.

==Background==

===The concept===

The first time Cage mentioned the idea of a piece composed entirely of silence was during a 1947 (or 1948) lecture at Vassar College, &quot;A Composer&#x27;s Confessions&quot;. At this time, he was working on the cycle for piano &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot;. Cage told the audience that he had &quot;several new desires&quot;, one of which was:

Prior to this, silence had played a major role in several of Cage&#x27;s works composed before &quot;4′33″&quot;. The &quot;Duet for Two Flutes&quot; (1934), composed when Cage was 22, opens with silence, and silence was an important structural element in some of the &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot; (1946–48), &quot;Music of Changes&quot; (1951) and &quot;Two Pastorales&quot; (1951). The &quot;Concerto for prepared piano and orchestra&quot; (1951) closes with an extended silence, and &quot;Waiting&quot; (1952), a piano piece composed just a few months before &quot;4′33″&quot;, consists of long silences framing a single, short ostinato pattern. Furthermore, in his songs &quot;The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs&quot; (1942) and &quot;A Flower&quot; (1950) Cage directs the pianist to play a closed instrument, which may be understood as a metaphor of silence.

However, at the time of its conception, Cage felt that a fully silent piece would be incomprehensible, and was reluctant to write it down: &quot;I didn&#x27;t wish it to appear, even to me, as something easy to do or as a joke. I wanted to mean it utterly and be able to live with it.&quot; Painter Alfred Leslie recalls Cage presenting a &quot;one-minute-of-silence talk&quot; in front of a window during the late 1940s, while visiting Studio 35 at New York University.

===Precursors===
Although he was a pioneer of silent music, Cage was not the first to compose it. Others, especially in the first half of the twentieth century, had already published related work, which possibly influenced Cage. As early as 1907, Ferruccio Busoni delineated the importance of silence in music:

An example is the &quot;Funeral March for the Obsequies of a Deaf Man&quot; (in French: &quot;Marche funèbre composée pour les funérailles d&#x27;un grand homme sourd&quot;) (1897) by Alphonse Allais, consisting of 24 empty measures. Allais was a companion of his fellow composer Erik Satie, and, since Cage admired the latter, the &quot;Funeral March&quot; may have motivated him to compose &quot;4′33″&quot;, but he later wrote that he was not aware of Allais&#x27; work at the time. Silent compositions of the twentieth century preceding Cage&#x27;s include the &#x27;In futurum&#x27; movement from the &quot;Fünf Pittoresken&quot; (1919) by Erwin Schulhoff—solely comprising rests— and Yves Klein&#x27;s &quot;Monotone–Silence Symphony&quot; (1949), in which the second and fourth movements are bare twenty minutes of silence.

Similar ideas had been envisioned in literature. For instance, Harold Acton&#x27;s prose fable &quot;Cornelian&quot; (1928) mentions a musician conducting &quot;performances consisting largely of silence&quot;. In 1947, jazz musician Dave Tough joked that he was writing a play in which &quot;a string quartet is playing the most advanced music ever written. It&#x27;s made up entirely of rests ... Suddenly, the viola man jumps up in a rage and shakes his bow at the first violin. &#x27;Lout&#x27;, he screams, &#x27;you played that last measure wrong&#x27;&quot;.

===Direct influences===

====Zen Buddhism====
Since the late 1940s, Cage had been studying Zen Buddhism, especially through Japanese scholar Daisetz Suzuki, who introduced the field to the Western World. Thereon, he connected sounds in silence to the notions of &quot;unimpededness and interpenetration&quot;. In a 1951/1952 lecture, he defined unimpededness as &quot;seeing that in all of space each thing and each human being is at the center&quot;, and interpenetration as the view &quot;that each one of the [things and humans at the center] is moving out in all directions penetrating and being penetrated by every other one no matter what the time or what the space&quot;, concluding that &quot;each and every thing in all of time and space is related to each and every other thing in all of time and space&quot;.

Cage believed that sounds existed in a state of unimpededness, as each one is not hindered by the other due to them being isolated by silence, but also that they interpenetrate each other, since they work in tandem with each other and &#x27;interact&#x27; with the silence. Hence, he thought that music is intrinsically an alternation between sound and silence, especially after his visit to Harvard University&#x27;s anechoic chamber. He increasingly began to see silence as an integral part of music since it allows for sounds to exist in the first place—to interpenetrate each other. The prevalence of silence in a composition also allowed the opportunity for contemplation on one&#x27;s psyche and surroundings, reflecting the Zen emphasis on meditation music as means to soothe the mind. As he began to realize the impossibility of absolute silence, Cage affirmed the psychological significance of &#x27;lack of sound&#x27; in a musical composition:

In 1951, Cage composed the &quot;Concerto for Prepared Piano and Chamber Orchestra&quot;, which can be seen as an representation of the concept of interpenetration.

====Chance music====
Cage also explored the concept of chance music—a composition without melodic structure or regular notation. The aforementioned &quot;Concerto for Prepared Piano&quot; employs the concepts posited in the Ancient Chinese text &quot;I Ching&quot;.

====Visit to the anechoic chamber====
In 1951, Cage visited the anechoic chamber at Harvard University. Cage entered the chamber expecting to hear silence, but he later wrote: &quot;I heard two sounds, one high and one low. When I described them to the engineer in charge, he informed me that the high one was my nervous system in operation, the low one my blood in circulation&quot;. Cage had gone to a place where he expected total silence, and yet heard sound. &quot;Until I die there will be sounds. And they will continue following my death. One need not fear about the future of music&quot;. The realization as he saw it of the impossibility of silence led to the composition of &quot;4′33″&quot;.

====&quot;White Painting&quot;====
Another cited influence for this piece came from the field of the visual arts. Cage&#x27;s friend and sometimes colleague Robert Rauschenberg had produced, in 1951, a series of white paintings (collectively named &quot;White Painting&quot;), seemingly &quot;blank&quot; canvases (though painted with white house paint) that in fact change according to varying light conditions in the rooms in which they were hung, the shadows of people in the room and so on. This inspired Cage to use a similar idea, as he later stated, &quot;Actually what pushed me into it was not guts but the example of Robert Rauschenberg. His white paintings ... when I saw those, I said, &#x27;Oh yes, I must. Otherwise I&#x27;m lagging, otherwise music is lagging&#x27;.&quot; In an introduction to an article &quot;On Robert Rauschenberg, Artist, and His Works&quot;, John Cage writes: &quot;To Whom It May Concern: The white paintings came first; my silent piece came later.&quot;

==The composition==

===Premiere and initial reception===
The premiere of the three-movement &quot;4′33″&quot; was given by David Tudor on August 29, 1952, in Maverick Concert Hall, Woodstock, New York, as part of a recital of contemporary piano music. The audience saw him sit at the piano and, to mark the beginning of the piece, close the keyboard lid. Some time later he opened it briefly, to mark the end of the first movement. This process was repeated for the second and third movements. Although the audience was enthusiastic about contemporary art, the premiere was met with widespread controversy and scandal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon 1998/2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; such that Calvin Tomkins notes: &quot;The Woodstock audience considered the piece either a joke or an affront, and this has been the general reaction of most people who have heard it, or heard of it, ever since. Some listeners have been unaware they were hearing it at all&quot;.

===General reception===
Music critic Kyle Gann called the piece &quot;one of the most misunderstood pieces of music ever written and yet, at times, one of the avant-garde&#x27;s best understood as well&quot;. He dismissed the idea that &quot;4′33″&quot; was a joke or a hoax, wrote that the theory of Dada and theater have some justification, and said that for him the composition is a &quot;thought experiment&quot;. He concluded that the idea that &quot;4′33″&quot; is a &quot;Zen practice&quot; &quot;may be the most directly fertile suggestion&quot;.

==Analysis==
The composition is an indispensable contribution to the Modernist movement and formalized noise music as a genre. Noise music is seen as the anathema to the traditional view of harmony in music, exploiting random sound patterns &#x27;noise&#x27; in the process of making music—the &quot;detritus of the music process&quot;. Paul Hegarty notes that: &quot;The silence of the pianist in &quot;4′33″&quot; can be understood as the traditional silence of the audience so that it can appreciate the music being played. Music itself is sacrificed, sacrificed to the musicality of the world&quot;. For Hegarty, &quot;4′33″&quot;, is made up of incidental sounds that represent perfectly the tension between &quot;desirable&quot; sound (properly played musical notes) and undesirable &quot;noise&quot; that make up all noise music. It is made of three movements.

===Intentions===
&quot;4′33″&quot; challenges, or rather exploits to a radical extent, the social regiments of the modern concert life etiquette, experimenting on unsuspecting concert-goers to prove an important point. First, the choice of a prestigious venue and the social status of the composer and the performers automatically heightens audience&#x27;s expectations for the piece. As a result, the listener is more focused, giving Cage&#x27;s &quot;4′33″&quot; the same amount of attention (or perhaps even more) as if it were Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. Thus, even before the performance, the reception of the work is already predetermined by the social setup of the concert. Furthermore, the audience&#x27;s behavior is limited by the rules and regulation of the concert hall; they will quietly sit and listen to &quot;4′33″&quot; of ambient noise. It is not easy to get a large group of people to listen to ambient noise for nearly five minutes, unless they are regulated by the concert hall etiquette.

The second point made by &quot;4′33″&quot; concerns duration. According to Cage, duration is the essential building block of all of music. This distinction is motivated by the fact that duration is the only element shared by both silence and sound. As a result, the underlying structure of any musical piece consists of an organized sequence of &quot;time buckets&quot;. They could be filled with either sounds, silence or noise; where neither of these elements is absolutely necessary for completeness. In the spirit of his teacher Schoenberg, Cage managed to emancipate the silence and the noise to make it an acceptable or, perhaps, even an integral part of his music composition. &quot;4′33″&quot; serves as a radical and extreme illustration of this concept, asking that if the time buckets are the only necessary parts of the musical composition, then what stops the composer from filling them with no intentional sounds?

The third point is that the work of music is defined not only by its content but also by the behavior it elicits from the audience. In the case of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Rite of Spring&quot;, this would consist of widespread dissatisfaction leading up to violent riots. In Cage&#x27;s &quot;4′33″&quot;, the audience felt cheated by having to listen to no composed sounds from the performer. Nevertheless, in &quot;4′33″&quot; the audience contributed the bulk of the musical material of the piece. Since the piece consists of exclusively ambient noise, the audience&#x27;s behavior, their whispers and movements, are essential elements that fill the above-mentioned time buckets.

Above all, &quot;4′33″&quot;—in fact, more of an experiment than a composition—is intended to question the very notion of music. Cage believed that &quot;silence is a real note&quot; and &quot;will henceforth designate all the sounds not wanted by the composer&quot;. He had the ambition to go beyond what is achievable on a piece of paper by leaving the musical process to chance, inviting the audience to closely monitor the ambient noises characterizing the piece. French musicologist Daniel Charles proposes a related theory; &quot;4′33″&quot; is—resulting from the composer&#x27;s lack of interference in the piece—a &#x27;happening&#x27;, since, during the performance, the musician is more of an actor than a &#x27;musician&#x27;, per se. He also notes that it resembles a Duchamp-style found object, due to the fact that it creates art from objects that do not serve an artistic function, as silence is often associated with the opposite of music. In fact, Cage&#x27;s composition draws parallels to the Dadaist movement due to the involvement of &#x27;anti-art&#x27; objects into art (music), its apparent nonsensical nature, and blatant defiance of the status quo.

===Silence===
Indeed, the perceived silence characterizing Cage&#x27;s composition is not actually &#x27;silence&#x27;, but the interference of the ambient sounds made by the audience and environment. To him, any auditory experience containing some degree of sound, and hence can be considered music, countering its frequent label as &quot;four minutes thirty-three seconds of silence&quot;.

===Psychological impact===
The Lacanian approach implies a profound psychological connection to &quot;4′33″&quot;, as the individual is invited to ponder their surroundings and psyche. In a 2013 TED talk, psychologist Paul Bloom put forward &quot;4′33″&quot; as one example to show that knowing about the origin of something influences how one formulates an opinion on it. In this case, one can deem the five minutes of silence in Cage&#x27;s composition as different than five minutes of ordinary silence, as in a library, as they know where this silence originates; hence, they can feel motivated to pay to listen to &quot;4′33″&quot;, even though it is inherently no different than five minutes of ordinary silence.

===Surrealist automatism===

Some musicologists have argued that &quot;4′33″&quot; is an example of surrealist automatism. Since the Romantic Era composers have been striving to produce music that could be separated from any social connections, transcending the boundaries of time and space. In automatism, composers and artists strive to eliminate their role in the creation of work, motivated by the belief that self-expression always includes the infiltration of the social standards—that the individual (including the musician) is subjected to from birth—in artistic truth (the message the musician wishes to convey).

Therefore, the only method by which the listener can realize artistic truth involves the separation of the musician from their work. In &quot;4′33″&quot;, the composer has no impact in his work, as Cage cannot control the ambient sounds detected by the audience. Hence, the composition is automatic since the musician has no involvement in how the listener interprets it.

===Indeterminacy===
A pioneer of musical indeterminacy, Cage defined it as &quot;the ability of a piece to be performed in substantially different ways&quot;.

==Versions==

===Of the score===
Several versions of the score exist; the four below are the main samples that could be identified. Their shared quality is the composition&#x27;s duration of four minutes and thirty-three seconds—reflected in the title &quot;4′33″&quot;— but there is some discrepancy between the lengths of individual movements, specified in different versions of the score. The causes of this discrepancy are not currently understood.

====Woodstock manuscript and reproduction====
The original Woodstock manuscript (August 1952) is written in conventional notation and dedicated to David Tudor – the first to perform the piece. It is currently lost, but Tudor did attempt to recreate the original score, reproduced in William Fetterman&#x27;s book &quot;John Cage&#x27;s Theatre Pieces: Notations and Performances&quot;. The reproduction notes that &quot;4′33″&quot; can be performed for any instrument or combination of instruments. Regarding tempo, it includes a treble clef staff with a 4/4 time signature, and the beginning of each sentence is identified with Roman numerals and a scale indication: &#x27;60 [quarter] = 1/2-inch&#x27;. At the end of each sentence, there is information about each movement&#x27;s duration in minutes and seconds; these are: &#x27;I = 30 seconds&#x27;, &#x27;II = 2 minutes 23 seconds&#x27; and &#x27;III = 1 minute 40 seconds&#x27;. Tudor commented: &quot;It&#x27;s important that you read the score as you&#x27;re performing it, so there are these pages you use. So you wait, and then turn the page. I know it sounds very straight, but in the end it makes a difference&quot;.

====Kremen manuscript====
The Kremen manuscript (1953) is written in graphic, space-time notation—which Cage dubbed &quot;proportional notation&quot;—and dedicated to the American artist Irwin Kremen. The movements of the piece are rendered as space between long vertical lines; a tempo indication is provided (60), and at the end of each movement the time is indicated in minutes and seconds. In page 4, the note &#x27;1 PAGE = 7 INCHES = 56″&#x27; is included. The same instructions, timing and indications to the reproduced Woodstock manuscript are implemented.

====First Tacet Edition====
The so-called &quot;First Tacet Edition&quot; (or &quot;Typed Tacet Edition&quot;) (1960) is a typewritten score, originally printed in Edition Peters as EP No. 6777. It lists the three movements using Roman numbers, with the word &#x27;tacet&#x27; underneath each. A note by Cage describes the first performance and mentions that &quot;the work may be performed by any instrumentalist or combination of instrumentalists and last any length of time&quot;. In doing so, Cage not only regulates the reading of the score, but also determines the identity of the composition. Conversely to the initial two manuscripts, Cage notes that the premiere organized the movements into the following durations: 33&quot;, 2&#x27;40&quot; and 1&#x27;20&quot;, and adds that their length &quot;must be found by chance&quot; performance. The &quot;First Tacet Edition&quot; is described in Michael Nyman&#x27;s book &quot;Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond&quot;, but is not reproduced.

====&quot;Second Tacet Edition&quot;====
The so-called &quot;Second Tacet Edition&quot; (or &quot;Calligraphic Tacet Edition&quot;) (1986) is the same as the First, except that it is printed in Cage&#x27;s calligraphy, and the explanatory note mentions the Kremen manuscript. It is also classified as EP No. 6777 (i.e., it carries the same catalog number as the first &quot;Tacet Edition&quot;). Additionally, a facsimile, reduced in size, of the Kremen manuscript, appeared in July 1967 in &quot;Source&quot; 1, no. 2:46–54.

===Of the composition itself===

====&quot;4′33″ No. 2&quot;====
In 1962, Cage wrote &quot;0′00″&quot;, which is also referred to as &quot;4′33″ No. 2&quot;. The directions originally consisted of one sentence: &quot;In a situation provided with maximum amplification, perform a disciplined action&quot;. At the first performance Cage had to write that sentence. The second performance added four new qualifications to the directions: &quot;the performer should allow any interruptions of the action, the action should fulfill an obligation to others, the same action should not be used in more than one performance, and should not be the performance of a musical composition&quot;.

====&quot;One3&quot;====
In late 1989, three years before his death, Cage revisited the idea of &quot;4′33″&quot; one last time. He composed &quot;One3&quot;, the full title of which is &quot;One3 = 4′33″ (0′00″) + [G Clef]&quot;. As in all of the Number Pieces, &#x27;One&#x27; refers to the number of performers required. The score instructs the performer to build a sound system in the concert hall, so that &quot;the whole hall is on the edge of feedback, without actually feeding back&quot;. The content of the piece is the electronically amplified sound of the hall and the audience.

==Plagiarism==
In July 2002, Cage&#x27;s heirs sued British singer-songwriter Mike Batt for plagiarism for the &#x27;song&#x27; &quot;A One Minute Silence&quot;: literally, a minute of silence. To support his crossover ensemble The Planets, he inserted a one-minute pause in their February 2002 album &quot;Classical Graffiti&quot; under the authorship &#x27;Batt/Cage&#x27;— supposedly to honor the composer. He was then sued by the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society for &quot;plagiarizing Cage&#x27;s silence [&quot;4′33″&quot;].

Initially, Batt said he would defend himself against these accusations, stating that &quot;A One Minute Silence&quot; was &quot;a much better silent piece&quot; and that he was &quot;able to say in one minute what Cage could only say in four minutes and 33 seconds&quot;. He eventually reached an out-of-court settlement with the composer&#x27;s heirs in September 2002 and paid what was described at the time as a &quot;six-figure sum&quot; in compensation. However, in December 2010, Batt admitted that the alleged legal dispute had been a publicity stunt and that he had actually only made a donation of £1,000 to the &quot;John Cage Foundation&quot;.

==Christmas number one campaign==
In the week leading up to Christmas 2010, a Facebook page was created to encourage residents of the United Kingdom to buy a new rendition of &quot;4′33″&quot;, in the hope that it would prevent the winner of the seventh series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, Matt Cardle, from topping the UK Singles Chart and becoming the Christmas number one. The page was inspired by a similar campaign the year prior, in which a Facebook page set up by English radio DJ Jon Morter and his then-wife Tracey, prompting people to buy Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; in the week before Christmas 2009 to make it the Christmas number one. Hence, the &quot;4′33″&quot; campaign was dubbed &#x27;Cage Against the Machine&#x27;. The creators of the Facebook page hoped that reaching number one would promote Cage&#x27;s composition and &quot;make December 25 &#x27;a silent night&#x27;.&quot;

The campaign received support from several celebrities. It first came into prominence after science writer Ben Goldacre mentioned it on his Twitter profile. Despite many similar campaigns occurring that year, &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Tom Ewing considered &#x27;Cage Against the Machine&#x27; &quot;the &quot;only&quot; effort this year with a hope of [reaching number one]&quot;. XFM DJ Eddy Temple-Morris and &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Luke Bainbridge also voiced their support. Ultimately, the rendition of &quot;4′33″&quot; failed to reach number one, only peaking at number 21 on the charts; the winning song of &quot;X Factor&quot; instead became Christmas number one of 2010.

==Notable performances and recordings==
Due to its unique avant-garde style, many musicians and groups have performed &quot;4′33″&quot;, featuring in several works such as albums.

* Frank Zappa recorded a version of the composition as part of the collaborative album &quot;A Chance Operation: The John Cage Tribute&quot;, released by Koch Entertainment in 1993.
* Several performances of &quot;4′33″&quot; including a &#x27;techno remix&#x27; of the New Waver project were broadcast on Australian radio station ABC Classic FM, as part of a program exploring &quot;sonic responses&quot; to Cage&#x27;s work. Another of these &#x27;responses&#x27; was the rendition named &#x27;You Can Make Your Own Music&#x27;, recorded by the Swedish electronic band Covenant as part of their 2000 album &quot;United States of Mind&quot;.
* On January 16, 2004, at the Barbican Centre in London, the BBC Symphony Orchestra gave the United Kingdom&#x27;s first orchestral performance of this work, conducted by Lawrence Foster. The performance was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3, and the station faced a unique problem; its emergency system—automatically switching on and playing separate music in a period of perceived silence &#x27;dead air&#x27;—interrupted the broadcast, and had to be switched off. On the same day, a tongue-in-cheek version was recorded by the staff of &quot;The Guardian&quot;.
* Living Colour released a recording of &quot;4′33″&quot; in 2009 as a hidden track on &quot;The Chair in the Doorway&quot;.
* On December 5, 2010, an international simultaneous performance of &quot;4′33″&quot; took place among 200 performers, amateur and professional musicians, and artists. The global orchestra, conducted live by Bob Dickinson, via video link, performed the piece in support of the &#x27;Cage Against The Machine&#x27; campaign to bring &quot;4′33″&quot; to 2010 Christmas Number 1 in the UK Singles Chart.
* On November 17, 2015, the television program &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; uploaded a video of the piece being performed by a cat, showing that its musician is not required to be human.
* In May 2019, Mute Records released a compilation box set entitled &quot;STUMM433&quot; featuring interpretations of &quot;4′33″&quot; by more than 50 artists which had collaborated with the record label, including Laibach, Depeche Mode, New Order, Cabaret Voltaire, Einstürzende Neubauten, Goldfrapp, Moby, Erasure.
* On October 31, 2020, the Berlin Philharmonic closed their last concert before a government-mandated COVID-19 related lockdown with a performance of the piece, conducted by Kirill Petrenko, &quot;to draw attention to the plight of artists following the lockdown of cultural institutions&quot;.

<text>The Lansbury Estate is a large, historic council housing estate in Poplar and Bromley-by-Bow in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is named after George Lansbury, a Poplar councillor and Labour Party MP.

==History==
Lansbury Estate is one of the largest such estates in London. It occupies an area bounded by the East India Dock Road to the south, the Docklands Light Railway to the east and the Limehouse Cut canal to the north-west.

Layout of the estate, built on a site badly damaged by bombing during the Second World War, began in 1949 to a design by London County Council planners led by Arthur Ling and Percy Johnson-Marshall. Construction of the estate started shortly before 1951 as the Live Architecture Exhibition for the Festival of Britain, with Frederick Gibberd&#x27;s Chrisp Street Market area and the Trinity Independent Chapel. The construction of the housing and other land-uses extended westwards, with the final phase, at Pigott Street, finished in 1982, near Bartlett Park.

The philosophy of the design was that new development should comprise neighbourhoods, and that within the neighbourhood should be all that a community required – flats, houses, churches, schools, an old people&#x27;s home, a pedestrianised shopping area and covered market. There should be pubs and open spaces, linked by footways. Traditional materials were used in the construction, such as London stock bricks and Welsh slate to counter the modern architecture.
The architecture critic Lewis Mumford wrote of the Lansbury Estate (1953) &quot;Its design has been based not solely on abstract aesthetic principles, or on the economics of commercial construction, or on the techniques of mass production, but on the social constitution of the community itself, with its diversity of human interests and human needs. Thus the architects and planners have avoided not only the clichés of ´high rise´ building but the dreary prisonlike order that results from forgetting the very purpose of housing and the necessities of neighbourhood living.&quot;

English Heritage has recognised the significance of the estate by listing some of the buildings including the SS Mary and Joseph Roman Catholic Church designed by Adrian Gilbert Scott; however, it noted that the estate has suffered considerable neglect, and also some well-meaning but ill-advised modernisation of the facilities within the associated market.

John Betjeman thought highly of the estate, along with the nearby St John&#x27;s Estate on the Isle of Dogs.

The Lansbury Estate was owned by the GLC and later by Tower Hamlets Council. After a &quot;stock transfer&quot; in 1998, the property was transferred to Poplar HARCA.

==Transport==

===Trains===
Langdon Park DLR station and All Saints DLR station serve the estate. Bromley-by-Bow tube station and Bow Road tube station are the nearest London Underground stations to the area. Limehouse station is the nearest National Rail station.

===Buses===
London Buses Routes 309 serve the centre of the area. With 15, 115, D6, D7, D8, 277, 135, D3 all serving the edge of the estate.

<doc id="438958" wikidata="Q1331593" url="?curid=438958" title="Lagoon triggerfish">
<text>The lagoon triggerfish (Rhinecanthus aculeatus), also known as the blackbar triggerfish, the Picasso triggerfish, or the Picassofish, is a triggerfish, up to in length, found on reefs in the Indo-Pacific region.

This species has been studied in a range of research contexts, from locomotion to color vision research.

==Behavior==
Lagoon triggerfish live in the reefs and sandy areas of coral reefs, where they eat just about anything that comes along, mostly including invertebrates and reef algae. They are always restlessly swimming around and vigorously protect their territory against intruders, including divers, especially when guarding their eggs during reproduction season. Their relatively small size makes them much less dangerous than the larger titan triggerfish of the same family.

The fish moves through the water by using waving motions in its dorsal and anal fins, allowing it to move more precisely. Using these movements, it can move forwards, backwards or simply hover in place above the reef. This means that it can more easily back out of crevices than other unidirectional fish.

==Mating and reproduction==
Both sexes guard territories, some maintaining a territory for eight years or longer (with males holding territories for significantly longer than females). A typical male territory may overlap with one to five female territories, and their mating system is described as haremic, although not much is known about this (similar mating systems are seen in other Balistidae species). If a male or female is removed or disappears their territories are soon taken over by a new fish. They reproduce multiple times over their lifetimes.

Pair-spawning takes place around sunrise, with the egg masses being attached to sand, coral rubble or algae. They hatch on the same day around sunset. Although paternal care is normal in teleost fishes with external fertilization, it is the mothers in this species that guard and care for eggs until they hatch. The mother remains above the eggs for about 12–14 hours, fanning the eggs with her pectoral fins to improve aeration for perhaps 30% of the time. She chases away most fish that approach and remove other intruders like starfish by mouth. Maternal care is effective in preventing predation, and experimental removal of the mothers reduced survival to almost nothing suggesting this behaviour is adaptive. Unlike fathers, mothers forage less and over a smaller area near the egg mass while caring for the eggs. Since the males have multiple mates, caring for an egg mass would probably be more costly in terms of lost mating opportunities so maternal care is considered to be an evolutionarily stable strategy.

==Vision==
This species has one type of single cone (SC), with an opsin peaking in sensitivity at 413 nm (S), and a double cone with two different opsins in each member peaking at 480 nm (M) and 530 nm (L) respectively. Behavioural research has provided evidence that individual members of the double cones can act as independent channels of colour information, aiding in understanding double cone function. This research suggests the species has trichromatic vision, like humans.

<doc id="438961" wikidata="Q842203" url="?curid=438961" title="ISSF shooting events">
<text>The International Shooting Sport Federation recognizes several shooting events, some of which have Olympic status. They are divided into four disciplines: rifle, pistol, shotgun and running target.

The main distinctions between different rifle events are the distances to the target and the shooting positions used. For the other disciplines, the position is always standing, and changes include limits to shooting times and different types of targets.

==The present events==


==Discontinued events==
Due to the ISSF, some Olympic events have been discontinued in the past. In total, Forty-five ISSF events have been discontinued.

==Common principles==
All ISSF shooting events consist of &quot;precision&quot; shooting in the sense that only the position of the shot on the target determines the result, not the time used to produce that shot (provided the time was within the set constraints, of course). This separates them from International Practical Shooting Confederation events and other kinds of action shooting. In rifle, pistol and running target events, the maximum score for each shot is 10 if shots are scored as integers, or 10.9 if scored decimally. In shotgun events, there is only hit or miss.

===Elimination, qualification, final===
In the 300 metre rifle events and the 50 metre rifle and pistol events, all participants of a main competition must compete at the same time. If the range capacity is not enough for this, an &quot;elimination round&quot; is conducted the day before the main competition. From this round, only so many shooters advance as the range capacity can allow. The program of the elimination round is the same as that of the match or qualification round.

The &quot;match&quot;, or &quot;qualification round&quot; in case of Olympic events, is then the major part of the competition. In all events except those where elimination rounds are held, shooters are divided as necessary into &quot;relays&quot; and shoot the match at different times during the competition day. In matches consisting of two stages, all shooters must complete the first stage before the second stage may commence. The stages are often completed on two consecutive days (especially so in 25 metre rapid fire pistol, the shotgun events, and the running target events).

In larger matches, but only in the Olympic events, a &quot;final&quot; is added to the qualification round. (At a national level, there may be finals even in some non-Olympic events, such as 50 metre rifle prone.) The top eight contestants (or top six in case of the shotgun events and 25 metre rapid fire pistol), qualify for the final. The final consists of 24 shots in the 10 metre air rifle and 10 metre air pistol events, 45 shots across all three positions in the 50 metre rifle three positions event, 20 shots (four five-shot series) in the 25 metre events, and two series in the shotgun events (that is, 50 targets in trap and skeet.) In rifle and pistol finals, the score zones are divided into decimals, so that each final shot may give up to 10.9 points. In shotgun finals, there is still only a hit or a miss, but a special type of clay target with coloured powder is used to make it easier for spectators to immediately see the result. In determining the final result, the qualification score is discarded, so the winner is the shooter with the best aggregate score. Ties are resolved by shooting as many additional shots (or series at 25 metres) as needed to break them.

===Scoring and tie-breaking===
In all rifle, pistol and running target events results are recorded in ten-shot series, despite the fact that none of them are actually shot this way; the pure precision events at 300 metres, 50 metres and 10 metres are shot at the shooter&#x27;s own pace, the 25 metre pistol events are shot in five-shot strings, and the running target events are shot one shot at the time. However, the recorded ten-shot series are used for tie-breaking, so that the participant with the better last series comes before the other. From 2009 however, the number of inner tens, where applicable, will be the first tie-breaking criterion. In events without finals this tie-breaking system can decide championships, while in Olympic events it only decides the qualification and starting order for the finals (or starting order only, in the case of six-shooter finals, where a special shoot-off is held if shooters are tied for the last final place). In 25 metre center-fire pistol and 25 metre standard pistol, ties for medal places are resolved by a one-string shoot-off.

Shotgun events are recorded in series of 25 targets (trap and skeet), 40 targets (women&#x27;s double trap) or 50 targets (men&#x27;s double trap).

==History and admittance of new events==
The first ISSF World Shooting Championships were held in 1897, and while the Olympic shooting program changed heavily until the 1930s, the World Championship program was quite stable. The early events were 300 metre rifle, 50 metre pistol (added 1900), and 300 metre army rifle (added 1911). In 1929, the program was extended with 100 metre running deer, 50 metre rifle and trap. Rapid fire pistol, although a popular Olympic event, was not added until 1933. After World War II, a number of new events were introduced. After the inclusion of the airgun events and 25 metre standard pistol in 1970, however, there have not been many additions, double trap being an exception.

Events can have a status as test events, with rules provided by the ISSF but not actually counted among the ISSF shooting events. 5-shot air pistol is such an event. The development of this 10 metre version of rapid fire pistol is more or less stalled however, as relatively few shooters have the special airguns needed, and several of the countries where the shooting form has some popularity use other rulesets instead of the one suggested by the ISSF. There are also official ISSF rules for automatic trap (also known as ball trap), although there are no ISSF championships in that event.

==Manufacturers==
Several companies design and manufacture firearms specifically for use in ISSF shooting events. Some companies specialize in air guns (rifle and pistol), while others specialize in pistols whether air powered or small caliber. For shotgun events, guns from traditional shotgun manufacturers are used.

Some manufacturers:
*Anschütz (Germany)
*Benelli (Italy)
*Beretta (Italy)
*Bleiker (Switzerland)
*Feinwerkbau (Germany)
*Hämmerli (Switzerland)
*Morini (Switzerland), specializes in pistols
*Pardini Arms (Italy), specializes in pistols
*Perazzi (Italy), shotguns
*Steyr (Austria), air rifles and air pistols.
*Walther Arms (Germany)

<text>Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway (born 21 January 2004) is the elder child of Crown Prince Haakon and the second child of Crown Princess Mette-Marit, and a grandchild of King Harald V. She is second in line of succession to the Norwegian throne after her father.

She represents the fifth generation of the sitting Norwegian royal family of the House of Glücksburg.

She has a younger brother, Prince Sverre Magnus, whom she ranks above in the line of succession after the implementation of absolute primogeniture in 1990. She also has an older half-brother, accused sex offender Marius Borg Høiby, and has described him as a role model. Norwegian media reported that his influence on her has raised deep concerns within the royal family, particularly given the accusations against him and their potential impact on her values and public image. This concern has reportedly influenced decisions such as extending her military service, which some interpret as a measure to distance her from his behavior and ongoing criminal case.

==Birth and baptism==

Born on 21 January 2004 at 9:13 am in The National Hospital, part of the Oslo University Hospital in Oslo, Princess Ingrid Alexandra is the first child and only daughter of Crown Prince Haakon, heir apparent to the throne. She is the granddaughter of King Harald V and Queen Sonja, and of convicted felon Sven O. Høiby. Her mother, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has a son named Marius Borg Høiby, born in 1997 from a previous unmarried relationship with convicted felon Morten Borg.

Ingrid Alexandra was baptised by Bishop Gunnar Stålsett in the chapel of the Royal Palace on 17 April 2004. Her grandfather the King, her aunt Princess Märtha Louise, King Frederik X of Denmark, the Crown Princess of Sweden, King Felipe VI of Spain, and her maternal grandmother Marit Tjessem were her godparents. The then-Crown Prince of Denmark and then-Prince of Asturias were unable to attend the christening due to their respective weddings scheduled to occur within a month of the christening.

On 31 August 2019, Ingrid Alexandra was confirmed in the Palace Chapel in Oslo with all her godparents present.

==Education and military service==
Ingrid Alexandra attended Sem Kindergarten in Asker, Akershus from April 2006 until August 2010. Ingrid Alexandra started her first day of elementary school on 19 August 2010 at Jansløkka School, a local state school attended by her half-brother. Her parents chose the school because they wanted her to have as ordinary a childhood as possible. Newspaper reports said Ingrid Alexandra would walk to school with her half-brother, and local citizens could expect to see her occasionally out in the community with her classmates on school outings. School officials hoped to make the school a place where the princess could make friends and enjoy some relief from public scrutiny.

On 17 June 2014, the Norwegian royal family announced that from the start of the 2014–2015 school year, Ingrid Alexandra would transfer to the private English-language Oslo International School, reportedly because her parents wanted her to be fluent in English. Ingrid Alexandra was transferred to Oslo&#x27;s Uranienborg School to complete her lower secondary education. She was part of the student council at Uranienborg School. In the fall of 2020, she began further schooling at Elvebakken Upper Secondary School in Oslo. She graduated in April 2023. After her graduation, Ingrid Alexandra worked as a school assistant and environmental worker at Uranienborg School.

Ingrid Alexandra started her 12 months of military service as a conscript at the Combat Engineer Battalion in Brigade Nord on 17 January 2024. She was one of 9,900 young Norwegians selected for mandatory military service in 2024. Ingrid Alexandra served in Skjold camp, Øverbygd. She is using her second name Alexandra as a surname during her military service. She was initially trained at the recruit school for eight weeks where she received basic military education. After the recruitment period, Ingrid Alexandra was assigned a service position, undergoing a professional period with specific education, followed by departmental training and practice. In September 2024, the Norwegian Royal Court announced that Ingrid Alexandra served as a gunner on a CV-90 infantry fighting vehicle. The Court also announced that she extended her military service to 15 months.

==Activities==
On 19 June 2010, Ingrid Alexandra served as a bridesmaid at the wedding of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling. In December 2012, the Princess attended an interview with her father by a Norwegian television programme in aid of Environmental Agents, the children&#x27;s environmental organization. Her mother was supposed to attend, but the Crown Prince attended instead as the Crown Princess was ill. She has taken part in traditional celebrations of the Constitution Day, as well as the traditional ski jumping tournament at Holmenkollen in Oslo.

On 4 May 2015, Ingrid Alexandra christened the Norwegian Rescue Company&#x27;s new lifeboat, &quot;Elias&quot;, in her first royal assignment. Accompanied by her grandfather the King, she was made godmother of the boat. On 19 May 2016, the &quot;Princess Ingrid Alexandra Sculpture Park&quot; opened in the Palace Park, as part of the celebration of the King and Queen&#x27;s 25th anniversary. It features sculptures made for children and by children. She takes active part in choosing the designs from among the contributions to the sculpture park from school children all over Norway. In 2018, she gave a guided tour of the park to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, on the occasion of their official visit to Norway.

On 12 February 2016, Ingrid Alexandra and her grandfather participated in the opening ceremony of the II Winter Youth Olympics in Lillehammer: the King, as he previously did in 1994 Winter Olympics, declared the Games opened, while the Princess, like her father Crown Prince Haakon did 22 years before, lit the cauldron. On 17 November 2018, Princess Ingrid Alexandra christened the research vessel &quot;Kronprins Haakon&quot;, which was named after her father. The vessel was christened at its home port of Tromsø. The princess spoke of her interest in the ocean and climate change, which motivated her in christening the ship. She stated that the ship will bring &quot;new and crucial knowledge about the polar areas, about the oceans and about climate change.&quot; Ingrid Alexandra won a gold medal in the Norwegian surfing championship for juniors in October 2020. She is known as an avid surfer, and she also trains at skiing and kickboxing.

On 20 January 2022, Ingrid Alexandra visited the three branches of the Norwegian government: the Storting, the Supreme Court and the office of the prime minister. These visits were part of a series of activities Princess Ingrid Alexandra undertook ahead of her 18th birthday the next day. Her father, Crown Prince Haakon, did the same on his own 18th birthday in 1991. On the day of her birthday on 21 January, she attended a meeting of the Council of State alongside Crown Prince Haakon and King Harald. This was followed by a series of congratulatory deputations from Norwegian officials at the Royal Palace. The Princess received congratulations from representatives of the governmental branches as well as the Sámi Parliament, county governors, the diplomatic corps, the Norwegian Armed Forces and the Church of Norway. Cannon salutes were fired at noon to mark Ingrid Alexandra&#x27;s birthday. On 16 June, the government held a dinner to mark her 18th birthday at the Oslo Public Library. On 17 June, a gala dinner was hosted by her grandparents, the King and Queen, at the Royal Palace. Guests from many European royal houses attended.

In October 2022, Ingrid Alexandra visited Norwegian Army&#x27;s Setermoen camp in Indre Troms. In October 2023, she and her parents attended Prince Christian of Denmark&#x27;s 18th birthday celebration banquet at Christiansborg Palace, Denmark. In May 2024, she wore military uniform for the first time on the National Day balcony appearance.

== Constitutional status ==
The Constitution of Norway was altered in 1990 to introduce absolute primogeniture, ensuring that the crown would pass to the eldest child regardless of sex but keeping the Crown Prince ahead of his elder sister, Princess Märtha Louise; the change was to apply for the first time to their children. Princess Ingrid Alexandra has thus been second in the line of succession since birth, preceded only by her father. Because of the reform, her status was not affected by the subsequent birth of her brother, Prince Sverre Magnus, in 2005. The Princess is expected to become Norway&#x27;s first female monarch since Queen Margaret, who reigned over Norway, Denmark and Sweden from the late 1380s until her death in 1412.

Along with her parents and grandparents – but unlike her younger brother Sverre, her older maternal half-brother Marius, and other relatives – Princess Ingrid Alexandra is a member of the Norwegian Royal House. The family belongs to the House of Glücksburg.

==Personal life==
Ingrid Alexandra was in a relationship with Magnus Heien Haugstad, a Norwegian economy student from Bærum, between 2022 and 2024.

<doc id="438963" wikidata="Q145954" url="?curid=438963" title="Pinus nigra">
<text>Pinus nigra, the Austrian pine or black pine, is a moderately variable species of pine, occurring across Southern Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the eastern Mediterranean, on the Anatolian peninsula of Turkey, Corsica and Cyprus, as well as Crimea and in the high mountains of Northwest Africa. 
The world&#x27;s oldest black pine, located in the Banaz district of Uşak, Türkiye, is estimated to be 1000 years old. This makes it significant in the country, which is known for a very dry climate, inhospitable for most trees. It has a length of 11 meters, a diameter of 3 meters and a circumference of 9.60 meters.
==Description==
&quot;Pinus nigra&quot; is a large coniferous evergreen tree, growing to high at maturity and spreading to wide. The bark is gray to yellow-brown, and is widely split by flaking fissures into scaly plates, becoming increasingly fissured with age. The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are thinner and more flexible in western populations.

The ovulate and pollen cones appear from May to June. The mature seed cones are (rarely to 11 cm) long, with rounded scales; they ripen from green to pale gray-buff or yellow-buff in September to November, about 18 months after pollination. The seeds are dark gray, long, with a yellow-buff wing long; they are wind-dispersed when the cones open from December to April. maturity is reached at 15–40 years; large seed crops are produced at 2–5 year intervals.

&quot;Pinus nigra&quot; is moderately fast growing, at about per year. It usually has a rounded conic form, that becomes irregular with age. The tree can be long-lived, with some trees over 500 years old. Multiple pests can damage &quot;P. nigra&quot;, including &quot;T. piniperda.&quot;

==Taxonomy==
The species is divided into two subspecies, each further subdivided into three varieties. Some authorities (e.g. &quot;Flora Europaea&quot;) treat several of the varieties at subspecific rank, but this reflects tradition rather than sound taxonomy, as the distinctions between the taxa are small.
;Subspecies
*&quot;P. nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;nigra&quot; in the east of the range, from Austria, northeast and central Italy, east to the Crimea and Turkey. Needles stout, rigid, 1.5–2 mm diameter, with 3–6 layers of thick-walled hypodermal cells.
** &quot;P. nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;nigra&quot; var. &quot;nigra&quot; (syn. &quot;Pinus nigra&quot; var. &quot;austriaca&quot;, &quot;Pinus nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;dalmatica&quot;) (Austrian pine): Austria, Balkans (except southern Greece).
** &quot;P. nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;nigra&quot; var. &quot;caramanica&quot; (Turkish black pine): Turkey, Cyprus, southern Greece.
** &quot;P. nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;nigra&quot; var. &quot;italica&quot; (Italian black pine): central Italy (Villetta Barrea, in Abruzzo National Park)
** &quot;P. nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;nigra&quot; var. &quot;pallasiana&quot; (syn. &quot;Pinus nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;pallasiana&quot;) (Crimean pine): Crimea, Cyprus.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Pinus nigra&quot; is a tree of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. 
The majority of the range is in Turkey. It is found in the higher elevations of the South Apennine mixed montane forests ecoregion in southern Italy and the Tyrrhenian-Adriatic sclerophyllous and mixed forests ecoregion in Sicily. There are remnant populations in the Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests ecoregion, and in the higher Atlas Mountains in Morocco and Algeria.

It is found at elevations ranging from sea level to , most commonly from . Several of the varieties have distinct English names.
It needs full sun to grow well, is intolerant of shade, and is resistant to snow and ice damage.

It has naturalized in parts of the midwestern states of the United States, 

== Ecology ==

In Mediterranean Europe and the Anatolian Peninsula (Asia Minor), trees usually associated with this species include Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;), Serbian spruce (&quot;Picea omorika&quot;), Bosnian pine (&quot;Pinus heldreichii&quot;), Norway spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;), Taurus cedar (&quot;Cedrus libani&quot;), European silver fir (&quot;Abies alba&quot;) and related firs. Several species of juniper (&quot;Juniperus&quot; spp.), and various broadleaf trees are associates.

=== Climate and provenance ===
&quot;Pinus nigra&quot; is a light-demanding species, intolerant of shade but resistant to wind and drought.
The eastern &quot;P. nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;nigra&quot; exhibits greater winter frost hardiness (hardy to below −30 °C) than the western &quot;P. nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;salzmannii&quot; (hardy to about −25 °C).

Different provenances (seed sources by geographic area) or varieties are adapted to different soil types: Austrian and Pyrenees origins grow well on a wide range of soil types, Corsican origins grows poorly on limestone, while Turkish and Crimean origins grow well on limestone. Most provenances also show good growth on podzolic soils.

=== As an invasive species ===

&quot;Pinus nigra&quot; has become naturalised in a few areas of the US. In New Zealand it is considered an invasive species and noxious weed, along with lodgepole pine (&quot;P. contorta&quot;) and Scots pine (&quot;P. sylvestris&quot;), due to their habitat conversion nature in tussock grassland plant communities, shading out the native bunch grasses as their forest canopy develops.

==Uses==
===Lumber===
The timber of European black pine is similar to that of Scots pine (&quot;P. sylvestris&quot;) and red pine (&quot;P. resinosa&quot;), being moderately hard and straight-grained. It does however tend to be rougher, softer, and not as strong, due to its faster growth. It is used for general construction, fuel, and in paper manufacture.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Pinus nigra&quot; is important both as a timber tree and in plantations (primarily Corsican pine subsp.). Recently however, serious problems have occurred with red band needle blight disease, caused by the fungus &quot;Dothistroma septosporum&quot;, resulting in a major recent decline in forestry planting there. In the United States it is of low importance as a timber species.

In regard to Austrian pine, the fungus &quot;Dothistroma septosporum&quot; is widespread and rapidly spreading out of control throughout the United States. It is out of control and not recommended for landscaping, especially in groups or rows.

=== Ethnobotanical and ethnomedicinal use ===
In Turkey, this pine (subsp. pallasiana) was and is used in various ways, both topically and internally, as well as for construction and for livestock. Among its uses are curing acne, common cold, osteomyelitis, and viral infections; acting as an oral antiseptic; treating cracked hands and feet in the winter; and sealing wooden roofs.

===Ornamental use===
In the US and Canada, the European black pine is planted as a street tree, and as an ornamental tree in gardens and parks. Its value as a street tree is largely due to its resistance to salt spray (from road de-icing salt) and various industrial pollutants (including ozone), and its intermediate drought tolerance. In the UK the tree is planted as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens. It is planted with great success as far north as Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

In both the US and UK most of the specimens planted are from Austrian sources, the &quot;P. nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;nigra&quot; and &quot;P. nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;nigra&quot; var. &quot;nigra&quot; seed selections. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, when demand for natural trees was extremely high, its rapid growth, deep green color and low cost made it briefly a popular Christmas tree, but the extreme length of the needles (making it very difficult to decorate) soon led to its fall from favor, and it has long since been abandoned in the US for that purpose.

&quot;P. nigra&quot; is planted for windbreaks and shelterbelts in the US, recommended for windbreaks in the Northern Great Plains on medium to deep moist or upland soils.

<doc id="438974" wikidata="Q16845826" url="?curid=438974" title="Revenge (British band)">
<text>Revenge was a band formed by New Order bassist Peter Hook (vocals, bass, keyboards) and Lavolta Lakota and Rawhead singer Davyth Hicks (aka Dave Hicks) on guitar and vocals, together with Chris Jones (keyboards). Revenge formed during New Order&#x27;s hiatus in 1989-1990 and played their final gigs in January 1993. After their industrial rock/house music hybrid album &quot;One True Passion&quot; was written and recorded, the band was joined on stage by David Potts (bass and guitar) and Ashley Taylor on drums.

The band toured the first album worldwide playing gigs in Europe, North and South America and Japan in 1991. It was after the Japan tour that Hicks decided to leave, quoting &quot;musical differences&quot;, but more with the feeling of frustration over the direction of Revenge and his own desire to return to being lead singer. He formed Rawhead in Manchester and reformed the band in Scotland in 1993.

In May 1991 the band recruited new members Brian Whittaker (bass and guitar) and Mike Hedges (drums) who debuted at the Cities in The Park Festival. After completion of touring and promoting New Order&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Republic&quot;, Hook returned to Revenge with the intention of recording a new album. However, the band soon disintegrated and Hook retained the talents of only David Potts when later forming Monaco.

It has often been speculated that the band&#x27;s name referred to Hook seeking revenge on Bernard Sumner for the latter&#x27;s formation of the band Electronic with Johnny Marr. In fact, the name came from the word &quot;Revenge&quot; emblazoned on a leather jacket worn by George Michael in the video for his hit song, &quot;Faith&quot;.

<doc id="438978" wikidata="Q7156893" url="?curid=438978" title="Payroll tax">
<text>Payroll taxes are taxes imposed on employers or employees. They are usually calculated as a percentage of the salaries that employers pay their employees. By law, some payroll taxes are the responsibility of the employee and others fall on the employer, but almost all economists agree that the true economic incidence of a payroll tax is unaffected by this distinction, and falls largely or entirely on workers in the form of lower wages. Because payroll taxes fall exclusively on wages and not on returns to financial or physical investments, payroll taxes may contribute to underinvestment in human capital, such as higher education.

==National payroll tax systems==

===Australia===
The Australian federal government (ATO) requires withholding tax on employment income (payroll taxes of the first type), under a system known as pay-as-you-go (PAYG).

The individual states impose payroll taxes of the second type.

=== Austria ===
All Austrian residents are subjects to Austrian income tax. The tax base consists of their worldwide income, including: trade, business, profession, employment, investments and property. A person is considered a resident after a 6-month stay in Austria.

Non-residents are taxed only on income coming from Austrian source/activity.

The income tax is progressive, the percentage increases with amount of income in Euros.

Tax rates for personal income:

* &lt;11,693: 0%
* 11,694 - 19,134: 20%
* 19,135 - 32,075: 30%
* 32,076 - 62,080: 42%
* 62,081 - 93,120: 48%
* 93,121 - 1,000,000: 50%
* &gt;1,000,000: 55%

There are no taxes imposed on inheritance, gifts or estate in Austria. Austria has no luxury tax.

Acquisition of a real estate is taxed according to the value of estate. The rates are following:

* &lt;250,000: 0,5%
* 250,001 - 400,000: 2,0%
* &gt;400,000: 3,5%

==== Real estate tax ====
The real estate tax is paid annually. The rates vary for every municipality.

==== Social security contribution ====

==== Value-added tax ====
The value-added tax rate is 20% for every supply of goods provided to customers. For special goods listed below the rate is lower - either 13% or 10%. Products with a lower rate value-added tax are for example books, food or cultural events. There are exceptions for certain goods for which the rate is zero.

Value-added tax returns are filed monthly or quarterly by the 15th day of the following month.

==== Deductions ====
Employees are provided with a standard allowance of EUR 132 for any work related expenses. Receipts are required.

Expenses related to production or collection of income are usually considered as deductible. The expenses are for example training costs, work equipment and special work clothes, membership fees to certain organisations, etc.

There is a tax relief for homeworking. Employees may receive up to EUR 3 per day spent exclusively working from home and there is an upper limit of EUR 300 per year. If the amount paid by employer is lower than the maximum (EUR 300) then the employee has the right to include the difference as an income related expense.

Expenses for ergonomic office furniture are deductible and taken as income related expensive. This applies even for ergonomic office furniture purchased for home office, only if the employee works at least for 26 days per year at home. The limit is EUR 300 per year.

Special expenses: charitable contributions are deductible up to 10% of the current year&#x27;s taxable income.

Family bonus plus: reduces the calculated tax, annually EUR 2000 per child up to 18 years old, living in Austria. Can be split between both parents - then they are entitled to 50%. For children between 19 - 24 up to EUR 650 per year.

===Bermuda===

In Bermuda, payroll tax accounts for over a third of the annual national budget, making it the primary source of government revenue. The tax is paid by employers based on the total remuneration (salary and benefits) paid to all employees, at a standard rate of 14% (though, under certain circumstances, can be as low as 4.75%). Employers are allowed to deduct a small percentage of an employee&#x27;s pay (around 4%). Another tax, social insurance, is withheld by the employer.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, employers are required to withhold 11% of the employee&#x27;s wages for Social Security and a certain percentage as Income Tax (according to the applicable tax bracket). The employer is required to contribute an additional 20% of the total payroll value to the Social Security system. Depending on the company&#x27;s main activity, the employer must also contribute to federally funded insurance and educational programs.

There is also a required deposit of 8% of the employee&#x27;s wages (not withheld from him) into a bank account that can be withdrawn only when the employee is fired, or under certain other extraordinary circumstances, such as serious illness (called a &quot;Security Fund for Duration of Employment&quot;). All these contributions amount to a total tax burden of almost 40% of the payroll for the employer and 15% of the employee&#x27;s wages.

===Canada===
The Northwest Territories in Canada applies a payroll tax of 2% to all employees. It is an example of the second type of payroll tax, but unlike in other jurisdictions, it is paid directly by employees rather than employers. Unlike the first type of payroll tax as it is applied in Canada, though, there is no basic personal exemption below which employees are not required to pay the tax.

Ontario applies a health premium tax to all payrolls on a sliding scale up to $900 per year.

===China===
In China, the payroll tax is a specific tax that is paid to provinces and territories by employers, not by employees. The tax is deducted from the worker&#x27;s pay. The Chinese Government itself requires only one tax to be withheld from paychecks: the PAYG (or pay-as-you-go) tax, which includes medicare levies and insurances.

Tax calculations and contributions differ from city to city in China, and each city&#x27;s data will be updated yearly.

Taxable Income = Gross Salary – Social Benefits – ¥3,500 IIT = Taxable Income x Tax Rate – Quick Deduction Net Salary = Gross Salary – Social Benefits – IIT

===Croatia===
In Croatia, the payroll tax is composed of several items:
* national income tax on personal income (), which is applied incrementally with rates of 0% (personal exemption = 3800 HRK), 24% (3800-30000 HRK) and 36% (30000 HRK - )
* optional local surcharge on personal income (), which is applied by some cities and municipalities on the amount of national tax, currently up to 18% (in Zagreb)
* pension insurance (), universal 20%, for some people divided into two different funds, one of which is government-managed (15%) and the other is a personal pension fund (5%)
* health insurance (), universal 16.5%
* health insurance exemption exists for the population below 30 years of age as part of government policy to encourage youth employment.

=== Czech Republic ===

The income tax in the Czech Republic is progressive. The primary tax rate is 15% of gross income, but for an annual salary that is 48 times bigger than the average monthly salary (38.911 CZK in 2022, around 1.600 EUR), the rate is 23%. That applies only to the difference. The minimum wage to pay income tax is 27.840CZK in 2021 (approx. 1140EUR).

For people with trade certificates, the rate applies only to 40% of their revenue. The remaining 60% can be deducted as a standard expense. Freelancers also have to file an Income tax return every year.

Taxpayers can apply a few tax deductions, such as a deduction for a child (starting at approx. 600EUR annually in 2021), for being a student (approx. 160EUR in 2021), for a dependent spouse (approx. 1000EUR in 2021) and more.

Health and social insurance are mandatory and a part of a payroll tax. The health insurance rate is 13,5%. For employees with a salary higher than the minimum wage (16.200CZK in 2022, approximately 660EUR), 9% pay the employers, and only 4,5% pay the employees. Trade license workers pay it themselves. Categories that do not have to pay health and social insurance are, for example, students or people registered at the unemployment department. The social insurance rate is 31,5% for employees (6,5% paid by the employee and 25% by the employer) and 29,2% for freelancers.

The income tax makes up to half of the national income. The health and social insurance make another 30-40%.

===Finland===
In Finland, there are several payroll taxes:
*paid by employees on their income:
:* pension insurance fee (&quot;työeläkevakuutusmaksu&quot;): employees 17–68 years of age pay a 7,15% fee on their gross earned income
:* unemployment insurance fee (&quot;työttömyysvakuutusmaksu&quot;): employees 18–65 years of age&lt;ref name=&quot;FIN 555/1998 s12subs1 s12Asubs1para1.2&quot;&gt;The Act on the Financing of Unemployment Benefits (555/1998) section 12 subsection 1 (first link) provides that everyone employed in Finland is required to pay unemployment insurance fee. The section 12a subsection 1 paragraphs 1–2 (second link) provide for the age limit:
*&lt;/ref&gt; pay a 0.79% fee&lt;ref name=&quot;FIN 555/1998 s18subs1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; on their gross earned income
:* health insurance daily allowance contribution (&quot;sairausvakuutuksen päivärahamaksu&quot;): employees&lt;ref name=&quot;FIN 1224/2004 ch1s2subs1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 16–68 years of age&lt;ref name=&quot;FIN 1224/2004 ch18s5subs1.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; pay a 1.01% contribution on their entire gross earned income if it equals to, or exceeds €16,499&lt;ref name=&quot;FIN 1026/2023 s2subs1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In France, statutory payroll tax only covers employee and employer contributions to the social security system. Income tax deductions from the payroll are voluntary and may be requested by the employee, otherwise, employees are billed 2 mandatory income tax prepayments during the year directly by the tax authority (set at 1/3 of the prior year&#x27;s final tax bill). Employee payroll tax is made up of assigned taxes for the three branches of the social security system and includes both basic and supplementary coverage. Different percentages apply depending on thresholds that are multiples of the social security earnings ceiling (in 2012 = 36,372 euro per year).

Contributions for salaries between the minimum wage and 1.6 times the minimum wage are eligible to relief (known as Fillon relief) of up to 28 percentage points of employer contributions, effectively halving employer non-wage costs.
===Germany===
German employers are obliged to withhold wage tax on a monthly basis. The wage tax withheld will be qualified as prepayment of the income tax of the employee in case the taxpayer files an annual income tax return. The actual tax rate depends on the personal income of the employee and the tax class the employee (and his/her partner) has chosen. The choice of tax class is only important for withholding tax, and therefore for immediately disposable income. The choice of tax class has no effect on tax refunds.

In addition to income tax withheld, employees and employers in Germany must pay contributions to finance social security benefits. The social security system consists of four insurances, for which the contribution will be (nearly) equally shared between employer and employee (old age insurance, unemployment insurance, health insurance and nursing care insurance). Contributions are payable only on wages up to the social security threshold:
In addition, there are some insurances which are covered by the employee only (accident insurance, insolvency insurance, contribution to the maternity allocation, contribution for sick pay allocation for small companies).
The following table shows employee and employer contributions by category for the year 2015.

===Greece===
An employer is obligated to deduct tax at source from an employee and to make additional contributions to social security as in many other EU member states. The employer&#x27;s contribution amounts to 28.06% of the salary. The employee&#x27;s contribution is 16%. 

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, salaries tax is capped at 15%. Depending on income, employers fall into different tax brackets.

===Sweden===
In 2018, the Swedish social security contribution paid by the employer is 31.42 percent, calculated on top of the employee&#x27;s salary. The percentage is lower for old employees. The other type of Swedish payroll tax is the income tax withheld (PAYE), which consists of municipal, county, and, for higher income brackets, state tax. In most municipalities, the income tax comes to approximately 32 percent, with the two higher income brackets also paying a state tax of 20 or 25 percent respectively. The combination of the two types is a total marginal tax effect of 52 to 60 percent.

According to a 2019 study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot;, a large employee payroll tax cut for young workers did not lead to increases in wages for young workers, but it did lead to an increase in employment, capital, sales, and profits of firms with many young workers.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, pay as you earn (PAYE) income tax and Employees&#x27; National Insurance contributions are examples of the first kind of payroll tax, while Employers&#x27; National Insurance contributions are an example of the second kind of payroll tax. There are currently (February 2022) five PAYE income tax bands in Scotland and four elsewhere; see for details. Both income tax and National Insurance contributions are paid only on income above a lower threshold. This threshold is progressively eliminated for the highest earners, beginning at £100,000 per year.

===United States===

In the United States, payroll taxes are also called employment taxes by the Internal Revenue Service.

In the United States, payroll taxes are assessed by the federal government, some of the 50 states and numerous cities. These taxes are imposed on employers and employees and on various compensation bases and are collected and paid to the taxing jurisdiction by the employers. Most jurisdictions imposing payroll taxes require reporting quarterly and annually in most cases, and electronic reporting is generally required for all but small employers.

====Social Security and Medicare taxes====


Federal social insurance taxes are imposed on employers and employees, ordinarily consisting of a tax of 12.4% of wages up to an annual wage maximum ($118,500 in wages, for a maximum contribution of $14,694 in 2016) for Social Security and a tax of 2.9% (half imposed on employer and half withheld from the employee&#x27;s pay) of all wages for Medicare. The Social Security tax is divided into 6.2% that is visible to employees (the &quot;employee contribution&quot;) and 6.2% that is visible only to employers (the &quot;employer&#x27;s contribution&quot;). For the years 2011 and 2012, the employee&#x27;s contribution had been temporarily reduced to 4.2%, while the employer&#x27;s portion remained at 6.2%, but Congress allowed the rate to return to 6.2% for the individual in 2013. To the extent an employee&#x27;s portion of the 6.2% tax exceeded the maximum by reason of multiple employers, the employee is entitled to a refundable tax credit upon filing an income tax return for the year.

====Income tax withholding====
Federal, state, and local withholding taxes are required in those jurisdictions imposing an income tax. Employers having contact with the jurisdiction must withhold the tax from wages paid to their employees in those jurisdictions. Computation of the amount of tax to withhold is performed by the employer based on representations by the employee regarding their tax status on IRS Form W-4.

Amounts of income tax so withheld must be paid to the taxing jurisdiction, and are available as refundable tax credits to the employees. Income taxes withheld from payroll are not final taxes, merely prepayments. Employees must still file income tax returns and self assess tax, claiming amounts withheld as payments.

====Unemployment taxes====
Employers are subject to unemployment taxes by the federal and all state governments. The tax is a percentage of taxable wages with a cap. The tax rate and cap vary by jurisdiction and by employer&#x27;s industry and experience rating. For 2009, the typical maximum tax per employee was under $1,000. Some states also impose unemployment, disability insurance, or similar taxes on employees.

====Reporting and payment====
Employers must report payroll taxes to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction in the manner each jurisdiction provides. Quarterly reporting of aggregate income tax withholding and Social Security taxes is required in most jurisdictions. Employers must file reports of aggregate unemployment tax quarterly and annually with each applicable state, and annually at the Federal level.

Each employer is required to provide each employee an annual report on IRS Form W-2 of wages paid and Federal, state and local taxes withheld. A copy must be sent to the IRS, and some state governments also require a copy. These are due by January 31 and February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically), respectively, following the calendar year in which wages are paid. The Form W-2 constitutes proof of payment of tax for the employee.

Employers are required to pay payroll taxes to the taxing jurisdiction under varying rules, in many cases within one banking day. Payment of Federal and many state payroll taxes is required to be made by electronic funds transfer if certain dollar thresholds are met, or by deposit with a bank for the benefit of the taxing jurisdiction.

====Penalties====
Failure to timely and properly pay federal payroll taxes results in an automatic penalty of 2% to 10%. This is called the Trust Fund Recovery Penalty. Similar state and local penalties apply. Failure to properly file monthly or quarterly returns may result in additional penalties. Failure to file Forms W-2 results in an automatic penalty of up to $50 per form not timely filed. State and local penalties vary by jurisdiction.

A particularly severe penalty applies where federal income tax withholding and Social Security taxes are not paid to the IRS. The penalty of up to 100% of the amount not paid can be assessed against the employer entity as well as any person (such as a corporate officer) having control or custody of the funds from which payment should have been made.

<doc id="438979" wikidata="Q1141754" url="?curid=438979" title="HMS Illustrious (R06)">
<text>HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; was a light aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy and the second of three ships constructed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She was the fifth warship and second aircraft carrier to bear the name &quot;Illustrious&quot;, and was affectionately known to her crew as &quot;Lusty&quot;. In 1982, the conflict in the Falklands necessitated that &quot;Illustrious&quot; be completed and rushed south to join her sister ship and the veteran carrier . To this end, she was brought forward by three months for completion at Swan Hunter Shipyard, then commissioned on 20 June 1982 at sea en route to Portsmouth Dockyard to take on board extra stores and crew. She arrived in the Falklands to relieve &quot;Invincible&quot; on 28 August 1982 in a steam past. Returning to the United Kingdom, she was not formally commissioned into the fleet until 20 March 1983. After her South Atlantic deployment, she was deployed on Operation Southern Watch in Iraq, then Operation Deny Flight in Bosnia during the 1990s and Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone in 2000. An extensive re-fit during 2002 prevented her from involvement in the 2003 Iraq War, but she was returned to service in time to assist British citizens trapped by the 2006 Lebanon War.

Following the retirement of her fixed-wing British Aerospace Harrier II aircraft in 2010, &quot;Illustrious&quot; operated as one of two Royal Navy helicopter carriers. After 32 years&#x27; service, the oldest ship in the Royal Navy&#x27;s active fleet was formally decommissioned on 28 August 2014 even though she would not be replaced until &#x27;s commissioning in 2017. Despite the UK Ministry of Defence&#x27;s announcement in 2012 that, once decommissioned, &quot;Illustrious&quot; would be preserved for the nation, in 2016 she was sold and towed to Turkish company Leyal for scrapping.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Illustrious&quot;, the second of the three &quot;Invincible&quot;-class aircraft carriers, was laid down at Swan Hunter on the River Tyne on 7 October 1976 and launched by Princess Margaret on 1 December 1978. As the ship neared the end of its fitting out period, the Falklands War broke out. As a consequence, work on &quot;Illustrious&quot; was greatly sped up. The war was won before &quot;Illustrious&quot; could be finished, but she did perform a useful service in the aftermath. Until the RAF airfield on the Falkland Islands was repaired, air defence of the area was the responsibility of the Fleet Air Arm. After &quot;Hermes&quot; returned to the UK, &quot;Invincible&quot; remained on station in the South Atlantic until September 1982. To relieve &quot;Invincible&quot;, the newly completed &quot;Illustrious&quot; was rapidly deployed, with 809 Naval Air Squadron (Sea Harrier) and 814 Naval Air Squadron (Sea King) embarked. Additionally, a pair of Sea Kings from 824 Naval Air Squadron were attached to the air group, which had been converted to operate in the AEW role. So rapidly was &quot;Illustrious&quot; deployed that she was commissioned while at sea. Rear Admiral Derek Reffell, Flag Officer, Third Flotilla, commanded the relief task group from &quot;Illustrious&quot; during this period. After the RAF airfield was repaired, &quot;Illustrious&quot; returned to the UK for a full shakedown cruise and workup period, and was formally commissioned on 20 March 1983.

==Operational history==

===1983–1990===
The carrier saw no further action during the remainder of the 1980s, but continued to be a valuable asset for the Royal Navy in showing the flag and participating in exercises all around the world. During those years, the ship received several enhancements during refits, including a steeper ski-jump to enable the Harriers in the air wing to take-off with a larger payload. During an &#x27;Extended Dockyard Assisted Maintenance Period (EDAMP)&#x27;, numerous modifications were made to the ship including the removal of her Sea Dart missile defences at a cost of twelve million pounds. This allowed for extra deck space that enables her to carry up to 22 aircraft, including the Harrier GR7.

On 3 April 1986 she suffered a catastrophic gearbox failure which almost saw the end of the vessel&#x27;s naval career. Just starting out on her &quot;fly the flag&quot; around the globe trip, at about 00:30 whilst reaching full engine revs, due to conflicting gearbox tolerances causing friction and heat it ignited the oil vapour within the gearbox which exploded causing a fire lasting well over four hours. Sea Harriers were flown off whilst firefighting continued below decks, and one Sea King took the only casualty ashore (smoke inhalation) Although it was a serious fire it was contained within the forward gearbox room and vertical trunking. Additional vessels including the destroyer HMS &quot;Nottingham&quot; and &quot;Ferry Sea Leopard&quot; were in attendance, however &quot;Illustrious&quot; crew managed to extinguish the fire and she returned to Portsmouth under her own power provided by her aft engine room. Although the ship went to emergency stations at no time was any abandonment considered. There was no loss of life or serious injury, but the trip was put off for several months whilst the ship was taken out of service for extensive repairs. In due course once repairs were completed &quot;Illustrious&quot; sailed directly to the Far East arriving at Singapore to resume the Eastern end of the Global 86 deployment.

===1990–2002===
During the 1990s, the main task of the aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy was helping to maintain the no-fly zone over Bosnia during the war there. All three of the navy&#x27;s carriers rotated through the area. In 1998 she operated in the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch, the Anglo-Saudi-American enforcement of the no-fly-zone over Southern Iraq.

In 2000 &quot;Illustrious&quot; led Task Group 342.1, a naval task force comprising HM ships — , , , — and numerous Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships in Operation Palliser, which was aimed at restoring peace and stability to Sierra Leone.

A combat deployment for the ship took place in 2001. A large British exercise, Saif Sareea II took place in Oman in late 2001. During the exercise, the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center took place. &quot;Illustrious&quot; remained in theatre while other elements of the task force returned to the United Kingdom. &quot;Illustrious&quot; had elements of the Royal Marines on board, ready for possible combat operations in Afghanistan. No deployment was made before &quot;Illustrious&quot; was relieved by &quot;Ocean&quot; in early 2002 and returned to Portsmouth after seven months at sea.

===2003–2005===

In mid-2003, the ship underwent a further refit at Rosyth Dockyard. This refit involved the total rebuild of the ski jump, the adding of better communications and reconfiguring the ship so that it can be more quickly switched between the light aircraft carrier and helicopter carrier roles. The refit should have enable her to carry on until 2014, when it was expected that the first of the s would come into service. &quot;Illustrious&quot; returned to Portsmouth following the completion of the refit in December 2004.

She was re-dedicated in 2005, and following the death of the ship&#x27;s original sponsor Princess Margaret, her daughter Lady Sarah Chatto agreed to attend in a new role as &quot;ship&#x27;s friend&quot;.

===2006===
&quot;Illustrious&quot; along with helped in the evacuation of British citizens from Beirut as a result of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon crisis. Later that year, as part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Remembrance Day activities, &quot;Illustrious&quot; sailed up the River Thames on Friday 10 November 2006. She was moored at Wood Wharf, a few hundred yards upriver from the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, London, until Wednesday 15 November. Whilst there, the Falklands War commemorative events in 2007 were announced on board her.

===2007===
&quot;Illustrious&quot; carried out two weeks of fixed wing flying serials exercises in the North Sea off Hartlepool in March 2007, during which seven GR9 Harriers from No. 4 Squadron RAF, Joint Force Harrier touched down on her flight-deck. Also during these exercises, seven of her crew had to be airlifted to hospital in Middlesbrough on 13 March suffering from fume inhalation and throat and eye irritation after an accident with chemicals in cleaning a junior ratings&#x27; toilet area. &quot;Illustrious&quot; sailed on to Portsmouth, where they rejoined her on leaving hospital.
From 25 to 30 May 2007, after an exercise in the Baltic Sea, &quot;Illustrious&quot; was the first British aircraft carrier ever to visit Tallinn, Estonia. The visit provided rest for the ship&#x27;s crew after the Baltic exercise, acted as a diplomatic visit, and also involved naval and air exercises with the Estonian Defence Forces.

Next, in July 2007, &quot;Illustrious&quot; took part in a US-led Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFX) off the eastern coast of the United States (for which she hosted 14 US Harrier jets and 200 US Marines) before returning to Portsmouth the following month. On 10 July 2007, during the JTFX, a MV-22 Osprey landed aboard &quot;Illustrious&quot;, the first time a V-22 had landed on a non-U.S. vessel.

===2008===
The carrier set sail from Portsmouth on 21 January 2008 as head of the multi-national Task Group 328.01, under Operation Orion 08, which from January to May 2008 carried out exercises and diplomatic visits to twenty ports in the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East, and south-east Asia. However, on 23 January, whilst still off the coast of southern England, she sailed back to Portsmouth for repairs to a minor fault in a meat freezer. It was felt to be important to repair this before sailing to a warmer climate, and Navy spokesman Anton Hanney stated that flying in an emergency plumber whilst she was underway would be more expensive than turning back whilst &quot;Illustrious&quot; was still in the English Channel. She sailed back out at 1pm on 24 January and made up the lost 24 hours. Her ports of call included Valletta, Malta 26–29 February 2008.

This 2008 assignment was filmed and shown on Channel 5 as the six part TV documentary &quot;Warship&quot; transmitted on Mondays from 19 May 2008. This documentary aimed to show life on board the aging carrier in much the same way that was shown in the 1976 series &quot;Sailor&quot;. &quot;Illustrious&quot; was commanded by Captain Steve Chick CBE BSc, who had also commanded during the 2005 BBC documentary &quot;Shipmates&quot;.

By the end of July, she had returned to Portsmouth where &quot;Illustrious&quot; took part in the 2008 navy open-day. On board was a full size model of the F-35 Joint Combat Aircraft which will replace the Harriers then used by the ship. &quot;Illustrious&quot; was the only aircraft carrier to be part of the event, although the inactive was also visible to the public.

On 17 October she, along with , sailed into Liverpool where she was open to the public on Saturday 18 October. On 4 November she moored at Greenwich, arriving to take central part in the Royal Navy&#x27;s remembrance week with the F-35 mock-up still on deck.

===2009===

On 7 May 2009 she returned to Greenwich to serve as the centre piece of the Royal Navy&#x27;s celebration of a century of British naval aviation; on board were examples of all the Navy&#x27;s operational helicopters.

Beginning on 8 June, she took part in the exercise Loyal Arrow in northern Sweden. The exercise lasted until 16 June. On 17 June 2009, she arrived in Tallinn. On 27 June 2009 she was in the harbour of Oslo, Norway.

On 22 October 2009 she arrived at Liverpool for a six-day visit and moored at the cruise terminal. There was a fly past along The River Mersey on 23 October as part of its celebrations to mark that year&#x27;s centenary of naval aviation. &quot;Illustrious&quot; was open to members of the public on 25–26 October and departed Liverpool on 27 October 2009.

===2010–2016===
As part of Strategic Defence and Security Review, and in addition to the retirement of the Harrier force and &quot;Illustrious&quot;″s sister ship , it was announced that a short study would be carried out to determine whether &quot;Illustrious&quot; or &quot;Ocean&quot; was the most viable helicopter platform. The decision was subsequently made to retain &quot;Ocean&quot; for the longer term. In May 2011 &quot;Illustrious&quot; was made operational after a £40 million refit, and she was handed back to the fleet after sea trials in late July 2011
She took over the helicopter carrier role while &quot;Ocean&quot; underwent a planned refit, due for completion by 2014; &quot;Illustrious&quot; was then withdrawn from service. The Ministry of Defence also announced on 12 September 2012 that &quot;Illustrious&quot;, as the last of the &quot;Invincible&quot;-class aircraft carriers, would be preserved as a memorial &quot;in recognition of the service given by these ships in protecting the UK over the last 30 years&quot;.

In March 2012, &quot;Illustrious&quot; took part in Exercise &#x27;Cold Response&#x27; with , and other Royal Navy vessels. This was a NATO winter war games exercise conducted in northern Norway, where she tested her capabilities as a helicopter carrier. &quot;Illustrious&quot; was awarded the Bambara Trophy, the trophy is given to a unit each year with the best flight safety record, during &#x27;Cold Response&#x27;. Following &#x27;Cold Response&#x27; she then took part in Exercise &#x27;Joint Warrior&#x27; with vessels from Norway, the Netherlands and the United States and Cougar 12 in the Mediterranean. In May 2013, as part of the 70th Anniversary of The Battle of the Atlantic Commemorations, &quot;Illustrious&quot; sailed up the River Thames and was moored at Greenwich where she was used as the venue for a charity reception in aid of the Royal Navy&#x27;s aviation heritage.

She was deployed as part of Exercise COUGAR 13 during the autumn of 2013 along with , , and six RFA vessels. She was diverted away from the COUGAR 13 task group in December 2013 to assist in Typhoon Haiyan disaster relief efforts in the Philippines and eventually returned to Portsmouth on 10 January 2014.

&quot;Illustrious&quot; was briefly berthed at Rosyth in the first week of July 2014, in a dock adjacent to , which was formally named on 4 July 2014; &quot;Illustrious&quot; left Rosyth the following day and arrived back at HMNB Portsmouth on 22 July at the end of active service. By then the oldest operational RN warship, she was decommissioned at HMNB Portsmouth on 28 August 2014.

The Royal Navy had hoped to preserve the ship, and in August 2014 it was reported that Kingston upon Hull and two other cities had submitted bids for her. However, these bids were judged to be unviable. On 6 May 2016, the MOD&#x27;s Disposal Authority advertised the potential sale of &quot;Illustrious&quot; for recycling only and three months later the sale to a Turkish scrapyard was confirmed.

The former HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; left Portsmouth under tow bound for Turkey on 7 December 2016.

<text>The cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea) is a small songbird in the family Parulidae. It is a long-distance migrant, breeding in eastern North American hardwood forests. In the non-breeding season, it winters on the eastern slope of the Andes in South America, preferring subtropical forests.

It displays strong sexual dichromatism: Adult males have cerulean blue and white , with a black necklace across the breast and black streaks on the back and flanks. Females and immature birds have bluish-green upperparts, a pale stripe over the eye, no streaking, and are yellow below. All have two white wing bars and a thin, pointed .

The cerulean warbler is insectivorous and predominantly feeds on insect larvae, though it also takes winged insects. It forages for prey and nests high in forest canopies. Individuals are strongly territorial; males will defend areas of forests. Males arrive on breeding grounds about one to two weeks earlier than females. Breeding and incubation take place from late May to early June.

The species is rated as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)&#x27;s Red List of endangered species, indicating it is under risk of becoming vulnerable in the near future. The population of the cerulean warbler has been under rapid decline, though in recent years this decline has slowed. Deforestation in its non-breeding range continues to reduce its available habitat.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The cerulean warbler was described in 1810 as &quot;Sylvia cerulea&quot; by ornithologist Alexander Wilson. In 1811, Wilson described the female as a separate species, &quot;Sylvia rara&quot;. It was later realized that the two taxa were conspecific, and in 1838 the biologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte merged them together. In 1842, it was placed in the new genus &quot;Dendroica&quot; introduced by the ornithologist George Robert Gray. In 2011, &quot;Dendroica&quot; was merged into the genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; after molecular studies showed that the two genera were not well delineated&quot;.&quot; The change was implemented as part of the &quot;Fifty-second Supplement to the AOU Checklist of North American Birds&quot;. The genus name &quot;Setophaga&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;ses&quot;, &quot;moth&quot;, and &quot;phagos&quot;, &quot;eating&quot;. The specific name, &quot;cerulea&quot;, is derived from &quot;caeruleus,&quot; Latin for &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;azure&quot;.

Between 1897 and 1903, it was believed that the name &quot;Sylvia cærulea&quot; (an unjustified emendation of &quot;cerulea&quot;) had been preoccupied by the blue-gray gnatcatcher, &quot;Polioptila cærulea&quot;, as ornithologist John Latham had in 1793 moved the latter species to &quot;Sylvia&quot;. Therefore, the name &quot;Sylvia rara&quot;, an obsolete name for the female cerulean warbler, was accepted as &quot;Dendroica rara&quot; in the &quot;Eighth Supplement to the AOU Checklist of North American Birds&quot;. However, in 1903, it was found that the change was invalid, and the accepted name reverted to &quot;Dendroica cerulea&quot;.

The cerulean warbler&#x27;s close relatives within the genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; include the Blackburnian warbler (&quot;S. fusca&quot;), blackpoll warbler (&quot;S. striata&quot;), chestnust-sided warbler, Wilson&#x27;s warbler (&quot;S. pensylvanica&quot;) and bay-breasted warbler (&quot;S. castanea)&quot;. Hybridisations with the northern parula (&quot;S. americana&quot;) have been observed, indicating a close relationship.

The following cladograms show the position of the cerulean warbler among its closest relatives according to Lovette et al. 2010 (left), and Baiz et al. 2021 (right):

==Description==
The cerulean warbler is one of the smallest &quot;Setophaga&quot; wood-warblers, about long, weighing , and having a wingspan of . Males are slightly larger than females, and older males tend to also be larger. Wing chord measures , while the tail is long. The culmen, or upper edge of the beak, measures long, wide and height.

The cerulean warbler is strongly sexually dichromatic. Adult males are a deep, cerulean blue over the entire back, and are white below. There are prominent dark streaks across the flanks. A &quot;necklace&quot; or breast band, a line of color across the neck, varies from blue to near black. Older individuals have stronger colors across the entire body, including brighter whites, darker streaking, and wider breast bands. Adult females are yellow underneath, while the back and have a blue-green tint. Females also possess a distinct pale supercilium, or eye stripe, just above the eye.

Immature individuals are generally similar to adult females, though the back may be more yellowish. All fledged individuals, regardless of their age or sex, have two prominent white wing-bars and white spots on the tail.

The beak and legs of the cerulean warbler vary in color depending on an individual&#x27;s age and sex. Adult males have a black beak, with the lower half a slightly lighter dark grey. Adult females have dark grey beaks that may become dark brown on the lower half. Recently fledged birds have a brownish beak. Adults have black legs and brown irises, while juveniles have dark brown legs and dark brown irises. Hatchlings have pink bare parts, including the beak and legs, and black eyes.

The song is a buzzed accelerating &quot;zray zray zray zray zeeee&quot;. The primary call is a buzzy, metallic &quot;zzee&quot;. Males use their songs to attract potential mates and to mark out their territory. Cerulean warblers are also capable of imitating the songs of other birds alongside their typical song. Females rarely sing, but often call when nesting. An alarm call is used to signal the arrival of a predator or another bird threatening the nest.

==Distribution and habitat==
The cerulean warbler&#x27;s preferred summer habitat consists of large, unfragmented mature deciduous hardwood forests. Nesting takes place in the top canopy, often above heights of , and territories are typically about . Foraging is done throughout the mid to high canopy. Generally, to support a population of cerulean warblers, a forested area of greater than is required. Riparian areas are commonly selected.

The breeding range extends from southern Tennessee to southern Ontario, and is bounded in the east by the Atlantic Ocean and on the west by the Great Plains. The majority of the population breeds in forests of the Appalachian mountains, with smaller numbers in forests throughout the United States and Canada. Historically, the cerulean warbler was common to abundant as far south as Alabama and Mississippi, but loss of habitat in these southern regions has caused the centre of its breeding range to shift northwards.

The cerulean warbler migrates distances of over between its breeding and non-breeding ranges. In the spring, it takes an overland route through Central America, passing over water only to cross the Gulf of Mexico at the Yucatán Peninsula. In the autumn, it may overfly the Caribbean Sea, crossing from Florida to Cuba onto continental South America. Migration takes from 40–70 days; much of this time is made up of stopovers, where birds will remain at one individual location for 2–18 days.

The non-breeding range covers a broad area of northern South America, and extends southwards along the Andes mountains. Individuals have been found as far south as Bolivia, while in the north it is often found throughout Colombia and Venezuela. The cerulean warbler prefers tall forest; its occurrence is therefore strongly correlated with the presence of old-growth subtropical forests or shade coffee plantations. It is found at altitudes of in its non-breeding range.

The cerulean warbler has been recorded as a vagrant to Iceland. It has also been recorded in Brazil, far outside of its range.

==Behaviour==

=== Feeding ===

The cerulean warbler forages throughout the forest canopy, predominantly at middle to top layers. It hops from branch to branch, gleaning small soft-bodied insects from leaves and twigs. In the non-breeding season, it may also glean insects from flowers. Its preferred prey consists of butterfly and moth (lepidopteran larvae), though it supplements its diet with winged insects. In its non-breeding range, it preferentially forages on trees of the genus &quot;Inga.&quot;

Foraging is vertically segregated; males tend to forage at somewhat higher elevations in the canopy than females. The difference in height average is about . They stay with mixed-species flocks as they forage, sharing spaces with species such as the American redstart (&quot;Setophaga ruticilla&quot;), Blackburnian warbler, and Tennessee warbler (&quot;Leiothlypis peregrina&quot;). The other species forage at different heights and substrates, preventing competition. At the high elevations and relatively sparser vegetation that the cerulean warbler prefers, the gleaning technique it uses is more effective than aerial maneuvring. Foraging locations tend to be lower than nest placements.

=== Breeding ===
The cerulean warbler is monogamous. Its short breeding season allows it to produce one brood a year. Individuals are very aggressive towards others of the same sex during the breeding season. Typical conflict comprises the use of song to mark a territory, as well as physical conflict such as attacks in which individuals may fall from heights of . Female cerulean warblers have been observed to attack other females and destroy their eggs.

Nest construction takes about 7 days. The female lays from 3 to 5 eggs over the course of about 7 days, incubation lasts for around 12 days, and nestlings remain altricial for an average of 11 days. Only the female broods the nest, but the male will frequently provide food for the female and for the young. The female occasionally responds with a call. During nesting, the female vocalizes a &quot;chip&quot; call whenever it leaves the nest. In response, the male returns to the nest, guarding it from a nearby perch. 

Extra-pair copulation, in which mating occurs outside of a monogamous pair, is known to occur. Based on blood analyses, several young may be sired by a different male than that which occupies the territory on which the young are found, making it likely that males travelling outside of their own territories seek extra-pair copulations. Males engage in mate guarding, in which they will remain close to the mate during periods of foraging, nest building, or nest site selection. The male will also frequently sing a &quot;whisper song&quot;; the female occasionally responds with a call.

During nest incubation, and when young are in the nestling stage, the female may also sing. The song, a more complex variation of the typical nest call, is a metallic &quot;zee zeet zee zeet zeet&quot;.

Both males and females are involved in nest construction and together choose a nest site. Sites are usually located on horizontal branches high in the forest canopy, and are usually shaded by vegetation. The cerulean warbler prefers to nest over an empty space where there are no branches for or more. The nest itself is made from tree bark, grasses, and lichens, woven together using caterpillar silk and spider thread. If a nesting attempt is unsuccessful, individuals will often reuse materials from an old nest, especially binding elements. Cerulean warblers have been observed to construct &quot;double-decker&quot; nests, in which a new nest is overlaid atop an existing one. Nearly all known nests have been in deciduous trees, but nesting has been recorded in pine trees in southern Indiana.

After the eggs have hatched, nestlings are fed by their parents, mainly consuming lepidopteran larvae. The fledglings become independent about 12 days after leaving the nest. Survival rates range from 34–62% for the fledgling stage of development. Newly fledged birds are often killed by chipmunks through predation. Young individuals have somewhat different feeding patterns than adults, preferring riparian areas with relatively little foliage.

=== Predators and parasites ===
The cerulean warbler&#x27;s preferred nesting sites, located high in the forest canopy, reduce the prevalence of nest predation. However, its eggs and young still fall victim to predators such as raccoons, squirrels, chipmunks, snakes, and even other birds, in particular blue jays (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;).

The cerulean warbler is known to be parasitized by blood parasites such as &quot;Haemoproteus paruli.&quot; Nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;) occurs, but is less common in the dense interior canopy the cerulean warbler prefers.

==Status and conservation==

The cerulean warbler is currently rated a near threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is the fastest declining Neotropical migrant songbird. Among the many threats it faces, its wintering habitat in the northern Andes is dwindling rapidly. Cerulean warblers depend on shade coffee plantations for the mature forest habitat they require. This traditional farming technique faces pressure from fluctuating world coffee prices, and many tracts of shade coffee are being converted to higher-yield sun coffee or other crops.

In fragmented forest areas, the cerulean warbler is vulnerable to nest parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird. Historically, the preferred habitat of tall forest interiors protected it from brood parasitism, but deforestation has caused the cerulean warbler to often choose nest locations accessible to cowbirds.

This bird&#x27;s numbers are declining faster than any other warbler species in the USA; its population in 2006 was less than one-fifth of what it was 40 years before. The American Bird Conservancy (ABC) is working with its Colombian partner, Fundación ProAves, to protect wintering habitat for cerulean warblers and other migratory songbirds. In 2008, the partnership created the Cerulean Warbler Bird Reserve, the first protected area created for a neotropical migrant. In an effort to advance protection of the cerulean warbler, ABC and its South American partners (Fundacion ProAves, ECOAN and Fundacion Jocotoco), in 2009 produced a Cerulean Warbler Wintering Ground Conservation Plan.

==In art and culture==

Artist and ornithologist John James Audubon illustrates the cerulean warbler in &quot;Birds of America&quot; (London, 1827–38) as Plate 48, where two birds are shown perched in a dahoon holly bush. The painting was originally produced in 1822, and engraved and colored by Robert Havell&#x27;s London workshops. The original watercolor by Audubon was purchased by the New-York Historical Society, where it remains as of 2022.

The novelist Jonathan Franzen uses the cerulean warbler as a plot device in his 2010 novel &quot;Freedom&quot;.

In San Vicente, Colombia, the cerulean warbler is commemorated in an annual migratory bird festival.

The Man in the Yellow Hat publishes a book about the cerulean warbler in the episode &quot;The Big Picture&quot; of &quot;Curious George&quot;.

<text>Casimir IV (, ; 1351 – 2 January 1377) was a duke of Pomerania in Pomerania-Stolp since 1374.

== Life ==
Casimir was the son of Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania and Elizabeth of Poland. His maternal grandfather Casimir III the Great, the last king of Poland from the Piast dynasty, had no sons and brought him up at his court. After his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1370, young Casimir initially became his partial successor, as the last will gave him lands of Dobrzyń, Bydgoszcz, Kruszwica, Złotów and Wałcz as fiefs. Yet, his ambitions were soon thwarted by Louis I of Hungary, who became the next king of Poland on the grounds of earlier pacts, and nullified the Piast&#x27;s last will. Duke Casimir only held the land of Dobrzyń as a temporary fief.

In 1360, Casimir married his first wife Kenna of Lithuania. She was the daughter of Algirdas and Uliana Alexandrovna of Tver, raised in the Eastern Orthodox faith. With her marriage, she joined the Roman Catholic Church and was baptised again under the name &quot;Johanna&quot;. She died on 27 April 1368, leaving no children.

After a year, Casimir IV married his second wife Margaret of Masovia. She was the daughter of Siemowit III of Masovia and his first wife Euphemia of Opava. They had no children. After Casimir’s death of wounds (received in fighting Władysław the White on behalf of King Louis), she married Henry VII, Duke of Lubin and Brzeg.

Although after the death of his father Bogislaw V in 1374 Casimir IV stayed several times in Pomerania-Stolp, most of the time he spent in Bydgoszcz; with his death in 1377 his fiefs fell back to Poland.

<doc id="438984" wikidata="Q7437806" url="?curid=438984" title="Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region">
<text>The [[Scottish Junior Football Association]], West Region was one of three regions of the SJFA which organised its own distinct league and cup competitions.

The SJFA used to be split into six regions, but in 2002 they decided to reform into three (East, North and West) to try to ensure more games between the top clubs and hence increase their revenues. The region covered an area from Girvan in South Ayrshire to Denny in Central Scotland.

In 2020, the region was abolished, as all 63 clubs in the region decided to depart and join the newly-founded West of Scotland Football League.

==History==
===Foundation===
Although the West Region was formed by the amalgamation of the Central and Ayrshire regions in 2002, a West of Scotland Junior FA had existed since the end of the Intermediate dispute in 1931 and administered the West of Scotland Cup since that time. The first phase of rationalisation in 1968 saw the Central Junior Football League (based around greater Glasgow and essentially a continuation of the Glasgow Junior Football League from 1895) merge with the even older Lanarkshire Junior Football League (1891) to create the Central region. The Western Junior League became the Ayrshire region, with Neilston Juniors and Dunoon Athletic transferring to the Central region.

===Structure===
From 2002 to 2018, the league set-up in the region was a combined top division, officially known as the &quot;SJFA West of Scotland Region Super League Premier Division&quot; (12 teams), with the West of Scotland Region Super League First Division (14 teams) below. There were two district leagues below that provided the First Division with two clubs each at the end of the season. These corresponded to the former two regions that combined to create the new West region: there was a Central District League (with two divisions) and an Ayrshire District League, with the four teams relegated from the First Division assigned to their historic region. Although Ayrshire only had one division, clubs were also promoted between the two divisions of the Central District League.

In 2017 West Region clubs voted to organise all leagues on a regionwide basis and as a result, the Super League Premier Division was rebranded as the West Region Premiership for the 2018–19 season and featured 16 clubs. Clubs were relegated to a rebranded Championship also made up of 16 teams. The Ayrshire and Central district leagues were scrapped and replaced by League One and Two consisting of 16 and 15 teams respectively.

===End of an era===
In 2020, as part of a long process of negotiation to form an integrated footballing pyramid structure, all 63 West Region Junior clubs decided to depart and join the newly-founded West of Scotland Football League, a feeder to the Lowland Football League.

==Member clubs==
Towards the end of the 2019–20 campaign, the coronavirus pandemic interrupted the season and caused the West Region leagues to be curtailed, with champions later declared on a &#x27;points per game&#x27; basis by the West Region management committee. At that time there were 63 member clubs in the setup.

==Cup competitions==
The West Region organised several cup competitions for member clubs:
* West of Scotland Cup: This was a knockout tournament for all West Region clubs. The competition originated as the Scottish Intermediate Cup in 1927–28 and was renamed The West of Scotland Cup following the ending of the Intermediate dispute in 1931.
*Sectional League Cup: Introduced for the 2018–19 season as a combination of the Central and Ayrshire sectional league cups, clubs competed in eight regional groups with the group winners progressing to the knockout stages.
*Evening Times Champions Cup: This was a knockout tournament played at the end of the season between the winners of the four or five West Region league competitions during the preceding season. The champions of the Ayrshire District League and Central District Second Division played in a preliminary round tie with the winners of that game joining the other three clubs at the semi-final stage. The &quot;Evening Times&quot; trophy was first presented in 1896–97 to the winners of the Glasgow Junior League and has been awarded to the winners of various competitions over the years. Between 2003 and 2012, the competition involved all ten league and cup winners in the West Region and was known as the &quot;Evening Times Cup Winners Cup&quot;.

Pre-2018 competitions

*Central League Cup. This was a knockout tournament for former Central Region clubs in the West Region. It was first played for in 1921–22 when known as the &quot;Glasgow Junior League Cup&quot;.
*Ayrshire Cup. This was a knockout tournament for former Ayrshire Region clubs in the West Region. The tournament originated in 1889–90 as the &quot;Ayrshire Junior Challenge Cup&quot; and was won for the first three seasons by Glenbuck Cherrypickers.
*Central Sectional League Cup. This tournament was for former Central Region clubs and was the opening competition of the season. Clubs initially competed in eight groups (sections) with the group winners advancing to a knockout competition. Based geographically, the groups comprised the same clubs each season. Matches in the group stages were played under league rules so a player was not cup-tied by turning out for a particular club.
*Ayrshire Sectional League Cup. This tournament was for former Ayrshire Region clubs. Clubs initially competed in four groups (sections) with group winners and runners up advancing to the knockout stages, otherwise the format was the same as that of the Central Sectional League Cup

===Holders===
&quot;2018–19 winners unless stated.&quot;

*West of Scotland Cup: - Beith Juniors
*Sectional League Cup: Auchinleck Talbot (2019–20)

<text>Matthias Buchinger (; June 2, 1674 – January 17, 1740), sometimes called Matthew Buckinger in English, was a German artist, magician, calligrapher, and performer who was born without hands or feet and was 2&#x27;5&quot; (74 cm.) tall. Buchinger was especially noted for his micrography, in which illustrations consist of very small text.

==Biography==
Buchinger was born in Ansbach, Germany, without hands or legs, now considered to be Phocomelia. An artist and performer, he &quot;traveled all over Northern Europe to entertain kings and aristocrats as well as hoi polloi with amazing feats of physical dexterity&quot; and was known as “The Greatest German Living” and &quot;Little Man from Nuremberg&quot;. He travelled to England trying to get a court appointment with King George I; unsuccessful, he then moved to Ireland where he gave public demonstrations, in Dublin in 1720 and in Belfast in 1722. He also is rumored to have had children by as many as 70 mistresses. Buchinger&#x27;s fame was so widespread that in the 1780s the term &quot;Buckinger&#x27;s boot&quot; existed in England as a euphemism for the vagina (because the only &quot;limb&quot; he had was his penis). Buchinger died in Cork, Ireland.

Despite his having small, finlike appendages for hands, his engravings were incredibly detailed. One such engraving, a self-portrait, was so detailed that a close examination of the curls of his hair revealed that they were in fact seven biblical psalms and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, inscribed in miniature letters.

Buchinger was also an accomplished magician, causing balls to disappear from under cups and birds to appear from nowhere. It also was said that he was unbeatable at cards and would dazzle audiences with his amazing displays of marksmanship. Buchinger made (or mended) the oldest existing model in a bottle in 1719. It is a model of miners underground and can be seen in Snowshill Manor . He had tremendous dexterity, in spite of his disability.

Buchinger&#x27;s musical skills included the ability to play a half-dozen musical instruments including the dulcimer, hautboy, trumpet, and flute and several of his own invention.

==Family ==
Buchinger was married four times and had 14 children. His first three wives (Elsche Shoomaker, Margeth Afsawein, Ann Catharin Kemchmeyer) all died shortly after giving birth and his fourth wife, Ann Elizabeth Teys outlived him. 

==Legacy ==
The Metropolitan Museum of Art presented 16 of his graphic works in a historical show entitled, “Wordplay: Matthias Buchinger’s Drawings From the Collection of Ricky Jay”. Jay, a magician and &quot;collector of antique marvels&quot;, tracked down Buchinger&#x27;s works for more than 30 years. He chronicled his pursuit of all things Buchinger in a book called &quot;Matthias Buchinger: ‘The Greatest German Living’ by Ricky Jay, Whose Peregrinations in Search of the ‘Little Man of Nuremberg’ Are Herein Revealed&quot;.

He was the son of Thomas Godwin, Bishop of Bath and Wells, born at Hannington, Northamptonshire. He was the great uncle of the writer Jonathan Swift. He was elected student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1578, took his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1580, and that of master in 1583.

After holding two Somerset livings he was in 1587 appointed subdean of Exeter. In 1590 he accompanied William Camden on an antiquarian tour through Wales. He was created bachelor of divinity in 1593, and doctor in 1595. In 1601 he published his &quot;Catalogue of the Bishops of England since the first planting of the Christian Religion in this Island&quot;, a work which procured him in the same year the diocese of Llandaff. A second edition appeared in 1615, and in 1616 he published an edition in Latin with a dedication to King James, who in the following year conferred upon him the diocese of Hereford. The work was republished, with a continuation by William Richardson, in 1743.

Godwin died, after a lingering illness, in April 1633 in Whitbourne, Herefordshire.

==Works==

In 1616 Godwin published &quot;Rerum Anglicarum, Henrico VIII., Edwardo VI. et Maria regnantibus, Annales&quot;, which was afterwards translated and published by his son Morgan under the title &quot;Annales of England&quot; (1630). He is also the author of a somewhat remarkable story, published posthumously in 1638, and entitled &quot;The Man in the Moone, or a Discourse of a Voyage thither, by Domingo Gonsales&quot;, written apparently some time in the 1620s. (On the date of composition, see John Anthony Butler&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot; [Dovehouse, 1995], pp. 14–15.) In this production Godwin not only declares himself a believer in the Copernican system, but adopts so far the principles of the law of gravitation as to suppose that weight decreases with distance from the Earth. The work, which displays considerable fancy and wit, influenced John Wilkins&#x27; &quot;The discovery of a world in the Moone&quot;. Both works were translated into French, and were imitated in several important particulars by Cyrano de Bergerac, from whom (if not from Godwin directly) Jonathan Swift obtained valuable hints in writing of Gulliver&#x27;s voyage to Laputa.

Another work of Godwin&#x27;s, &quot;Nuncius inanimatus, published In Utopia&quot;, originally printed in 1629 and again in 1657, seems to have been the prototype of John Wilkins&#x27;s &quot;Mercury, or the Secret and Swift Messenger&quot;, which appeared in 1641. Another work was &quot;De praesulibus Angliae&quot; (1616).

<text>25 meter rapid fire pistol is one of the ISSF shooting events and is shot with .22 LR pistols. The event has been a part of the Olympic program ever since the beginning in 1896, although its rules changed greatly before World War II, after which they were only slightly changed until the two major revisions of 1989 and 2005. The latter restricted the event to sport pistols, thereby banning .22 Short cartridge (last used in 2004 and replaced by .22 Long Rifle in 2005) as well as encircling grips and low trigger-pull weight. This caused a decline in results, as evidenced by a comparison of the world records under the pre-2005 rules (597) and post-2005 rules (593).

Instead of dropping specialized rapid fire pistols, manufacturers designed new pistols, such as the Walther SSP, conforming to the standard pistol requirements, but optimized for the rapid fire event.

== Course of fire ==

Traditionally, RFP competitions use paper targets that are able to turn 90 degrees to appear to the shooter and then turn back to disappear when the shooting time is up. During the last few decades, these targets have gradually been replaced by electronic devices which use red and green lights to indicate the beginning and the end of the shooting time, and which automatically handle late shots. As these systems are expensive, they are normally only used in international competitions.

A &quot;series&quot; (or &quot;string&quot;) consists of five shots fired at one target each within a limited time. The targets stand next to each other at a 25 m distance from the shooter. As with all ISSF pistol disciplines, all firing must be done with one unsupported hand. When the targets appear or when the green light comes on, the competitor must raise his arm from a 45-degree angle starting position and fire his five shots. If a shot is too late, it will score as a miss.

There are three different time limits for the series: 8 seconds, 6 seconds, and 4 seconds. A stage consists of two series of each type, and a full course of fire comprises two such stages, or a total of 60 shots. Since the targets are divided into concentric score zones with 10 being the most central part, the total maximum score is 600.

In major competitions, the top six shooters qualify for a final round of four additional 4-second series, with a shot scoring at or above 9.7 being counted as a hit, or a miss otherwise. To score 9.7 or above, the shot must be within a circle of diameter 124 mm (4.88 inches). The results of the qualification round and the final are added together, and any ties are broken by firing an additional 4-second series.

The dominant shooter of the event has been Ralf Schumann of Germany with a total of five major World-level Championship titles, with three Olympic gold medals and two Individual World titles. He is the first and one of the only two shooters to have won a particular Olympic event three times, and is the first of three shooters to have won three individual Olympic titles. Károly Takács and Józef Zapędzki also won two consecutive Olympic titles. Huelet Benner won two consecutive World Championships.

A rare double is that between this rapid fire event and its direct opposite 50 metre pistol; this has only been accomplished by Alfred Lane (completed in 1912), Torsten Ullman (1939), Huelet Benner (1952) and Pentti Linnosvuo (1964), with Lane (both events at the 1912 Olympics) and Linnosvuo using only Olympic titles. Benner, on the other hand, is the only shooter with two titles in both events.

<doc id="439002" wikidata="Q4361" url="?curid=439002" title="Curitiba">
<text>Curitiba () is the capital and largest city in the state of Paraná in Southern Brazil. The city&#x27;s population was 1,773,718 , making it the eighth most populous city in Brazil and the largest in Brazil&#x27;s South Region. The Curitiba Metropolitan area comprises 29 municipalities with a total population of over 3,559,366, making it the ninth most populous metropolitan area in the country.

The city sits on a plateau at above sea level. It is located west of the seaport of Paranaguá and is served by the Afonso Pena International and Bacacheri airports. Curitiba is an important cultural, political, and economic center in Latin America and hosts the Federal University of Paraná, established in 1912.

In the 19th century, Curitiba&#x27;s favorable location between cattle-breeding countryside and marketplaces led to a successful cattle trade and the city&#x27;s first major expansion. Later, between 1850 and 1950, it grew due to logging and agricultural expansion in Paraná State (first Araucaria angustifolia logging, later mate and coffee cultivation and in the 1970s wheat, corn and soybean cultivation). In the 1850s, waves of European immigrants arrived in Curitiba, mainly Germans, Italians, Poles and Ukrainians, contributing to the city&#x27;s economic and cultural development and richness in diversity. Nowadays, only small numbers of immigrants arrive, primarily from Middle Eastern and other South American countries.

Curitiba&#x27;s biggest expansion occurred after the 1960s, with innovative urban planning that allowed the population to grow from some hundreds of thousands to more than a million people. Curitiba&#x27;s economy is based on industry and services and is the fourth largest in Brazil. Economic growth occurred in parallel to a substantial inward flow of Brazilians from other parts of the country, as approximately half of the city&#x27;s population was not born in Curitiba.

Curitiba is one of the few Brazilian cities with a very high Human Development Index (0.856) and in 2010 it was awarded the Global Sustainable City Award, given to cities and municipalities that excel in sustainable urban development. According to US magazine &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, Curitiba is the best &quot;Brazilian Big City&quot; in which to live. Curitiba&#x27;s crime rate is considered low by Brazilian standards and the city is considered one of the safest cities in Brazil for youth. The city is also regarded as the best in which to invest in Brazil. Curitiba was one of the host cities of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, and again for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Despite its good social indicators, the city has a higher unemployment rate than other cities in the state.

==Etymology==
One theory is that the name &quot;Curitiba&quot; comes from the Tupi words &quot;kurí tyba&quot; &#x27;many araucária seeds&#x27; due to the large number of Paraná pines pinecones in the region prior to its founding.

Another version, also using words from the Tupi language, is that it originates in the combination of &quot;kurit&quot; &#x27;pine tree&#x27; and &quot;yba&quot; &#x27;large amount&#x27;.

The Portuguese, who founded a settlement on the site in 1693, named it &quot;Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais&quot; &#x27;Village of Our Lady of the Light of the Pines&#x27;.

The name was changed to &quot;Curitiba&quot; in 1721. Curitiba officially became a town in 1812, spelling its name &quot;Curityba&quot;.

An alternative spelling was &quot;Coritiba&quot;. This was used in press and state documents. A state decree in 1919 settled the dispute by adopting &quot;Curitiba&quot;.

==History==

At the end of the 17th century, Curitiba&#x27;s agriculture was only for subsistence and its main economic activities were mineral extraction. Waves of European immigrants arrived after 1850, mainly Poles, Italians, Germans (mostly Volga Germans from Russia) and Ukrainians.

Cattlemen drove their herds from Rio Grande do Sul to the state of São Paulo, turning Curitiba into an important intermediate trading post.

The Paranaguá–Curitiba railroad was opened in 1885.

Around the beginning of the 20th century, Curitiba benefited from the wealth of the yerba mate mills. The owners (known as &quot;barões da erva-mate&quot;) built mansions in the capital. These have mostly been preserved in the districts of Batel and Alto da Glória.

In the 1940s and 1950s, Alfred Agache, co-founder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce its first city plan. It emphasized a &quot;star&quot; of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. It was followed in part, but the plan was too expensive to complete.

Curitiba has a long history of being intentional about city planning. The early leaders in Curitiba were the first people to establish building regulations. This included limiting the number of trees cut and requiring homes to have tile and not wood roofs. By 1960 Curitiba’s population had increased to 430,000 and Alfred Agache&#x27;s plan for the city had not considered the future influx of immigrants. A group of young planners and architects led by Jamie Lerner from the Federal University of Paraná answered a proposal from Mayor Ivo Arzua centered around preparing Curitiba for new growth. They improved Agache’s plan by proposing adding major linear transit pathways to Curitiba to provide straightforward high-speed routes throughout the city. They also included plans for reducing downtown traffic, minimizing urban sprawl, providing easily accessible and inexpensive public transit, and preserving Curitiba’s historic district. This intelligent and well-thought-out proposal was adopted and became the Curitiba Master Plan. Jamie Lerner went on to create the city&#x27;s first urban planning department in order to facilitate further redevelopment efforts.

==Geography==
Curitiba, the capital of the Paraná state of southern Brazil, is located near the Atlantic margin of the Brazilian Highlands and the headwaters of the Iguaçu River. It is around 3,050 feet (930 meters) above sea level.

===Climate===
Curitiba features an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb)&quot;. The city&#x27;s somewhat mild winters, due to its low latitude, differentiate its climate from typically temperate ones.

Its location on a plateau and the flat terrain with flooded areas contributes to its mild and damp winters, with an average minimum temperature of in July. Temperatures can drop below on the coldest days. Daytime temperatures in winter are usually pleasant, around . However, during cold snaps, daytime temperatures might not rise above , and on rare occasions, above .

During summertime, the average temperature is around at daytime, but it can get above on the hottest days. However, temperatures above at night are rare. Snowfall was experienced in 1889, 1892, 1912, 1928 (two days), 1942, 1955, 1957, 1962, 1975, 1988, 2013 and 2020. Huge accumulation, however, is rarer.

The terrain&#x27;s flatness hinders water drainage after rain, therefore providing water vapor for the atmosphere. Cold fronts come year round, often from Antarctica and Argentina, bringing tropical storms in summer and cold winds and frost in the winter. They can move very quickly, with no more than one day between the start of the southern winds and the start of rain. Curitiba&#x27;s weather is also influenced by the dry air masses that dominate Brazil&#x27;s midwest most of the year, bringing hot and dry weather, sometimes even in winter.

===Vegetation===

Curitiba is located in the area of the Ombrophilous Mixed Forest (also known as Araucaria moist forests), a sub-type of the Atlantic Forest. In Curitiba it is possible to find steppes, forests and other formations. The local vegetation consists of remnants of the Paraná (or Brazilian) pine (&quot;Araucaria angustifolia&quot;), which resisted the efforts of settlers. The Paraná pines are in private and public areas and are protected from logging. The Municipal Secretariat of the Environment maintains a botanical garden and three greenhouses that produce 150,000 native and exotic seedlings: 16,000 fruit trees, 260,000 flowers, foliage and underbrush specimens and the maintenance of another 350,000 seedlings.

Curitiba&#x27;s green area itself matches the size of other large Brazilian cities. The vegetation of Curitiba encompasses a large population of purple and yellow &quot;ipês&quot; (tabebuias), who flower at the end of winter. The yellow ipê is one of the city&#x27;s most common tree.

===Hydrography===
The catchment area of Curitiba consists of rivers and streams that cross the city in different directions, grouped in six river basins. The main rivers that form the city&#x27;s watershed are: Atuba River, Belém River, Barigüi River, Passaúna River, Ribeirão dos Padilhas and the Iguaçu River, all with characteristics of dendritic drainage. Curitiba has been working since the 1970s on alternatives to minimize the negative impacts of on rivers. An example is the construction of parks along the rivers with artificial lakes, which absorb and retain water for longer periods of time, minimizing floods.
After many studies of local water flows, most rivers were found to be subject to a canalization process. Other alternatives developed to minimize the negative effects of urbanization are the implementation of programs for environmental education, inspection and monitoring, elaboration and application of legislation and infrastructure works.

===Topography===
The city covers on the First Plateau of Paraná. Curitiba has a topography of smooth, rounded hills, giving it a relatively regular shape. The city has an average altitude of above sea level. The highest point is to the north at , and with lower altitudes at to the south.

Mountain ranges and sets of rocky hills surround parts of the city, including the &quot;Serra do Mar&quot;, a hill range between the shore of the Atlantic Ocean and the First Plateau in Paraná.

==Government==
, the mayor is Rafael Greca, who replaced Gustavo Fruet. The City Council of Curitiba has 38 councillors elected since 2004. Curitiba is divided into nine regional governments (equivalent to subprefecture), who manage the municipality&#x27;s 75 districts. The &quot;Rua da Cidadania&quot; (&quot;Street of Citizenship&quot;) is the symbol of administrative decentralization; it is a reference point and a meeting place. Several units are annexed to public transport terminals. Their nuclei offer services in the local, state and federal areas.

Jaime Lerner is perhaps Curitiba&#x27;s best-known mayor. He was the mayor three times, the first time in the early 1970s. His leadership was crucial to some major changes in the city. Curitiba has built parks instead of canals to reduce flooding; used parks to make the city more liveable; pedestrianised the downtown area; built a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), a bus system that works similarly to a light rail system; and started a massive recycling scheme that included giving people bus tokens in return for waste.

==Demographics==
===Ethnic groups===


According to the 2022 census, 1,773,718 people resided in the city of Curitiba. The census revealed 1,320,252 White people (74.4%), 355,834 Pardo (Multiracial) people (20.1%), 71,948 Afro-Brazilian people (4.1%), 23,635 Asian people (1.3%), 1,976 Amerindian people (0.1%).

Curitiba is Brazil&#x27;s 8th most populous city. In 2010, the city had 359,201 opposite-sex couples and 974 same-sex couples. The population of Curitiba was 52.3% female and 47.7% male.

As with most of Southern Brazil&#x27;s population, Curitiba is mostly inhabited by European descendants. The first Europeans to arrive were of Portuguese origin, during the 17th century. They intermarried with the native people and with the African slaves.

Up until the 19th century, the inhabitants of the city of Curitiba were natives and mixed-race, Portuguese and Spanish immigrants. In 1808 foreigners were granted the right to ownership of land, and in 1853 Parana became an independent province, and these events resulted in a substantial number of immigrants from Europe.

The first non-Iberian (Portuguese and Spaniard) immigrants to come to the city were German.

The Memorial of Polish Immigration was inaugurated on 13 December 1980, after the visit of Pope John Paul II in June. Its area is and was part of the former Candles plant. The seven wooden log houses are parts of this memorial area, as a memento of the Polish immigrants&#x27; struggles and faith. Objects like an old wagon, pipe of cabbage and a print of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa (patron saint of the Polish people), form parts of the memorial. The first group of Poles arrived in Curitiba around 1871. Curitiba has the biggest colony of Polish immigrants in Brazil.

Italian immigrants started arriving in Brazil in 1875 and in Curitiba in 1878, coming mainly from the Veneto and Trento regions of Northern Italy. They settled mostly in the Santa Felicidade neighborhood, still a centre of the Italian community.

Nearly 20,000 Ukrainian immigrants settled there between 1895 and 1897, consisting mostly of peasants from Galicia who immigrated to Brazil to become farmers. Around 300,000 Ukrainian-Brazilians live in Paraná. The State of Paraná has the largest Ukrainian community and Slavic community.

Curitiba has a Jewish community that was originally established in the 1870s. Much of the early Jewish congregation has been assimilated. In 1937 with the rise of Nazi Germany, notable German Jewish academics migrated to Brazil, some settling in Curitiba. Physicist César Lattes and former mayors Jaime Lerner and Saul Raiz were Jewish. A Holocaust memorial is present in the city. The community centre, a Jewish school, a Chabad house (Beit Chabad), three synagogues, and two Jewish cemeteries are there, one of which was defiled in 2004.

Japanese immigrants began arriving in 1915, with a larger contingent arriving in 1924. Curitiba received a significant Japanese influx. They settled mostly between Paraná and São Paulo state. The city has the second largest Japanese community in Brazil, behind only São Paulo, according to IBGE. Although both cities have around the same proportion of Japanese descendants, other large cities in the interior of the state of Paraná, such as Maringá and Londrina, have an even higher rate. Some estimates suggest that more than 40,000 Japanese-Brazilians live in Curitiba.

===Religion===
According to the 2010 Brazilian Census, most of the population (62.36%) is Roman Catholic, other religious groups include Protestants or evangelicals (24.03%), Spiritists (2.8%), Nones 6.71%, and people with other religions (3.69).

==Economy==


Since it was declared capital of the State of Paraná in 1853, the city has gone through several major urban planning projects to avoid uncontrolled growth and thus has become an international role model in dealing with issues including transportation and the environment.

The city is Brazil&#x27;s second largest car manufacturer. Its economy is based on industry, commerce and services. For that reason, Curitiba is considered by many investors to be the best location for investment in Brazil.

The city receives more than two million tourists every year. Most arrive via the Afonso Pena International Airport, where almost 60,000 flights land annually.

According to IPEA data, the GDP in 2006 was 32 billion reals, without including agriculture and livestock (0.03%). Industry represented 34.13% and the commerce and service sectors 65.84%. Cidade Industrial de Curitiba, the industrial district, is home to many multinational industries, such as Nissan, Renault, Volkswagen, Philip Morris, Audi, Volvo, HSBC, Siemens, ExxonMobil, Electrolux and Kraft Foods, as well as many well-known national industries, such as Sadia, O Boticário and Positivo Informática.

Curitiba&#x27;s infrastructure makes bus travel fast and convenient, effectively creating demand for bus use in the same way that the infrastructure of traditional cities creates demand for private motor vehicles. In July 2001, Curitiba became Brazil&#x27;s first city to receive the prize &quot;Pole of Information Technology&quot;, granted by &quot;InfoExame&quot; magazine. According to the magazine, the companies of &quot;Technology and Information Technology&quot; based in Curitiba in 2001 achieved in revenues, representing a growth of 21% over the previous year.
The city&#x27;s 30-year economic growth rate is 7.1%, higher than the national average of 4.2%, and per capita income is 66% higher than the Brazilian average. Between 1975 and 1995, Curitiba&#x27;s domestic product grew by some 75% more than the entire State of Paraná, and 48% more than Brazil as a whole. In 1994, tourism generated - 4% of the city&#x27;s net income. Curitiba has municipal health, education and day care networks, neighborhood libraries shared by schools and citizens and Citizenship Streets, where buildings provide essential public services, sports and cultural facilities near transportation terminals. At the Open University, residents can take courses in subjects such as mechanics, hair styling and environmental protection for a small fee. Policies for job creation and income generation became part of the city&#x27;s strategic planning in the 1990s, for the metropolitan area as well as the city.
Seven large shopping malls are found in Curitiba: Mueller, Estação, Curitiba, Crystal, Palladium, Patio Batel and Park Barigüi.

Libraries work with municipal schools, offering a collection of approximately 5000 books, and provide cultural reference and leisure.

Among Brazilian capitals, Curitiba has the highest literacy rate, and ranks number 1 in education among the Brazilian capitals.

==Urban planning==

Curitiba has a planned transportation system, which includes lanes on major streets devoted to a bus rapid transit system. The buses are split into three sections (bi-articulated) and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with access for disabled riders. Buses charge one price regardless of distance.

The city preserves and cares for its green areas, boasting of green space per inhabitant.

In the 1940s and 1950s, Alfred Agache, cofounder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce the first city plan. It emphasised a star of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. The plan was too expensive to complete.

By the 1960s, Curitiba&#x27;s population had reached 430,000. Some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to damage the character of the city. In 1964, Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design. Architect Jaime Lerner, who later became mayor, led a team from the Universidade Federal do Paraná that suggested strict controls on urban sprawl, reduced traffic in the downtown area, preservation of Curitiba&#x27;s Historic Sector and a convenient and affordable public transit system.

This plan, known as the Curitiba Master Plan, was adopted in 1968. Lerner closed XV de Novembro St. to vehicles, because it had high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This used two one-way streets moving in opposite directions that surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have an exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges on the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density development, to pull traffic away from the main roads. In a number of areas subject to floods, buildings were condemned and the land became parks.

Today, Curitiba is considered one of the world&#x27;s best examples of urban planning. In June 1996, the chairman of the Habitat II summit of mayors and urban planners in Istanbul praised Curitiba as &quot;the most innovative city in the country&quot;.

Curitiba was recently recommended by UNESCO as a model for the reconstruction of the cities of Afghanistan. In the 1980s, the RIT (Rede Integrada de Transporte, &quot;Integrated Transport Network&quot;) was created. At the same time, the city began building the &quot;Faróis de Saber&quot; (&quot;Lighthouses of Knowledge&quot;) educational centres. The city has more than of public parks and forests.

In 2007, the city placed third in a list of &quot;15 Green Cities&quot; in the world, according to &quot;Grist&quot; magazine, after Reykjavík in Iceland and Portland, Oregon in the United States. As a result, according to one survey, 99% of Curitibans are happy with their hometown.

Jaime Lerner suggests urban acupuncture as the future solution for contemporary urban issues; focusing on very narrow pressure points in cities, can create positive ripple effects. Urban &quot;acupuncture&quot; reclaims land for the public and emphasizes the importance of community development through small interventions in design of cities. It emphasises pinpoint interventions that can be accomplished quickly to create an immediate impact.

The &quot;capacity building job line&quot; was created to accelerate economic development. About 15,000 new jobs were generated by 2013.

According to Jonas Rabinovitch, a United Nations senior adviser and former planner at the &quot;Curitiba Research and Urban Planning Institute&quot; (IPPUC), up to 8% of Curitiba&#x27;s population still lived in favelas as of 2016. According to 2010 census data collected by IBGE, 49,700 homes in Curitiba form part of irregular settlements. This is equivalent to 163,300 people. The population growth of favelas was 12.4% between 2000 and 2010, higher than the population in general (10.3%).

For transportation, Curitiba has over 2 million people travel by bus while the city also has the most cars per capita in Brazil.

The MuMA – Museu Metropolitano de Arte (Museum of Metropolitan Art) displays artists from the state of Paraná as well as renowned Brazilian painters such as Pancetti, Guignard and Di Cavalcanti.

The Polish Immigrants Memorial, also known as The Pope&#x27;s Woods, offers an enjoyable area surrounded by trees, which makes it a perfect choice for a stroll. The Polish Pope John Paul II blessed the first replica of the traditional Polish houses that beautifully make up the Bosque do Papa when he visited the city in 1980.

In 2003, Curitiba received the &quot;American Capital of Culture&quot; title, granted by the OAS (Organization of American States).

Curitiba&#x27;s public transportation consists entirely of buses. It opened the world&#x27;s second bus rapid transit (BRT) system, Rede Integrada de Transporte, in 1974. The popularity of Curitiba&#x27;s BRT has effected a modal shift from automobile travel to bus travel. Based on 1991 traveler survey results, it was estimated that the introduction of the BRT had caused a reduction of about 27 million auto trips per year, annually saving about 27 million liters of fuel. In particular, 28 percent of BRT riders previously traveled by car. Compared to eight other Brazilian cities of its size, Curitiba uses about 30 percent less fuel per capita, resulting in one of the country&#x27;s lowest rates of ambient air pollution. Some 1,100 buses make 12,500 trips every day, serving more than 1.3 million passengers, 50 times the number from 20 years ago. Eighty percent of travelers use the express or direct bus services. Curitibanos spend only about 10 percent of their income on transportation, far below the national average.

Curitiba has in its transport fleet the largest bi-articulated bus in the world, with 28 meters in length and capacity for 250 passengers. The bus operates only with soy-based biofuel, which reduces pollutant emissions by 50%.

The city government has been planning to introduce an underground metro for a number of years and in 2014 announced opened tenders for a 35-year public private partnership contract to build and operate a , 14-station north–south line. The cost is estimated at 4.62 billion reais.

===Roads===
