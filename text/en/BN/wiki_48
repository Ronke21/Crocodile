<text>The Malay language has a complex system of styles, titles and honorifics which are used extensively in Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Singapore.

Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, few provinces in the Philippines and several provinces in Indonesia regularly award honorary and life titles. What follows in this article is specific to the Malaysian system. References to Brunei and Indonesia are given when pertinent.

In Malaysia, all non-hereditary titles can be granted to both men and women. Every title has a form of address which can be used by the wife of the title holder. This form is not used by the husband of a titled woman; such a woman will bear a title which is the same as a titled man.
==Former usage==
Singapore, whose Malay royalty was abolished by the British colonial government in 1891, has adopted civic titles for its leaders.

Much of the Philippines was historically accustomed to the usage of Malay titles by its royals and nobles, such as Raja Sulayman and Dayang Kalangitan in Luzon. Malay titles are still prominently used by the royal houses of Sulu and Maguindanao among other noble lineages in Mindanao in preservation of genealogies. Officially, the republic does not grant royal or noble titles according to the 1987 Constitution.

Indonesia, meanwhile, as a republic, does not recognise hereditary rulers and aristocratic systems outside of Yogyakarta.

==Usage==
The sequence that should be used when formally writing or addressing a person&#x27;s name is: honorary style, professional rank, royal hereditary title, federal title, state title, non-royal hereditary title, Doctor (of medicine or philosophy), Haji/Hajah (for Muslim men and women who have performed the Hajj), name.

For instance, in Brunei, the Wazir is a group of royal nobles, namely one of the royal princes who is &quot;gahara&quot; (pure descendants of the Sultan), are the second-highest official post in the nation, right behind the Sultan. Following this, the Cheteria, only bestowed upon the Pengiran, who perform specific jobs and are ranked above the Manteri, a group of non-royal nobles. An example of a Manteri would be the former police commissioner of Brunei, Hasrin Sabtu, whose honorary title would be &quot;Yang Dimuliakan&quot; (The Exalted One), noble rank is &quot;Pehin Orang Kaya Pendikar Alam&quot;, state title is &quot;Dato Paduka Seri&quot; and traditional Bruneian prefix title for non-royalty is &quot;Awang&quot; (Mr.).

When in the home state, the state title may precede the federal title. An example is the current Premier of Sarawak, Abang Abdul Rahman Zohari Abang Openg, whose federal title is &quot;Tan Sri&quot; and whose state title is &quot;Datuk Patinggi&quot;. His title will be expressed as either:
*&quot;Yang Amat Berhormat Tan Sri Datuk Patinggi&quot; (Dr.) Abang Haji Abdul Rahman Zohari bin Tun Datuk Abang Haji Openg (federally)
*&quot;Yang Amat Berhormat Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri&quot; (Dr.) Abang Haji Abdul Rahman Zohari bin Tun Datuk Abang Haji Openg (in his home state).

Another exception is when a person has received an award from a state other than the person&#x27;s home state; when visiting the award-bestowing state, that state&#x27;s title will take the place of a home state&#x27;s title (if any). As an example, the current Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim will be titled as follows:
*&quot;Yang Amat Berhormat Dato&#x27; Seri&quot; Anwar bin Ibrahim (federally)
*&quot;Yang Amat Berhormat Datuk Seri Panglima&quot; Anwar bin Ibrahim (in Sabah)
*&quot;Yang Amat Berhormat Dato&#x27; Seri Utama&quot; Anwar bin Ibrahim (in Penang)
*&quot;Yang Amat Berhormat Dato&#x27; Seri Diraja&quot; Anwar bin Ibrahim (in Perlis)

A style carried by virtue of royal title always trumps those carried by non-royal titles. Male royals may choose to append &#x27;al-Haj&#x27; to their name instead of using &#x27;Haji&#x27;. The following example is correct:
*&quot;Yang Amat Mulia&quot; General Tengku Dato&#x27; (name) al-Haj.

==Malay royalty==
The following titles are hereditary and reserved for the royal families of Brunei and nine royal states of Malaysia.

===Brunei===

==Federal titles==
In Malaysia, the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot; (King of Malaysia) grants honours to recipients nominated by the Government of Malaysia as awards which are honorary and non-hereditary. These honours may also be revoked by the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot; or returned by the individual. Some of the highest honours bestowed carries with them the titles of &quot;Tun&quot;, &quot;Tan Sri&quot;, or &quot;Datuk&quot;.

There is a maximum number of Malaysian subjects who may be award-holders at any one time. These numerical limits apply only to Malaysian subjects. Foreigners may be awarded such titles in a supernumerary and honorary capacity, and may use the title locally.

===Tun===
The &quot;Tun&quot; title has existed in Malay traditional society for hundreds of years. In ancient times, &quot;Tun&quot; was an honorific title used by noble people of royal lineage, inherited by the male descendants. Over time, the &quot;Tun&quot; title has become a title conferred by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to the most-deserving recipient who has highly contributed to the nation.

&quot;Tun&quot; is the most senior federal title awarded to recipients of either the &quot;Seri Maharaja Mangku Negara&quot; (Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm) (SMN) or &quot;Seri Setia Mahkota&quot; (Grand Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia) (SSM). However, the SMN and SSM are not the highest federal awards, ranking fourth and fifth, respectively. There may not be more than 25 (SMN) and 35 (SSM) living holders of each of these awards respectively at any one time. The title for the wife of a &quot;Tun&quot; is called &quot;Toh Puan&quot;. The recipients and their wives are then bestowed with the style of &quot;Yang Amat Berbahagia&quot; or (The Most Felicitous).

The SMN is usually awarded to newly appointed (YDPN), and to all the retired Prime Ministers of Malaysia, with the exception of Tunku Abdul Rahman (he is the Prince of the state of Kedah), Najib Razak, Muhyiddin Yassin, and Ismail Sabri Yaakob.

Examples:
*&quot;Yang Amat Berbahagia&quot; (The Most Felicitous) &quot;Tun&quot; Dr. Mahathir Mohamad ;
*&quot;Yang Amat Berbahagia&quot; (The Most Felicitous) &quot;Tun&quot; Dr. Ling Liong Sik .

===Tan Sri===
&quot;Tan Sri&quot; is the second-most senior federal title and a honorific, used to denote recipients of the &quot;Panglima Mangku Negara&quot; (Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm) (PMN) and the &quot;Panglima Setia Mahkota&quot; (Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia) (PSM). The wife of a &quot;Tan Sri&quot; is called &quot;Puan Sri&quot;. The recipients and their wives are then bestowed with the style of &quot;Yang Berbahagia&quot; or (The Felicitous).

Examples:
* &quot;Tan Sri Datuk Amar&quot; P. Ramlee
*&quot;Yang Berhormat Tan Sri Dato&#x27; Haji&quot; Muhyiddin Yassin ;
*&quot;Yang Berbahagia Tan Sri Datuk Seri Panglima&quot; Abdul Gani Patail ;
*&quot;Yang Berbahagia Tan Sri&quot; Dr Runme Shaw, ;
*&quot;Yang Berbahagia Tan Sri Dato&#x27; Seri&quot; Michelle Yeoh ;
*&quot;Yang Berbahagia Tan Sri Dato Sri&quot; Dr Muhammad Shafee Abdullah .

===Datuk===

&quot;Datuk&quot; is a federal title that has been conferred since 1965. It is limited to recipients of &quot;Panglima Jasa Negara&quot; (Commander of the Order of Meritorious Service) (PJN) and &quot;Panglima Setia Diraja&quot; (Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Royal Family of Malaysia) (PSD). There may be up to 200 living PJN holders and 200 living PSD holders at any one time. The title of the wife of a male Datuk is &quot;Datin&quot;; women with the title can take either the title &quot;Datin&quot; or &quot;Datuk&quot;. The recipients and their wives are then bestowed with the style of &quot;Yang Berbahagia&quot; (The Felicitous).

Examples:
*&quot;Yang Berbahagia Datuk&quot; Lee Chong Wei ;
*&quot;Yang Berbahagia Datuk&quot; Punch Gunalan ;
*&quot;Yang Berbahagia Datuk&quot; Ahmad Fauzi Hasan;
*&quot;Yang Berbahagia Datuk&quot; Prof. Dr. Mohamad Akram Laldin.
=== Dato ===
In Brunei, the title &quot;Dato&quot; is now comparable to the Commonwealth&#x27;s Sir and is frequently used with a great non-royal chief.

==State titles==
In Malaysia, state honours are awarded by the respective heads of the thirteen states. Such titles are honorary and non-hereditary. State titles may be revoked or suspended by the head of state, or may be returned by the individual. Dato&#x27; Sri or Dato&#x27; Seri (sometimes Dato’ is spelled and pronounced Datuk in some states) is the highest state title conferred by the Ruler on the most deserving recipients who have contributed greatly to the nation or state. It ranks below the federal title Tun, and is an honour equivalent to federal title Tan Sri. The wife of a recipient is Datin Sri or Datin Seri. In many cases, the number of Malaysian nationals who may hold a state title or honour at one time is limited. Such limits do not apply to foreigners.

===Pehin===
This title is mainly used in Brunei Darussalam. An example of the title in Brunei would be &quot;Pehin Orang Kaya Laila Setia Bakti Di-Raja Dato Laila Utama&quot; Haji Awang Isa, the former Minister of Home Affairs and the current Special Adviser to the Sultan of Brunei. The titles refers to the traditional ministers posts in Brunei.

===Pehin Sri===
This title is mainly used in Sarawak. Awarded to individuals who have been appointed as Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak or equivalent or higher. An example of the title in Sarawak would be Tun Pehin Sri Haji Abdul Taib Mahmud, Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak.

===Seri Setia===
This title is mainly used in Malacca. Awarded to individuals who have been appointed as Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Malacca or equivalent or higher. An example of the title in Malacca would be Tun Seri Setia (Dr.) Haji Mohd Ali Rustam, Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Malacca.

===JP===
Justice of Peace (JP) ranks below all &quot;Dato″&quot; or &quot;Datuk&quot;. In Malaysia, Justices of Peace have largely been replaced in magistrates&#x27; courts by legally-qualified (first-class) stipendiary magistrates. However, state governments continue to appoint Justices of Peace as honours. In 2004, some associations of JPs pressed the federal government to allow JPs to sit as second-class magistrates to reduce the backlog of cases in the courts.

==Special cases==
If a person has been awarded several honours from different states, the title used varies. For example, sometimes former Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad is usually referred to as &quot;YABhg Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad&quot; anywhere in Malaysia. However, different terms of address &quot;may&quot; be used in the states that he visits. In Sarawak, he will be referred to as &quot;YABhg Tun Pehin Sri Mahathir Mohamad&quot; as he received the Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of Sarawak (SBS) from the Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak. While in Sabah, he is referred to as &quot;Tun Datuk Seri Panglima Dr. Mahathir Mohamad&quot;, as he received the Grand Commander of the Order of Kinabalu (SPDK) from the Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sabah.

==Honorary styles==
The following are used as styles, both before a person&#x27;s title, and by themselves as forms of address:
*&quot;Tuan Yang Terutama&quot; (TYT) () – the style of a state governor, equivalent to &#x27;Your/His Excellency&#x27;, and also as a title for serving Ambassadors to Malaysia, e.g. T.Y.T. Tuan Brian D. McFeeters. Previously, the archaic equivalent to the style &quot;His Excellency&quot; was &quot;Paduka Yang Mulia&quot; (PYM). This was used by Singapore, Indonesia, and in Malaysia; for other Republic&#x27;s leaders, while the style for Governors / Yang di-Pertuas were &quot;Yang Terutama&quot;.
*&quot;Yang Amat Berhormat&quot; (YAB) () – the style of the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the Premier of Sarawak, the chief ministers and the Menteri Besars of the states, and Tuns who are members of parliament. It used to be &#x27;the Right Honorable&#x27;, but since Malaysia withdrew as a member of the Privy Council in the 1990s, the right to use &#x27;Right Honorable&#x27; has been revoked.
*&quot;Yang Berhormat&quot; (YB) () – the style of members of parliament and state legislative assemblymen. The prefix &quot;Yang Berhormat&quot; is also used for recipients of the First and Second Classes of the Johor&#x27;s Orders of Chivalry, regardless of whether a member of parliament or not.
*&quot;Yang Berhormat Mulia&quot; (YBM) () - the style for a member of royalty who is also a member of parliament (e.g. Yang Berhormat Mulia Tengku Zulpuri Shah Raja Puji, the MP for Raub). This style is also used by royals with high ranking federal titles such as Tun or Tan Sri (eg. Yang Berhormat Mulia Tun Raja Uda).
*&quot;Yang Amat Arif&quot; (YAA) () – the style of the Chief Justice of Malaysia, the President of the Court of Appeal of Malaysia, the Chief Judge of the High Court of Malaya, and the Chief Judge of the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak.
*&quot;Yang Arif&quot; (YA) () – the style of a judge of the Federal Court or Court of Appeal, as well a judicial commissioner or judge of the High Court of Malaya or the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak. It does not apply to session court judges or magistrates.
*&quot;Yang Amat Berbahagia&quot; (YABhg) () – the style of persons with the titles &quot;Tun&quot; or &quot;Toh Puan&quot;, and the spouses of state governors, the spouse of the prime minister, the spouse of the deputy prime minister, as well as the spouses of state chief ministers.
*&quot;Yang Berbahagia&quot; (YBhg) () (and variants thereof) – the styles of persons with a chivalrous title.
*&quot;Yang Hormat&quot; (YH) () – the style for recipients of the First and Second Classes of the Pahang&#x27;s Orders of Chivalry.

The English versions of these styles follow British usage. Thus the prime minister, cabinet ministers, senators, state executive councillors and judges of the High Court and above are styled the Honorable or the Right Honorable, although technically it is a solecism to style the prime minister or heads of courts Right Honourable as they are not members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

This title is the highest and is only given to the children who descended from the Bugis Royal family, that is if the father is the descendent from Bugis Royalty. If the mother is a descendent from the Bugis Royal Family but the father is not, meaning he has no Bugis Royal Family title, the Father is a commoner who cannot use the title Andi, Daeng, Tok, Pengiran, Tengku, Raja for his children.

*Awang, is the term used for addressing men in Brunei equivalent to Mr. or as a given hereditary name amongst Sarawakian Malay. Anyone who inherited the name of &quot;Awangku&quot; through patrilineal family lineage may later claim the title Pengiran since they are also related to the Brunei Sultanate. This, however, requires the approval of elders who must consider if he is mature enough to carry the title – or once he has married. As for the rule of inheritance of the name, it is the same as Abang.

This is typically found in Patani, Pahang, Kelantan, Kedah, Terengganu, and Natuna-Anambas.

A female issue of &quot;Wan&quot; carries the title Sharifah. A &quot;Wan&quot; may later claim the title &quot;Tuanku&quot;. This, however, can only be done after he gains the approval of the elders and is considered mature enough to carry the title. The change is only eligible for those who inherit the name &quot;Wan&quot; from their family line. The issue of a Sharifah does not carry a title if he/she has a non-Wan father.

<doc id="435492" wikidata="Q14125" url="?curid=435492" title="Bow tie">
<text>The bow tie or dicky bow is a type of necktie. A modern bow tie is tied using a common shoelace knot, which is also called the bow knot for that reason. It consists of a ribbon of fabric tied around the collar of a shirt in a symmetrical manner so that the two opposite ends form loops.

There are generally three types of bow ties: the pre-tied, the clip-on, and the self-tie. Pre-tied bow ties are ties in which the distinctive bow is sewn onto a band that goes around the neck and clips to secure. Some &quot;clip-ons&quot; dispense with the band altogether, instead clipping straight to the collar. The traditional bow tie, consisting of a strip of cloth that the wearer has to tie by hand, is also known as a &quot;self-tie&quot;, &quot;tie-it-yourself&quot;, or &quot;freestyle&quot; bow tie.

Bow ties may be made of any fabric material, but most are made from silk, polyester, cotton, or a mixture of fabrics. Some fabrics (e.g., wool or velvet) are much less common for bow ties than for ordinary four-in-hand neckties.

==Origin and history==
The bow tie originated among Croatian mercenaries during the Thirty Years&#x27; War of the 17th century: the Croat mercenaries used a scarf around the neck to hold together the opening of their shirts. This was soon adopted (under the name &quot;cravat&quot;, derived from the French for &quot;Croat&quot;) by the upper classes in France, then a leader in fashion, and flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. It is uncertain whether the cravat then evolved into the bow tie and four-in-hand necktie, or whether the cravat gave rise to the bow tie, which in turn led to the four-in-hand necktie.

The most traditional bow ties are usually of a fixed length and are made for a specific size neck. Sizes can vary between approximately and as with a comparable shirt collar. Fixed-length bow ties are preferred when worn with the most formal wing-collar shirts, so as not to expose the buckle or clasp of an adjustable bow tie. Adjustable bow ties are the standard when the tie is to be worn with a less formal, lie-down collar shirt that obscures the neckband of the tie. &quot;One-size-fits-all&quot; adjustable bow ties are a later invention that helps to moderate production costs.
The lavallière is a type of cravat similar to the bow tie that was popularly worn in the 19th century in France. It is of a similar fashion to the bow tie but has a larger knot and drooping ends.

==Wearers==


Popular perception tends to associate bow tie wearers with particular professions, such as architects, debt collectors, attorneys, university professors, teachers, waiters, and politicians. Pediatricians frequently wear bow ties, for infants cannot grab them the way they could grab a four-in-hand necktie. Bow ties do not readily droop into places where they would get soiled or where they could, whether accidentally or deliberately, strangle the wearer. Clowns sometimes use an oversized bow tie for comic effect. Classical musicians traditionally perform in white tie or black tie ensembles, of which both designs are bow ties. Bow ties are also associated with weddings, mainly because of their almost universal inclusion in traditional formal evening-wear.

Bow ties, or slight variations thereof, have also made their way into women&#x27;s wear, especially business attire. The 1980s saw professional women, especially in law, banking, and the corporate world, donning very conservative tailored suits, with a rise of almost 6 million units in sales. These were often worn with buttoned-up blouses, some with pleats up the front like tuxedo shirts, and accessorized with bow ties that were slightly fuller than the standard bow ties worn by their male counterparts, but typically consisting of the same fabrics, colors, and patterns as men&#x27;s ties.

Russell Smith, style columnist for Toronto&#x27;s &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, records mixed opinions of bow tie wearers. He observed that bow ties were experiencing a potential comeback among men, though &quot;the class conscious man recoils at the idea&quot; of pre-tied bow ties and &quot;[l]eft-wingers ... recoil at what they perceive to be a symbol of political conservatism.&quot; He argues that anachronism is the point, and that bow tie wearers are making a public statement of their disdain for changing fashion. Such people may not be economic conservatives, he argues, but they &quot;are&quot; social conservatives. In Smith&#x27;s view, the bow tie is &quot;the embodiment of propriety&quot;, an indicator of fastidiousness, and &quot;an instant sign of nerddom in Hollywood movies&quot;, but &quot;not the mark of a ladies&#x27; man&quot; and &quot;not exactly sexy&quot;. He attributes the building of this image to the association of the bow tie with newspaper editors (because of their fastidiousness with words), high-school principals, and bachelor English teachers. Most men, he observes, only wear bow ties with formal dress.

==Types==
===Self-tie===
There are usually two shapes of self-the bow ties available: the &quot;bat wing&quot;, which is parallel-sided like a cricket bat, and the &quot;thistle&quot;, also known as the &quot;butterfly&quot;. An example of each can also be seen below. Which is worn is a matter of personal preference. Some other shapes do exist; for instance, the Diamond Point, with pointed tips at both ends. This is a double-ended type, with both ends shaped, though occasionally, ties are tied in the single-ended type, in which only one end flares out to give the batwing or thistle shape, and the other remains thin. To tie one of these requires careful consideration, to ensure the broader end finishes in front of the thinner one.

===Pre-tie===
Shown below on the right is one style of pre-tie/ready-tie bow tie. Wearing a ready-tied bow tie at formal occasions requiring a black or white tie dress code is usually considered a faux pas, though at occasions such as Schools Leavers&#x27; Proms or ones at which the participants are unlikely to have had much experience wearing bow ties, it may be commonplace.

As shown in the pictures below, another type of ready-tie bow tie is the wooden bow tie, a fairly new product made mostly in the U.S and Canada. Other materials are also in use. An example would be bow ties that are made of natural bird feathers; this too is a fairly new product made mostly in the U.S. and Europe (in Poland).

===Clip-on===

A clip-on does not go around the neck but clips to the collar points.

<doc id="435497" wikidata="Q242352" url="?curid=435497" title="Yugoslav Wars">
<text>The Yugoslav Wars were a series of separate but related ethnic conflicts, wars of independence, and insurgencies that took place from 1991 to 2001 in what had been the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFR Yugoslavia). The conflicts both led up to and resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, which began in mid-1991, into six independent countries matching the six entities known as republics that had previously constituted Yugoslavia: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, and Macedonia (now called North Macedonia). SFR Yugoslavia&#x27;s constituent republics declared independence due to unresolved tensions between ethnic minorities in the new countries, which fueled the wars. While most of the conflicts ended through peace accords that involved full international recognition of new states, they resulted in a massive number of deaths as well as severe economic damage to the region.

During the initial stages of the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) sought to preserve the unity of the Yugoslav nation by eradicating all republic governments. However, it increasingly came under the influence of Slobodan Milošević, whose government invoked Serbian nationalism as an ideological replacement for the weakening communist system. As a result, the JNA began to lose Slovenes, Croats, Kosovar Albanians, Bosniaks, and Macedonians, and effectively became a fighting force of only Serbs and Montenegrins. According to a 1994 report by the United Nations (UN), the Serb side did not aim to restore Yugoslavia; instead, it aimed to create a &quot;Greater Serbia&quot; from parts of Croatia and Bosnia. Other irredentist movements have also been brought into connection with the Yugoslav Wars, such as &quot;Greater Albania&quot; (from Kosovo, idea abandoned following international diplomacy) and &quot;Greater Croatia&quot; (from parts of Herzegovina, abandoned in 1994 with the Washington Agreement).

Often described as one of Europe&#x27;s deadliest armed conflicts since World War II, the Yugoslav Wars were marked by many war crimes, including genocide, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, massacres, and mass wartime rape. The Bosnian genocide was the first European wartime event to be formally classified as genocidal in character since the military campaigns of Nazi Germany, and many of the key individuals who perpetrated it were subsequently charged with war crimes; the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established by the UN in The Hague, Netherlands, to prosecute all individuals who had committed war crimes during the conflicts. According to the International Center for Transitional Justice, the Yugoslav Wars resulted in the deaths of 140,000 people, while the Humanitarian Law Center estimates at least 130,000 casualties. Over their decade-long duration, the conflicts resulted in major refugee and humanitarian crises.

In 2006 the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) was expanded to include many of the previous Yugoslav republics, in order to show that despite the political conflicts economic cooperation was still possible. CEFTA went into full effect by the end of 2007.

== Naming ==
The Yugoslav Wars have alternatively been referred to as:
*&quot;Wars in the Balkans&quot;
*&quot;Wars/conflicts in the former Yugoslavia&quot;
*&quot;Wars of Yugoslav Secession/Succession&quot;
*&quot;Third Balkan War&quot;: a term which is contained in the title of a book by the British journalist Misha Glenny, the term alludes to the two previous Balkan Wars which were waged from 1912 to 1913. However, some contemporary historians have previously applied this term to World War I, because they believe it to be a direct sequel to the 1912–13 wars.
*&quot;Yugoslav/Yugoslavia/Yugoslavian Civil War&quot;, &quot;Civil War in Yugoslavia&quot;

==Background==
The state of Yugoslavia was created in the aftermath of World War I, and its population was mostly composed of South Slavic Christians, though the nation also had a substantial Muslim minority. Clear ethnic conflict between the Yugoslav peoples only became prominent in the 20th century, beginning with tensions over the constitution of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in the early 1920s and escalating into violence between Serbs and Croats in the late 1920s after the assassination of Croatian politician Stjepan Radić. This nation lasted from 1918 to 1941, when it was invaded by the Axis powers during World War II, which provided support to the Croatian fascist Ustaše (founded in 1929), whose regime carried out the genocide of Serbs, Jews and Roma by executing people in concentration camps and committing other systematic and mass crimes inside its territory.

The predominantly Serb Chetniks, a Yugoslav Royalist and Serbian nationalist movement and guerrilla force, committed mass crimes against Muslims and Croats that are considered a genocide by several authors, and they also supported the instatement of a Serbian monarchy and the establishment of a Yugoslav federation. The Communist-led Yugoslav Partisans were able to appeal to all groups, including Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks, and also engaged in mass killings. In 1945, the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia (FPRY) was established under Josip Broz Tito, who maintained a strongly authoritarian leadership that suppressed nationalism.

After Tito&#x27;s death in 1980, relations between the six republics of the federation deteriorated. Slovenia, Croatia and Kosovo desired greater autonomy within the Yugoslav confederation, while Serbia sought to strengthen federal authority. As it became clear that there was no solution that was agreeable to all parties, Slovenia and Croatia moved towards independence. Although tensions in Yugoslavia had been mounting since the early 1980s, events in 1990 proved to be decisive. In the midst of economic hardship and the fall of communism in eastern Europe in 1989, Yugoslavia was facing rising nationalism among its various ethnic groups. By the early 1990s, there was no effective authority at the federal level. The Federal Presidency consisted of the representatives of the six republics, two provinces and the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, and the communist leadership was divided along national lines.

The representatives of Vojvodina, Kosovo and Montenegro were replaced with loyalists of the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević. Serbia secured four out of eight federal presidency votes and was able to heavily influence decision-making at the federal level, since all the other Yugoslav republics only had one vote. While Slovenia and Croatia wanted to allow a multi-party system, Serbia, led by Milošević, demanded an even more centralized federation and Serbia&#x27;s dominant role in it.

At the 14th Extraordinary Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in January 1990, the Serbian-dominated assembly agreed to abolish the single-party system. However, Slobodan Milošević, the head of the Serbian Party branch (League of Communists of Serbia) used his influence to block and vote down all other proposals from the Croatian and Slovene party delegates. This prompted the Croatian and Slovene delegations to walk out and thus the break-up of the party, a symbolic event representing the end of &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot;.

The survey of Yugoslav citizens that was conducted in 1990 showed that ethnic animosity existed on a small scale. Compared to the results from 25 years before, there was a significant increase in ethnic distance among Serbs and Montenegrins toward Croats and Slovenes and vice versa.

Upon Croatia and Slovenia&#x27;s declarations of independence in 1991, the Yugoslav federal government attempted to forcibly halt the impending breakup of the country, with Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Marković declaring that the secessions of Slovenia and Croatia were both illegal and contrary to the constitution of Yugoslavia, and he also expressed his support for the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army in order to secure the integral unity of Yugoslavia. The Slovenes (represented by Milan Kučan and Lojze Peterle) and Croats argued that the act was not secession but disassociation (, ) from Yugoslavia as the federation was originally established as a voluntary union of peoples. The Badinter Commission ruled in November 1991 that the act was not secession but a separation as provided for by the constitution of the second Yugoslavia.

According to Stephen A. Hart, author of &quot;Partisans: War in the Balkans 1941–1945&quot;, the ethnically mixed region of Dalmatia held close and amicable relations between the Croats and Serbs who lived there in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many early proponents of a united Yugoslavia came from this region, such as Ante Trumbić, a Croat from Dalmatia. However, by the time of the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars, any hospitable relations between Croats and Serbs in Dalmatia had broken down, with Dalmatian Serbs fighting on the side of the self-declared proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina.

Even though the policies throughout the entire socialist period of Yugoslavia seemed to have been the same (namely that all Serbs should live in one state), political scientist Dejan Guzina argues that &quot;different contexts in each of the subperiods of socialist Serbia and Yugoslavia yielded entirely different results (e.g., in favour of Yugoslavia, or in favour of a Greater Serbia)&quot;. He assumes that the Serbian policy changed from conservative–socialist at the beginning to xenophobic nationalist in the late 1980s and 1990s.

The rise of nationalism also saw rise of &quot;ethnoclericalism&quot;, with the Serbian Orthodox Church involved in the politics and support of Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s regime&#x27;s attack in Kosovo, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well Catholic Church in Croatia and Islamic Community of Yugoslavia involvement for respective political causes of Croats and Bosniaks.

In Serbia and Serb-dominated territories, violent confrontations occurred, particularly between nationalists and non-nationalists who criticized the Serbian government and the Serb political entities in Bosnia and Croatia. Serbs who publicly opposed the nationalist political climate during the Yugoslav wars were reportedly harassed, threatened, or killed. However, following Milošević&#x27;s rise to power and the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars, numerous anti-war movements developed in Serbia. Protests were held against the actions of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, while protesters demanded the referendum on a declaration of war and disruption of military conscription, resulting in numerous desertions and emigrations.

With the escalation of the Yugoslav crisis, the JNA became
heavily dominated by Serbs. According to the former commander of the fifth army in Zagreb Martin Špegelj, 50% of the command positions were previously held by Croats, while a few years later at the beginning of the war all key positions were held by Serbs.

== History ==

=== Conflicts ===
==== Slovenian War of Independence (1991) ====

The first of the conflicts, known as the Ten-Day War, was initiated by the JNA (Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army) on 26 June 1991 after the separation of Slovenia from the federation on 25 June 1991.

Initially, the federal government ordered the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army to secure border crossings in Slovenia. Slovenian police and Slovenian Territorial Defence blockaded barracks and roads, leading to stand-offs and limited skirmishes around the republic. After several dozen casualties, the limited conflict was stopped through negotiation at Brioni on 7 July 1991, when Slovenia and Croatia agreed to a three-month moratorium on separation. The Federal Army completely withdrew from Slovenia by 26 October 1991.
==== Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995) ====

Fighting in Croatia had begun weeks prior to the Ten-Day War in Slovenia. The Croatian War of Independence began when Serbs in Croatia, who were opposed to Croatian independence, announced their secession from Croatia.

In the 1990 parliamentary elections in Croatia, Franjo Tuđman became the first President of Croatia. He promoted nationalist policies and had a primary goal of the establishment of an independent Croatia. The new government proposed constitutional changes, reinstated the traditional Croatian flag and coat of arms, and removed the term &quot;Socialist&quot; from the title of the republic. The new Croatian government implemented policies that were openly nationalistic and anti-Serbian in nature, such as the removal of the Serbian Cyrillic script from correspondence in public offices. In an attempt to counter changes made to the constitution, local Serb politicians organized a referendum on &quot;sovereignty and autonomy of Serbian people in Croatia&quot; on 17 August 1990. Their boycott escalated into an insurrection in areas populated by ethnic Serbs, mostly around Knin, known as the Log Revolution.

Local police in Knin sided with the growing Serbian insurgency, while many government employees, mostly police where commanding positions were mainly held by Serbs, lost their jobs. The new Croatian constitution was ratified in December 1990, and the Serb National Council formed SAO Krajina, a self-proclaimed Serbian autonomous region.

Ethnic tensions rose, fueled by propaganda in both Croatia and Serbia. On 2 May 1991, one of the first armed clashes between Serb paramilitaries and Croatian police occurred in the Battle of Borovo Selo. On 19 May an independence referendum was held, which was largely boycotted by Croatian Serbs, and the majority voted in favour of the independence of Croatia. Croatia declared independence and dissolved its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. Due to the Brioni Agreement, a three-month moratorium was placed on the implementation of the decision that ended on 8 October.

The armed incidents of early 1991 escalated into an all-out war during the summer, with fronts being formed around the areas of the breakaway SAO Krajina. The JNA had disarmed the Territorial Units of Slovenia and Croatia prior to the declaration of independence, at the behest of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. This was greatly aggravated by an arms embargo, imposed by the UN on Yugoslavia. The JNA was ostensibly ideologically unitarian, but its officer corps was predominantly staffed by Serbs or Montenegrins (70 percent).

As a result, the JNA opposed Croatian independence and sided with the Croatian Serb rebels. The Croatian Serb rebels were unaffected by the embargo because they were supported and supplied by the JNA. By mid-July 1991, the JNA moved an estimated 70,000 troops to Croatia. The fighting rapidly escalated, eventually spanning hundreds of square kilometers from western Slavonia through Banija to Dalmatia.

Border regions faced direct attacks from forces within Serbia and Montenegro. In August 1991, the Battle of Vukovar began, where fierce fighting took place with around 1,800 Croat fighters blocking the JNA&#x27;s advance into Slavonia. By the end of October, the town was almost completely devastated as a result of land shelling and air bombardment. The Siege of Dubrovnik started in October with the shelling of UNESCO World Heritage Site Dubrovnik, where the international press was criticised for focusing on the city&#x27;s architectural heritage, instead of reporting the destruction of Vukovar in which many civilians were killed.

On 18 November 1991, the battle of Vukovar ended after the city ran out of ammunition. The Ovčara massacre occurred shortly after Vukovar&#x27;s capture by the JNA. Meanwhile, control over central Croatia was seized by Croatian Serb forces in conjunction with the JNA Corps from Bosnia and Herzegovina, under the leadership of Ratko Mladić.

In January 1992, the Vance Plan established UN controlled (UNPA) zones for Serbs in the territory which was claimed by the Serbian rebels as the self-proclaimed proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and brought an end to major military operations, but sporadic artillery attacks on Croatian cities and occasional intrusions into UNPA zones by Croatian forces continued until 1995. The majority of Croatian population in RSK suffered heavily, fleeing or evicted with numerous killings, leading to ethnic cleansing.

The fighting in Croatia ended in mid-1995, after Operation Flash and Operation Storm. At the end of these operations, Croatia had reclaimed all of its territory except the UNPA Sector East portion of Slavonia, bordering Serbia.

During and after theses offensives, around 150,000–200,000 Serbs of the area formerly held by the ARSK were ethnically cleansed and a variety of crimes were committed against some of the remaining civilians by Croatian forces. The Croatian Serbs became the largest refugee population in Europe prior to the 2022 Ukraine war.

The areas of &quot;Sector East&quot;, unaffected by the Croatian military operations, came under UN administration (UNTAES), and were reintegrated to Croatia in 1998 under the terms of the Erdut Agreement.

====Bosnian War (1992–1995)====

On 2 April 1992, a conflict engulfed Bosnia and Herzegovina as it also declared independence from rump Yugoslavia. The war was predominantly a territorial conflict between the Bosniaks, who wanted to preserve the territorial integrity of the newly independent Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb proto-state Republika Srpska and the self-proclaimed Croat Herzeg-Bosnia, which were led and supplied by Serbia and Croatia respectively, reportedly with a goal of the partition of Bosnia, which would leave only a small part of land for the Bosniaks. On 18 December 1992, the United Nations General Assembly issued resolution 47/121 in which it condemned Serbian and Montenegrin forces for trying to acquire more territories by force.

The Yugoslav armed forces had disintegrated into a largely Serb-dominated military force. The JNA opposed the Bosnian-majority led government&#x27;s agenda for independence, and along with other armed nationalist Serb militant forces attempted to prevent Bosnian citizens from voting in the 1992 referendum on independence. They failed to persuade people not to vote, and instead the intimidating atmosphere combined with a Serb boycott of the vote resulted in a resounding 99% vote in support for independence.

On 19 June 1992, the war in Bosnia broke out, though the Siege of Sarajevo had already begun in April after Bosnia and Herzegovina had declared independence. The conflict, typified by the years-long Sarajevo siege and the Srebrenica genocide, was by far the bloodiest and most widely covered of the Yugoslav wars. The Bosnian Serb faction led by ultra-nationalist Radovan Karadžić promised independence for all Serb areas of Bosnia from the majority-Bosniak government of Bosnia. To link the disjointed parts of territories populated by Serbs and areas claimed by Serbs, Karadžić pursued an agenda of systematic ethnic cleansing primarily against Bosnians through massacre and forced removal of Bosniak populations. Prijedor ethnic cleansing, Višegrad massacres, Foča ethnic cleansing, Doboj massacre, Zvornik massacre, siege of Goražde and others were reported.

At the end of 1992, tensions between Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks rose and their collaboration fell apart. In January 1993, the two former allies engaged in open conflict, resulting in the Croat–Bosniak War. In 1994 the US brokered peace between Croatian forces and the Bosnian Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Washington Agreement. After the successful Flash and Storm operations, the Croatian Army and the combined Bosnian and Croat forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina conducted an operation codenamed Operation Mistral in September 1995 to push back Bosnian Serb military gains.

The advances on the ground along with NATO air strikes put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to come to the negotiating table. Pressure was put on all sides to stick to the cease-fire and negotiate an end to the war in Bosnia. The war ended with the signing of the Dayton Agreement on 14 December 1995, with the formation of Republika Srpska as an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina. Along with ending the war, the Dayton Agreement also established the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The constitution is consociational in nature and describes Bosniacs, Croats and Serbs as &quot;constituent peoples,&quot; giving each ethnic group far reaching veto powers in government. In 2000, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina required the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska to recognize all &quot;constituent peoples&quot; as entitled to full equality throughout the nation. Similarly, Article X of the constitution declares that the rights and freedoms defined in Article II may not be altered. Features like these are common throughout the constitution in order to assuage feelings of mistrust between the different ethnic groups and maintain lasting stability.

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the United States reported in April 1995 (three months before Srebrenica massacre) that nearly 90 percent of all the atrocities in the Yugoslav wars up to that point had been perpetrated by Serb militants. Most of these atrocities occurred in Bosnia.

==== Insurgency in Kosovo (1995–1998) ====

After September 1990 when the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution had been unilaterally repealed by the Socialist Republic of Serbia, Kosovo&#x27;s autonomy suffered and so the region was faced with state-organized oppression: from the early 1990s, Albanian language radio and television were restricted and newspapers shut down. Kosovar Albanians were fired in large numbers from public enterprises and institutions, including banks, hospitals, the post office and schools. In June 1991, the University of Priština assembly and several faculty councils were dissolved and replaced by Serbs. Kosovar Albanian teachers were prevented from entering school premises for the new school year beginning in September 1991, forcing students to study at home.

In the 1990s, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) was formed. They started carrying out attacks on Serb civilians. By the early 1990s, there were attacks on Serbian police forces and secret-service officials in retaliation for the abuse and murder of Albanian civilians. A Serbian policeman was killed in 1995, allegedly by the KLA. The KLA sought to destabilize the region, hoping the United States and NATO would intervene. Serbian patrols were ambushed and policemen were killed. It was only in the next year that the KLA organization took responsibility for these attacks.

The KLA, originally composed of a few hundred Albanians, attacked several police stations and wounded many police officers in 1996–1997. In February 1996 the KLA undertook a series of attacks against police stations and Yugoslav government employees, saying that the Yugoslav authorities had killed Albanian civilians as part of an ethnic cleansing campaign. On 22 April 1996, four attacks on Serbian security personnel were carried out almost simultaneously in several parts of Kosovo.

In January 1997, Serbian security forces assassinated KLA commander Zahir Pajaziti and two other leaders in a highway attack between Pristina and Mitrovica, and arrested more than 100 Albanian militants. Adem Jashari, as one of the founders and leaders of the KLA, was convicted of terrorism &quot;in absentia&quot; by a Yugoslav court on 11 July 1997. Human Rights Watch subsequently described the trial, in which fourteen other Kosovo Albanians were also convicted, as &quot;[failing] to conform to international standards&quot;.

The NATO North Atlantic Council claimed the KLA was &quot;the main initiator of the violence&quot; and that it had &quot;launched what appears to be a deliberate campaign of provocation&quot;. Pursuing Jashari for the murder of a Serb policeman, the Serbian forces again attempted to assault the Jashari compound in Prekaz on 22 January 1998. Between 1991 and 1997, mostly in 1996–97, 39 persons were killed by the KLA. Attacks between 1996 and February 1998 led to the deaths of 10 policemen and 24 civilians.

====Kosovo War (1998–1999)====

&lt;section begin=KosovoWar /&gt;
A NATO-facilitated ceasefire between the KLA and Yugoslav forces was signed on 15 October 1998, but both sides broke it two months later and fighting resumed. When the killing of 45 Kosovar Albanians in the Račak massacre was reported in January 1999, NATO decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force to forcibly restrain the two sides. Yugoslavia refused to sign the Rambouillet Accords, which among other things called for 30,000 NATO peacekeeping troops in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory; immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law; and the right to use local roads, ports, railways, and airports without payment and requisition public facilities for its use free of cost. NATO then prepared to install the peacekeepers by force, using this refusal to justify the bombings.&lt;section end=KosovoWar /&gt;

The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia followed, an intervention against Serbian forces with a mainly bombing campaign, under the command of General Wesley Clark. Hostilities ended months later with the Kumanovo Agreement. Kosovo was placed under the governmental control of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the military protection of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). The 15-month war had left thousands of civilians killed on both sides and over a million displaced.

====Insurgency in the Preševo Valley (1999–2001)====

The Insurgency in the Preševo Valley was an armed conflict between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and ethnic-Albanian insurgents of the Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac (UÇPMB), beginning in June 1999. There were instances during the conflict in which the Yugoslav government requested KFOR support in suppressing UÇPMB attacks, since the government could only use lightly armed military forces as part of the Kumanovo Agreement, which created a buffer zone so the bulk of the Yugoslav armed forces could not enter. Yugoslav president Vojislav Koštunica warned that fresh fighting would erupt if KFOR units did not act to prevent the attacks that were coming from the UÇPMB.

====Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia (2001)====

The insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia was an armed conflict in the northwestern part of the country which began when the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army (NLA) militant group began attacking the security forces of the Republic of Macedonia at the end of January 2001, and ended with the Ohrid Agreement in August. The goal of the NLA was to give greater rights and autonomy to the country&#x27;s Albanian minority, who made up 25.2% of the population of the Republic of Macedonia (54.7% in Tetovo). There were also claims that the group ultimately wished to see Albanian-majority areas secede from the country, although high-ranking NLA members have denied this.

==Arms embargo==
The United Nations Security Council had imposed an arms embargo in September 1991. Nevertheless, various states had been engaged in, or facilitated, arms sales to the warring factions. In 2012, Chile convicted nine people, including two retired generals, for their part in arms sales.

==War crimes==
=== Genocide ===
It is widely believed that mass murders against Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina escalated into genocide. On 18 December 1992, the United Nations General Assembly issued resolution 47/121 condemning &quot;aggressive acts by the Serbian and Montenegrin forces to acquire more territories by force&quot; and called such ethnic cleansing &quot;a form of genocide&quot;. Genocide scholars consider the term &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; itself a euphemism for genocide denial created by Slobodan Milošević and Serbian propagandists.

In its report published on 1 January 1993, Helsinki Watch was one of the first civil rights organisations that warned that &quot;the extent of the violence and its selective nature along ethnic and religious lines suggest crimes of genocidal character against Muslim and, to a lesser extent, Croatian populations in Bosnia-Hercegovina&quot;.

A telegram sent to the White House on 8 February 1994 by U.S. Ambassador to Croatia, Peter W. Galbraith, stated that genocide was occurring. The telegram cited &quot;constant and indiscriminate shelling and gunfire&quot; of Sarajevo by Karadzic&#x27;s Yugoslav People Army; the harassment of minority groups in Northern Bosnia &quot;in an attempt to force them to leave&quot;; and the use of detainees &quot;to do dangerous work on the front lines&quot; as evidence that genocide was being committed. In 2005, the United States Congress passed a resolution declaring that &quot;the Serbian policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing meet the terms defining genocide&quot;.

A trial took place before the International Court of Justice, following a 1993 suit by Bosnia and Herzegovina against Serbia and Montenegro alleging genocide. The ICJ ruling of 26 February 2007 indirectly determined the war&#x27;s nature to be international, though clearing Serbia of direct responsibility for the genocide committed by the forces of Republika Srpska in Srebrenica. The ICJ concluded, however, that Serbia failed to prevent genocide committed by Serb forces in Srebrenica and failed to punish those responsible, and bring them to justice.

War crimes were conducted simultaneously by different Serb forces in different parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in Bijeljina, Sarajevo, Prijedor, Zvornik, Višegrad and Foča. The judges however ruled that the criteria for genocide with the specific intent (&quot;dolus specialis&quot;) to destroy Bosnian Muslims were met only in Srebrenica in 1995. The court concluded that other crimes, outside Srebrenica, committed during the 1992–1995 war, may amount to crimes against humanity according to the international law, but that these acts did not, in themselves, constitute genocide per se.

The crime of genocide in the Srebrenica enclave was confirmed in several guilty verdicts handed down by the ICTY, most notably in the conviction of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić.

=== Ethnic cleansing ===

Ethnic cleansing was a common phenomenon in the wars in Croatia, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This entailed intimidation, forced expulsion, or killing of the unwanted ethnic group as well as the destruction of the places of worship, cemeteries and cultural and historical buildings of that ethnic group in order to alter the population composition of an area in the favour of another ethnic group which would become the majority. These examples of territorial nationalism and territorial aspirations are part of the goal of an ethno-state. Detention camps such as Omarska and Trnopolje were also designated as an integral part of the overall ethnic cleansing strategy of the authorities.

According to numerous ICTY verdicts and indictments, Serb and Croat forces performed ethnic cleansing of their territories planned by their political leadership to create ethnically pure states (Republika Srpska and Republic of Serbian Krajina by the Serbs; and Herzeg-Bosnia by the Croats).

According to the ICTY, Serb forces from the SAO Krajina deported at least 80–100,000 Croats and other non-Serb civilians in 1991–92. The total number of exiled Croats and other non-Serbs range from 170,000 (ICTY), to a quarter of a million people (Human Rights Watch). The number of Croats in Serb-occupied Republic of Serbian Krajina dropped from 203,656 (37% of population) in 1991 to 4,000 by early 1995. Also, at least 700,000 to as many as 863,000 Albanians were deported from Kosovo in 1999. More than 80% of the total population of Kosovo was displaced by June 1999. Further hundreds of thousands of Muslims were forced out of their homes by the Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. By one estimate, the Serb forces drove at least 700,000 Bosnian Muslims from the area of Bosnia under their control. According to a 1994 U.N. report, Croatian forces also engaged in ethnic cleansing against Serbs in eastern and western Slavonia and parts of the Krajina region, though on a more restricted scale and in lesser numbers.

Survivors of the ethnic cleansing were left severely traumatized as a consequence of this campaign.

===Wartime sexual violence and rape===

War rape occurred as a matter of official orders as part of ethnic cleansing, to displace the targeted ethnic group. According to the Trešnjevka Women&#x27;s Group, more than 35,000 women and children were held in such Serb-run &quot;rape camps&quot;. Dragoljub Kunarac, Radomir Kovač, and Zoran Vuković were convicted of crimes against humanity for rape, torture, and enslavement committed during the Foča massacres.

The evidence of the magnitude of rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina prompted the ICTY to openly deal with these abuses. Reports of sexual violence during the Bosnian War (1992–1995) and Kosovo War (1998–1999) perpetrated by the Serbian regular and irregular forces have been described as &quot;especially alarming&quot;. The NATO-led Kosovo Force documented rapes of Albanian, Roma and Serbian women by both Serbs and members of the Kosovo Liberation Army.

Others have estimated that during the Bosnian War, between 20,000 and 50,000 women, mostly Bosniak, were raped. There are few reports of rape and sexual assault between members of the same ethnic group.

War rape in the Yugoslav Wars has often been characterized as a crime against humanity. Rapes which were perpetrated by Serb forces served to destroy the cultural and social ties which existed between the victims and their communities. Serbian policies allegedly urged soldiers to rape Bosniak women until they became pregnant as an attempt towards ethnic cleansing. Serbian soldiers hoped to force Bosniak women to carry Serbian children through repeated rape. Often Bosniak women were held in captivity for an extended period of time and only released slightly before the birth of a child conceived of rape. The systematic rape of Bosniak women may have carried further-reaching repercussions than the initial displacement of rape victims. Stress, caused by the trauma of rape, coupled with the lack of access to reproductive health care often experienced by displaced peoples, led to serious health risks for victimized women.

During the Kosovo War, thousands of Kosovo Albanian women and girls became victims of sexual violence. War rape was used as a weapon of war and it was also used as an instrument of systematic ethnic cleansing; rape was used to terrorize the civilian population, extort money from families, and force people to flee their homes. According to a report by the Human Rights Watch group in 2000, rape in the Kosovo War can generally be subdivided into three categories: rapes in women&#x27;s homes, rapes during flight, and rapes in detention. The majority of the perpetrators were Serbian paramilitaries, but also included Serbian special police or Yugoslav army soldiers. Virtually all of the sexual assaults Human Rights Watch documented were gang rapes involving at least two perpetrators. Since the end of the war, rapes of Serbian, Albanian, and Roma women by ethnic Albanians – sometimes by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) – have been documented, but they have not occurred on a similar scale. Rapes frequently occurred in the presence, and with the acquiescence, of military officers. Soldiers, police, and paramilitaries often raped their victims in the full view of numerous witnesses.

A 2013 report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Croatia entitled &#x27;Assessment of the Number of Sexual Violence Victims during the Homeland War on the Territory of the Republic of Croatia and Optimal Forms of Compensation and Support of Victims&#x27;, determined the estimated victims (male and female) of rape and other forms of sexual assault on both sides to number between approximately 1,470 and 2,205 or 1,501 and 2,437 victims. Most victims were non-Serbs assaulted by Serbs. By region, the largest number of rapes and acts of sexual violence occurred in Eastern Slavonia, with an estimated 380–570 victims. According to the UNDP report, between 300 and 600 men (4.4–6.6% of those imprisoned) and between 279 and 466 women (or 30–50% of those imprisoned) suffered from various forms of sexual abuse while being held in Serbian detention camps and prisons (including those in Serbia proper). Between 412 and 611 Croat women were raped in the Serb-occupied territories, outside of detention camps, from 1991 to 1995. Croat forces were also known to have committed rapes and acts of sexual violence against Serb women during Operations Flash and Storm, with an estimated 94–140 victims. Sexual abuse of Serb prisoners also occurred in the Croat-run Lora and Kerestinec camps.

== Humanitarian consequences and material damage ==
===Casualties===
Some estimates put the number of killed in the Yugoslav Wars at 140,000. The Humanitarian Law Center estimates that in the conflicts in former Yugoslav republics at least 130,000 people lost their lives. Slovenia&#x27;s involvement in the conflicts was brief, thus avoiding higher casualties, and around 70 people were killed in its ten-day conflict. The War in Croatia left an estimated 22,000 people dead, of which 15,000 were Croats and 7,000 Serbs.

Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered the heaviest burden of the fighting: between 97,207 and 102,622 people were killed in the war, including 64,036 Bosniaks, 24,905 Serbs, and 7,788 Croats. By share, 65% of the killed were Bosniaks, 25% Serbs, and 8% Croats. In the Kosovo conflict, 13,535 people were killed, including 10,812 Albanians (80%) and 2,197 Serbs (16%). The highest death toll was in Sarajevo: with around 14,000 killed during the siege, the city lost almost as many people as the entire war in Kosovo.

In relative and absolute numbers, Bosniaks suffered the heaviest losses: 64,036 of their people were killed in Bosnia, which represents a death toll of over 3% of their entire ethnic group. Of that number, 33,070 Bosniaks were civilians (52%) and 30,966 were soldiers (48%). They experienced the worst plight in the Srebrenica massacre, where the mortality rate of the Bosniak men (irrespective of their age or civilian status) reached 33% in July 1995. 
The share of Bosniaks among all the civilian fatalities during the Bosnian War was around 83%, rising to almost 95% in Eastern Bosnia.

During the War in Croatia, 43.4% of the killed on the Croatian side were civilians.

===Internally displaced persons and refugees===

The Yugoslav Wars caused one of the largest refugee crises in European history. It is estimated that the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo produced about 2.4 million refugees and an additional 2 million internally displaced persons.

The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina caused 2.2 million refugees or displaced, of which over half were Bosniaks. Up until 2001, there were still 650,000 displaced Bosniaks, while 200,000 left the country permanently.

The Kosovo War caused 862,979 Albanian refugees who were either expelled from the Serb forces or fled from the battle front. In addition, 500,000 to 600,000 were internally displaced, which means that, according to the OSCE, almost 90% of all Albanians were displaced from their homes in Kosovo by June 1999. After the end of the war, Albanians returned, but over 200,000 Serbs, Romani and other non-Albanians fled Kosovo. By the end of 2000, Serbia thus became the host of 700,000 Serb refugees or internally displaced from Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia.

From the perspective of asylum for internally displaced or refugees, Croatia took the brunt of the crisis. According to some sources, in 1992 Croatia was the host to almost 750,000 refugees or internally displaced, which represents a quota of almost 16% of its population of 4.7 million inhabitants: these figures included 420 to 450,000 Bosnian refugees, 35,000 refugees from Serbia (mostly from Vojvodina and Kosovo) while a further 265,000 persons from other parts of Croatia itself were internally displaced. This would be equivalent of Germany being a host to 10 million displaced people or France to 8 million people.

Official UNHCR data indicate that Croatia was the host to 287,000 refugees and 344,000 internally displaced in 1993. This is a ratio of 64.7 refugees per 1000 inhabitants. In its 1992 report, UNHCR placed Croatia #7 on its list of 50 most refugee burdened countries: it registered 316 thousand refugees, which is a ratio of 15:1 relative to its total population. Together with those internally displaced, Croatia was the host to at least 648,000 people in need of an accommodation in 1992. In comparison, Macedonia had 10.5 refugees per 1000 inhabitants in 1999.

Slovenia was the host to 45,000 refugees in 1993, which is 22.7 refugees per 1000 inhabitants. Serbia and Montenegro were the host to 479,111 refugees in 1993, which is a ratio of 45.5 refugees per 1000 inhabitants. By 1998 this grew to 502,037 refugees (or 47.7 refugees per 1000 inhabitants). By 2000 the number of refugees fell to 484,391 persons, but the number of internally displaced grew to 267,500, or a combined total of 751,891 persons who were displaced and in need of an accommodation.

===Material damage===

Material and economic damages brought by the conflicts were catastrophic. Bosnia and Herzegovina had a GDP of between $8–9 billion before the war. The government estimated the overall war damages at $50–$70 billion. It also registered a GDP decline of 75% after the war. 60% of the housing in the country had been either damaged or destroyed, which proved a problem when trying to bring all the refugees back home. Bosnia also became the most landmine contaminated country of Europe: 1820 km2 of its territory were contaminated with these explosives, which represent 3.6% of its land surface. Between 3 and 6 million landmines were scattered throughout Bosnia. Five thousand people died from them, of which 1,520 were killed after the war.

In 1999, the Croatian Parliament passed a bill estimating war damages of the country at $37 billion. The government alleges that between 1991 and April 1993 an estimated total of 210,000 buildings in Croatia (including schools, hospitals and refugee camps) were either damaged or destroyed from shelling by the Republic of Serbian Krajina and the JNA forces. Cities affected by the shelling were Karlovac, Gospić, Ogulin, Zadar, Biograd and others. The Croatian government also acknowledged that 7,489 buildings belonging to Croatian Serbs were damaged or destroyed by explosives, arson or other deliberate means by the end of 1992. From January to March 1993 another 220 buildings were also damaged or destroyed. Criminal charges were brought against 126 Croats for such acts.

Sanctions against FR Yugoslavia created a hyperinflation of 300 million percent of the Yugoslav dinar. By 1995, almost 1 million workers lost their jobs while the gross domestic product had fallen 55 percent since 1989. The 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia resulted in additional damages. One of the most severe was the bombing of the Pančevo petrochemical factory, which caused the release of 80,000 tonnes of burning fuel into the environment. Approximately 31,000 rounds of depleted Uranium ammunition were used during this bombing.

==International war crimes trials: ICTY/IRMCT==
The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was a body of the United Nations established to prosecute serious crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars, and to try their perpetrators. The tribunal was an ad hoc court located in The Hague, Netherlands. One of the most prominent trials involved ex-Serbian President Slobodan Milošević, who was in 2002 indicted on 66 counts of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide allegedly committed in wars in Kosovo, Bosnia and Croatia. His trial remained incomplete since he died in 2006, before a verdict was reached. Nonetheless, ICTY&#x27;s trial &quot;helped to delegitimize Milosevic&#x27;s leadership&quot;, as one scholar put it.

Several convictions were handed over by the ICTY and its successor, the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT). The first notable verdict confirming genocide in Srebrenica was the case against Serb General Radislav Krstić: he was sentenced in 2001, while the Appeals Chamber confirmed the verdict in 2004. Another verdict was against ex-Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić, who was also convicted for genocide. On 22 November 2017, general Ratko Mladić was sentenced to a life in prison.

Other important convictions included those of ultranationalist Vojislav Šešelj, paramilitary leader Milan Lukić, Bosnian Serb politician Momčilo Krajišnik, Bosnian Serb general Stanislav Galić, who was convicted for the siege of Sarajevo, the former Assistant Minister of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs and Chief of its Public Security Department, Vlastimir Đorđević, who was convicted for crimes in Kosovo, ex-JNA commander Mile Mrkšić as well as both of Republic of Serbian Krajina ex-Presidents Milan Martić and Milan Babić. The follow-up International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals convicted Jovica Stanišić and Franko Simatović, State Security Service officers within the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia, and concluded:

The ICTY also declared about the political goals of the war:
Several Croats, Bosniaks and Albanians were convicted for crimes, as well, including ex-Herzegovina Croat leader Jadranko Prlić and commander Slobodan Praljak, Bosnian Croat military commander Mladen Naletilić, ex-Bosnian Army commander Enver Hadžihasanović and ex-Kosovo commander Haradin Bala.

In the Trial of Gotovina et al, Croatian Generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač were ultimately acquitted on appeal in 2012.

By 2019, based on its statute, the ICTY concluded that the Serb officials were found guilty of persecutions, deportation and/or forcible transfer (crimes against humanity, Article 5) in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Vojvodina. They were also found guilty of murder (crimes against humanity, Article 5) in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo; as well as terror (violations of the laws or customs of war, Article 3) and genocide (Article 4) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Croat forces were not found guilty of anything in Croatia, but were found guilty of deportation, other inhumane acts (forcible transfer), murder and persecutions (crimes against humanity, Article 5) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosniak forces were found guilty of inhuman treatment (grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, Article 2), murder; cruel treatment (violations of the laws or customs of war, Article 3) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. One Albanian official was found guilty of torture, cruel treatment, murder (violations of the laws or customs of war, Article 3) in Kosovo.

==Aftermath==
=== Gunrunning ===
After the fighting ended, millions of weapons were left with civilians who held on to them in case violence should resurface. These weapons later turned up on the arms black market of Europe.

In 2018, there were no exact official figures on how many firearms are missing; in Serbia, authorities have given estimates which range from 250,000 to 900,000, different kinds of firearms are in circulation. In Bosnia, public reports contain a figure of 750,000. At the end of 2017, a man entered a bus in Banja Luka carrying two bags with 36 hand grenades, three assault rifles, seven handguns, a mine and hundreds of cartridges with Gothenburg as the destination. He was stopped in the neighbouring country of Slovenia. A 26-year-old woman was stopped at the border to Croatia with three antitank weapons and a hand grenade. Police found four machine guns, three battle rifles, three assault rifles and a large quantity of explosives at the home of a 79-year-old man. According to a UNDP official, getting civilians to give up their arms to state authorities is complicated as people are then forced to trust that authorities will protect them. Instead, criminals collect the weapons. Some of the missing weapons were used in the November 2015 Paris attacks during which 130 people were killed by jihadists. Other arms were assault rifles which were used in the 2015 Gothenburg pub shooting.

Successor-state governments&#x27; efforts to reduce the prevalence of illegally held arms are co-ordinated through a Regional Approach to Stockpile Reduction (RASR) focused on reducing stockpiles, arms diversion and unexplained explosions in South-east Europe. Partners include the European Union, the US Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement, the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and NATO&#x27;s Support and Procurement Agency. Funded by the US Government, activities include annual workshops attended by US government officials from the Departments of State and Defense and defense ministry representatives from the Yugoslav successor states.

=== Drug trafficking ===
Since the beginning of hostilities between warring factions in the former Yugoslavia, the Kosovo Liberation Army as well as the Serbian mafia have been involved in the illegal drug trade, particularly with West Asian heroin entering Central and Western Europe. In the early 1990s, 2,000 Albanians from Kosovo were held in Swiss jails on charges of arms and drug smuggling. Over the course of the war, a total of several tons of heroin were confiscated by Interpol and local law enforcement. Illegal drug smuggling operations also led to additional crimes all across Western Europe, which included bank robberies and extortion committed by criminal gangs operating out of Eastern Europe. The intensification of heroin consumption in Western Europe led to the expansion of open air drug markets, particularly in Switzerland. Bosnian criminal gangs continue to have a significant impact on global drug trafficking, through entering the lucrative cocaine trade.

<text>Grand Port () is a district of Mauritius, situated in the east of the island. The name means &quot;large port&quot; in French. The district has an area of 260.3 km2 and the estimated population was 112,997, as of 31 December 2015.

==History==
Grand Port is named after the village of &#x27;Old Grand Port&#x27; which saw the first Dutch landing and the first port of the island. It is centered on the town of Mahébourg on the coast, inside the Grand Port Bay. Built by the Dutch and later taken over by the French, the town is a reminder of the colonial past of the island.

In 1810, a French squadron of frigates achieved an ultimately futile naval victory over a comparable British squadron at the Battle of Grand Port, near the Île de la Passe.

==Places of interest==
The district&#x27;s most well known and popular beach is Blue Bay, one of the finest bathing spots on the island surrounded by a semicircle of filao trees. Situated on the southeast coast, not far from Mahébourg, Blue Bay offers a fine stretch of white sandy beach, and a deep, clear, light-blue bathing pool. There is also scope for yachting and windsurfing. Many structures in the district reflect the colonial past of the district.

Just north of Mahebourg, Vallée de Ferney contains indigenous forests and a range of endangered plants and animals. Off the coast, Ile aux Aigrettes is a small island where the original ecosystems of Mauritius have been to some degree rehabilitated. The bay of Grand-bay also known as Mahebourg bay itself offers a relatively well preserved underwater flora and fauna which makes it an ideal snorkeling site.

==Places==
The Grand Port District include different regions; however, some regions are further divided into different suburbs. Midlands and Seizième Mille village council areas are geographically in Plaines Wilhems district and have thus not been included in the places found in Grand Port. However, the residents do vote in local elections for the Grand Port District council. 
Note that the statistics do not take into account that Camp Carol was created out of Trois Boutiques and that Trois Boutiques was renamed Trois Boutiques (Union Vale) in 2011 following the new Local Government Act. The islands only airport of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport is located in the Grand Port District.

<doc id="435503" wikidata="Q918378" url="?curid=435503" title="1935 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The 1935 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 14 November 1935. It resulted in a second (though reduced) landslide victory for the three-party National Government, which was led by Stanley Baldwin of the Conservative Party after the resignation of Ramsay MacDonald due to ill health earlier in the year. It is the most recent British general election to have seen any party or alliance of parties win a majority of the popular vote.

As in 1931, the National Government was a coalition of the Conservatives with small breakaway factions of the Labour and Liberal parties, and the group campaigned together under a shared manifesto on a platform of continuing its work addressing the economic crises caused by the Great Depression. The re-elected government was again dominated by the Conservatives, but, while the National Liberals remained relatively stable in terms of vote share and seats, National Labour lost most of its seats—including that of leader Ramsay MacDonald.

The Labour Party, under what was then regarded internally as the caretaker leadership of Clement Attlee, was the main beneficiary of the swing away from the Conservatives and National Labour. The party achieved its then-best-ever result in terms of share of the popular vote, and won back around half of the seats it had lost in the previous election. The Liberals, who had split from the National Government over the issue of free trade, continued their decline, losing more than half of their seats (including that of leader Sir Herbert Samuel).

The election ushered-in an era of two-party politics dominated by the Conservatives and Labour, which would last until the revival of the Liberals in the 1970s under Jeremy Thorpe. It was also the first election since 1895 where the Independent Labour Party stood separately from the Labour Party, having disaffiliated in 1932. In Scotland, it was the first general election contested by the Scottish National Party, and the Communist Party gained its first seat in ten years (West Fife).

Due to the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 the next general election was not held until 1945. It was also the last election to be held during the reign of George V, who died in January 1936.
== Background ==
National Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald had led the National Government since its victory in 1931, but the Conservatives were by far the largest party within the coalition, with 470 of its 554 seats. MacDonald&#x27;s health was increasingly poor throughout his time as Prime Minister, and in June 1935 he handed his office to Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin.

After the near-wipeout of 1931 saw Labour leader Arthur Henderson lose his seat, George Lansbury became the party&#x27;s new leader. However, as a radical Christian pacifist he strongly opposed rearmament, putting him at odds with his party&#x27;s membership, his own MPs, and many of the party&#x27;s affiliated trade unions, all of whom had begun to view investing in the UK&#x27;s military capabilities as a necessary response to the rising threat of European fascism.

This disagreement came to a head at Labour&#x27;s annual conference in October 1935, where a motion was tabled for the party to endorse sanctions against Italy for its invasion of Abyssinia. Lansbury opposed the motion, but when it passed he decided that his position was untenable and he resigned on 8 October. Baldwin, recognising that the government&#x27;s main opposition was in disarray and seeking a mandate for his new administration, called an election on 19 October, and Parliament was subsequently dissolved on 25 October. Without time to choose a new leader before the general election, Lansbury&#x27;s deputy, Clement Attlee, was appointed interim leader.

As in 1931 the election was dominated by the impact of the Great Depression—in particular persistently high unemployment—and the National Government sought to continue its program of reforms designed to repair the economy. However, foreign policy and defence were significantly more important than in the previous election, with the role of the League of Nations, the increasing belligerence of the Empire of Japan, the remilitarisation of Germany under Adolf Hitler, and the Italian invasion of Abyssinia all key issues. There was a heated internal debate within the National Government over the extent to which rearmament should be pursued in response to the rising threat of another war in Europe. Baldwin was generally opposed to rearmament, and the coalition&#x27;s manifesto reflected his position, promising that rearmament would be &quot;strictly confined to what is required to make the country and the Empire safe.&quot;

The Liberal Party had fractured into three separate factions in 1931 over the question of whether to support the National Government&#x27;s policy of trade protectionism, and it remained just as divided over economic policy in 1935. The party and the Independent Liberal group set up by former leader David Lloyd George had gradually been re-aligning during the previous years, but a full reunification did not occur in time for the election, causing Lloyd George to restrict his personal fortune (which the Liberals had relied on greatly during his time as leader) to funding the campaigns of his allies. Lacking financial resources, the main Liberal Party was only able to put up candidates in 159 constituencies.

== Outcome ==
The election resulted in another landslide for the National Government, with two-thirds of the seats in the House of Commons and a narrow majority of the overall popular vote. This was a less-dominating performance than in 1931—where the coalition had won two-thirds of the vote and 90.1% of seats—but it was still a clear mandate for the National Government to continue its programme of economic reforms.

It remains the most recent election where any party or alliance of parties secured a majority of the popular vote. (The coalition between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats which formed after the 2010 general election represented 59.1% of votes cast, but the two parties campaigned separately.) It was also the last election until 1997 in which any party or alliance of parties won more than 400 seats.

Despite Labour&#x27;s success in terms of vote share—higher than Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s result in 1929, Harold Wilson&#x27;s in February 1974, Tony Blair&#x27;s in 2005, and Keir Starmer&#x27;s in 2024, all of which put the party into government—its total of 154 seats remains its most-recent worst performance, and the party has won more than 200 seats at every general election since. Attlee won Labour&#x27;s subsequent leadership election on 26 November 1935, and he would go on to become the first Labour leader to both win a plurality of votes in a general election and a majority of seats in the House of Commons (in 1945).

Labour&#x27;s revival came at the expense of National Labour, which lost five of its 13 seats, including Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s own seat of Seaham. MacDonald was able to rejoin the Commons thanks to a by-election victory only two months later, in January 1936; however, after his death in November 1937 the party struggled under the new leadership of his son, Malcolm MacDonald, and it eventually disbanded ahead of the 1945 election.

The election also marked the continued decline of the Liberals from a natural party of government into a fringe third-party within a two-party system dominated by the Conservatives and Labour. The 21 seats secured in 1935 and the 12 seats secured at the subsequent 1945 general election were the last occasions that the Liberal Party would win more than ten seats at an election until 1966, and the 1935 election was the last time that the party would win more than 20 seats before its alliance and merger with the Social Democratic Party in the 1980s. The National Liberals within the government, meanwhile, struggled in the following years to differentiate themselves from their coalition partners, and the party&#x27;s small rump of MPs were absorbed into the Conservatives in 1968.

The resulting parliamentary term would see two changes of Prime Minister: Neville Chamberlain took over from Baldwin in 1937, and subsequently formed a new cross-party wartime coalition—which included the Labour and Liberal parties—in 1939 at the outbreak of the Second World War. Chamberlain himself resigned in 1940 and was replaced by Winston Churchill. Due to the war another general election was not held until Allied victory was confirmed in 1945.

<text>Wood Quay () is a riverside area of Dublin that was a site of Viking settlement. It is now the location of the Dublin City Council offices. 
== Location ==
The site is bounded on the north side by Wood Quay on the River Liffey, on the west by Winetavern Street, on the south by John&#x27;s Lane and on the east by Fishamble Street. Two bridges cross the river at Wood Quay, one at the eastern and the other at the western end. The bridge at the eastern end is Grattan Bridge, formerly known as Essex Bridge, named after 18th century parliamentarian Henry Grattan. The bridge at the westerly end of Wood Quay is O&#x27;Donovan Rossa Bridge (formerly Richmond Bridge) named after the 19th century Fenian.

== History ==
===Plans for redevelopment===
Dublin Corporation acquired Wood Quay gradually from the 1950s, having voted on the plans for the new office development on 4-acres in front of Christchurch Cathedral in January 1956 finally. The first design was by Jones and Kelly, and would have completely obscured the view of the cathedral from the quays. After some criticism of the plan, including strong concern from the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, this design was abandoned. By special compulsory purchase order, the Corporation began assembling the site, having the full plot by 1967. At this time, demolition of the existing buildings began, including that of O&#x27;Meara&#x27;s pub on the corner of Winetavern Street.

The Corporation then announced a competition to developers which would see them select a design for the development, publishing a 4-page brief on the requirements. In November 1968, they exhibited the models of the 6 finalists at City Hall. Critical response to the designs was poor, and the fact that it appeared the Corporation themselves would choose the winner with no architectural input was met with shock and derision. After some pressure, a 12 man board of assessors was appointed to select the winning scheme. Desmond Leslie surmised that none of the designs made much effort to lessen their impact on Christchurch Cathedral or to consider it as part of the wider built environment. Among those who entered designs were Desmond FitzGerald, Michael Scott and Partners, and Sam Stephenson. Stephenson&#x27;s design for the Green Property Group was selected as the winner, which a design including 4 office blocks in varying heights from 5 to 10 storeys.

The plans were submitted for planning approval, resulting in two city departments rejecting the plans on technical grounds. However, the city manager, Matt Macken, decided to override these objections and grant full approval on 24 December 1970. More than 30 groups and individuals lodged objections, including the National Monuments Advisory Council. Many also appealed to the relevant minister, Bobby Molloy. An oral hearing was held in March 1971, with Molloy eventually confirming the decision by Macken in July 1972. This approval had 15 conditions, including &quot;that all reasonable opportunities and facilities shall be afforded to the National Monuments Advisory Council to inspect, record and recover matter of archaeological interest&quot; from the site.

===20th century excavations===
Large-scale archaeological excavations were conducted on the site by the National Museum of Ireland at intervals between 1973 and 1981 after some initial exploration of the site in 1969. The excavations stipulated by the planning permission were led by Pat Wallace. They took place over an area of 4 acres, and uncovered 100 dwellings, thousands of objects, and a large amount of environmental evidence which covered 5 centuries of medieval occupation of the site. The site has been characterised as less Viking and more &quot;Hiberno-Scandinavian&quot; or &quot;Hiberno-Norse&quot;, and represented a prosperous commercial centre. The area was also shown to have been densely populated and confirmed the area as one of the earliest inhabited areas of the city.

The excavations were first disrupted in May 1973, after which bulldozers destroyed areas of the site over the course of 3 months, including a newly discovered section of city wall. A cease order was issued in November 1973 by James Tully, the Minister for Local Government. This was met by widespread public approval and emergence of proposals to build an archaeological park on the site in place of the office development, despite the fact the site was a north-facing, steep one and not suited to becoming a public park. During this period of hiatus, the Corporation explored other sites to develop, including one on Waterford Street, but these were all rejected. Instead it was proposed that the four blocks be relocated on the site to allow for the unobstructed view of the Cathedral from the quays, the lack of which was highlighted as a concern in the cease order. On 13 February 1974, Tully announced the scheme was go ahead which the office block moved to the Fishamble Street side of the site. An Taisce states this was &quot;worst possible solution&quot; and that the modern office blocks &quot;will never be a success and it is our opinion is that they will clash with Christchurch Cathedral in a very incongruous manner&quot;.

Finds made during the excavations of the site led to a significant public campaign to halt the development. This was led by Prof. F. X. Martin, who was the chairman of the Friends of Medieval Dublin. The campaign resulted in a large protest march on 23 September 1978, attended by 20,000 people called &quot;Save Wood Quay&quot;. On 1 June 1979, a number of 52 protesters began a three-week sit-in at the site, dubbed &quot;Operation Sitric&quot;. Among those in the group was the architect Michael Scott, poet Eavan Boland, writer Mary Lavin, and Rita Childers. Over 80 cultural and social groups, including the Council of Europe, appealed for the site to be preserved. The Irish High Court deemed the site to be a National Monument, but the Corporation and the Commissioners of Public Works subverted this. Ulick O&#x27;Connor commented that the clear rejection of the desires of the public both through protest and local elections to save the site was &quot;the most terrifying event in this country over the past twenty years&quot;. The development went ahead, but the extra time spent over the protests and legal battles over the preservation of the site meant that the excavations were more extension than initially planned. Though parts of the excavations are deemed to have been rushed and incomplete due to manner in which the work unfolded.

Artefacts from the excavations are now on display in the National Museum of Ireland. The large volume of objects excavated from the site is due to the fact the soil conditions were anaerobic, allowing for organic materials, predominately made of wood, to be very well preserved. From the objects discovered, it establishes that not only were agricultural goods traded, but also luxuries like combs and jewellery. The excavations were concluded in March 1981, and now most of the quay is occupied by Dublin City Council&#x27;s Civic Offices which opened in 1986. While ultimately the campaign for the preservation of Wood Quay was not successful, it highlighted the lack of legal protection for sites of this nature, which has since been addressed.

===The office development===
During the hiatus in the project during the early 1970s, and the resulting reconfiguration of the site, Stephenson reworked his original designs. Rather than the initial pre-cast blocks, with flat roofs, and projecting windows, the new design featured chamfered roofs, granite cladding and deep-recessed slit windows. The Corporation was exempt from requiring fresh planning permission for such a radical redesign. With the cost of the development rising, the Corporation decided to split the development into 2 phases.

The journalist Frank MacDonald cited Stephenson&#x27;s admiration of the German architect Albert Speer as influential on the buildings&#x27; stark design. The first phase of the development cost over £20 million, with the 2 granite faced blocks the most expensive office blocks built in Dublin at the time of their completion. This was ten times the original estimate for redeveloping the entire site in 1967. The large cost overruns resulted in the rest of the development being put on hold.

== Later developments ==
In a later excavation between 1990 and 1993 further along the quay at Lower Exchange Street, an archaeological dig team unearthed a roundtower-like ruin from the 13th century called Isolde&#x27;s Tower. This tower was first discovered in the 17th century, but most of it was destroyed and covered in. Because of the dig, the construction of underground parking facilities for a planned development on the site could not be constructed at their intended location. The tower ruins are now viewable through railings on Lower Exchange Street, and the car park ramp is further to the left.

<text>The Tashkent Television Tower () is a tower, located in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and is the twelfth tallest tower in the world. Construction started in 1978. The tower began operating six years later, on 15 January 1985. It was the fourth tallest tower in the world from 1985 to 1991. The decision to construct the tower was made on 1 September 1971 in order to spread TV and radio signals to all over Uzbekistan. It is a vertical cantilever structure, and is constructed out of steel. Its architectural design is a product of the Terkhiev, Tsarukov &amp; Semashko firm.

The tower has an observation deck located above the ground. It is the second tallest structure in Central Asia after Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Station in Ekibastuz, Kazakhstan. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers.

==Use==
The main purposes of the tower are radio and TV-transmission. The signal reaches the farthest points of Tashkent Region and some of the southern regions of Kazakhstan. The tower is also used for communication between governmental departments, and organizations. The tower also serves as a complex hydrometeorological station.

<doc id="435508" wikidata="Q41152" url="?curid=435508" title="Akebono Tarō">
<text>was an American-born Japanese professional sumo wrestler and professional wrestler from Waimānalo, Hawaii. Joining sumo in Japan in 1988, he was trained by pioneering Hawaiian wrestler Takamiyama and rose swiftly up the rankings, reaching the top division in 1990. After two consecutive &quot;yusho&quot; or tournament championships in November 1992 and January 1993 he made history by becoming the first non-Japanese-born wrestler ever to reach &quot;yokozuna&quot;, the highest rank in sumo.

One of the tallest and heaviest wrestlers ever, Akebono&#x27;s rivalry with the young Japanese hopefuls, Takanohana and Wakanohana, was a big factor in the increased popularity of sumo at tournament venues and on TV in the early 1990s. During his eight years at the &quot;yokozuna&quot; rank, Akebono won a further eight tournament championships, for a career total of eleven, and was a runner-up on thirteen other occasions, despite suffering several serious injuries. Although his rival &quot;yokozuna&quot; Takanohana won more tournaments in this period, their individual head-to-heads remained very close.

Akebono became a Japanese citizen in 1996, and after retiring in 2001 he worked as a coach at Azumazeki stable before leaving the Sumo Association in 2003. After an unsuccessful period as a K-1 fighter, he became a professional wrestler. In All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) he was a two-time Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion, two-time World Tag Team Champion, and two-time All Asia Tag Team Champion. He also won the 2015 Champion Carnival. He retired from professional wrestling in 2017 due to health problems.

==Early life==
Chad Rowan was born on 8 May 1969, to Randolph and Janice Rowan, and was of Hawaiian descent. He grew up with two younger brothers, one of whom, Ola, also became a sumo wrestler for a brief period after Chad. He attended Kaiser High School, where he played basketball and became an all-star center. He went to Hawaii Pacific University on a basketball scholarship, but sat out his freshman season.

== Sumo career ==

=== Early career ===
Rowan was planning to study for a career in hotel management, but he had always been interested in sumo from watching television broadcasts. A family friend introduced him to Azumazeki Oyakata, the former Takamiyama, who also originally hailed from Hawaii. Azumazeki overcame his initial concerns that Rowan might be too tall and his legs too long for sumo and agreed to let him join his Azumazeki stable, founded in 1986. Rowan flew to Japan in early 1988. Adopting the &quot;shikona&quot; of Akebono, meaning &quot;new dawn&quot; in Japanese, he made his professional debut in March 1988. This entry cohort was one of the most successful ever, producing two other &quot;yokozuna&quot;, Takanohana and Wakanohana (sons of the popular champion from the 1970s, Takanohana Kenshi), as well as a great &quot;ōzeki&quot;, Kaiō.

Akebono rose rapidly through the ranks, equaling the record for the most consecutive &quot;kachi-koshi&quot; (majority of wins in a sumo tournament) from debut, reaching &quot;sekiwake&quot; before suffering his first &quot;make-koshi&quot; or losing record. He was promoted to &quot;jūryō&quot; in March 1990, the first &quot;sekitori&quot; from his stable, and to &quot;makuuchi&quot; in September of the same year. He made his top division debut in the same tournament as Wakanohana, as well as Takatōriki and Daishōyama. In the November 1990 tournament he was awarded his first special prize, for Fighting Spirit, and in January 1991 he earned his first gold star for defeating &quot;yokozuna&quot; Asahifuji. In March 1991 he defeated &quot;ōzeki&quot; Konishiki in the first ever match between two non-Japanese wrestlers in the top division.

=== Promotion ===
In 1992, after a year of 8–7 or 7–8 records near the top of the &quot;makuuchi&quot; division, Akebono suddenly came alive with a 13–2 record in January of that year, narrowly losing the top division championship to Takanohana. A second 13–2 record two tournaments later, in May, saw him win the top division championship for the first time, and with it promotion to &quot;ōzeki&quot;. After an injury during the summer, he went on to win consecutive championships in November 1992 and January 1993 to win promotion to &quot;yokozuna&quot;.

At the time of his promotion, the rank of &quot;yokozuna&quot; had been vacant for eight months (an exceedingly rare occurrence) and his promotion, despite the fact that he was the first foreign &quot;yokozuna&quot;, was welcomed by many. He had met the stipulation of winning two consecutive tournaments that had been mentioned by the Yokozuna Deliberation Council when turning down Konishiki the previous year, and was also seen as having conducted himself with the dignity and humility necessary for such an exalted rank. One commentator remarked, &quot;He makes me forget he is a foreigner because of his earnest attitude toward sumo.&quot;

=== &quot;Yokozuna&quot; era ===
Akebono was a long-standing and strong &quot;yokozuna&quot;, lasting nearly eight years in the rank and winning the top division championship on a further eight occasions. His career highlights include the rare achievement of winning the top division championship in three consecutive tournaments, in 1993. In July 1993 he beat Takanohana and Wakanohana in consecutive matches to win the &quot;honbasho&quot; when all three ended up tied at the end of the 15-day tournament, and in May 1997 he defeated Takanohana twice on the final day, once in their regular match and once in a playoff, to win his first title in over two years. The competition between Akebono and Takanohana, who reached &quot;yokozuna&quot; himself in 1995, was said to be one of the great defining rivalries of postwar sumo. The two finished their careers with a 25–25 tie in bouts against one another. At the opening ceremony of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, a professional sumo wrestler was chosen to represent each of the competing countries and lead them into the stadium. After Takanohana fell ill, Akebono was given the honor of representing Japan in the opening ceremony. Akebono also led other sumo wrestlers in a ring cleansing ceremony at the Opening Ceremony (also meant to cleanse the stadium itself).

Akebono suffered frequent injuries during his career. His first serious knee injury came in May 1994 when, after winning his first ten matches of the tournament, he lost a bout to Takatōriki and fell awkwardly. He flew to Los Angeles and underwent career-saving surgery. From November 1998 to March 1999 he missed three successive tournaments due to a herniated disc in his lower back and faced calls for his retirement. After receiving the personal backing of the Chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, he scored a respectable 11–4 record in his comeback tournament in May 1999. In 2000 he enjoyed his first completely injury-free year since 1993 and won two tournaments, finishing as runner-up in three others. He won 76 bouts out of a possible 90, the best record of any wrestler that year.

=== Fighting style ===
Akebono was one of the tallest sumo wrestlers ever, at tall, and also one of the heaviest with a peak weight of in March 1999. He was also one of the most aggressive and ferocious sumo wrestlers. Despite having long legs, considered a disadvantage in sumo as it tends to make one top heavy and susceptible to throws, he covered for this by training exceptionally hard, and using his long reach to thrust his opponents out of the &quot;dohyō&quot; (ring). In his prime, he had incredible thrusting strength and on many occasions would blast lesser wrestlers out of the ring in one or two strokes using &quot;tsuppari&quot; techniques. His most common winning &quot;kimarite&quot; was &quot;oshi-dashi&quot;, a simple push out, and he also regularly won by &quot;tsuki-dashi&quot;, the thrust out. In later years he also used his reach to more often grab his opponent&#x27;s &quot;mawashi&quot;, or belt, and then use his weight and power to force the opponent from the ring by &quot;yori-kiri&quot;. He liked a &quot;migi-yotsu&quot;, or left hand outside, right hand inside grip, and was fond of using his left hand to employ &quot;uwatenage&quot;, or overarm throw.

=== Retirement ===
After winning his eleventh top division title in November 2000, Akebono suffered another injury and, after sitting out the tournament in January 2001, he decided to retire rather than face a daunting struggle back to fighting fitness. Upon retirement, his topknot was ceremonially cut off in the ring by 320 of his friends and previous opponents in front of 11,000 people. After his retirement, he became a member (or elder) of the Japan Sumo Association as a coach, or &quot;oyakata&quot;, and worked with his former mentor in the Azumazeki stable. He helped train the Mongolian wrestler Asashōryū who also became a &quot;yokozuna&quot;, and Akebono instructed him on how to perform the &quot;dohyō-iri&quot;, or &quot;yokozuna&quot; ring-entering ceremony.

While an &quot;oyakata&quot;, Akebono also appeared in TV commercials and opened a restaurant called ZUNA.

In June 2013 he returned to Azumazeki stable for the first time since leaving the Sumo Association to oversee some training sessions as an assistant instructor.

== Kickboxing and mixed martial arts career ==

Akebono left the Sumo Association in November 2003 to join K-1. The decision was influenced by financial problems due to the failure of his restaurant, among other financial difficulties. His &quot;koenkai&quot;, or supporters network, had dissolved after his marriage in 1998, depriving him of a valuable source of income. In addition, he earned far less as an &quot;oyakata&quot; than he had as a &quot;yokozuna&quot;. K-1 offered him a chance to clear his debts by fighting for them.

=== K-1 ===
==== 2003–2004 ====
At the time of his debut, Akebono was involved in a highly publicized matchup at K-1 Premium 2003 against popular superheavyweight fighter Bob Sapp. The combined popularity of Sapp and Akebono attracted a crowd of 45,000 to the Nagoya Dome and granted the event a 43% viewership, making it the first time a combat sports event outdrew the NHK music festival &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;, Japan&#x27;s traditionally biggest New Year show. The classical matchup of an American foreigner like Sapp against a Japanese national like Taro, a cultural contraposition, also gained comparisons with Japanese professional wrestling legend Rikidōzan in his bouts against The Sharpe Brothers. The match was short and intense. Outweighing Sapp by over 150 pounds, Akebono pushed him toward the ring corners with energetic, fast punches, but his stamina fell minutes into the round. The more experienced Sapp then attacked him with low kicks and punching combinations to the head and body, knocking the &quot;yokozuna&quot; down twice before finishing him by KO at 2:58.

Some months later, Akebono followed with another high level match, this time against the famed Musashi. Akebono had improved his conditioning under Ray Sefo and Fai Falamoe and outweighed Musashi by more than twice his weight, so there was expectation about his performance. As expected, Akebono started strong, overwhelming Musashi with sumo charges against the ropes through the first round. He shocked the crowd with unsportsmanlike conduct in the second, as he suddenly started unloading illegal hooks and rabbit punches on a seated Musashi when the latter slipped and fell. Referee Nobuaki Kakuda warned Akebono while the fight looked to be stopped in a DQ, but a still dazed Musashi insisted to keep on. The fight continued for the remnant time, but although Akebono achieved a significant offense, Musashi ultimately rallied up with punches and several kinds of kicks, controlling the exchanges. After Akebono ended the match with a new foul, a sumo throw, unanimous decision was given to his opponent.

After another decision loss against Chinese fighter Zhang Qingjun in South Korea, Akebono travelled to United States to fight American legend Rick Roufus in K-1 Las Vegas. During the fight, Roufus avoided being cornered by Akebono&#x27;s pushes and counterattacked with ineffective kicks and punches. Again, Akebono showed an unsportsmanlike side when he tried repeatedly to throw Roufus out of the ring, leading referee Cecil Peoples to warn him. At one point, Akebono even pushed away Peoples himself. Due to the fouls and to Roufus&#x27;s incessant attacks, decision was given to the American.

The next month, Akebono faced Dutch striker Remy Bonjasky back in Japan. Ignoring his opponent&#x27;s signature high kicks, Akebono pressed with punches and pushes, but Bonjasky kept dodging and attacking, even landing a sharp kick to the head by springing from the top rope. The bout transpired this way until the third round, when Bonjasky scored a roundhouse kick that knocked Akebono out.

At the end of the year, Akebono had his mixed martial arts debut against Ultimate Fighting Championship pioneer Royce Gracie at K-1 Premium 2004. The bout was not easy to negotiate, as Royce demanded it to be refereed by John McCarthy, former UFC referee and Gracie&#x27;s trainee, or he would not fight. The &quot;yokozuna&quot; had trained now under Maz Tanaka and would be Gracie&#x27;s biggest opponent, so some believed he could overcome the Brazilian jiu-jitsu groundwork by smothering him with his large size advantage. Come the match, Akebono charged toward Gracie and pushed him to the ground, where he passed his guard momentarily before the Brazilian escaped to his feet. Gracie then seized Akebono&#x27;s arm and locked in an omoplata/wristlock combination, forcing a submission. Akebono was disappointed with his performance: &quot;I did everything my trainers told me not to do.&quot;

====2005–2006====
In March 2005, Akebono was granted a place in the K-1 Korea Grand Prix, whose first round saw him facing Nobuaki Kakuda, a 44 years old Seidokaikan Karate fighter who usually refereed his matches. Through his usual strategy, Akebono surprisingly dominated the match, as Kakuda was unable to mount an offense. After wearing Kakuda down with knees and uppercuts while leaving him no space to counterattack, Akebono was given his first win by unanimous decision. He would advance round to face a fellow superheavyweight, Choi Hong-man, who had just defeated another former sumo wrestler in Wakashoyo. It would be the first time Akebono found an enemy capable to outwrestle him, given Choi&#x27;s 350 pounds and strong ssireum background, and it showed when the Korean stopped Akebono&#x27;s first charges, capitalizing too on his large reach to strike freely. The match was stopped at 24 seconds when Akebono&#x27;s corner threw the towel.

Akebono and Choi rematched in July at K-1 Grand Prix event in Hawaii. Akebono lasted longer, but he found the same problems as the first time, with Choi scoring repeated jabs from the safety of his reach while he blocked the sumo&#x27;s push and charge style. Akebono was eventually knocked down, and although he resumed his attack, Choi knocked him out to end the match. Akebono then returned to MMA format to end the year, going against former comedian Bobby Ologun at K-1 Premium. The sumo champion neutralized Ologun&#x27;s striking by taking him down and smothering him during the earlier rounds, but he was later stunned by a barrage of punches and controlled for the rest of the match, losing the decision.

In 2006, Akebono had his third mixed martial arts match against another Ultimate Fighting Championship veteran, Don Frye, at K-1&#x27;s Hero&#x27;s 5 event. As usual, Akebono used his size, charging through Frye&#x27;s punches and clinching him against the ropes and corners. He controlled the first round, but became fatigued at the second, moment in which Frye came back with punches, dropping Akebono multiple times. After some ground and pound, Frye locked a guillotine choke for the win. A rubber match between Akebono and Choi Hong-man happened then, in which would be Akebono&#x27;s last bout under kickboxing rules. He tried his best to control the fight, but Choi did the same, delivering even a flying knee during the first round. At the last of the second round, the Korean landed a left hook that knocked Akebono out.

Akebono&#x27;s last MMA match saw him meeting professional wrestler Giant Silva, another sizable opponent. The rikishi started the match pushing Silva against the ropes, both of them almost falling out of the ring due to the combined weight, but Silva interrupted his attack by locking a Kimura lock standing. Although they went to the mat with Akebono on top, Silva finally rolled him over and submitted him to the hold. With this last result, Akebono managed only one win in 14 bouts in his K-1 and mixed martial arts career. Because of this, he was referred to as &quot;Makebono&quot; (&quot;make&quot; meaning &quot;lose&quot; in Japanese) by some fight fans and magazines in Japan.

===Rizin Fighting Federation===
Akebono fought a rematch against Bob Sapp on 31 December 2015, at Rizin Fighting Federation Grand Prix event. He lost the fight by technical decision when a cut on his head could not be stemmed.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== World Wrestling Entertainment (2005) ===
On March 29, 2005, Akebono made an appearance on what would be the March 31, 2005 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in Houston, Texas to accept the Big Show&#x27;s challenge to a (kayfabe) sumo match at the WrestleMania 21 pay-per-view in Los Angeles, California. Akebono made his wrestling debut later that night, defeating jobber Eddie Vegas. At WrestleMania 21, Akebono defeated Big Show with a koshinage, throwing him entirely out of the ring.

On 1 July, Akebono made an appearance in a house show in Japan to help Big Show during a match against Carlito after Carlito&#x27;s bodyguard Matt Morgan had interfered. The next day, Akebono teamed with Big Show to defeat Carlito and Morgan in a tag team match.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (2005-2007) ===
On 4 August 2005, Akebono made his official wrestling debut in Japan, appearing at AJPW&#x27;s Wrestle-1 event against the Great Muta in the first match of the Wrestle-1 Grand Prix Tournament, in a losing effort. The same month, it was announced that Akebono had been hired by AJPW and placed under the tutelage of Keiji Mutoh, the Great Muta&#x27;s true identity. Akebono took on the role of Mutoh&#x27;s enforcer and forming a tag team called &quot;Mutoh Room&quot; to combat the heel stable Voodoo-Murders. On 19 November, Akebono defeated Voodoo-Murders member Giant Bernard in a singles match. The same night, Akebono appeared in a match between The Great Muta and the imposter The Great Ruta to defend Muta from Voodoo-Murders, showing his own Muta impersonation called The Great Bono.

Later, Akebono and Mutoh competed in the Real World Tag League 2005, during the tournament, making it all the way to the finals, but were defeated by Team 3D. At the end of the year, Akebono won the Tokyo Sports award for &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; and &quot;Team of the Year&quot; with Mutoh, who then stated that Akebono had successfully graduated from his lessons, and was then released from his contract to move to other companies and gain experience.

=== New Japan Pro Wrestling (2006–2007) ===
On 4 January 2006, Akebono appeared in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) alongside Yutaka Yoshie in a match against Black Strong Machine and Hiro Saito, coming out victorious. Later that month, Akebono competed for Pro Wrestling NOAH, teaming up with his old friend Takeshi Rikio to defeat Junji Izumida and Kenta Kobashi. After the match, Akebono announced that he had been hired by NJPW and was congratulated by Rikio, promising to team again in the future, which never happened due to Rikio having to retire due to his injuries in 2010.

In February, Akebono made his official debut in New Japan as an ally of Riki Choshu, defeating then IWGP Tag Team Champions Cho-Ten (Masahiro Chono and Hiroyoshi Tenzan). On 19 March, he faced Brock Lesnar for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated when Lesnar got the pinfall after hitting him with the title. Months later, after the championship had become vacant, Akebono participated in a tournament for it, defeating Hiroyoshi Tenzan in the first round, but being eliminated by Giant Bernard in the second.

In October, Akebono and Choshu participated in the 2006 G1 Tag League, advancing to the last round before losing to Takashi Iizuka and Yuji Nagata. In August 2007, Akebono participated in the G1 Climax tournament, defeating Togi Makabe and Hiroyoshi Tenzan and completing the tournament with a 2-2-1 record. In October, Akebono and Masahiro Chono competed in the 2007 G1, beating Hirooki Goto and Milano Collection AT, Naofumi Yamamoto and Takashi Iizuka and Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata, but were eliminated in the final stage by Giant Bernard and Travis Tomko. During his stay at New Japan, Akebono began to show his comedic side and began imitating and parodying other fighters. On 13 September 2006, Akebono was presented with a tiger mask and the name of Bono Tiger to team with Tiger Mask IV. On 4 March 2007, he made a brief appearance in Michinoku Pro Wrestling as The Great Bonosuke, fighting on the side of The Great Sasuke wearing the same outfit. On 17 February 2007, Akebono briefly returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling to team with Toru Owashi against Jonidan (Nobutaka Araya) and SUMO Rikishi in an extravagant match between sumos, resulting in a win for his team. After training with Satoru Sayama (the original Tiger Mask) in MMA and pro wrestling, he returned to the New Japan ring to participate in the 2007 G1 Climax tournament. He defeated Togi Makabe and Hiroyoshi Tenzan but failed to progress to the semifinal stage.

=== Hustle (2007–2009) ===

Akebono debuted in Hustle in 2007, being the storyline son of Yinling and The Great Muta. Under the name Monster Bono, Akebono was introduced being unrealistically born from a giant egg before easily defeating RG in his first bout. After that, Monster Bono (who had a simple, childlike personality), under the control of his mother, entered the service of Takada Monster Army and competed against several other wrestlers in a winning streak. Due to the constant abuse from Yinling, and wanting to meet his father, Monster Bono rebelled against it and left the Monster Army, changing his name to Bono-chan and allying with A-chan and Yoshie-chan to form a sumo-style face stable. Soon after, Yinling faced Bono-chan and demanded that he return to the Monster Army, but the outcome of the battle was a victory for Bono-chan, and Yinling (kayfabe) died under his weight. In retaliation to this, Toshiaki Kawada and Mr. Kawada (Toshiaki&#x27;s elder father) scheduled a match between them and Bono and his father, The Great Muta, at Hustlemania 2008. Bono and Muta came victorious, but were attacked by The Esperanza, leading Muta to sacrifice himself to drag Esperanza to the underworld. Without his parents, Bono-chan changed his name to Bono-kun as a sign of maturity and joined the Hustle Army, making a promo based on that of Barack Obama campaign slogan &quot;Yes, We Hustle&quot;. Later in Hustle Aid, before his scheduled match with Genichiro Tenryu against Arma &amp; Geddon, Bono had a strange dream and transformed into The Great Bono, his last stage of maturity. After The Great Bono defeated their opponents with forcefulness, Hustle announced he was leaving to search for his father.

=== Dragon Gate (2008–2010) ===
On 21 September 2008, Akebono appeared in the Battle Royal of Dragon Gate&#x27;s Storm Gate 2008 event, which was won by Akira Tozawa. Akebono made some more appearances, defeating the likes of Stalker Ichikawa, Don Fujii and Masaaki Mochizuki. That month, Akebono, Mochizuki and Fujii agreed to form a trio called Chou Zetsurins to face the team of World-1 (BxB Hulk, Masato Yoshino and PAC) for the Open the Triangle Gate Championship, but were defeated. On 14 October 2009, Chou Zetsurins finally won the title, and defended them until May 2010, when they were defeated by Deep Drunkers (Kzy, Takuya Sugawara and Yasushi Kanda).

=== Pro Wrestling Zero1 (2009–2013) ===
In March 2009, Akebono appeared in Pro Wrestling Zero1 defeating Kohei Sato. Later, Akebono joined the Sword Army stable, led by Masato Tanaka. Akebono also participated in the Fire Festival 2009 defeating several other wrestlers, but failed to win in the end. After that, he formed an irregular team with Shinjiro Otani called Kazan, which defeated Masaaki Mochizuki &amp; Masato Tanaka in the final round of the Furinkazan tournament, as well winning the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship on 24 January 2010 before vacating them on December of that year. On 3 February 2013, Akebono teamed with Daisuke Sekimoto to win the vacant championship by defeating Kohei Sato and Zeus.

=== Return to AJPW (2008–2015) ===
Akebono returned to AJPW, allying himself with Ryota Hama. On 23 September 2009, Akebono and Hama, known collectively as S.M.O.P. (Super Megaton Ohzumo Powers), won the All Asia Tag Team Championship, defeating Minoru Suzuki and Nosawa Rongai. S.M.O.P. also participated in the 2009 World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League, finishing 5th out of 9 teams with four victories and four defeats. S.M.O.P. would only defend the title once before losing them 7 months later to Voodoo-Murders members Big Daddy Voodoo and TARU. After that, Akebono split with Hama and became the enforcer for the group Partisan Forces (Minoru Suzuki, Masakatsu Funaki and Taiyo Kea) to continue his feud with the Voodoo-Murders. Partisan Forces broke up in June 2011, so Akebono reformed S.M.O.P. with Hama. After having an unsuccessful shot at KENSO and The Great Muta for the vacant World Tag Team Championship, Akebono and Hama entered a short feud with Big Daddy and Mazada, whom they defeated on several occasions, and also competed in the 2011 Real World Tag League, receiving two more chances for the All Asia Tag Team Championship against Daisuke Sekimoto and Yuji Okabayashi, lost both times. S.M.O.P. finally regained the All Asia title by defeating Sekimoto and Okabayashi on 1 July 2012, but vacated them on 4 September 2012, due to Akebono being sidelined with pneumonia. In November 2012, Akebono debuted his masked alter ego &quot;Brazo de Bono&quot;, based on Brazo de Plata. On 1 September 2013, Akebono signed a contract with All Japan, officially ending his freelancing days. On 11 September, Akebono entered the 2013 Ōdō Tournament and, in his first match under an All Japan contract, defeated former Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion Jun Akiyama, unveiling his new finishing maneuver, &quot;Yokozuna Impact&quot;, in the process. After wins over Low Ki and Bambi Killer, Akebono reached the finals, where, on 23 September, he defeated Go Shiozaki to win the tournament. On 27 October, Akebono defeated Suwama to win the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship for the first time. Akebono made his first successful title defense on 24 November against Joe Doering. His second successful defense took place on 3 January 2014, against Takao Omori. On 23 February, Akebono made his third successful title defense against Go Shiozaki. Akebono&#x27;s fourth title defense took place on 18 March, when he defeated Kento Miyahara. In April, Akebono looked to enter a rare group of men who have won the Champion Carnival, while holding the Triple Crown Championship, but on 22 April, after securing the top spot in his block, Akebono was forced to pull out of the tournament and forfeit his two remaining matches, after being hospitalized with poor health. On 30 May, Akebono officially relinquished the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship due to his health issues. On 27 July, it was announced that Akebono had been appointed to All Japan&#x27;s board of directors. Akebono wrestled his return match on 16 August. On 30 August, Akebono received his rematch for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion, Joe Doering.

On 22 March 2015, Akebono won the World Tag Team Championship for the second time, when he and Yutaka Yoshie defeated Jun Akiyama and Takao Omori. On 25 April, Akebono defeated Suwama in the finals to win All Japan&#x27;s premier tournament, the Champion Carnival. In the build-up to Akebono&#x27;s challenge for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship against Go Shiozaki, he and Yoshie lost the World Tag Team Championship to Shiozaki and Kento Miyahara on 6 May. On 21 May, Akebono defeated Shiozaki to win the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship for the second time. Akebono eventually went on to lose the championship to Jun Akiyama in his third defense on 1 November 2015. The following day, it was announced that Akebono was leaving All Japan and once again becoming a freelancer, looking to return to martial arts. It was also announced that he would continue working for All Japan as a freelancer.

=== Ōdō (2015–2017) ===
On 4 December 2015, Akebono announced he was forming a new company named Ōdō. He would serve as its president with the backing of Motoko Baba, the widow of All Japan founder Giant Baba. On 13 March 2016, Akebono made his debut for AJPW splinter promotion Wrestle-1, reuniting with SMOP partner Ryota Hama. Ōdō held its first event on 20 April in Korakuen Hall. The main event of the show saw Akebono, Ryota Hama and Taiyo Kea defeat Daisuke Sekimoto, Masato Tanaka and Yuji Okabayashi. In early June, Akebono took part in the Lucha Libre World Cup in Mexico. On 16 September, Ōdō formed a partnership with Pro Wrestling Zero1.

Akebono&#x27;s last recorded match happened on 11 April 2017, for Dramatic Dream Team, where he teamed with Yasu Urano and Harashima and lost to fellow former Triple Crown champion Yoshihiro Takayama and his team with Yuto Aijima and Shigehiro Irie. Following Akebono&#x27;s heart disability in April 2017 (below), and Motoko Baba&#x27;s death on 14 April 2018, Ōdō became an inactive promotion.

== Personal life ==

Akebono was born to Randy, a taxi driver of Irish and Native Hawaiian descent and Janice, an office worker of Cuban and Native Hawaiian descent. He became a Japanese citizen in 1996, giving up his American citizenship and changing his legal name from Chad Rowan to Akebono Tarō, saying &quot;Changing my nationality has nothing to do with who I am, just like I am still my mother&#x27;s son even after I became a Japanese [citizen].&quot;

At the end of 1996, he was engaged to Yu Aihara, a television &quot;tarento&quot;, but broke it off the following year. In February 1998, Akebono announced his engagement to Christiane Reiko Kalina, a teacher who is of Japanese and American descent. They married in September 1998 and have two sons and a daughter.

In April 2017, he was hospitalized after feeling unwell while on a wrestling tour in Kitakyushu. Early reports indicated that he had been placed in a medically-induced coma after suffering a cardiac condition, but his family later released a statement on Akebono&#x27;s website criticizing &quot;misleading&quot; articles and saying he was undergoing treatment &quot;due to a right leg cellulitis and an infection.&quot; A family spokesperson thanked Akebono&#x27;s fans for their support, saying &quot;The number of messages from around the world has been overwhelming.&quot;

The &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; reported that the original story was correct and the cellulitis claim was a cover story for a serious heart issue. Akebono&#x27;s wife confirmed in March 2018 that her husband had suffered acute heart failure and had been in a medically induced coma for two weeks. He lost nearly 130 pounds, much of it in muscle, and still could not walk, requiring a wheelchair. He was to begin intensive physical therapy.

On 2 January 2019, it was reported that he had lost the use of his legs and suffered from partial memory loss, unable to remember his pro-wrestling days. For a short period, he was unable to speak without the aid of his wife.

Although still unable to walk, he attended a memorial service for his former &quot;tsukebito&quot; Ushiomaru at Azumazeki stable in December 2019.

Akebono died of heart failure in April 2024 at age 54 after being admitted to a hospital in Tokyo. His death was announced on the morning of April 11 in Japan, and a funeral was held in Tokyo three days later. Akebono&#x27;s widow Christiane Reiko told reporters after the funeral that he had suffered from arrhythmia for seven years. She also said that Akebono&#x27;s body would be cremated, with half of his ashes remaining with his family in Japan and the other half placed into the ocean off of the Hawaiian coast.

<text>Rolls-Royce Holdings plc is a British multinational aerospace and defence company incorporated in February 2011. The company owns Rolls-Royce, a business established in 1904 which today designs, manufactures and distributes power systems for aviation and other industries. Rolls-Royce is the world&#x27;s second-largest maker of aircraft engines (after CFM International) and has major businesses in the marine propulsion and energy sectors.

Rolls-Royce was the world&#x27;s 16th largest defence contractor in 2018 when measured by defence revenues. The company is also the world&#x27;s fourth largest commercial aircraft engine manufacturer, with a 12% market share .

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. At the close of London trading on 11 February 2025, the company had a market capitalisation of £52.66bn, the 11th-largest of any company with a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange.

The company&#x27;s registered office is at Kings Place, near Kings Cross in London.

==History==
===Ownership===
Rolls-Royce grew from the engineering business of Henry Royce, which was established in 1884 and ten years later began to manufacture dynamos and electric cranes. Charles Rolls established a separate business with Royce in 1904 because Royce had developed a range of cars which Rolls wanted to sell. A corporate owner was incorporated in 1906 with the name Rolls-Royce Limited.

In 1971 the same company, Rolls-Royce Limited, entered voluntary liquidation because it was unable to meet its financial obligations. It remains in existence today, still in liquidation. Its business and assets were bought by the government using a company created for the purpose named Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited. Rolls-Royce Motors was separated out in 1973. Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited currently carries on the business under the name Rolls-Royce plc.

Rolls-Royce plc returned to the stock market in 1987 under the government of Margaret Thatcher. In 2003 ownership of Rolls-Royce plc was passed to Rolls-Royce Group plc. In the same way, Rolls-Royce Group plc passed ownership on 23 May 2011 to Rolls-Royce Holdings plc. Throughout these corporate changes Rolls-Royce plc has remained the principal trading company.

===Growth===
The 1980s saw the introduction of a policy to offer an engine fitment on a much wider range of civil aircraft types, with the company&#x27;s engines now powering 17 different airliners (and their variants) compared to General Electric&#x27;s 14 and Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s 10.

The civil engines business represents the company&#x27;s main area of growth. Between 2010 and 2018, Rolls-Royce invested £11 billion in facilities and R&amp;D and launched six new civil engines including the Trent XWB and the Pearl 15 for the business aviation market. It secured orders for 2,700 engines for wide-body aircraft and business jets. It expects to produce over 600 wide-body engines a year and should power over half of the world&#x27;s wide-body fleet within a few years, up from 22% a decade before.

In 2023, Rolls-Royce entered into an agreement for $3.52 million of funding with the UK Space Agency for the creation of a nuclear reactor on the moon. The project is intended to provide power for space missions.

===Restructuring===
In 2014 and 2015, Rolls-Royce issued at least four profit warnings due to US defence cuts, a downturn in the offshore oil and gas market and its civil aerospace business, the company initiated job cuts of over 3,000 in response. Rolls-Royce had been selling many of its aero-engines in combination with long-term service contracts. Even though the company booked profits in part with the delivery of the engine, actual payments only came in over time. Between 2003 and 2015, it sold a majority of its engines with these “TotalCare” contracts. The company announced it would no longer be able to move its revenues forward from its long-term service contracts to compensate for its contracts being unprofitable in the early stages after the introduction of IFRS 15 in 2018 and its profits for 2015 would have been £900m lower than the £1.4bn it reported if it had followed the new accounting standard.

In February 2017 Rolls-Royce posted its largest ever pre-tax loss of £4.6 billion; This included a £4.4 billion writedown on financial hedges that the company uses to protect itself against currency fluctuations, and a £671 million penalty to settle bribery and corruption charges with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the US Department of Justice, and Brazilian authorities.

On 14 June 2018 the company announced a restructuring of the business to create three simpler decentralised units (civil aerospace, defence and power systems), to rationalise back office functions and to remove middle management functions. The cost savings should amount to £400 million per year by 2020, with an up-front restructuring cost of £500 million. Some 4,600 people are likely to leave the business out of 55,000 employed worldwide, 3,000 job losses from the UK and the rest from elsewhere in the world (15,700 of the employees work in Derby and 10,300 work elsewhere in the United Kingdom).

In August 2018 Rolls-Royce announced it was taking a charge of £554 million to cover faults with some Trent 1000 engines on Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Rather than going thousands of hours between inspections, the faults with turbine blades mean the engines currently require inspection every 300 hours of flight. In the same announcement Rolls-Royce said it would spend £450m fixing faults on the Trent 1000 in 2018, £450m in 2019 and £350m in 2020, with the work complete by 2022.

In May 2020, the company announced its intention to cut 20% of its workforce (approximately 9,000 staff) worldwide as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Around 3,000 job losses were expected in the UK, half of them in Derby.

In February 2021, Rolls-Royce started talks concerning an operational shutdown of its civil aerospace unit that might last for two weeks due to the impact of Covid-19 and its restrictions.

Rolls-Royce announced, in October 2023, that it would cut 2,500 jobs, or 6 per cent of its total workforce.

== Facilities ==
=== Testing ===
Rolls-Royce&#x27;s £90 million test bed 80 is the largest of its kind, sized for engines of up to of thrust. Design started in 2017, construction began in 2018 and it should be commissioned by mid-2020. The facility is long, has a tall intake tower and a tall exhaust stack. Built from 3,450 tons of steel and of concrete, it has a tall and wide enclosed space and it can handle a 66 tons engine including its carrier. The company completed its first engine run on the new test bed in July 2024.

X-ray imaging allows to visualize the position of seals and clearances in real time while an engine is running. While it was retrofitted on Rolls&#x27; test bed 57, test bed 80 is the first to be purpose-designed for industrial radiography. To protect from external X-ray, 30 cm (11.8 in.) of lead, double walls are up to 8.9 ft. (2.7 m) thick (a 5.6-ft. interior wall and 3.3-ft. exterior wall) and provide acoustic insulation. Canadian prime contractor MDS Aero Support is responsible for design and management, test systems supply, engine adapters, support systems and data acquisition and control while construction is done by Buckingham Group Contracting.

==Acquisitions==
;Northern Engineering Industries / broken up and sold
In 1988, Rolls-Royce acquired Northern Engineering Industries (NEI), based in the North East of England, a group of heavy engineering companies mainly associated with electrical generation and power management. The group included Clarke Chapman (cranes), Reyrolle (now part of Siemens) and Parsons (now part of Siemens steam turbines). The company was renamed Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group. It was sold off piecemeal over the next decade as the company re-focused on its core aero-engine operations following the recession of the early 1990s.

;Allison Engine Company/Rolls-Royce Corporation
On 21 November 1994, Rolls-Royce announced its intention to acquire the Allison Engine Company, an American manufacturer of gas turbines and components for aviation, industrial and marine engines. The two companies had a technical association dating back to the Second World War. Rolls-Royce had previously tried to buy the company when General Motors sold it in 1993, but GM opted for a management buyout instead for $370 million. Owing to Allison&#x27;s involvement in classified and export restricted technology, the 1994 acquisition was subject to investigation to determine the national security implications. On 27 March 1995, the US Department of Defense announced that the &quot;deal between Allison Engine Co. and Rolls-Royce does not endanger national security.&quot; Rolls-Royce was, however, obliged to set up a proxy board to manage Allison and had also to set up a separate company, Allison Advanced Development Company, Inc., to manage classified programmes &quot;that involve leading-edge technologies&quot; such as the Joint Strike Fighter programme. In 2000, this restriction was replaced by a more flexible Special Security Arrangement. In 2001, Rolls-Royce and its LiftSystem was among the group that won the JSF contract for the F-35.

The Allison acquisition, at $525 million (equivalent to £328 million), brought four new engine types into the Rolls-Royce civil engine portfolio on seven platforms and several light aircraft applications. Allison is now known as Rolls-Royce Corporation, part of Rolls-Royce North America.

;Vickers/Vinters
In 1999 Rolls-Royce acquired Vickers plc for its marine businesses. The portion retained is now Vinters Engineering Limited. Rolls-Royce sold Vickers Defence Systems (the other major Vickers area of business) to Alvis plc in 2002.

;BMW joint venture / Rolls-Royce Deutschland
Rolls-Royce has established a leading position in the corporate and regional airline sector through the development of the Tay engine, the Allison acquisition and the consolidation of the BMW Rolls-Royce joint venture. In 1999, BMW Rolls-Royce was renamed Rolls-Royce Deutschland and became a 100% owned subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc.

;SAIC joint venture / Optimized Systems and Solutions
Optimized Systems and Solutions Limited (formerly known as Data Systems &amp; Solutions) was founded in 1999 as a joint venture between Rolls-Royce plc and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). In early 2006, SAIC exited the joint venture agreement, making Rolls-Royce plc the sole owner.

;Tognum joint venture with Daimler / Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH
In March 2011, Rolls-Royce and Daimler AG launched a $4.2 billion public tender offer for 100 per cent of the share capital of Tognum AG, the owner of MTU Friedrichshafen – a leading high-speed industrial and marine diesel engine manufacturer, which was completed using a 50:50 joint venture company. Rolls-Royce and Daimler AG intend that the joint venture company, which also now incorporates Rolls-Royce&#x27;s existing Bergen engine business, is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

;Aero Engine Controls / Rolls-Royce Controls and Data Services
Following the acquisition of Goodrich by United Technologies Corporation in July 2012, Rolls-Royce announced it would purchase Goodrich&#x27;s 50% share of Aero Engine Controls to become wholly owned by Rolls-Royce.

At the June 2019 Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce announced its acquisition of Siemens&#x27; electric propulsion branch (while they are partners on the E-Fan X demonstrator), to be completed in late 2019, employing 180 in Germany and Hungary.

==Divestment==
===Energy gas turbine and compressor business===
In May 2014, Rolls-Royce sold its energy gas turbine and compressor business to Siemens for £785 million.

=== Commercial marine business ===
In July 2018, Rolls-Royce sold its commercial marine business to Kongsberg for £500 million.

===Nuclear services businesses===
In September 2019, Rolls-Royce agreed to sell its civil nuclear services businesses in the U.S., Canada, Mondragon France, and Gateshead UK to the Westinghouse Electric Company for an undisclosed sum. These businesses had a revenue of $70 million and about 500 employees in 2018. Rolls-Royce is keeping its nuclear new build and small modular reactor (SMR) business in the UK. In November 2020, the company announced plans to build up to 16 Rolls-Royce SMR nuclear plants across the UK, continuing its nuclear division operations. In December 2020 Rolls-Royce announced it would sell other foreign parts of its civil nuclear instrumentation and control business to Framatome as part of its post-COVID recovery plan, completing the deal involving over 550 employees in November 2021.

==Major sales==

;Airbus A380
In 1996, Rolls-Royce and Airbus signed a memorandum of understanding, specifying the Trent 900 as the engine of choice for the then A3XX, now the Airbus A380. However, the Engine Alliance GP7000 would ultimately also be offered as an option on the A380. 

In October 2006, Rolls-Royce suspended production of its Trent 900 engine because of delays by Airbus on the delivery of the A380 superjumbo. Rolls-Royce announced in October 2007 that production of the Trent 900 had been restarted after a twelve-month suspension caused by delays to the A380.

In 2011, Rolls-Royce faced scrutiny after high profile incidents involving the Trent 900. One of the engines suffered a partial power loss during a Qantas flight in February 2011. This followed an incident in November 2010 in which an engine disintegrated in flight causing Qantas Flight 32 to make an emergency landing in Singapore. The aircraft was extensively damaged and the airline grounded its fleet of A380s. The problem was traced to a fatigue crack in an oil pipe requiring the replacement of some engines and modifications to the design. Trent-powered A380s operated by Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines were also affected. Qantas gradually returned its A380s to service over several months. In June 2011 the airline announced it had agreed to compensation of AU$95m (US$100m) from Rolls-Royce.

On 17 April 2015, it was announced that Rolls-Royce had received its largest order to date worth £6.1bn ($9.2bn) to supply engines for 50 Emirates A380 planes.

;Boeing 787
On 6 April 2004, Boeing announced that it had selected both Rolls-Royce and General Electric to power its new 787. Rolls-Royce submitted the Trent 1000, a further development of that series.

;Airbus A350XWB
In July 2006, Rolls-Royce reached an agreement to supply a new version of the Trent 1000 for the revised Airbus A350XWB jetliner. As of July 2015, over 1,500 engines of this type have been supplied to 40 customers.

;Panavia Tornado, Eurofighter Typhoon and Lightning II
On the military side, Rolls-Royce, in co-operation with other European manufacturers, has been a major contractor for the RB199 which in several variants powers the Panavia Tornado, and also for the EJ200 engine for the Eurofighter Typhoon. Rolls-Royce has matured the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem invented by Lockheed Martin for the F-35 Lightning II to production level; The F-35 is planned to be produced in significant numbers.

;Air China
At the 2005 Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce secured in excess of $1 billion worth of orders. The firm received $800m worth of orders from Air China to supply its 20 Airbus A330 jets.

;Qatar Airways
On 18 June 2007, Rolls-Royce announced at the 2007 Paris Air Show that it had signed a large contract with Qatar Airways for the Trent XWB to power 80 A350s on order from Airbus worth $5.6 billion at list prices. 

;Emirates airlines
On 11 November 2007, Rolls-Royce announced at the Dubai Airshow that it had signed its largest ever contract with Emirates for Trent XWBs to power 50 A350-900 and 20 A350-1000 aircraft with 50 option rights. Due to be delivered from 2014, the order is potentially worth up to 8.4 billion US Dollars at list prices.

On 20 November 2007, Rolls-Royce announced plans to build its first Asian aero engine facility in the Seletar Aerospace Park, Singapore. The $562m (£355m) plant complements its existing facility at Derby by concentrating on the assembly and testing of large civil engines, including Trent 1000 and Trent XWB. Productivity will be higher than at Derby, as the plant is fully integrated, as opposed to manufacturing occurring across five sites in the UK: a Trent 900 will take only 14 days to manufacture, as opposed to 20 in the UK. Originally expected to provide employment for 330 people, by the start of production in 2012, 1,600 employees were based in Singapore.

;Nuclear submarines
In May 2012, Rolls-Royce Marine Power Operations won a Ministry of Defence contract worth more than £400 million for the integration of the reactor design, the PWR3, for UK&#x27;s next generation nuclear-armed submarines. In March 2023, Rolls-Royce announced that Rolls-Royce Submarines Limited will provide nuclear reactors for the SSN-AUKUS class of submarines for both the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy. To support the SSN-AUKUS programme, Rolls-Royce announced it would double the size of the Rolls-Royce Submarines LTD site in Raynesway, Derby creating 1,170 jobs in the process

==Corruption allegations==

Rolls-Royce has been accused numerous times of corrupt practices and bribery.

In 2014, facing allegations of bribery in the aftermath of the Sudhir Choudhrie affair, Rolls-Royce offered to return money to the Indian government. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) also investigated allegations of bribery in Indonesia and China.

In February 2015 Rolls-Royce was accused of bribing an employee of Brazil&#x27;s state-controlled oil company to win a $100 million contract to provide gas turbines for oil platforms.

In October 2016 a joint &quot;Guardian&quot; and BBC investigation alleged widespread corruption by Rolls-Royce through middlemen in foreign countries including Brazil, India, China, Indonesia, South Africa, Angola, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. Rolls-Royce became subject to a major SFO investigation.

===Alleged defects===
In 2013 media reported allegations from two American ex-employees that thousands of the company&#x27;s new jet engines were assembled with used parts.

===Settlement with SFO===
In January 2017 Rolls-Royce came to an agreement with the SFO to pay £671 million under a deferred prosecution agreement to avoid prosecution for bribery to obtain export contracts. As part of this agreement, a $170 million fine was paid to US authorities to end a bribery investigation, and $25 million to the Brazilian authorities.

Subsequent to the settlement, &quot;Private Eye&quot; reported that some of Rolls-Royce&#x27;s contracts under the scope of the SFO investigation had been supported by the British government&#x27;s UK Export Finance department, using taxpayers&#x27; money. The government department underwrote multimillion-pound liabilities under Rolls-Royce contracts secured with the help of bribes and &quot;facilitation&quot; commissions. It has also been highlighted in the press that Rolls-Royce&#x27;s auditor since 1995, KPMG, had failed to identify any corrupt practices throughout the 1990s and 2000s. This is notable considering judge Brian Leveson&#x27;s statement that Rolls-Royce&#x27;s offending was &quot;multi-jurisdictional, numerous&quot;, &quot;persistent and spanned from 1989 until 2013&quot;, and it &quot;involved substantial funds being made available to fund bribe payments&quot;.

<text>The Association of Little Presses (ALP) was an organisation dedicated to promoting small press publishing activity in Britain and Ireland.

==History==
ALP was founded at a meeting held at Arlington Mill, Bibury, Gloucestershire, on 23 July 1966. The meeting had been called by Bob Cobbing of Writers Forum and Stuart Montgomery of Fulcrum Press and was attended by representatives of a number of other small press publishers.

Over the years, ALP published a regular newsletter, &quot;Poetry and Little Press Information&quot; (&quot;PALPI&quot;). This featured listings of publications by member presses as well as information on printers, suppliers and bookshops likely to be of interest. The association also ran regular bookfairs at which members could sell their books and published an annual catalogue of publications that was available to the public, libraries and academic institutions.

By the late 1990s, ALP was coming under pressure from the growth of new publishing methods and technologies, and the last known catalogue appeared in 1997.

<text>Oberschule am Elsengrund was a school in Mahlsdorf in Berlin, Germany. The school was founded in 1983 as a school for Polytechnique. After the reunification of Germany it became a comprehensive school. This school moved away in summer 1993 and in August of the same year it became a gymnasium (school) which is not existing anymore. It had about 750 students taught by around 50 teachers.

Foreign languages taught were English, French, Latin and Spanish.

<text>Daniel Gray Quillen (June 22, 1940 – April 30, 2011) was an American mathematician. He is known for being the &quot;prime architect&quot; of higher algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory, for which he was awarded the Cole Prize in 1975 and the Fields Medal in 1978.

From 1984 to 2006, he was the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at Magdalen College, Oxford.

==Education and career==
Quillen was born in Orange, New Jersey, and attended Newark Academy. He entered Harvard University, where he earned both his AB, in 1961, and his PhD in 1964; the latter completed under the supervision of Raoul Bott, with a thesis in partial differential equations. He was a Putnam Fellow in 1959.

Quillen obtained a position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after completing his doctorate. He also spent a number of years at several other universities. He visited France twice: first as a Sloan Fellow in Paris, during the academic year 1968–69, where he was greatly influenced by Grothendieck, and then, during 1973–74, as a Guggenheim Fellow. In 1969–70, he was a visiting member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he came under the influence of Michael Atiyah.

In 1978, Quillen received a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Helsinki.

From 1984 to 2006, he was the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at Magdalen College, Oxford.

Quillen retired at the end of 2006. He died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on April 30,
2011, aged 70, in Florida.

==Mathematical contributions==
Quillen&#x27;s best known contribution (mentioned specifically in his Fields medal citation) was his formulation of higher algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory in 1972. This new tool, formulated in terms of homotopy theory, proved to be successful in formulating and solving problems in algebra, particularly in ring theory and module theory. More generally, Quillen developed tools (especially his theory of model categories) that allowed algebro-topological tools to be applied in other contexts.

Before his work in defining higher algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory, Quillen worked on the Adams conjecture, formulated by Frank Adams, in homotopy theory. His proof of the conjecture used techniques from the modular representation theory of groups, which he later applied to work on cohomology of groups and algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory. He also worked on complex cobordism, showing that its formal group law is essentially the universal one.

In related work, he also supplied a proof of Serre&#x27;s conjecture about the triviality of algebraic vector bundles on affine space, which led to the Bass–Quillen conjecture. He was also an architect (along with Dennis Sullivan) of rational homotopy theory.

He introduced the Quillen determinant line bundle and the Mathai–Quillen formalism.

<doc id="435528" wikidata="Q859895" url="?curid=435528" title="Lucas Mangope">
<text>Kgosi Lucas Manyane Mangope (27 December 1923 – 18 January 2018) was the leader of the Bantustan (homeland) of Bophuthatswana. The territory he ruled over was distributed between the Orange Free State – what is now Free State – and North West Province. He was also the founder and leader of the United Christian Democratic Party, a political party based in the North West of South Africa.

==Education==
Mangope attended an Anglican mission school for most of his school career. He matriculated from St. Peter&#x27;s College, Rosetenville in Johannesburg in 1946. After matric, he registered for a Junior Teaching Diploma at the Diocesan Teachers&#x27; Training College in Polokwane (then called Pietersburg). He studied towards a Higher Primary Teacher’s Diploma at Bethel College in the Transvaal from 1951. After graduating he started teaching and specialised as an Afrikaans teacher. He taught at secondary schools in Mahikeng, Motswedi, Krugersdorp and Potchefstroom and was awarded in 1959 when one of his classes obtained the best results in Afrikaans among competing schools in South Africa.

==Career==
When the Tswana Territorial Authority was established in 1961, Mangope became the vice-chairman, working under Chief TR Pilane. He was promoted to the Chief Chancellor of the organisation in 1968. He remained in the position until 1972 when he became the first Chief Minister of Bophuthatswana. He was also accused of spying for foreign powers, misappropriation of state funds, repossession of land from tribal authorities without adequate compensation and discrepancies in appointments and salaries within the Bophuthatswana Defence Force.

He became President in 1977, when Bophuthatswana was declared independent by the South African government. On 10 February 1988 he was briefly overthrown by members of a military police unit, led by Rocky Malebane-Metsing of the People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP), who had accused Mangope of corruption and charged that the recent election had been rigged in the government&#x27;s favour. Mangope was reinstated following intervention by the South African Defence Force. South Africa&#x27;s government stated that it was responding to a request for assistance from the legal government of a sovereign nation.

Sasha Polakow-Suransky (a Jewish-American journalist and author) wrote that Mangope was &quot;widely considered a puppet and a joke in South Africa&quot; during his presidency. Mangope was nevertheless given some recognition during visits to Israel, meeting with prominent figures such as Moshe Dayan. Bophuthatswana had an unofficial &quot;embassy&quot; in Israel in the 1980s despite objections from the Israeli Foreign Ministry, which did not recognize the bantustan as a state.

Mangope was accused of using his defence force and police to suppress protests, and had been accused of police brutality when a student protest was suppressed by his police force. Mangope&#x27;s supporters, however, have argued that Bophuthatswana was comparatively more successful than other Bantustans in social and economic development, owing to its mineral wealth. Although designated as an ethnic Tswana homeland, Bophuthatswana was more or less an integrated society where Apartheid legislation did not apply, in common with other homelands.

===1994 crisis===

At the Kempton Park negotiations in 1993 that led to the first non-racial election in South Africa in 1994, Mangope had made it clear that Bophuthatswana would remain independent of the new and integrated South Africa and that he would not allow the upcoming election to take place in &quot;his country&quot;. With most residents in favour of reintegration, the homeland&#x27;s military mutinied. Mangope called on outside help, but was eventually forced to flee the homeland, and shortly thereafter, the homelands were reincorporated into South Africa.

===After Bophuthatswana===
Pik Botha, South Africa’s Foreign Minister at the time, and member of the Transitional Executive Council Mac Maharaj removed Mangope from office in March 1994.

After the transition to nonracial democracy, Mangope remained active in politics, forming the United Christian Democratic Party in 1997. Party support was confined to the North West Province (which contained most of Bophuthatswana), and at its peak it held three seats out of 400 in the National Assembly. His party argued that under the Xhosa-led ANC, their quality of life in the province would deteriorate and that conditions were improved because Tswana people ruled themselves. Mangope led the party for fifteen years, but was expelled from the party in 2012. He had been accused of being autocratic, but failed to attend his disciplinary hearing, and had his membership terminated. In the runup to the following election, in 2014, many of the party&#x27;s members, encouraged by Mangope, left to join the Democratic Alliance. The party subsequently lost all of its seats including those in the provincial parliament and provincial legislature.

==Beliefs==
Speaking to the &quot;Financial Mail&quot; in June 1980, Mangope professed his belief in capitalist free enterprise, saying it would lead to &quot;true freedom and prosperity for our people&quot; if it is &quot;regulated by a strong sense of social responsibility&quot;. He lamented the fact that capitalism had failed to make itself more appealing in Africa and failed to defend itself against the attacks of Marxism. According to Mangope, free enterprise has led to more material prosperity in African nations that have adopted it. He concluded:&quot;I believe that free enterprise, at its best, encourages not only individuals, but whole communities and societies to aspire upwards.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
A statue of Mangope was erected outside the Bahurutshe Boo Manyane tribal office in the North West’s Motswedi (his place of birth) to honour him. Mangope died at his home in Motswedi, Lehurutshe on 18 January 2018, aged 94. Following his death, officials from the organisation expressed wishes to establish the statue as a tourist attraction since it was the last one standing of the late former president.
In 2012, a street named after Mangope in North West Province was renamed to honor Molefe Makinta instead; another street named after his wife Leah was also renamed.

In 2020, it was reported that the infrastructure that the Mangope administration built worth over R1 billion was abandoned by the current administration.

==Family==
Mangope was initially married to a woman named Leah, and they had seven children. Leah survived a car accident involving a donkey in the mid-1980s. Soon after, her husband ordered the mass slaughter of donkeys by police. The killing of the animals continued for seven years. Mangope justified it with the argument that donkeys were dangerous and had become a hazard on the roads. Other sources say it was Mangope himself who nearly collided with a donkey. However, the decision to cull donkeys was more likely due to the drought that was ongoing at the time. Leah eventually died on 23 July 2003. Mangope remarried in May 2007 to Violet Mongale, a senior nurse. 

His son Kwena Mangope is currently the North West Province Provincial Chairperson for Action SA.

<doc id="435531" wikidata="Q223736" url="?curid=435531" title="Velvet Revolver">
<text>Velvet Revolver was an American hard rock supergroup consisting of Guns N&#x27; Roses members Slash (lead guitar), Duff McKagan (bass, backing vocals) and Matt Sorum (drums, backing vocals), alongside Dave Kushner (rhythm guitar) formerly of punk band Wasted Youth, and Scott Weiland (lead vocalist) formerly of Stone Temple Pilots. The band formed in 2002 and was active until 2008, when Weiland was fired from the band and subsequently rejoined Stone Temple Pilots.

In 2004, the band achieved commercial success with their debut album, &quot;Contraband&quot;. Despite positive reviews, some critics initially described Velvet Revolver as a mere combination of Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N&#x27; Roses, and criticized them for a &quot;disconnection&quot; between Weiland and the rest of the band. With their single &quot;Slither&quot;, they won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. The band released &quot;Libertad&quot; in 2007, driven by the release of the single &quot;She Builds Quick Machines&quot;, and embarked on a tour with Alice in Chains.

In April 2008, Weiland was fired from Velvet Revolver and reunited with Stone Temple Pilots. Velvet Revolver was put on indefinite hiatus and in November of that year, requested to be released by their record label RCA Records to allow themselves &quot;complete freedom to go through whatever process it would take to accomplish&quot; replacing Weiland.

Although Velvet Revolver worked on new material and auditioned new singers following Scott Weiland&#x27;s departure, the band has not released any new material and only performed publicly once since 2008, when they reunited with Weiland for a one-off reunion show on January 12, 2012, at a benefit concert. This proved to be their last performance together before Weiland&#x27;s death on December 3, 2015. Slash and McKagan rejoined Guns N&#x27; Roses in 2016.

==History==

===Foundations (2001–2002)===
Slash, Duff McKagan, and Matt Sorum were members of the hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses. However, disagreements with singer Axl Rose resulted in Slash leaving the band in 1996 and McKagan departing in 1997 shortly before Sorum was fired. Following their departures the trio focused on separate projects, with Slash reforming Slash&#x27;s Snakepit and McKagan reforming 10 Minute Warning as well as recording his second solo album, while Sorum rejoined the Cult.

By 2001, Slash&#x27;s Snakepit had disbanded for the second time. Slash began working with the Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman and an unnamed bassist on a new project: writing the music for what would become &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;. McKagan reformed Loaded, previously his band for the tour in support of &quot;Beautiful Disease&quot;, with Geoff Reading. McKagan also added both Mike Squires and Jeff Rouse to the lineup. Following a tour of Japan in 2002, former Zilch, Wasted Youth, Electric Love Hogs, and Dave Navarro guitarist Dave Kushner joined Loaded in place of Mike Squires.

===Formation (2002–2003)===
When musician Randy Castillo died from cancer in 2002, Slash, McKagan, and Sorum performed at a benefit concert to raise money and commemorate Castillo, with Josh Todd and Keith Nelson of Buckcherry as well as B-Real and Sen Dog of Cypress Hill. Recognizing that their musical relationship was still intact, the trio began rehearsing with Todd and Nelson, working on material that would become &quot;Dirty Little Thing&quot;, but eventually decided against forming a group with them. During a Loaded show at West Hollywood&#x27;s Viper Room, McKagan re-introduced Dave Kushner to Slash, who were previously friends in junior high and high school. Kushner was invited to jam with the group and was soon invited to join with Slash, stating that &quot;Dave brought a cool vibe to what [they] were doing. There was no deliberation; that was it, it was a perfect fit.&quot; Their former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate Izzy Stradlin also joined them for two weeks, eventually suggesting that &quot;Duff and [Stradlin] will sing and [they] will just do a club tour in a van.&quot; Slash states in his autobiography that it was hard to tell if Stradlin was serious or kidding. After auditioning Kelly Shaefer of Atheist and Neurotica, Stradlin left the group.
While Shaefer&#x27;s audition was unsuccessful, the quartet continued auditioning for a lead singer. VH1 filmed the recruitment process, which was referred to as the temporary name &quot;The Project&quot;. The resulting documentary was aired as &quot;VH1 Inside Out: The Rise of Velvet Revolver&quot;. A number of lead singers auditioned for the band, including Stephen Shareaux of Kik Tracee, Steve Ludwin of Carrie and Little Hell, Todd Kerns, formerly of Age of Electric,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerns/Albro&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sebastian Bach, formerly of Skid Row, Shawn Albro of U.P.O., Travis Meeks of Days of the New, and Ian Thornley of Big Wreck. Myles Kennedy, formerly of the Mayfield Four, declined an invitation from Sorum to audition. Ian Astbury of the Cult and Mike Patton of Faith No More also declined audition offers. The band were also interested in auditioning Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland, who had become friends with McKagan after attending the same gym. Weiland once played on the same bill as Kushner, and was in rehab at the same time as Sorum. Weiland was sent two discs of material, and felt that the first disc &quot;sounded like Bad Company gone wrong.&quot; When he was sent the second disc, Weiland was more positive, comparing it to &quot;Core&quot;-era Stone Temple Pilots, though he turned them down because Stone Temple Pilots were still together.
When Stone Temple Pilots disbanded in 2003, the band sent Weiland new music, which he took into his studio and added vocals. This music eventually became the song &quot;Set Me Free&quot;. Weiland was still unsure whether or not he wanted to join, despite delivering the music to the band himself and performing at an industry showcase at Mates. They recorded two songs with producer Nick Raskulinecz, a recorded version of &quot;Set Me Free&quot; and a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot;, for the soundtracks to the movies &quot;Hulk&quot; and &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, respectively. Weiland joined the band soon after. &quot;Set Me Free&quot; managed to peak at number 17 on the Mainstream Rock Chart without any radio promotion or a record label.

It was prior to a screening of &quot;The Hulk&quot; at Universal Studios that the band chose a name. After seeing a movie by Revolution Studios, Slash liked the beginning of the word, eventually thinking of Revolver because of its multiple meanings; the name of a gun, subtext of a revolving door which suited the band as well as the name of a Beatles album. When he suggested Revolver to the band, Weiland suggested back Black Velvet Revolver, liking the idea of &quot;something intimate like velvet juxtaposed with something deadly like a gun.&quot; They eventually arrived at Velvet Revolver, announcing it at a press conference and performance showcase at the El Rey Theatre while also performing the songs &quot;Set Me Free&quot; and &quot;Slither&quot; as well as covers of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Negative Creep&quot;, Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Bodies&quot;, and Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot;.

===&quot;Contraband&quot; and mainstream success (2003–2005)===

Prior to the recording of their debut album, Weiland took material that the band had previously written to his studio, Lavish, in Toluca Lake. With engineer Doug Grean, Weiland rearranged the music to fit his vocals, eventually coming out with the songs &quot;Big Machine&quot; and &quot;Dirty Little Thing&quot;. The band worked on new material for songs such as &quot;You Got No Right&quot;, &quot;Slither&quot;, &quot;Sucker Train Blues&quot;, and &quot;Do It for the Kids&quot;, among others. During this time Weiland was arrested at the parking lot of his studio for drug possession. Upon release from jail, he wrote lyrics to material he was given previously, writing the lyrics to the song &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;. Velvet Revolver soon began recording their debut album. Initially, they recorded &quot;Slither&quot; with producer Bob Ezrin at Henson Studios, but were dissatisfied with the result. After recording &quot;Headspace&quot; with Josh Abraham, the band liked the track enough to do the rest of the album with him.
Velvet Revolver soon gained major-label attention with Warner Bros. and Chrysalis. RCA and Elektra were also interested in signing the band. They eventually signed with RCA Records. They recorded their album at NRG Recording Studios, while Slash recorded his guitar parts at a smaller studio on the southern corner between Highland Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. During recording, Weiland could only work for three hours a day due to a court order mandating that he stay in a halfway house. The marketing campaign for Velvet Revolver in the run-up to the release of the first album was profiled as part of the &quot;Frontline&quot; program &quot;The Way the Music Died&quot;, which included interviews with the band members and producers.

The resulting album, titled &quot;Contraband&quot;, was released on June 8, 2004. Helped by the success of the single &quot;Slither&quot;, it debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 250,000 copies in the first week. &quot;Contraband&quot; went on to sell four million copies worldwide, 2.9 million of which were sold in the United States, and was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA. Both &quot;Slither&quot; and &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; peaked at number one on the Mainstream Rock Chart as well as number 56 and 67 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. &quot;Slither&quot; also peaked at number one on the Modern Rock Chart and number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Dirty Little Thing&quot;, peaked at number eight on the Mainstream Rock chart.

Critically, the album was generally well received. Despite being praised for its hedonism and maturity, critics noted a disconnection between &quot;singer and band&quot;. Velvet Revolver won the Kerrang! Award for Best International Newcomer in 2004, and the following year they won the Best Hard Rock Performance Grammy Award for &quot;Slither&quot;. They were also nominated for Rock Artist of the Year at the Billboard Music Awards while &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; was nominated for a Song of the Year/Rock Radio Radio Music Award. They recorded a new song entitled &quot;Come On, Come In&quot; for the movie &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; in 2005, which peaked at number 14 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; then re-entered the charts, peaking at number twenty-five on the Adult Top 40 the same year.

Velvet Revolver toured extensively for nineteen months in support of &quot;Contraband&quot;. They toured both the United States and Europe twice, while also performing in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. They performed at Live 8 and various festivals including Download Festival, as well as Ozzfest. During the tour, the band members, with the exception of Kushner, began to relapse on alcohol and drugs. Though they got clean in time for the recording of their new album, Slash felt that &quot;[the band] lost [Weiland]&quot; and &quot;thought the overall spirit of everything was declining at that point.&quot;

===&quot;Libertad&quot; and departure of Scott Weiland (2005–2008)===

Weiland announced in 2005 that Velvet Revolver&#x27;s next album would be titled &quot;Libertad&quot; and would be a concept album. When they started writing material, they decided against the concept idea. Initially, the band started working with producer Rick Rubin on the album. However, due to his methods, such as having a crew to do the work and engineering while only popping in occasionally, and because he was also working with other bands at the same time, they decided against continuing with Rubin. At the suggestion of Weiland, Velvet Revolver began working with Brendan O&#x27;Brien. Slash stated that O&#x27; Brien &quot;brought more than just discipline to the equation, he brought a musicality that stems from the fact that he plays guitar, bass and drums. At any given moment he could play along [with the band] and it really helped the process.&quot; While writing for the album, Weiland believed that his bandmates were going to reunite with Guns N&#x27; Roses when the band&#x27;s manager was talking to Axl Rose about switching management companies, and were not going to record their second album. He was later convinced by the band that this was not the case.
Following the completion of the album, Velvet Revolver performed for and inducted Van Halen into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Weiland and Slash speaking on the band&#x27;s behalf, on March 12, 2007. The band played a medley of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout Love&quot; and &quot;Runaround&quot;. Shows in South America with Aerosmith followed in April. They released the EP &quot;Melody and the Tyranny&quot; on June 1 to serve as a precursor to the release of their new album, which featured two songs from &quot;Libertad&quot;, a cover of Talking Heads song &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; and a video documentary about the making of &quot;Libertad&quot; as well as a live video of the band performing &quot;Do It for the Kids&quot;.

&quot;Libertad&quot; was released on July 3, 2007, peaking at number five on the Billboard 200. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;She Builds Quick Machines&quot;, peaked at 74 on the Hot Canadian Digital Singles. The second and third singles, &quot;The Last Fight&quot; and &quot;Get Out the Door&quot;, both peaked at number 16 and 34 on the Mainstream Rock Chart, respectively. Critical reception to the album was mixed. Though some critics praised the album and felt that &quot;Libertad&quot; gave the band an identity of their own, outside of the Guns N&#x27; Roses and Stone Temple Pilots comparisons, others described the album as &quot;bland&quot; and noted that the band had yet to gel with them &quot;play[ing] to their strengths instead of finding a collective sound.&quot;

In support of &quot;Libertad&quot;, Velvet Revolver toured North America with Alice in Chains from August to October 2007. They also performed at the Virgin Festival, Gods of Metal, and Download in 2007. A November tour of Japan was canceled after they were denied visas, and in 2008, a tour of Australia was postponed, due to health issues, and later canceled following Weiland&#x27;s decision to voluntarily enter a rehab facility. On November 21, 2007, Weiland was arrested after crashing his car while driving on an L.A. highway. He was charged with driving under the influence of drugs with a prior conviction and later released on $40,000 bail. Velvet Revolver then toured both the US and the UK, as well as some European shows, on the Rock n&#x27; Roll as It Should Be tour from January 24 to April 1, 2008. They also played at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival on March 8 the same year. During the tour, Weiland &quot;got back into his old ways&quot;, which started to take their toll on the rest of the band with the cancellation of the Australian tour seen as the &quot;final blow&quot;.

On the UK tour, the band members never spoke with Weiland, with the exception of a few arguments around the stage. Tensions came to a head during Velvet Revolver&#x27;s Glasgow show on March 20, 2008, where Weiland announced to the crowd that it was the band&#x27;s last tour, unaware that the other band members were already planning on firing him. After Sorum posted a message about the show on his website, Weiland issued a statement through Blabbermouth.net in response, saying he &quot;made many attempts to remain cordial with the members of [Velvet Revolver], but mainly, the likes of [Sorum]&quot; and that &quot;[the band] were a gang. But ego and jealousy can get the better of anyone.&quot; Slash later stated that it would not be Velvet Revolver&#x27;s last tour. Weiland&#x27;s departure was announced on April 1. Weiland also departed the cover band Camp Freddy, which also featured Sorum, and reunited with Stone Temple Pilots, before being fired in 2013.

=== Search for a new singer and solo careers (2008–2015) ===

After Weiland&#x27;s departure, the band began recording and searching for a new singer. The search was sporadic with the band spending some time auditioning singers, then turning into solo projects, returning to the band, then abandoning it again. Several names were rumored to be auditioning for the band through the years. Myles Kennedy (Alter Bridge) was strongly rumored due to his collaborations with Slash; Lenny Kravitz, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, Steve Isaacs formerly of Skycycle and the Panic Channel, Royston Langdon of Spacehog, Donovan Leitch of Camp Freddy, Ours singer Jimmy Gnecco and Scars on Broadway guitarist Franky Perez, as well as previous auditionee Sebastian Bach. Ex-Slash&#x27;s Snakepit lead vocalist Rod Jackson was rumoured to audition, but Slash stated that he would not collaborate with Jackson again, citing his poor work ethic and unreliability. Kushner later revealed that Perez was officially hired by the band as vocalist for a brief time in 2008.

Slash, McKagan, and Sorum all contributed to the song &quot;Kissed It&quot; for the Macy Gray album &quot;The Sellout&quot;, which was released on June 22, 2010. Despite not featuring Kushner, the trio were credited as Velvet Revolver on the album. The band released their first concert DVD on November 16, 2010, entitled &quot;Live In Houston&quot;, which was filmed June 18, 2004, at the Verizon Wireless Theater while the band was touring in support of &quot;Contraband&quot;. Slash, McKagan and Sorum made a performance at the Road Recovery benefit concert on September 13 with a guest appearance from Kushner.

Velvet Revolver reunited for a one-off performance with Scott Weiland at a benefit concert for the late John O&#x27;Brien, on January 12, 2012. Following a benefit show for the Road Recovery in 2011 with the other Velvet Revolver members, each one agreed to a one-off reunion before Kushner invited Weiland, who also agreed. Kushner also stated it was then unknown what Velvet Revolver&#x27;s plans were for the future after the reunion show; &quot;I know everyone&#x27;s got other commitments, but I think everyone&#x27;s like, &#x27;Let&#x27;s get this thing done and get through this and then we&#x27;ll see.

In April 2012, Weiland remarked that he would like to reunite permanently with Velvet Revolver, saying that &quot;if Maynard James Keenan can do it with A Perfect Circle and Tool, then there&#x27;s no reason why I shouldn&#x27;t go and do it with both bands&quot;. Further in May in an interview with ABC Radio Weiland said that he had reunited with the band permanently for a tour and an album, which was denied a few days later by Slash in an interview with 93X.

On May 12, 2014, in an interview at the MusiCares benefit concert, Slash told journalist Lucas H. Gordon that he &quot;think[s] [they&#x27;re] gonna audition a singer&quot; in the future. However, he also stated that he would be touring with his solo band &quot;for the next year and a half.&quot;

On June 29, 2014, in an interview to Totalrock radio, Duff McKagan talked to Hayley Leggs in Clisson France about the subject of a new lead vocalist for Velvet Revolver and revealed that there had been at least one audition for the role of lead vocalist, but said that the person that they auditioned did not properly impress the remaining members of the band. He also ruled himself out of being the band&#x27;s lead vocalist.

On December 3, 2015, Weiland was found dead on his tour bus around 9 pm, one day before he was to perform in Minnesota with his band the Wildabouts, which ended the possible reunion. Both Slash and McKagan rejoined Guns N&#x27; Roses in 2016.

==Musical style==
Velvet Revolver&#x27;s first album, &quot;Contraband&quot;, was described by Johnny Loftus of AllMusic as an &quot;updated version of Guns N&#x27; Roses swagger behind Scott Weiland&#x27;s glammy, elastic vocals.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that &quot;[a]nyone expecting &quot;Use Your Illusion III&quot;, though, will be in for a slight buzzkill&quot; and that &quot;[t]he songs suggest the pop grunge of Weiland&#x27;s old band more than the careening overdrive of GN&#x27;R.&quot; A number of reviewers made some comparisons to the members&#x27; previous bands, with PopMatters reviewer David Powell stating that &quot;&quot;Contraband&quot; is a pretty good record of unpretentious rock and roll that suffers from inevitable comparison with the best efforts of its parent bands.&quot; He went on to state that while Velvet Revolver&#x27;s &quot;heritage is evident on most of the songs&quot;, &quot;Contraband&quot; &quot;improves with repeat listening, which is encouraging.&quot; Velvet Revolver&#x27;s second album, &quot;Libertad&quot;, saw the band&#x27;s style change with the presence of producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien, noted by AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine. Erlewine also stated that &quot;too often, there are concessions between Weiland and the others during the course of a song.&quot; Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that &quot;Libertad&quot; &quot;feels both comfortingly familiar and vaguely exotic.&quot; Songs such as &quot;Let it Roll&quot; and &quot;She Mine&quot; have seen some comparisons to the Doors, the Rolling Stones and the Stooges, as noted by &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reviewer Jaan Uhelszki. The &quot;New York Post&quot; commented that &quot;Slash&#x27;s guitar riffs throughout this new record are as aggressive as a caged cat&quot; and &quot;singer Scott Weiland&#x27;s vocals are crisp and controlled yet passionate.&quot;

<text>The 1931 United Kingdom general election was held on Tuesday, 27 October 1931. It saw a landslide election victory for the National Government, a three-party coalition which had been formed two months previously after the collapse of the second Labour government. Journalist Ivor Bulmer-Thomas described the result as &quot;the most astonishing in the history of the British party system&quot;. 

Unable to secure support from his cabinet for his preferred policy responses to the economic and social crises brought about by the Great Depression, Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald split from the Labour Party and formed a new national government in coalition with the Conservative Party and a number of Liberals. MacDonald subsequently campaigned for a &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Mandate&quot; to do whatever was necessary to fix the economy, running as the leader of a new party called National Labour within the coalition. Disagreement over whether to join the new government also resulted in the Liberal Party splitting into three separate factions, including one led by former Prime Minister David Lloyd George.

Collectively, the parties forming the National Government won 67% of the popular vote and 554 (90.1%) of 615 seats in the House of Commons. Although the bulk of the National Government&#x27;s support came from the Conservative Party, which won a majority in its own right with 470 seats, MacDonald remained Prime Minister. The Labour Party suffered its greatest ever defeat—losing four-fifths of its seats, including the seat of leader Arthur Henderson—and became the official opposition with just 52 MPs. The collapse of the Liberals into competing factions also ended their time as a significant force in British politics; the breakaway National Liberals were eventually absorbed into the Conservatives in 1947, while the main Liberal Party would spend the next half-century in the political wilderness until its revival in the 1970s.

It is the most recent election in which any single party (the Conservatives) received an absolute majority of the votes cast, and the last UK general election not to take place on a Thursday. It was also the last election until 1997 in which any single party won more than 400 seats.

==Background==
After battling with the Great Depression for two years, the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald was faced with a budget crisis in August 1931. The cabinet deadlocked over its response, with several influential members—such as Arthur Henderson—unwilling to support budget cuts (in particular a cut in the rate of unemployment benefit) which were pressed by the civil service and opposition parties. Crucially, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden refused to consider deficit spending or tariffs as alternative solutions, and without any other options to address the crisis the government was forced to resign. However, MacDonald was encouraged by King George V to form an all-party National Government in coalition with the Conservatives and Liberals in order to break the deadlock.

The initial hope was that the coalition government would hold office for only a few weeks in order to address the country&#x27;s immediate economic crises, then dissolve for a return to ordinary party politics—but when the government was forced to remove the pound sterling from the gold standard it became clear that it would require more time in office. Meanwhile, the Labour Party expelled all those who were supporting the government, and MacDonald&#x27;s decision to lead a Conservative-dominated coalition instead of the party he had co-founded was labelled a &quot;betrayal&quot; by his erstwhile colleagues and supporters. 

The Conservatives began pressing their partners to fight an election together as a combined unit in order to secure a mandate for radical economic reform, and MacDonald&#x27;s supporters from the Labour Party formed the National Labour Organisation to support him. While initially against an early election, MacDonald came to endorse the idea in order to take advantage of Labour&#x27;s unpopularity due to its poor economic record in office.

However, the Liberals were sceptical about an election and had to be persuaded. The key issue was the Conservatives&#x27; wish to introduce protectionist trade policies: the majority of the Liberals, led by Sir Herbert Samuel, were opposed, considering support for free trade to be a non-negotiable component of the Liberal political tradition. The argument split the party in half: Samuel withdrew the Liberals from the National Government (though continued to lend it their confidence, and still stood in the election as part of the coalition), while the National Liberals—under the leadership of Sir John Simon—remained, willing to support protectionism.

While this was happening, former prime minister David Lloyd George was still technically the Liberal Party&#x27;s leader—however, due to having undergone an operation in early 1931, with a long recuperation, he was unable to take up a ministerial role when the National Government was formed. While initially supportive of both the coalition and its protectionist trade policy, he strongly opposed the proposal for an election. He and a third faction of Liberal MPs—the Independent Liberals—also broke away, and ran in the election on an anti-National Government platform.

Parliament was dissolved on 7 October. In order to appease the various factions within the coalition its manifesto avoided proposing any specific policy, and instead asked voters for a &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Mandate&quot; to do whatever was necessary to rescue the economy. Individual candidates were then allowed to state their support for policies such as trade tariffs.

Labour campaigned on opposition to public spending cuts, but this was a difficult position to justify when many of the cuts had initially been agreed when Labour was in government. By 1931, Labour had lost significant economic credibility due to soaring unemployment—especially in coal, textiles, shipbuilding and steel—and the party&#x27;s working class base increasingly lost confidence in its ability to solve the most pressing problems facing the country.

An additional problem for Labour came from the 2.5 million Irish Catholics in England and Scotland, who had traditionally been a major component of their working class base. By 1930 a number of Catholic bishops had grown increasingly alarmed at the party&#x27;s stances on Communist Russia, birth control, and especially regarding funding Catholic schools, and the Church began to warn its members against voting Labour. This shift played a major role in Labour&#x27;s collapse in support in some urban areas.

==Outcome==
The election was a landslide for the National Government coalition, which won 67.2% of the popular vote and 518 seats out of 615 in the House of Commons—for both, it stands as the largest share ever secured in a British general election since the passage of the Reform Act 1832. (The next-best results were both was secured by the Whigs in 1832, who won 67.01% of the vote and 67.02% of seats under a substantially different electoral system with a much smaller electorate.) However, by far the largest share of the government&#x27;s seats was won by the Conservatives, and the party&#x27;s 470 seats also remains the record for the largest share of the total seats in Parliament (76.4%) won by any single party. 

The victory gave the National Government a clear mandate to enact its policy platform, which the coalition believed would pull the economy out of the doldrums of the Great Depression. MacDonald remained Prime Minister, but the Conservatives were the dominant party within the coalition—National Labour contested only 20 seats, winning 13—and with his increasingly poor health over the course of the parliament he came to be more of a figurehead for the government rather than an active leader. 

Labour&#x27;s loss of vote share (a drop of 6.5%) was average by historical standards, but the inefficiency of its vote distribution under first-past-the-post meant that the party suffered a net loss of 235 out of 287 seats. This remains Labour&#x27;s most significant absolute and per capita election loss, and it stood as the record for greatest number of seats lost by any party in a single general election until the Conservatives lost a net of 251 seats under Rishi Sunak in 2024.

==Transfers of seats==
This differs from the above list in including seats where the incumbent was standing down and therefore there was no possibility of any one person being defeated. The aim is to provide a comparison with the previous election. In addition, it provides information about which party gained the seat.

* All comparisons are with the 1929 election.
**In some cases the change is due to the MP defecting to the gaining party. Such circumstances are marked with a *.
**In other circumstances the change is due to the seat having been won by the gaining party in a by-election in the intervening years, and then retained in 1931. Such circumstances are marked with a †.

:1 Sitting MP had defected to the New Party
:2 Sitting MP had defected to National Labour

<text>George Leonard Carey, Baron Carey of Clifton (born 13 November 1935) is a retired Anglican bishop who was the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1991 to 2002, having previously been the Bishop of Bath and Wells.

During his time as archbishop the Church of England ordained its first women priests and the debate over attitudes to homosexuality became more prominent, especially at the 1998 Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops.

In June 2017, Carey resigned from his last formal role in the church after Dame Moira Gibb&#x27;s independent investigation found he covered up, by failing to pass to police, six out of seven serious sex abuse allegations relating to 17- to 25-year-olds against Bishop Peter Ball a year after Carey became archbishop. The next year the UK Child Sex Abuse Report confirmed Carey had committed serious breaches of duty in wrongly discrediting credible allegations of child sex abuse within the Church and failing to accompany disciplinary action with adding to the church&#x27;s own safeguarding watchlist. In February 2018 Carey was granted permission to officiate by Steven Croft, the bishop of Oxford, allowing him to preach and preside at churches in the diocese. This was revoked on 17 June 2020 after the Church found Carey could have done more to pass to police allegations of beatings by a barrister John Smyth, who drew his victims from schools and evangelical children&#x27;s camps. Permission was restored to Carey by the Bishop of Oxford seven months later.

==Early life==
George Carey was born on 13 November 1935 in the East End of London in England. He attended Bonham Road Primary School in Dagenham, then failed his 11-plus. He then attended Bifrons Secondary Modern School in Barking before leaving at the age of 15. He worked for the London Electricity Board as an office boy before starting his National Service at the age of 18 in the Royal Air Force as a wireless operator, during which time he served in Iraq.

==Conversion and ordination==
Carey became a committed Christian at the age of 17 when he attended a church service with some friends. He said &quot;I had a conversion experience which was very real ... There were no blinding lights, simply a quiet conviction I had found something.&quot;

During his National Service, Carey decided to seek ordination and after his discharge he studied intensely, gaining six O-levels and three A-levels in 15 months. He studied at King&#x27;s College London, graduated as a Bachelor of Divinity from the University of London in 1962 with a 2:1 degree, and was subsequently ordained. He later obtained a Master of Theology degree and a Ph.D. from the University of Durham. Carey is the first Archbishop of Canterbury since the Middle Ages not to have been a graduate of either Oxford or Cambridge. The last Archbishop of Canterbury before Carey who had not been a graduate of one or both was Simon Sudbury ( 1316–1381).

==Offices==
Carey was a curate at St Mary&#x27;s Islington, worked at Oak Hill Theological College and St John&#x27;s Theological College, Nottingham and became Vicar of St Nicholas&#x27; Church, Durham, in 1975. Within two years he had trebled the congregation. He later wrote a book on his experiences there called &quot;The Church in the Market Place&quot;.

In 1981, Carey was appointed Principal of Trinity College, Bristol. He became Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1987; he was consecrated a bishop by Robert Runcie, Archbishop of Canterbury, at Southwark Cathedral on 3 December 1987 (by which point his election must have been confirmed) and enthroned in February 1988.

When Robert Runcie retired as Archbishop of Canterbury, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, encouraged by her former Parliamentary Private Secretary, Michael Alison MP, put Carey&#x27;s name forward to the Queen for appointment. The religious correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;, Clifford Longley, commented that &quot;Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s known impatience with theological and moral woolliness ... will have been a factor.&quot;

Carey was confirmed as Archbishop of Canterbury on 27 March 1991 and enthroned on 19 April 1991.

On 31 October 2002, Carey retired, resigning the See of Canterbury, and the next day was created a life peer as Baron Carey of Clifton, &quot;of Clifton in the City and County of Bristol&quot;, meaning that he remained a member of the House of Lords, where he sat as a crossbencher. He was succeeded as archbishop by Rowan Williams. Living in the Diocese of Oxford, until 2017 Carey served there as an honorary assistant bishop, as is customary for retired bishops.

Carey was Chancellor of the University of Gloucestershire for seven years, resigning in 2010, and was president of the London School of Theology. He is also an Honorary Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Scriveners and a Distinguished Fellow of the Library of Congress (Washington, DC).

==Handling of Peter Ball and other sex abuse allegations==
During Carey&#x27;s term as Archbishop of Canterbury, there were many complaints of serial sex abuse made against Peter Ball, the Bishop of Lewes and later of Gloucester until his resignation in 1993 after admitting to an act of gross indecency. Archbishop Carey wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of Gloucester police, supporting Ball and saying that he was suffering &quot;excruciating pain and spiritual torment&quot;. In October 2015 Ball was sentenced to 32 months imprisonment for misconduct in public office and indecent assault; he admitted the abuse of 18 young men aged 17–25.

Justin Welby, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 2013, commissioned an independent review by Dame Moira Gibb in February 2016 to deal with the systematic failing of the Church in handling Ball&#x27;s case.

In a statement submitted by Carey to pre-trial hearings regarding Ball, Carey said: &quot;I was worried that if any other allegations were made it would reignite a police investigation. I was told quite categorically that any past indecency matters would not be taken further.&quot; Carey said the senior CPS official told him: &quot;As far as we are concerned he has resigned. He is out of it. We are not going to take anything any further.&quot; He has repeatedly asserted that he was not trying to influence the outcome of the investigation.

On 22 October 2016 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Carey accepted that he deserved criticism over his support of Peter Ball. Carey had requested that his, rather than the Church&#x27;s, lawyers should represent him at the government&#x27;s Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse where Carey had been granted &quot;core participation&quot; status, with the Church of England paying for the lawyers.

Gibb&#x27;s June 2017 report, &quot;An Abuse of Faith&quot;, found that Carey was part of a cover-up that shielded Bishop Ball from prosecution. The review found that Carey had received seven letters from families and individuals following Ball&#x27;s arrest in 1992, but passed only one (the least disturbing) to the police. Carey did not add Ball to the Church of England&#x27;s &quot;Lambeth List&quot; which names clergy about whom questions of suitability for ministry have been raised, but provided Ball with funds, and wrote to Ball&#x27;s brother Bishop Michael Ball in 1993, saying &quot;I believed him to be basically innocent&quot;. Graham Sawyer, who survived abuse by Peter Ball, wants the police to investigate Carey&#x27;s role in the Ball affair.

Following the production of the report, with its finding that he had covered up sex abuse allegations against bishop Peter Ball, Carey stated that the report made &quot;deeply uncomfortable reading&quot; and apologised to Ball&#x27;s victims. Welby asked Carey to step down as an assistant bishop in the Church of England. On 26 June, having spoken to the Bishop of Oxford, Carey resigned from his post as an honorary assistant bishop within the Diocese of Oxford, his last formal role in the church. However, Carey did not resign his orders, nor his seat in the House of Lords.

His resignation automatically revoked his permission to officiate (PTO), i.e. to preach or minister. He was granted a PTO in the Diocese of Oxford in 2018, conditional on no further concerns coming to light, but this was revoked on 17 June 2020 after new evidence came to light about the failures to consider child protection in regards to leading schools&#x27; children&#x27;s activity and Bible camps run by John Smyth in the 1970s. It was then reinstated in January 2021.

On 4 December 2024 Carey submitted his resignation as a priest from the Church of England, writing &quot;I wish to surrender my Permission to Officiate&quot;.

In the 2020 BBC documentary about Ball, &quot;Exposed: The Church&#x27;s Darkest Secret&quot;, Carey was portrayed in dramatic reconstructions by David Calder.

==Theological and social positions==

Carey&#x27;s theological roots are in the Evangelical tradition of the Church of England. He strongly supported the ordination of women but also has close ecumenical links with the Roman Catholic Church, being chosen in 1976 to represent the Church of England at a meeting of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity in Rome.

Carey is tolerant of divorce and divorced people and the remarriage of divorced people. One of his sons is divorced and he also supported the marriage of the Prince of Wales to Camilla Parker-Bowles, whose first husband is living. He opposed homosexual relationships among members of the clergy, although he admits to having consecrated two bishops whom he suspected of having same-sex partners. He presided over the Lambeth Conference of 1998 and actively supported the conference&#x27;s resolution which uncompromisingly rejected all homosexual practice as &quot;incompatible with scripture&quot;.

Carey was criticised for his lack of neutrality on the issue of homosexuality by those attempting to reach a compromise position which had been presented to the conference by a working group of bishops on human sexuality. Carey also voted against an expressed condemnation (which had been present in the original form of the resolution) of homophobia. The resolution as a whole prompted one of Carey&#x27;s fellow primates, Richard Holloway, Bishop of Edinburgh and Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, to declare &quot;I feel gutted, I feel betrayed, but the struggle will go on&quot;.

Carey said: &quot;If this conference is known by what we have said about homosexuality, then we will have failed.&quot; The resolution, however, was the beginning of an escalating crisis of unity within the Anglican Communion around the question of human sexuality, a crisis that continues. This resolution is at the heart of current divisions within the Anglican Communion on the issue. In 1999 he was one of four English bishops who expressly declined to sign the Cambridge Accord: an attempt to find agreement on affirming certain human rights of homosexuals, notwithstanding differences within the church on the morality of homosexual behaviour. In an interview with Sir David Frost in 2002 he said: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in blessing same-sex relationships because frankly I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m blessing.&quot;

Carey was the first former archbishop of Canterbury to publish his memoirs, in 2004. The book, &quot;Know the Truth&quot;, mentions meetings with the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles and his thoughts that they should marry. In 2005, they did marry in a civil ceremony; the Church carried out a blessing after civil marriage at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

In 1998 Carey made a public call for the humane treatment of Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile, who was at the time in custody in the United Kingdom.

In 2000 Carey was critical of the document &quot;Dominus Iesus&quot;, issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under Pope John Paul II, saying that it &quot;did not reflect the deep comprehension that has been reached through ecumenical dialogue and cooperation [between Roman Catholics and Anglicans] during the past 30 years ... the Church of England and the worldwide Anglican Communion does not for one moment accept that its orders of ministry and Eucharist are deficient in any way. It believes itself to be a part of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church of Christ, in whose name it serves and bears witness, here and round the world.&quot;

==Public statements since retirement==
===On homosexuality===
In 1994, Archbishop Carey voted in the House of Lords to defeat equality legislation that would have lowered the age of consent for homosexual men, from 21 years, to the same age as for heterosexuals (16 years) and again, in 1998, he voted against the equalisation of age of consent, at that time 18, to 16. Since his retirement, Carey has tolerated same-sex partnerships in secular law but continues to oppose same-sex marriage and church blessings of same-sex partnerships. In March 2006, he personally endorsed &quot;with enthusiasm&quot; a questionnaire to American bishops from what he described as &quot;Lay Episcopalians who wish their Church to remain faithful to Orthodox Christianity&quot; in relation to the controversy in that church over the ordination of an openly gay bishop. For this, he was chided by Frank Griswold, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States, &quot;for allowing himself to be used by others whose political ambition is to sow division&quot;.

In late April 2006, Carey said in a televised interview that the ordination of Bishop Gene Robinson of New Hampshire, US, in 2003 verged on heresy because Bishop Robinson is gay and lives in a long-term relationship. His association with Episcopalians Concerned agitated some, and his decision to confirm anti-gay dissidents who refused the ministry of the Bishop of Virginia puzzled the same people. Carey, who remembered the difficulties of the 13th Lambeth Conference that he had presided over in 1998, sought to avoid a major schism in the communion by refraining from further consecrations of gay people.

In April 2010, Carey submitted a witness statement to an appeal court considering the dismissal of a relationship counsellor who had refused to work with homosexuals, in which he suggested that intervention by senior clerics, including himself, was &quot;indicative of a future civil unrest&quot;. In the same statement, he suggested that cases engaging religious rights should not be heard by any of the judges who had decided the previous cases, &quot;as they have made clear their lack of knowledge about the Christian faith.&quot; His submission was rejected by the Court as &quot;misplaced&quot; and &quot;deeply inimical to the public interest&quot;. Carey&#x27;s position was widely criticised in the press. Andrew Brown, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, suggested that the effect of the judgment was to say that Carey was &quot;a self-important and alarmist twit who has no idea what he is talking about&quot;. The &quot;Church Times&quot; commented that &quot;One might be forgiven for thinking that Lord Carey of Clifton has generated more column-inches since retiring as Archbishop of Canterbury than he did when in office. His latest foray into the nation&#x27;s media is more than usually regrettable, as it strikes at the heart of the independence of the judiciary.&quot; However, his position was supported by his former colleague, the retired Bishop of Rochester, Michael Nazir-Ali.

===On Muslims===
As Archbishop of Canterbury, Carey was active in inter-faith work and worked for better relations with Muslims, calling for &quot;deeper dialogue&quot; between the two faiths. On 25 March 2004, after his retirement, he made a speech lamenting the lack of democracy and innovation in Muslim countries, suggesting a lack of critical scholarship toward the Qur&#x27;an and saying that moderate Muslims should &quot;resist strongly&quot; the take-over of Islam by extremists. He also criticised the majority of Muslims, who do not support extremists, for not denouncing them. Some viewed his speech as an outspoken attack on Islam; Carey responded: &quot;Those who took the trouble to read my lecture will have noted that I was as critical of the West, of Christianity and, for that matter, also sharply critical of Israel&#x27;s policy with respect to Palestine.&quot;

In September 2006, Carey backed Pope Benedict XVI in the controversy over his comments on Islam and declared that &quot;there will be no significant material and economic progress [in Muslim communities] until the Muslim mind is allowed to challenge the status quo of Muslim conventions and even their most cherished shibboleths&quot;.

===On matters of trade===
In February 2006, Carey attracted more controversy by declaring in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; that a General Synod motion supported by his successor, Rowan Williams, in favour of disinvestment in a company active in the occupied territories of Israel made him ashamed to be an Anglican.

In September 2009, Carey provoked outrage among some Anglicans by making positive remarks about the arms trade. He was quickly condemned by a number of Christian activists, particularly since the Lambeth Conferences in 1988 and 1998 had resolved to oppose the arms trade.

===On Anglican unity===
In April 2006, when criticism of his post-retirement activism on a number of fronts had been voiced in an open letter by liberal laypersons in the church, he issued a public statement complaining that such comments were &quot;mischievous and damaging to the Anglican Communion&quot;. In an interview for the BBC, on 23 April 2006, he said &quot;I think this is a mischievous letter from Australia and I hope the authors will reflect and repent.&quot;

In May 2006, he made a speech to the Virginia Theological Seminary, subsequently published on his personal website, which said &quot;When I left office at the end of 2002 I felt the Anglican Communion was in good heart&quot; but that, as a result of subsequent events &quot;it is difficult to say in what way we are now a Communion.&quot; This was reported on 11 June 2006 in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; and on 12 June 2006 in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; as an attack on his successor. An email from Carey on the day of publication was circulated in which he strongly denied this and said &quot;I am hopping mad and will want a retraction from the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, otherwise I will lodge a complaint.&quot;

In November 2006, Carey was barred from delivering a Church Mission Society lecture at Bangor Cathedral by the Dean of Bangor, who viewed that Carey had become &quot;a factor of disunity and of disloyalty to Rowan Williams, a divisive force.&quot;

===On the British and migration===
As a founding member of the Cross-Party Group on Balanced Migration, Carey wrote an opinion piece in &quot;The Times&quot; in September 2008 in which he advocated for a migration policy based on the group&#x27;s concept of balanced migration (i.e. the number of immigrants entering Britain would have to correspond to the number of emigrants leaving Britain), with this including a cap on the number of migrants allowed to become permanent residents of the United Kingdom; among other statements, he said &quot;If this scale of immigration continues, with people of different faiths, cultures and traditions coming here, what will it mean to be British? [...] Immigration must be kept under control if we are to retain the essentials of British society that have been built up over the generations.&quot; The piece was written in response to an earlier one (also published in &quot;The Times&quot;) by David Aaronovitch, with Aaronovitch&#x27;s characterisation of the Cross-Party Group as seeking to &quot;chuck [immigrants] out&quot; being rejected by Carey.

In January 2010, Carey gave an interview on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme in which he said that while any eventual migration policy should not &quot;give preference to any particular group&quot;, the points-based immigration system should give preferences to certain prospective migrants based on their values and backgrounds. While he denied seeking a limit on &quot;people who are non-Christian populations&quot;, Carey nevertheless stated that immigrants should have an understanding of British history and culture, with Carey emphasising the country&#x27;s Christian heritage as a particular element of this, and of the country&#x27;s &quot;commitment to the English language&quot;. Around the same time, Carey would appear on BBC Radio 5 Live to call for British migration policy to be debated &quot;without any rancour&quot; and to say that priority should be given to immigrants who were committed to &quot;our values&quot; and that, if this was done, most future immigrants would come from historically Christian countries; he also warned that, if immigration was allowed to continue at its current rate, resentment &quot;could build and is building up already&quot; while &quot;dangerous&quot; social conditions such as disproportionate unemployment among ethnic minorities could also emerge.

===On ecumenical matters===
In October 2009, Carey said it was inexcusable that the Vatican gave relatively short notice of its offer to receive some Anglo-Catholics into the Roman Catholic Church within a personal ordinariate, but he nonetheless gave a cautious welcome to the offer.

===On marriage===
In February 2012, speaking at the launch of the advocacy group Coalition for Marriage, Carey voiced his opposition to the government&#x27;s proposal to legalise same-sex marriage, stating that he was &quot;worried and disappointed&quot; and calling the proposal &quot;cultural vandalism&quot;. In March 2013, Carey spoke of being &quot;very suspicious&quot; that behind plans for gay marriage &quot;there lurks an aggressive secularist and relativist approach towards an institution that has glued society&quot;. In May 2013, Carey claimed same-sex marriage could set a &quot;dangerous precedent&quot; which could lead to sibling marriage or polygamy. Carey criticized the British government for seeking to change the definition of marriage to &quot;a long-term commitment between two people of any sex, in which gender and procreation are irrelevant&quot;.

===On religious freedom===
Carey was a leading advocate for the rights of Christians in advance of a case on religious freedom, begun on 4 September 2012 at the European Court of Human Rights, regarding the case of two workers forced out of their jobs over the wearing of crosses as a visible manifestation of their faith.

===On assisted suicide===
In July 2014 he announced that he had changed his view on euthanasia in favour of the legalisation of assisted dying for terminally-ill patients.

===On Syrian Christians===
On 18 July 2015, he lent his name and efforts to the Barnabas Fund, a charity which aimed to place Syrian Christians, whom ISIS target as part of their Islamic supremacist doctrine, at the front of the UK refugee queue. He called on the government to &quot;welcome Christian refugees and give them priority as asylum seekers. Syrian and Iraqi Christians are being butchered, tortured and enslaved. We need the British Government to work with charities like the Barnabas Fund and others to evacuate those who are in desperate fear of their lives.&quot; He was joined by Lord Weidenfeld and the Revd Andrew White, Vicar of Baghdad, as well as many others, in his effort.

==Family==
Carey married Eileen Harmsworth Hood in 1960. They have two sons, Mark (an Anglican priest) and Andrew (formerly Deputy Editor of the &quot;Church of England Newspaper&quot; and later a freelance journalist); and two daughters.

<text>The Great Wall (also called Coma Wall), sometimes specifically referred to as the CfA2 Great Wall, is an immense galaxy filament. It is one of the largest known superstructures in the observable universe. 

This structure was discovered c. 1989 by a team of American astronomers led by Margaret J. Geller and John Huchra while analyzing data gathered by the second CfA Redshift Survey of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian (CfA).

==Characteristics==

The term &quot;Great&quot; has been added to distinguish it as an even larger type compared to standard galaxy walls. 

The CfA2 Great Wall has the maximum dimensions of either 500 million or 750 million light years depending on the figure and the reference used. It is 200 million light years in width and about 16 million light years in thickness. Its nearest point is about 300 million light years from Earth, while its furthest point is 550 million light years away. It consists of three massive galaxy superclusters: Hercules, Coma, and Leo.

The CfA2 Great Wall includes the Coma Filament.

==Components==

It was discovered in 1989 by Margaret Geller and John Huchra based on redshift survey data from the CfA Redshift Survey.

It is not known how much further the wall extends due to the light absorption in the plane of the Milky Way galaxy where Earth is located. The gas and dust from the Milky Way (known as the Zone of Avoidance) obscure the view of astronomers and have so far made it impossible to determine if the wall ends or continues on further than they can currently observe.

In the standard model of the evolution of the universe, such structures as the Great Wall form along and follow web-like strings of dark matter. It is thought that this dark matter dictates the structure of the Universe on the grandest of scales. Dark matter gravitationally attracts baryonic matter, and it is this &quot;normal&quot; matter that astronomers see forming long, thin walls of super-galactic clusters.

<text>The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith (COOLJC) is a Oneness Pentecostal denomination with headquarters in Manhattan. It was founded in 1919 by Robert C. Lawson. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2020, the denomination had 85,938 members in 527 churches.

==History==
The &quot;Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;, as it is most commonly known, was organized by Robert C. Lawson, a protégé of G.T. Haywood, who claimed salvation and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1913.

In 1914 Lawson was called to the ministry and soon began evangelizing, mainly in the Mid-West, and pastoring in Columbus, Ohio. When he found himself at odds with the leadership of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, Lawson resigned from that organization in 1919 and moved to New York City, where he founded the Refuge Church of Christ, after the members of a prayer band in Harlem welcomed him and turned their meetings over to him. That small church grew and became known as the Refuge Temple, and, later, the Greater Refuge Temple. It was the hub of Lawson&#x27;s evangelistic efforts in the Northeast. Lawson&#x27;s field work took him up and down the East Coast, throughout the West Indies, and as far as West Africa, where he appointed missionaries to carry on spiritual work.

The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ has been very influential among African-American Pentecostal churches, and has given rise to several spin-off bodies. The first major break-away was in 1930, when Sherrod C. Johnson created a rival organization, the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, through which he challenged Lawson&#x27;s stance on practical holiness. The most important fracture in the church&#x27;s history, though, came in 1957 when Smallwood E. Williams led about 70 churches away to form the Bible Way Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Other organizations that were born from or splintered from this church body include the Church of God in Christ Jesus International Ministries, Progressive Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Refuge Temple Assembly of Yahweh, the Evangelistic Churches of Christ, a host of small organizations, and independent churches of varying sizes. Furthermore, there have been splits in many of the offshoot churches: for example, the church founded by Sherrod C. Johnson (Church of the Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, also referred to as CLJC) has splintered and re-emerged as the Holy Temple Church of the Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, the Apostolic Ministries of America, and the First Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, all of which are actively evangelizing North America, the Caribbean, Europe, and West Africa. Thus, the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ is the mother of a family of predominantly African-American Pentecostal Apostolic organizations.

After Lawson&#x27;s death in 1961, a rising minister in the organization, William L. Bonner, proposed a change in the church&#x27;s governmental structure. Whereas Bishop Lawson, as founder, had been the sole governing prelate of the organization, Bonner suggested that there be a board of archbishops, or &quot;apostles&quot;, who would govern the churches. Two other groups, the Board of Bishops and the Board of Presbyters, both hold accountable and are held accountable by the Board of Apostles.

The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ has many other auxiliaries that function to serve its members and those of the community. The International Armor Bearers&#x27; Young Peoples&#x27; Union (ABYPU), the International Sunday School Department, the International Missionaries, and the International Congress are a few that work together to bring the ministry to laymen and surrounding communities.

== Doctrine and practice ==
The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ is, historically and doctrinally, a Oneness Pentecostal organization like the United Pentecostal Church and the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. With roots in the earliest years of American Pentecostalism, much of the culture of the church reflects the doctrine of the Holiness movement of the 1800s. Among the practices that separate it from other Pentecostal churches are its outspokenness on the significance of the name &quot;Lord Jesus Christ&quot;, especially as a baptismal formula; a very conservative dress code, which includes the wearing of hats or some other type of headcovering (e.g., prayer veil) by women during church services; insistence on wine to be used during communion; strict interpretation of New Testament scriptures concerning divorce and remarriage; and the disallowance of women as pastors. (These last two were Lawson&#x27;s points of disagreement with the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World.)

==Organization and membership==
Governance of the church includes the Chief Apostle, the Presiding Apostle, the Board of Apostles, the Board of Bishops, the Executive Secretary, and the General Council. Apostolic Faith is based on the teaching Jesus passed down to the twelve apostles, book of Act 2. The Apostolic church is oneness, open to all people. 

Major laity-driven auxiliaries are Women&#x27;s Council; Ministers&#x27; and Deacons&#x27; Wives&#x27; Guild; the International Sunday School Association and the Armor Bearers&#x27; Young People&#x27;s Union, which together make up the International Congress; and the International Music Department. Though women are not ordained, they are licensed as social, senior, and field Missionaries through the organization&#x27;s International Missionary Department. There is also a Deacon&#x27;s Union.

In 1990 the church had about 30,000 members in 450 churches in the United States. In 2018, there are now 1,200 churches worldwide, including congregations in West Africa, Mexico, Canada, the British West Indies, the Dominican Republic, England, Haiti, and the Philippines. Its U.S. membership is predominantly Black-American. Headquartered at Greater Refuge Temple Church in Harlem, New York City, the church operates W. L. Bonner College in Columbia, South Carolina and the Church of Christ Bible Institute in New York City.

<text>The United Christian Democratic Party is a minor political party in South Africa. It was founded by Lucas Mangope, leader of the Bophuthatswana bantustan in 1997, as a successor to the Tswana National Party, and led by him for the first fifteen years of its existence. Mavis Matladi was elected as its leader on 29 January 2011 after the expulsion of Mangope. Matladi died in December 2011. Isaac Sipho Mfundisi was elected president on Saturday, 7 January 2012.

Mfundisi was succeeded by the current President Modiri Desmond Sehume who was elected in the Federal Congress in 2019.

Most of the party&#x27;s support comes from the North West province (where the old Bophuthatswana was located), and it has very little presence elsewhere in the country. The UCDP was the official opposition to the African National Congress in the North West province in 1999 and 2004, but slipped to fourth in the provincial legislature in 2009, and lost all of its seats in the provincial legislature in 2014.

In the 2009 elections, the party won 66,086 votes (0.37% of the national total), and two seats in Parliament, representing a loss of approximately 50% of its support, and one seat, from the preceding elections.

In the provincial elections, their support dropped from 8.49% and three seats in the 2004 North West provincial election, to 5.27% and two seats in 2009. In 2009, in six of the other provinces, they gained less than 0.1% support.

In the 2014 elections, the party slumped further, losing all of its provincial and national seats.

After the 2021 municipal elections, the UCDP retains a small presence at local level with elected representatives in five municipalities, all in the North West.

The party&#x27;s mission statement stresses the need for Christian values, non-racial democracy, and government inducements for personal self-reliance, while the 2004 manifesto attacked the ANC for, among other things, its alleged softness on crime, nepotism, and neglect of South African infrastructure.

A 2003 survey conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council found that 85% of UCDP voters were female.

<text>The Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) was a political party in Kenya. It was founded in 1960 when several leading politicians refused to join Jomo Kenyatta&#x27;s Kenya African National Union (KANU). It was led by Ronald Ngala who was joined by Moi&#x27;s Kalenjin Political Alliance, the Masai
United Front, the Kenya African Peoples Party, the Coast African Political Union, Masinde Muliro&#x27;s Baluhya Political Union and the Somali National Front. The separate tribal organisations were to retain their identity and so, from the very start, KADU based its political approach on tribalism. KADU&#x27;s aim was to defend the interests of the so-called KAMATUSA (an acronym for Kalenjin, Maasai, Turkana and Samburu ethnic groups) as well as the British settlers, against the imagined future dominance of the larger Luo and Kikuyu that comprised the majority of KANU&#x27;s membership, when it became inevitable that Kenya will achieve its independence. The KADU objective was to work towards a multiracial self government within the existing colonial political system. After release of Jomo Kenyatta, KADU was becoming increasingly popular with European settlers and, on the whole, repudiated Kenyatta&#x27;s leadership. KADU&#x27;s plan at Lancaster meetings was devised by European supporters, essentially to protect prevailing British settlers land rights.

==History==
In 1953 Kenya African Union, KAU was banned and its leaders, the Kapenguria Six imprisoned by the colonial authorities. The colonial authorities could not conceive of any political opposition to their policies, nor could they accept the reality of African aspirations strongly advocated by Jomo Kenyatta, Dedan Kimathi and other African leaders However, Mau Mau insurgency, though defeated in 1956 led to changes in the way the colony was governed and a new constitution was inaugurated in 1954.Under the new constitution of 1954, it was believed that any solution to the African problems lay in the initiative of the colonial administration under European leadership, not in changing the political system as Africans had demanded under the banned KAU. To ensure no national African political movement arises to unite Africans and threaten colonial government, national political parties were banned in 1955. The colonial authorities instead promoted the idea of regional &quot;moderate&quot; tribal political parties all over the country other than in central Kenya where the political party ban remained until 1960.Regional moderate &#x27;kingpins&#x27; subsequently emerged with their regional political parties. These included Daniel Moi, Masinde Muliro and Ronald Ngala. Majority of these regional leaders had been elected to the LegCo in 1957 general elections. Ronald Ngala brought all these regional outfits together to form KADU when Jomo Kenyatta was released from prison in 1961 and made the president of the newly formed KANU

KADU lost to KANU in the first general elections in Kenya in 1963, where it had campaigned on a platform of Majimboism, multiracial nation with white minority rule under the principles established in the &quot;Lyttelton Constitution&quot; of 1954. KANU on the other hand had campaigned on total independence of Kenya under African majority rule with a new independence constitution. KADU delegation at Kenya&#x27;s Lancaster house constitutional conference negotiated for and got federalism (Majimbo) adopted into Kenya&#x27;s independence constitution. In the Lancaster House Conference attended by Kenyatta, KADU&#x27;s plan was strongly supported, not just by the Europeans but also by the British government. In the end, KANU abandoned its own plan and accepted a British version of the KADU plan, providing for a bicameral legislature and for eight &#x27;jimbos&#x27; with regional presidents.

==Dissolution==
KADU dissolved in 1964 and merged with KANU under the great persuasive abilities of Tom Mboya upon the KADU leadership. Daniel arap Moi, who later served as President of Kenya, was KADU&#x27;s chairman and attended the Lancaster House Conferences with Ronald Ngala. Part of the KADU team was also Masinde Muliro who believed that the dominance of the two tribes needed to be neutralised so as to have a free and fairly led nation. The dissolution of KADU was orchestrated by the then justice and legal affairs minister Tom Mboya, first Secretary General and a founding member of KANU, who followed orders from the then President of Kenya, the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta.

<text>The Road to Canossa or Humiliation of Canossa (), or, sometimes, the Walk to Canossa (/&quot;Kanossa&quot;) was the journey of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV to Canossa Castle in 1077, and his subsequent ritual submission there to Pope Gregory VII. It took place during the Investiture controversy and involved the Emperor seeking absolution and the revocation of his excommunication by the Pope who had been staying at the castle as the guest of Margravine Matilda of Tuscany.

According to contemporary sources, he was forced to supplicate on his knees, waiting for three days and nights before the castle gate while a blizzard raged, &quot;one of the most dramatic moments of the Middle Ages&quot;. The episode has spurred much debate among medieval chroniclers as well as modern historians, who dispute whether the walk was a humiliating defeat for the emperor or a &quot;brilliant masterstroke&quot;.

== Historical background ==

The Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor had disputed the relative precedence of ecclesiastical and secular power since the spread of the Gregorian Reforms in the 11th century. When Gregory VII, acclaimed Pope by the people of Rome in 1073, attempted to enact reforms to the investiture process by his &quot;Dictatus papae&quot; decree, he was met by resistance from Henry IV. The king insisted that he reserve the traditionally established right of previous emperors to &quot;invest&quot; bishops, abbots and other clergymen, despite the papal decree.

The conflict became increasingly severe, after Henry had been able to suppress the Saxon Rebellion in the Battle of Langensalza in June 1075. In September he installed a new Bishop of Milan, which annoyed Gregory, who openly required obedience. Shortly afterwards the Pope was attacked while leading the 1075 Christmas celebrations and taken to jail by a mob. The next day his followers mobbed the prison and brought him back to the church, where he picked up Mass where he had left off. On 24 January 1076, Henry assembled several German bishops in a synod at Worms, where the ecclesiastical dignitaries abandoned all commitments to the Pope. The king finally demanded Gregory&#x27;s abdication, referring to the rules of papal election according to the &quot;In nomine Domini&quot; bull of 1059.

In response, Gregory excommunicated and deposed Henry in the Lenten synod of 1076 at Rome. He stated furthermore that, one year from that day, the loss of kingship would become irrevocable.

== Journey ==

Gregory had also declared the oaths of allegiance sworn by the Princes null and void, which turned out to be more dangerous to Henry&#x27;s rule, as the development met the interests of several territorial rulers in the Empire. When in October the Patriarch of Aquileia and the papal legate met with German princes at Trebur, they swore an oath not to recognize Henry unless the ban was lifted within a year. Fearing further rebellion among the German aristocracy, Henry felt he had to get rid of his excommunication. He was still popular among the common people, but the princes were threatening to elect a new king. He had to secure his position in the church before the rapidly approaching deadline given by the pope.

On the suggestion of his advisers, he arranged to meet with the Pope, who had set out along the path across the Alps towards Augsburg. Henry commenced his trip in Speyer and, travelling southward up the Rhine, he found his position precarious. As the Swabian nobles refused to open the way to the Alpine passes, the king had to move through Burgundy and cross the Alps at steep Mont Cenis. According to the chronicles by Lambert of Hersfeld, Henry, his wife Bertha of Savoy, and their young son Conrad risked their lives by crossing the Alpine crest in harsh mid-winter conditions. After a long journey, they reached Gregory&#x27;s accommodation in Canossa on 25 January 1077.

== At the castle ==
When Henry reached Matilda&#x27;s castle, the Pope ordered that he be refused entry. Waiting at the gates, Henry took on the behavior of penance. He wore a hair-shirt, the traditional clothing of monks at the time, and allegedly walked barefoot. Many of his entourage, including the queen Bertha of Savoy and the prince Conrad, also supposedly removed their shoes. According to Lambert of Hersfeld and first-hand accounts of the scene (letters written by both Gregory and Henry in the following years), the king waited by the gate for three full days. Throughout this time, he allegedly wore only his penitent hair-shirt and fasted.

Finally, on 28 January, the castle gates were opened for Henry and he was allowed to enter. Contemporary accounts report that he knelt before Pope Gregory and begged his forgiveness. Gregory absolved Henry and invited him back into the Church. That evening, Gregory, Henry, and Matilda of Tuscany shared communion in the chapel of Sant&#x27;Apollonio inside the castle, signaling the official end of Henry&#x27;s excommunication.

Whether Henry actually did formal repentance has not been conclusively established. In any case, he regained his freedom to act and quickly returned to Germany, while Gregory remained with Matilda at the castle and in other locations in Tuscany for several months.

== Historical impact ==
The immediate effects of the Canossa meeting were limited. Although Henry was restored to the Church, any expectations that the Pope would restore support of Henry&#x27;s right to the throne were soon dashed; in March, a small group of powerful Saxon and South German territorial magnates, including the archbishops of Salzburg, Mainz and Magdeburg and several bishops, met at Forchheim and, on the assumption that Henry had irretrievably lost the imperial dignity, repudiated the Salian dynasty&#x27;s claim to pass the imperial crown by heredity and, in the words of Bruno of Merseburg, present in his bishop&#x27;s entourage, declared that &quot;the son of a king, even if he should be preeminently worthy, should become king by a spontaneous election&quot;. The Pope confirmed the agreement. His deposition still in effect, Henry was forced into civil war with Duke Rudolph of Swabia. Gregory levied a second excommunication against Henry, who ultimately won the civil war, invaded Rome, and forced Gregory to flee, replacing him with Antipope Clement III.

In 1728, when Gregory was canonized by Pope Benedict XIII, the papal decree caused offence among European monarchs and its publication was banned by Emperor Charles VI.

Later in history, the event took on a more secular meaning: the rejection of its example came to stand for Germany&#x27;s refusal to be subjected to any outside power (although still especially, but not exclusively, the Catholic Church). The incident first was perpetuated by the Austrian politician and poet Anton Alexander von Auersperg (Anastasius Grün) in an 1868 speech before the House of Lords on the implementation of civil marriage. After German unification, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, when his Pulpit Paragraph and the Jesuits Law sparked the so-called &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; with Pope Pius IX, assured his countrymen in a Reichstag speech that &quot;We will not go to Canossa–neither in body nor in spirit!&quot; This meant that Germany would stand for itself and not abide any outside interference in its politics, religion or culture.

==Modern usage==
In modern usage, &quot;going to Canossa&quot; refers to an act of penance or submission. To &quot;go to Canossa&quot; is an expression that describes doing penance, often with the connotation that it is unwilling or coerced. For example, Adolf Hitler used the expression to describe his meetings with Bavarian Minister President Heinrich Held after being released from Landsberg Prison in 1924, in his bid to have the ban on the Nazi Party lifted. In 1938 Sir Robert Vansittart called Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s meeting with Hitler at Berchtesgaden &quot;like Henry IV going to Canossa all over again.&quot; 

It is used often in German (&quot;Gang nach Canossa&quot;), Dutch (&quot;naar Canossa gaan&quot;), Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish (&quot;Canossavandring&quot; or &quot;Kanossagång&quot;), Finnish (&quot;ryömiä Kanossaan&quot;), French (&quot;aller à Canossa&quot;), Hungarian (&quot;kanosszajárás&quot;), Italian (&quot;andare a Canossa&quot;), Slovenian (&quot;pot v Canosso&quot;), Hebrew (&quot;הליכה לקנוסה&quot; - &quot;halikha le&#x27;kanossa&quot;) and Polish (&quot;idąc do Kanossy&quot;).

<text>Patrick Hart Cash (born 27 May 1965) is an Australian former professional tennis player and coach. He reached a career-high ATP singles ranking of world No. 4 in May 1988 and a career-high ATP doubles ranking of world No. 6 in August 1988. Upon winning the 1987 singles title at Wimbledon, Cash climbed into the stands to celebrate, starting a tradition that has continued ever since.

==Early life==
Cash is the son of Pat Cash Sr., who played for the Hawthorn Football Club in the 1950s. He grew up in Melbourne and was educated at Marcellin College and Whitefriars College.

==Career==
===Junior years===
Cash came to the tennis world&#x27;s attention as a prominent and promising junior player in the early 1980s. He was awarded a scholarship at the Australian Institute of Sport. He was ranked the No. 1 junior player in the world in 1981.

In June 1982, Cash won the junior doubles title at the French Open partnering John Frawley. In July he won the junior singles title at Wimbledon, and while partnering Frawley, he also won the junior doubles title at the same tournament. In September, he won the junior singles title at the US Open, and while partnering Frawley, he was also the runner-up of the junior doubles at the same tournament.

===Professional years===
Cash turned professional in late 1982 and won his first top-level singles title that year in Melbourne.

In 1983, Cash became the youngest player to play in a Davis Cup final. He won the decisive singles rubber against Joakim Nyström as Australia defeated Sweden 3–2 to claim the cup.

In 1984, Cash reached the singles semifinals at both Wimbledon and the US Open, beating Mats Wilander in both. He lost in three sets in the Wimbledon semifinals to John McEnroe and was defeated in the semifinals at the US Open by Ivan Lendl, who won their match in a fifth-set tiebreaker after saving a match point. This day is regarded as one of the greatest days in US Open history because it featured the three set thriller women&#x27;s final Chris Evert vs Martina Navratilova and a John McEnroe vs Jimmy Connors five set marathon semifinal – creating the day now known as &#x27;Super Saturday&#x27;. Cash finished the year in top 10 for the first time.

Cash was the runner-up in the doubles competition at Wimbledon in both 1984 with Paul McNamee and 1985 with John Fitzgerald.

In 1986, just prior to Wimbledon, Cash had an emergency appendix operation. He reached the quarterfinals, playing &quot;breath-taking tennis&quot; to beat Mats Wilander in the fourth round in only his sixth match (excluding 1986 World Team Cup) in 12 months. During the championship he started the now common tradition of throwing wristbands and headbands into the crowd. Cash helped Australia regain the Davis Cup with a 3–2 victory over Sweden. Cash again won the decisive singles rubber, recovering from two sets down against Mikael Pernfors.

1987 was a particularly strong year for Cash. He reached five singles finals, of which two were Grand Slam finals. Cash reached his first Grand Slam singles final at the Australian Open, beating Ivan Lendl in a four hour, four set semi final. He lost the final in five sets to Stefan Edberg. This was the last Australian Open played at Kooyong on a grass court.
The crowning moment of Cash&#x27;s career came in 1987 at Wimbledon. Having already beaten Marcel Freeman, Paul McNamee, Michiel Schapers, Guy Forget, Mats Wilander in the quarterfinals and Jimmy Connors in the semifinals, Cash defeated the world No. 1, Ivan Lendl, in the final in straight sets. Cash sealed the victory by climbing into the stands and up to the player&#x27;s box at Centre Court, where he celebrated with his family, girlfriend, and coach, Ian Barclay. He thus started a Wimbledon tradition that has been followed by many other champions at Wimbledon and other Grand Slam tournaments since. He only dropped one set during the entire tournament. He finished the year ranked at No. 7.

In 1988, Cash reached the Australian Open final for the second consecutive year, beating Ivan Lendl in five sets in the semis, as Lendl struggled in the latter stages due to heat and Cash repeated his tactics of the 1987 Wimbledon final. He faced Mats Wilander in the final. It was the first men&#x27;s singles final played at the new Melbourne Park venue on hard court, and Wilander won in a four-and-a-half-hour encounter, taking the fifth set 8–6. It was the first men&#x27;s Grand Slam final in history to be played indoors after rain delays forced the closing of the roof midway through the match. Cash also reached his career-high ranking of world No. 4 in May.

Coming in as the defending champion in 1988 at Wimbledon, Cash was seeded fourth and only dropped two sets (both during the second round) en route to the quarterfinals, but his run came to an end when he lost to sixth seed and eventual runner-up Boris Becker. It was the last time he reached the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam tournament in singles. 1988 was the last time Cash ended the year in the top 20, finishing the year ranked 20th, after having been ranked inside the top 10 from the start of the year until 21 November.

In April 1989, Cash ruptured his Achilles tendon at the Japan Open and was out of action until March 1990.

Cash played in his third Davis Cup final in 1990. This time, Australia lost 2–3 to the United States.

Cash continued to play on the circuit on-and-off through the mid-1990s. A series of consecutive injuries to his Achilles tendon, knees, and back prevented him from recapturing his best form after winning Wimbledon in 1987. He won his last top-level singles title in April 1990 at the Hong Kong Open. His last doubles title came in 1996 at the U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Championships with Pat Rafter.

Cash established a reputation on the tour as a hard-fighting serve-and-volleyer and for wearing his trademark black-and-white checked headband and his cross earring. For most of his career, Cash was coached by Melbourne-born tennis coach Ian Barclay.

===Post-retirement===
Since his retirement from the tour in 1997, Cash has resided mainly in London. He is the host of CNN&#x27;s tennis-focused magazine show &quot;Open Court&quot;, and has also worked as a TV co-commentator, primarily for the BBC. Cash continues to be a draw card on both the ATP and Champions Cup legends tours. He won the Hall of Fame event in Newport Rhode Island in 2008 and 2009. He has coached top players including Greg Rusedski and Mark Philippoussis.

Cash opened a tennis academy on the Gold Coast of Australia and is also opening academies in Ko Samui, Thailand and in the Caribbean St Vincent, St Lucia and Dominican Republic.

Cash was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2005.

Cash won the over-45s Wimbledon doubles title with fellow Australian Mark Woodforde in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. In November 2014, he played in the inaugural Champions Tennis League in India.

In 2022, Cash appeared on the third British series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; masked as &quot;Bagpipes&quot;. He was fourth to be unmasked.

==Personal life==
In his early twenties, Cash had two children with his then-girlfriend, Norwegian model Anne-Britt Kristiansen. They have a son and a daughter. From 1990 through 2002 Cash was married to Brazilian Emily Bendit. They have twin boys. In 2010, Cash became a grandfather at age 45 when his daughter gave birth to a daughter.

Cash was criticised for stating in an August 2021 interview with &quot;The Conservative Woman&quot;, broadcast online, that he had been taking Ivermectin for more than 15 months, claiming that &quot;I&#x27;m living proof that I have been in the worst areas everywhere around the world and I haven&#x27;t come close to getting COVID&quot;, despite the lack of evidence for the safety or efficacy of the drug for such measures. Cash and former American surfer Kelly Slater were labelled &quot;cookers&quot; (conspiracy theorists) after they exchanged views on Twitter about the concept of the 15-minute city in February 2023.

<text>Sir Grantley Herbert Adams, CMG, QC (28 April 1898 – 28 November 1971) was a Barbadian politician. He served as the inaugural premier of Barbados from 1954 to 1958 and then became the first and only prime minister of the West Indies Federation from 1958 to 1962. He was a founder of the Barbados Labour Party (BLP), and he was named in 1998 as one of the National Heroes of Barbados.

==Early life==
Adams was born at Colliston, Government Hill, St. Michael, on 28 April 1898. He was the third child of seven born to Fitzherbert Adams and the former Rosa Frances Turney. Adams was educated at St. Giles and at Harrison College in Barbados. In 1918, he won the scholarship and departed the following year for his undergraduate studies at Oxford University. Adams played a single match of first-class cricket for Barbados during the 1925–26 season, as a wicket-keeper against British Guiana in the Inter-Colonial Tournament.

==Political career==
Adams&#x27; political interest began when he was still a law student in England. He became a member of the Liberal Party at Oxford, finding his views aligned best with those of the Asquithian liberals, in support of private enterprise and trade. Under the Liberal ideals of the era, support of trade union action, representational government and reform of the land ownership and taxation system were towards the overall goal of fostering free trade.

As the British liberals that shaped him rejected the socialism of the British Labour Party, so too did Adams oppose the labour-focused efforts of the Democratic League of Charles Duncan O&#x27;Neal and Clennell Wickham on his return to Barbados in 1925. He attacked their strike efforts as editor of the Agricultural Reporter, a planter paper that had opposed workers&#x27; rights since its nineteenth century inception. With a growing reputation and popularity among the conservative establishment, Adams&#x27; entry into the House of Assembly in 1934 was assured by his role in the deconstruction of the socialist League, including bankrupting one of the key journalistic voices in support of workers&#x27; rights.

Nevertheless, Adams&#x27; fundamental belief in liberal policies meant that he tended to support pro-working class efforts once he was installed in the House, and continued to espouse many of O’Neale&#x27;s causes after the man&#x27;s passing in 1936. Adams therefore consolidated his position by subsuming the fragmented Labour movement he had shattered, and marrying them to his own liberal ideals. It is this face that embraced the workers&#x27; rebellions of 1937 and lead to the establishment of the Barbados Labour Party in 1938. Adams was president of the Barbados Workers&#x27; Union (BWU) from 1941 to 1954, and was involved in the lowering of the exclusive income qualification in 1942. By 1949, governmental control was wrested from the planters. 

In 1952, Adams became a political enemy of Billy Strachan, a Jamaican communist and former Royal Air Force pilot who went onto become a pioneer of Black civil rights in Britain. Adams ordered Strachan to disband the London branch of the Caribbean Labour Congress, an organisation which Strachan was then the leader of. However, the branch voted overwhelmingly in favour of continuing their activities and ignored Adams&#x27; demand to disband. In further defiance of Adams, Strachan and fellow communist activist Ferdinand Smith conducted a speaking tour of the Caribbean.

Adams became the first Premier of Barbados in 1954 and additionally Minister of Finance in the same year. Four years later he became the Prime Minister of the West Indies Federation, defeating Ashford Sinanan by two votes. (Sinanan went on to serve as Leader of the Opposition of Trinidad&#x27;s Democratic Labour Party.) Adams served this role from 1958 to 1962; Barbados was one of the ten provinces of the West Indies Federation, an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power.

Yet he retained his reputation for conservatism through his support of the monarchy. His leaderships&#x27;s failure to form unions such as the BWU and his rejection of attempts to speed up the push for Independence was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country. Errol Walton Barrow, a fervent reformer, became the new people&#x27;s advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) as the social democrat alternative to Adams&#x27; liberal government, one that cleaved more closely to Labour&#x27;s disruptive traditions. As such, Barrow instituted many progressive social welfare focused on demolishing long-standing class barriers, including free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system, the latter being vehemently derided by Adams himself. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.

==Personal life==
Adams was married to Grace Thorne (1904-1990) in 1929 at St. John&#x27;s Church. Their only child, Tom, himself won the Barbados Scholarship and attended Oxford to become a lawyer. Tom Adams was elected as Barbados&#x27; second Prime Minister in 1976.

==Legacy==

Grantley Adams International Airport, formerly Seawell Airport, located in Christ Church, Barbados, was named after the former Premier in 1976. A statue in honour of Adams is located in front of Government Headquarters at Bay Street, St. Michael.

Adams is one of Barbados&#x27; National Heroes. He was the father of Barbados&#x27; second Prime Minister following independence, the late J. M. G. &quot;Tom&quot; Adams.

Adams was buried in Bridgetown, Barbados, at the churchyard of the Anglican Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels on Saint Michael&#x27;s Row.

The former home of Adams, located on Roebuck Street, Bridgetown, functions as the headquarters of the Barbados Labour Party political group. Adams is featured on the front of the Barbados $100 bill, popularly referred to as a &quot;Grantley&quot;.

<doc id="435565" wikidata="Q886899" url="?curid=435565" title="Blyth, Northumberland">
<text>Blyth () is a port and seaside town as well as a civil parish in southeast Northumberland, England. It lies on the coast, to the south of the River Blyth. It has a population of 39,731 as of the 2021 census, up 6% from the 2011 census and population of 37,347.

The port of Blyth dates from the 12th century, but the development of the modern town only began in the first quarter of the 18th century. The main industries which helped the town prosper were coal mining and shipbuilding, with the salt trade, fishing, and the railways also playing an important role. These industries have largely vanished, but the port still thrives, receiving paper and pulp from Scandinavia for the newspaper industries of England and Scotland.

The town was seriously affected when its principal industries went into decline, and it has undergone much regeneration since the early 1990s. The Keel Row Shopping Centre, opened in 1991, brought major high street retailers to Blyth, and helped to revitalise the town centre. The market place has recently been re-developed, with the aim of attracting further investment to the town.

The Quayside has also seen much redevelopment and has been transformed into a peaceful open space, the centrepiece of which is a sculpture commemorating the industry that once thrived there. On the opposite side of the river are the nine wind turbines of the Blyth Harbour Wind Farm, which were constructed along the East Pier in 1992. They were joined in 2000 by Blyth Offshore Wind Farm, which consisted of two turbines situated out to sea. These were the first two offshore wind turbines in the UK. These wind turbines were all decommissioned, with the final two being removed in 2019. A new windfarm further off the coast, composed of five turbines, was commissioned in 2017.

Blyth is also home to the non-League football club Blyth Spartans, famed for their 1978 &quot;giant-killing&quot; feats in the FA Cup.

== History ==

The place-name Blyth is first attested in 1130 as &quot;Blida&quot;, and takes its name from the river Blyth. The river&#x27;s name comes from the Old English adjective &quot;blīðe&quot; meaning &#x27;gentle&#x27; or &#x27;merry&#x27;. The town of Blyth is referred to as &quot;Blithmuth&quot; in 1236 and &quot;Blithemuth&quot; in 1250. Had this name persisted, the town would today be referred to as &quot;Blythmouth&quot;, on the analogy of Tynemouth to the south.

Little is known of the early development of the Blyth area. The oldest archaeological find is an antler hammer dating from the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age period, which was found at Newsham in 1979.
Human skulls, a spearhead and a sword dating from the Bronze Age were found in the river in 1890, as well as a bronze axe which was found at South Beach in 1993, and a dagger found at Newsham. Although there is no conclusive evidence of a Roman presence in the area, an earthwork shown on early mapping of the area, at the location of present-day Freehold Street, is said to have been a Roman camp, but it has also been argued that it may be of Norsemen origin or date from the Civil War. Debate also surrounds a mosaic which was found near Bath Terrace. The strongest evidence so far has been a single coin, dating from the reign of the Emperor Constans (AD337–350), which was found during excavations for a dry dock. Also four Roman coins were found when digging an air raid shelter in a back garden on Chestnut Avenue.

Between the 12th and 18th centuries, there were several small settlements and some industrial activity in the area. The principal industries during this period were coal mining, fishing and the salt trade. Shipbuilding in the area dates from 1748.

The modern town of Blyth began to develop in the first quarter of the 18th century. Up until 1716, the land around the Blyth area—the Newsham Estate—was owned by the Earls of Derwentwater, but when the third Earl, James Radclyffe, was executed for his part in the Jacobite rising of 1715, the land was forfeited to the crown. On 11 July 1723, the Lordship of Newsham was put up for sale by the Commissioners of Forfeited Estates at their office in the Inner Temple, London. The land was bought by Matthew White and his brother-in-law Richard Ridley. From the 12th century, most port activities were on the north side of the river, but under White and Ridley the first new quays and houses were built on the south side, and from here the port began to prosper. By 1730, a coaling quay, a ballast quay, a pilots&#x27; watch house and a lighthouse had all been built at Blyth harbour. In 1765 the first breakwater was constructed, and in 1788 the first staith with an elevated loading point was erected.

Deep mines were sunk at Cowpen Colliery and Cowpen Square in 1796 and 1804 respectively, and by 1855, a quarter of a million tons of coal was being shipped from Blyth, rising to three million tons by 1900. The only industry not to survive during this prosperous time was the salt trade, which was heavily taxed during the 18th and early-19th centuries. During the Napoleonic Wars, the tax was increased to provide funds for the military and, even though the tax was abolished in 1825, the industry went into terminal decline. Having had fourteen salt pans at the beginning of the 18th century, exporting over 1,000 tons of salt annually, Blyth&#x27;s salt industry closed in 1876, with the destruction of the last salt pan.

At Easter in 1887, William Morris, the poet and interior designer, met and addressed a considerable crowd of striking miners in the market square in Blyth. He spoke for about 40minutes and then led them to Horton. They swelled the numbers there to around 6,0007,000 where Morris spoke again. They had been forced to take a 12.5% pay cut but according to &quot;The Newcastle Chronicle&quot; Morris said &quot;But let them remember that they were many and the Masters few. Masters could only attack with a certain instrument and what was that instrument? A part of the working classes themselves&quot;by which he meant the police.
From the mid-19th century, several important events occurred which allowed the port of Blyth to rapidly expand. First, in 1847, a railway line was constructed, connecting Blyth to collieries at Seghill. In 1853, the Blyth Harbour and Docks Board was formed, then in 1858 the Harbour Act was passed allowing dredging of the harbour to begin. In 1882, the formation of the Blyth Harbour Commission led to the building of new coal loading staiths, as well as the construction of the South Harbour.

As trade in Blyth continued to grow, so did the population. Development of the Cowpen Quay and Waterloo areas began in about 1810 and 1815 respectively, and between the 1850s and 1890s major house building took place in these areas. Blyth railway station, first built in 1847, was relocated in 1867 and rebuilt in 1896, to cope with the increase in goods and passenger traffic. The 1890s saw the filling in of &quot;the Slake&quot; (also known as &quot;the Flanker&quot; or &quot;the Gut&quot;). The Slake was a tidal inlet which stretched south from the river, across the site of today&#x27;s bus station, along the route of Beaconsfield Street, and on past Crofton Mill Pit. Before it was filled in, it almost entirely separated Blyth from Cowpen—Waterloo Bridge providing the only main link. Once it was removed, the two areas could combine and allow the town to begin to take its present form. The town continued to expand in the 20th century; much large-scale house building took place in the 1920s and 1930s, and from the 1950s to the 1970s.

Industry in Blyth reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. At this time it boasted one of the largest shipbuilding yards on the North East coast, with five dry docks and four building slipways. During the First and Second World Wars, the Blyth shipyards built many ships for the Royal Navy including the first aircraft carrier, HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; in 1914. Blyth also served as a submarine base during both wars. Blyth was bombed a number of times during World War II. Landmarks such as the railway station (now Morrisons), the Wallaw Cinema (now Wetherspoons), and houses took damage. By 1930, the port of Blyth was exporting 5.5 million tons of coal, and by the early 1960s, reached its peak with over six million tons. Blyth A and Blyth B power stations, collectively known as Blyth Power Station, were opened in 1958 and 1962. Blyth A was the first power station in Britain to have 120 megawatt sets installed, while Blyth B was the first to be fitted with 275 megawatt sets.

During the 1960s, Blyth entered a period of steep decline. Following the Beeching report, the railway into Blyth was closed in 1965; and in 1966, economic depression resulted in the closure of the shipyards. As the demand for coal fell, due to the increasing use of oil, natural gas and nuclear power as energy sources, the following years saw the closure of many collieries in the area. By the 1980s, the only one left in the town was Bates&#x27; Pit, which closed in 1986. In January 2002, Blyth Power Station was closed and demolished in stages, and on 7 December 2003, its four chimneys were felled.

== Governance ==

From around the first quarter of the 18th century, until November 1900, the land to the south of the River Blyth was known as South Blyth. It was in the Parish of Earsdon and was run by the Parish Council until 1863, when the South Blyth Local Board was formed. Under the Local Government Act of 1894, South Blyth Local Board became an Urban District Council, then in 1906 it was amalgamated with Cowpen Urban District Council to form Blyth Urban District Council. On 21 September 1922, Blyth UDC became Blyth Municipal Borough Council, and in 1935 its southern boundary was moved south from Meggie&#x27;s Burn to Seaton Burn. Blyth MBC lasted until 1974, when it was amalgamated with Seaton Valley and Cramlington Urban District Councils, as well as part of Whitley Bay Urban District Council, to form Blyth Valley Borough Council.

Blyth was the administrative centre for the borough of Blyth Valley, until the borough was abolished in structural changes to local government on 1 April 2009. Blyth Valley—which also included Cramlington and several villages—was 70 square kilometres in size and, according to the Registrar General&#x27;s Population Estimate for mid-2005, it had a population of 81,600; this gives a population density of 1,166 people per square kilometre. The two-tier local government of Northumberland County Council and Blyth Valley Borough Council has been replaced by a unitary authority for the county of Northumberland. Blyth is situated in the parliament constituency of Blyth Valley, which shares its boundaries with the borough. It is divided up into twenty wards, nine of which—Cowpen, Croft, Isabella, Kitty Brewster, Newsham and New Delaval, Plessey, South Beach, South Newsham, and Wensleydale—make up the town of Blyth.

Blyth is represented in the House of Commons, as part of the Blyth and Ashington constituency, by Ian Lavery of the Labour Party.

Blyth is twinned with Solingen, Germany. As part of Blyth Valley it was previously also twinned with Ratingen, Germany and Gelendzhik, Russia.

== Geography ==
Blyth is on the coast of North East England, to the south of the River Blyth and is approximately northeast of Newcastle upon Tyne and north of Sunderland. It is east of Bedlington, northeast of Cramlington, south-southeast of Ashington and south of Newbiggin-by-the-Sea. On the north side of the river are the villages of East Sleekburn, Cambois and North Blyth and to the south of the town are the villages of New Hartley, Seaton Delaval and Seaton Sluice. Some of Blyth&#x27;s suburbs have origins which can be traced back much further than the town itself; Newsham, Bebside and Cowpen are all believed to have had habitation sites dating from the Romano-British, Saxon and Medieval periods, although most of the housing in these areas dates from the 19th and 20th centuries. Also occupying the suburbs are several large housing estates; the Newsham Farm, South Beach and Solingen estates, and the Avenues were all developed during the 20th century. In January 2005, the land in Blyth was made up of 61.87% green space, 11.95% domestic gardens, 8.23% road, 4.85% domestic buildings, 2.03% non-domestic buildings, and 11.07% other uses.

The geology of the area is made up of a carboniferous bedrock of sandstone, mudstone, and coal, which is covered mainly by boulder clay and till.

In October 2023 the sand at Blyth promenade beach was washed away by Storm Ciarán.

=== Climate ===
The climate in Northumberland is generally cool and dry. Compared with the rest of the United Kingdom, the weather there is relatively stable, and extreme conditions, such as floods, droughts, or heatwaves, are rare. Below are the average maximum and minimum temperatures, and average rainfall recorded between 1971 and 2000 at the Met Office weather station in Boulmer, which is around 33 kilometres (21 mi) north of Blyth.
The average maximum temperatures between April and October are around 1–2½ °C lower than the national average and the average minimum temperatures between May and August are around ½ °C below the national average; both the average maximum and minimum temperatures for the remainder of the year are about the same as the national average. The average rainfall in Northumberland is well below the national average; 651 millimetres (26 in) was recorded at Boulmer, compared to 838 millimetres (33 in) for the whole of England.

== Transport==
The main approach road to Blyth is the A189 Spine Road which is accessible from the A1 via the A19. The A193 is the main road through Blyth and leads to Bedlington to the west and North Tyneside to the south. The other main route into Blyth is the A1061. Blyth bus station is located in Post Office Square in the town centre. Buses in Blyth are operated by Arriva North East and there are regular services to Newcastle as well as the other main towns in the south of Northumberland and the surrounding areas of Blyth. One service is operated by Go North East.

Blyth has no current passenger rail links – the nearest station is Cramlington (). Blyth railway station was closed on 2 November 1964 following the Beeching Report. There were also two small stations on the outskirts of the town, at Bebside and Newsham; they were closed to passenger services in 1956 and 1964 respectively.

The Northumberland Line project is reopening a passenger rail service to Newsham by 2024.

==Port of Blyth==
The Port of Blyth was first recorded from 1138, when monks at Newminster Abbey exported salt, having created it from pans on the north side of the river and evaporated using the copious supplies of local coal. Coal exports started from the 14th century, with local mines recorded from the 16th century. In 1609 21,571 tons of coal were shipped from Blyth. The first large quay – Bishop&#x27;s Quay, which still exists today – was developed by 1682. But the port was not dredged at this time, necessitating the use of Northumbrian keel boats to transfer the loads to ships moored offshore. By 1730 specific coaling and ballast quays existed, and by 1765 the ports facilities included a pilot house and lighthouse, to facilitate the newly built first breakwater, North Dyke. The High Lighthouse came into operation soon afterwards, operating until July 1984.

The port expanded greatly in the 19th century, with the purchase of a steam tug in 1819, and the rebuilding of the breakwater in 1822. By this point, three ship building yards had also been established. The construction of the Blyth and Tyne Railway from 1849 allowed coal shipments to quickly expand, reaching 200,000 tons per annum. The Blyth Harbour and Dock Company was created in 1854, but with need for further expansion, it was replaced by a bill of parliament given Royal Assent on 19 June 1882, which constituted the current Blyth Harbour Commission. This allowed additional financing to be raised, for construction of the South Harbour.

By the 20th century, through connection via the London and North Eastern Railway which had leased large amounts of land throughout the port, Blyth had started the growth to become the Europe&#x27;s largest coal export port, exporting 5.5M tonnes per year by the late 1930s. This was also supplemented by ship building, including the opening of a facility by Hughes, Bolckow and Co of Middlesbrough. Large scale shipbuilding had begun in 1811, and after passing through various hands, in 1880 the first two iron ships were built at Blyth for the Russian Government. This led to the foundation of the Blyth Shipbuilding Company on 2 March 1883, building cargo liners, tramp steamers and colliers. With a cargo ship under construction, in 1914 she was purchased by the Admiralty and converted into the Navy&#x27;s first seaplane carrier . The company returned to commercial ship building, but collapsed in 1925. It was then revived from 1926, but after merger with other local yards and in light of the Wall Street crash and resultant global recession, collapsed again in 1930. Reopened under its original name in 1937, it built various ships in preparation for and during WW2, including the former German cargo ship &quot;Hannover&quot; which was converted into the escort carrier . Owned by Mollers (Hong Kong) Ltd post-WW2, it then built cargo-liners for Moller&#x27;s subsidiary the Lancashire Shipping Company. The construction yard closed in 1967, with only repair work and ship dismantling sustaining business until the yards were demolished in the late 1980s to make room for a paper and timber storage area.

After World War 2, whilst most ports began to quickly contract, Blyth was still a major facility through the 1960s, when coal exports reached over 6 M tonnes per year. However, with the closure Blyth&#x27;s last ship builder in 1966, the port began a significant period of contraction. The employment slack was in part taken up by the construction of the coal-fired Blyth Power Station, located on the northern bank. of the river. The A Station with 480 megawatts (MW) of capacity first generated electricity in 1958, a year after the creation of the Central Electricity Generating Board, and the B Station with a capacity of 1,250 MW four years later. The power stations&#x27; four large chimneys were a landmark of the Northumberland skyline for over 40 years; the A Station&#x27;s two chimneys each stood at ; the B Station&#x27;s two chimneys were taller, at each. They were operated by the successors of the CEGB, including National Power, following the privatisation of the UK&#x27;s power industry. After their closure in 2001, the stations were demolished over the course of two years, ending with the demolition of the stations&#x27; chimneys on 7 December 2003. The establishment of an Alcan aluminium smelting facility in the 1970s north along the river slowed this decline, as did the import of paper from Finland.

In 1997, The Port established Transped, the ports packing business. It has since diversified into logistics areas including import and export packing, customer depot facilities, distribution and storage, ships agency and European and worldwide forwarding.

Today, the Port of Blyth handles up to 1.5 million tonnes of cargo, mainly containers and RoRo, and some limited volumes of bulk cargos. A2B, a Dutch container company, operate twice-weekly shipping services to the Netherlands in partnership with Transped connecting the port to Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

== Economy ==
=== Industry and commerce ===
With the running down of the coal mining and shipbuilding industries, Blyth largely exists today as a dormitory town in the commuter belt serving Newcastle and North Tyneside. However, its port still remains a major industry in the area, handling over 1.5 million tonnes of cargo annually. Its main trades are forest products, such as paper, pulp and timber, unitised cargo (containers and RoRo), and the import of materials used in the production of aluminium. It also handles the import of a variety of stones and metals. A twice weekly container service between the port and Moerdijk, near Rotterdam, provides connections with the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and France as well as South America and the Far East. The port is operated by Port of Blyth, which is the operating division of Blyth Harbour Commission. Port of Blyth is a trust port, which means that it is governed by its own local legislation under the control of an independent board; there are no shareholders and therefore no dividends to support, which allows any surplus to be reinvested in the port.

===Energy===

====Renewables====
Several renewable energy projects have been established in Blyth. In 1992, Blyth Harbour Wind Farm was constructed along Blyth&#x27;s East Pier. Consisting of nine wind turbines and with a maximum capacity of 2.7 megawatts, it can provide enough electricity for over 1,500 homes. It was joined in December 2000 by Blyth Offshore Wind Farm, which was composed of two turbines situated 1 kilometre (0.6 mi) out to sea. These was the UK&#x27;s first two offshore wind turbines. At 2 megawatts each, they were also, when installed, the largest in the world. The wind farm was decommissioned in 2019 by plant owner E.ON. E.ON also commissioned 5 new wind turbines in 2017. These turbines produce 8.3 megawatts of power each, for a combined total of 41.5 megawatts, powering 36,000 homes.

The National Renewable Energy Centre (Narec) is one of five centres of excellence set up by the North East&#x27;s regional development agency, One NorthEast. It was established in 2002 and is based at Eddie Ferguson House, by the Quayside. Its purpose is to develop and test new energy technologies and equipment that will assist in the transition to a low-carbon economy.

====Proposed clean coal power station====

On 11 May 2007, proposals for a £2 billion clean coal power station were announced by energy supplier RWE npower. If the plans go ahead, it is estimated that 1,500 jobs will be created for the construction, with another 200 full-time staff required for the running of the plant, which would open in 2014 on the site of the old power station. The development would see the installation of three 800 megawatt coal-fired units, which would generate enough energy to supply around 3.5 million homes. These plans have, however, met some opposition; many residents living in the area feel that the land should be redeveloped for other purposes, rather than continue to be used as an industrial site. The MP for Wansbeck, Denis Murphy, stated that, although the project would have benefits for the area, he still had concerns; Ronnie Campbell, the MP for Blyth Valley, claimed he would welcome the development as long as it did not have an adverse effect on the overall regeneration of the area.

====Proposed gigafactory, then data centre====

In December 2020, Blyth was confirmed as the location for a new Britishvolt battery manufacturing plant. In July 2021, plans for the £2.6bn gigafactory employing 3,000 people were approved, with the new plant to be located on former coalyards adjacent to the now-demolished power station in Cambois, near Blyth. It was to produce lithium-ion batteries for the automotive industry. Britishvolt appointed ISG as its construction partner who began work on clearing the site in late 2021. In January 2022, the UK government invested £100m in the Britishvolt project, alongside asset management company abrdn and its property investment arm Tritax, developing what was planned to be Britain&#x27;s fourth largest building. However, construction work was halted in August 2022 amid funding concerns, with manufacturing delayed until mid-2025, more than a year later than initially planned. In January 2023, Britishvolt went into administration, and its factory site was put up for sale. In February, Australian firm Recharge Industries announced it had bought Britishvolt out of administration. The takeover related to Britishvolt&#x27;s battery technology not the site, and in March, Northumberland County Council extended a buy-back clause on the Blyth site, giving Britishvolt&#x27;s new owners more time to build the gigafactory. However, the negotiations dragged on into the summer of 2023, amid continued uncertainty surrounding the deal and the finances of Recharge&#x27;s parent, Scale Facilitation.

In April 2024, the site was acquired for construction of a data centre, ending hopes for thousands of manufacturing jobs in the region. However, plans submitted in December 2024 envisaged development of up to 10 data centre buildings totalling up to 540,000sq m, representing an investment of up to £10bn, with 1,200 long-term construction jobs plus employment in the data centres.

===Urban regeneration===
Commercial developments in the town centre have also helped to revitalise Blyth. Opened in 1991, the Keel Row Shopping Centre has brought many large high street retailers to the town. Several streets and many derelict buildings, including the old council offices, were cleared away to make way for the development. Adjacent, is the thrice weekly market which is held on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. On 14 March 2009, the market was officially reopened following a £3 million refurbishment, which involved the installation of new paving, seating, lighting, and a water feature. The centrepiece is an artwork by Simon Watkinson, named Hyperscope; the stainless steel column incorporates lighting effects and represents the town&#x27;s coal mining heritage and history as a wartime submarine base. The aim of the refurbishment is to attract people to the market area when the market is closed, and to bring further investment to the town. However, the project has received criticism; following approval of the proposals in June 2007, concern was raised by Councillor Alisdair Gibbs-Barton, who said that the market place was beginning to resemble a park, and that more trade should be being encouraged. Following the reopening there were also claims that new stalls provided to market traders are unable to withstand adverse weather conditions, and that traders were being overcharged for stall space.

=== Employment ===
The closure of Blyth&#x27;s male-dominated heavy industries during the latter half of the 20th century led to a shift towards more female-dominated light industries, many of which were based on the new Blyth and Kitty Brewster trading estates. At the 2001 UK census, the industries of employment of residents of Blyth were 19.44% manufacturing, 16.82% retail, 11.82% health and social work, 8.83% construction, 8.58% public administration and defence, 8.33% real estate, 6.69% transport and communications, 5.23% education, 4.53% hotels and catering, 3.13% finance, 0.92% utilities, 0.66% agriculture and forestry, 0.65% mining and quarrying, 0.07% fishing, and 4.29% other industries. The census showed that the economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 39.35% in full-time employment, 11.82% in part-time employment, 4.65% self-employed, 5.37% unemployed, 1.57% economically active students, 3.02% economically inactive students, 14.42% retired, 6.89% looking after home or family, 9.69% permanently sick or disabled, and 3.23% economically inactive for other reasons.

== Demography ==
Blyth is the largest town in Northumberland; at the 2011 UK census it had a population of 39,731. There were 16,961 households, of which 16,381 (96.6%) had at least one resident. For every 1000 females there were 948 males. The age distribution was 6.1% 0–4 years, 13.2% 5–15 years, 5.2% 16–19 years, 31.4% 20–44 years, 27.7% 45–64 years, and 16.3% 65 years and over. The average age of the population was 39.7 years. The ethnicity of the town was 97.3% white, 1.1% Asian, 0.5% mixed race, and &lt;0.3% black; other ethnic groups made up the remaining 0.1%. The place of birth of residents was 97.6% United Kingdom, 0.1% Republic of Ireland, 1.0% other European countries, and the remainder being from other countries. Religion was recorded as 62.6% Christian, 0.4% Muslim, 0.2% Sikh, 0.1% Buddhist, 0.1% Hindu, and &lt;0.1% Jewish. &quot;Other religion&quot; was stated by 0.4%, &quot;no religion&quot; was stated by 29.7% (up 16.7% since the 2001 census), and 6.6% did not state a religion. Passports were held by 74.2% of residents; 24.8% reported holding no passport. English was spoken as a main language by 98.8% of households.

== Education ==
Like most of Northumberland, Blyth has a two-tier school system consisting of primary and secondary schools. The town currently has nine primary schools and two secondary schools (The Blyth Academy). Until 2009 it also had five middle schools, but these schools were closed as Northumberland County Council decided to switch to a two-tier system of primary and secondary schools.

The Blyth Academy is one of three high schools in Blyth Valley. Opened on 1 September 2000 as Blyth Community College following the amalgamation of Ridley (formerly Newlands) and Tynedale high schools and built on the site of the latter, it is designed to accommodate 1,450 pupils and also serves as a centre for lifelong learning classes. In the town centre is Northumberland College&#x27;s Blyth centre, as well as the public library, which holds a large collection of local studies resources. As part of a &quot;poverty proofing&quot; initiative, St Wilfrid&#x27;s Primary School banned pencil cases in 2018, as part of a charity initiative to avoid poorer pupils being viewed negatively for lacking designer goods.

Bede Academy, a school for children aged 3 to 18 sponsored by Sir Peter Vardy through the Emmanuel Schools Foundation, opened in September 2009. Bede Academy is built on the former grounds of Ridley High School (formerly Newlands).
The school was formed with an engineering and enterprise specialism in mind, to
complement Blyth&#x27;s historic industrial roots.
In October 2022, the school appeared in an episode of the BBC programme We are England – Educating Blyth. The episode followed the daily life of four students at home, at school and at the workplace, as they endeavour to become the engineers of the future and contribute to Blyth&#x27;s resurgence as a modern industrial powerhouse.

The Dales School is a special needs school. In July 2021, it received a Class 144 train. In April 2019, Blyth won a government bid to establish a 80-place special school for children with specific learning difficulties. The proposed site is the former Princess Louise First School.

In October, Blyth was awarded government funding to establish mental health support teams in schools. The scheme, which requires the county&#x27;s mental health services to see children within four weeks of referral, is planned to be rolled out by December 2020.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from either the Pontop Pike or Chatton TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Newcastle, Capital North East, Heart North East, Smooth North East, Greatest Hits Radio North East, Hits Radio North East and Koast Radio, a community based radio station which broadcast on 106.6 FM.

The town is served by the local newspapers, Northumberland Gazette (formerly The News Post Leader) and Evening Chronicle.

== Entertainment and leisure ==
=== Events and venues ===
Since 2014, Blyth Town Council has organised the &quot;Northumberland Live Festival&quot; every year in June on a meadow right next to the North Sea beach. It offers numerous attractions such as music performances, fairground rides and children&#x27;s entertainment. In addition to local bands and bands from the twintown of Solingen, nationally renowned bands such as The Christians, The Lightning Seeds, The Pigeon Detectives, Toploader, Doctor &amp; the Medics, Scouting for Girls and The Undertones have also performed here. Audience numbers have been as high as 18,000.

The Blyth Town Christmas Fayre is also held in the market place and features a similar range of family entertainment. Close to the town centre is an intimate, 299-seat theatre called the Phoenix Theatre. It presents a regular programme of professional performing arts to the local community and has successfully brought amateur and professional practitioners alongside each other to develop work for the community. There were once four cinemas in Blyth, but the last of these, the Wallaw, closed in 2004. The others – The Central, The Essoldo, and The Roxy – all closed in the 1960s and 1970s.

=== Sport and recreation ===
The town is home to the non-League football club, Blyth Spartans. Founded in 1899, and play their home games at Croft Park. They are notable for their &quot;giant-killing&quot; feats in the FA Cup, particularly those of the 1977–78 season, when they reached the fifth round. The town&#x27;s other non-League football club is Blyth Town, who were established in 1995 and play in the Wade Associates Northern Alliance Premier Division. Also based in Blyth are Blyth Cricket Club and Blyth RFC. Blyth Cricket Club was formed in 1883 and presently compete in the Northumberland &amp; Tyneside Cricket League Division 3. Blyth Cricket Club were Northumberland &amp; Tyneside Cricket League Division 4 champions in the 2020 season and Northumberland Premier League champions in 2017.

Blyth Sports Centre offers a wide range of facilities including two swimming pools, a sports hall, squash courts, fitness suite, saunas, outdoor skate park, and more. Blyth Golf Club is situated on the outskirts of the town at New Delaval, and has an 18-hole course with a par of 72. Royal Northumberland Yacht Club has its headquarters in the South Harbour. RNYC offers crewing and sailing opportunities and is a Royal Yachting Association Training Centre for sail cruising and powerboating for its members.

=== Parks and open spaces ===
Ridley Park was created on land handed over by Viscount Matthew White Ridley and was opened on 27 July 1904. In June 2005, a £602,000 regeneration project was completed, which saw the installation of a children&#x27;s water play area and upgrading of existing play facilities at the southern end of the park. The Quayside is a stretch of the riverfront that was once a centre of Blyth&#x27;s industry, where coal would be loaded from trains onto ships for export, but having undergone major redevelopment, it is now a clean and peaceful area. Notable features of the Quayside include the &quot;Spirit of the Staithes&quot; sculpture and eleven &quot;solar sound posts&quot; which, when approached, replay pre-recorded stories relating to the port told by local people.

Blyth&#x27;s largest and most natural open space is its beach and sand dunes, which stretch from the mouth of the river to Seaton Sluice. The dunes were declared a Local Nature Reserve by Blyth Valley Borough Council in December 2003, and are also an area of Special Nature Conservation Interest. They are notable for their diverse range of plant life, butterflies, moths, and birds, as well as being one of only two coastal locations in the country inhabited by both species of banded land snail—&quot;Cepaea nemoralis&quot; and &quot;Cepaea hortensis&quot;.

== Landmarks and places of interest ==

The &quot;Spirit of the Staithes&quot; sculpture on Blyth&#x27;s Quayside was unveiled by Princess Anne on 28 May 2003. As part of the overall regeneration of the Quayside, it was commissioned by Blyth Valley Council in conjunction with Northern Arts and created by the artist Simon Packard. Standing 15 metres (50 ft) high and 7 metres (22 ft) wide, it represents the heritage of coal distribution in Europe, an industry in which Blyth was the largest exporter.

The &quot;High Light&quot; lighthouse is one of Blyth&#x27;s oldest structures. It stands to the rear of Bath Terrace and is tall. Built in three stages, the first section was constructed in 1788 to a height of ; a further was added in 1888, and the final was added in 1900. The original oil-fired lamp had a range of ; it was upgraded to gas in 1857 and electricity in 1932. Prior to land reclamation in the late 19th century, the lighthouse had been much closer to the quayside. At some stage it became the rear of a pair of leading lights, and known as the &#x27;High Light&#x27;; the corresponding &#x27;low light&#x27; has long since been demolished. Blyth High Light was deactivated in 1985 and listed Grade II on 15 July 1987.

Before their demolition, the four chimneys of Blyth Power Station dominated the landscape along the coast. Two were high, the other two were high, and they were visible for many miles.

On the north side of the River Blyth are the remains of the railway coal staithes which featured in the chase scene at the end of the 1971 film &quot;Get Carter&quot;, starring Michael Caine.

<doc id="435566" wikidata="Q1582860" url="?curid=435566" title="I Shot Andy Warhol">
<text>I Shot Andy Warhol is a 1996 biographical drama film about Valerie Solanas&#x27; life and her relationship with Andy Warhol. The film marked the feature film directorial debut of the Canadian director Mary Harron. The film stars Lili Taylor as Valerie, Jared Harris as Andy Warhol, and Martha Plimpton as Valerie&#x27;s friend Stevie. Stephen Dorff plays Warhol superstar Candy Darling. John Cale of the Velvet Underground wrote the film&#x27;s score despite protests from former band member Lou Reed. Yo La Tengo plays an anonymous band that is somewhat reminiscent of the group.

The film was screened in the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Teddy Awards, the film was selected to be shown at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016.

==Plot==
The film opens immediately after her attempted assassination of Andy Warhol at The Factory in 1968, followed by Valerie Solanas being shown in custody for the attack. The film then uses flashbacks to when Valerie was living in New York as a sex worker, then to her difficult childhood, then to her success in studying psychology at college. Here, Valerie discovers that she is a lesbian, that she can write, and that she has a distinctive view of the world. This leads her to New York City and its downtown underworld. Through her friend Stevie, she meets Candy Darling, who in turn introduces her to Warhol.

Valerie also meets Maurice Girodias, the publisher of Olympia Press. While Valerie wants Warhol to produce her play, &quot;Up Your Ass&quot;, Girodias wants her to write a pornographic novel for him. The group steals her manuscript and lies about it, saying it was lost. Once she signs a contract with Girodias, she comes to suspect his offer is not a generous one and may not be in her best interest. She comes to regret signing this contract. At this point, her increasing derangement leads her to believe that Warhol and Girodias are controlling her. The film concludes, where it began, with Solanas&#x27; attempted murder of Warhol. Warhol lives in fear that Valerie will strike again and never fully recovers from the shooting. The &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; becomes a feminist classic.

==Cast==
==Background==
Initially intended as a BBC documentary, the film was directed by Mary Harron who also co-wrote the screenplay with Daniel Minahan.

Dr. Dana Heller, Dean of Arts and Sciences at Eastern Michigan University, argues that the film stages the conflict between Solanas and Warhol as less the result of gender politics – particularly because Solanas intended no connection between her writing and the shooting – than of the decline of print culture as represented by Solanas and the rise of new non-writing media as embodied by Warhol and the pop art movement. In the screenplay, Harron and Minahan describe Solanas as &quot;banging at an ancient typewriter&quot; and the film frequently shows her typing, for which she is mocked by Warhol and other Factory regulars. Solanas&#x27; writing is set against the new technologies of reproduction championed by Warhol.

Many people who knew Solanas and Warhol tried to rationalize the shooting. Stephen Koch, who in 1973 wrote a study of Warhol&#x27;s film, stated: &quot;Valerie lives in terror of dependence: That is what the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; is about, an absolute terror before the experience of need. Like Warhol, Solanas is obsessed with an image of autonomy, except that... she has played the obsession desperately, rather than with Warhol&#x27;s famous cool.&quot;

==Reception==
Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 77% of 31 critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. On Metacritic, it has a weighted score of 75/100, based on 20 critics, denoting &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

<text>Sir Eric Matthew Gairy PC (18 February 192223 August 1997) was the first Prime Minister of Grenada, serving from his country&#x27;s independence in 1974 until his overthrow in a coup by Maurice Bishop in 1979. Gairy also served as head of government in pre-independence Grenada as Chief Minister from 1961 to 1962 and as Premier from 1967 to 1974.

== Early days in Grenada: 1922–41 ==
Eric Matthew Gairy was the son of Douglas and Theresa Gairy, and was born 18 February 1922 in Dunfermline, St. Andrew&#x27;s Parish on the eastern side of the island near Grenville, Grenada. He attended the LaFillette School and then the St. Andrews Roman Catholic Senior School. He was also an acolyte at St. Andrew&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, next door to the school. He became a primary &quot;student-teacher&quot; in the LaFillette School from January 1939 to September 1941. He moved to Aruba where he worked several years in the oil refinery of the Lago Oil and Transport Company.

== Trade union leader and &quot;Sky Red&quot;: 1950–51 ==
Eric Gairy returned to Grenada in December, 1949 to enter trade unionism and politics. In 1950 he founded the Grenada Manual &amp; Mental Workers Union (GMMWU) and was deeply involved in encouraging the 1951 general strike for better working conditions. This sparked great unrest - so many buildings were set ablaze that the disturbances became known as the &quot;Sky Red&quot; days - and the British authorities had to call in military reinforcements to help regain control of the situation. Gairy himself was taken into custody.

== Radical political leader: 1951–61 ==
In 1950, Gairy founded the Grenada United Labour Party. He was elected as a representative of the Colony of Grenada&#x27;s Legislative Council in 1951, 1954, and 1957. He was banned from political activities and lost his seat between 1957 and 1961.

== Chief Minister: 1961–62 ==
Gairy was returned in a by-election in July 1961 and became Chief Minister, as his party held a majority in the Legislative Council since winning the 1961 general election. He served as Chief Minister and Minister of Finance from August 1961 until April 1962 when he was dismissed by the British colonial Governor for the questionable use of state funds.

== Leader of the Opposition: 1962–67 ==
Gairy&#x27;s party lost the 1962 general election and he served as leader of the opposition between 1962 and 1967.

== Premier: 1967–74 ==

=== First administration: 1967–72 ===
Gairy won the 1967 general election and formed a new administration as Premier of the Associated State of Grenada.

=== Miss World controversy ===
In the 1970 Miss World pageant in London, controversy followed after Grenadian contestant Jennifer Hosten won (the first-ever black Miss World), and another black contestant from South Africa placed second. Since Gairy was on the judging panel, inevitably there were many accusations that the contest had been rigged. The BBC and newspapers received numerous protests about the result, and accusations of racism were made by all sides. Four of the nine judges had given first-place votes to Miss Sweden, Marjorie Christel Johansson, while Miss Grenada received only two firsts, yet Johansson finished fourth. Some of the audience gathered in the street outside Royal Albert Hall after the contest and chanted &quot;Swe-den, Swe-den&quot;. Four days later, organising director Julia Morley resigned because of the intense pressure from the newspapers. Years later, Johansson was reported as saying that she had been cheated out of the title.

=== Second administration 1972–74 ===
Gairy won the 1972 general election and formed a new administration as Premier of the Associated State of Grenada.

== Prime Minister: 1974–79 ==

=== First administration: 1974–76 ===
Gairy became the first Prime Minister of Grenada when Grenada achieved independence from Great Britain on 7 February 1974. Gairy&#x27;s term in office coincided with civil strife in Grenada. The political environment was highly charged, with Gairy&#x27;s secret police, the Mongoose Gang, terrorizing opponents.

=== Second administration: 1976–79 ===
Gairy&#x27;s party narrowly won the 1976 election but the result was declared fraudulent by international observers due to intimidation of the opposition by the Mongoose Gang.

On 27 November 1978, Eric Gairy led a group including scientists and an astronaut in addressing the United Nations on the subject of UFOs.

US citizens helped to support the overthrow of Eric Gairy with solidarity movements. One such solidarity movement existed in San Antonio, Texas and was headed by African-American activist Mario Marcel Salas, who was active in his overthrow on a number of levels. Civil strife took the form of street violence between government supporters, including the Mongoose Gang, and gangs organized by the New Jewel Movement (NJM). In the late 1970s, the NJM began planning to overthrow the government, with party members receiving military training outside of Grenada.

In 1979, a rumour circulated that Gairy would use the Gang to eliminate leaders of the New Jewel Movement while he was out of the country. In response, Bishop overthrew Gairy in March of that year while the latter was visiting the United States.

On 13 March 1979, while Gairy was at the UN for further discussions on UFOs, the New Jewel Movement led by Maurice Bishop launched a bloodless coup and overthrew the government. Bishop suspended the constitution, and the New Jewel Movement ruled the country with mass support from the population until 1983. Anti-Gairy activity was carried out in the United States in support of the revolution to overthrow Gairy, including activists in San Antonio, Texas.

== Exile in the United States: 1979–83 ==
Gairy stayed in exile in the United States until 1983, when the United States, backed by some Caribbean allies – notably, Dame Eugenia Charles, Prime Minister of Dominica and Edward Seaga, Prime Minister of Jamaica – invaded to topple a military government which had overthrown and killed Bishop.

== Return and final days: 1983–97 ==
Gairy then returned to Grenada and campaigned in the elections of 1984, claiming to be a changed man. However, his party lost the elections, winning 36% of the popular vote but only a single seat in the House of Representatives. Attempts by Gairy and his party to return to power in 1990 and 1995 were also unsuccessful.

On June 7, 1996, while Gairy was in Venezuela, he suffered a stroke and had to be hospitalized. The following year on August 23, he died at his home in Grand Anse, Grenada. He was 75.

<doc id="435573" wikidata="Q468234" url="?curid=435573" title="Maurice Bishop">
<text>Maurice Rupert Bishop (29 May 1944 – 19 October 1983) was a Grenadian revolutionary and the leader of the New Jewel Movement (NJM) – a Marxist–Leninist party that sought to prioritise socio-economic development, education and black liberation. The NJM came to power during the 13 March 1979 revolution which removed Prime Minister Eric Gairy from office. Bishop headed the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government of Grenada (PRG) from 1979 to 1983. In October 1983 he was deposed as Prime Minister and executed during a coup engineered by Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard. This quickly led to the demise of the PRG.

== Early life ==
Maurice Rupert Bishop was born on 29 May 1944 on the island of Aruba, then a colony of the Netherlands as part of the Territory of Curaçao. His parents, Rupert and Alimenta Bishop, came from the northeast of Grenada, where Rupert earned only five British pence per day. At the end of 1930, to improve his financial position, Rupert moved with his wife Alimenta to Aruba so that he could work in the oil refinery.

Until the age of six, Maurice was raised in Aruba with two older sisters, Ann and Maureen. In 1950 his father took the family back to Grenada and opened a small retail shop in the capital, St. George&#x27;s. Maurice was sent to study at the Wesleyan elementary school, but after a year Maurice was transferred to the Roman Catholic St George primary and high school. Maurice was already quite tall at age nine and was teased because his height made him look much older. As an only son, Maurice was pushed hard by his father to excel. Rupert demanded perfect grades from Maurice, not 95 but 100%. When the family purchased a car, his mother expected him to walk to school like the others.

For his secondary education, Bishop received one of the four government scholarships for study at the Roman Catholic Presentation Brothers&#x27; College. He was elected president of the Student Council, of the Discussion Club, and of the History Study Group, along with editing the newspaper &quot;Student Voice&quot; and participating in sports. As he recalled, &quot;Here I had much interest in politics, history and sociology.&quot; He established contacts with students from the Anglican Grenada Boys&#x27; Secondary School, his own school&#x27;s competitors. He was an ardent supporter of the West Indies Federation, established in 1958, and the ideas of Caribbean nationalism. He also recalled the great interest that the 1959 Cuban Revolution aroused in him: &quot;it did not matter what we heard on the radio or read in the colonial press. For us, it comes down to the courage and legendary heroism of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara. ...Nothing could overshadow this aspect of the Cuban Revolution.&quot;

In those same years, Bishop and his colleagues became interested in reading the works of Julius Nyerere and Frantz Fanon. Shortly before graduation, in early 1962, Bishop and Bernard Coard, a youth leader from Grenada Boys&#x27; Secondary School, created the Grenada Assembly of Youth Fighting for Truth. It was intended to raise political awareness among the island&#x27;s youth through lively discussions over pressing issues. Members gathered on Fridays in St. George&#x27;s main square and arranged open political debates among the people. Both friends and enemies celebrated Bishop&#x27;s charisma and oratory skills, including his clever use of humour when making arguments. In 1962, Bishop graduated with a Principal&#x27;s Gold Medal for &quot;outstanding academic and overall ability&quot;.

==Education in England==
The activities of the Grenada Assembly ended the following year when Bishop and the other Assembly leaders left for universities in Europe and the U.S. In December 1963, the 19-year-old Bishop arrived in England to study law at the University of London. Coard meanwhile travelled to the U.S. to study economics at Brandeis University. In 1966, Bishop received a Bachelor of Law degree at Gray&#x27;s Inn in London. He often worked in the city as a postman or vegetable packer. From 1963 to 1966, he was president of the Students Association of Holborn College and in 1967 headed the association of students of the Royal College. While studying Grenadian history, Bishop focused on anti-British speeches and the life of slave revolt leader Julien Fédon, the head of the 1795 uprising. In 1964, Bishop participated in the UK&#x27;s West Indian Standing Conference (WISC) and Campaign Against Racial Discrimination (CARD). He visited socialist Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic. During this period he studied the works of Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. Bishop was particularly impressed by Julius Nyerere&#x27;s &quot;Ujamaa: Essays on Socialism&quot; (published by Oxford University Press in 1968) and the Arusha Declaration of 1967.

From 1967 to 1969, Bishop worked on his thesis, &quot;Constitutional Development of Grenada&quot;. However, he left it unfinished because of disagreements with his thesis supervisor in assessing the 1951 disturbances and general strike in Grenada. In 1969, he received a law degree and became one of the founders of the Legal Aid Office of the West Indies community in London&#x27;s Notting Hill Gate. This was volunteer work; his main source of income came from his job in the civil service as a surtax examiner. During his education in England, Bishop corresponded with Grenadian friends and developed a two-year plan of action upon his return home. The plan called for temporary withdrawal from his lawyer duties in order to co-create an organization capable of taking power on the island.

== Return to Grenada and further political career ==
Returning to Grenada in December 1970, Bishop provided legal defence for striking nurses at St. George&#x27;s General Hospital, who hoped to improve conditions for patients. He was arrested along with 30 other strike supporters. All were acquitted after a seven-month trial. In 1972, Bishop helped organize a conference in Martinique that strategized actions for liberation movements. The philosophy of Julius Nyerere and his Tanzanian socialism were guiding elements for the Movement for Assemblies of the People (MAP), which Bishop helped organize after the elections of 1972. Bishop and co-founders Kenrick Radix and Jacqueline Creft were interested in steering MAP toward construction of popular institutions centered in villages, to facilitate broad participation in the country&#x27;s affairs.

In January 1973, MAP merged with the Joint Endeavor for Welfare, Education and Liberation (JEWEL) and the Organization for Revolutionary Education and Liberation (OREL) to form the New Jewel Movement (NJM). Bishop and Unison Whiteman, the founder of JEWEL, were elected NJM&#x27;s Joint Coordinating Secretaries.

=== &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; ===
On 18 November 1973, Bishop and other leaders of the New Jewel Movement were driving in two cars from St George&#x27;s to Grenville, where they were to meet with businessmen of the city. Police officers under Assistant Chief Constable Innocent Belmar overtook Bishop&#x27;s motorcade. Nine people, including Bishop, were captured, arrested and beaten &quot;almost to the point of death&quot; by Belmar&#x27;s police aides and by the paramilitary Mongoose Gang. In prison the arrested men shaved their beards, revealing Bishop&#x27;s broken jaw. 18 November 1973 became known in Grenada as &quot;Bloody Sunday.&quot;

=== &quot;Bloody Monday&quot; ===
Bishop joined a mass demonstration against Prime Minister Gairy on 21 January 1974. As Bishop&#x27;s group returned to Otway House, they were pelted with stones and bottles by Gairy&#x27;s security forces, who also used tear gas. Maurice&#x27;s father Rupert was leading several women and children away from the danger when he was shot in the back and killed at the door of Otway House. The perpetrators were members of the Mongoose Gang who took orders from Gairy and &quot;carried out campaigns of terror ... against the New JEWEL Movement and against the Bishop family in particular.&quot; 21 January 1974 became known in Grenada as &quot;Bloody Monday.&quot;

After this traumatizing event, Bishop said, &quot;we [the NJM] realized that we were unable to lead the working class&quot; since the party had no influence in city workers&#x27; unions or among the rural folk loyal to Gairy. With his colleagues, Bishop developed a new strategy, shifting focus from propaganda and mobilizing anti-government demonstrations toward the organization of party groups and cells.

=== Independence Day ===
On 6 February 1974, the day before the proclamation of the independent state of Grenada, Bishop was arrested on charges of plotting an armed anti-government conspiracy. He was taken to the Fort George prison. Police said that while searching his house they found weapons, ammunition, equipment and uniforms, along with a plan to assassinate Eric Gairy in a nightclub, and a scheme for setting up guerrilla camps. Two days later, Bishop was released on $125 bail, and fled briefly to North America. On 29 March 1974, he was in Guyana participating in a meeting of the Regional Steering Committee of the Pan-African Congress. He also continued his law practice. In October 1974, he defended Desmond &quot;Ras Kabinda&quot; Trotter and Roy Mason who were accused of murdering an American tourist.

=== Leader of the Opposition ===
In 1976, Bishop was elected to represent St. George&#x27;s South-East in Parliament. From 1976 to 1979, he held the position of Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives of Grenada. As such, he challenged the government of Prime Minister Gairy and his Grenada United Labour Party (GULP), which maintained power by threat and intimidation and by fraudulent elections. In May 1977, Bishop made his first visit to Cuba. He travelled there with Unison Whiteman as leaders of the NJM and guests of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with People (ICAP).

== Premiership ==

In 1979 Bishop&#x27;s party staged a revolution and deposed Gairy, who was out of the country addressing the United Nations. Bishop became Prime Minister of Grenada and suspended the constitution.

After taking power, Bishop established a partnership with Cuba. He initiated a number of projects in Grenada, most significantly, the building of a new international airport on the island&#x27;s southern tip (renamed in his memory in May 2009). Financing and labour for the construction of the airport came from Cuba, although most of the airport&#x27;s infrastructure was designed by European and North American consultants. U.S. President Ronald Reagan accused Grenada of intending to use the new airport&#x27;s long &quot;airstrip&quot; as a waypoint for Soviet military aircraft.

Among Bishop&#x27;s core principles were workers&#x27; rights, women&#x27;s rights, and the struggle against racism and apartheid. Under Bishop&#x27;s leadership, the National Women&#x27;s Organization was formed which participated in policy decisions along with other social groups. Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave. Sex discrimination was made illegal. Organisations for education (Centre for Popular Education), health care, and youth affairs (National Youth Organization) were also established. Despite its achievements, Bishop&#x27;s government would not hold elections and stifled the free press and the opposition.

The People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (PRA) was also formed during Bishop&#x27;s administration. Critics claimed that the army was a waste of resources, and there were complaints that the PRA was used as a tool to commit human rights abuses, like detention of political dissidents. The establishment of voluntary mass organizations of women, farmers, youth, workers, and militia were presumed to make the holding of elections unnecessary. Moreover, it was believed that elections could be manipulated by the input of large sums of money from foreign interests.

Bishop has been quoted at length on the dynamics of democracy:
 There are those ... who believe that you cannot have a democracy unless there is a situation where every five years ... people are allowed to put an &quot;X&quot; next to some candidate&#x27;s name, and ... they return to being non-people without the right to say anything to their government, without any right to be involved in running their country. ...Elections could be important, but for us the question is one of timing. ...We would much rather see elections come when the economy is more stable, when the Revolution is more consolidated. When more people have in fact had benefits brought to them. When more people are literate ...The right of freedom of expression can really only be relevant if people are not too hungry, or too tired to be able to express themselves. It can only be relevant if appropriate grassroots mechanisms rooted in the people exist, through which the people can effectively participate. ...We talk about the human rights that the majority has never been able to enjoy, ... a job, to decent housing, to a good meal. ...These human rights have been the human rights for a small minority over the years in the Caribbean and the time has come for the majority of the people to begin to receive those human rights for the first time.&quot;

While Bishop had accomplishments to tout — free public healthcare, a drop in illiteracy from 35% to 5%, a drop in unemployment from 50% to 14% — his weak point was in promoting tourism to the island. He therefore revived the old project of constructing &quot;Grenada&#x27;s first proper international airport&quot; and asked his friend Fidel Castro for help.

In his role as Prime Minister, Bishop travelled abroad to cultivate relations and to inform the world about the Grenada Revolution. In August 1983, he delivered a speech to an enthusiastic audience at Hunter College in Brooklyn, New York. He defended his country&#x27;s revolution, comparing it to the American Revolution and Emancipation Proclamation, and then spoke of &quot;the continued economic subservience of the developing world, of the overthrow of Salvador Allende’s government in Chile, and the brutal Contra interventions against the Sandinistas&quot;. A U.S. State Department report at the time expressed concern with Bishop and the NJM: &quot;The revolution in Grenada, it said, was in some ways even worse than the Cuban Revolution that had rocked the region a quarter of a century earlier: the vast majority of Grenadians were black, and therefore their struggle could resonate with thirty million black Americans; and the Grenadian revolutionary leaders spoke English, and so could communicate their message with ease to an American audience.&quot;

=== Arrest and execution ===
In September 1983, simmering tensions within PRG leadership reached a boiling point. A faction within the party, led by Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard, tried to make Bishop either step down or agree to a power-sharing arrangement. Bishop considered the matter for a couple of weeks, but ultimately rejected the proposal. In response, the Coard faction in conjunction with the PRA placed Bishop under house arrest on 13 October. Large public demonstrations gathered to demand Bishop&#x27;s release and his return to power. The protesters numbered as high as 30,000 on an island of 100,000, and even some of Bishop&#x27;s guards joined the protests. Despite the sizable support, Bishop knew the determination of the Coard faction. He confided to a journalist: &quot;I am a dead man.&quot;

On 19 October, a crowd of protesters managed to free Bishop from house arrest. He made his way, first by truck, then by car, to army headquarters at Fort Rupert (known today as Fort George) which he and his supporters were able to seize control of. At that point, Coard dispatched a military force from Fort Frederick to retake Fort Rupert. Bishop and seven others, including his cabinet ministers and aides, were captured. A four-man PRA firing squad executed Bishop and the others by machine-gunning them in the Fort Rupert courtyard. After he was dead, a gunman slit his throat and cut off his finger to steal his ring. The bodies were transported to a military camp on the peninsula of Calivigny and partially burned in a pit. The location of their remains is still unknown.

Partly as a result of Bishop&#x27;s murder, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the nations of Barbados and Jamaica appealed to the United States for assistance, as did Sir Paul Scoon, Governor-General of Grenada. Within days, President Ronald Reagan launched a U.S.-led invasion to overthrow the PRG.

== Family ==
Maurice Bishop married nurse Angela Redhead in 1966. They had two children, John (born 1967) and Nadia (born 1969). Angela emigrated to Toronto, Canada with both children in 1981 while Maurice was still prime minister. He also fathered a son, Vladimir Lenin Creft-Bishop (1978–1994), with his longtime partner Jacqueline Creft, who was Grenada&#x27;s Minister of Education. Jacqueline was killed alongside Maurice by the Fort Rupert firing squad on 19 October. After his parents&#x27; deaths, Vladimir joined his half-siblings in Canada, but was stabbed to death in a Toronto nightclub at the age of 16.

== Legacy ==

On 29 May 2009, Grenada&#x27;s international airport (formerly Point Salines International Airport) was renamed Maurice Bishop International Airport. Speaking at the ceremony, St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said: &quot;This belated honour to an outstanding Caribbean son will bring closure to a chapter of denial in Grenada&#x27;s history.&quot;

<doc id="435576" wikidata="Q2184291" url="?curid=435576" title="National Labour Organisation">
<text>The National Labour Organisation, also known simply as National Labour, was formed in 1931 by supporters of the National Government in Britain who had come from the Labour Party. Its leaders were Ramsay MacDonald (1931–1937) and his son Malcolm MacDonald (1937–1945).

The most prominent member was the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. National Labour sponsored parliamentary candidates, but did not consider itself a political party as it had no policy distinctive from that of the government which it supported.

After Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s death, the group continued in existence under his son Malcolm until it was wound up on the eve of the 1945 general election; its newsletter ceased publication two years later.

== History ==
=== 1931 general election ===
After Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald formed a National Government with the Conservative and Liberal parties to implement spending cuts rejected by the Labour Party, he and his supporters were expelled from the party. He also received no support from any of the Constituency Labour Parties or major trade unions affiliated with the Trades Union Congress.

The sudden decision to call a general election in October 1931 left MacDonald and the other Labour supporters with the difficult job of organising their own re-elections without any form of organisation. Preparations had been started on 19 September and by early October National Labour supporters had a list of 34 seats which they wanted to fight: 14 out of 15 sitting National Labour MPs wished to fight for re-election and a further ten candidates were ready to stand in other seats. The group thought that a further ten candidates could easily be found.

==== Finance and organisation ====
MacDonald was adamant that National Labour should be separate and not connected to Conservative Central Office. An offer of £100,000 funding from Lord Beaverbrook seems to have been declined, but Sir Alexander Grant gave £250 and the Duke of Westminster gave £2,000 through Maundy Gregory. National Labour had collected £20,000 in total for election expenses. At the start of the election, MacDonald denied Labour Party claims that the funds had come from the Conservative Party. Frank Markham (MacDonald&#x27;s Parliamentary Private Secretary) and the junior minister Earl De La Warr set up a National Labour Committee to run the election. De La Warr became chairman.

==== Candidates ====
Negotiations with Conservative Central Office began after a meeting on 25 September, when the Conservatives had reassured MacDonald that it would not be difficult to come to agreement. Frank Markham then drafted a list of 35 constituencies in which National Labour wanted to stand for election and wanted the Conservatives to support them. However, the Conservatives objected to many of the entries such as Kensington North and Birmingham Erdington, which were marginal former Conservative seats that had only narrowly gone to Labour in 1929. Local Conservatives refused to withdraw their candidates, and in Liverpool Everton, sitting National Labour MP Derwent Hall Caine found himself opposed (and eventually beaten) by a Conservative. By 14 October, with the close of nominations imminent, persistent Conservative associations and candidates had forced National Labour candidates to withdraw in four constituencies and there were only 25 candidates confirmed, 10 of whom had Conservative opposition.

MacDonald himself tried to intervene and on the day after the election was announced complained that Attorney-General Sir William Jowitt had been forced out of Preston and the Conservatives could not find a local association willing to accept him. Jowitt subsequently stood and lost as a National Labour candidate for Combined English Universities. He later rejoined the Labour Party and would end up in Clement Attlee&#x27;s 1945–1951 government as Lord High Chancellor.

Conservative Party chairman Lord Stonehaven complained back to MacDonald about his promotion of &quot;unknown candidates introduced at the very last moment by yourself&quot; competing against Conservatives who had promised him their support, which risked handing the seats to the opposition.

Of the 20 candidates actually nominated, six faced a rival Conservative candidate and one a rival Liberal National. Three more candidates withdrew before polling day. The general organisation of National Labour during the election was run by Benjamin Musgrave. In the 1931 United Kingdom general election 13 were returned as National Labour MPs.

=== Creation of the organisation ===
In December, MacDonald&#x27;s private secretary Herbert Usher wrote a long memorandum asking key questions about what type of ongoing organisation was needed. Usher stated that MacDonald needed to answer three crucial questions: first, whether he wanted to form a new party; second, whether he envisaged returning to the Labour Party; and third, whether the National Government would continue for a long time and produce a single party of the centre. Usher argued that it was not possible to create a distinctive National Labour Party because any distinctive policy would threaten the unity of the National Government coalition. He also contended that MacDonald could not return to the Labour Party, which harboured extreme bitterness about the manner in which the National Government was formed. Usher concluded that the public favoured a large centrist party, but that existing political organisations would not permit it.

Early in 1932 a constitution and organisation was established and the monthly &quot;News-Letter&quot; set up for supporters which was edited by Clifford Allen. An editorial in the first edition written by Allen emphasised that the &quot;News-Letter&quot; was &quot;intended to be a means of contact between Labour supporters of the National Government&quot;, but also &quot;begs the attention of public opinion&quot;, The editorship was later taken by Godfrey Elton and both Allen and Elton received peerages from MacDonald. In September 1932, William Spofforth (formerly the Labour Party agent in Westhoughton) was appointed as secretary.

Philip Snowden, who as Chancellor of the Exchequer had been second only to MacDonald in becoming a prominent Labour member of the National Government, remained nominally one of the National Labour cabinet members after the election, having received a Peerage. However, Snowden rejected an invitation from Clifford Allen to write for the &quot;News-Letter&quot;, replying scathingly and declaring that &quot;I really do not understand this National Labour Party&quot;. When Snowden resigned from the government in opposition to the protectionist outcome of the Ottawa Conference in September 1932, he declared that he no longer had any party allegiance.

=== Relations with the Conservatives ===
After the election, MacDonald persisted in trying to find a seat for Jowitt. All that Stonehaven would offer was Nottingham South, where the Conservative Association might be persuaded to support Jowitt if the sitting National Labour member George Wilfrid Holford Knight stood down. Unexpectedly, Holford Knight refused to comply and MacDonald was angry not with him, but the Conservatives for not offering a seat that they held. In July 1932, a by-election arose in Wednesbury, a seat that Labour had held at every election except 1931. De La Warr expressed to Stonehaven the hope that the local Conservatives would accept a National Labour candidate, but Stonehaven wrote back that the suggestion amazed him. He had tried, but the Wednesbury Conservative Association were obdurate in refusing to have a National Labour candidate, which would mean handing over their organisation and funding the campaign. MacDonald may have considered resigning, but he decided only to refuse to send a message of support to the Conservative, who ended up losing the seat to Labour anyway.

In its publicity, National Labour was concerned to stress that although Parliament was heavily dominated by the Conservatives, the cabinet was much more evenly balanced between the parties.

In 1933, a local electoral pact was agreed in Finsbury between National Labour and the Municipal Reform Party in advance of the 1934 London County Council election. The Parliamentary constituency had a National Labour MP, but the two London County Council seats were held by Labour and the pact agreed that Kenneth Lindsay would run in conjunction with one Municipal Reform candidate in the election. In the event, Michael Franklin of National Labour and Fordham Flower of Municipal Reform stood as National Municipal candidates, but they failed to win seats.

=== Policy and publicity ===
While National Labour could not advocate any policy in opposition to the National Government, its members gave policy suggestions and argued in support of government policy. A pamphlet, called &quot;On the Home Front&quot; and published in April 1934, outlined the National Labour argument in support of the National Government&#x27;s domestic policy—it argued that the agricultural policy followed by the government had &quot;the characteristic Conservative policy of a tariff&quot; as well as &quot;the characteristic Socialist State organisation of industry&quot; and therefore showed what the government &quot;owes to the traditional doctrines of not one, but all, Parties in the State&quot;. The pamphlet asserted that returning to the old party system would mean weak government and that it was weak government that had led other European countries to dictatorship.

Looking back on the politics of the 1930s in a 1964 article, Professor Arthur Marwick regarded National Labour&#x27;s significance as being &quot;a central point around which people who desired political agreement could cohere&quot;. He noted that National Labour could attract to collectivist socialism, some who were put off by the resolutely working-class character of the Labour Party and cited Harold Nicolson as a case in point.

In April 1935, a volume of essays by five leading National Labour politicians was published under the title &quot;Towards a National Policy: being a National Labour Contribution&quot;. MacDonald contributed a preface in which he argued that the Labour opposition &quot;is as little guided by Socialist opinion and inspired by the fine human spirit of our British Socialism as any other political party of pure expediency striving for a majority&quot;. Lord Elton argued that trade unions should not affiliate to the Labour Party because they could achieve more by bargaining for support when not tied to one political party.

=== 1935 general election ===
MacDonald remained Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government until June 1935, when he gave way to Stanley Baldwin and became instead Lord President of the Council. At the 1935 general election, the party sponsored 20 candidates, eight of whom were elected. A notable new recruit was Harold Nicolson, a former diplomat and an ex-political associate of Oswald Mosley when he created the New Party. Immediately after the election, the &quot;News-Letter&quot; argued that Labour supporters of the National Government were hidden &quot;thanks to the trade union &#x27;terror&#x27;&quot; and that the party ought to appeal for the votes of all socialists and trade unionists opposed to being herded into the political wilderness. When Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s son, Malcolm, fought the Ross and Cromarty by-election of 1936, he found himself opposed by Randolph Churchill standing as a Conservative and arguing that &#x27;National Labour&#x27; was a &quot;sham device&quot; with no real support. After learning of his son&#x27;s success, Ramsay MacDonald corrected a correspondent who had referred to &quot;Labour&#x27;s defeat&quot; by asserting, &quot;Labour was victorious, and a queer mixture which had neither principle nor political policy, now known as Opposition Labour, was defeated&quot;.

=== Later years ===
On 18 October 1937, Ramsay MacDonald officially opened the new headquarters of the National Labour Organisation at 57 Tufton Street. A month later, MacDonald was dead; the National Labour Organisation continued, although it postponed its conference until March 1938. When the conference happened, &quot;The Times&quot; greeted it with a leader commending the party for striking &quot;deeper roots than a group formed around a particular personality&quot;. Malcolm MacDonald took the leadership of the group in Parliament and National Labour members retained office—the party issued a declaration of support for Neville Chamberlain over the Munich Agreement.

In the first edition of the &quot;News-Letter&quot; for 1939, a declaration from National Labour was printed and it pledged support for a united British Empire, a strong League of Nations (&quot;for bringing about constructive schemes of world appeasement, economic as well as political&quot;), the national planning of our economic life, preservation of the countryside and the improvement of social services. When Germany invaded the whole of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, an editorial called for &quot;a Government of national concentration&quot; which would have to include &quot;the trusted leaders of the trade unions and the Opposition parties&quot;. A Parliamentary motion from Anthony Eden and Winston Churchill calling for a National government &quot;on the widest possible basis&quot; was given support from the &quot;News-Letter&quot; in the following issue.

In the run-up to an expected general election in autumn 1939, several National Labour candidates were adopted and the party attracted some high-profile figures to defect to it (including former MP Michael Marcus). The outbreak of war, delaying the election, forced the group to reconsider. In February 1940, it was announced that the party would not be holding an annual conference that year and had suspended publication of &quot;News Letter&quot;. In February 1942, Stephen King-Hall resigned from the Parliamentary Party, stating that he wanted to oppose the involvement of party political considerations in wartime. In May 1943, he was followed by Kenneth Lindsay reducing the Parliamentary group to only five in number. Earl De La Warr resigned in August 1943, succeeded as chairman by Richard Denman.

=== Dissolution ===
A special conference of the National Labour Organisation on 14 June 1945 decided to dissolve the party. Malcolm Macdonald chose not to defend his seat and retired from front-line politics though was later appointed as High Commissioner to India and Governor of Kenya. The other former National Labour MPs adopted were redesignated to run as National Parliamentary candidates. The organisation issued a closing statement that praised the Labour Party for joining the Coalition in 1940 and condemned it for breaking up the Coalition immediately after victory in Europe. It called &quot;all men and women of progressive outlook&quot; to vote to re-elect the Churchill government. In recording the dissolution, the &quot;Election Diary&quot; in &quot;The Observer&quot; considered the surprising thing to be that it took place in a year as late as 1945.

The five remaining National Labour MPs were rebadged as &#x27;National&#x27; candidates and were defeated in the subsequent 1945 General Election. Former National Labour MP Kenneth Lindsay was re-elected as an independent after moving constituencies from Kilmarnock to Combined English Universities. The &quot;News-Letter&quot; continued, with an editorial line critical of the post-war Labour government. In September 1946, it urged progressive members of the Conservative Party to discard their name and join with the Liberal Party under another name; the editorial believed &quot;the struggle for the future will be for individual rights against the omnipotent State, democracy against despotism&quot;. The last edition of the &quot;News-Letter&quot; was dated April–July 1947.

Subsequently, Harold Nicolson joined the Labour Party and stood as its candidate in the 1948 Croydon North by-election, which he lost. Sir Frank Markham joined the Conservatives and returned to the House of Commons as the MP for Buckingham at the 1951 general election. Markham retired from parliament in 1964. Leslie Thomas (the son of Jimmy Thomas) had stood as a National Labour candidate in Leek in the 1935 general election. In 1953, he was elected as a Conservative Party candidate for Canterbury in a by-election until he stood down in 1966.

The only former National Labour politician to return to government besides Jowitt was Earl De La Warr in 1951. He was appointed by Prime Minister Winston Churchill as Postmaster General. It was a ministerial appointment but outside the Cabinet. De La Warr retired in 1955.

<doc id="435577" wikidata="Q928614" url="?curid=435577" title="Bradninch">
<text>Bradninch is a small town, civil parish and manor in Devon, England, lying about south of Cullompton. Much of the surrounding farmland belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall. There is an electoral ward with the same name, which since May 2023 comprises the entire parish. The population was 2,165 in 2021.

In 2012, in research of 2,400 postcodes in England and Wales which took into account 60 separate factors of interest to young families, Bradninch was found to be the fifteenth most family friendly location in the country.

The town is twinned with Landunvez in Brittany and Downingtown, Pennsylvania.

==Toponymy==
The place-name &#x27;Bradninch&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &#x27;Bradenese&#x27;; the name is thought to mean &#x27;broad oak&#x27; or &#x27;broad ash&#x27;. Seventy-nine different spellings of the name of the town have been recorded.

==History==
===Anglo-Saxon===
Bradninch dates back to before the 7th century and at some time there was almost certainly a Norman or Anglo-Saxon fortress on Castle Hill. There are no physical remains, and no known primary documentary references, but the likely site was surrounded by a number of &#x27;castle&#x27; field names on the tithe map. It would have been unusual for Bradninch not to have had a castle given its status in the medieval period.

===Norman===
Bradninch was the &quot;caput&quot; of the feudal barony of Bradninch granted by William the Conqueror (1066–1087) to William Capra, who is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as holding this manor. The barony escheated to the crown and King Henry I (1100–1135) granted it to William I de Tracy (d.circa 1136). He left one daughter and sole-heiress Grace de Tracy who married John de Sudeley, They had two children: Ralph de Sudeley (d. 1192), the eldest, who became his father&#x27;s heir, and Sir William II &quot;de Tracy&quot; (d. post 1172), who inherited his mother&#x27;s barony of Bradninch and assumed her family name in lieu of his patronymic. He married Hawise de Born and had a son William III de Tracy (d. pre-1194), one of the four knights who assassinated Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, in December 1170.

===The value of Bradninch===
Following the execution of King Charles I in 1649, an Act of Parliament was passed which allowed the sale of the feudal barony of Bradninch (or &quot;honour of Bradninch&quot;) together with its caput, namely the manor of Bradninch, together with the borough of Bradninch, and on 24 March 1650 all were sold for the sum of £19,517 11 shillings 10 1/4 pence to Thomas Sanders and John Gorges as trustees for the new Commonwealth. The feudal barony and manor were returned to the Dukedom of Cornwall following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 although the feudal element of the holding was effectively extinguished at about the same time by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660.

William, Prince of Wales as the present Duke of Cornwall, remains the nominal lord of the manor of Bradninch, and the theoretical feudal baron of Bradninch, and the Duchy of Cornwall continues to own much of the land within the parish.

===Later history===
The town was largely destroyed in a fire in 1666 (the same year as the Great Fire of London).

Bradninch lost its borough status in 1886 under the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act. The property of the corporation, including Bradninch Guildhall, has since been vested in the Bradninch Town Trust, which is a separate organisation to the town council, though four of its nine trustees are appointed by the town council.

==Notable buildings==
Notable buildings in the town include Bradninch Guildhall (on which the Bradninch Eagle is depicted), The Castle (public house), the Manor House, Earlsland House, Comfort House, and the parish church. A large part of the town is covered by a conservation area, first designated in 1973.
===St Disen&#x27;s Church===
The 15th-century church is dedicated to St Disen (a unique dedication in the British Isles) who is considered to have been an Irish missionary saint. Previously this church was dedicated to St Denis or St Dionysius. Some confusion has arisen with some believing the attribution to St Disen to have been a romantic invention of one of the 19th-century vicars of the parish, Rev. Mr. Croslegh. The church possesses a finely decorated screen; in the panels at the screen&#x27;s base are nearly 50 paintings of saints and biblical scenes. Another screen in the church is simpler, with panels of various saints, including an unusual one of St Francis of Assisi receiving the stigmata.

===Bradninch Manor House===

The surviving grade I listed manor house is situated on the north side of Parsonage Lane, to the immediate east of the town. It was built in 1553 by Peter Sainthill (c.1524-1571), MP, Recorder of Bradninch and Deputy Steward to the Duke of Cornwall of the manor of Bradninch. It was the scene of &quot;Peter&#x27;s Banquet&quot; or &quot;The Cavalier in the Dumps&quot;, a Puritan satirical verse written &quot;circa&quot; 1645, describing a banquet held there during the Civil War for his soldiers by Captain Peter Sainthill (1593–1648), MP, grandson of the builder. One of the verses is as follows:&lt;br&gt;
:Peter, their Captain, for to try
:If good King Charles they&#x27;d stand by,
:Prepared a Banquet at his hall,
:And there invited one and all
:To eat, and drink, and for to sing
:&quot;God bless the cause! God bless the King!&quot;

The present structure represents only half of the original &quot;H-shaped&quot; building. During World War II it served as a home for evacuees from Duchy-owned properties in London. Immediately after the War, in the late 1940s it served as a boarding school for very young children. Many of the original fittings of some of the 17th century rooms were removed illegally by the then owners in 1980, but the magnificently decorated &quot;Job Room&quot; survives in its original Jacobean form, and is comparable to a similar room with internal porch at nearby Bradfield House, Uffculme.

==Political representation==

The parish is divided between two wards, called Town and Rural, which respectively elect 11 and 1 councillors to the town council. Town ward includes Hele. The town council comprises all 12 parish councillors, one of which is elected by the council to be the town mayor, and there is also an appointed town clerk.

The entire parish of Bradninch lies within the Cullompton &amp; Bradninch electoral division of Devon County Council.

Since its creation at the 2010 general election, Central Devon has returned a Conservative Member of Parliament, Mel Stride; Town ward falls within this constituency of Central Devon, whilst the Rural ward falls within the constituency of Honiton and Sidmouth.

==Population==
The 2021 census recorded the population of the town settlement as 1,824. The census recorded the population of Town ward as 2,002 and the population of the parish as 2,165.

The 2012 population estimate for the parish was 2,222.
The 2013 population estimate for the parish was 2,366.
According to the Office for National Statistics Bradninch ward had a population of 1,775 in April 2001.

In 1887, according to John Bartholomew&#x27;s Gazetteer of the British Isles, the population was 1,705.

In 1851 the population was 1,834.

==Transport==
To the east of the town runs the Culm Valley, along which the M5 motorway and the Bristol–Exeter railway line pass. The town used to be served by the Hele &amp; Bradninch railway station at Hele, located on that line, which is now closed. Today, the nearest railway stations – all approximately 9 miles distant – are Tiverton Parkway, which is on Great Western Railway&#x27;s London Paddington to Penzance route, and Pinhoe, Cranbrook and Whimple, all of which are on South Western Railway&#x27;s London Waterloo to Exeter St Davids route.

Stagecoach South West bus route 1 provides a regular public transport service to and through the town, and connects Bradninch with Exeter, Cullompton, Uffculme and Tiverton.

==Books about Bradninch==

The best known book about the town is by Charles Croslegh. He became vicar of Bradninch in 1897 and wrote a 360-page history of the town entitled &quot;Bradninch, being a short historical sketch of the honor, the manor, the borough, and liberties, and the parish&quot;.

Other books have been written about the history of Bradninch and Hele by Anthony Taylor and by Paddy Nash.

==Royal connections==
The Bradninch &#x27;eagle&#x27; seal – an eagle displayed sable on a shield argent – was given to the burgesses of the town in about 1120 by the illegitimate son of Henry I, Arthur Reginald (Earl of Cornwall and Lord of Bradninch), when, by his letters patent, he incorporated the town and borough of Bradninch.
In 1337 King Edward III bestowed the first English dukedom on his eldest son, also called Edward (and later known as &#x27;The Black Prince&#x27;), naming him the Duke of Cornwall and Baron of Bradninch. Since then, the Monarch&#x27;s eldest son has been the Lord of the Manor of Bradninch. The Prince of Wales, Prince William, currently holds the title. Much of the farmland around the town still belongs to his Duchy of Cornwall estate. In July 2016, Charles, at the time the Duke of Cornwall, visited Bradninch to inspect a new &quot;affordable housing&quot; development built in partnership by the Duchy and the Guinness Trust.

==Notoriety==
Bradninch, although not the last, was one of the last towns in England to punish someone by placing them in stocks. On 2 November 1866 Cornelius Pippet, a cooper was convicted of drunkenness and placed in stocks for 6 hours. The stocks are part of the town&#x27;s historical memorabilia kept in Bradninch Guildhall.

It was in Bradninch, in 1702, that George Boone III, grandfather of the American pioneer Daniel Boone, joined the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Daniel Boone&#x27;s father, Squire Boone (1696–1765), immigrated to colonial Pennsylvania from Bradninch sometime around 1712.

<text>Janata Dal () was an Indian political party which was formed through the merger of Lok Dal, Indian National Congress (Jagjivan), and the Jan Morcha on 11 October 1988—the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan under the leadership of V. P. Singh.

==History==
V. P. Singh united the entire disparate spectrum of parties ranging from regional parties such as the Telugu Desam Party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, and the Asom Gana Parishad, together and formed the National Front with N. T. Rama Rao as President and V. P. Singh as convenor. The front also included outside support from the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party and the left-wing Left Front, led by the Communist Party of India and Communist Party of India (Marxist). They defeated Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s Congress (I) in the 1989 parliamentary elections.
His government fell after Lalu Prasad Yadav got Advani arrested in Samastipur and stopped his &quot;Ram Rath Yatra,&quot; which was going to Ayodhya on the site of the Babri Masjid on 23 October 1990, and the Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support. V. P. Singh lost a parliamentary vote of confidence on 7 November 1990. In the 1991 Indian general election the Janata Dal lost power but emerged as the third largest party in Lok Sabha.
The Janata Dal-led United Front formed the government after the 1996 Indian general election with the outside support of the Indian National Congress. However, after this the Janata Dal gradually disintegrated into various smaller factions, which largely became regional parties such as Biju Janata Dal, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (Secular) and Janata Dal (United).

==Ascent to power==

It first came to power in 1989, after cases of corruption, known as the Bofors scandal, caused Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s Congress (I) to lose the elections. The National Front coalition that was formed consisted of the Janata Dal and a few smaller parties in the government, and had outside support from the Left Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party. V. P. Singh was the prime minister. In November 1990, this coalition collapsed, and a new government headed by Chandra Shekhar under Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya) which had the support of the congress came to power for a short while. Two days before the vote, Chandra Shekhar, an ambitious Janata Dal rival who had been kept out of the National Front government, joined with Devi Lal, a former deputy prime minister under V. P. Singh, to form the Samajwadi Janata Party, with a total of just sixty Lok Sabha members. The day after the collapse of the National Front government, Chandra Shekhar informed the president that by gaining the backing of the Congress (I) and its electoral allies he enjoyed the support of 280 members of the Lok Sabha, and he demanded the right to constitute a new government. Even though his rump party accounted for only one-ninth of the members of the Lok Sabha, Chandra Shekhar succeeded in forming a new minority Government and becoming Prime Minister (with Devi Lal as deputy prime minister). However, Chandra Shekhar&#x27;s government fell less than four months later, after the Congress (I) withdrew its support.

Its second spell of power began in 1996, when the Janata Dal-led United Front coalition came to power, with outside support from the congress under Sitaram Kesri, choosing H. D. Deve Gowda as their prime minister. The Congress withdrew their support in less than a year, after the H. D. Deve Gowda Government restarted probing the corruption cases against a lot of Congress leaders, hoping to gain power with the support of various United Front constituent groups, and I. K. Gujral became the next prime minister. His government too fell in a few months, and in February 1998, the Janata Dal-led coalition lost power to the Bharatiya Janata Party in General Elections.

<text>The Gregorian Reforms were a series of reforms initiated by Pope Gregory VII and the circle he formed in the papal curia, c. 1050–80, which dealt with the moral integrity and independence of the clergy. The reforms are considered to be named after Pope Gregory VII (1073–85), though he personally denied it and claimed his reforms, like his regnal name, honoured Pope Gregory I.

==Overview==
The Gregorian reform was a frontal attack against the political-religious collusion dating from the Carolingians, in which institutions and church property were largely controlled by secular authorities while the clerics (from the pope and the bishop to the country priest) were subject by customary law to the authority of the emperor, the king, the prince or the lord.

The following uses were thus most protested against:

# The investiture of clerics or the handing over of a religious function to a cleric by a layman: The custom had, in the eyes of the reformers, led to the greatest aberrations in Germany, where the emperor granted his vassals, the prelates, ecclesiastical investiture with a crozier and ring, while at the same time granting them secular power over their diocese or religious principality.
# Layman’s control over church property: some bishoprics and abbeys not only belonged to the patrimony of the sovereigns, but they had also usurped important ecclesiastical revenues (dimes, altars, etc.).
# Simony, or trading in religious functions: this accusation was levelled primarily at those laymen who collected ecclesiastical revenues for their own account and who entrusted these functions to those who offered the most, with the complicity of certain ecclesiastical authorities.
# The marriage of priests: the moral decadence of the clergy was seen as the logical consequence of the entanglement of the spiritual and the temporal. The temporal limits of this protest movement are the Roman Synod of 1059 on the one hand, and the compromise solution instituted by the Concordat of Worms (1122) on the other hand.

During Gregory&#x27;s pontificate, a conciliar approach to implementing papal reform took on an added momentum. Conciliarism properly refers to a later system of power between the Pope, the Roman curia, and secular authorities. During this early period, the scope of Papal authority in the wake of the Investiture Controversy entered into dialogue with developing notions of Papal supremacy. The authority of the emphatically &quot;Roman&quot; council as the universal legislative assembly was theorised according to the principles of papal primacy contained in &quot;Dictatus papae&quot;.

Gregory also had to avoid the Catholic Church slipping back into the abuses that had occurred in Rome, during the Rule of the Harlots, between 904 and 964. Pope Benedict IX had been elected Pope three times and had sold the Papacy. In 1054 the &quot;Great Schism&quot; had divided Western European Christians from the Eastern Orthodox Church. Given these events, the Catholic Church had to reassert its importance and authority to its followers. Within the church, important new laws were pronounced on simony, on clerical marriage and from 1059 on extending the prohibited degrees of affinity. Although at each new turn the reforms were presented to contemporaries as a return to the old ways, they are often seen by modern historians as novel. The much later Gregorian calendar of Pope Gregory XIII has no connection to those Gregorian reforms.

==Documents==

The reforms are encoded in two major documents: &quot;Dictatus papae&quot; and the bull &quot;Libertas ecclesiae&quot;. The Gregorian reform depended in new ways and to a new degree on the collections of canon law that were being assembled, in order to buttress the papal position, during the same period. Part of the legacy of the Gregorian Reform was the new figure of the &quot;papal legist&quot;, exemplified a century later by Pope Innocent III. There is no explicit mention of Gregory&#x27;s reforms against simony (the selling of church offices and sacred things) or nicolaism (which included ritual fornication) at his Lenten Councils of 1075 or 1076. Rather, the gravity of these reforms has to be inferred from his general correspondence. By contrast, Gregory&#x27;s Register entry for the Roman Council of November 1078 extensively records Gregory&#x27;s legislation against &#x27;abuses&#x27; such as simony as well as the first &#x27;full&#x27; prohibition of lay investiture. This record has been interpreted as the essence of the Gregorian &#x27;reform programme&#x27;.

The powers that the Gregorian papacy gathered to itself are summed up in a list called &quot;Dictatus papae&quot; around 1075 or shortly after. The major headings of Gregorian reform can be seen as embodied in the Papal electoral decree (1059), and the temporary resolution of the Investiture Controversy (1075–1122) was an overwhelming papal victory. The resolution of this controversy acknowledged papal superiority over secular rulers by implication.

==Central status of the church==
Before the Gregorian Reforms the Catholic Church was a heavily decentralized institution, in which the pope held little power outside his position as Bishop of Rome. With that in mind, the papacy up until the twelfth century held little to no authority over the bishops, who were invested with land by lay rulers. Gregory VII&#x27;s ban on lay investiture was a key element of the reform, ultimately contributing to the centralized papacy of the later Middle Ages.

The reform of the church, both within it, and in relation to the Holy Roman Emperor and the other lay rulers of Europe, was Gregory VII&#x27;s life work. It was based on his conviction that the church was founded by God and entrusted with the task of embracing all mankind in a single society in which divine will is the only law; that, in his capacity as a divine institution, he is supreme over all human structures, especially the secular state; and that the pope, in his role as head of the church under the petrine commission, is the vice-regent of God on earth, so that disobedience to him implies disobedience to God: or, in other words, a defection from Christianity. But any attempt to interpret this in terms of action would have bound the church to annihilate not merely a single state, but all states. Thus Gregory, as a politician wanting to achieve some result, was driven in practice to adopt a different standpoint. He acknowledged the existence of the state as a dispensation of Providence, described the coexistence of church and state as a divine ordinance, and emphasized the necessity of union between the &quot;sacerdotium&quot; and the &quot;imperium&quot;. But, during no period would he have imagined the two powers on an equal footing. The superiority of Church to State was to him a fact which admitted no discussion and which he had never doubted.

He wished to see all important matters of dispute referred to Rome; appeals were to be addressed to himself; the centralization of ecclesiastical government in Rome naturally involved a curtailment of the powers of bishops. Since these refused to submit voluntarily and tried to assert their traditional independence, his papacy was full of struggles against the higher ranks of the clergy.

==Clerical celibacy==
This battle for the foundation of papal supremacy is connected with his championship of compulsory celibacy among the clergy and his attack on simony. Gregory VII did not introduce the celibacy of the priesthood into the church, but he took up the struggle with greater energy than his predecessors. In 1074 he published an encyclical, absolving the people from their obedience to bishops who allowed married priests. The next year he enjoined them to take action against married priests and deprived these clerics of their revenues. Both the campaign against priestly marriage and that against simony provoked widespread resistance.

<doc id="435585" wikidata="Q2464975" url="?curid=435585" title="Kimberley, Nottinghamshire">
<text>Kimberley is a market town and civil parish in the Borough of Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire, England, lying 6 miles northwest of Nottingham along the A610. The town grew as a centre for coal mining, brewing and hosiery manufacturing. At the 2011 census the town had a population of 6,053, and this fell to 6,033 at the 2021 census.

==History==
Kimberley is referred to as Chinemarelie in William the Conqueror&#x27;s Domesday Book. With the accession of William to the throne Kimberley came into the possession of William de Peveril. The Peverils lost control when they supported the losing side in the civil war which preceded the accession of Henry II of England in 1154. The King became the owner of the land. King John of England granted land in the area to Ralph de Greasley in 1212 who took up residence at Greasley Castle and also at around this time to Henry de Grey whose son re-built Codnor Castle on the site of an earlier castle established by William Peveril.

Ralph de Greasley&#x27;s land passed by inheritance and marriage to Nicholas de Cantelupe who took part in Edward III of England&#x27;s Scottish campaigns and also the Battle of Crécy. Nicholas founded Beauvale Priory using part of his Kimberley holding in 1343. That part of Kimberley which had become the property of Beauvale Priory was claimed by King Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century.

The Priory&#x27;s land was redistributed by the King and came into the possession of Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham again by inheritance and marriage in 1627. Arthur was beheaded in 1649 having fought for the Royalists in the English Civil War. Arthur&#x27;s son was created Earl of Essex in 1661.

In 1753 the land was purchased by Sir Matthew Lamb whose grandson William Lamb became Prime Minister in 1834. The Lamb&#x27;s Kimberley estates passed by marriage to the 5th Earl Cowper in 1805 and on the death of the 7th Earl in 1913 were sold off in pieces.

That part of Kimberley retained by the Cantelupe&#x27;s passed by inheritance and marriage to John Lord Zouch who died at the Battle of Bosworth with Richard III in 1485. He was posthumously found guilty of high treason with his property forfeited to Henry VII. John Savage (-1491) received this part of Kimberley in gratitude for his efforts on behalf of Henry VII at Bosworth. The Savage family sold this land to the Earl of Rutland in the early 17th century. The Duke of Rutland&#x27;s Kimberley estates were sold in parcels in the early 19th century.

==Industry==
Kimberley has been home to a lot of industry including: coal mining, brewing and hosiery manufacturing.

All major industry in Kimberley has stopped, the last being Kimberley Brewery which ceased brewing in December 2006. Most businesses are now retail-based concerns.

==Kimberley today==

One of Kimberley&#x27;s most notable structures is its unusual war memorial, in the form of a rotunda which is used as the emblem of Kimberley School. This secondary school has a catchment area which extends into the neighbouring areas of Nuthall, Eastwood, Watnall, and Hempshill Vale.
On the south side of Kimberley lies Swingate, which has many different walking and cycling routes into the woods and surrounding countryside.

The twin towns of Kimberley are Échirolles in France and Grugliasco in Italy.
Kimberley Brewery was taken over by Greene King in 2006, another major brewer in a multimillion-pound deal which marked the end of the traditional Kimberley Ales as ale brewing ceased shortly afterwards and only a distribution centre remained there.

The former Kimberley Brewery site has within its boundaries a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It is listed under the title of &quot;Kimberley Railway Cutting&quot; as an important location for Permian Gymnosperm fossils. The Permian - Carboniferous unconformity can be found in the Kimberley Railway Cutting.

Since 1974, Kimberley forms part of the borough of Broxtowe. From 1894 to 1974 it was part of Basford Rural District Council area.

There has been speculation that the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) want to extend their tram line that currently terminates at Phoenix Park stop through Kimberley towards Giltbrook Retail Park.

<doc id="435587" wikidata="Q562394" url="?curid=435587" title="Theudas">
<text>Theudas (; ; died ) was a Jewish rebel of the 1st century AD. Scholars attribute to his name a Greek etymology possibly meant as &quot;flowing with water&quot;, although with a Hellenist-styled ending. At some point between 44 and 46 AD, Theudas led his followers in a short-lived revolt.

==The revolt==

The principal source for the story of Theudas&#x27; revolt is Josephus, who wrote:

It came to pass, while Cuspius Fadus was procurator of Judea, that a certain charlatan, whose name was Theudas, persuaded a great part of the people to take their effects with them, and follow him to the Jordan river; for he told them he was a prophet, and that he would, by his own command, divide the river, and afford them an easy passage over it. Many were deluded by his words. However, Fadus did not permit them to take any advantage of his wild attempt but sent a troop of horsemen out against them. After falling upon them unexpectedly, they slew many of them and took many of them alive. They also took Theudas alive, cut off his head, and carried it to Jerusalem. (&quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot; 20.97-98)

Josephus does not provide a number for Theudas&#x27;s followers, but the movement was dispersed and never heard of again.

Religious scholars defend the apparent historical inaccuracy of Acts 5:36–37 by claiming that Rabbi Gamaliel refers to another Theudas who led a band of 400 about 40 years earlier; although uncorroborated, this would explain why Acts says that the revolt of Theudas preceded that of Judas of Galilee.

==The Theudas Problem==

The sole reference to Theudas presents a problem of chronology if one assumes that the Acts of the Apostles and Josephus are speaking of the same person. In Acts, Gamaliel, a member of the Sanhedrin, defends the apostles by referring to Theudas:
Gamaliel, speaking before the year 37, refers to an incident that preceded the revolt of Judas of Galilee at the time of the Census of Quirinius decades before, in 6 CE. Josephus makes clear that the revolt of his Theudas took place , years after Gamaliel addressed the Sanhedrin and an entire generation after Judas the Galilean.

It has been proposed that the writer of Acts used Josephus as a source, and made a mistake in reading the text, taking a later reference to the execution of the &quot;sons of Judas the Galilean&quot; after the rebellion of Theudas as saying that the rebellion of Judas was later; however it is a minority view, since most scholars agree that Luke and Josephus used separate, independent sources. It has also been suggested that the reference in Acts is to a different revolt by another, unknown Theudas, because Josephus states that there were numerous uprisings, saying there were &quot;ten thousand disorders&quot;, but he gives details on only four and Theudas was not a unique name. According to ancient historian and New Testament scholar Paul Barnett &quot;It seems unlikely that Luke would have made an error about an infamous contemporary&quot;. It is also possible that Josephus himself made a mistake, the &quot;Pulpit Commentary&quot; states: &quot;Josephus may have misplaced the adventure of Theudas by some accidental error. Considering the vast number of Jewish insurrections from the death of Herod the Great to the destruction of Jerusalem, such a mistake is not very improbable.&quot;

<doc id="435588" wikidata="Q514243" url="?curid=435588" title="Soldier beetle">
<text>The soldier beetles (Cantharidae) are relatively soft-bodied, straight-sided beetles. They are cosmopolitan in distribution. One of the first described species has a color pattern reminiscent of the red coats of early British soldiers, hence the common name. They are also known commonly as leatherwings because of their soft elytra.

Historically, these beetles were placed in a superfamily &quot;Cantharoidea&quot;, which has been subsumed by the superfamily Elateroidea; the name is still sometimes used as a rankless grouping, including the families Cantharidae, Lampyridae, Lycidae, Omethidae (which includes Telegeusidae), Phengodidae, and Rhagophthalmidae.

Soldier beetles often feed on nectar and pollen as well as predating other small insects. The larvae are caterpillar like, dark colored, active and covered in fine hairs, earning them the name velvet worms. They feed on the ground and in foliage hunting eggs, small insects, snails and other small creatures.

== Evolutionary history ==
The oldest described member of the family is &quot;Molliberus&quot; from the Early Cretaceous (early Albian) aged El Soplao amber from Cantabria, Spain, belonging to the tribe Cantharini in the subfamily Cantharinae. Other described genera include 6 from the early Late Cretaceous (early Cenomanian) aged Burmese amber, with 5 belonging to Cantharinae and one to Malthininae, and &quot;Katyacantharis&quot;, from the Cenomanian aged Agdzhakend amber of Azerbaijan, suggested to belong to Cantharinae. Indeterminate specimens have been reported from the Aptian aged Koonwarra fossil bed of the Strzelecki Group, Australia and the Barremian aged Lebanese amber.

** &quot;Caccodes&quot; - Central America, Pacific islands
** &quot;Malthinellus&quot; - Japan
** &quot;Malthinus&quot; - Japan, Europe, N. America
* tribe Malthodini
** &quot;Frostia&quot; 
** &quot;Malthodes&quot; - mostly Europe, N. America &amp; New Zealand
** †&quot;Archaeomalthodes&quot; Burmese amber, Myanmar, Cenomanian

=== Silinae ===
* tribe Silini
** &quot;Cordylocera&quot; 
** &quot;Silis&quot; 
* tribe Tytthonyxini
** &quot;Tytthonyx&quot; 

==Reproduction==
Large males of the soldier beetle exercise choice for larger females. Body size correlates with the abilities of males to secure females, and of females to evade males.

<doc id="435592" wikidata="Q317769" url="?curid=435592" title="Gulzarilal Nanda">
<text>Gulzarilal Nanda (4 July 1898 – 15 January 1998) was an Indian politician and economist who specialised in labour issues. He was the Acting Prime Minister of India for two 13-day tenures following the deaths of Jawaharlal Nehru in 1964 and Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1966 respectively. Both his terms ended after the ruling Indian National Congress&#x27;s parliamentary party elected a new prime minister. He was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian award, in 1997.

==Early life==
===Birth===

Nanda was born on 4 July 1898 in Sialkot in the Punjab, British India in a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family. Sialkot later became a part of the Punjab Province of Pakistan in 1947, after the partition of India. Nanda received his education in Lahore, Amritsar, Agra, and Allahabad.

He met Mahatma Gandhi in 1921, where he settled in Gujarat on his request.

===Research worker===
Nanda worked as a research scholar on labour problems at Allahabad University (1920–1921), and became a professor of economics at National College in Bombay (Mumbai) in 1921. The same year, he joined the Indian Non-Cooperation Movement against the British Raj. In 1922, he became secretary of the Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association where he worked until 1946. He was imprisoned for Satyagraha in 1932, and again from 1942 to 1944.. He was honoured with &quot;Proud Past Alumni&quot; in the list of 42 members, from &quot;Allahabad University Alumni Association&quot;, NCR, Ghaziabad (Greater Noida) Chapter 2007–2008 registered under society act 1860 with registration no. 407/2000.

He married Lakshmi, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.

==Lok Sabha member==
Nanda was elected to the Lok Sabha in the 1957 elections, and was appointed Union Minister for Labour, Employment and Planning, and later, as Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission. He visited the Federal Republic of Germany, Yugoslavia, and Austria in 1959.

Nanda was re-elected to the Lok Sabha in the 1962 elections from the Sabarkantha constituency in Gujarat. He initiated the Congress Forum for Socialist Action in 1962. He was Union Minister for Labour and Employment in 1962–1963, and Minister for Home Affairs in 1963–1966.

Nanda was re-elected to the Lok Sabha in the 1967 and 1971 elections from the Kaithal Constituency in Haryana. He was a principled man. In 1971, he resigned from the Congress saying that he did not like the politics of that era.

== Acting Prime Minister ==
Nanda was the Acting Prime Minister of India twice for thirteen days each: the first time after the death of first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1964, and the second time after the death of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1966. He was the Home Minister of India during both these periods, and this is the reason why he was chosen as Prime Minister. The Indian Constitution has no provision for an &quot;acting&quot; Prime Minister. Both his terms were uneventful, yet they came at sensitive times because of the potential danger to the country following Nehru&#x27;s death soon after the Sino-Indian War in 1962 and Shastri&#x27;s death after the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965.

==Death==
Nanda died on 15 January 1998 at the age of 99; from 25 November 1997 when former Malawian President Hastings Banda died; until his own death Nanda was the oldest living former state leader. At his death, Nanda was the last surviving member of the second and third Nehru cabinets and the last living state leader to have been born in the 19th century.

== Gandhian life ==
He lived a very simple life, with no personal property at the time of his death. He never allowed politics to influence his family life. Yet he always had enough time for his family. He once engaged his government provided driver for a car that was used by his family. He never allowed his family to use his official vehicle. He once got angry with his staff when he learned that his grandson, Tejas used his office paper and drew a picture. He immediately purchased paper from market and gave his grandson to draw on it.

He was also concerned about rising corruption in the country and suggested to decrease wasteful consumption by officials and people in general. He had also opposed the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, as he felt that the sacrifices to bring democracy to India became meaningless due to the tyranny.

== Awards and honours ==
** Bharat Ratna (1997)

== In popular culture ==
&quot;A Dedicated Worker – Shri Gulzarilal Nanda&quot; is a 1999 short documentary film directed by A. K. Goorha and produced by the Films Division of India which covers Nanda&#x27;s work towards labourers and others as the PM and otherwise.

<text>KKR &amp; Co. Inc., also known as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., is an American global private-equity and investment company. , the firm had completed private-equity investments in portfolio companies with approximately $710 billion of total enterprise value. Its assets under management (AUM) and fee paying assets under management (FPAUM) were $553 billion and $446 billion, respectively.

KKR was founded in 1976 by Jerome Kohlberg Jr., and cousins Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, all of whom had previously worked together at Bear Stearns, where they completed some of the earliest leveraged buyout transactions. Since its founding, KKR has completed a number of transactions, including the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, which was the largest buyout in history to that point, as well as the 2007 buyout of TXU, which is currently the largest buyout completed to date.

In October 2009, KKR listed shares in the company through KKR &amp; Co., an affiliate that holds 30% of the firm&#x27;s ownership equity, with the remainder held by the firm&#x27;s partners. In March 2010, KKR filed to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with trading commencing four months later, on July 15, 2010.

==The firm==
The firm employed 4,490 employees as of December 31, 2023. KKR is headquartered at 30 Hudson Yards, Manhattan, New York, with offices in Beijing, Dubai, Dublin, Houston, Hong Kong, London, Luxembourg, Madrid, Menlo Park, Mumbai, Paris, Riyadh, San Francisco, São Paulo, Seoul, Singapore, Shanghai, Sydney and Tokyo.

=== Senior leadership ===

* &quot;Chairmen:&quot; Henry Kravis and George Roberts (since 1987)
* &quot;Chief Executives:&quot; Scott Nuttall and Joseph Bae (since 2021)

* Henry Kravis, George Roberts, and Jerome Kohlberg Jr. (1976–1987); co-CEOs
* Henry Kravis and George Roberts (1987–2021); co-CEOs

=== Business structure ===
In a 2016 interview with Bloomberg, founder Henry Kravis described KKR in terms of three broad buckets: private markets, public markets, and capital markets.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
While running the corporate finance department for Bear Stearns in the 1960s and 1970s, Jerome Kohlberg, and later Henry Kravis and George Roberts, completed a series of what they described as &quot;bootstrap&quot; investments. They targeted family-owned businesses, many of which had been founded in the years following World War II, that were facing succession issues. Many of these companies lacked a viable exit for their founders because they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors.
In 1964, Lewis Cullman acquired and then sold Orkin Exterminating Company in what some call the first significant leveraged buyout transaction. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers completed a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973), as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Despite a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.

By 1976, tensions had built up between Bear Stearns and Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts, which led to the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns. The name had been planned to be Kohlberg Roberts Kravis, but public relations advisors preferred the sound of KKR.

The new KKR completed its first buyout, of manufacturer A.J. Industries, in 1976. KKR raised capital from a small group of investors including the Hillman Company and First Chicago Bank. By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising its first institutional fund with over $30 million of investor commitments. In 1981, KKR expanded its investor base after the Oregon State Treasury&#x27;s public pension fund invested in KKR&#x27;s acquisition of retailer Fred Meyer, Inc. Oregon State remains an active investor in KKR funds.

In 1979 KKR completed a risky, precedent-setting ($380 million) public-to-private leveraged buyout of a large conglomerate Houdaille Industries, a well-known producer of machine tools, industrial pipes, chrome-plated car bumpers and torsional viscous dampers, which they signed the previous year. It soon ended in a spectacular failure, breakup of the half-a-century-old company and loss of thousands of jobs, even though creditors earned a profit.

The firm&#x27;s acquisitions during the 1980s buyout boom include:

===Buyout of RJR Nabisco===
At age 61, Kohlberg resigned in 1987 (he later founded his own private equity firm, Kohlberg &amp; Co.), and Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm was responsible for the 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco was the largest buyout in history at that time, at $25 billion, and remained the largest buyout for the next 17 years. The deal was chronicled in &quot;Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco&quot;, and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.

In 1988, F. Ross Johnson was the president and CEO of RJR Nabisco, a leading producer of food and tobacco products, formed in 1985 by the merger of Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. In October of that year, Johnson proposed a $17 billion ($75 per share) management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton and its parent company, American Express.

Several days later, Kravis, who had originally suggested the idea of the buyout to Johnson, presented a new bid for $20.3 billion ($90 per share) financed with an aggressive debt package. KKR had the support of equity co-investments from pension funds and other institutional investors, including Coca-Cola, Georgia-Pacific and United Technologies corporate pension funds, as well as endowments from MIT, Harvard and the New York State Common Retirement Fund. However, KKR faced criticism from existing investors over the firm&#x27;s use of hostile tactics in the buyout of RJR.

KKR proposed to provide a joint offer with Johnson and Shearson Lehman but was rebuffed and Johnson attempted to stonewall KKR&#x27;s access to financial information from RJR. Rival private equity firm Forstmann Little &amp; Co. was invited into the process by Shearson Lehman but attempted to provide a bid for RJR with a consortium of Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Procter &amp; Gamble, Ralston Purina and Castle &amp; Cooke. Ultimately, the Forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for RJR.

In November 1988, RJR set guidelines for a final bid submission at the end of the month. The management and Shearson group submitted a final bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis and KKR. KKR&#x27;s final bid of $109, while a lower dollar figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of RJR Nabisco. KKR&#x27;s offer was guaranteed, whereas the management offer lacked a &quot;reset&quot;, meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated $112 per share.

Additionally, many in RJR&#x27;s board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of Ross Johnson&#x27;s unprecedented golden parachute deal. &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured Johnson on the cover of their December 1988 issue along with the headline, &quot;A Game of Greed: This man could pocket $100 million from the largest corporate takeover in history. Has the buyout craze gone too far?&quot;. KKR&#x27;s offer was welcomed by the board, and, to some observers, it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a deal-breaker in KKR&#x27;s favor was little more than an excuse to reject Johnson&#x27;s higher bid of $112 per share. Johnson received $53 million from the buyout. KKR collected a $75 million fee in the RJR takeover. At $31.1 billion of а transaction value (including assumed debt), RJR Nabisco was, at the time, by far the largest leveraged buyout in history.

===Early 1990s: The aftermath of RJR Nabisco===
The buyout of RJR Nabisco was completed in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR&#x27;s enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions. KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR&#x27;s portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.

As the new decade began, KKR began restructuring RJR. In January 1990, it completed the sale of RJR&#x27;s Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt. Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections, and public offerings of stock to provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company&#x27;s balance sheet. KKR&#x27;s equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of RJR had been only $1.5 billion. In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company.

RJR issued additional stock to the public in March 1991 to reduce debt further, resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of RJR&#x27;s debt from junk to investment grade. KKR began to reduce its ownership in RJR in 1994, when its stock in RJR was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of Borden, Inc., a producer of food and beverage products, consumer products, and industrial products.
 The following year, in 1995, KKR would divest itself of its final stake in RJR Nabisco when Borden sold a $638 million block of stock.

While KKR no longer had any ownership of RJR Nabisco by 1995, its original investment would not be fully realized until KKR exited its last investment in 2004. After sixteen years of efforts, including contributing new equity, taking RJR public, asset sales, and exchanging shares of RJR for the ownership of Borden, Inc., KKR finally sold the last remnants of its 1989 investment. In July 2004, KKR agreed to sell its stock in Borden Chemical to Apollo Management for $1.2 billion.

===Early 1990s: Investments===
In the early 1990s, the absence of an active high yield market prompted KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what was described as leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR&#x27;s largest investments in the 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988. KKR created Primedia&#x27;s predecessor, K-III Communications, a platform to buy media properties, initially completing the $310 million divisional buyout of the book club division of Macmillan along with the assets of Intertec Publishing Corporation in May 1989.

During the early 1990s, K-III continued acquiring publishing assets, including a $650 million acquisition from News Corporation in 1991. K-III went public, however instead of cashing out, KKR continued to make new investments in the company in 1998, 2000 and 2001 to support acquisition activity. In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR&#x27;s preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the company&#x27;s stock collapsed.

In 1991, KKR partnered with Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in the 1991 acquisition of the Bank of New England, from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In January 1996, KKR would exchange its investment for a 7.5% interest in Fleet Bank. KKR completed the 1992 buyout of American Re Corporation from Aetna as well as a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies and owner of Denny&#x27;s in 1992. Among the other notable investments KKR completed in the early 1990s included World Color Press (1993–95), RELTEC Corporation (1995) and Bruno&#x27;s (1995).

===1996–1999===
By the mid-1990s, the debt markets were improving and KKR had moved on from the RJR Nabisco buyout. In 1996, KKR was able to complete the bulk of fundraising for what was then a record $6 billion private equity fund, the KKR 1996 Fund. However, KKR was still burdened by the performance of the RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media. KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals).
KKR&#x27;s activity level would accelerate over the second half of the 1990s making a series of notable investments including Spalding Holdings Corporation and Evenflo (1996), Newsquest (1996), KinderCare Learning Centers (1997), Amphenol Corporation (1997), Randalls Food Markets (1997), The Boyds Collection (1998), MedCath Corporation (1998), Willis Group Holdings (1998), Smiths Group (1999), and Wincor Nixdorf (1999).

KKR&#x27;s largest investment of the 1990s would be one of its least successful. In January 1998, KKR and Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst agreed to the $1.5 billion buyouts of Regal Entertainment Group. KKR and Hicks Muse had initially intended to combine Regal with Act III Cinemas, which KKR had acquired in 1997 for $706 million and United Artists Theaters, which Hicks Muse had agreed to acquire for $840 million in November 1997. Shortly after agreeing to the Regal takeover, the deal with United Artists fell apart, destroying the strategy to eliminate costs by building a larger combined company. Two years later, in 2000, Regal encountered significant financial issues and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection; the company passed to billionaire investor Philip Anschutz.

===2000–2005===
At the start of the 21st century, the landscape of large leveraged buyout firms was changing. Several large and storied firms, including Hicks Muse Tate &amp; Furst and Forstmann Little &amp; Company were dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble. Although KKR&#x27;s track record since RJR Nabisco was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and RentPath (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.

Additionally, KKR was one of the few firms that were able to complete large leveraged buyout transactions in the years immediately following the collapse of the Internet bubble, including Shoppers Drug Mart and Bell Canada Yellow Pages. KKR was able to realize its investment in Shoppers Drug Mart through a 2002 IPO and subsequent public stock offerings. The directories business would be taken public in 2004 as Yellow Pages Income Fund, a Canadian income trust.
In 2004 a consortium comprising KKR, Bain Capital and real estate development company Vornado Realty Trust announced the $6.6 billion acquisition of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, the toy retailer. A month earlier, Cerberus Capital Management made a $5.5 billion offer for both the toy and baby supplies businesses. The Toys &quot;R&quot; Us buyout was one of the largest in several years. Following this transaction, by the end of 2004 and in 2005, major buyouts were once again becoming common and market observers were stunned by the leverage levels and financing terms obtained by financial sponsors in their buyouts.

In 2005, KKR was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR&#x27;s partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable given the number of firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.

=== Buyout Boom 2006–2007 ===
In 2006, KKR raised a new $17.6 billion fund, the KKR 2006 Fund, with which the firm began executing a series of some of the largest buyouts in history. KKR&#x27;s $44 billion takeover of Texas-based power utility TXU in 2007 proved to be the largest leveraged buyout of the mid-2000s buyout boom and the largest buyout completed to date. Among the most notable companies acquired by KKR in 2006 and 2007 were the following:
Other non-buyout investments completed by KKR during this period included Legg Mason, Sun Microsystems, Tarkett, Longview Power Plant, and Seven Network. In October 2006, KKR acquired a 50% stake in Tarkett, a France-based distributor of flooring products, in a deal valued at about €1.4 billion ($1.8 billion). On November 20, 2006, KKR announced it would form a A$4 billion partnership with the Seven Network of Australia. On January 23, 2007, KKR announced it would invest $700 million through a PIPE investment in Sun Microsystems. In January 2008, KKR announced it had made a $1.25 billion PIPE investment in Legg Mason through a convertible preferred stock offering.

In addition to its successful buyout transactions, KKR was involved in the failed buyout of Harman International Industries , an upscale audio equipment maker. On April 26, 2007, Harman announced it had entered an agreement to be acquired by KKR and Goldman Sachs. In September 2007, KKR and Goldman backed out of the $8 billion buyout of Harman. By the end of the day, Harman&#x27;s shares had plummeted by more than 24% upon the news.

===Initial public offering 2007===
In 2007, KKR filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $1.25 billion by selling an ownership interest in its management company. The filing came less than two weeks after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed and called off by the end of August.

The following year, in July 2008, KKR announced a new plan to list its shares. The plan called for KKR to complete a reverse takeover of its listed affiliate KKR Private Equity Investors in exchange for a 21% interest in the firm. In November 2008, KKR announced a delay of this transaction until 2009. Shares of KPE had declined significantly in the second half of 2008 with the onset of the credit crunch. KKR announced that it expected to close the transaction in 2009. In October 2009, KKR listed shares in KKR &amp; Co. on the Euronext exchange, replacing KPE, and anticipated a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. The public entity represented a 30% interest in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.

===2010–2019===
In December 2011, Samson Investment Company was acquired by a group of private equity investors led by KKR for approximately $7.2 billion and Samson Resources Corporation was formed.

<doc id="435599" wikidata="Q6142989" url="?curid=435599" title="USS Herring">
<text>USS &quot;Herring&quot; (SS-233), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the herring.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Herring&quot;″s keel was laid down 14 July 1941 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 15 January 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Emilie Spear (&quot;née&quot; Piollet), wife of Rear Admiral Ray Spear, Chief of the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, and commissioned on 4 May 1942 with Lieutenant Commander Raymond W. Johnson in command.

==Operational history==
===Mediterranean===
After shakedown, the new submarine was one of five sent to the Mediterranean Sea to take station off the North African coast prior to Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. Reaching her position off Casablanca on 5 November 1942, &quot;Herring&quot; remained there, spotting but not attacking several targets. On the morning of 8 November as the invasion was launched, the patient sub had her chance, sinking the 5,700 ton cargo ship &quot;Ville du Havre&quot;. &quot;Herring&quot; returned to Rosneath, Scotland, on 25 November and departed for her second war patrol 16 December, but targets were scarce. The fourth war patrol, an antisubmarine sweep in Icelandic waters, and fifth patrol, which took her back to the United States on 26 July 1943, netted &quot;Herring&quot; no more kills.

===Pacific===
&quot;Herring&quot; departed New London, Connecticut, for the rich hunting grounds of the Pacific on 9 August 1943. After intensive training at Pearl Harbor, she sailed 15 November 1943 on her sixth war patrol to join the ranks of the American submarines systematically decimating Japanese shipping and destroying the Japanese economy. She scored two kills, the 3,948 ton &quot;Hakozaki Maru&quot; on 14 December, and the 6,072 ton &quot;Nagoya Maru&quot; to celebrate New Year&#x27;s Day 1944. &quot;Herring&quot;&#x27;s next patrol was a frustrating one as on 24 March 1944 she stalked a large aircraft carrier but was detected and driven deep before she could attack.

Lieutenant Commander Johnson commanded Herring for five of her first six patrols, with the sole exception being March 1943 when John Corbus was in command. On her seventh and eight patrols she was captained by Lieutenant Commander David Zabriskie, Jr.

===Loss===
&quot;Herring&quot;″s eighth war patrol was to be both her most successful and her last. Topping off at Midway Island on 21 May 1944, &quot;Herring&quot; headed for the Kurile Islands patrol area. Ten days later she rendezvoused with . &quot;Herring&quot; was never heard from or seen again. However, Japanese records prove that she sank two ships, and &quot;Hokuyo Maru&quot;, on the night of 30–31 May. &quot;Ishigaki&quot; had been responsible for the sinking of on 7 October 1943. &quot;Herring&quot;″s exact manner of loss can also be determined from these records. Two more merchant ships, &quot;Hiburi Maru&quot; and &quot;Iwaki Maru&quot;, were sunk while at anchor in Matsuwa Island on the morning of 1 June 1944. In a counter-attack, enemy shore batteries scored two direct hits on the submarine&#x27;s conning tower and &quot;bubbles covered an area about 5 meters wide, and heavy oil covered an area of approximately 15 miles.&quot; On her last patrol, &quot;Herring&quot; had sunk four Japanese ships for a total of 13,202 tons. In all she had sunk six &quot;maru&quot;s totaling 19,959 tons, and a Vichy cargo ship.

==Awards==
* European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two battle star
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three battle stars
* World War II Victory Medal

==Legacy==
There is a memorial plaque at the Naval Weapons Station in Seal Beach, California, and another one, along with the ship&#x27;s bell, at Battleship Memorial Park in Mobile, Alabama.

In June 2005, at the former Tagan cape, now Pologiy cape (), near the site of the sinking, which is in seaward, a memorial sign was established to the crew of USS &quot;Herring&quot; and to those of all the lost boats, which fought against the Imperial Japan during the Second World War. The event was held in the fourth Kamchatka-Kuril historical and geographical expedition, led by the Russian researcher Evgeny Vereshaga.

In 2016 the wreck of &quot;Herring&quot; was located near Matua Island by a joint expedition of the Russian Geographical Society and Russian Defense Ministry. Aleksandr Kirillin, secretary of the academic board of Russia&#x27;s Military Historical Society, said that &quot;Russian divers in cooperation with the Pacific Fleet sailors discovered the submarine at a depth of .&quot;

<doc id="435601" wikidata="Q933721" url="?curid=435601" title="Henry Kravis">
<text>Henry Roberts Kravis (born January 6, 1944) is an American businessman, investor, and philanthropist. He is a co-founder of KKR &amp; Co. Inc.

His lavish lifestyle has been criticized by activists looking to reform private equity regulations and restrict the practice of leveraged buyouts he pioneered. His buyout of RJR Nabisco was portrayed in the 1989 book and 1993 film &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot;.

==Early life==
Kravis was born into a Jewish family in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the son of Bessie (née Roberts) and Raymond F. Kravis, a successful Tulsa oil engineer who had been a business partner of Joseph P. Kennedy. Kravis began his education at Eaglebrook School (&#x27;60), followed by high school at the Loomis Chaffee School, where he participated in student government and was elected vice president of the student council his senior year. He attended Claremont McKenna College (then known as Claremont Men&#x27;s College) and majored in economics. He was a member of the CMC varsity golf teams for four years and was a member of the Knickerbockers student service organization. He served as his sophomore class secretary-treasurer. He graduated from CMC in 1967 before going on to Columbia Business School, where he received an MBA degree in 1969.

==Career==
===Kravis at Bear Stearns===

After working at various jobs in New York City&#x27;s financial sector, he and his first cousin, George R. Roberts, joined the staff of Bear Stearns. There, they worked under the corporate finance manager, Jerome Kohlberg, Jr. They both became partners at Bear Stearns at very young ages, 30 and 31.

Working for Bear Stearns in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Kravis, alongside Kohlberg and Roberts, began a series of what they described as &quot;bootstrap&quot; investments. In the following years, Kohlberg and later Kravis and Roberts would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Although they had a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.

===Kohlberg Kravis Roberts===

By 1976, tensions had built up between Bear Stearns and the trio of Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts leading to their departure and the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities.

Kohlberg invested $100,000 while Kravis and Roberts invested $10,000 each of their own capital in their new firm. Early investors in KKR included the Hillman Family and the Griffith family (who are also large shareholders in MGM and Warner Bros. Discovery). By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising its first institutional fund with approximately $30 million of investor commitments.

In 1987, Jerome Kohlberg, Jr. resigned from KKR, and Henry Kravis and George Roberts continued to lead the firm. Under Kravis and Roberts the firm was responsible for the 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. At a cost of $31.4 billion, it was then the highest price ever paid for a commercial enterprise. The publicity surrounding the event led to the story being dramatized in the book and film, &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot;. Kravis was portrayed in the film by actor Jonathan Pryce.

In early 1995, KKR divested its remaining holdings in RJR Nabisco, taking an overall loss on the deal. A journalist for the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote a few years later that &quot;the deal will go down in history as showing just how difficult it can be to get out of a huge deal that goes badly, and of the perils of putting too much money on one investment.&quot; KKR pledged not to commit so much of its fund to a single investment again in the future. However, other investments proved more profitable, and the fund still did well overall.

The list of companies in which Henry Kravis&#x27;s KKR has invested over the years includes health care provider Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), TXU, Playtex, Beatrice Foods, Safeway, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Borden, First Data and Regal Entertainment Group. A takeover of the battery maker Duracell proved particularly profitable.

On December 24, 2013, KKR closed their first real estate specific investment fund, which raised $1.2 billion of new money to invest. With additional funds from within KKR, the new fund provided over $1.5 billion to utilize.

In July 2017, Kravis and Roberts announced that they would eventually be succeeded by Joseph Y. Bae and Scott C. Nuttall, who were named co-presidents and co-chief operating officers so that they might gradually take over daily operations. This succession plan was enacted in October 2021, with Kravis and Roberts stepping down from their positions as co-CEOs but continuing as co-executive chairmen.

==Personal life==
Kravis has been married three times. His first marriage to Helene Diane &quot;Hedi&quot; Shulman ended in divorce. They had three children, Harrison S. Kravis (b. 1972, d. 1991 car accident), Robert R. Kravis (b. 1973), and Kimberly Kravis Schulhof (b. 1975). Hedi remarried to James Thompson Ruger, son of William B. Ruger and died of cancer on April 2, 1997, at age 49. Kravis later married New York designer Carolyne Roehm (born Carolyne Jane Smith) in 1985, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1993. Kravis is currently married to a prominent Canadian economist, and former columnist and TV personality in Canada, Marie-Josée Drouin. She sits on the boards of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the Robin Hood Foundation, and is the president of the Museum of Modern Art board of directors.

Kravis mainly lives in New York City and has a seasonal residence in Palm Beach, Florida; he also owns homes in New York City; Southampton, New York; Paris; and Sharon, Connecticut.

===Politics===
A supporter of Republican politics, he was a supporter and fundraiser for President George W. Bush and John McCain. He was also a major contributor to the 1992 re-election campaign of President George H. W. Bush. In 1997, Henry Kravis joined with Lewis M. Eisenberg to establish the Republican Leadership Council. In 2017, he also contributed $1 million to President Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential inauguration.

The Henry R. Kravis Prize in Nonprofit Leadership, established in 2006, identifies extraordinary leaders in the nonprofit sector, celebrates their accomplishments and shares their best practices with others. The prize is presented and administered by Claremont McKenna College (CMC) and Marie-Josée and Henry Kravis. Kravis is an alumnus and trustee of Claremont McKenna College. The Kravis Prize is affiliated with the Kravis Leadership Institute, a research institute at Claremont McKenna.

Kravis also funds the Henry Kravis Leadership Institute that sponsors the Leadership Studies programs at Claremont McKenna College, and the &quot;Henry Kravis Internships for Teachers of Color&quot; program. He has also financed the construction of extensive facilities at Middlesex School (Kravis House), the Eaglebrook School (Kravis Dorm), Deerfield Academy (Kravis Arena), and The Loomis Chaffee School (Kravis Hall).

Kravis is a benefactor and a past chairman of New York&#x27;s public television station and sits on the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A trustee of the Mount Sinai Medical Center, Henry and wife Marie-Josée Kravis donated $15 million to establish the &quot;Center for Cardiovascular Health&quot; as well as funding a professorship. They have also endowed the chair in human oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

Kravis previously co-chaired with Jerry Speyer the influential Partnership for New York City, founded by David Rockefeller in 1979, and now sits on its board of directors. He created the New York City Investment Fund, a non-profit organization to create jobs and new business in New York City.

<doc id="435602" wikidata="Q268613" url="?curid=435602" title="African Christian Democratic Party">
<text>The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) is a South African political party founded in 1993. It is a conservative Christian party based on Biblical principles. The leader of the party is Kenneth Meshoe.

Following the 2016 municipal elections, the ACDP joined with the much larger Democratic Alliance (DA) and several other smaller parties to form coalition governments in Nelson Mandela Bay, Johannesburg and Tshwane.

As of 2024, the ACDP has three members in the South African Parliament, and one member each in the provincial legislatures of Western Cape, and Gauteng. It also has 22 municipal councillors across the country.

In June 2024, ACDP was offered an opportunity to be part of Government of National Unity (GNU), but the party decided to stay out of the new government.

==Policy==
The party&#x27;s 2019 manifesto focused on seven social challenges, under the slogan &quot;Unite - Build - Grow&quot;: employment, economic growth, education, health, safety &amp; security, good governance and property rights &amp; rural development.

The party seeks to apply Biblical principles &quot;to build a better South Africa.&quot; Its platform is based on &quot;the biblical standard of reconciliation, justice, compassion, tolerance, peace and the sanctity of life, the individual, the family and community.&quot;

It is anti-abortion and supports the death penalty for certain heinous crimes.

The ACDP was the only party to vote against the adoption of the final version of the South African Constitution, for reason that it enshrined the right to elective abortion and the specific protection of sexual orientation.

Its 2000 manifesto opposed the promotion of condoms and safe sex as a way of preventing HIV transmission: &quot;The ACDP feel strongly that the condom campaign must be abandoned and that abstinence and faithfulness in marriage must be promoted.&quot; The party supports an abstinence-only policy.

The party opposed the provision of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 which reduced the homosexual age of consent from 19 to 16, making it equal to the heterosexual age of consent.

==History==
According to newspaper reports at the time, the ACDP was founded on 9 December 1993. The party claims on its web site, however, that it was founded on 16 or 17 January 1994 (i.e. exactly one hundred days before South Africa&#x27;s 1994 national elections). This is because the party&#x27;s first official congress took place 100 days before the elections. The party&#x27;s original manifesto included Christian norms, religious freedom, a freemarket system, and human rights under a federal governmental system.

== Election results ==
In its first election, the ACDP secured two seats in the national government. This made the ACDP the smallest of the seven parties in the national government of 1994. They also secured three seats in the provincial government. A year later, the ACDP won three seats in local government elections. From 1994 to 1999, four councillors from other political parties crossed the floor to join the ACDP.

In 1999, the ACDP won seven seats to become the sixth-largest party in Parliament. The party also won its first seat on the National Council of Provinces. On the provincial level, the party won four seats. A year later, the ACDP won 70 seats in the local government elections.

In 2004, the ACDP won 1.6% of the votes at national level and 1.59% of the votes at provincial level. They were now the seventh largest party, with seven seats in the National Assembly and eight seats at provincial level.

The party lost 50% of its support in the 2009 elections and continued to lose support in the 2014 elections, where it won three seats to slip to the ninth-largest party, as well as one provincial seat in the Western Cape.

In 2019, the party secured its best result since 2004, winning 0.84% of the votes at the national level. It became the sixth-largest party, with four seats in the National Assembly and three provincial seats: one each in Western Cape, Kwazulu-Natal and Gauteng.

<text>MacDraw is a discontinued vector graphics drawing application released along with the first Apple Macintosh systems in 1984. MacDraw was one of the first WYSIWYG drawing programs that could be used in collaboration with MacWrite. It was eventually adapted by Claris and, in the early 1990s, MacDraw Pro was released with color support.
MacDraw was the vector-based cousin of MacPaint.

In the preface of the third edition of &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot;, the authors make an emphatic plea for the creation of an OS X-compatible version of MacDraw Pro.

== Early versions ==
MacDraw was based on Apple&#x27;s earlier program, LisaDraw, which was developed for the Apple Lisa computer which was released in 1983. LisaDraw and MacDraw were developed by the same person, Mark Cutter.

The first version of MacDraw was similar to that of MacPaint, featuring the same tools and patterns. However, MacDraw is vector-based, meaning that an object&#x27;s properties and placement can be changed at any time. MacDraw includes features for printing and also integrates with MacWrite via cut-and-paste. MacDraw is more advanced than MacPaint, featuring a grid and the ability to change the drawing dimensions. However, MacDraw lacks support for using more than one document at a time and also lacks zooming capabilities. MacDraw is especially useful in drawing flowcharts, diagrams and technical drawings.

== Later incarnations ==
MacDraw II (1988) was a complete rewrite of the original MacDraw. It was developed at Apple by project leader Gerard Schutten and team members Amy Goldsmith and Marjory Kaptanoglu, and was released by Claris. MacDraw II introduced color and many other missing features and was also enhanced for the Macintosh II. MacDraw eventually evolved into MacDraw Pro (1991) and ultimately ClarisDraw (1993). The final version of ClarisDraw was 1.0v4 (1994). It runs without difficulties on PowerPC-based Macs under Classic Mac OS and the Mac OS X Classic Environment (which is included in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and earlier).

Dekorra Optics have a version of their EazyDraw software, EazyDraw Retro, that can open documents produced by the various incarnations of MacDraw, including ClarisDraw. Later versions of LibreOffice support MacDraw files as well, but only if the file type &#x27;Legacy Mac Drawing&#x27; is manually selected.

<text>&quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; is a song originally written and first recorded in 1939 by Solomon Linda under the title &quot;Mbube&quot;, through South African Gallo Record Company. In 1961, a version adapted into English by the doo-wop group the Tokens became a number-one hit in the United States. It earned millions in royalties from cover versions and film licensing. Lyrics of Linda&#x27;s original version were written in Zulu, while those from the Tokens&#x27; adaptation were written by George David Weiss. 

The song has been adapted and covered internationally by many pop and folk artists. It was first recorded in the United States by the Weavers in November 1951, and published under the title &quot;Wimoweh&quot; by a branch of Folkways Records in December of the same year. The pop group Tight Fit made a cover of the song in 1982, reaching number one hit in the UK. Other artists who have recorded various versions of the song include R.E.M., NSYNC, Henri Salvador, Karl Denver, Jimmy Dorsey, Yma Sumac, Noro Morales, Roy Zimmerman, Miriam Makeba, and The Kingston Trio. The song is in the key of F major.

==History==

The original song title was &quot;Mbube&quot; (the Zulu word for &quot;lion&quot;) and was written and first recorded in 1939 by Solomon Linda, a South African Zulu singer, who worked for the Gallo Record Company in Johannesburg as a cleaner and record packer. He spent his weekends performing with his musical ensemble, &quot;The Evening Birds&quot;, and it was at this record label, under the direction of producer &quot;Griffiths Motsieloa&quot;, that Linda and his fellow musicians recorded several songs, including &quot;Mbube&quot;, which incorporated a call and response pattern common among many Sub-Saharan African ethnic groups, including the Zulu. 

According to journalist Rian Malan: &quot;&#x27;Mbube&#x27; wasn&#x27;t the most remarkable tune, but there was something terribly compelling about the underlying chant, a dense meshing of low male voices above which Solomon yodeled and howled for two exhilarating minutes, occasionally making it up as he went along. The third take was the great one, but it achieved immortality only in its dying seconds, when Solly took a deep breath, opened his mouth and improvised the melody...&quot;

Issued as a 78-rpm phonograph record and marketed to black audiences, &quot;Mbube&quot; became a hit and Linda a star throughout South Africa. By 1948, the song had sold over 100,000 copies in Africa and among black South African immigrants in Great Britain. Linda&#x27;s song also gave the name to a style of African a cappella music that evolved into &quot;Isicathamiya&quot; (also called &quot;Mbube music&quot;), popularized by the group Ladysmith Black Mambazo.

In 1949 Alan Lomax, then working as folk music director for Decca Records, brought Solomon Linda&#x27;s 78-rpm recording to the attention of his friend Pete Seeger, leader of the folk group The Weavers. In November 1951, after having performed the song for at least a year in their concerts, The Weavers recorded an adapted version with brass, string orchestra and chorus and released it as a 78-rpm single titled &quot;Wimoweh&quot;, a mishearing of the original song&#x27;s chorus of &quot;Uyimbube&quot; (&quot;You are a lion&quot; in Zulu). Their version contained the chanting chorus &quot;Wimoweh&quot; and Linda&#x27;s improvised line. The Weavers credited the song as &quot;Oral tradition&quot;, with arrangement by &quot;Paul Campbell&quot;, later found to be a pseudonym used by The Weavers in order to claim royalties. It reached &quot;Billboard&quot;″s top ten and became a staple of The Weavers&#x27; live repertoire, achieving further exposure on their best-selling &quot;The Weavers at Carnegie Hall&quot; LP album, recorded in 1955 and released in 1957. 

Exotica singer Yma Sumac covered the song, for which Juilliard School-trained songwriter George David Weiss brought in soprano Anita Darian to let her perform before, during and after the soprano saxophone solo in such version, issued in 1952 on Capitol Records. The song was recorded extensively by other folk revival groups such as the Kingston Trio, who released it in 1958. 

Miriam Makeba also covered the song in 1960, with the original title &quot;Mbube&quot; and giving writing credits to &quot;J. Linda&quot;. In 1961, two RCA Records producers, Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore, hired Weiss to arrange a Doo-wop and Rhythm and blues cover of &quot;Wimoweh&quot; for the B-side of a 45-rpm single called &quot;Tina&quot;, sung by group The Tokens. Weiss wrote the English lines &quot;In the jungle, the mighty jungle, The lion sleeps tonight...&quot; and &quot;Hush, my darling, don&#x27;t fear, my darling...&quot;. &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; was issued by RCA in that year, and it rocketed to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Weiss&#x27; &quot;Abilene Music, Inc.&quot; was the publisher of this arrangement, and listed &quot;Albert Stanton&quot; (a pseudonym for &quot;Al Brackman&quot;, the business partner of Pete Seeger&#x27;s music publisher, Howie Richmond) as one of the song&#x27;s writers or arrangers.

== Copyright issues ==
Social historian Ronald D. Cohen writes: &quot;Howie Richmond copyrighted many songs originally in the public domain but now slightly revised to satisfy Decca and also to reap profits&quot;. Howie Richmond&#x27;s claim of author&#x27;s copyright could secure both the songwriter&#x27;s royalties and his company&#x27;s publishing share of the song earnings.

Although Solomon Linda was listed as a performer on the record itself, The Weavers thought they had recorded a traditional Zulu song. Their managers, the publisher, and their attorneys knew otherwise because they had been contacted by — and had reached an agreement with — Eric Gallo of Gallo Record Company in South Africa. The Americans maintained, however, that South African copyrights were not valid because South Africa was not a signatory to U.S. copyright law. In the 1950s, after Linda&#x27;s authorship was made clear, Pete Seeger sent $1000 to the South African artist. The folk singer also said he instructed &quot;TRO/Folkways&quot; to henceforth pay his share of authors&#x27; earnings to Linda. Seeger apparently trusted his publisher&#x27;s word of honor and either saw no need, or was unable, to make sure these instructions to be carried out.

In 2000, South African journalist Rian Malan wrote a feature article for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in which he recounted Linda&#x27;s story and estimated that the song had earned $15 million for its use in the Disney 1994 movie &quot;The Lion King&quot; alone. The piece prompted filmmaker François Verster to create the Emmy-winning documentary &quot;A Lion&#x27;s Trail&quot;, released in 2002, which tells Linda&#x27;s story while incidentally exposing the workings of the multi-million dollar corporate music publishing industry. In 2003 a CGI animation French TV series, &quot;Pat &amp; Stan&quot;, created by Pierre Coffin who also created &quot;Despicable Me&quot;, features protagonists, a brown hippopotamus and a yellow dog, singing &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;. It marked the two&#x27;s debut appearance and was the pilot episode to ITV&#x27;s shorts and the sketch of the same name.

In July 2004, as a result of the publicity generated by Malan&#x27;s article and the subsequent documentary, the song became the subject of a lawsuit between Linda&#x27;s estate and Disney, claiming that the latter owed $1.6 million in royalties for the use of &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; in the film and musical stage productions of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. At the same time, the &quot;Richmond Organization&quot; began to pay $3,000 annually to the Linda&#x27;s estate. In February 2006, the South African singer&#x27;s descendants reached a legal settlement with &quot;Abilene Music Publishers&quot;, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney, to place the earnings of the song in a trust.

In 2012, &quot;Mbube&quot; fell into the public domain, owing to the copyright law of South Africa, while &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; is still in copyright. The copyright issues were also treated in the 2019 movie &quot;&quot;.

<text>In the United States, a recess appointment is an appointment by the president of a federal official when the U.S. Senate is in recess. Under the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Appointments Clause, the president is empowered to nominate, and with the advice and consent (confirmation) of the Senate, make appointments to high-level policy-making positions in federal departments, agencies, boards, and commissions, as well as to the federal judiciary. A recess appointment under Article II, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution is an alternative method of appointing officials that allows the temporary filling of offices during periods when the Senate is not in session. It was anticipated that the Senate would be away for months at a time, so the ability to fill vacancies in important positions when the Senate is in recess and unavailable to provide advice and consent was deemed essential to maintain government function, as described by Alexander Hamilton in No. 67 of &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;.

In modern times, the Senate is in session nearly year-round, making the recess appointment mechanism far less necessary or useful for upkeep of government function. Nonetheless, in recent times this power has also been controversially used as a political tool to temporarily install an unpopular nominee by sidestepping the Senate&#x27;s role in the confirmation process; the Senate has taken measures from time to time to prevent a president from making recess appointments, specifically by holding &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions. The Supreme Court affirmed that &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions are sufficient to prevent recess appointments and addressed other intricacies of the practice in &quot;NLRB v. Noel Canning&quot; (2014). Appointments made during a recess must be confirmed by the Senate by the end of the next session of Congress, or the appointment expires. In current practice, this means that a recess appointment must be approved by roughly the end of the next calendar year and thus could last for almost two years, if made early enough in the year. In situations where a recess appointment is prevented, a lower official frequently assumes the duties of the position in an acting role.

==Constitutional text==
Article II, Section 2, Clause 3, commonly known as the &quot;Recess Appointment Clause&quot;, provides that,
==History==

Presidents since George Washington have made recess appointments. Washington appointed South Carolina judge John Rutledge as Chief Justice of the United States during a congressional recess in 1795. Because of Rutledge&#x27;s political views and occasional mental illness, however, the Senate rejected his nomination, and Rutledge attempted suicide and resigned. Almost every president has used recess appointments to appoint judges, over 300 such judicial recess appointments before 2000, including ten Supreme Court justices.

New Jersey judge William J. Brennan was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 by a recess appointment. This was done in part with an eye on the presidential campaign that year; Eisenhower was running for reelection, and his advisors thought it would be politically advantageous to place a northeastern Catholic on the court. Brennan was promptly confirmed when the Senate came back into session. Eisenhower, in a recess appointment, also designated Charles W. Yost as United States Ambassador to Syria. Eisenhower made two other recess appointments, Chief Justice Earl Warren and Associate Justice Potter Stewart.

As reported by Adam Serwer, writing for &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) talliedPresident Ronald Reagan ma[king] 240 recess appointments [during his time in office], [and] President George H. W. Bush ma[king] 77 recess appointments...

George H. W. Bush appointed Lawrence Eagleburger as Secretary of State during a recess in 1992; Eagleburger, as Deputy Secretary of State, had in effect filled that role after James Baker resigned.

Henry B. Hogue, a specialist in American national government, summarised the next presidents for the CRS, statingPresident William J. Clinton made 139 recess appointments [during his presidency], 95 to full-time positions and 44 to part-time positions. President George W. Bush made 171 recess appointments, 99 to full-time positions and 72 to part-time positions.
During the last two years of the Bush administration, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sought to prevent recess appointments. Bush promised not to make any during the August recess that year, but no agreement was reached for the two-week Thanksgiving break in November 2007. As a result, Reid did not allow adjournments of more than three days from then until the end of the Bush presidency by holding &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions. Prior to this, there had been speculation that James W. Holsinger would receive a recess appointment as Surgeon General of the United States.

President Barack Obama made 32 recess appointments (through February 1, 2015), all to full-time
positions. Over what would have traditionally been the 2011–12 winter recess of the 112th Congress, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives did not assent to recess, specifically to block Richard Cordray&#x27;s appointment as Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Both the House and Senate continued to hold &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions.

In August 2017, nine &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions were set up to block President Donald Trump from making recess appointments; the concern was that Trump might dismiss Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and try to name his successor while Congress was in recess. &quot;Pro forma&quot; sessions continued to be held until January 2019: they were held on December 31, 2018, and again on January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, that lasted several minutes.

On April 15, 2020, while Congress was holding &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions due to the recess during the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump threatened to adjourn both houses of Congress in order to make recess appointments for vacant positions such as the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Director of National Intelligence. However, the U.S. Constitution only grants the president the authority to adjourn Congress if it is unable to agree on a date of adjournment, and both Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that they would not alter the planned date of January 3, 2021.

==Congressional action to prevent recess appointments==
The Senate or House may seek to block potential recess appointments by not allowing the Senate to adjourn under Article 1, Section 5, Clause 4 of the Constitution, which provides that both Houses must consent to an adjournment. This tactic is especially used when either House of Congress is controlled by a different party than that of the president, the Senate or House may seek to block potential recess appointments by not allowing the Senate to adjourn for more than three days, blocking a longer adjournment that would allow recess appointments to be made.

In order to combat this tactic from Congress, the president can adjourn Congress under Article II section 3 of the Constitution, which states:He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, &quot;and in case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper;&quot; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and shall commission all the officers of the United States. [emphasis added]

According to Article II Section 2 of the Constitution, the president can appoint or fill up the vacancies that happen during a recess without the Senate&#x27;s approval, but those positions will end at the end of the next legislative session unless Congress approves the appointment:The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.

===Legality of intra-session appointments===
As noted by D.R. Stras and R.W. Scott, writing in 2007 in the &quot;Northwestern University Law Review&quot;, &quot;there is a robust debate in the scholarly literature about the meaning of the Recess Appointments Clause.&quot; In Federalist No. 67, Alexander Hamilton wrote:The ordinary power of appointment is confined to the President and Senate &quot;jointly&quot;, and can therefore only be exercised during the session of the Senate; but as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually in session for the appointment of officers and as vacancies might happen &quot;in their recess&quot;, which it might be necessary for the public service to fill without delay.

Michael B. Rappaport, writing in 2005 in the &quot;UCLA Law Review&quot;, argues for a revised understanding of the meaning of the word &quot;recess&quot; in the Clause, and that it permits appointments &quot;only when an office becomes vacant during a recess and when the... appointment is made during that recess&quot;; he goes on to state that &quot;if an office is vacant while the Senate is in session, the Constitution expects the President to make an advice and consent appointment at that time.&quot;

Historically, presidents tended to make recess appointments when the Senate was adjourned for lengthy periods. Since World War II, presidents have sometimes made recess appointments when Senate opposition appeared strong in the hope that appointees might prove themselves in office and then allow opposition to dissipate.

According to Henry B. Hogue, writing for the Congressional Research Service:Recent Presidents have made both intersession and intrasession recess appointments [those between sessions/Congresses and those within sessions, respectively]. Intrasession recess appointments were unusual, however, prior to the 1940s, in part because intrasession recesses were less common at that time. Intrasession recess appointments have sometimes provoked controversy in the Senate, and some academic literature also has called their legitimacy into question. Legal opinions have also varied on this issue over time.

Others argue that recess appointments were to be made only during inter-session recesses, which during the early days of the country lasted between six and nine months, and were therefore required to prevent important offices from remaining unfilled for long periods. The view holds that the current interpretation allows appointments to be made during recesses too brief to justify bypassing the Senate.

Most recently, however, as partisanship on Capitol Hill has grown, recess appointments have tended to solidify opposition to the appointee.

===Obama&#x27;s challenge ===
Regardless of the Senate continuing to hold pro forma sessions, on January 4, 2012, President Obama appointed Richard Cordray and others as recess appointments. White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler asserted that the appointments were valid, because the &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions were designed to, &quot;through form, render a constitutional power of the executive obsolete&quot; and that the Senate was for all intents and purposes recessed. Republicans in the Senate disputed the appointments, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that Obama had &quot;arrogantly circumvented the American people&quot; with the appointments. It was expected that there would be a legal challenge to the appointments.

On January 6, 2012, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion regarding recess appointments and pro forma sessions, claiming, &quot;The convening of periodic pro forma sessions in which no business is to be conducted does not have the legal effect of interrupting an intrasession recess otherwise long enough to qualify as a &quot;Recess of the Senate&quot; under the Recess Appointments Clause. In this context, the President therefore has discretion to conclude that the Senate is unavailable to perform its advise-and-consent function and to exercise his power to make recess appointments&quot;.

===Judicial challenges===
However, this was widely disputed. The first such challenge was announced in April 2012, disputing a National Labor Relations Board ruling made following the Obama appointments.

On January 25, 2013, in the first circuit case to rule on the validity of the January 4, 2012, appointments, Chief Judge David Sentelle, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, wrote &quot;an interpretation of &#x27;the Recess&#x27; that permits the President to decide when the Senate is in recess would demolish the checks and balances inherent in the advice-and-consent requirement, giving the President free rein to appoint his desired nominees at any time he pleases, whether that time be a weekend, lunch, or even when the Senate is in session and he is merely displeased with its inaction. This cannot be the law.&quot;

Also, on March 16, 2013, the Third Circuit joined the D.C. Circuit and held that the March 2010 appointment of Craig Becker to the NLRB was invalid because he was not appointed between sessions.

On June 26, 2014, in a 9–0 ruling on the case of NLRB v. Noel Canning, the United States Supreme Court validated this practice of using pro forma sessions to block the president from using the recess appointment authority. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that the Constitution allows for the Congress itself to determine its sessions and recesses, that &quot;the Senate is in session when it says it is&quot;, and that the President does not have the unilateral right to dictate Congressional sessions and thus make recess appointments. However, the decision allows the use of recess appointments during breaks within a session for vacancies that existed prior to the break. Justice Breyer also noted that the president could force a recess if he had enough congressional support: &quot;The Constitution also gives the President (if he has enough allies in Congress) a way to force a recess. Art. II, §3 (&#x27;[I]n Case of Disagreement between [the Houses], with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, [the President] may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper&#x27;). Moreover, the president and Senators engage with each other in many different ways [*28] and have a variety of methods of encouraging each other to accept their points of view. Regardless, the Recess Appointments Clause is not designed to overcome serious institutional friction. It simply provides a subsidiary method for appointing officials when the Senate is away during a recess.&quot;

<doc id="435609" wikidata="Q1380250" url="?curid=435609" title="USS Louisville (SSN-724)">
<text>USS &quot;Louisville&quot; (SSN-724), a &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine, is the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Louisville, Kentucky. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 11 February 1982 and her keel was laid on 24 September 1984. She was launched on 14 December 1985—sponsored by Mrs. Betty Ann McKee (née Harris), wife of Admiral Kinnaird McKee, Director of Naval Nuclear Propulsion —and commissioned on 8 November 1986 with Captain Charles E. Ellis in command.

&quot;Louisville&quot; serves as a trial platform for the prototype BQQ-10 ARCI sonars, which incorporate off-the-shelf computer components, allowing easy introduction of modular upgrades.

==Service history==
&quot;Louisville&quot; transited the Panama Canal in January 1987 to make her home base at Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego as a part of Submarine Squadron 11.

During her stay at San Diego, &quot;Louisville&quot; conducted several WestPac deployments. During her 1988–1989 Westpac deployment, &quot;Louisville&quot; visited Korea, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, and Guam.

In January and February 1991, as Operation Desert Storm began, &quot;Louisville&quot; carried out the first war patrol conducted by an American submarine since World War II. The patrol began with a 14,000-mile submerged, high-speed transit across the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean to the Red Sea. Shortly after noon on 19 January, she launched Tomahawk cruise missiles against targets in Iraq, becoming the first submarine to launch Tomahawks in combat. For this war patrol, &quot;Louisville&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation.

In 2003, &quot;Louisville&quot; participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom, launching 16 Tomahawk missiles from the Red Sea against targets in Iraq. Her deployment was extended to eight and a half months in support of the campaign. She was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her role in the operation.

&quot;Louisville&quot; completed an extensive overhaul in Portsmouth, NH, at the end of 2008. She returned to her homeport of Pearl Harbor in the spring of 2009 as a part of CSS-3.

&quot;Louisville&quot; received Meritorious Unit Commendations for both her 2014-15 and 2016-17 Western Pacific deployments. In 2017, she completed a surge U.S. Southern Command deployment to participate in the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Chile&#x27;s submarine force. In so doing, she made history as the first nuclear-powered warship to call at Talcahuano, Chile.

Following a final U.S. Central Command deployment from 2018 to 2019, &quot;Louisville&quot; changed homeport in October 2019 to Bremerton, Washington for decommissioning. She was placed out of service on 6 August 2020, and scheduled for formal decommissioning on 9 March 2021. Like all other recent U.S. submarines, the vessel will be recycled via the Navy&#x27;s Ship-Submarine Recycling Program.

&quot;Louisville&quot; was decommissioned on 9 March 2021 at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard &amp; Intermediate Maintenance Facility.

<doc id="435614" wikidata="Q677182" url="?curid=435614" title="Democratic Beginning">
<text>Democratic Beginning () was an East German political movement and political party that was active during the Revolutions of 1989 and in the period leading up to the German reunification. While it was a relatively minor party, it took part in the first democratically elected government in East Germany in 1990, and is especially known because future Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel started her political career within the party.

It was founded on 29 October 1989, based on existing politically active church groups. Founding members included Wolfgang Schnur, Friedrich Schorlemmer, Rainer Eppelmann, Günter Nooke and Thomas Welz. The organisation became a political party on December 16/17, 1989 in Leipzig. The party convention adopted a more conservative program than some of the founding members, like Schorlemmer, were willing to bear, so they left the party. Others, like Nooke, who left some time later, resented the growing cooperation with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of East Germany, which had been a member of the Communist-dominated National Front of parties and mass organisations that had supported the Communist regime.

Democratic Beginning now supported rapid German reunification and joined the Alliance for Germany (&quot;Allianz für Deutschland&quot;) along with the CDU and German Social Union (DSU) for the 1990 Volkskammer elections on March 18. Only a few days prior to the elections, party chairman Schnur had to confess to having been an informer for the Ministry for State Security (Stasi), and resigned. Although Alliance for Germany won the elections, Democratic Beginning only collected 0.9% of votes, amounting to four seats in the Volkskammer. Eppelmann became minister for disarmament and defense in the new government and new party chairman. On 4 August 1990, Democratic Beginning ceased to exist after merging into the East German CDU, which in turn on 3 October 1990 merged into its West German counterpart, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).

From February 1990, Angela Merkel served as the party&#x27;s spokeswoman. After the mergers, Merkel was elected in the post-unification election as a member of the all-German Bundestag for the CDU, was immediately appointed a minister in Helmut Kohl&#x27;s government as a form of East German representation, became party chairwoman in 2000 and eventually Chancellor of Germany in 2005.

<doc id="435615" wikidata="Q1460677" url="?curid=435615" title="General People's Congress (Yemen)">
<text>The General People&#x27;s Congress (GPC; ) is a political party in Yemen. It has been the &quot;de jure&quot; ruling party of Yemen since 1993, three years after unification. The party is dominated by a nationalist line, and its official ideology is Arab nationalism, seeking Arab unity. 

In the course of the Yemeni Civil War, the party&#x27;s founder and Leader Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed, while the GPC fractured into three factions backing different sides in the conflict. 

==History==
The party was established on 24 August 1982 in Sana&#x27;a, North Yemen, by President Ali Abdullah Saleh, becoming an umbrella organisation that sought to represent all political interests. Following Yemeni unification in 1990, and with Saleh continuing as president of the united country, it emerged as the largest party in the 1993 parliamentary elections, winning 123 of the 301 seats. It went on to win a majority (187) of seats in the 1997 elections amidst a boycott by the Yemeni Socialist Party.

Saleh was re-elected as president in the first direct presidential elections in 1999, and the party won a landslide victory in the 2003 parliamentary elections, winning 226 of the 301 seats. Following the elections, several independent MPs also joined the party. Saleh was re-elected again in 2006. After he was forced to stand down as a result of the Yemeni Revolution, the party&#x27;s Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi was elected as his successor. Saleh attempted to regain power over the country and the GPC in the following civil war. Rallying a large part of the GPC in 2015, he sided with the Houthis and effectively split the party into a pro-Hadi and Saleh faction.

The two factions were at war with each other until Saleh attempted to overthrow the Houthis. This power grab failed, however, and the former president as well as party secretary general Aref al-Zouka were killed in the Battle of Sana&#x27;a of late 2017. Following Ali Abdullah Saleh&#x27;s death, the GPC fractured further, with a large part of the former Saleh followers pledging allegiance to the Houthis. This pro-Houthi part of the GPC continued to support the rebel government in Sana&#x27;a, and elected Sadeq Ameen Abu Rass as the new GPC chairman. One member of the pro-Houthi faction explained that &quot;Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed by the Houthis. If we follow his direction and resist the Houthis, we will meet the same end as Saleh. So we prefer to support the strongest force on the ground.&quot;

Another group of Saleh loyalists fled from the Houthis. Though this GPC faction then allied itself with Hadi and the Saudi Arabia-led international coalition, it still remained completely separate and chose Ali Abdullah Saleh&#x27;s son Ahmed Saleh as new &quot;de facto&quot; leader. Meanwhile, the former president&#x27;s nephew Tareq Saleh began to organize a new private army for this GPC faction.

<text>Hanukkah Harry is a fictional character on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; played by Jon Lovitz.

Hanukkah Harry is portrayed on the show as a variation upon the modern-day image of Santa Claus, with a beard characteristic of a male adherent of Haredi Judaism, and with his hat in blue with white edges (the colors of an Ashkenazi Jewish &quot;tallit&quot;, or prayer shawl, shared by the flag of Israel).

==&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;==

Hanukkah Harry&#x27;s first appearance on &quot;SNL&quot; was on Season 15: Episode 9, a show first broadcast on December 16, 1989, with guest host Andie MacDowell, in a sketch titled &quot;The Night Hanukkah Harry Saved Christmas&quot;, that viewers are told is sponsored by Hallmark Cards in association with the Jewish Anti-Defamation League. Unable to deliver toys to children due to a stomach virus, Santa calls Hanukkah Harry (Jon Lovitz) at his workshop on Mount Sinai, asking if he could fill in. Hanukkah Harry agrees and flies through the air on a cart pulled by three donkeys, Moische, Herschel and Schlomo. Hanukkah Harry lands on a roof and climbs down the chimney of the home of Scott (Mike Myers) and Christine (Victoria Jackson), offering gifts of slacks and socks respectively, as well as chocolate coins and a dreidel. While the children are initially disappointed at their gifts, their realization that Hanukkah Harry had helped Santa, makes them recognize that &quot;Christians and Jews, deep down, are pretty much the same. Maybe that&#x27;s the true meaning of Christmas!&quot; With that statement Santa&#x27;s flu is cured, and Santa comes down the chimney bearing gifts of Barbie make-me-pretty for Christine and a pellet gun for Scott.

Hanukkah Harry&#x27;s second appearance on &quot;SNL&quot; was on Season 15: Episode 17, with guest host Corbin Bernsen, first broadcast on April 14, 1990, in a sketch titled &quot;The Night Hanukkah Harry Saved Easter.&quot;

The definitive scholarly and popular treatment of Hanukkah Harry appears in the book &quot;A Kosher Christmas: &#x27;Tis the Season to Be Jewish&quot; by Rabbi Joshua Eli Plaut, Ph.D. in the fourth chapter entitled “ `Twas the Night Before Hanukkah: Remaking Christmas Through Parody and Popular Culture.” Plaut details and analyzes how Hannukah Harry becomes an American folk hero as a counterpart to Santa Claus.

==Other appearances==
Building on these two &quot;SNL&quot; appearances, Hanukkah Harry has been referenced as a personification of Hanukkah to correspond to Santa Claus in various other media, including on National Public Radio, and on the pages of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in which Jonathan Safran Foer satirically described him as &quot;a real person who drops in on Jewish homes each of the eights nights of Hanukkah to deliver gifts that are in no way dependent on children&#x27;s good behavior&quot;.

&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; has called Hanukkah Harry one of the best &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketches of all time.

&quot;Dollface&quot; Izzy dressed as Hanukkah Harry in the episode &quot;History Buff&quot;.

&quot;The Goldbergs (season 3)&quot; Episode 10, Hanukkah Harry appears as a character played by George Segal as Albert &#x27;Pops&#x27; Solomon.

<text>The Alliance for Germany () was an opposition coalition in East Germany. It was formed on 5 February 1990 in Berlin (then West Berlin) to stand in the East-German Volkskammer elections.

It consisted of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Democratic Awakening (DA) and the German Social Union (DSU). The German Forum Party was invited to join, but declined.

The Alliance won the most votes in the 1990 East German general election, winning 48.2% of votes cast (CDU 40.9%; DSU 6.3%; DA 0.9%), and would control 192 of 400 seats in the Volkskammer.

<text>Patrick John Mercer (born 26 June 1956) is a British author and former politician. He was elected as a Conservative in the 2001 general election, until resigning the party&#x27;s parliamentary whip in May 2013 following questions surrounding paid advocacy, and was an Independent MP representing the constituency of Newark in Parliament until his resignation at the end of April 2014 when a Standards Committee report recommended suspending him for six months for &quot;sustained and pervasive breach of the house&#x27;s rules&quot;. He was Conservative shadow homeland security minister from 2003 to 2007, when David Cameron forced him to resign after he had made remarks about racism which Cameron found unacceptable.

Mercer is a frequent commentator on defence and security issues, having served as a colonel in the British Army and as a BBC journalist. He has to date written four military novels and is a patron of the Victoria Cross Trust.

==Early life and education==
Born in Stockport in Cheshire in 1956, Mercer is the son of Eric Mercer, who became Bishop of Exeter. His mother was born in Lincolnshire and his father was trained for the priesthood at Kelham Theological College near Newark.

Mercer was educated at The King&#x27;s School, Chester, and Exeter College, Oxford, where he read history. He was later commissioned after training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Whilst there, he was one of a number of cadets interviewed for an edition of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; programme.

==British Army career==
Mercer followed his father, who saw wartime service in the Sherwood Foresters (Notts &amp; Derby Regiment), into the British Army. He was commissioned into the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment on 8 March 1975 as a second lieutenant. His service number was 499748. On 8 March 1977, he was promoted to lieutenant. He was promoted to captain on 8 September 1981, and to major on 30 September 1988. On 30 June 1994, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, then to colonel on 30 June 1998.

During his time in the Army, Mercer completed nine tours in Northern Ireland and latterly commanded his battalion in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada and Tidworth. Mercer served at both the Staff College, Camberley, and the Army&#x27;s University at Cranfield.

Mercer was Mentioned in Despatches in 1983 for &quot;gallant and distinguished service in Northern Ireland during the period 1 November 1982 to 31 January 1983&quot;. He earned a gallantry commendation in 1990. He was made an MBE on 12 October 1993 &quot;in recognition of distinguished service in Northern Ireland&quot;. He was made an OBE on 13 May 1997 &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the former Yugoslavia during the period 21 June to 20 December 1996&quot;. He left the Army in 1999 as a colonel, He retired from the army on 1 September 1999, his last posting having been as head of communications and strategy at the Army Training and Recruiting Agency.

==Journalism==
After leaving the Army, Mercer was a defence reporter for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme. He reported from trouble spots, including Kosovo.

On being selected as Conservative candidate in Newark, Mercer left the BBC and became a freelance journalist writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He continued to contribute to radio, television, and print media, mainly on security and defence issues, and in &quot;The House magazine&quot; in 2009 his profession was stated as Journalist.

==Political career==
===Parliament from 2001===
Mercer was first elected to Parliament as the member for Newark at the 2001 general election, defeating the Labour incumbent, Fiona Jones, overturning a majority of 3,000 and creating a majority of just over 4,000. In the Commons, he initially served as a back-bencher on the Defence Select Committee before becoming Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Shadow Secretary of State for Defence. Mercer backed Iain Duncan Smith over Kenneth Clarke in the 2001 Conservative leadership election. Subsequently, he was appointed to a newly created post of Shadow Minister for Homeland Security in June 2003 after Duncan Smith became Conservative leader.

In 2004 he introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill in response to the publicity surrounding the case of Tony Martin that proposed to give householders greater powers when protecting their property from burglary.

Mercer increased his majority in Newark to 6,464 at the 2005 general election.

===Parliament from 2005===
During the Conservative leadership contest which followed the 2005 election, Mercer publicly backed David Davis over David Cameron, Kenneth Clarke, and Liam Fox.

Since 2005, he has repeatedly warned against the imposition of control orders as being &#x27;counter productive&#x27;. Citing his experience of internment in Northern Ireland, as a serving soldier, he highlighted the danger of alienating populations needed for intelligence gathering.

In March 2007, Mercer gave an interview to &quot;The Times&quot; in which he talked about &quot;idle and useless&quot; ethnic minority soldiers who had used racism as a &quot;cover&quot; and admitted that black soldiers in his regiment had been referred to as &quot;black bastard&quot; and &quot;nigger&quot;. Initially, the Conservative Party stated that the comments were a &quot;private matter&quot;, but soon David Cameron forced Mercer to resign as Shadow Minister for Homeland Security. Mercer publicly apologised and said &quot;I had the privilege to command soldiers from across the east Midlands, of whom many came from racial minorities. It was a matter of great pride to me that racial minorities prospered inside the unit. What I have said is clearly misjudged and I can only apologise if I have embarrassed in any way those fine men whom I commanded. I have no hesitation in resigning my front-bench appointment.&quot; A black former corporal who had served with Mercer came to his defence, and the chairwoman of his Conservative Association said she was &quot;extremely angry&quot; that Mercer&#x27;s comments had been taken out of context.

In December 2008, Mercer was appointed as Chairman of the House of Commons Sub-Committee on Counter-Terrorism, to further his work as a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee.

In March 2009 Mercer volunteered for three days at a charity named Save the Family, learning and helping displaced families as part of a programme devised by Iain Duncan Smith.

===Parliament from 2010===
At the 2010 general election, Mercer more than doubled his majority to 16,152, to make Newark one of the safest Conservative seats in the country. In August 2010, based on intelligence from serving army officers, he warned that dissident Irish terror groups could be planning to attack the party conferences, including the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham.

In May 2011, Mercer was appointed with Lord Ashcroft to review the future of the military bases in Cyprus.

In August 2011, Mercer with his knowledge of Northern Ireland, led the calls for considering the use of water cannon and other robust police tactics to deal with the rioters during the 2011 England riots. The next day David Cameron approved the use of water cannon after chairing a session of the Cabinet Office Briefing Room, Cobra.

In October 2011, Mercer supported a failed bid by the Everyday Champions Church to open a free school in his constituency. The bid was rejected because of concerns over the church&#x27;s explicitly creationist stance.

In November 2011, the press reported that Mercer had been taped making disparaging remarks about David Cameron, calling him &quot;despicable&quot; and describing him as an &quot;arse&quot; and &quot;the worst politician in British history since William Gladstone&quot;. The same articles claimed he had predicted that Cameron would be ousted by Conservative MPs in early 2012. Mercer later denied making the comments.

===Resignation===
Mercer resigned the Conservative Party whip on 31 May 2013 following an investigation by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; caught him on camera accepting payment for lobbying.

In June 2013, less than two weeks after Mercer had resigned the party whip, it was reported that in talking to an undercover reporter he had described a meeting with a young Israeli woman who said she was a soldier. He told the reporter he had thought to himself &quot;You don&#x27;t look like a soldier to me. You look like a bloody Jew&quot;. He then spoke to &quot;Jewish News&quot; and apologised unreservedly for any offence he had caused to the Jewish community by his &quot;stupid remark&quot;.

On 29 April 2014, after seeing a Commons Select Committee on Standards report into his conduct, due to be published on 1 May, calling for him to be barred from Parliament for six months, Mercer announced he would resign his seat. He was appointed to the Chiltern Hundreds the next day, making his resignation effective.

The Commons Standards Committee report on Mercer stated that its members were &quot;not aware of a case relating to a sitting MP which has involved such a sustained and pervasive breach of the house&#x27;s rules on registration, declaration and paid advocacy.&quot; It stated that Mercer &quot;had deliberately evaded the rules&quot;, including engaging in &quot;paid advocacy&quot; and failing to make &quot;any serious attempt to identify his ultimate clients&quot;. He had also failed to register monies received properly; to deposit the contract he signed to provide services; and to declare a relevant interest when tabling parliamentary questions, tabling an early-day motion, making approaches to other MPs, and when speaking at a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group. Mercer was also criticised for &quot;repeatedly denigrating fellow Members both individually and collectively&quot;.

The recommended period of suspension from the House of Commons was the second longest suspension since 1947. (Denis MacShane, later convicted of a criminal offence, was suspended for twelve months in 2012, and also resigned immediately as an MP.) One member voted to expel Mercer as an MP, and another wanted him suspended for eight months.

A by-election for the vacant Newark seat was held on 5 June 2014.
