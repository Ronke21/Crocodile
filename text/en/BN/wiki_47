<text>USS &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; (DDG-7), named for Admiral Henry Braid Wilson, was a &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided missile armed destroyer laid down by Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan on 28 February 1958, launched on 22 April 1959 sponsored by Mrs. Patrick J. Hurley, daughter of Admiral Wilson, and commissioned on 17 December 1960.

== History ==
One of a new class of destroyers built from the keel up to fire guided missiles, &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; was the first ship of her size to be side-launched and when launched was the largest warship ever constructed on the Great Lakes. Because of these unique circumstances, she was christened not with the traditional champagne but with a bottle filled with water from the Great Lakes, the Saint Lawrence River, and the Atlantic Ocean. Following shakedown in the Caribbean she arrived in early May 1961 at her new home port, Naval Base San Diego. During the months that followed &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; conducted tests and drills of her missile systems, fleet exercises, and type training.

The guided missile destroyer sailed 6 January 1962 for duty in the Western Pacific, the first ship in that region to be armed with Tartar missiles. Stopping at Pearl Harbor and Yokosuka, she carried out antisubmarine exercises until returning to the United States 19 July 1962.

Training off the California coast, punctuated with several missile firings, occupied &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; until 17 October 1963, when she sailed with carrier USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; for duty with 7th Fleet in the Western Pacific. During the next 5 months she operated as part of America&#x27;s mobile peacekeeping fleet between Japan and the Philippines. After returning to San Diego 16 April 1964, she resumed ASW and fire support operations.

&quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; sailed on her third deployment to the Far East 4 June 1965. Arriving Subic Bay, Luzon, 21 June, she became flagship for Destroyer Squadron 21, then began rescue and air defense picket duty in the Gulf of Tonkin 31 July, along with shore bombardment support. As escort for , she departed Subic Bay 7 November and arrived San Diego the 24th.

After a year&#x27;s operation off the West Coast, &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; departed San Diego for the Far East 5 November 1966. She resume picket duty off Vietnam 23 December. During the first 3 months of 1967 she cruised the South China Sea and Gulf of Tonkin, performing search and rescue missions and pounding enemy coastal positions in support of ground operations. She returned to San Diego early in May.

&quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; served as plane guard for carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Sea Dragon operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out naval gunfire support missions during the Vietnam War. In April 1975, she participated in Operation Eagle Pull (the evacuation of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, during its capture by the Khmer Rouge) and in May 1975 she participated in Operation Frequent Wind (the evacuation of South Vietnam during its capture by the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong) where part of her duties was to protect the ships loading evacuees by drawing fire from the shore batteries. During the same month she was one of the primaries in the operation to recapture the hijacked merchant ship in Cambodian waters.

On 10 August 1976 &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; departed home port for a Western Pacific deployment, returning home 21 March 1977. On 8 August 1979 she departed for another Westpac cruise and returned home on 14 February 1980. On 27 February 1981 &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; departed for another Westpac, returning on 21 September 1981. On 16 Mar 1984 &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; departed for a Westpac deployment and returned home 2 October 1984. On 15 September 1986 she departed for a Westpac and Indian Ocean deployment, returning home 14 March 1987. On 2 December 1988 &quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; departed on her final deployment going to the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. She returned 1 June 1989.

=== Fate ===
&quot;Henry B. Wilson&quot; was decommissioned on 2 October 1989, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 January 1990 and sold for scrap on 15 April 1994. The scrap contract was terminated on 23 March 1999 and the ship was resold on 6 April 2002. She was re-acquired and sunk as a target ship 15 August 2003.

<text>In number theory, Khinchin&#x27;s constant is a mathematical constant related to the simple continued fraction expansions of many real numbers. In particular Aleksandr Yakovlevich Khinchin proved that for almost all real numbers &quot;x&quot;, the coefficients &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; of the continued fraction expansion of &quot;x&quot; have a finite geometric mean that is independent of the value of &quot;x.&quot; It is known as Khinchin&#x27;s constant and denoted by &quot;K0.&quot;

That is, for

:formula_1

it is almost always true that

:formula_2
The decimal value of Khinchin&#x27;s constant is given by:
:formula_3 

Although almost all numbers satisfy this property, it has not been proven for &quot;any&quot; real number &quot;not&quot; specifically constructed for the purpose. The following numbers whose continued fraction expansions apparently do have this property (based on empirical data) are:

* π
* Roots of equations with a degree &gt; 2, &quot;e.g.&quot; cubic roots and quartic roots
* Natural logarithms, &quot;e.g.&quot; ln(2) and ln(3)
* The Euler-Mascheroni constant γ
* Apéry&#x27;s constant ζ(3)
* The Feigenbaum constants δ and α
* Khinchin&#x27;s constant

Among the numbers &quot;x&quot; whose continued fraction expansions are known &quot;not&quot; to have this property are:

* Rational numbers
* Roots of quadratic equations, &quot;e.g.&quot; the square roots of integers and the golden ratio (however, the geometric mean of all coefficients for square roots of nonsquare integers from 2 to 24 is about 2.708, suggesting that quadratic roots collectively may give the Khinchin constant as a geometric mean);
* The base of the natural logarithm &quot;e&quot;.

Khinchin is sometimes spelled Khintchine (the French transliteration of Russian Хинчин) in older mathematical literature.

==Series expressions==
Khinchin&#x27;s constant can be given by the following infinite product:

:formula_4

This implies:

:formula_5

Khinchin&#x27;s constant may also be expressed as a rational zeta series in the form

:formula_6
or, by peeling off terms in the series, 
:formula_7

where &quot;N&quot; is an integer, held fixed, and ζ(&quot;s&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) is the complex Hurwitz zeta function. Both series are strongly convergent, as ζ(&quot;n&quot;) − 1 approaches zero quickly for large &quot;n&quot;. An expansion may also be given in terms of the dilogarithm:

:formula_8

==Integrals==
There exist a number of integrals related to Khinchin&#x27;s constant:

: formula_9

: formula_10

: formula_11

: formula_12

==Sketch of proof==
The proof presented here was arranged by Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski and is much simpler than Khinchin&#x27;s original proof which did not use ergodic theory.

Since the first coefficient &quot;a&quot;0 of the continued fraction of &quot;x&quot; plays no role in Khinchin&#x27;s theorem and since the rational numbers have Lebesgue measure zero, we are reduced to the study of irrational numbers in the unit interval, i.e., those in formula_13. These numbers are in bijection with infinite continued fractions of the form [0; &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ...], which we simply write [&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ...], where &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ... are positive integers. Define a transformation &quot;T&quot;:&quot;I&quot; → &quot;I&quot; by

:formula_14

The transformation &quot;T&quot; is called the Gauss–Kuzmin–Wirsing operator. For every Borel subset &quot;E&quot; of &quot;I&quot;, we also define the Gauss–Kuzmin measure of &quot;E&quot;

:formula_15

Then &quot;μ&quot; is a probability measure on the &quot;σ&quot;-algebra of Borel subsets of &quot;I&quot;. The measure &quot;μ&quot; is equivalent to the Lebesgue measure on &quot;I&quot;, but it has the additional property that the transformation &quot;T&quot; preserves the measure &quot;μ&quot;. Moreover, it can be proved that &quot;T&quot; is an ergodic transformation of the measurable space &quot;I&quot; endowed with the probability measure &quot;μ&quot; (this is the hard part of the proof). The ergodic theorem then says that for any &quot;μ&quot;-integrable function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;I&quot;, the average value of formula_16 is the same for almost all formula_17:

:formula_18

Applying this to the function defined by &quot;f&quot;([&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ...]) = ln(&quot;a&quot;1), we obtain that

:formula_19

for almost all [&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ...] in &quot;I&quot; as &quot;n&quot; → ∞.

Taking the exponential on both sides, we obtain to the left the geometric mean of the first &quot;n&quot; coefficients of the continued fraction, and to the right Khinchin&#x27;s constant.

==Generalizations==
The Khinchin constant can be viewed as the first in a series of the Hölder means of the terms of continued fractions. Given an arbitrary series {&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;}, the Hölder mean of order &quot;p&quot; of the series is given by

:formula_20
When the {&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;} are the terms of a continued fraction expansion, the constants are given by
:formula_21

This is obtained by taking the &quot;p&quot;-th mean in conjunction with the Gauss–Kuzmin distribution. This is finite when formula_22.

The arithmetic average diverges: formula_23, and so the coefficients grow arbitrarily large: formula_24.

The value for &quot;K&quot;0 is obtained in the limit of &quot;p&quot; → 0.

The harmonic mean (&quot;p&quot; = −1) is
:formula_25 .

==Open problems==

Many well known numbers, such as , the Euler–Mascheroni constant γ, and Khinchin&#x27;s constant itself, based on numerical evidence, are thought to be among the numbers for which the limit formula_26 converges to Khinchin&#x27;s constant. However, none of these limits have been rigorously established. In fact, it has not been proven for &quot;any&quot; real number, which was not specifically constructed for that exact purpose.

The algebraic properties of Khinchin&#x27;s constant itself, e. g. whether it is a rational, algebraic irrational, or transcendental number, are also not known.

<text>HMAS &quot;Barbette&quot; (P 97) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Barbette&quot; was built by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland, launched on 10 April 1968, and commissioned on 16 August 1968.

==Operational history==
&quot;Barbette&quot; paid off on 15 June 1984. She was transferred to the Indonesian Navy on 22 February 1985 and renamed KRI &quot;Siada&quot; (862). The patrol boat was listed in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; as still operational in 2011.

<doc id="435318" wikidata="Q3220111" url="?curid=435318" title="Secularism in France">
<text>(; &#x27;secularism&#x27;) is the constitutional principle of secularism in France. Article 1 of the French Constitution is commonly interpreted as the separation of civil society and religious society. It discourages religious involvement in government affairs, especially in the determination of state policies as well as the recognition of a state religion. It also forbids government involvement in religious affairs, and especially prohibits government influence in the determination of religion, such that it includes a right to the free exercise of religion. 

French secularism has a long history: Enlightenment thinkers emphasized reason and self direction. Revolutionaries in 1789 violently overthrew the &quot;Ancien Régime,&quot; which included the Catholic Church. Secularism was an important ideology during the Second Empire and Third Republic. For the last century, the French government policy has been based on the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which is however not applicable in Alsace and Moselle. While the term has been used from the end of the 19th century to denote the freedom of public institutions from the influence of the Catholic Church, the concept today covers other religious movements as well.

==Concept==
 relies on the division between private life, where adherents believe religion belongs, and the public sphere, in which each individual should appear as a simple citizen who is equal to all other citizens, not putting the emphasis on any ethnic, religious, or other particularities. According to this concept, the government must refrain from taking positions on religious doctrine and consider religious subjects only for their practical consequences on inhabitants&#x27; lives.

It is best described as a belief that government and political issues should be kept separate from religious organizations and religious issues (as long as the latter do not have notable social consequences). This is meant to both protect the government from any possible interference from religious organizations and to protect the religious organization from political quarrels and controversies.

Proponents argue that itself does not necessarily imply any hostility of the government with respect to any religion, asserting that French state secularism is actually based upon respect for freedom of thought and freedom of religion. Therefore, the absence of a state religion—and the subsequent separation of the state and church—is considered by proponents to be a prerequisite for such freedoms.

==History==

The French word comes from Latin , which is a loanword from the Greek (, &#x27;of the people&#x27;), itself from (, &#x27;people&#x27;). The French suffix is equivalent to the English .
Secularism is a concept rooted in the French Revolution, beginning to develop since the French Third Republic after the Republicans gained control of the state.

While the term was originally the French equivalent of the term &quot;laity&quot; (i.e., everyone who is not clergy), this meaning changed after the Revolution, and came to denote the keeping of religion separate from the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government. This includes prohibitions on having a state religion and on the government endorsing any religious position, be it a religion or atheism.

From the end of the 19th century, the word has been used in the context of a secularization process—among countries where the Catholic Church had retained its influence—to mean the freedom of public institutions (especially primary schools) from the influence of the Church. Today, the concept covers other religious movements as well. Secularism took form for the first time during the French Revolution: the abolition of the Ancien Régime in August 1789 was accompanied by the end of religious privileges and the affirmation of universal principles, including the freedom of opinion and equal rights expressed by the 1789 Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen. The texts of the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen were incorporated into the preamble to the Constitution of October 4, 1958. Among them is article 10 of the declaration &quot;No one should be worried about his opinions, even religious, provided that their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law.&quot;

Public education has been secular since the laws of March 28, 1882, and October 30, 1886, which established &quot;moral and civic instruction&quot; in place of teaching religious morals and secularism of personnel and programs, respectively.

In the 19th century, secularization laws gradually separated the state from historical ties with the Catholic Church and created new sociopolitical values constructed on the principles of republican universalism. This process, which took place in a larger movement linked to modernity, entrusted the French people with redefining the political and social foundations: the executive, legislative and judicial powers; the organization of the state, its components, its representations; the education system, the rites of civil life, and the development of law and morality; regardless of religious beliefs. The Third Republic notably recreated the organization of the school system, by establishing public, secular, and compulsory education (Jules Ferry laws). The Jules Ferry laws (1881–1882) are supplemented by the Goblet law (established in 1886) on the organization of primary education, article 17 of which provides that education in public schools is exclusively entrusted to secular staff. This process culminated in 1905 with the Law of Separation of Churches and State, which solidified secularization.

=== 1905 law and the Constitution of 1946–1958 ===
Although the term was current throughout the 19th century, France did not fully separate church and state until the passage of its 1905 law on the separation of the Churches and the State, prohibiting the state from recognizing or funding any religion.

However, the 1905 law did not use the word itself, and so the notion of as a legal principle is open to question, as it was never defined as such by the text of a law. It was not until the Constitution of 1946 from the French Fourth Republic that the word appeared explicitly as a constitutional principle entailing legal effect, but without being further specified. If built before 1905 religious buildings in France (mostly Catholic churches, Protestant chapels, and Jewish synagogues) became the property of the city councils. Those now have the duty to maintain the (often historical) buildings but cannot subsidize the religious organizations using them. In areas that were part of Germany at that time, and which did not return to France until 1918, some arrangements for the cooperation of church and state are still in effect today (see Alsace-Moselle).

=== Constitution of 1958–present ===
Secularism is a core concept in the French Constitution: Article 1 formally states that France is a secular republic ().

===Current status and debate===

The principle of in France is implemented through a number of policies, primarily based on the 1905 law. The French government is legally prohibited from recognizing any &quot;religion&quot; (except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law of Alsace-Moselle). Instead, it recognizes &quot;religious organizations&quot;, according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine:
* whether the sole purpose of the organization is to organize religious activities (so that, for instance, the pretense of being a religious organization is not used for tax evasion)
* whether the organization disrupts public order.

French political leaders, though not by any means prohibited from making religious remarks, mostly refrain from it. Religious considerations are generally considered incompatible with reasoned political debate. Political leaders are not allowed to practice any religion and are expected to differentiate whatever religious beliefs from their political arguments. Christine Boutin, who openly argued on religious grounds against a legal domestic partnership available regardless of the sex of the partners, quickly became the butt of late-night comedy jokes.

Many find that being discreet with one&#x27;s religion is a necessary part of being French, which has led to frequent divisions with some non-Christian immigrants, especially with part of France&#x27;s large Muslim population. As such, the debate has taken place over whether any religious apparel or displays by individuals (e.g., the Islamic hijab, Sikh turban, Christian crosses, and Jewish Stars of David and kippah) should be banned from public schools. Such a ban in France came into effect in 2004. In the spring of 2011, the official non-discrimination agency, la HALDE, reinforced in hospitals—as advocated by the Minister of the Interior, Claude Guéant—and in public service generally.

The strict separation of church and state which began with the 1905 law has evolved into what some religious leaders see as a &quot;form of political correctness that made bringing religion into public affairs a major taboo.&quot; Former President Nicolas Sarkozy initially criticized this approach as a &quot;negative &quot; and wanted to develop a &quot;positive &quot; that recognizes the contribution of faith to French culture, history, and society, allows for faith in the public discourse, and enables government subsidies for faith-based groups. Sarkozy saw France&#x27;s main religions as positive contributions to French society. He visited the pope in December 2007 and publicly acknowledged France&#x27;s Christian roots, while highlighting the importance of freedom of thought, arguing that faith should come back into the public sphere. On 12 September 2008, in line with Sarkozy&#x27;s views on the need for reform of , Pope Benedict XVI said that it was time to revisit the debate over the relationship between church and state, advocating a &quot;healthy&quot; form of . Meeting with Sarkozy, he stated:

In 2009, Sarkozy changed footing on the place of religion in French society, as he publicly declared the burqa as &quot;not welcome&quot; in France, and favoring legislation to outlaw it. In February 2010, two people in burqas managed to pass the security doors of a post office in their full veils, after which the two removed their head coverings, pulled out a gun, and held up the post office. Following March 2011, local elections strong disagreement appeared within the governing UMP over the appropriateness of holding a debate on as desired by the French President. On 30 March 2011, a letter appeared in signed by representatives of 6 religious bodies opposing the appropriateness of such a debate.

A law was passed on 2011 April 11 with strong support from political parties, as well as from Sarkozy, which made it illegal to hide the face in public spaces, affecting a few thousand women in France wearing the niqab and the burqa.

Scholar Olivier Roy has argued that the burkini bans (2016) and secularist policies of France provoked religious violence in France (though the main islamist attacks happened in 2015, which evidencies the lacks of Roy&#x27;s point of view), to which Gilles Kepel responded that Britain, which has no such policies, still suffered a greater number of attacks in 2017 than France.

Lebanese-born French author Amin Maalouf has criticized the characterization of France&#x27;s political structure as truly secular, remarking: &quot;I have never understand how a country that called herself secular could call some of her citizens &#x27;French Muslims&#x27;, and deprive them of some of their rights merely because they belonged to a religion other than her own.&quot;

== Influence on other countries ==
Other countries have followed in the French model, having forms of secularism—examples include Albania, Mexico, and Turkey.

=== Quebec (Canada) ===
Public discourse in Quebec, the only predominantly French-speaking province in Canada, has been greatly influenced by the secularism of France since the 1960s. Prior to this time, Quebec was seen as a very observant Catholic society, where Catholicism was a &quot;de facto&quot; state religion. Quebec then underwent a period of rapid secularization called the Quiet Revolution. Quebec politicians have tended to adopt a more French-style understanding of secularism rather than the rest of Canada which is similar to the United States. This came to the fore during the debate on what constitutes the &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; of religious minorities.

In September 2013, the government of Quebec proposed Bill 60, the &quot;Charter affirming the values of State secularism and religious neutrality and of equality between women and men, and providing a framework for accommodation requests.&quot; The bill would alter the provincial human rights law to prohibit public employees from wearing objects that overtly indicate a religious preference. The people who would be most impacted by such a law would be Muslim women wearing a hijab, Jewish men wearing a kippah, and Sikh men (or women) wearing a turban. Employees who do not comply with the law would be terminated from their employment. The party that had proposed the bill, the Parti Québécois, was defeated in the 2014 election by the Quebec Liberal Party (who gained a majority of seats), which opposed the bill. As a result, the bill is considered &#x27;dead&#x27;.

In 2019, Premier François Legault&#x27;s CAQ government passed Bill 21, a secularism law banning public officials in positions of coercive power from wearing or displaying any religious symbols. However, the display of religious symbols affixed in public institutions like hospitals will be left for each administration thereof to decide. To counter charges of hypocrisy, the crucifix in the Quebec National Assembly was also removed.

=== Mexico ===
French influenced the Constitution of Mexico despite the Catholic Church maintaining strong influence. In March 2010, the Chamber of Deputies introduced legislation to amend the Constitution to make the Mexican government formally —meaning &#x27;lay&#x27; or &#x27;secular&#x27;. Critics of the move say the &quot;context surrounding the amendment suggests that it might be a step backward for religious liberty and true separation of church and state&quot;.

Coming on the heels of the Church&#x27;s vocal objection to legalization of abortion as well as same-sex unions and adoptions in Mexico City, &quot;together with some statements of its supporters, suggests that it might be an attempt to suppress the Catholic Church&#x27;s ability to engage in public policy debates.&quot; Mexico has had a history of religious suppression and persecution. Critics of the amendment reject the idea that &quot;Utilitarians, Nihilists, Capitalists, and Socialists can all bring their philosophy to bear on public life, but Catholics (or religious minorities) must check their religion at the door&quot; in a sort of &quot;second-class citizenship&quot; which they consider nothing more than religious discrimination.

=== Switzerland ===
=== Turkey ===
In Turkey, a strong stance of secularism () has held sway since Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s Turkish revolution in the early 20th century. On March 3, 1924, Turkey removed the caliphate system and gradually after that, all religious influence from the state. Sunni Islam, the majority religion, is now controlled by the Turkish government through the Department of Religious Affairs, and is state-funded while other religions or sects have independence on religious affairs. Islamic views that are deemed political are censored in accordance with the principle of secularism.

This system of Turkish permeates both the government and the religious sphere. The content of the weekly sermons in all state-funded mosques has to be approved by the state. Independent Sunni communities are also illegal. Minority religions, like Armenian or Greek Orthodoxy, are guaranteed by the constitution as &quot;individual&quot; faiths and are mostly tolerated, but this guarantee does not give any rights to any &quot;religious communities&quot; including Muslim ones. Turkey&#x27;s view is that the Treaty of Lausanne gives certain religious rights to Jews, Greeks, and Armenians but not, for example, to Syrian-Orthodox or Roman Catholics, because the latter ones did not play any political roles during the treaty. However, the Treaty of Lausanne does not specify any nationality or ethnicity and simply identifies non-Muslims in general.

In 2009, the desire to reestablish the Greek Orthodox seminary on Heybeli Island near Istanbul became a political issue in regard to Turkey&#x27;s accession to EU membership. The EU considers such prohibition to amount to suppression of religious freedom.

== Contrast with the United States ==

In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution contains a similar federal concept, although the term &quot;laicity&quot; is not used either in the Constitution or elsewhere and is sometimes used as a term to contrast European secularism with American secularism. That amendment includes clauses prohibiting both congressional governmental interference with the &quot;free exercise&quot; of religion and congressional laws regarding the establishment of religion. Originally this prevented the federal government from interfering with state-established religions. However, after the 14th amendment, these clauses have been held by the courts to apply to both the federal and state governments. Together, the &quot;free exercise clause&quot; and &quot;establishment clause&quot; are considered to accomplish a &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;

Nonetheless, separation is not extended to bar religious conduct in public places or by public servants. Public servants, up to and including the President of the United States, often make proclamations of religious faith. Sessions of both houses of the United States Congress and most state legislatures typically open with a prayer by a minister of some faith or other, and many if not most politicians and senior public servants in Washington, DC, attend the annual Roman Catholic Red Mass at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle regardless of their personal religious convictions. In contrast to France, the wearing of religious insignia in public schools is largely noncontroversial as a matter of law and culture in the US; the main cases where there have been controversies are when the practice in question is potentially dangerous (for instance, the wearing of the Sikh &quot;kirpan&quot; knife in public places) and even then the issue is usually settled in favor of allowing the practice. In addition, the US government regards religious institutions as tax-exempt non-profit organizations, subject to limitations on their political involvement. In contrast to Europe, however, the government cannot display religious symbols (such as the cross) in public schools, courts, and other government offices, although some exceptions are made (e.g. recognition of a cultural group&#x27;s religious holiday). The United States Supreme Court has also banned any activity in public schools and other government-run areas that can be viewed as a government endorsement of religion.

The French philosopher and Universal Declaration of Human Rights co-drafter Jacques Maritain, a devout Catholic convert and a critic of French , noted the distinction between the models found in France and in mid-20th century United States.
He considered the US model of that time to be more amicable because it had both &quot;sharp distinction and actual cooperation&quot; between church and state (what he called &quot;a historical treasure&quot;) and admonished the United States, &quot;Please to God that you keep it carefully and do not let your concept of separation veer round to the European one.&quot;

<text>Fuller Theological Seminary is a non-denominational / multi-denominational Christian seminary in Pasadena, California, with regional campuses in the western United States. It is egalitarian in nature.

Fuller has a student body of approximately 2,300 students from 90 countries and 110 denominations. There are over 41,000 alumni. Fuller is broadly evangelical among faculty and student body. Some hold conservative evangelical views such as unlimited inerrancy while others hold liberal evangelical sentiments such as limited inerrancy which views the Bible as true on matters of salvation but contains error in its recording of history and science.

==History==
Fuller Theological Seminary was founded in 1947 by Charles E. Fuller, a radio evangelist known for his &quot;Old Fashioned Revival Hour&quot; show, and Harold Ockenga, the pastor of Park Street Church in Boston. The seminary&#x27;s founders sought to reform fundamentalism&#x27;s separatist and sometimes anti-intellectual stance during the 1920s–1940s. Fuller envisaged that the seminary would become &quot;a Caltech of the evangelical world.&quot; In the late 1940s, evangelical theologians from Fuller championed the Christian importance of social activism.

The earliest faculty held theologically and socially conservative views, though professors with liberal perspectives arrived in the 1960s and 1970s. There were tensions in the late 1950s and early 1960s as some faculty members became uncomfortable with staff and students who did not agree with Biblical inerrancy. This led to people associated with the seminary playing a role in the rise of neo-evangelicalism and progressive theology.

David Hubbard recruited Donald McGavran to be the first dean of the newly created school of world mission in 1965. McGavran was esteemed as perhaps the world&#x27;s most prominent and influential missiologist of the 20th century. McGavran recruited some of the greatest missiologist of the 20th century to serve as faculty of the school of world mission at Fuller Theological Seminary. This included Alan Tippett, Ralph Winter, C. Peter Wagner and many others. These faculty would shape world missions for the ensuing decades. Fuller&#x27;s School of World Mission became the largest missions training institution in the world. The school of world mission also has the largest amount of missions faculty of any institution in the world as well as graduating the most missions students of any seminary.

In 2022, it had 2,370 students enrolled.

===Presidents===
Fuller has had six presidents over its over 70-year history. The founding president, Harold Ockenga, remained in Boston and served as president &quot;in absentia&quot; from 1947 to 1954. He described his role to Charles Fuller as recruiting faculty and setting the curriculum, which did not require his active presence in Pasadena. His successor and protege Edward John Carnell, a Baptist theologian and apologist, took over the post in 1954 but resigned in 1959 under failing health. Ockenga resumed his &quot;in absentia&quot; leadership until 35-year-old David Allen Hubbard, a Baptist Old Testament scholar and member of Fuller&#x27;s third entering class, became Fuller&#x27;s third president in 1963. Hubbard served for 30 years and led the seminary through both substantial growth and significant controversy.

Hubbard was succeeded by Reformed philosopher and theologian Richard Mouw, who served as president of Fuller from 1993 to 2013. In 2006, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article labeled him as &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s leading evangelicals&quot;. In July 2013, Mark Labberton became the Clifford L. Penner Presidential Chair of Fuller. Labberton, a Presbyterian (USA) pastor, had previously served Fuller as director of the Lloyd John Ogilvie Institute of Preaching since 2009. He retains his position as Lloyd John Ogilvie Associate Professor of Preaching alongside the presidency. Mouw remained at Fuller as Professor of Faith and Public Life until 2020. In October 2021, Labberton announced his retirement.

David Goatley became the sixth president in January 2023. He is the first African American to occupy the role. David is a missions executive and former administrative executive at Duke University.

==Academics==
Fuller Theological Seminary is organized into the School of Mission and Theology (SMT) and the School of Psychology &amp; Marriage and Family Therapy (SOPMFT). The seminary emphasizes integration between the schools and many students take courses in both. The seminary offers eight masters degrees, seven doctoral degrees, and two certificate programs. Four of the masters degrees are available fully online, and several are available in Korean or Spanish.

Fuller is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Additionally, the Clinical Psy.D. and Clinical Ph.D. programs of the SOPMFT are accredited by the American Psychological Association. Fuller&#x27;s student body of 2,897 includes students from 90 countries and 110 denominational backgrounds.

==Campuses==
Fuller closed Fuller Northwest (Seattle), Fuller Bay Area (Menlo Park), and Fuller Orange County (Irvine). It also reduced degree programs offered in Fuller Colorado (Colorado Springs) and Fuller Arizona (Phoenix). These closures and reductions took place before the 2019–20 academic year.

In May 2009, Fuller opened its David Allan Hubbard Library that incorporated the former McAlister Library building at its main campus in Pasadena, California for a total of .

In 2018, Fuller briefly planned to sell its main campus in Pasadena and move to Pomona. In October 2019 the board of directors voted to cancel the move and remain in Pasadena, citing dramatically escalated costs of construction in Southern California and differences with the City of Pasadena, which affected the sale and sale price of the seminary&#x27;s Pasadena campus.

Fuller currently has campuses in Pasadena, California, Phoenix, Arizona, and Houston, Texas. The Phoenix and Houston campuses are called Fuller Arizona and Fuller Texas, respectively.

== Social issues ==
While Fuller has established policies, the seminary is open to difference in opinion among students and faculty. The seminary&#x27;s former president, Mark Labberton, marched in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in 2013. Others have expressed support in the Fuller forum for the Black Lives Matter movement as raising awareness for civil rights. In 2015, some faculty at the seminary called on Christians to openly discuss, with respect, issues related to race, gender, sexual orientation, refugees, and immigrants.

The student club OneTable is the first LGBTQ group organized within an evangelical seminary. In 2021, three LGBTQ former Fuller students joined the class-action lawsuit &quot;Elizabeth Hunter et al. vs. U.S. Department of Education,&quot; arguing that religious exemptions that allow religious institutions of higher education to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity violate the Constitution. According to Fuller&#x27;s Community Standards, the seminary does not discriminate on the basis of gender identity and &quot;Fuller Theological Seminary also does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. The seminary does lawfully discriminate on the basis of sexual conduct that violates its biblically based &quot;Community Standard Statement on Sexual Standards&quot; ... The seminary believes premarital, extramarital, and homosexual forms of explicit sexual conduct to be inconsistent with the teaching of Scripture.&quot;

== Awards and prizes ==
Fuller annually awards the David Allan Hubbard Achievement Award to a graduating student from each of Seminary&#x27;s three schools, in recognition of outstanding work completed while at Fuller. The award was instituted in honor of David Allan Hubbard, an Old Testament scholar, and the third President of Fuller Theological Seminary. Each recipient is chosen by the faculty of their respective school.

<text>The Barcoo River in western Queensland, Australia rises on the northern slopes of the Warrego Range, flows in a south-westerly direction and unites with the Thomson River to form Cooper Creek. The first European to see the river was Thomas Mitchell in 1846, who named it Victoria River, believing it to be the same river as that named Victoria River by J. C. Wickham in 1839. It was renamed by Edmund Kennedy after a name supplied by local Aborigines.

The waters of the river flow towards Lake Eyre in central Australia while those of rivers further east join the Murray-Darling basin and reach the sea in South Australia. The river forms a boundary between outback Australia and the &quot;Far Outback&quot;; legend has it that west of the Barcoo there is very little in the way of civilisation.

Tributaries include the Alice River Towns situated on the banks of the Barcoo River include Blackall, Isisford, Tambo and Retreat. The southern boundary of Welford National Park is marked by the Barcoo River and Isisford Weir has been constructed on the Barcoo.

==Barcoo grunter==
The Barcoo grunter, also known as jade perch (&quot;scortum barcoo&quot;), is a native Australian freshwater fish found in the eastern Northern Territory rivers of Limmen, Roper, Macarthur; the Barkley Basin, and between the Gilbert River in Northern Queensland and the Lake Eyre drainage of central Australia. Barcoo Grunter is an excellent food fish, and is often farmed in intensive grow-out ponds or tanks in aquaculture.

==Disease==
The river, or at least the district, also gives its name to several diseases, once widespread in outback Australia but now largely unknown. One is &quot;Barcoo rot&quot;, a skin disease, perhaps similar to &quot;desert sore&quot;, characterised by crusted impetiginous skin sores and occurring in association with heat, dirt, minor traumas and a diet chronically deficient in fresh fruit and vegetables. A second is &quot;Barcoo fever&quot; in which the sufferer experiences fever, nausea and vomiting which was exacerbated by the sight or smell of food, and constipation. This disease, once common in the outback, has also vanished. It may have been due to drinking water contaminated by cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) toxins. Provision of more reliable food supplies and safer sources of water in the &quot;far Barcoo&quot; may explain why these diseases have now all but disappeared.

The name also appears in the phrase &quot;the Barcoo salute&quot; – brushing the ever-present bush flies from the face with either hand.

==Literary references==


The Barcoo is mentioned in some poems of Banjo Paterson. 
Examples are in the second stanza of &quot;Saltbush Bill&quot; and the first stanza of &quot;A Bush Christening&quot;.

The Barcoo is also referenced in Slim Dusty&#x27;s song, &quot;Mad Jack&#x27;s Cockatoo&quot;, in the second line of the first verse.

<text>Universal City is a neighborhood within the San Fernando Valley of the City of Los Angeles which includes portions of unincorporated area of Los Angeles County, California, United States. Approximately , within and immediately outside the area is the property of Universal Pictures (NBCUniversal&#x27;s film studio), one of the five major film studios in the United States: about 70 percent of the studio&#x27;s property is inside this unincorporated area, while the remaining 30 percent is within the Los Angeles city limits. Universal City is nearly surrounded by Los Angeles, with the area&#x27;s northeastern corner touching the city of Burbank.

Located within the area of Universal City is the film studio complex Universal Studios Lot and the theme park Universal Studios Hollywood, as well as the Universal CityWalk shopping and entertainment center. Within the Los Angeles city limits lies 10 Universal City Plaza, a 36-floor office building for Universal and NBC; the Sheraton Universal; and the Universal Hilton. The Metro B Line underground station of the same name is located opposite the 10 Universal Plaza.

A Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department (LASD) station is located at Universal CityWalk, and the community also houses the only government-funded fire station in the United States located on private property. The Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACFD) Station 51 (formerly Station 60 until the mid 1990s) is of special significance to Universal, as &quot;Station 51&quot; was the fictional setting of the Universal and Jack Webb television series &quot;Emergency!&quot; The current Station 51 was not used for external shots, or used as a model for the interior shots seen on the show (LACFD Station 127 in Carson was used).

Universal City&#x27;s ZIP code is 91608, and the community is inside area code 818.

==History==

Carl Laemmle officially opened the Second Universal City (Lankershim Boulevard) on March 15, 1915, on the Taylor Ranch property. At the launch event, in what is now the North Hollywood area, a crowd of men and women eagerly awaited the display of the film stages, daredevil stunt pilots and silent film idols, as well as the movie cameras Laemmle had brought along. &quot;See how slapstick comedies are made. See your favorite screen stars do their work. See how we make the people laugh or cry or sit on the edge of their chairs the world over!&quot; stated a poster touting Universal&#x27;s opening. &quot;C&#x27;mon out! Aw, c&#x27;mon!&quot;

Laemmle, a German immigrant, was Universal Pictures&#x27; founder who opened his first nickelodeon in Chicago in 1906. He moved to New York City, where he soon joined half a dozen small motion picture companies to create the movie company he called Universal Pictures.

In 1912, Laemmle briefly operated three small studios - Bison, Nestor, and Oak Crest Ranch. After a court battle with New York Motion Picture Company, control of the Bison lot was returned to the New York Motion Picture Company. The court allowed Carl Laemmle to retain use of the name &quot;Bison&quot; as &quot;Bison 101&quot; for his westerns, which were filmed on the Oak Crest property in the San Fernando Valley. The Oak Crest Ranch is where Laemmle filmed the western &quot;At Old Fort Dearborn&quot;. The Providencia Land and Water company, called &quot;Oak Crest Ranch&quot; in the trade papers, became the first Universal City location.

In 1913, Laemmle consolidated the Nestor studio (Hollywood) and Oak Crest ranch (Providencia) property. His first Universal City was too small, so he ordered a search for a new and larger property in the valley, a location with more space. Laemmle leased Providencia ranchland in the San Fernando Valley in 1912. If it was a city, it was a haphazard one: with the help of nearly 300 movie hands and actors, Laemmle erected makeshift buildings, set up cameras and began churning out hundreds of one- and two-reel silent westerns.

Other studio chiefs called the place &quot;Laemmle&#x27;s Folly&quot;, mocking that the property was so far out of town and that Laemmle could film scenery for free anywhere he wanted. Laemmle worried that he had made a huge mistake, though Universal was a success because the public could observe movies being made.

In the meantime, Laemmle added a zoo to the Oak Crest Ranch, which was open to visitors to generate free advertising by word of mouth. The Rotarians of Los Angeles were one of the groups permitted to visit the Oak Crest - Universal City.

The Oak Crest ranch being too small for his larger Universal City, Laemmle bought the Lankershim Land and Water property, the Taylor Ranch for $165,000, calling it his &quot;New Universal City&quot;.

In 1914, operations at The Oak Ranch (Providencia Ranch) were moved to the Taylor (Lankershim) ranch. The Universal (Oak Crest) ranch zoo was moved to the permanent Universal City Zoo location on the Back Ranch of the Lankershim property where it persisted until the 1930s. The new Universal City was opened for Universal staff in 1914.

Laemmle went on an eight-day whistle-stop tour from Chicago to Los Angeles the week before Universal City&#x27;s grand public opening. His promoters even sold the grand (and technically impossible) lie that Laemmle had persuaded the Secretary of the Navy to send a battleship up the Los Angeles River to fire a salvo on opening day. Easterners, they hoped, would believe anything they heard about California.

After World War I, Laemmle brought even more kin over from war-torn Europe, increasing the payroll to 70. His cheerful nepotism was immortalized in humorist Ogden Nash&#x27;s couplet: &quot;Uncle Carl Laemmle has a very large faemmle.&quot; Carl Laemmle was responsible for creating the &quot;star system&quot; rather than just using anonymous actors in films.

Laemmle was forced to end studio tours in the 1920s, when talkies came along and &quot;quiet on the set&quot; became an absolute. He sold his sprawling entertainment empire in 1936. Before his death in 1939, at age 72, he helped bring more than 200 German-Jewish refugees to Los Angeles.

A nephew, Max, founded the local Laemmle Theatres chain.

Universal City did not welcome tourists again until July 15, 1964, with the opening of the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park and its included Studio Tour. The next few decades saw the arrival of hotels, an amphitheater, and Universal CityWalk (a faux city street and popular destination for tourists and locals).

===Universal Ranch 1912===
On April 30, 1912, Carl Laemmle merged the Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP) with five smaller companies to form the Universal Film Manufacturing Company. After visiting his newly acquired west coast operations of Nestor Studios and Nestor Ranch, he renamed the studio &quot;Universal Studios&quot; and the leased Oak Crest Ranch became the first &quot;Universal City&quot; in the San Fernando Valley. The first Universal/Nestor Ranch (Providencia Land and Water Development Company property Oak Crest Ranch) is presently the site of Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills). In 1915, Universal moved its operations at the Hollywood/Nestor studio and Universal/Nestor Ranch to its new Lankershim Blvd. location before the official opening of Universal City (Lankershim Blvd). In 1916, the first Universal Oak Ranch became known as the Lasky Ranch. The Hollywood studio was then leased to Christie Comedies.

===Universal City – Oak Crest Ranch (1912–1914)===
In 1912, Carl Laemmle toured his Pacific Coast operations. He renamed the Nestor Studio &quot;Universal Studios&quot; and renamed the Providencia Ranch &quot;Universal City.&quot; Carl Laemmle thought the Providencia Ranch area was too small for his idea of &quot;Universal City.&quot; He ordered the purchase of Lankershim land Water Company property. Universal City moved to a new location, the Taylor Ranch.

===Lankershim Land and Water Company===
They purchased lots 276, 277, 278; also a small portion of Lot 279, marked &quot;Mary L. Carhart&quot; (left side of the Lankershim bridge). Only of the northern part of lot 278 became the official studios front lot in 1915. The zoo and second open-air stage were constructed on the northern sections of lot 277 and 278. The mountain portions above were not incorporated into studio use until MCA/Universal&#x27;s master plan to level the hills and create the Universal Studio Tour Center and City Walk.

===Universal City Ranch (Forest Lawn) moves===
Between 1914 and 1915 &quot;Universal City&quot; assets were moved to the Lankershim location.

===Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) history before 1917===

The Providencia Land and Water Development Company property was used as a location for some early films, most significantly the battle scenes in the silent classic about the American Civil War, &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915).

===Fires===

More than a half-dozen major fires have impacted the Universal Studios property (and, accordingly, Universal City) during its history.

==Climate==
==Government and infrastructure==

Fire protection in Universal City is provided by the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACFD). The LACFD operates Station #51 at 3900 Lankershim Boulevard as a part of Battalion 1.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department (LASD) operates the West Hollywood Station in West Hollywood, serving Universal City. In addition, the department operates the substation at Universal CityWalk in Universal City. Prior to the summer of 1991, the West Hollywood Station handled all calls for police service from Universal City. In the summer of 1991, the LASD established the substation in a trailer in the parking lot of the studio tour and remained in the area until two years later, when the substation was moved into a permanent location in the CityWalk theme mall when it opened. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) also shares jurisdiction with the LASD in providing protection to Universal City, operating the North Hollywood Community Police Station in North Hollywood, whose responsibilities include Universal City.

<text>HMAS &quot;Barricade&quot; (P 98) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Barricade&quot; was built by Evans Deakin and Company at Brisbane, Queensland, launched on 29 June 1968, and commissioned on 26 October 1968.

==Operational history==
&quot;Barricade&quot; was transferred to the Indonesian Navy on 22 April 1982 and renamed KRI &quot;Sigalu&quot;.

<text>2 mm scale, often 2 mm [[finescale]] is a specification used for railway modelling, largely for modelling British railway prototypes. It uses a scale of 2 mm on the model to 1 foot on the prototype, which scales out to 1:152.
The track gauge used to represent prototype standard gauge (4 feet inches) is . Track and wheels are closer to dead scale replicas than commercial British N.

==Standard==
The 2 mm standards were proposed by Mr. H H Groves in the early 1960s and revised to their current specification in November 1963 by Geoffrey Jones. It is similar in size to the slightly larger British N scale at 1:148, and the slightly smaller European/American N scale at 1:160; though it predates both.

Since 2 mm scale is very close to the 1:148 British N scale, a hybrid specification can be modelled by re-wheeling proprietary British N-scale models to the 9.42 mm track gauge. This hybrid specification results in a track gauge equivalent to , slightly narrower than the prototype 4 feet inches. There is an advantage however in the narrower gauge as this allows more room for the outside motion of outside cylindered steam locomotives, which must be overscale in order to function correctly. This approach is often recommended for beginners. However, 2 mm-scale and hybrid-scale models do not usually sit well together due to the larger size of the latter.

=== Supplementary Standards ===
Like Protofour, 2 mm standards have been extended to several other prototypes of both wider and narrower gauge with the same tolerances such as Brunel&#x27;s gauge, Japan Rail&#x27;s narrow gauge and so on.

==== FiNescale Standard ====

The FiNescale standard in use for European prototypes is identical to 2mmFS, with the exception of a to-scale rail gauge of .

=== Appreciation===
One major effect of the standard is to improve the appearance of the track as opposed to N scale, where it is overly tall. Linking carriages with three link chains has been successfully achieved in using the standard.

== Support ==
No ready-to-run models are available in 2 mm scale, and although there is some availability of kits and components, some model-making skill is normally required.

There is an active association, &quot;The 2mm Scale Association&quot;, for modellers in this scale, who supply components, tools and jigs, publish a bi-monthly magazine, organise local groups, and promote modelling in the scale.

==Exhibition layouts==
* An early example of a 2 mm layout was &quot;Rydes Vale&quot; which was created in the 1960s by H. H. Grove and his son.
* The development of the Kineton exhibition layout by the Leamington &amp; Warwick Model Railway Society was feature in series in the British Railway Modelling magazine running from February 2016.

<text>The Stanford University School of Medicine is the medical school of Stanford University and is located in Stanford, California, United States. It traces its roots to the Medical Department of the University of the Pacific, founded in San Francisco in 1858. This medical institution, then called Cooper Medical College, was acquired by Stanford in 1908. The medical school moved to the Stanford campus near Palo Alto, California, in 1959.

The School of Medicine, along with Stanford Health Care and Lucile Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital, is part of Stanford Medicine.

==History==
In 1855, Illinois physician Elias Samuel Cooper moved to San Francisco in the wake of the California Gold Rush. In cooperation with the University of the Pacific (also known as California Wesleyan College), Cooper established the Medical Department of the University of the Pacific, the first medical school on the West Coast, in 1858, on Mission Street near 3rd Street in San Francisco. However, in 1862 Cooper died, and without his leadership, the Medical Department of the University of the Pacific became moribund.

In 1870, Cooper&#x27;s nephew, Levi Cooper Lane, reactivated and reorganized the University of the Pacific&#x27;s medical department, and, in 1882, Lane donated a new building at the intersection of Webster and Sacramento Streets and established the department as a separate school, the Cooper Medical College. Lane built a hospital and a nursing school and made provision for the creation of Lane Medical Library.

In 1908, Cooper Medical College was deeded to Stanford University as a gift. It became Stanford&#x27;s medical institution, initially called the Stanford Medical Department and later the Stanford University School of Medicine. In the 1950s, the Stanford Board of Trustees decided to move the school to the Stanford main campus near Palo Alto. The move was completed in 1959. The San Francisco medical campus became Presbyterian Hospital and later California Pacific Medical Center.

In the 1980s, the Medical Center launched a major expansion program. A new hospital was added in 1989 with 20 new operating rooms, state of the art intensive care and inpatient units, and other technological additions. The Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine opened in May 1989 as an interdisciplinary center focusing on the molecular and genetic basis of disease. The Lucile Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital was completed in 1991, adding even more diversity to Stanford Medicine.

In the early years of the 21st century, the School of Medicine underwent rapid construction to further expand teaching and clinical opportunities. The Li Ka Shing Center for Learning and Knowledge opened in 2010; it serves as the gateway to the School of Medicine as well as providing a new model of medical education by combining biomedical research with clinical education and information technology. The Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Research Building also opened in 2010; it is the largest stem cell and regenerative medicine facility in North America. The Stem Cell Research Building is the first of the planned Stanford Institutes of Medicine. In addition to research facilities, it houses offices for faculty from the Stanford Cancer Center and &quot;hotel space&quot; offices for visiting researchers.

==Academic programs and students==
The School of Medicine has reversed the traditional teaching method of classroom time being reserved for lectures and problem-solving exercises being completed outside of school as homework; with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, school leaders are heading up a collaboration on the use of the &quot;flipped classroom&quot; approach to content delivery.

The School of Medicine also has a long history of educating physician assistants (PAs). Stanford University partnered with Foothill College in 1971 to form the Primary Care Associate Program (PCAP) which has graduated more than 1,500 PAs. The last PCAP class graduated in 2018. Today, the Stanford School of Medicine offers a Master of Science in PA Studies program that seeks to train highly qualified clinical PAs who can practice in any area of medicine and also be leaders in community health, research, and medical education. The program offers a novel approach to curriculum delivery and expanded clinical opportunities as well as interprofessional education, with PA students taking courses side by side with MD students. The program is 30 months in length, accepts 27 students each year, has an acceptance rate of less than 2%.

==Rankings and admissions==

In the 2021 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings, Stanford was ranked fourth in the nation among medical schools for research. Admission to the MD program at Stanford is highly competitive: in 2019, 6,894 people applied, 422 were interviewed, and 175 accepted for 90 spots.

Stanford is one of several schools in the United States to use the multiple mini-interview system, developed at McMaster University Medical School in Canada, to evaluate candidates.

Along with the School of Humanities and Science, the Stanford School of Medicine also runs the Biosciences PhD Program, which was ranked first in 2019 among graduate programs in the biological sciences by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In its graduate school specialties, according to &quot;U.S. News&quot; for 2019, Stanford is #1 in genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics, #1 in neuroscience and neurobiology, #1 in cell biology, #3 in biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology, and #4 in ecology and evolutionary biology.

<doc id="435331" wikidata="Q1197987" url="?curid=435331" title="Lysenkoism">
<text>Lysenkoism (, ; , ) was a political campaign led by the Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko against genetics and science-based agriculture in the mid-20th century, rejecting natural selection in favour of a form of Lamarckism, as well as expanding upon the techniques of vernalization and grafting.

More than 3,000 mainstream biologists were dismissed or imprisoned, and numerous scientists were executed in the Soviet campaign to suppress scientific opponents. The president of the Soviet Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, who had been Lysenko&#x27;s mentor, but later denounced him, was sent to prison and died there, while Soviet genetics research was effectively destroyed. Research and teaching in the fields of neurophysiology, cell biology, and many other biological disciplines were harmed or banned.

The government of the Soviet Union (USSR) supported the campaign, and Joseph Stalin personally edited a speech by Lysenko in a way that reflected his support for what would come to be known as Lysenkoism, despite his skepticism toward Lysenko&#x27;s assertion that all science is class-orientated in nature. Lysenko served as the director of the USSR&#x27;s Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Other countries of the Eastern Bloc including the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, the Republic of Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic accepted Lysenkoism as the official &quot;new biology&quot;, to varying degrees, as did the People&#x27;s Republic of China for some years.

==Context==


Mendelian genetics, the science of heredity, developed into an experimentally based field of biology at the start of the 20th century through the work of August Weismann, Thomas Hunt Morgan, and others, building on the rediscovered work of Gregor Mendel. They showed that the characteristics of an organism are carried by inherited genes, which were located on chromosomes in each cell&#x27;s nucleus. Genes can be affected by random changes (mutations), and can be shuffled and recombined during sexual reproduction, but are otherwise passed on unchanged from parent to offspring. Beneficial changes can propagate through a population by natural selection or, in agriculture, by plant breeding.

Some Marxists, however, perceived a fissure between Marxism and Darwinism. Specifically, the issue is that while the &quot;struggle for survival&quot; in Marxism applies to a social class as a whole (the class struggle), the struggle for survival in Darwinism is decided by individual random mutations. This was deemed a liberal doctrine, against the Marxist framework of &quot;immutable laws of history&quot; and the spirit of collectivism. In contrast, Lamarckism proposed that an organism can somehow pass on characteristics that it has acquired during its lifetime to its offspring, implying that changing the body can affect the genetic material in the germ line. To these Marxists, a &quot;neo-Lamarckism&quot; was deemed more compatible with Marxism.

Marxism–Leninism, which became the official ideology in Stalin&#x27;s USSR, incorporated Darwinian evolution as a foundational doctrine, providing a scientific basis for its state atheism. Initially, the Lamarckian principle of inheritance of acquired traits was considered a legitimate part of evolutionary theory, and Darwin himself supported it. Although the Mendelian view had largely replaced Lamarckism in western biology by 1925, it persisted in Soviet doctrine. Besides the fervent &quot;old style&quot; Darwinism of Marx and Engels which included elements of Lamarckism, two fallacious experimental results supported it in the USSR. First, Ivan Pavlov, who discovered conditioned reflex, announced in 1923 that it can be inherited in mice; and his subsequent withdrawal of this claim was ignored by Soviet ideologists. Second, Ivan Michurin interpreted his work on plant breeding as proof of the inheritance of acquired traits. Michurin advocated directed plant breeding by environmental control: &quot;We cannot wait for favors from nature: we must wrest them from her&quot;.

Kliment Timiryazev, a popularizer of science in Russia, had sympathies with communism, and allied with the new Soviet republic. This made his views more orthodox and widely known. When gene theory rose in early 1900s, some gene theorists promoted saltative mutationism as an alternative to gradualist Darwinism, and Timiriazev vigorously argued against it. Timiryazev&#x27;s views influenced many, including Michurin.

Soviet agriculture around 1930 was in a crisis due to Stalin&#x27;s forced collectivisation of farms and extermination of kulak farmers. The resulting Soviet famine of 1932–1933 provoked the government to search for a technical solution which would maintain their central political control.

==In the Soviet Union==

===Lysenko&#x27;s claims===

In 1928, rejecting natural selection and Mendelian genetics, Trofim Lysenko claimed to have developed agricultural techniques which could radically increase crop yields. These included vernalization, species transformation (one species turning into another), inheritance of acquired characteristics, and vegetative hybridization (see below). He claimed in particular that vernalization, exposing wheat seeds to humidity and low temperature, could greatly increase crop yield. He claimed further that he could transform one species, &quot;Triticum durum&quot; (durum spring wheat), into &quot;Triticum vulgare&quot; (common autumn wheat), through 2 to 4 years of autumn planting. This species transition he claimed to occur without an intermediate form. However, this was already known to be impossible since &quot;T. durum&quot; is a tetraploid with 28 chromosomes (4 sets of 7), while &quot;T. vulgare&quot; is hexaploid with 42 chromosomes (6 sets). This objection did not faze Lysenko, as he claimed that the chromosome number changed as well.

Lysenko claimed that the concept of a gene was a &quot;bourgeois invention&quot;, and he denied the presence of any &quot;immortal substance of heredity&quot; or &quot;clearly defined species&quot;, which he claimed belong to Platonic metaphysics rather than strictly materialist Marxist science. Instead, he proposed a &quot;Marxist genetics&quot; postulating an unlimited possibility of transformation of living organisms through environmental changes in the spirit of Marxian dialectical transformation, and in parallel to the Party&#x27;s program of creating the New Soviet Man and subduing nature for his benefit. Lysenko refused to admit random mutations, stating that &quot;science is the enemy of randomness&quot;.

Lysenko further claimed that Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics occurred in plants, as in the &quot;eyes&quot; of potato tubers, though the genetic differences in these plant parts were already known to be non-heritable somatic mutations. He also claimed that when a tree is grafted, the scion permanently changes the heritable characteristics of the stock. In modern biological theory, such a change is theoretically possible through horizontal gene transfer; however, there is no evidence that this actually occurs, and Lysenko rejected the mechanism of genes entirely.

===Rise===

Isaak Izrailevich Prezent, a biologist politically out of favour, brought Lysenko to public attention. He portrayed Lysenko as a genius who had developed a revolutionary technique which could lead to the triumph of Soviet agriculture, a thrilling possibility for a Soviet society suffering through Stalin&#x27;s famines. Lysenko became a favorite of the Soviet propaganda machine, which overstated his successes, trumpeted his faked experimental results, and omitted any mention of his failures. State media published enthusiastic articles such as &quot;Siberia is transformed into a land of orchards and gardens&quot; and &quot;Soviet people change nature&quot;, while anyone opposing Lysenko was presented as a defender of &quot;mysticism, obscurantism and backwardness.&quot; 

Lysenko&#x27;s political success was mostly due to his appeal to the Communist Party and Soviet ideology. His attack on the &quot;bourgeois pseudoscience&quot; of modern genetics and the proposal that plants can rapidly adjust to a changed environment suited the ideological battle in both agriculture and Soviet society. Following the disastrous collectivization efforts of the late 1920s, Lysenko&#x27;s new methods were seen by Soviet officials as paving the way to an &quot;agricultural revolution.&quot; Lysenko himself was from a peasant family and was an enthusiastic advocate of Leninism. The Party-controlled newspapers applauded Lysenko&#x27;s practical &quot;success&quot; and questioned the motives of his critics, ridiculing the timidity of academics who urged the patient, impartial observation required for science. Lysenko was admitted into the hierarchy of the Communist Party, and was put in charge of agricultural affairs. 

He used his position to denounce biologists as &quot;fly-lovers and people haters&quot;, and to decry traditional biologists as &quot;wreckers&quot; working to sabotage the Soviet economy. He denied the distinction between theoretical and applied biology, and rejected general methods such as control groups and statistics:

Lysenko presented himself as a follower of Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin, a well-known and well-liked Soviet horticulturist, but unlike Michurin, Lysenko insisted on using only non-genetic techniques such as hybridization and grafting.

Support from Joseph Stalin increased Lysenko&#x27;s popularity. In 1935, Lysenko compared his opponents in biology to the peasants who still resisted the Soviet government&#x27;s collectivization strategy, saying that by opponents of his theories were opponents of Marxism. Stalin was in the audience for this speech, and was the first to stand and applaud, calling out &quot;Bravo, Comrade Lysenko. Bravo.&quot; Stalin personally made encouraging edits to a speech by Lysenko, despite the dictator&#x27;s skepticism toward Lysenko&#x27;s assertion that all science is class-orientated. The official support emboldened Lysenko and gave him and Prezent free rein to slander any geneticists who still spoke out against him. After Lysenko became head of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences, classical genetics began to be called &quot;fascist science&quot; and many of Lysenkoism&#x27;s opponents, such as his former mentor Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov, were imprisoned or executed, although not on Lysenko&#x27;s personal orders.

During 1947 October, Lysenko and Stalin exchanged multiple letters. Lysenko promised Stalin to breed branching wheat into a yield of 15,000 kg/ha. At that time, the most productive wheat breed under exceptionally favorable conditions could achieve 2,000 kg/ha.Mendelism-Morganism, Weissmanist neo-Darwinism ... are not developed in Western capitalist countries for the purposes of agriculture, but rather serve reactionary purposes of eugenics, racism, etc. There is no relationship between agricultural practices and the theory of bourgeois genetics.

Lysenko&#x27;s letter to Stalin, October 27, 1947. 

=== Peak ===
From July 31 to August 7, 1948, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences (VASKhNIL) held a week-long session, organized by Lysenko and approved by Stalin. At the end of it, Lysenkoism was declared as &quot;the only correct theory.&quot; As Lysenko performatively spoke at the end, &quot;the Central Committee of the Communist Party has examined my report and approved it&quot;. Attendants recognized this as the birth of a new orthodoxy. Of the 8 scientists who advocated genetics during the session, 3 immediately announced repentance.

Soviet scientists were required to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko, and criticism was denounced as &quot;bourgeois&quot; or &quot;fascist&quot;. The Ministry of Higher Education commanded all biological institutes to immediately follow the Lysenko orthodoxy:The Central University Administration and the Administration of Cadres are directed to review within two months all departments of biological faculties to free them from all opposed to Michurinist biology and to strengthen them by appointing Michurinists to them.

Point 6 of the &quot;Order No. 1208&quot; (August 23, 1948) (trans. p. 125 )For several months, similar central directives dismissed scientists, withdrew textbooks, and required the removal of any references to heredity in higher education. There was also an order to destroy all stocks of &quot;Drosophila&quot; (the model organism for genetics studies). (p. 125 ) Leading geneticists were being monitored by secret agents from the State Security Service. (p. 129 )

The same wave of propaganda supported a number of other pseudo-scientific &quot;new Marxist sciences&quot; in the Soviet academy, in fields such as linguistics and art. Pravda reported the invention of a perpetual motion engine, confirming Engels&#x27; claim that energy dissipated in one place must concentrate somewhere else. Lysenko&#x27;s journal &quot;Agrobiology&quot; published reports of wheat turning into rye, cabbages into rutabaga, etc.

In 1948, the film &quot;Michurin&quot; portrayed Michurin as an ideal Soviet scientist, bringing the propaganda to the masses. Published songbooks included songs praising Lysenko, &quot;He walks the Michurin path/With firm tread;/He protects us from being duped/by Mendelist-Morganists.&quot; (p. 132 )

In Lysenko and his followers&#x27; political claim, the &quot;Weismannist-Mendelist-Morganist&quot; theory was reactionary and idealistic, a tool of the bourgeois, while the &quot;Michurinist&quot; theory was progressive and materialistic. The victory of Michurinism was framed as a victory of socialism over capitalism. Some even traced Hitler&#x27;s racial policies to the genetic theory. (pp. 119-121 ) 

A prominent promoter of Lysenkoism was the biologist Olga Lepeshinskaya, who attempted to demonstrate abiogenesis of cells and tissues from &quot;vital substance&quot;. She delivered a speech in 1950 in which she equated all of the &quot;bourgeois&quot; heresies:

Perhaps the only opponents of Lysenkoism during Stalin&#x27;s lifetime to escape liquidation were from the small community of Soviet nuclear physicists: according to Tony Judt, &quot;it is significant that Stalin left his nuclear physicists alone and never presumed to second guess &quot;their&quot; calculations. Stalin may well have been mad but he was not stupid.&quot;

===Effects on scientists===
In 1948, genetics was officially declared &quot;a bourgeois pseudoscience&quot;. Over 3,000 biologists were imprisoned, fired or executed for attempting to oppose Lysenkoism, and genetics research was effectively destroyed until the death of Stalin in 1953. Soviet crop yields declined.

From 1934 to 1940, under Lysenko&#x27;s admonitions and with Stalin&#x27;s approval, many geneticists were executed (including Izrail Agol, Solomon Levit, Grigorii Levitskii, Georgii Karpechenko and Georgii Nadson) or sent to labor camps. The famous Soviet geneticist and president of the Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, was arrested in 1940 and died in prison in 1943. In 1936, the American geneticist Hermann Joseph Muller, who had moved to the Leningrad Institute of Genetics with his &quot;Drosophila&quot; fruit flies, was criticized as bourgeois, capitalist, imperialist, and a promoter of fascism, and he returned to America via Republican Spain. Iosif Rapoport, who worked on mutagens, refused to publicly repudiate chromosome theory of heredity, and suffered several years as a geological lab assistant. Dmitry Sabinin&#x27;s book on plant physiology was abruptly withdrawn from publication in 1948. He died by suicide in 1951.

Those who supported Lysenkoism were favored. Oparin vigorously defended Lysenkoism and was politically favored, although he may have been genuine in his belief, as he continued to defend it even in 1955, after its fall.

Inspired by the success of Lysenkoism and the 1948 VASKhNIL session, other fields of Soviet science experienced brief revolutions, albeit with less success: against &quot;Pavlovians&quot; in medicine, against &quot;reactionary Einsteinism&quot; in physics and quantum mechanics, and against Pauling resonance theory in chemistry.

In addition to the biological sciences, Lysenkoism had an impact on geological sciences, especially paleontology and biostratigraphy in the USSR.

===Fall===

At the end of 1952, the situation started to change, and newspapers published articles criticizing Lysenkoism. However, the return to regular genetics slowed down in Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s time, when Lysenko showed him the supposed successes of an experimental agricultural complex. It was once again forbidden to criticize Lysenkoism, though it was now possible to express different views, and the geneticists imprisoned under Stalin were released or rehabilitated posthumously. The ban was finally lifted in the mid-1960s.

Lysenkoism was never dominant in the West, and during the 1960s, it increasingly was seen as pseudoscience. Soviet scientists noticed the great advance in molecular biology, such as the characterization of DNA, and even hold-out Lysenkoists were starting to accept DNA as the material basis for heredity (though they still rejected gene theory).

===Reappearance===

In the 21st century, Lysenkoism is again being discussed in Russia, including in respectable newspapers like &quot;Kultura&quot; and by biologists. The geneticist Lev Zhivotovsky has made the unsupported claim that Lysenko helped found modern developmental biology. Discoveries in the field of epigenetics are sometimes raised as alleged late confirmation of Lysenko&#x27;s theories, but in spite of the apparent high-level similarity (heritable traits passed on without DNA alteration), Lysenko believed that environment-induced changes are the primary mechanism of heritability. Heritable epigenetic effects have been found, but are minor and unstable compared to genetic inheritance.

== Scientific content ==
Lysenkoism, as a scientific theory, aimed to replace Darwinian evolution and genetic theory with a new theory, one that can explain and justify the phenomena claimed by Lysenko to exist, such as vernalization, species transformation, inheritance of acquired characteristics, vegetative hybridization, etc.

Heredity was reformulated as &quot;the property of the living body to demand certain environmental conditions and to react in a certain way to them&quot;. Michurin attempted to explain Lamarckian heredity by theorizing that some sort of &quot;heredity&quot; is present all throughout an organism, which reacts to environmental influence. This is incompatible with the Weismann barrier, which leads Lysenkoists to denounce Weismann. Instead, they proposed a &quot;physiological&quot; theory, that the heredity diffused throughout the body is somehow collected in the germ cells, which are &quot;built from molecules, granules, of various organs and parts of the organism&quot;, i.e. the pangenesis theory. When two germ cells form a zygote, the &quot;weak&quot; one is assimilated by the stronger one, like food digestion.

This theory also explains vegetative hybridization, as the heredity in the scion may diffuse into the stock, resulting in a change in the stock&#x27;s offspring. The vegetative hybridization theory was further tested on animals by injecting blood, for example, by injecting blood from colored chicken into a white chicken. It was claimed that the white chicken&#x27;s offspring showed partly and fully colors. However, such claims were rejected by Western scientists. The plant hybridization experiments did not replicate, and the chicken experiment did not control for recessive alleles.

Lysenko also proposed a form of Lamarckian heterochrony. An individual plant develops in stages, depending on its environment. A change in environment can speed up or slow down the stages, and result in downstream effects that are then inherited. This theory justified Lysenkoist plant-breeding practices.

As Darwin proposed the pangenesis theory, this partly redeems Darwin for Lysenko, though the historical correctness of Darwin was demoted in comparison with Lamarck&#x27;s.

==In other countries==
Other countries of the Eastern Bloc accepted Lysenkoism as the official &quot;new biology&quot;, to varying degrees.

In Communist Poland, Lysenkoism was aggressively pushed by state propaganda. State newspapers attacked &quot;damage caused by bourgeois Mendelism-Morganism&quot; and &quot;imperialist genetics&quot;, comparing it to &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. For example, &quot;Trybuna Ludu&quot; published an article titled &quot;French scientists recognize superiority of Soviet science&quot; by Pierre Daix, a French communist and chief editor of &quot;Les Lettres Françaises&quot;, basically repeating Soviet propaganda claims; this was intended to create an impression that Lysenkoism was accepted by the whole progressive world. While some academics accepted Lysenkoism for political reasons, the Polish scientific community largely opposed it. A notable opponent was Wacław Gajewski: in retaliation, he was denied contact with students, though he allowed to continue his scientific work at the Warsaw botanical garden. Lysenkoism was rapidly rejected starting from 1956, and in 1958 Gajewski founded the first department of genetics, at the University of Warsaw.

Communist Czechoslovakia adopted Lysenkoism in 1949. The prominent geneticist Jaroslav Kříženecký (1896–1964) criticized Lysenkoism in his lectures, and was dismissed from the Agricultural University in 1949 for &quot;serving the established capitalistic system, considering himself superior to the working class, and being hostile to the democratic order of the people&quot;; he was imprisoned in 1958.

In East Germany, although Lysenkoism was taught at some universities, it had very little impact on science due to the actions of a few scientists, such as the geneticist Hans Stubbe, and scientific contact with West Berlin research institutions. Nonetheless, Lysenkoist theories were found in schoolbooks as late as the dismissal of Nikita Khrushchev in 1964.

Lysenkoism dominated Chinese science from 1949 until 1956, during which open discussion of alternative theories like classical Mendelian genetics was forbidden. Only in 1956 during a genetics symposium opponents of Lysenkoism were permitted to freely criticize it and argue for Mendelian genetics. In the proceedings from the symposium, Tan Jiazhen is quoted as saying &quot;Since [the] USSR started to criticize Lysenko, we have dared to criticize him too&quot;. For a while, both schools were permitted to coexist, although the influence of the Lysenkoists remained large for several years, contributing to the Great Famine through loss of yields.

Almost alone among Western scientists, John Desmond Bernal, Professor of Physics at Birkbeck College, London, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and a communist, made an aggressive public defence of Lysenko.

<doc id="435332" wikidata="Q2583326" url="?curid=435332" title="USS Canberra (CA-70)">
<text>USS &quot;Canberra&quot; (CA-70/CAG-2) was a and later a guided missile cruiser of the United States Navy (USN). Originally to be named USS &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;, the ship was renamed before launch to honor the Australian cruiser sunk during the Battle of Savo Island. &quot;Canberra&quot; was the first USN warship named after a foreign capital city, and one of the few named after a foreign warship not captured in battle with a USN ship.

The ship entered service in 1943 and served in the Pacific theater of World War II until she was torpedoed during the Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa and forced to return to the United States for repairs. Placed in reserve after the war, &quot;Canberra&quot; was selected for conversion into the second guided-missile carrying warship in the USN fleet. Following the conversion, she was host to the ceremony for selecting the Unknown Soldier representing World War II in 1958, undertook an eight-month round-the-world cruise in 1960, participated in the Cuban Missile Crisis naval blockade in 1962, and was deployed to the Vietnam War on five occasions between 1965 and 1969.

==Construction==
The heavy cruiser was laid down as USS &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; by the Bethlehem Steel Company Fore River Shipyard at Quincy in Massachusetts on 3 September 1941. During construction, in recognition of the valor displayed by the Australian cruiser during the Battle of Savo Island, United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wished to commemorate the Australian ship&#x27;s loss by naming a US ship in her honor: &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; was selected and renamed USS &quot;Canberra&quot;. The ship was launched on 19 April 1943 by Alice, Lady Dixon, the wife of Sir Owen Dixon, Australia&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, and is one of two United States warships (the other being the Littoral Class Combat Ship USS Canberra (LCS-30)) to be named after a foreign capital city. &quot;Canberra&quot; was commissioned into the USN on 14 October 1943, Captain Alex Rieman Early, USN commanding. The Australian Government returned this tribute by naming a new destroyer, , in honor of the US stand during the Battle of Bataan.

==Operational history==

===World War II===
She left Boston in January 1944, San Diego, and joined Task Force 58 in mid-February. In late February, the ship provided bombardment support during the Battle of Eniwetok. During March and April, the cruiser formed part of the carrier task group, supporting the aircraft carrier during air raids on Palaus, Yap, Ulithi and Woleai during 31 March and 1 April. On 13 April, &quot;Canberra&quot; escorted &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s aircraft when they provided support to amphibious landings at Hollandia and Wakde.

From 29 April to 1 May, the cruiser was attached to the group for air attacks on Truk, during the operation, &quot;Canberra&quot; detached to shell a Japanese airbase at Satawan. The cruiser was involved in raids on Marcus and Wake Islands during May, and in June joined operations to capture the Mariana and Palau Islands. As part of this campaign, &quot;Canberra&quot; participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and shelled Japanese positions in the Bonin Islands. During August and September, the ship performed raids on the Palaus and the Philippines providing gunfire support during the Morotai landings.
At the start of October, &quot;Canberra&quot; joined Task Force 38, tasked with performing air raids on Okinawa and Taiwan, in preparation for the landings at Leyte. On 13 October, an air-dropped torpedo from a Japanese aircraft hit the cruiser below her armour belt. The explosion killed 23 personnel and exposed the engineering spaces to the ocean, stalling the ship. took &quot;Canberra&quot; under tow for a rendezvous with the tug , which took over the tow after putting a salvage crew aboard. During the tow, the salvage officer from &quot;Munsee&quot; was killed while diving in the cruiser&#x27;s flooded engine room to make temporary repairs. A week into the tow towards Ulithi, &quot;Munsee&quot; was joined by the War Shipping Administration leased tug &quot;Watch Hill&quot;. It took another week for the two tugboats to bring &quot;Canberra&quot; to the repair ship . After temporary repairs at Manus, &quot;Canberra&quot; sailed under her own power to Boston Navy Yard. The cruiser was docked for repairs, which lasted from February to October 1945. The cruiser was deployed to the west coast of the United States in late 1945.

&quot;Canberra&quot; received seven battle stars for her wartime service.

===&quot;Boston&quot; class conversion===
&quot;Canberra&quot; was decommissioned on 7 March 1947 and berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, located in Bremerton, Washington. &quot;Canberra&quot; and sister ship were marked for conversion into guided missile cruisers, &quot;Canberra&quot; was redesignated with the hull number CAG-2 and on 4 January 1952, she was towed to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden, New Jersey, for conversion into a .
During the conversion, &quot;Canberra&quot;″s aft 8-inch and 5-inch gun turrets were replaced with two twin RIM-2 Terrier missile launchers. Her aft superstructure was rebuilt, and the two funnels were redesigned as a single unit. The upgrade of the ship concluded in June 1956, making &quot;Canberra&quot; the second guided-missile ship in the USN fleet. If the conversion proved successful, the plan was to replace the rest of the ship&#x27;s gun armament with missiles at a later date. However, by 1964, the rapid advancement of missile technology made the Terrier system obsolete, and full conversion was not pursued.

===Post-conversion career===
&quot;Canberra&quot; was recommissioned on 15 June 1956, and homeported at Norfolk, Virginia. From June until March 1957, the cruiser operated from Norfolk and through the Caribbean. On 14 March, &quot;Canberra&quot; delivered President Dwight D. Eisenhower to Bermuda for a conference with Harold Macmillan, the British Prime Minister. On 12 June, the cruiser served as review ship for the International Naval Review at Hampton Roads. After a training cruise during July and August, &quot;Canberra&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean for NATO Operation Strikeback.
The cruiser returned to American waters on 9 March 1958. In mid-April 1958, &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Canberra&quot; hosted a change of command ceremonies in which Rear Admiral Charles B. Martell relieved Rear Admiral Charles L. Melson as Commander Cruiser Division Four at Norfolk Naval Base.

On 26 May, the ceremony for the selection of the Unknown Soldier representing World War II occurred aboard &quot;Canberra&quot;. From June to August, the cruiser sailed on another training cruise, before docking at Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul.

From 3 March until 24 October 1960, the cruiser made an 8-month round-the-world cruise to show the flag and demonstrate her missile capabilities to U.S. and Allied forces. During the voyage, she flew the flag of Rear Admiral J. McN. Taylor, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet Cruiser Force and Cruiser Division 6. During this deployment, the ship visited the site of her Australian cruiser namesake&#x27;s sinking, along with locations where the American cruiser had herself served during World War II.

In 1962, she sailed south from Norfolk to participate in the naval blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis. During the Vietnam War, &quot;Canberra&quot; was homeported at San Diego. She deployed to Vietnam five times from 1965 to 1969 where her 8-inch and 5-inch guns provided support for US troops. During the deployments in 1967 and 1968, &quot;Canberra&quot; operated north of the DMZ shelling bridges, transport routes and shore installations. On 2 March 1967, the cruiser was hit by two shells fired from ashore, which caused 5 injuries and minor structural damage. On 6 April 1967, a young seaman named Doug Hegdahl was accidentally blown overboard by one of the 5-inch guns; he was captured by a North Vietnamese gunboat and imprisoned in the infamous Hanoi Hilton. Hegdahl&#x27;s recollections of his time there would later serve as proof of torture committed by the North Vietnamese at POW camps. At the conclusion of her second tour of duty in April 1967, the cruiser visited Melbourne, and was in Australian waters in May for commemorations of the Battle of the Coral Sea.

During the 1968 Tet Offensive, &quot;Canberra&quot; went south to support the troops at Hue and fired 35,000 rounds in 31 days. On 1 May 1968, &quot;Canberra&quot; returned to her original hull number of CA-70; following the obsolescence of her missile armament, her 8-inch guns were reclassified as the cruiser&#x27;s main armament, although the Terrier launchers were retained until 1969. Her last Vietnam deployment ended in early January 1969.

==Decommissioning and fate==

USS &quot;Canberra&quot; was decommissioned on 2 February 1970 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July 1978. She was sold for scrap to National Metal on 15 July 1980, and removed from the Suisun Bay Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility on 1 August and broken up.

One of the ship&#x27;s propellers was placed on display at the Los Angeles Maritime Museum. The ship&#x27;s bell was kept in storage, and despite US law preventing the possession of naval artefacts by other nations, a campaign led to the bell being presented to Australian Prime Minister John Howard by US President George W. Bush on 10 September 2001, as commemoration for the 50 years of the ANZUS treaty. The bell was placed on display in the USA Gallery of the Australian National Maritime Museum.

<text>Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical elements and compounds necessary for plant growth and reproduction, plant metabolism and their external supply. In its absence the plant is unable to complete a normal life cycle, or that the element is part of some essential plant constituent or metabolite. This is in accordance with Justus von Liebig&#x27;s law of the minimum. The total essential plant nutrients include seventeen different elements: carbon, oxygen and hydrogen which are absorbed from the air, whereas other nutrients including nitrogen are typically obtained from the soil (exceptions include some parasitic or carnivorous plants).

Plants must obtain the following mineral nutrients from their growing medium:
* The macronutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), magnesium (Mg), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O)
* The micronutrients (or trace minerals): iron (Fe), boron (B), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni)

These elements stay beneath soil as salts, so plants absorb these elements as ions. The macronutrients are taken-up in larger quantities; hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon contribute to over 95% of a plant&#x27;s entire biomass on a dry matter weight basis. Micronutrients are present in plant tissue in quantities measured in parts per million, ranging from 0.1 to 200 ppm, or less than 0.02% dry weight.

Most soil conditions across the world can provide plants adapted to that climate and soil with sufficient nutrition for a complete life cycle, without the addition of nutrients as fertilizer. However, if the soil is cropped it is necessary to artificially modify soil fertility through the addition of fertilizer to promote vigorous growth and increase or sustain yield. This is done because, even with adequate water and light, nutrient deficiency can limit growth and crop yield.

==History==

Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are the basic nutrients plants receive from air and water. Justus von Liebig proved in 1840 that plants needed nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. Liebig&#x27;s law of the minimum states that a plant&#x27;s growth is limited by nutrient deficiency. Plant cultivation in media other than soil was used by Arnon and Stout in 1939 to show that molybdenum was essential to tomato growth.

==Processes==
Plants take up essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air through their leaves. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.

The root, especially the root hair, a unique cell, is the essential organ for the uptake of nutrients. The structure and architecture of the root can alter the rate of nutrient uptake. Nutrient ions are transported to the center of the root, the stele, in order for the nutrients to reach the conducting tissues, xylem and phloem. The Casparian strip, a cell wall outside the stele but in the root, prevents passive flow of water and nutrients, helping to regulate the uptake of nutrients and water. Xylem moves water and mineral ions in the plant and phloem accounts for organic molecule transportation. Water potential plays a key role in a plant&#x27;s nutrient uptake. If the water potential is more negative in the plant than the surrounding soils, the nutrients will move from the region of higher solute concentration—in the soil—to the area of lower solute concentration - in the plant.

There are three fundamental ways plants uptake nutrients through the root:
# Simple diffusion occurs when a nonpolar molecule, such as O2, CO2, and NH3 follows a concentration gradient, moving passively through the cell lipid bilayer membrane without the use of transport proteins.
# Facilitated diffusion is the rapid movement of solutes or ions following a concentration gradient, facilitated by transport proteins.
# Active transport is the uptake by cells of ions or molecules against a concentration gradient; this requires an energy source, usually ATP, to power molecular pumps that move the ions or molecules through the membrane.

Nutrients can be moved in plants to where they are most needed. For example, a plant will try to supply more nutrients to its younger leaves than to its older ones. When nutrients are mobile in the plant, symptoms of any deficiency become apparent first on the older leaves. However, not all nutrients are equally mobile. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are mobile nutrients while the others have varying degrees of mobility. When a less-mobile nutrient is deficient, the younger leaves suffer because the nutrient does not move up to them but stays in the older leaves. This phenomenon is helpful in determining which nutrients a plant may be lacking.

Many plants engage in symbiosis with microorganisms. Two important types of these relationship are
# with bacteria such as rhizobia, that carry out biological nitrogen fixation, in which atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is converted into ammonium (NH); and
# with mycorrhizal fungi, which through their association with the plant roots help to create a larger effective root surface area. Both of these mutualistic relationships enhance nutrient uptake.

The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere contains over 78 percent nitrogen. Plants called legumes, including the agricultural crops alfalfa and soybeans, widely grown by farmers, harbour nitrogen-fixing bacteria that can convert atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen the plant can use. Plants not classified as legumes such as wheat, corn and rice rely on nitrogen compounds present in the soil to support their growth. These can be supplied by mineralization of soil organic matter or added plant residues, nitrogen fixing bacteria, animal waste, through the breaking of triple bonded N2 molecules by lightning strikes or through the application of fertilizers.

==Functions of nutrients==
At least 17 elements are known to be essential nutrients for plants. In relatively large amounts, the soil supplies nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur; these are often called the macronutrients. In relatively small amounts, the soil supplies iron, manganese, boron, molybdenum, copper, zinc, chlorine, and cobalt, the so-called micronutrients. Nutrients must be available not only in sufficient amounts but also in appropriate ratios.

Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given clone. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element, and vice versa. An abundance of one nutrient may cause a deficiency of another nutrient. For example, K+ uptake can be influenced by the amount of NH available.

Nitrogen is plentiful in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and a number of commercially-important agricultural plants engage in nitrogen fixation (conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to a biologically useful form). However, plants mostly receive their nitrogen through the soil, where it is already converted in biological useful form. This is important because the nitrogen in the atmosphere is too large for the plant to consume, and takes a lot of energy to convert into smaller forms. These include soybeans, edible beans and peas as well as clovers and alfalfa used primarily for feeding livestock. Plants such as the commercially-important corn, wheat, oats, barley and rice require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow.

Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Green plants ordinarily obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Each of these nutrients is used for a different essential function.

=== Basic nutrients ===

The basic nutrients are derived from air and water.

====Carbon====

Carbon forms the backbone of most plant biomolecules, including proteins, starches and cellulose. Carbon is fixed through photosynthesis; this converts carbon dioxide from the air into carbohydrates which are used to store and transport energy within the plant.

====Hydrogen====

Hydrogen is necessary for building sugars and building the plant. It is obtained almost entirely from water. Hydrogen ions are imperative for a proton gradient to help drive the electron transport chain in photosynthesis and for respiration.

====Oxygen====

Oxygen is a component of many organic and inorganic molecules within the plant, and is acquired in many forms. These include: O2 and CO2 (mainly from the air via leaves) and H2O, NO, H2PO and SO (mainly from the soil water via roots). Plants produce oxygen gas (O2) along with glucose during photosynthesis but then require O2 to undergo aerobic cellular respiration and break down this glucose to produce ATP.

===Macronutrients (primary)===
====Nitrogen====
Nitrogen is a major constituent of several of the most important plant substances. For example, nitrogen compounds comprise 40% to 50% of the dry matter of protoplasm, and it is a constituent of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. It is also an essential constituent of chlorophyll. In many agricultural settings, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient for rapid growth.

====Phosphorus====
Like nitrogen, phosphorus is involved with many vital plant processes. Within a plant, it is present mainly as a structural component of the nucleic acids: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), as well as a constituent of fatty phospholipids, that are important in membrane development and function. It is present in both organic and inorganic forms, both of which are readily translocated within the plant. All energy transfers in the cell are critically dependent on phosphorus. As with all living things, phosphorus is part of the Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is of immediate use in all processes that require energy with the cells. Phosphorus can also be used to modify the activity of various enzymes by phosphorylation, and is used for cell signaling. Phosphorus is concentrated at the most actively growing points of a plant and stored within seeds in anticipation of their germination.

====Potassium====
Unlike other major elements, potassium does not enter into the composition of any of the important plant constituents involved in metabolism, but it does occur in all parts of plants in substantial amounts. It is essential for enzyme activity including enzymes involved in primary metabolism. It plays a role in turgor regulation, effecting the functioning of the stomata and cell volume growth.

It seems to be of particular importance in leaves and at growing points. Potassium is outstanding among the nutrient elements for its mobility and solubility within plant tissues.

Processes involving potassium include the formation of carbohydrates and proteins, the regulation of internal plant moisture, as a catalyst and condensing agent of complex substances, as an accelerator of enzyme action, and as contributor to photosynthesis, especially under low light intensity. Potassium regulates the opening and closing of the stomata by a potassium ion pump. Since stomata are important in water regulation, potassium regulates water loss from the leaves and increases drought tolerance. Potassium serves as an activator of enzymes used in photosynthesis and respiration. Potassium is used to build cellulose and aids in photosynthesis by the formation of a chlorophyll precursor. The potassium ion (K+) is highly mobile and can aid in balancing the anion (negative) charges within the plant. A relationship between potassium nutrition and cold resistance has been found in several tree species, including two species of spruce. Potassium helps in fruit coloration, shape and also increases its brix. Hence, quality fruits are produced in potassium-rich soils.

Research has linked K+ transport with auxin homeostasis, cell signaling, cell expansion, membrane trafficking and phloem transport.

===Macronutrients (secondary and tertiary)===

====Sulfur====
Sulfur is a structural component of some amino acids (including cysteine and methionine) and vitamins, and is essential for chloroplast growth and function; it is found in the iron-sulfur complexes of the electron transport chains in photosynthesis. It is needed for N2 fixation by legumes, and the conversion of nitrate into amino acids and then into protein.

====Calcium====
Calcium in plants occurs chiefly in the leaves, with lower concentrations in seeds, fruits, and roots. A major function is as a constituent of cell walls. When coupled with certain acidic compounds of the jelly-like pectins of the middle lamella, calcium forms an insoluble salt. It is also intimately involved in meristems, and is particularly important in root development, with roles in cell division, cell elongation, and the detoxification of hydrogen ions. Other functions attributed to calcium are: the neutralization of organic acids; inhibition of some potassium-activated ions; and a role in nitrogen absorption. A notable feature of calcium-deficient plants is a defective root system. Roots are usually affected before above-ground parts. Blossom end rot is also a result of inadequate calcium.

Calcium regulates transport of other nutrients into the plant and is also involved in the activation of certain plant enzymes. Calcium deficiency results in stunting. This nutrient is involved in photosynthesis and plant structure. It is needed as a balancing cation for anions in the vacuole and as an intracellular messenger in the cytosol.

====Magnesium====
The outstanding role of magnesium in plant nutrition is as a constituent of the chlorophyll molecule. As a carrier, it is also involved in numerous enzyme reactions as an effective activator, in which it is closely associated with energy-supplying phosphorus compounds.

=== Micro-nutrients ===

Plants are able sufficiently to accumulate most trace elements. Some plants are sensitive indicators of the chemical environment in which they grow (Dunn 1991), and some plants have barrier mechanisms that exclude or limit the uptake of a particular element or ion species, e.g., alder twigs commonly accumulate molybdenum but not arsenic, whereas the reverse is true of spruce bark (Dunn 1991). Otherwise, a plant can integrate the geochemical signature of the soil mass permeated by its root system together with the contained groundwaters. Sampling is facilitated by the tendency of many elements to accumulate in tissues at the plant&#x27;s extremities. Some micronutrients can be applied as seed coatings.

====Iron====
Iron is necessary for photosynthesis and is present as an enzyme cofactor in plants. Iron deficiency can result in interveinal chlorosis and necrosis.
Iron is not a structural part of chlorophyll but very much essential for its synthesis. Copper deficiency can be responsible for promoting an iron deficiency.
It helps in the electron transport of plant.

As with other biological processes, the main useful form of iron is that of iron(II) due to its higher solubility in neutral pH. However, plants are also capable of using iron(III) via citric acid, using the photo-reduction of ferric citrate. In the field, as with many other transitional metal elements, iron fertilizer is supplied as a chelate.

====Molybdenum====
Molybdenum is a cofactor to enzymes important in building amino acids and is involved in nitrogen metabolism. Molybdenum is part of the nitrate reductase enzyme (needed for the reduction of nitrate) and the nitrogenase enzyme (required for biological nitrogen fixation). Reduced productivity as a result of molybdenum deficiency is usually associated with the reduced activity of one or more of these enzymes.

====Boron====
Boron has many functions in a plant: it affects flowering and fruiting, pollen germination, cell division, and active salt absorption. The metabolism of amino acids and proteins, carbohydrates, calcium, and water are strongly affected by boron. Many of those listed functions may be embodied by its function in moving the highly polar sugars through cell membranes by reducing their polarity and hence the energy needed to pass the sugar. If sugar cannot pass to the fastest growing parts rapidly enough, those parts die.

====Copper====
Copper is important for photosynthesis. Symptoms for copper deficiency include chlorosis. It is involved in many enzyme processes; necessary for proper photosynthesis; involved in the manufacture of lignin (cell walls) and involved in grain production. It is difficult to find in some soil conditions.

====Manganese====
Manganese is necessary for photosynthesis, including the building of chloroplasts. Manganese deficiency may result in coloration abnormalities, such as discolored spots on the foliage.

====Sodium====
Sodium is involved in the regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate in CAM and C4 plants. Sodium can potentially replace potassium&#x27;s regulation of stomatal opening and closing.

Essentiality of sodium:
* Essential for C4 plants rather C3
* Substitution of K by Na: Plants can be classified into four groups:
# Group A—a high proportion of K can be replaced by Na and stimulate the growth, which cannot be achieved by the application of K
# Group B—specific growth responses to Na are observed but they are much less distinct
# Group C—Only minor substitution is possible and Na has no effect
# Group D—No substitution occurs
* Stimulate the growth—increase leaf area and stomata. Improves the water balance
* Na functions in metabolism
# C4 metabolism
# Impair the conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenol-pyruvate
# Reduce the photosystem II activity and ultrastructural changes in mesophyll chloroplast
* Replacing K functions
# Internal osmoticum
# Stomatal function
# Photosynthesis
# Counteraction in long distance transport
# Enzyme activation
* Improves the crop quality e.g. improves the taste of carrots by increasing sucrose

====Zinc====
Zinc is required in a large number of enzymes and plays an essential role in DNA transcription. A typical symptom of zinc deficiency is the stunted growth of leaves, commonly known as &quot;little leaf&quot; and is caused by the oxidative degradation of the growth hormone auxin.

====Nickel====
In vascular plants, nickel is absorbed by plants in the form of Ni2+ ion. Nickel is essential for activation of urease, an enzyme involved with nitrogen metabolism that is required to process urea. Without nickel, toxic levels of urea accumulate, leading to the formation of necrotic lesions. In non-vascular plants, nickel activates several enzymes involved in a variety of processes, and can substitute for zinc and iron as a cofactor in some enzymes.

====Chlorine====
Chlorine, as compounded chloride, is necessary for osmosis and ionic balance; it also plays a role in photosynthesis.

====Cobalt====
Cobalt has proven to be beneficial to at least some plants although it does not appear to be essential for most species. It has, however, been shown to be essential for nitrogen fixation by the nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with legumes and other plants.

====Silicon====
Silicon is not considered an essential element for plant growth and development. It is always found in abundance in the environment and hence if needed it is available. It is found in the structures of plants and improves the health of plants.

In plants, silicon has been shown in experiments to strengthen cell walls, improve plant strength, health, and productivity. There have been studies showing evidence of silicon improving drought and frost resistance, decreasing lodging potential and boosting the plant&#x27;s natural pest and disease fighting systems. Silicon has also been shown to improve plant vigor and physiology by improving root mass and density, and increasing above ground plant biomass and crop yields. Silicon is currently under consideration by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO) for elevation to the status of a &quot;plant beneficial substance&quot;.

====Vanadium====
Vanadium may be required by some plants, but at very low concentrations. It may also be substituting for molybdenum.

====Selenium====
Selenium is probably not essential for flowering plants, but it can be beneficial; it can stimulate plant growth, improve tolerance of oxidative stress, and increase resistance to pathogens and herbivory.

==Mobility==

===Mobile===
Nitrogen is transported via the xylem from the roots to the leaf canopy as nitrate ions, or in an organic form, such as amino acids or amides. Nitrogen can also be transported in the phloem sap as amides, amino acids and ureides; it is therefore mobile within the plant, and the older leaves exhibit chlorosis and necrosis earlier than the younger leaves. Because phosphorus is a mobile nutrient, older leaves will show the first signs of deficiency. Magnesium is very mobile in plants, and, like potassium, when deficient is translocated from older to younger tissues, so that signs of deficiency appear first on the oldest tissues and then spread progressively to younger tissues.

===Immobile===
Because calcium is phloem immobile, calcium deficiency can be seen in new growth. When developing tissues are forced to rely on the xylem, calcium is supplied by transpiration only.

Boron is not relocatable in the plant via the phloem. It must be supplied to the growing parts via the xylem. Foliar sprays affect only those parts sprayed, which may be insufficient for the fastest growing parts, and is very temporary.

In plants, sulfur cannot be mobilized from older leaves for new growth, so deficiency symptoms are seen in the youngest tissues first. Symptoms of deficiency include yellowing of leaves and stunted growth.

==Nutrient deficiency==

===Symptoms===
The effect of a nutrient deficiency can vary from a subtle depression of growth rate to obvious stunting, deformity, discoloration, distress, and even death. Visual symptoms distinctive enough to be useful in identifying a deficiency are rare. Most deficiencies are multiple and moderate. However, while a deficiency is seldom that of a single nutrient, nitrogen is commonly the nutrient in shortest supply.

Chlorosis of foliage is not always due to mineral nutrient deficiency. Solarization can produce superficially similar effects, though mineral deficiency tends to cause premature defoliation, whereas solarization does not, nor does solarization depress nitrogen concentration.

===Macronutrients===
Nitrogen deficiency most often results in stunted growth, slow growth, and chlorosis. Nitrogen deficient plants will also exhibit a purple appearance on the stems, petioles and underside of leaves from an accumulation of anthocyanin pigments.

Phosphorus deficiency can produce symptoms similar to those of nitrogen deficiency, characterized by an intense green coloration or reddening in leaves due to lack of chlorophyll. If the plant is experiencing high phosphorus deficiencies the leaves may become denatured and show signs of death. Occasionally the leaves may appear purple from an accumulation of anthocyanin. As noted by Russel: &quot;Phosphate deficiency differs from nitrogen deficiency in being extremely difficult to diagnose, and crops can be suffering from extreme starvation without there being any obvious signs that lack of phosphate is the cause&quot;. Russell&#x27;s observation applies to at least some coniferous seedlings, but Benzian found that although response to phosphorus in very acid forest tree nurseries in England was consistently high, no species (including Sitka spruce) showed any visible symptom of deficiency other than a slight lack of lustre. Phosphorus levels have to be exceedingly low before visible symptoms appear in such seedlings. In sand culture at 0 ppm phosphorus, white spruce seedlings were very small and tinted deep purple; at 0.62 ppm, only the smallest seedlings were deep purple; at 6.2 ppm, the seedlings were of good size and color.

The root system is less effective without a continuous supply of calcium to newly developing cells. Even short term disruptions in calcium supply can disrupt biological functions and root function. A common symptom of calcium deficiency in leaves is the curling of the leaf towards the veins or center of the leaf. Many times this can also have a blackened appearance. The tips of the leaves may appear burned and cracking may occur in some calcium deficient crops if they experience a sudden increase in humidity. Calcium deficiency may arise in tissues that are fed by the phloem, causing blossom end rot in watermelons, peppers and tomatoes, empty peanut pods and bitter pits in apples. In enclosed tissues, calcium deficiency can cause celery black heart and &quot;brown heart&quot; in greens like escarole.

Researchers found that partial deficiencies of K or P did not change the fatty acid composition of phosphatidyl choline in &quot;Brassica napus L.&quot; plants. Calcium deficiency did, on the other hand, lead to a marked decline of polyunsaturated compounds that would be expected to have negative impacts for integrity of the plant membrane, that could effect some properties like its permeability, and is needed for the ion uptake activity of the root membranes.

Potassium deficiency may cause necrosis or interveinal chlorosis. Deficiency may result in higher risk of pathogens, wilting, chlorosis, brown spotting, and higher chances of damage from frost and heat. When potassium is moderately deficient, the effects first appear in the older tissues, and from there progress towards the growing points. Acute deficiency severely affects growing points, and die-back commonly occurs. Symptoms of potassium deficiency in white spruce include: browning and death of needles (chlorosis); reduced growth in height and diameter; impaired retention of needles; and reduced needle length.

===Micronutrients===
Mo deficiency is usually found on older growth. Fe, Mn and Cu effect new growth, causing green or yellow veins, Zn ca effect old and new leaves, and B will be seem on terminal buds. A plant with zinc deficiency may have leaves on top of each other due to reduced internodal expansion.

Zinc is the most widely deficient micronutrient for industrial crop cultivation, followed by boron. Acidifying N fertilizers create micro-sites around the that keep micronutrient cations soluble for longer in alkaline soils, but high concentrations of P or C may negate these effects.

Boron deficiencies effecting seed yields and pollen fertility are common in laterite soils. Boron is essential for the proper forming and strengthening of cell walls. Lack of boron results in short thick cells producing stunted fruiting bodies and roots. Deficiency results in the death of the terminal growing points and stunted growth. Inadequate amounts of boron affect many agricultural crops, legume forage crops most strongly. Boron deficiencies can be detected by analysis of plant material to apply a correction before the obvious symptoms appear, after which it is too late to prevent crop loss. Strawberries deficient in boron will produce lumpy fruit; apricots will not blossom or, if they do, will not fruit or will drop their fruit depending on the level of boron deficit. Broadcast of boron supplements is effective and long term; a foliar spray is immediate but must be repeated.

==Toxicity==
Boron concentration in soil water solution higher than one ppm is toxic to most plants. Toxic concentrations within plants are 10 to 50 ppm for small grains and 200 ppm in boron-tolerant crops such as sugar beets, rutabaga, cucumbers, and conifers. Toxic soil conditions are generally limited to arid regions or can be caused by underground borax deposits in contact with water or volcanic gases dissolved in percolating water.

==Availability and uptake==

===Nitrogen fixation===
There is an abundant supply of nitrogen in the earth&#x27;s atmosphere—N2 gas comprises nearly 79% of air. However, N2 is unavailable for use by most organisms because there is a triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms in the molecule, making it almost inert. In order for nitrogen to be used for growth it must be &quot;fixed&quot; (combined) in the form of ammonium (NH) or nitrate (NO) ions. The weathering of rocks releases these ions so slowly that it has a negligible effect on the availability of fixed nitrogen. Therefore, nitrogen is often the limiting factor for growth and biomass production in all environments where there is a suitable climate and availability of water to support life.

Microorganisms have a central role in almost all aspects of nitrogen availability, and therefore for life support on earth. Some bacteria can convert N2 into ammonia by the process termed &quot;nitrogen fixation&quot;; these bacteria are either free-living or form symbiotic associations with plants or other organisms (e.g., termites, protozoa), while other bacteria bring about transformations of ammonia to nitrate, and of nitrate to N2 or other nitrogen gases. Many bacteria and fungi degrade organic matter, releasing fixed nitrogen for reuse by other organisms. All these processes contribute to the nitrogen cycle.

Nitrogen enters the plant largely through the roots. A &quot;pool&quot; of soluble nitrogen accumulates. Its composition within a species varies widely depending on several factors, including day length, time of day, night temperatures, nutrient deficiencies, and nutrient imbalance. Short day length promotes asparagine formation, whereas glutamine is produced under long day regimes. Darkness favors protein breakdown accompanied by high asparagine accumulation. Night temperature modifies the effects due to night length, and soluble nitrogen tends to accumulate owing to retarded synthesis and breakdown of proteins. Low night temperature conserves glutamine; high night temperature increases accumulation of asparagine because of breakdown. Deficiency of K accentuates differences between long- and short-day plants. The pool of soluble nitrogen is much smaller than in well-nourished plants when N and P are deficient since uptake of nitrate and further reduction and conversion of N to organic forms is restricted more than is protein synthesis. Deficiencies of Ca, K, and S affect the conversion of organic N to protein more than uptake and reduction. The size of the pool of soluble N is no guide &quot;per se&quot; to growth rate, but the size of the pool in relation to total N might be a useful ratio in this regard. Nitrogen availability in the rooting medium also affects the size and structure of tracheids formed in the long lateral roots of white spruce (Krasowski and Owens 1999).

===Root environment===
====Mycorrhiza====
Phosphorus is most commonly found in the soil in the form of polyprotic phosphoric acid (H3PO4), but is taken up most readily in the form of H2PO. Phosphorus is available to plants in limited quantities in most soils because it is released very slowly from insoluble phosphates and is rapidly fixed once again. Under most environmental conditions it is the element that limits growth because of this constriction and due to its high demand by plants and microorganisms. Plants can increase phosphorus uptake by a mutualism with mycorrhiza. On some soils, the phosphorus nutrition of some conifers, including the spruces, depends on the ability of mycorrhizae to take up, and make soil phosphorus available to the tree, hitherto unobtainable to the non-mycorrhizal root. Seedling white spruce, greenhouse-grown in sand testing negative for phosphorus, were very small and purple for many months until spontaneous mycorrhizal inoculation, the effect of which was manifested by a greening of foliage and the development of vigorous shoot growth.

====Root temperature====
When soil-potassium levels are high, plants take up more potassium than needed for healthy growth. The term &quot;luxury consumption&quot; has been applied to this. Potassium intake increases with root temperature and depresses calcium uptake. Calcium to boron ratio must be maintained in a narrow range for normal plant growth. Lack of boron causes failure of calcium metabolism which produces hollow heart in beets and peanuts.

===Nutrient interactions===
Calcium and magnesium inhibit the uptake of trace metals. Copper and zinc mutually reduce uptake of each other. Zinc also effects iron levels of plants. These interactions are dependent on species and growing conditions. For example, for clover, lettuce and red beet plants nearing toxic levels of zinc, copper and nickel, these three elements increased the toxicity of the others in a positive relationship. In barley positive interaction was observed between copper and zinc, while in French beans the positive interaction occurred between nickel and zinc. Other researchers have studied the synergistic and antagonistic effects of soil conditions on lead, zinc, cadmium and copper in radish plants to develop predictive indicators for uptake like soil pH.

Calcium absorption is increased by water-soluble phosphate fertilizers, and is used when potassium and potash fertilizers decrease the uptake of phosphorus, magnesium and calcium. For these reasons, imbalanced application of potassium fertilizers can markedly decrease crop yields.

===Solubility and soil pH===
Boron is available to plants over a range of pH, from 5.0 to 7.5. Boron is absorbed by plants in the form of the anion BO. It is available to plants in moderately soluble mineral forms of Ca, Mg and Na borates and the highly soluble form of organic compounds. It is mobile in the soil, hence, it is prone to leaching. Leaching removes substantial amounts of boron in sandy soil, but little in fine silt or clay soil. Boron&#x27;s fixation to those minerals at high pH can render boron unavailable, while low pH frees the fixed boron, leaving it prone to leaching in wet climates. It precipitates with other minerals in the form of borax in which form it was first used over 400 years ago as a soil supplement. Decomposition of organic material causes boron to be deposited in the topmost soil layer. When soil dries it can cause a precipitous drop in the availability of boron to plants as the plants cannot draw nutrients from that desiccated layer. Hence, boron deficiency diseases appear in dry weather.

Most of the nitrogen taken up by plants is from the soil in the forms of NO, although in acid environments such as boreal forests where nitrification is less likely to occur, ammonium NH is more likely to be the dominating source of nitrogen. Amino acids and proteins can only be built from NH, so NO must be reduced.

Fe and Mn become oxidized and are highly unavailable in acidic soils.

==Measurements==

Nutrient status (mineral nutrient and trace element composition, also called ionome and nutrient profile) of plants are commonly portrayed by tissue elementary analysis. Interpretation of the results of such studies, however, has been controversial. During recent decades the nearly two-century-old &quot;law of minimum&quot; or &quot;Liebig&#x27;s law&quot; (that states that plant growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource) has been replaced by several mathematical approaches that use different models in order to take the interactions between the individual nutrients into account.

Later developments in this field were based on the fact that the nutrient elements (and compounds) do not act independently from each other; Baxter, 2015, because there may be direct chemical interactions between them or they may influence each other&#x27;s uptake, translocation, and biological action via a number of mechanisms as exemplified for the case of ammonia.

==Plant nutrition in agricultural systems==

===Fertilizers===
Boron is highly soluble in the form of borax or boric acid and is too easily leached from soil making these forms unsuitable for use as a fertilizer. Calcium borate is less soluble and can be made from sodium tetraborate. Boron is often applied to fields as a contaminant in other soil amendments but is not generally adequate to make up the rate of loss by cropping. The rates of application of borate to produce an adequate alfalfa crop range from 15 pounds per acre for a sandy-silt, acidic soil of low organic matter, to 60 pounds per acre for a soil with high organic matter, high cation exchange capacity and high pH. Application rates should be limited to a few pounds per acre in a test plot to determine if boron is needed generally. Otherwise, testing for boron levels in plant material is required to determine remedies. Excess boron can be removed by irrigation and assisted by application of elemental sulfur to lower the pH and increase boron solubility. Foliar sprays are used on fruit crop trees in soils of high alkalinity.

Selenium is, however, an essential mineral element for animal (including human) nutrition and selenium deficiencies are known to occur when food or animal feed is grown on selenium-deficient soils. The use of inorganic selenium fertilizers can increase selenium concentrations in edible crops and animal diets thereby improving animal health.

It is useful to apply a high phosphorus content fertilizer, such as bone meal, to perennials to help with successful root formation.

===Hydroponics===
Hydroponics is a method for growing plants in a water-nutrient solution without using nutrient-rich soil or substrates. Researchers and home gardeners can grow their plants in a controlled environment. The most common artificial nutrient solution is the Hoagland solution, developed by D. R. Hoagland and W. C. Snyder in 1933. The solution (known as &quot;A-Z solution&quot;) consists of all the essential macro- and micronutrients in the correct proportions necessary for most plant growth. An aerator is used to prevent an anoxic event or hypoxia. Hypoxia can affect the nutrient uptake of a plant because, without oxygen present, respiration becomes inhibited within the root cells. The nutrient film technique is a hydroponic technique in which the roots are not fully submerged. Incomplete submergence allows for adequate aeration of the roots, while a &quot;film&quot; thin layer of nutrient-rich water is pumped through the system to provide nutrients and water to the plant.

<doc id="435337" wikidata="Q7198347" url="?curid=435337" title="Inuit music">
<text>Traditional Inuit music (sometimes Eskimo music, Inuit-Yupik music, Yupik music or Iñupiat music), the music of the Inuit, Yupik, and Iñupiat, has been based on drums used in dance music as far back as can be known, and a vocal style called &quot;katajjaq&quot; (Inuit throat singing) has become of interest in Canada and abroad.

Characteristics of Inuit music include recitative-like singing, complex rhythmic organization, a relatively small melodic range averaging about a sixth, prominence of major thirds and minor seconds melodically, and undulating melodic movement.

The Copper Inuit living around Coppermine River flowing north to Coronation Gulf have generally two categories of music. A song is called (also known as &quot;pisiit&quot; or &quot;piheq&quot;) if the performer also plays drums and &quot;aton&quot; if he only dances. Each &quot;pisik&quot; functions as a personal song of a drummer and is accompanied by dancing and singing. Each drummer has his own style and performs during gatherings. One drum is used in the performance of a &quot;pisik&quot; and often begins in a slow tempo, gradually building in intensity. The wooden frame drum, called a &quot;qilaut&quot; is played on the edge with a wooden beater called a qatuk. The performer tilts the drum from one side to another and dances in rhythm of the beats.

==Cultural role==

Traditionally Inuit languages did not have a word for what a European-influenced listener or ethnomusicologist&#x27;s understanding of &quot;music&quot;, &quot;and ethnographic investigation seems to suggest that the &quot;concept&quot; of music as such is also absent from their culture.&quot; The closest word, &quot;nipi&quot;, includes music, the sound of speech and noise. Traditionally, &quot;Eskimo songs seem to have been intended to be heard as parts of a whole—a series of auditory experiences.&quot;

Until the advent of commercial recording technology, Inuit music was usually used in spiritual ceremonies to ask the spirits (see Inuit religion) for good luck in hunting or gambling, as well as simple lullabies. Inuit music has long been noted for a stoic lack of work or love songs. These musical beginnings were modified with the arrival of European whalers, especially from Scotland and Ireland. Instruments like the accordion were popularized, and dances like the jig or reel became common. Scots-Irish derived American country music has been especially popular among Inuit in the 20th century.

==Katajjaq==
Katajjaq (also pirkusirtuk and nipaquhiit) is a type of traditional competitive, but cooperative, song, considered a game, usually held between two women. It is one of the world&#x27;s few examples of overtone singing, a unique method of producing sounds that is otherwise best known in Tuvan throat-singing. When competing, two women stand face-to-face and sing using a complex method of following each other, thus that one voice hits a strong accent while the other hits a weak, melding the two voices into a nearly indistinguishable single sound. They repeat brief motifs at staggered intervals, often imitating natural sounds, like those of geese, caribou or other wildlife, until one runs out of breath, trips over her own tongue, or begins laughing, and the contest is then over. &quot;The old woman who teaches the children corrects sloppy intonation of contours, poorly meshed phrase displacements, and vague rhythms exactly like a Western vocal coach.&quot;

==Influence from Western culture==
Contact with European explorers in the 16th and 17th centuries brought Western influence to Inuit music. The microtonality and rhythmic complexity of the music was replaced with structures more resembling the structures of Western music.

Many contemporary Inuit musicians now blend aspects of traditional Inuit music with mainstream popular music genres such as rock, pop and country music.

==Vocal games==
Inuit vocal games are usually played by two women facing each other in close proximity. They use the other participant&#x27;s oral cavity as resonators but may also play under a kitchen pot for the resonances to be more pronounced. The game consists of repeating meaningless words in tight rhythmic canon. The strong accent of one participant coincides with the weak of the other. The breathing of the players are thus also alternated. Vocal techniques include voiced and voiceless articulations and different articulations, and different placement of sound in the chest, throat and nose areas.

Vocal games are unique to the Inuit.

==Musical instruments==

===Percussion===
*The main percussion instrument is the wooden frame drum called the qilaut. It is made from boiling and bending strips of wood about two to three inches wide into a circular frame with a handle protruding out. Detailed animal skin, usually caribou, is stretched across the frame and fastened down with a string. The drum can reach one meter in diameter but are usually smaller, around one yard in length. It is struck on the edge of the rim by a qatuk, or a wooden beater. The resulting sound is a combination of the percussive attack from striking the wood and the resulting vibrations from the stretched membrane. Some groups such as the Inuvialuit living around the Mackenzie Delta use wands to beat the drums instead of thick wooden beaters.
*Other percussion instruments include smaller drums and rattles
*The Jew&#x27;s harp has also been introduced to the Inuit and is played by certain groups such as the Inuit in Eskimo Point (now Arviat) in Canada

===String instruments===
*The &quot;tautirut&quot; is an Inuit bowed zither, similar to the &quot;fiðla&quot; or Icelandic fiddle. It is not clear as to whether the instrument is purely indigenous, or introduced by Nordic sailors, either pre or post-Columbus. Inuit culture is one of the few cultures of the Americas to have a chordophone tradition.
*The &quot;kelutviaq&quot; is a one-string fiddle or lute played by the Yup&#x27;ik of Nelson Island and southwest Alaska

==Distribution==
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has been broadcasting music in Inuit communities since 1961, when CFFB was opened in Frobisher Bay, Northwest Territories (modern day Iqaluit, Nunavut). The CBC Northern Service played a critical role in the distribution and promotion of Inuit music; as an essential cultural link between the remote communities of the Canadian Arctic, it often served as the only venue for Arctic-based musicians to record a song or an album.

In 2016, the Nunavut-based band The Jerry Cans launched Aakuluk Music, the first Nunavut-based independent record label.

<text>Pinus taeda, commonly known as loblolly pine, is one of several pines native to the Southeastern United States, from East Texas to Florida, and north to southern New Jersey. The wood industry classifies the species as a southern yellow pine. U.S. Forest Service surveys found that loblolly pine is the second-most common species of tree in the United States, after red maple. For its timber, the pine species is regarded as the most commercially important tree in the Southeastern U.S. The common name loblolly is given because the pine species is found mostly in lowlands and swampy areas.

Loblolly pine is the first among over 100 species of &quot;Pinus&quot; to have its complete genome sequenced. As of March 2014, it was the organism having the largest sequenced genome size. Its genome, with 22 billion base pairs, is seven times larger than that of humans. As of 2018, assembly of the axolotl genome (32Gb) displaced loblolly pine as the largest assembled genome. The loblolly pine was selected as the official state tree of Arkansas in 1939.

==Description==
Loblolly pine can reach a height of with a diameter of . Exceptional specimens may reach tall, the largest of the southern pines. Its needles are in bundles (fascicles) of three, sometimes twisted, and measure long, an intermediate length for southern pines, shorter than those of the longleaf pine or slash pine, but longer than those of the shortleaf pine and spruce pine. The needles usually last up to two years before they fall, which gives the species its evergreen character. Needles are yellowish-green to grayish green.

Although some needles fall throughout the year due to severe weather, insect damage, and drought, most needles fall during the autumn and winter of their second year. The seed cones are green, ripening pale buff-brown, in length, broad when closed, opening to wide, each scale bearing a sharp spine long.

Bark is reddish brown and deeply fissured into irregular, broad, scaly plates on older trees. Branches are reddish-brown to dark yellowish brown.

Loblolly pines are one of the fastest growing pines making it a valuable species in the lumber industry. The lumber marketed as yellow pine lumber and similar usage to other southern pines such as the more stronger Longleaf and Shortleaf pines. They are also used as pulpwood. It grows at an average of 2 feet per year. The tallest loblolly pine currently known, which is tall, and the largest, which measures in volume, are in Congaree National Park.

==Etymology and taxonomy==
The word &quot;loblolly&quot; is a combination of &quot;lob&quot;, referring to thick, heavy bubbling of cooking porridge, and &quot;lolly&quot;, an old British dialect word for &quot;broth, soup, or any other food boiled in a pot&quot;. In the southern United States, the word is used to mean &quot;a mudhole; a mire,&quot; a sense derived from an allusion to the consistency of porridge. Hence, the pine is named as it is generally found in lowlands and swampy areas. Loblolly pines grow well in acidic clay soil, which is common throughout the South, thus are often found in large stands in rural places.

Other old names, now rarely used, include oldfield pine due to its status as an early colonizer of abandoned fields; bull pine due to its size (several other yellow pines are also often so named, especially large isolated specimens); rosemary pine due to loblolly&#x27;s distinctive fragrance compared to the other southern pines; and North Carolina pine.

For the scientific name, &quot;&quot; is the Latin name for the pines and &quot;&quot; refers to the resinous wood.

==Ecology==
With the advent of wildfire suppression, loblolly pine has become prevalent in some parts of the Deep South that were once dominated by longleaf pine and, especially in northern Florida, slash pine.

Its rate of growth is rapid, even among the generally fast-growing southern pines. The yellowish, resinous wood is prized for lumber, but is also used for wood pulp. This tree is commercially grown in extensive plantations.

Loblolly pine is the pine of the Lost Pines Forest around Bastrop, Texas, and in McKinney Roughs Nature Park along the Texas Colorado River. These are isolated populations on areas of acidic sandy soil, surrounded by alkaline clays that are poor for pine growth.

A study using loblolly pines showed that higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels may help the trees to endure ice storms better.

==Notable trees==
The famous &quot;Eisenhower Tree&quot; on the 17th hole of Augusta National Golf Club was a loblolly pine. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, an Augusta National member, hit the tree so many times that at a 1956 club meeting, he proposed that it be cut down. Not wanting to offend the President, the club&#x27;s chairman, Clifford Roberts, immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request outright. In February 2014, an ice storm severely damaged the Eisenhower Tree. The opinion of arborists was that the tree could not be saved and should be removed, which it subsequently was.

The &quot;Morris Pine&quot; is located in southeastern Arkansas; it is over 300 years old with a diameter of and a height of .

Loblolly pine seeds were carried aboard the Apollo 14 flight. On its return, the seeds were planted in several locations in the US, including the grounds of the White House. , a number of these moon trees remain alive.

==Genome==
Pines are the most common conifers and the genus &quot;Pinus&quot; consists of more than 100 species. Sequencing of their genomes remained a huge challenge because of the high complexity and size. Loblolly pine became the first species with its complete genome sequenced. This was the largest genome assembled until 2018, when the axolotl genome (32Gb) was assembled.

The loblolly pine genome is made up of 22.18 billion base pairs, which is more than seven times that of humans. Conifer genomes are known to be full of repetitive DNA, which make up 82% of the genome in loblolly pine (compared to only 50% in humans). The number of genes is estimated at 50,172, of which 15,653 are already confirmed. Most of the genes are duplicates. Some genes have the longest introns observed among fully sequenced plant genomes.

==Inbreeding depression==
Gymnosperms are predominantly outcrossing, but lack genetic self-incompatibility. Loblolly pine, like most gymnosperms, exhibits high levels of inbreeding depression, especially in the embryonic stage. The loblolly pine harbors an average load of at least eight lethal equivalents. A lethal equivalent is the number of deleterious genes per haploid genome whose cumulative effect is the equivalent of one lethal gene. The presence of at least eight lethal equivalents implies substantial inbreeding depression upon self-fertilization.

<doc id="435343" wikidata="Q3018090" url="?curid=435343" title="David Hookes">
<text>David William Hookes (3 May 1955 – 19 January 2004) was an Australian cricket player and coach. He played for the Australia national cricket team and domestic cricket for South Australia, later coaching Victoria. An aggressive left-handed batsman, Hookes usually batted in the middle order. His international career got off to a sensational start in the Centenary Test at Melbourne in 1977 when he hit England captain Tony Greig for five consecutive boundaries, but a combination of circumstances ensured that he never became a regular in the Australian team. He wrote in his autobiography, &quot;I suspect history will judge me harshly as a batsman because of my modest record in 23 Tests and I can&#x27;t complain about that&quot;.

For many years, he was a leading figure in Australian domestic cricket, most notably in his role as captain of South Australia (SA). &quot;Wisden&quot; called him &quot;a first-class destroyer of second-rate bowling&quot;. Angered by Victorian captain Graham Yallop&#x27;s late declaration in a Sheffield Shield match at the Adelaide Oval in October 1982, Hookes, who normally batted at number 3 or 4, promoted himself to opening batsman and proceeded to score a century from 34 balls in just 43 minutes (including 18 fours and two sixes), at the time the fastest century scored in first-class cricket. He finished his career as the highest run-scorer in Sheffield Shield history.

An outspoken man who had several brushes with the game&#x27;s officials, Hookes retired at the end of the 1991–92 season and pursued his media career. He moved to Melbourne in 1995 and broadcast on Radio 3AW. His popularity among players and his reputation for strong leadership led to his appointment as coach of the Victorian team in 2002. The team enjoyed success under his tutelage. He died after being punched by a hotel bouncer outside a pub where he had been drinking with Victorian players following their victory in a match earlier in the day.

==Cricket career==
Hookes grew up in Torrensville, South Australia. He played for the West Torrens Cricket Club and made his A-Grade debut at the age of just 15. When he came in to bat he faced Adelaide Cricket Club bowler and local Australian rules football and media personality Ken &quot;KG&quot; Cunningham. KG said later in a Channel 9 tribute to Hookes that after the first two balls went past the edge of the bat, he walked down the wicket and attempted to upset the youngster in his first game and &quot;gave him a huge spray&quot;. Hookes then sent the next four balls to the fence and after the over walked up to Cunningham and said: &quot;Listen old man, if you continue to bowl those wobbly little inswingers the next four will go over the fence and not into the fence.&quot; In later years KG became one of Hookes&#x27;s close friends and on Adelaide television and radio one of his strongest supporters even after his move to Melbourne to become coach of the Victorian state side.

David Hookes made his first-class debut in 1975–76 for South Australia. A rush of form in February 1977, when he scored five centuries from six innings in 17 days, led to his selection for the Centenary Test in March, 1977, at the age of 21.

===Test debut and WSC===
During Australia&#x27;s second innings of the match, Hookes made 56, and hit Tony Greig for five consecutive boundaries. Soon after, he signed a contract with World Series Cricket (WSC) and then toured England. Playing all five Tests, Hookes compiled 283 runs at 31.44, with scores of 85 at The Oval and 50 at Lord&#x27;s.

Australian Captain Ian Chappell described World Series Cricket (WSC) as the toughest cricket he ever played (with all the best players in the world involved)

Hookes was one of the key personalities marketed by the breakaway WSC organisation. In a Supertest at the Sydney Showground in 1977, a bouncer from Andy Roberts broke his jaw, and his confidence never fully recovered from the injury. Nevertheless, he was the third-best performed Australian batsman behind Ian and Greg Chappell with 770 runs (at 38.5 average) across the Supertests played during the 1977–78 / 78-79 and was in fact the best performed Australian batsmen across the 1978–79 Supertests with 392 runs (at 56 average). His future in the Australian team following the rapprochement between WSC and official cricket seemed assured.

===Problems post-WSC===
However, Hookes managed just one Test and two ODIs when injury curtailed his 1979–80 season. Returned to fitness, he toured Pakistan in 1980, but made a pair in the first Test at Karachi, dismissed twice by spin bowler Iqbal Qasim. His play against slow bowling had not developed and he was vulnerable to the well-flighted delivery as his footwork was non-existent. Dropped from the Australian team, his form failed to improve in the following Australian season, and he lost his place in the South Australia team as well.

The SACA took a gamble by appointing Hookes as South Australia captain at the start of the 1981–82 season. He responded to the challenge and led the state to the Sheffield Shield. Improved confidence and form led to his reinstatement in the Australian team for the 1982–83 Ashes series, and he batted consistently for 344 runs at 49.14 average with a best score of 68 in the fourth Test at Melbourne. Continuing his good form on the following tour of Sri Lanka, Hookes scored 143 off 152 balls in the first Test between the nations.

===Last seasons===
Hookes&#x27;s performances were more subdued during the 1983 World Cup in England. Australia played poorly in the tournament. When the team returned home, Hookes criticised the team&#x27;s captain, Kim Hughes. This earned him a fine and he was dropped from the 1983–84 Test series against Pakistan. He returned for five Tests in the West Indies during the 1984 tour and passed 20 in seven of his ten innings, yet made only one half-century, 51 at Antigua in the fourth Test.

Frustrated by Hookes&#x27;s failure to turn regular starts into big scores, the Australian selectors ignored him for the next 18 months. He was not selected for the 1985 tour of England, although there had been an exodus of Australian players on a rebel tour of South Africa. His last international appearances were in 1985–86, when he played two Tests against both New Zealand and India, and two ODIs in the World Series Cup. Thereafter, Australia pursued a selection policy of giving prolonged opportunities to younger players and passing over older players with inconsistent records.

===Domestic performances===
Despite his failure to live up to expectations at the highest level, Hookes continued to captain South Australia until 1990, when he was sensationally sacked. In October 1982, Hookes thrashed a 43-minute, 34-ball century, which in some respects is the fastest hundred in first-class history.
On 7–8 March 1987, Hookes and Wayne Phillips shared an unbroken fourth wicket stand of 462 for South Australia against Tasmania, with Hookes making his highest ever score of 306 not out coming in just 385 minutes from only 314 balls faced (Phillips scored 213 not out). Hookes&#x27; innings also included 40 fours and 2 sixes. Hookes and Wicket-keeper Phillips, both left-handed batsmen, broke the previous first-class partnership record of 456 set by Victorian pair Bill Ponsford and Edgar Mayne in the 1923–24 season against Queensland at the MCG.

Hookes also formed a devastating partnership with fellow South Australian left-hander Darren Lehmann, the pair often entertaining spectators at the Adelaide Oval in Shield matches with their attacking play. In all first-class cricket, Hookes scored 12,671 runs in 178 matches at an average of 43.99.

===Batting style===
Hookes was an aggressive strokeplayer against fast bowling, and was known to play the hook shot effectively. However he had problems playing spin. He was known as an &quot;eye&quot; player – or one who relied more on his eye than on sound batting technique.

==After retirement==
After his retirement, he became involved in the media, making appearances on television and hosting a radio programme on Melbourne radio station 3AW with fellow sportscaster Gerard Healy.

In 2002, he was selected as the new coach of the Victorian cricket team, a team he had grown up hating. He led a revival of the team, which had struggled in previous years. The team subsequently rose back to the top of the Australian domestic competition.

During August 2003, Hookes was criticised by his employers, Cricket Victoria, after his comment in reference to Helen Cohen Alon, a South African woman who had claimed Australian cricketer Shane Warne had sexually harassed her via telephone. Commenting on her as &quot;some dopey, hairy-backed sheila who has dobbed [Warne] in across the other side of the world. If that&#x27;s what she wants to do to earn some cash that&#x27;s her decision. Let&#x27;s find out the facts before we hang Warney on this one&quot;.

He accused the Australian selectors of bias towards players from New South Wales stating that &quot;when they give out the baggy blue cap in New South Wales, they give you a baggy green one in a brown paper bag as well to save making two presentations.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hookes married his childhood sweetheart and first wife Roxanne, but left her for his second wife, Robyn Gellman. They were married for 22 years. Hookes had two stepchildren. Hookes and Robyn separated in late 2003 due to Hookes&#x27;s infidelities. At the time of his death he had been in a two-year relationship with Christine Padfield, then marketing coordinator at Cricket Victoria, who was present when he died.

==Death==
On the night of 18 January 2004, Hookes went to the Beaconsfield Hotel in West St Kilda, Melbourne, with members of the Victorian and South Australian cricket teams, including future Australian coach Darren Lehmann, to celebrate a win by the former over the latter in a one-day match. Christine Padfield was also with Hookes, as was a friend of Padfield&#x27;s, Tania Plumpton. Soon after midnight, a brawl erupted between the party and hotel staff. There are conflicting stories about the reason. It seemed to have been generated by a &quot;last drinks&quot; call by hotel staff. It is also unclear whether the party left voluntarily or were forced to leave.

The hotel&#x27;s security staff continued following the party for a short distance outside the hotel. In the altercation that followed, one of the bouncers, Zdravko Mićević, punched Hookes. He fell to the ground, hitting his head in the process, and went into cardiac arrest. He was revived by paramedics but did not regain consciousness. He was taken to Melbourne&#x27;s Alfred Hospital and placed on life support. The following evening, after family and friends had said their sad goodbyes, Hookes was taken off life support and died soon after. Hookes was an organ donor and 10 people received transplanted organs.

A memorial service was held on Adelaide Oval on 27 January 2004, attended by all members of the Australian, South Australia and Victoria cricket teams, as well as the Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks. Attendance was estimated at 10,000. His estranged wife, Robyn, declined to participate in his memorial service, but sat in one of the outer grandstands.
Mićević was charged with manslaughter. The death of Hookes generated public outrage, with numerous death threats being received by Mićević and his lawyers. Mićević&#x27;s home was also subjected to an arson attack. Business at the Beaconsfield Hotel plummeted and the hotel closed its doors at the end of 2004.

During Mićević&#x27;s trial, witnesses gave conflicting testimony of what occurred and who started the fight. The jury acquitted Mićević.

<text>HMAS &quot;Bayonet&quot; (P 101) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Bayonet&quot; was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland in October 1968, launched on 6 November 1968, and commissioned on 22 February 1969.

==Operational history==
&quot;Bayonet&quot; was transferred to the Melbourne Port Division of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve on 27 March 1982.

==Fate==
&quot;Bayonet&quot; paid off on 26 June 1988. Although the vessel was retained by the Australian government, by 1999 she was in a dilapidated condition, so was scuttled on 21 September 1999, sinking off Cape Schanck, Victoria in Bass Strait, in an area known to divers as the Victorian Ships&#x27; Graveyard.

The wreck lies upright on the sand at a depth of . Sand ripples around the wreck are evidence of strong currents in the area. The deck is at an average depth of . There is a hole in the foredeck at the forward gun position, and there is a substantial amount of wiring still present inside the wreck which may be an entanglement hazard. Dives on he Bayonet require the use of trimix to limit nitrogen narcosis.

<doc id="435349" wikidata="Q2517691" url="?curid=435349" title="HMAS Benalla (J323)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Benalla&quot; (J323/M323), named for the city of Benalla, Victoria, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built by HMA Naval Dockyard in Victoria, &quot;Benalla&quot; was fitted out as armed survey ship instead of a minesweeper like the rest of the class, and was commissioned into the RAN in 1943.

&quot;Benalla&quot;″s duties included convoy escort and performing hydrological surveys prior to amphibious landing operations. The corvette was present at the Japanese surrender of Timor at the end of the war. Post-war, &quot;Benalla&quot; performed survey work around north-west Australia until late 1945. She was decommissioned in 1946, and sold for scrapping in 1958.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Benalla&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

Despite being part of a class of minesweepers, &quot;Benalla&quot; was fitted out as an armed survey ship. Minesweeping gear was not installed, and an extension to X deck housed a large chart room. Her role resulted in an increase from the standard ship&#x27;s company of 85 to 107.

&quot;Benalla&quot; was laid down at HMA Naval Dockyard in Williamstown, Victoria on 24 March 1942. She was launched on 19 December 1942 by the wife of Arthur Drakeford, serving Minister for the Air, and commissioned on 28 April 1943.

==Operational history==
&quot;Benalla&quot; entered service on 2 June 1943, towing an ammunition lighter from Sydney to Brisbane. She worked her way up the eastern Australia coast to New Guinea, escorting a small convoy between Townsville and Milne Bay, where she would be based as a survey vessel for the rest of 1943. Arriving in New Guinea waters in late June, the corvette was immediately assigned to support the landing of United States troops on Kiriwina Island and Woodlark Island on 30 June during Operation Chronicle; these landings were unopposed as there were no Japanese soldiers on the islands. From July to September, &quot;Benalla&quot; and sister ship led a Survey Group of vessels to perform hydrological surveys of the waters around Lae, Salamaua, and Finschhafen, in preparation of Australian troop landings at these locations. &quot;Benalla&quot; remained at Milne Bay until early December, when she proceeded to Sydney for refit.
Returning to survey work New Guinea in February 1944, the corvette was involved in the surveying of Seeadler Harbor and the waters around the Admiralty Islands following their capture by the United States as part of Operation Brewer in March and April. In August, she sailed for Brisbane to undergo a two-month refit. On 11 October, &quot;Benalla&quot; sailed for the Philippines via Hollandia, joining the escort of 20 Liberty ships on the second leg. In November, the corvette assisted frigate in surveying San Pedro Bay, before resuming work in the New Guinea area. On 6 January 1945, &quot;Benalla&quot; was sent to Darwin and assigned to a Survey Group operating off the north-western coast of Australia. She spent four months with the group, then was assigned to Fremantle from 3 May to 20 July. Returning to Darwin, &quot;Benalla&quot; was assigned to a joint Australian-Dutch group heading for Koepang, and was present when the Japanese surrender of Timor was carried out aboard on 11 September 1945.

The corvette was later awarded the battle honour &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot; in recognition of her wartime service.

&quot;Benalla&quot; resumed survey work off the north-west coast of Australia on her return from Timor, a role she would maintain until 2 November 1945, when she was ordered to Fremantle for decommissioning. The corvette was decommissioned into reserve on 28 January 1946. She was transferred from Fremantle to Melbourne, Geelong, then Sydney over the course of 1955 and 1956, and was sold to Mitsubishi Shoji Kaisha Ltd of Tokyo on 20 February 1958, who towed the vessel to Japan in April for scrapping.

<doc id="435351" wikidata="Q4668375" url="?curid=435351" title="Indigenous music of Canada">
<text>Indigenous music of Canada encompasses a wide variety of musical genres created by Aboriginal Canadians. Before European settlers came to what is now Canada, the region was occupied by many First Nations, including the West Coast Salish and Haida, the centrally located Iroquois, Blackfoot and Huron, the Dene to the North, and the Innu and Mi&#x27;kmaq in the East and the Cree in the North. Each of the indigenous communities had (and have) their own unique musical traditions. Chanting – singing is widely popular and most use a variety of musical instruments.

== History ==
Traditionally, Indigenous Canadians used the materials at hand to make their instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada. First Nation bands made gourds and animal horns into rattles, many rattles were elaborately carved and beautifully painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birchbark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. Drums and rattles are percussion instruments traditionally used by First Nations people. These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs are the background for dances. Many traditional First Nations people consider song and dance to be sacred. For many years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies. That is one reason why little information about First Nations music and musical instruments is available.

Traditionally Inuktitut did not have a word for what a European-influenced listener or ethnomusicologist&#x27;s understanding of &quot;music&quot;, &quot;and ethnographic investigation seems to suggest that the &quot;concept&quot; of music as such is also absent from their culture.&quot; The closest word, &quot;nipi&quot;, includes music, the sound of speech, and noise. (Nattiez 1990:56)

Today, a revival of pride in First Nations art and music is taking and beauty of traditional First Nations art, music and musical instruments. Drums are closely associated with First Nations people. Some people say, &quot;Drumming is the heartbeat of Mother Earth.&quot; First Nations made a great variety of drums. Healers sometimes use miniature drums. There are also tambourine-shaped hand drums, warrior drums, water drums, and very large ceremonial drums. Their size and shape depends on the First Nation&#x27;s particular culture and what the drummer wants to do with them. Many are beautifully decorated. In many First Nations cultures, &quot;the circle&quot; is important. It is the shape of the sun and moon, and of the path they trace across the sky. Many First Nations objects, such as tipis and wigwams, are circular in shape. Traditional villages were place. First Nations people are recovering the knowledge, history often arranged with the dwellings placed in a circle. To this day, many First Nations people hold meetings sitting in a circle. Meetings often begin with a prayer, with the people standing in a circle holding hands.

Hand carved wooden flutes and whistles are less common than drums, but are also a part of First Nations traditional music. Chippewa men played flutes to serenade girlfriends and to soothe themselves and others during hard times. The Cree, Iroquois and Maliseet made and used whistles. Archaeologists have found evidence that both wooden whistles and flutes were used by the Beothuk, an extinct tribe who lived in Newfoundland until the early days of European settlement. The human voice is the primary instrument of all First Nations. As it is in most ancient music, singing is the heart of First Nations traditions. Every song had an original owner. Songs belonged to a society, clan, rite, ceremony, or individual. In some cultures, one could buy the right to sing a song owned by an individual. The original owner would then teach the buyer to sing the song. Many traditional songs are still sung by First Nations people who follow traditional ways.

Many artists also now combine First Nations and Inuit music with mainstream popular music genres such as country, rock, hip hop or electronic dance music. The Polaris Music Prize went to Tanya Tagaq for &quot;Animism&quot; in 2014 and to Jeremy Dutcher for &quot;Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa&quot; in 2018 and for &quot;Motewolonuwok&quot; in 2024. (The 2017 Polaris went to Lido Pimienta for &quot;La Papessa&quot;; Pimienta is of South American indigenous descent. The 2015 Polaris went to Buffy Sainte-Marie for &quot;Power in the Blood&quot;. Sainte-Marie claimed First Nations heritage at the time, though investigative reporting in 2023 would contest this claim.)

The compilation album &quot;Native North America, Vol. 1&quot;, released by Light in the Attic Records in 2014, collects many rare and out-of-print songs by First Nations and Inuit musicians from the era in which the rock and country and folk genres were beginning to emerge as influences on Indigenous music.

== Music areas ==

=== Northeast Woodlands ===
Inhabiting a wide swath of the United States and Canada, Eastern Woodlands natives, according to Nettl, can be distinguished by antiphony (call and response style singing), which does not occur in other areas. Their territory includes Maritime Canada, New England, U.S. Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes and Southeast regions. Songs are rhythmically complex, characterized by frequent metric changes and a close relationship to ritual dance. Flutes and whistles are solo instruments, and a wide variety of drums, rattles and striking sticks are played. Nettl describes the Eastern music area as the region between the Mississippi river and the Atlantic. The most complex styles being that of the Southeastern Creek, Yuchi, Cherokee, Choctaw, Iroquois and their language group, the simpler style being that of the Algonquian language group including Delaware and Penobscot. The Algonquian speaking Shawnee have a relatively complex style influenced by the nearby southeastern tribes.

The characteristics of this entire area include short iterative phrases, reverting relationships, shouts before, during, and after singing, anhematonic pentatonic scales, simple rhythms and metre and, according to Nettl, antiphonal or responsorial techniques including &quot;rudimentary imitative polyphony&quot;. Melodic movement tends to be gradually descending throughout the area and vocals include a moderate amount of tension and pulsation.

===Plains===
Extending across the American Midwest into Canadian Prairies, Plains-area music is nasal, with high pitches and frequent falsettos, with a terraced descent (a step-by-step descent down an octave) in an unblended monophony. Strophes use incomplete repetition, meaning that songs are divided into two parts, the second of which is always repeated before returning to the beginning.

Large double-sided skin drums are characteristic of the Plains tribes, and solo end-blown flutes (flageolet) are also common.

Nettl describes the central Plains tribes, from Canada to Texas: Blackfoot, Crow, Dakota, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and Comanche, as the most typical and simple sub-area of the Plains-Pueblo music area. This area&#x27;s music is characterized by extreme vocal tension, pulsation, melodic preference for perfect fourths and a range averring a tenth, rhythmic complexity, and increased frequence of tetratonic scales. The musics of the Arapaho and Cheyenne intensify these characteristics, while the northern tribes, especially Blackfoot music, feature simpler material, smaller melodic ranges, and fewer scale tones.

Nettl Arapaho music includes ceremonial and secular songs, such as the ritualistic Sun Dance, performed in the summer when the various bands of the Arapaho people would come together. Arapaho traditional songs consist of two sections exhibiting terraced descent, with a range greater than an octave and scales between four and six tones. Other ceremonial songs were received in visions, or taught as part of the men&#x27;s initiations into a society for his age group. Secular songs include a number of social dances, such as the triple metre round dances and songs to inspire warriors or recent exploits. There are also songs said to be taught by a guardian spirit, which should only be sung when the recipient is near death.

===Northwest Coast===

Open vocals with monophony are common in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, though polyphony also occurs (this the only area of North America with native polyphony). Chromatic intervals accompanying long melodies are also characteristic, and rhythms are complex and declamatory, deriving from speech. Instrumentation is more diverse than in the rest of North America, and includes a wide variety of whistles, flutes, horns and percussion instruments.

Nettl describes the music of the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsimshian, Makah, and Quileute as some of the most complex on the continent, with the music of the Salish nations (Nlaka&#x27;pamux, Nuxálk, and Sliammon, and others directly east of the Northwest tribes) as being intermediary between these Northwest Coast tribes and Inuit music. The music of the Salish tribes, and even more so the Northwest coast, intensifies the significant features of Inuit music, their melodic movement is often pendulum-type (&quot;leaping in broad intervals from one limit of the range to the other&quot;). The Northwest coast music also &quot;is among the most complicated on the continent, especially in regard to rhythmic structure,&quot; featuring intricate rhythmic patterns distinct from but related to the vocal melody and rigid percussion. He also reports unrecorded use of incipient polyphony in the form of drones or parallel intervals in addition to antiphonal and responorial forms. Vocals are extremely tense, producing dynamic contrast, ornamentation, and pulsation, and also often using multiple sudden accents in one held tone.

===Arctic – Sub-Arctic===
Nettl describes Inuit music as recitative-like singing, complex rhythmic organization, relatively small melodic range averaging about a sixth, prominence of major thirds and minor seconds melodically, with undulating melodic movement.

====Inuit====
The Inuit are well known for Inuit throat singing or katajjaq, an unusual method of vocalizing found only in a few cultures worldwide. Narrow-ranged melodies and declamatory effects are common, as in the Northwest. Repeated notes mark the ends of phrases. 

Box drums, which are found elsewhere, are common, as a tambourine-like hand drum.

====Cree====

Much Cree song takes the form of repeated sections delineated by rests and melodic or rhythmic patterns, though not all repetitions are exact.

== Contributions of First Nations music to Canadian culture ==
===Edward Gamblin===

Edward Gamblin was a country rock singer-songwriter, who is widely credited as one of the most influential artists in the history and development of First Nations music as a genre, as one of the first artists ever to build a successful career by focusing primarily on First Nations audiences rather than pursuing crossover appeal.

===Donald Harvey Francks===
Donald Harvey Francks or &quot;Iron Buffalo&quot; born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was a drummer, poet, native nations champion, motorcyclist, author and peace activist. He was interested in Tibet and supports Greenpeace. He appeared many times at George&#x27;s Spaghetti House, a Toronto jazz club that was the equivalent of New York&#x27;s Birdland. He was also known to sit in on drums at the Colonial Tavern and other Toronto afterhours clubs and jazz venues.

===Robbie Robertson===
Robbie Robertson was a Canadian singer-songwriter, and guitarist. He is best known for his membership in The Band. He was ranked 78th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. Robertson was born to a Jewish father and a Mohawk mother and took his stepfather&#x27;s last name after his mother remarried. He had his earliest exposure to music at Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation, where he spent summers with his mother&#x27;s family. He studied guitar when he was a youth and wrote songs and performed since he was a teenager. From 1987 onwards, Robertson released a series of four solo albums.
His first was self titled followed by &quot;Storyville&quot;, &quot;Music for the Native Americans&quot;, and &quot;Contact from the Underworld of Redboy&quot;.

=== Jerry Alfred ===

First Nations singer and storyteller Jerry Alfred helps to preserve First Nations language and traditions. Jerry is the Northern Tutchone (too-SHOWnee)
&quot;Keeper of the Songs.&quot; He lives in Pelly Crossing, a village in central Yukon, 300 kilometres north of Whitehorse. He was born in the nearby community of Mayo.
Jerry managed to keep his Tutchone language despite many years spent in a residential school. Like his father before him, Jerry was named a Song Keeper at
birth. A Song Keeper collects songs and sings them at potlatches and other First Nations ceremonial occasions. A self-taught guitarist, Jerry combines
modern guitar techniques and the traditional music of his people. His 1994 recording, &quot;Etsi Shon&quot; (EET-seeshown) or &quot;Grandfather Song&quot; helps to

<text>John Casper Branner (July 4, 1850 – March 1, 1922) was an American geologist and academic who discovered bauxite in Arkansas in 1887 as State Geologist for the Geological Survey of Arkansas. He was chair of the Departments of Botany and Geology at Indiana University Bloomington and later at Stanford University. He was a member of the founding faculty at Stanford and served as the university&#x27;s second president. He served as president of the Geological Society of America in 1904. He was president of the Seismological Society of America in 1911. He was an expert in Brazilian geology, among many other things.

==Biography==

Branner was born in the town of New Market, Tennessee, where his father was a merchant. In 1852, the family went to live on a farm given to his father by his grandfather a mile east of Dandridge on the French Broad River. He grew up there and on an adjacent property to which the family moved in 1859. During the Civil War he was very anxious to join the Confederate army, and on two occasions left school for the purpose of enlisting. His age, however, prevented his being accepted; he was only thirteen.

In 1865, he went to school for a year at New Market and in 1867, he spent a year at Maryville College. He left that institution in 1868, and in 1869, went to Ithaca, New York, to attend Cornell University. He spent a year attending Ithaca Academy and entered Cornell in 1870, in the so-called classical course.

In 1874, without having completed his university studies, he went by way of Europe to Brazil with Charles Fred Hartt, then professor of geology at Cornell. In 1875, he was made assistant on the geological survey of Brazil and remained on that work until the survey was abolished by the government and Professor Hartt died. In 1879, he accepted a position as assistant engineer and interpreter for the São Cyriaco Gold Mining Company of Boston, and spent a year near Serro, state of Minas Geraes, in the diamond regions of Brazil. In 1881, he returned to the United States, but was sent back to South America by Thomas Edison in search of a vegetable fiber for use in his then newly invented incandescent electric lamp.

In 1882, he returned to Cornell University, completed his studies, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree. From 1883 to 1885, he was topographic geologist of the Geological Survey of Pennsylvania in the anthracite regions; in 1885, after receiving his Ph.D. from Indiana University, he was made professor of geology at Indiana University, a position he held until 1891, though he was absent on leave for several years. In 1886, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. In 1887, he was appointed State Geologist of the Geological Survey of Arkansas. As State Geologist, he exposed gold-mining swindles then operating in Arkansas, for which the citizens of Bear City, Arkansas, burned him in effigy, and the stock promoters tried to have him fired. In 1891, he was appointed professor and chair of the Department of Geology at the newly opened Stanford University, recruited by his colleague from Cornell and Indiana, Stanford President David Starr Jordan. When Jordan retired as president of Stanford in 1913, Branner was elected President of the university. He retired January 1, 1916, due to an age limit established by the university and was named President Emeritus.

While at Stanford he directed the Agassiz-Branner expedition to Brazil in 1899 and a second similar expedition in 1907–1908. He served on government commissions studying the Panama Canal and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. He published a grammar of the Portuguese language, based on his work in Brazil, which went to multiple editions.

In 1913, he greatly contributed to genealogical research of the Shenandoah Valley by privately publishing &quot;Casper Branner of Virginia and his Descendants&quot;, a 453-page work documenting the genealogy of the Branner family and in particular the descendants of his great-great-grandparents, Casper Branner (1729–1792) and wife Catherine (1730–1800).

He died in Palo Alto, California, in 1922.

==Legacy==
A dormitory building, Branner Hall, and the Branner Earth Sciences Library at Stanford are named after him. Two of his Stanford students, United States President Herbert Hoover and his wife Lou Henry Hoover, dedicated their English translation of the medieval mining classic &quot;De re metallica&quot; to Branner.

The mineral, brannerite, a uranium ore mineral, was named in his honor.

A fossil bonefish from Brazil, &quot;Brannerion&quot;, was named after him by Jordan in 1920; Branner had previously helped to describe one of the species (&quot;B. vestitum&quot;, previously &quot;Calamopleurus vestitus&quot;) that was assigned to the genus. A species of crab found in California, &quot;Cancer branneri&quot; now &quot;Romaleon branneri&quot; commonly known as the furrowed rock crab, was named after him in 1926.

<doc id="435355" wikidata="Q3303780" url="?curid=435355" title="Meadowlark Lemon">
<text>Meadowlark Lemon (born Meadow Lemon III; April 25, 1932 – December 27, 2015), was an American basketball player, actor, and Christian minister. For 22 years, he was known as the &quot;Clown Prince&quot; of the touring Harlem Globetrotters basketball team. He was a 2003 inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Ordained in 1986, in 1994 he started Meadowlark Lemon Ministries in Scottsdale, Arizona.

In one of his final interviews, basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain described Lemon as &quot;the most sensational, awesome, incredible basketball player I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. Fellow Wilmington great Michael Jordan called Lemon a &quot;true national treasure&quot; and a personal inspiration in Jordan&#x27;s youth.

==Early life==
Lemon was born in Wilmington, North Carolina and attended Williston Industrial School, graduating in 1952. He then matriculated at Florida A&amp;M University, but was soon drafted into the United States Army and served for two years in Austria and West Germany.

==Career==

===Basketball===
Lemon made his first basketball hoop out of a coat hanger, using an onion sack for a net and an empty Carnation milk can for a ball, with which he made his first shot.

Lemon first applied to the Globetrotters in 1954 at age 22, finally being chosen to play in 1955. In 1980, he left to form one of his Globetrotters imitators, the Bucketeers. He played with that team until 1983, then moved on to play with the Shooting Stars from 1984 to 1987. In 1988, he moved on to &quot;Meadowlark Lemon&#x27;s Harlem All Stars&quot; team. Despite being with his own touring team, Lemon returned to the Globetrotters, playing 50 games with them in 1994.

In 2000, Lemon received the John Bunn Award, the highest honor given by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame outside induction. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2003.

===Television appearances===
In the 1970s, an animated version of Lemon, voiced by Scatman Crothers, starred with various other Globetrotters in the Hanna-Barbera animated cartoon series &quot;Harlem Globetrotters&quot;. The animated Globetrotters also made three appearances in &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies.&quot;

Lemon appeared alongside Fred &quot;Curly&quot; Neal, Marques Haynes and his other fellow Globetrotters in a live-action Saturday-morning television show, &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters Popcorn Machine,&quot; in 1974–1975, which also featured Rodney Allen Rippy and Avery Schreiber.

In 1978, Lemon appeared in a memorable Burger King commercial by making a tower of burgers until he found a double-beef pickles and onions with no-cheese burger.

in 1979, Lemon guest-starred in an episode of the NBC television anthology series &quot;$weepstake$&quot;.

In 1980, Lemon appeared as the coach of the basketball team from &quot;The White Shadow&quot; in a series of guest skits for Order/Disorder week on &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot;.

In 1983, Lemon appeared on an episode of &quot;Alice&quot; entitled &quot;Tommy Fouls Out&quot;, and in a Charmin toilet paper commercial alongside Mr. Whipple (actor Dick Wilson).

In 1996 season 2 episode 5 of &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; titled &quot;Brain&#x27;s Song&quot; Meadowlark Lemon was Brain&#x27;s best friend in the parody of &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;.

In 2006, on episode of adult swim&#x27;s &quot;The Boondocks&quot; entitled &quot;The Itis&quot;, the name of Meadowlark was used as the name of the park that Ed Wuncler I mentions an interest in purchasing from the state.

In 2009, on FOX&#x27;s TV show &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, the name of Meadowlark Lemon was used for a dog&#x27;s name, a pet for the character of Rallo Tubbs. The dog died in the second episode.

===Other work===
In 1979, Lemon starred in the educational geography film &quot;Meadowlark Lemon Presents the World&quot; and joined the cast in season two of the short-lived television sitcom, &quot;Hello, Larry&quot;, to help boost the show&#x27;s ratings. In the same year, he played Rev. Grady Jackson in the movie &quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh.&quot; It was several years before he actually became an ordained minister.

He recorded a song, &quot;My Kids&quot; which was written by Dalton &amp; Dubarri. The song was produced by Dubarri, and released on Casablanca NB 969 in March, 1979. In The &quot;Cash Box&quot; Singles to Watch section, it was called Top 40 material by the reviewer.

In 1982, Lemon was featured in the Grammy-nominated video &quot;Fun &amp; Games&quot;, an interactive educational video produced by Optical Programming Associates and Scholastic Productions, on the then-emerging LaserDisc format.

==Personal life==
Lemon had 10 children: Richard, George, Beverly, Donna, Robin, Jonathan, Jamison, Angela, Crystal, and Caleb.

Lemon was born Meadow George Lemon but had his name legally changed to Meadowlark Lemon in 1969.

A born-again Christian, Lemon became an ordained minister in 1986 and received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Vision International University in Ramona, California, in 1988. He was also featured as a gospel singer in several Gaither Homecoming videos. In his last years, he took up residence in Scottsdale, where his Meadowlark Lemon Ministries, Inc. is located.

==Death==
Lemon died in Scottsdale, on December 27, 2015, at the age of 83. No cause of death was given.

<text>In corpus linguistics, a collocation is a series of words or terms that co-occur more often than would be expected by chance. In phraseology, a collocation is a type of compositional phraseme, meaning that it can be understood from the words that make it up. This contrasts with an idiom, where the meaning of the whole cannot be inferred from its parts, and may be completely unrelated.

There are about seven main types of collocations: adjective + noun, noun + noun (such as collective nouns), noun + verb, verb + noun, adverb + adjective, verbs + prepositional phrase (phrasal verbs), and verb + adverb.

Collocation extraction is a computational technique that finds collocations in a document or corpus, using various computational linguistics elements resembling data mining.

Collocations are partly or fully fixed expressions that become established through repeated context-dependent use. Such terms as &quot;crystal clear&quot;, &quot;middle management&quot;, &quot;nuclear family&quot;, and &quot;cosmetic surgery&quot; are examples of collocated pairs of words.

Collocations can be in a syntactic relation (such as verb–object: &quot;make&quot; and &quot;decision&quot;), lexical relation (such as antonymy), or they can be in no linguistically defined relation. Knowledge of collocations is vital for the competent use of a language: a grammatically correct sentence will stand out as awkward if collocational preferences are violated. This makes collocation a common focus for language teaching.

Corpus linguists specify a key word in context (KWIC) and identify the words immediately surrounding them, to illustrate the way words are used in practice.

The processing of collocations involves a number of parameters, the most important of which is the &quot;measure of association&quot;, which evaluates whether the co-occurrence is purely by chance or statistically significant. Due to the non-random nature of language, most collocations are classed as significant, and the association scores are simply used to rank the results. Commonly used measures of association include mutual information, t scores, and log-likelihood.

Rather than select a single definition, Gledhill proposes that collocation involves at least three different perspectives: co-occurrence, a statistical view, which sees collocation as the recurrent appearance in a text of a node and its collocates; construction, which sees collocation either as a correlation between a lexeme and a lexical-grammatical pattern, or as a relation between a base and its collocative partners; and expression, a pragmatic view of collocation as a conventional unit of expression, regardless of form. These different perspectives contrast with the usual way of presenting collocation in phraseological studies. Traditionally speaking, collocation is explained in terms of all three perspectives at once, in a continuum:

:Free combination ↔ bound collocation ↔ frozen idiom

==In dictionaries==

In 1933, Harold Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Second Interim Report on English Collocations&quot; highlighted the importance of collocation as a key to producing natural-sounding language, for anyone learning a foreign language. Thus from the 1940s onwards, information about recurrent word combinations became a standard feature of monolingual learner&#x27;s dictionaries. As these dictionaries became &quot;less word-centred and more phrase-centred&quot;, more attention was paid to collocation. This trend was supported, from the beginning of the 21st century, by the availability of large text corpora and intelligent corpus-querying software, making it possible to provide a more systematic account of collocation in dictionaries. Using these tools, dictionaries such as the &quot;Macmillan English Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English&quot; included boxes or panels with lists of frequent collocations.

There are also a number of specialized dictionaries devoted to describing the frequent collocations in a language. These include (for Spanish) &quot;Redes: Diccionario combinatorio del español contemporaneo&quot; (2004), (for French) &quot;Le Robert: Dictionnaire des combinaisons de mots&quot; (2007), and (for English) the &quot;LTP Dictionary of Selected Collocations&quot; (1997) and the &quot;Macmillan Collocations Dictionary&quot; (2010).

== Statistically significant collocation ==
Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test can be used to determine whether the occurrence of a collocation in a corpus is statistically significant. For a bigram formula_1, let formula_2 be the unconditional probability of occurrence of formula_3 in a corpus with size formula_4, and let formula_5 be the unconditional probability of occurrence of formula_6 in the corpus. The t-score for the bigram formula_1 is calculated as:

: formula_8

where formula_9 is the sample mean of the occurrence of formula_1, formula_11 is the number of occurrences of formula_1, formula_13 is the probability of formula_1 under the null-hypothesis that formula_3 and formula_6 appear independently in the text, and formula_17 is the sample variance. With a large formula_4, the &quot;t&quot;-test is equivalent to a &quot;Z&quot;-test.

<doc id="435365" wikidata="Q707811" url="?curid=435365" title="Philander C. Knox">
<text>Philander Chase Knox (May 6, 1853October 12, 1921) was an American lawyer, bank director, statesman and Republican Party politician. He represented Pennsylvania in the United States Senate from 1904 to 1909 and 1917 to 1921. He was the 44th United States Attorney General in the cabinet of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt from 1901 to 1904 and the 40th United States Secretary of State in the cabinet of William Howard Taft from 1909 to 1913.

Born in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, Knox became a prominent attorney in Pittsburgh, forming the law firm of Knox and Reed. With the industrialists Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Mellon, Knox also served as a director of the Pittsburgh National Bank of Commerce. In early 1901, he accepted appointment as United States Attorney General. Knox served under President William McKinley until McKinley was assassinated in September 1901, and Knox continued to serve under President Theodore Roosevelt until 1904, when he resigned to accept appointment to the Senate.

Knox won re-election to the Senate in 1905 and unsuccessfully sought the 1908 Republican presidential nomination. In 1909, President William Howard Taft appointed Knox to the position of United States Secretary of State. From that post, Knox reorganized the State Department and pursued dollar diplomacy, which focused on encouraging and protecting U.S. investments abroad. Knox returned to private practice in 1913 after Taft lost re-election. He won election to the Senate in 1916 and played a role in the Senate&#x27;s rejection of the Treaty of Versailles. Knox was widely seen as a potential compromise candidate at the 1920 Republican National Convention, but the party&#x27;s presidential nomination instead went to Warren G. Harding. While still serving in the Senate, Knox died in October 1921.

==Early life, education, and marriage==

Philander Chase Knox was born in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, one of nine children of Rebecca (née Page) and David S. Knox, a banker. He was named after the Episcopal Bishop Philander Chase. He attended public school in Brownsville, graduating at the age of 15. He attended West Virginia University for a time, and then Mount Union College, where he graduated in 1872 with a bachelor of arts degree. While there, he formed a lifelong friendship with William McKinley, the future U.S. president, who at the time was a local district attorney. Knox then returned to Brownsville, and was occupied for a short while as a printer at the local newspaper, then as a clerk at the bank where his recently deceased father had worked. Soon he left for Pittsburgh, and studied law while working at the law offices of H. R. Swope &amp; David Reed in Pittsburgh.

===Marriage and family===

In 1880, Knox married Lillian &quot;Lillie&quot; Smith, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Darsie Smith. Her father was a partner in a steel company known as Smith, Sutton and Co. The company eventually became a part of Crucible Steel. Knox and his wife had several children, including Hugh Knox. His extended relatives include a nephew, &quot;Billy&quot; Knox. 

==Legal career==
Knox was admitted to the bar in 1875 and practiced in Pittsburgh. From 1876 to 1877, he was Assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Knox became a leading Pittsburgh attorney in partnership with James Hay Reed, their firm being Knox and Reed (now Reed Smith LLP). In 1897 Knox became President of the Pennsylvania Bar Association. Along with Jesse H. Lippencott, a fellow member of an elite hunting club (see South Fork below), Knox served as a director of the Fifth National Bank of Pittsburgh. With Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Mellon, he was a director of the Pittsburgh National Bank of Commerce. As counsel for the Carnegie Steel Company, Knox took a prominent part in organizing the United States Steel Corporation in 1901. 

===Johnstown Flood===

Knox was a member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, which had a clubhouse upriver of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. It maintained an earthen dam for a lake by the club, which was stocked for fishing. The dam failed in May 1889, causing the Johnstown Flood and severe losses of life and property downriver. When word of the dam&#x27;s failure was telegraphed to Pittsburgh, Frick and other members of the South Fork Club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for assistance to the flood victims.

As its attorneys; Knox and his law partner Reed were able to fend off four lawsuits against the club; Colonel Unger, its president; and against 50 named members. The cases were &quot;either settled or discontinued and, as far as is known, no one bringing action profited thereby.&quot;

The club was never held legally responsible for the disaster. Knox and Reed successfully argued that the dam&#x27;s failure was a natural disaster which was an Act of God, and no legal compensation was paid to the survivors of the flood. The perceived injustice aided the acceptance of “strict, joint, and several liability,” so that a “non-negligent defendant could be held liable for damage caused by the unnatural use of land.

==Political career==

===U.S. Attorney General===

In 1901, Knox was appointed as US Attorney General by President William McKinley and was re-appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt. He served until 1904. While serving President Roosevelt, Knox worked hard to implement the concept of Dollar Diplomacy.

He told President Roosevelt: &quot;I think, it would be better to keep your action free from any taint of legality,&quot; made in regard to the construction of the Panama Canal.

===U.S. Senator===
In June 1904, Knox was appointed by Governor Samuel W. Pennypacker of Pennsylvania to fill the unexpired term of the late Matthew S. Quay in the United States Senate. In 1905, he was elected by the state legislature to fill the remainder of the full term for the US Senate seat (to 1909). 

Knox made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican Party nomination in the 1908 U.S. presidential election.

===U.S. Secretary of State===
In February 1909, President-elect William Howard Taft nominated Senator Knox to be Secretary of State. He was at first found to be constitutionally ineligible, because Congress had increased the salary for the post during his Senate term, thus violating the Ineligibility Clause. In particular, Knox had been elected to serve the term from March 4, 1905 to March 3, 1911. During debate on legislation approved on February 26, 1907, as well as debate beginning on March 4, 1908, he had consistently supported pay raises for the Cabinet, which were eventually instituted for the 1908 fiscal calendar. The discovery of the constitutional complication came as a surprise after President-elect Taft had announced his intention to nominate Knox.

The Senate Judiciary Committee proposed the remedy of resetting the salary to its pre-service level, and the Senate passed it unanimously on February 11, 1909. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives mounted more opposition to the relief measure and defeated it once. After a special procedural rule was applied, the measure was passed by a 173–115 vote. On March 4, 1909, the salary of the Secretary of State position was reverted from $12,000 to $8,000, and Knox took office on March 6. Later known as the &quot;Saxbe fix&quot;, such legislation has been passed in a number of similar circumstances.

Knox served as Secretary of State in Taft&#x27;s cabinet until March 5, 1913. As Secretary of State, he reorganized the Department on a divisional basis, extended the merit system to the Diplomatic Service up to the grade of chief of mission, pursued a policy of encouraging and protecting American investments abroad, declared the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, and accomplished the settlement of controversies related to activities in the Bering Sea and the North Atlantic fisheries.

Under Taft the focus of foreign policy was the encouragement and protection of U.S. investments abroad called Dollar diplomacy. This was first applied in 1909, in a failed attempt to help China assume ownership of the Manchurian railways. Knox felt that not only was the goal of diplomacy to improve financial opportunities, but also to use private capital to further U.S. interests overseas. When the Zionist Literary Society sought endorsement from the Taft administration, Knox recommended against approval, noting in his assessment that &quot;problems of Zionism involve certain matters primarily related to the interests of countries other than our own.&quot; In spite of successes, &quot;dollar diplomacy&quot; failed to counteract economic instability and the tide of revolution in places like Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and China.

===Return to the Senate===

Following his term of office, Knox resumed the practice of law in Pittsburgh. In 1916, Knox was elected by popular vote to the Senate from Pennsylvania for the first time, after passage of the Seventeenth Amendment providing for such popular elections. He served from 1917 until his death in 1921. While a Senator, he was highly critical of the Treaty of Versailles ending World War I, saying &quot;this Treaty does not spell peace but war — war more woeful and devastating than the one we have but now closed&quot;.

At the 1920 Republican National Convention, Knox was considered a potential compromise candidate who could unite the progressive and conservative factions of the party. Many thought that California Senator Hiram Johnson would release his delegates to back his friend Knox, but Johnson never did. Warren G. Harding instead emerged as the compromise candidate, and Harding went on to win the 1920 election. After the election, Knox urged President Harding to consider Andrew Mellon for the position of Secretary of the Treasury, and Mellon ultimately took the position.

In April 1921, he introduced a Senate resolution to bring a formal end to American involvement in World War I. It was combined with a similar House resolution to create the Knox–Porter Resolution, signed by President Warren G. Harding on July 2.

==Personal life==
Knox&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Sleepy Phil,&quot; as he was said to have dozed off during board meetings, or because he was cross-eyed.

Knox was a member of the elite Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh.

==Death==
Knox died in Washington, D.C., on October 12, 1921, aged 68.

<doc id="435368" wikidata="Q271656" url="?curid=435368" title="Janick Gers">
<text>Janick Robert Gers (; born 27 January 1957) is an English musician who is best known as one of the three guitarists in heavy metal band Iron Maiden since 1990. He initially joined to replace Adrian Smith, but remained in the band after Smith rejoined in 1999. Gers was previously a member of Gillan and co-founder of the band White Spirit in 1975.

==Career==
Gers began his career as the lead guitarist of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal band White Spirit, appearing on their debut self-titled album in 1980, before leaving in 1981 to join Gillan, replacing Bernie Torme in the group formed by then-former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan. Gers first performance with Gillan was on Top of the Pops, and Gers would go on to record two albums with the band before Ian Gillan disbanded the group at the end of 1982. 

After Gillan disbanded, Gers undertook a Humanities degree before joining Gogmagog, which included former Iron Maiden vocalist Paul Di&#x27;Anno and drummer Clive Burr. The project would ultimately come to nothing. Gers would later contribute, and perform on, the track &quot;View from the Hill&quot; on former Marillion vocalist Fish&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors&quot;, released in 1990. In 1989 Gers was asked to record the song &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot; with Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson for the soundtrack to &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child&quot;; this project then expanded into Dickinson&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;.

During the recording of &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;, Gers was asked to join Iron Maiden in place of Adrian Smith. He has remained with the band ever since, even after Smith rejoined the band in 1999, contributing to a total of ten studio albums.

==Influences, musical style and performance style==
Gers&#x27; playing style uses heavy distortion and is noted for having a very raw tone. He prefers alternate picking instead of playing legato using hammers and pull-offs. Gers&#x27; main influences are Ritchie Blackmore, Jeff Beck and Rory Gallagher. 

He is noted for his energetic stage presence, which often involves dancing, prancing, and performing tricks with his guitar, such as throwing it into the air and catching it.
Gers is known for his dynamic on-stage performances, which have occasionally led to mishaps. In one instance, his guitar was catapulted off-stage during one of his antics after losing control of its neck. On another occasion, he risked serious injury by losing his footing while strutting on stage, falling violently to the ground, which caused apparent concern from bandmate Adrian Smith.
He is also left-handed although he plays guitar right-handed; he can be seen signing autographs with his left hand in the &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; DVD.

Along with Dave Murray and Adrian Smith (also Iron Maiden guitarists), he shares fourth place on Metal Hammer&#x27;s list of the greatest metal guitarists of all time.

==Personal life==
Gers graduated from English Martyrs School and Sixth Form College in the 1970s, and earned a college degree in sociology and English literature after leaving Gillan in the 1980s. He has two children with his wife Sandra, and lives in Yarm, Teesside. His son Dylan also plays guitar and has released ambient post rock tracks as both a solo artist and with Noah Yorke, son of Radiohead singer Thom Yorke 

Gers has Polish ancestry via his father, Bolesław, who was an able seaman of the Polish Navy and served on ORP Burza and ORP Błyskawica on which he came to England during World War 2, and later he joined the Royal Navy. Bolesław Gers remained in England after the war, married Janick&#x27;s British mother Louise in 1956 and had 4 children of which Janick is the oldest.

Gers has relatives in the Bydgoszcz area and Sośno village in Poland and visited them regularly as a teenager from 1972 and until 1977. Gers bought his first guitar during one of those visits, in a music store in Złotów close to Piła. Gers met his Polish family again after 34 years at a 2011 concert in Warsaw.

Gers is a fan of Hartlepool United and is a season-ticket holder in the Neale Cooper Stand at Victoria Park.

Gers had an uncredited part in the BBC drama &quot;The Paradise Club&quot; in 1990, appearing as the lead guitarist of a band called Fraud Squad. He appeared in the 2010 fan-made Iron Maiden documentary &quot;Maiden Heaven&quot;.

==Musical equipment==
Gers is a long-time proponent of the Fender Stratocaster. His guitars are typically black or white with rosewood fingerboards and Seymour Duncan JB Jr. and Hot Rails pick-ups. His favourite guitar over the years has been a black Stratocaster, equipped with JB Jr. pick-ups, which was given to him by Ian Gillan. Gers uses four different Fender Stratocasters, as well as a Gibson Chet Atkins semi-acoustic model for songs such as &quot;Dance of Death&quot;. Gers is currently endorsed by Sandberg Guitars, and he uses a California ST-S tobacco hc-aged and a California ST-S creme hc-aged model on stage.

Like his bandmates, Dave Murray and Adrian Smith, Gers currently uses the Marshall JMP-1 preamp through a Marshall 9200 power amp. Preferring not to use foot-switches while playing, Gers&#x27; roadie operates his MIDI Foot Controller offstage. Favouring cables, Gers only uses a Shure UR4D wireless system when he throws his guitar around. He uses Ernie Ball Regular Slinky nickel-wound guitar strings.

<doc id="435372" wikidata="Q466852" url="?curid=435372" title="Under the Net">
<text>Under the Net is a 1954 novel by Iris Murdoch. It was Murdoch&#x27;s first published novel. Set in London, it is the story of a struggling young writer, Jake Donaghue. Its mixture of the philosophical and the picaresque has made it one of Murdoch&#x27;s most popular novels.

It is dedicated to Raymond Queneau. When Jake leaves Madge&#x27;s flat in Chapter 1, two of the books he mentions taking are &quot;Murphy&quot; by Samuel Beckett, and &quot;Pierrot mon ami&quot; by Queneau, both of which are echoed in this story. The epigraph, from John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Secular Masque&quot;, refers to the way in which the main character is driven from place to place by his misunderstandings.

In 2005, the novel was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the one hundred best English-language novels since 1923. The editors of Modern Library named the work as one of the greatest English-language novels of the twentieth century.

==Explanation of the title==
The &quot;net&quot; in question is the net of abstraction, generalization, and theory. In Chapter 6, a quotation from Jake&#x27;s book &quot;The Silencer&quot; includes the passage: &quot;All theorizing is flight. We must be ruled by the situation itself and this is unutterably particular here. Indeed it is something to which we can never get close enough, however hard we may try as it were to crawl under the net.&quot;

Michael Wood, writing in the &quot;London Review of Books,&quot; notes that &quot;&quot;&quot;the work’s title... borrows and interrogates an image [of Newtonian mechanics] from Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus.&quot;&quot; Peter J. Conradi, in his 2001 biography of Iris Murdoch, specifies that &quot;the title alludes to Wittgenstein’s &quot;Tractatus,&quot; 6, 341, the net of discourse behind which the world&#x27;s particulars hide, which can separate us from our world, yet simultaneously connect us.&quot; According to Conradi, Hugo Belfounder is &quot;a portrait of Wittgenstein&#x27;s star pupil from 1937, Yorick Smythies.&quot;

==Plot summary==
In this lightly comic novel about work, love, wealth and fame the main character is Jake Donaghue, a struggling writer and translator. He seeks to improve his circumstances and make up for past mistakes by reconnecting with his old acquaintance Hugo Belfounder, a mild mannered and soft-spoken philosopher.

Jake, a shameless mooch and hack-writer—now homeless and out of other solid options—tracks down his ex-girlfriend, Anna Quentin, and her elegant sister, an actress named Sadie. He also reacquaints himself with Hugo, whose philosophy Jake had long ago presumptuously tried to decipher and interpret to his own liking. The plot develops through a series of adventures involving Jake and his offbeat minion, Finn. From the kidnapping of a movie-star canine to the staging of a political riot on a film set, Jake attempts to discover and incorporate Hugo&#x27;s abstruse philosophies in real life situations. Berated yet enlightened, Jake&#x27;s aspirations to become a true writer/philosopher may at last be at hand.

===Chapters 1–5: Thrown out===
Jake Donaghue has just arrived back in London from a trip to France. Finn, a distant relative who is so obliging that he is sometimes mistaken for a servant, tells Jake that they are being thrown out of Madge&#x27;s house, where they have been living rent-free for eighteen months. A conversation with Madge reveals that they are being moved to make way for her new lover, the rich bookmaker Sammy Starfield.

He goes with his suitcase to the cat-filled corner shop of Mrs Tinckham to check he has all his manuscripts and figure out where to live. Only one manuscript is missing: his translation of &quot;Le Rossignol de Bois&quot;, a novel by Jean-Pierre Breteuil. It is a mediocre work which he has done for money. He thinks of an old friend, a philosopher named Dave Gellman, and goes to his flat. A political meeting is being held there, and Dave is dismissive, but allows him to leave his suitcase. Finn suggests that he ask Anna Quentin, (a singer he once fell in love with) for help.

Jake has not seen Anna for several years. He eventually tracks her down to the Riverside Miming Theatre, on Hammersmith Mall, and finds her in a prop room &quot;like a vast toy shop&quot;. She is happy to see him, but somewhat uncomfortable when he asks about her new project, involving mime. She suggests that he ask her film-star sister, Sadie, for help. After she leaves he spends the night sleeping in the prop room.

The next morning Jake goes to Welbeck Street to look for Sadie, and learns that she is at her Mayfair hairdresser. He spruces himself up, and goes to talk to her. She is very happy to see him there, and asks him to look after her flat while she hides from an admirer named Hugo Belfounder, a fireworks manufacturer who now owns a film studio.

It so happens that Hugo was a former friend of Jake&#x27;s. They had met long ago as fellow participants in a cold-cure experiment, and had had long philosophical discussions which Jake, without Hugo&#x27;s knowledge, had turned into a book called &quot;The Silencer&quot;. Because Hugo believed that language was corrupt, Jake felt that creation of the book was a kind of betrayal, and had unilaterally broken off the friendship after its publication, not wishing to face Hugo&#x27;s anger.

Jake goes back to Madge&#x27;s to fetch his radio, and finds Sammy there. Jake is prepared to fight, but the bookmaker is friendly and even offers him money to make up for having disrupted his life. This leads to a series of bets being placed by phone; they win £633 10s, and Sammy promises to send him a cheque for that amount.

===Chapters 6–10: Anna and Hugo===
Jake goes to Sadie&#x27;s flat to begin housesitting and is surprised to see a copy of &quot;The Silencer&quot; on a bookshelf, wondering whether Hugo had given it to her. His pleasure in the flat&#x27;s luxury is soon destroyed: firstly by a call from Hugo, asking for Miss Quentin (he hangs up when he hears Jake), and secondly by the discovery that he has been deliberately locked in. He calls from the window to his friends, Dave and Finn, who pick the lock and rescue him. Jake resolves to find Hugo, who he thinks must love Anna, and must have given her the idea for the mime theatre.

The three men take a taxi to Holborn Viaduct. They find Hugo&#x27;s door open, and a note left saying &quot;Gone to the pub&quot;. This begins a pub crawl; they do not find Hugo, but get very drunk. At the Skinners&#x27; Arms, they are joined by Lefty Todd, a political activist. After Lefty subjects Jake to a kind of Socialist catechism, they go for a walk, and all but Dave have a swim in the Thames. The next morning, Dave belatedly hands Jake a letter from Anna; she wants to see him as soon as possible. He rushes to the Riverside Theatre, but everything has been packed up, and she is gone. Devastated, he takes a ride in the lorry carrying away the contents of the prop room.

Jake goes back to Sadie&#x27;s flat to purloin her copy of &quot;The Silencer&quot;, but on approaching her door he overhears a conversation between her and Sammy about his most recent translation. His prolonged eavesdropping attracts the puzzled attention of neighbours, but he manages to deduce that Sadie and Sammy are planning to use his translation of &quot;Le Rossignol de Bois&quot; as the basis of a film proposal, and that they are not planning to recompense him for its use. He is furious.

===Chapters 11–13: Mister Mars===
With the help of Finn, Jake breaks into Sammy&#x27;s flat in Chelsea to take the typescript, but they cannot find it; instead, on the spur of the moment, Jake decides to kidnap Sammy&#x27;s filmstar dog, an Alsatian named Mr Mars, for the purposes of blackmail. They cannot open the dog&#x27;s cage, and so with great difficulty they carry the whole cage away and file through the bars to get the dog out. A brief newspaper article reveals to Jake that Anna is travelling to Hollywood, via Paris.

Accompanied by Mr Mars, Jake&#x27;s search for Hugo takes him to Bounty Belfounder Studio, in South London. A huge crowd has gathered on a film set of Ancient Rome; they are listening to a political speech delivered by Lefty Todd. It is the first time in years that Jake has seen Hugo, and he drags him away to talk to him, but the sudden arrival of the United Nationalists causes a riot, and they have to run. Their attempts to escape the violence, which involve the improvised use of explosives, cause the collapse of the set. When the police arrive and announce that &quot;no-one is to leave&quot;, Jake manages to evade questioning by telling Mr Mars to play dead, and carrying him out in his arms, supposedly to find a vet.

Jake has to walk all the way back, and spends the night sleeping on a bench. On arriving back at Dave&#x27;s he finds the cheque from Sammy for £600. Wondering what to do with Mr Mars, Jake asks Dave for help in drafting a blackmail letter, and after much discussion they decide to demand £100. Two telegrams arrive from Madge, bearing a job offer in Paris and an order of £30 for travel expenses. But Dave has to tell Jake that Sammy has cancelled the huge cheque. In dismay, they together decide to pool £50 for a bet on Lyrebird; then Jake leaves for France.

===Chapters 14–16: Paris===
In Paris, Jake is amazed to discover that Jean-Pierre Breteuil&#x27;s latest novel, &quot;Nous les Vainqueurs&quot;, has won the Prix Goncourt, and having dismissed Breteuil&#x27;s work for so long he is amazed and envious. Madge&#x27;s offer turns out to be a kind of film industry sinecure, and he finds himself refusing it with distaste for reasons that he cannot explain.

He realises that it is Bastille Day, and he wanders the city for hours in a daze. In the evening, he is watching fireworks when he sees Anna. He tries to follow her, but the crowd impedes him. He nearly catches up with her in a park, after she leaves her shoes to walk barefoot on the grass. But he briefly loses sight of her, and the woman he accosts is not her.

Jake returns to London the next morning to find that Lyrebird has won at long odds, 20–1. Finn has taken his share of the money and disappeared. Several torpid days of inactivity follow, to the despair of Dave.

===Chapters 17–20: The hospital===
Jake takes a job as an orderly at a hospital. When Hugo is admitted (he has been hit in the head with a brick at a political meeting), Jake sees his chance for a serious conversation with his old friend. But as an orderly he is strongly discouraged from talking to patients, and he decides to come back in the middle of the night. He leaves the window of a store-room open.

With an immensity of pains, Jake succeeds in reaching Hugo&#x27;s room shortly after one in the morning. The conversation is not at all what he expected: Hugo is not at all angry with Jake, and it turns out that while Anna is indeed besotted with Hugo, Hugo himself is in love with Sadie, and Sadie with Jake—not a love triangle, but a one-way love diamond. Hugo demands that Jake help him escape. Jake does so, but they are seen by the hostile porter, Stitch, and Jake knows that he has lost his job.

When Jake next goes to Hugo&#x27;s flat, he finds that Hugo has gone, leaving all he owns to Lefty and his political party. At Mrs Tinckham&#x27;s, he reads letters from Finn and Sadie. Finn has gone back to Ireland, as he always said he would; Sadie is suggesting he buy Mr Mars for £700, and although this puts Jake back at square one financially, he decides it is the only possible course of action. With Mrs Tinckham, he listens to Anna singing on the radio, and having made his peace with Hugo and with &quot;The Silencer&quot; he realises that his literary career is just beginning.

<doc id="435373" wikidata="Q7708182" url="?curid=435373" title="Texas Towers">
<text>Texas Towers were a set of three radar facilities off the eastern seaboard of the United States which were used for surveillance by the United States Air Force during the Cold War. Modeled on the offshore oil drilling platforms first employed off the Texas coast, they were in operation from 1958 to 1963. After the collapse of one of the towers in 1961, the remaining towers were closed due to changes in threat perception and out of a concern for the safety of the crews.

==Planning==
Upon re-formation of the Air Defense Command in 1951 to oversee the nation&#x27;s developing surveillance radar network, there was concern that shore-based radars along the east coast provided insufficient warning time. A 1952 report from MIT&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory looked into the possibility of extending radar coverage by building platforms in the Atlantic using offshore oil drilling technology. They concluded that a set of such platforms, equipped with radars, could extend coverage several hundred miles offshore, giving half an hour additional warning of an attack. Funding for design and construction of the towers was approved in January 1954.

==Design==
Each tower consisted of a triangular platform, on each side, standing on three caisson legs. The structures were constructed on land, towed to site, and jacked up to clear the sea surface by . Radar and other equipment were then installed on location.
The platform itself contained two floors housing the living areas; two of the legs held fuel oil for diesel generators, while the third held the intake for the desalination unit. The platform roof served as a helicopter landing area. A rotary gantry was suspended from the platform to allow servicing of its underside.

Each platform was equipped with one AN/FPS-3 (later upgraded to AN/FPS-20) search radar and two AN/FPS-6 height finder radars, each housed in a separate spherical neoprene radome in diameter. Originally the towers were to be linked to shore by submarine cable, but this was eventually rejected as too costly; the AN/FRC-56 tropospheric scatter microwave link was installed instead, with an array of three parabolic antennas attached to one edge of the platform. UHF and VHF equipment allowed communication with ships and aircraft as well as providing a backup to the microwave link.

==Installations==

Five towers were planned, in an array off the New England/mid-Atlantic coast. The most northerly two proposed were dropped from plans due to budgetary constraints.

Logistical support for all three towers was provided by the 4604th Support Squadron, based out of Otis AFB and specifically constituted for this mission. They were originally equipped with H-21B helicopters, which were replaced with three Sikorsky SH-3 helicopters acquired in 1962. The was used to supply the stations, with transfer being effected with a platform called the &quot;donut&quot;, consisting of an inflated rubber ring surmounted by a railing, which was lowered from the platform to the waiting ship&#x27;s deck. These transfers could only take place at slack tide, when the ship could maintain position.

==Operational history==
Texas Tower 2 was the first to become operational, starting limited service in May 1956. It became fully operational in 1958, as did Tower 3; Tower 4 followed in April 1959. The original plan to integrate these radars into the SAGE system had to be modified when the direct cable connection was eliminated; instead, they were used to provide manual inputs.

All the towers were noisy and prone to vibration from the equipment. The relative flexibility of the supports also caused them to shake and sway in response to wind and waves. The frequent and sustained sounding of the platform&#x27;s foghorns was also an annoyance to the crew.

=== Texas Tower 4 ===

Tower 4 was plagued with structural problems from the start. It stood in much deeper water than the other two - , compared to for Tower 2 - and it was held that the simple cylindrical leg design would not be sturdy enough given the length of the legs. Therefore, three sets of cross braces were added between the legs, attached with pin joints. These made it impossible to tow the platform on the level; instead, the structure was laid on its side for transport and then tipped upright at the site. These braces proved to be frail and the joints prone to loosening: two braces broke loose during transport, and a third was lost when the tower was being placed on the bottom. Divers were brought in several times to inspect the structure and to perform repairs, and an additional set of crossbraces was installed immediately below the platform, above the waterline, in 1960. Crewmen were frequently seasick from the swaying, and Tower 4 was nicknamed &quot;Old Shaky&quot;.

On September 12, 1960, Hurricane Donna passed over Tower 4, causing severe structural damage, including the loss of the flying bridge hanging beneath the platform, and one of the communications dishes. After assessment of the damage and initial repairs it was decided to reduce staffing to a skeleton crew and prepare to dismantle the station. The site could not simply be abandoned for fear that the Soviets would board it and remove sensitive equipment and documentation. Dismantling of the tower was therefore protracted. At the approach of another storm in January 1961, evacuation of the station was impeded by the inability of the commander to make contact with any of his three immediate superiors; nonetheless the &quot;New Bedford&quot; set out for the platform. As the storm built, , which was in the vicinity, was also dispatched with the intent of evacuating the station via helicopter, shore aircraft being unable to take off. Both ships reached the vicinity but could do no more than watch the station disappear from their radar. No survivors were recovered, though divers were sent down on the chance that some might have been trapped in the wreckage. Twenty-eight airmen and civilian contractors perished. Only two bodies were recovered.

=== Texas Tower 5 ===

Texas Tower 5 was planned to be built on Brown&#x27;s Bank, south of the coast of Nova Scotia in of water. The 4604th Support Group was supposed to be located at Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire. The USAF approved the construction of Tower #5 on January 11, 1954, but the tower was never built because of improvements to radar over the area.

=== Closure ===
The loss of Tower 4, together with the increasing emphasis on ICBMs as the predominant threat, led a reassessment of the remaining towers. Escape capsules were added to the two remaining towers, allowing rapid evacuation. Shortly thereafter it was decided to close the remaining towers, and the electronic equipment was removed. Both platforms were expected to be returned to shore for scrap, but Tower 2 sank and could not be recovered. Tower 3 was then filled with foam before being knocked off its support, and it was successfully returned to shore and dismantled. The wreckage of Towers 2 and 4 remains in place on the ocean floor. Radar coverage was taken over by alterations to EC-121 airborne early warning flights based out of Otis Air Force Base.

<doc id="435374" wikidata="Q752281" url="?curid=435374" title="The Soundhouse Tapes">
<text>The Soundhouse Tapes is the debut EP by Iron Maiden, and features the first recordings by the band. Released on 9 November 1979, it features three songs taken from the demo tape recorded at Spaceward Studios on 30 and 31 December 1978. The three tracks (&quot;Iron Maiden&quot;, &quot;Invasion&quot; and &quot;Prowler&quot;) appear in a rougher form than they would on the band&#x27;s eponymous debut studio album and subsequent singles, as they were all recorded in one session.

Although major retail chains tried to order large quantities of the record, the band only distributed 5,000 copies, available by mail order alone, which sold out in just a few weeks. Because of this, the EP is now a valuable collectors item, having been sold at up to £1750 on online auctions.
==Background and recording==
In the midst of punk rock&#x27;s peak in the UK, Iron Maiden struggled to secure gigs out of the East End of London and decided that a demo would be an ideal way to try to remedy this. The band decided to record at Spaceward Studios, Cambridge after hearing a demo tape recorded there by former vocalist Dennis Wilcock&#x27;s band, V1. Although this would be more expensive than recording in London, bassist Steve Harris comments, &quot;We decided that doing it on the cheap was a false economy. We knew we&#x27;d only probably get one go at it, and we wanted it to sound the best we could.&quot;

To save money, the band booked a session New Year&#x27;s Eve weekend 1978 (30/31 December) which cost them £200, and recorded four songs, &quot;Prowler&quot;, &quot;Invasion&quot;, &quot;Strange World&quot; and &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;. Harris states, &quot;We didn&#x27;t know what to expect, going into the studio for the first time. We just hoped the engineer was gonna be good enough to record us, and that was it, really. We just went in there with a naïve attitude and, as it happens, it was pretty good. The songs were very together already. We didn&#x27;t have to arrange much. They were very tight, &#x27;cause we were doing them live all the time. We knew exactly what we needed to do. It was just a question of whether we could record it all in time. But we went in and the tracks went down really quick. I think we did most of them in the first take.&quot;

Following this New Year&#x27;s Eve session, the band were due to return a few weeks later to remix and rerecord some parts, however, according to guitarist Dave Murray, &quot;they wanted an extra £50 off us for the master tape and we just didn&#x27;t have it on us at the time. And when we went back, two weeks later, they&#x27;d already wiped the master and put something else over it! We couldn&#x27;t believe it. So, in the end, we just had to put it out as it was, which was all from that one mad session down in Cambridge on New Years Eve.&quot; In defence of Spaceward&#x27;s actions, Mike Kemp, the engineer, has since stated that &quot;we were as poor as they were and couldn&#x27;t afford to keep £60 multi-track tapes for every band either... We did our best - I think for £5 a week we would hold them until either they were paid for or the band decided not to keep them any longer, e.g. after a remix. Presumably they did not take that option.&quot;

==Distribution and EP release==

A short time later, Harris and Murray presented a copy of the tape to a DJ named Neal Kay, then running a heavy metal club in Kingsbury, North West London called the Bandwagon Soundhouse. Impressed with the demo, Kay began playing the tape heavily and eventually &quot;Prowler&quot; reached No. 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published in &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine. In addition to gaining the band exposure in &quot;Sounds&quot;, the demo tape also reached Rod Smallwood, who would soon become the group&#x27;s manager and help them acquire their record deal with EMI Records in December 1979.

In late 1979, while waiting to sign their deal with EMI, the band decided to release the demo on their own label, Rock Hard Records, on 9 November 1979. Entitled &quot;The Soundhouse Tapes&quot; after Kay&#x27;s club, Steve Harris explains that they decided to release the EP &quot;because everywhere we&#x27;d go we&#x27;d do really well at the gigs, and then afterwards there&#x27;d be, like, all these fans asking where they could buy one of our records and when we told &#x27;em there wasn&#x27;t any yet they couldn&#x27;t believe it. They&#x27;d seen the charts in &quot;Sounds&quot; and a lot of &#x27;em just assumed we must already have a record deal of some kind, but we didn&#x27;t. Not then. So then, they&#x27;d be, like, &#x27;Well, where can we get a copy of the tape?&#x27; And I think that&#x27;s when we really got the idea of putting the Spaceward demo out as an actual record.&quot; Although the original demo had included four songs, &quot;Strange World&quot; was excluded from the record as the band were unsatisfied with the quality of the track&#x27;s production.
==Reception and legacy==
Deciding to release the EP as a memento for fans, the group only printed 5,000 copies, 3,000 of which were sold by mail order in the first week. The EP was so successful that Rod Smallwood reports that several fans asked for copies of &quot;The Soundhouse Tapes&quot; at their local record stores, to the point where HMV and Virgin tried to order 20,000 copies each. Smallwood states, &quot;we could have really cashed in at that point. It was our record, not EMI&#x27;s, and we could have made enough to clear our debts, if we&#x27;d wanted to, maybe got it in the charts, even. But there was just no way. It really was something special for the true die-hard Maiden fans, and we&#x27;d already made that quite clear. If we&#x27;d changed our minds, just to get our hands on a bit of cash, it would have been selling out the kids who&#x27;d gone to all the trouble to send in for one of the original 5,000 copies. We thought, &#x27;No, we&#x27;ll wait until we can do it properly with EMI.&#x27;&quot;

Today, the EP is considered a valuable collector&#x27;s item, with &quot;Record Collector&quot; reporting in 2011 that copies of the original have been purchased at up to £800. The three tracks on it, along with the unreleased recording of &quot;Strange World&quot; from the same sessions, were later reissued on the 4-LP edition of the band&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Best of the Beast&quot;. As stated the former editor of the German magazine Rock Hard, Götz Kühnemund, Iron Maiden were (and still are) the inspiration for all the heavy metal bands we know today because they&#x27;re an intrinsically heavy metal group. It is equally important for those who play power metal, speed, thrash, death, black, hard rock – almost every genre. Iron Maiden took hard rock from the &#x27;70s, took it into the&#x27; 80s, and created a new genre that didn&#x27;t exist before. This band with independently distributed &quot;The Soundhouse Tapes&quot; demo introduced a DIY approach to all rock music and inspired next generations of new coming bands around the world.

<text>The Reichskonkordat (&quot;Concordat between the Holy See and the German Reich&quot;) is a treaty negotiated between the Vatican and the emergent Nazi Germany. It was signed on 20 July 1933 by Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli, who later became Pope Pius XII, on behalf of Pope Pius XI and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen on behalf of President Paul von Hindenburg and the German government. It was ratified 10 September 1933 and it remains in force to this day. The treaty guarantees the rights of the Catholic Church in Germany. When bishops take office, Article 16 states they are required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the German Reich established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began after it had been signed and intensified afterwards. The Church protested, including in the 1937 &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; encyclical of Pope Pius XI. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church&#x27;s influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities.

The &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; is the most controversial of several concordats that the Vatican negotiated during the pontificate of Pius XI. It is frequently discussed in works that deal with the rise of Hitler in the early 1930s and the Holocaust. The concordat has been described by some as giving moral legitimacy to the Nazi regime after Hitler had acquired quasi-dictatorial powers through the Enabling Act of 1933, an Act itself facilitated through the support of the Catholic Centre Party.

The treaty places constraints on the political activity of German clergy of the Catholic Church. With passage of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, for example, a policy of nonintervention was followed. The majority of the German church hierarchy regarded the treaty as a symbol of peace between church and state. From a Catholic Church perspective, it has been argued that the Concordat prevented even greater evils being unleashed against the Church. Though some German bishops were unenthusiastic, and the Allies at the end of World War II felt it inappropriate, Pope Pius XII successfully argued to keep the concordat in force. It is still in force.

==Background==
The &#x27;Reichskonkordat&#x27; between Germany and the Holy See was signed on 20 July 1933 and ratified in 10 September of that year. The treaty was an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria Concordats have been used to create binding agreements to safeguard church interests and its freedom to act, particularly in countries that do not have strong jurisprudence guaranteeing government non-interference in religious matters or where the church seeks a privileged position under government patronage.

===&quot;Kulturkampf&quot;===

Accounts of 20th-century diplomatic relations between Germany and the Vatican commonly take as their starting point the political scene in the late 19th century. German Chancellor Bismarck&#x27;s &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (&quot;Battle for Culture&quot;) of 1871–78 saw an attempt to influence a Protestant vision of nationalism over the new German Empire, and fused anticlericalism with suspicion of the Catholic population, whose loyalty was presumed to lie with Austria and France. The Catholic Centre Party had formed in 1870, initially to represent the religious interests of Catholics and Protestants, but was transformed by the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; into the &quot;political voice of Catholics&quot;. Bismarck&#x27;s &quot;Culture Struggle&quot; was largely a failure.

Bismarck sought to restrict the power of the Catholic Church in Germany. He regarded the Roman Church as &quot;the enemy within&quot;. His &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; included the disbanding of Catholic organizations, confiscation of church property, banishment or imprisonment of clergy, and an ongoing feud with the Vatican. According to novelist James Carroll, the end of &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; signaled &quot;that the Church had successfully resisted to his face the man [Bismarck] who, according to an admiring Henry Kissinger, was &#x27;outmaneuvered&#x27; by nobody.&quot; The Catholic Church&#x27;s firm resistance to Bismarck and &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;, including passive resistance by the Church in general and the excommunication of collaborating priests, has been used as benchmark for assessing the Church&#x27;s response to the Nazis from the early 1930s through World War II.

===End of World War I===
A formal realignment of Church and state relationships was considered desirable in the aftermath of the political instability of 1918 and the adoption of the Weimar constitution for the Reich along with the new constitutions in the German states in 1919. Key issues that the Church hoped to resolve related to state subsidies to the Church, support for Catholic schools, the appointment of bishops and the legal position of the clergy. The Reich government, in turn, wished for reasons of foreign policy to have friendly relations with the Holy See. Also, Germany wanted to prevent new diocesan boundaries from being established which would dilute Germany&#x27;s ties to ceded German territories in the east such as Danzig and Upper Silesia.

Negotiations relating to specific points, rather than a general concordat, took place between 1919 and 1922. But even after subsequent feelers were put out between the two parties the negotiations failed, primarily because both the Reichstag and Reichsrat were dominated by non-Catholic majorities who, for a variety of reasons, did not want a formal pact with the Vatican. In the absence of an agreement relating to particular areas of concern with the Reich, the Holy See concluded more wide-ranging concordats with three German states where Catholics were concentrated: Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929), and Baden (1932).

===Pope Pius XI===
Pius XI was elected Pope in 1922. His pontificate coincided with the early aftermath of the First World War. The old European monarchies had been largely swept away and a new and precarious order formed across the continent. In the East, the Soviet Union arose. In Italy, the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini took power, while in Germany, the fragile Weimar Republic collapsed with the Nazi seizure of power. Pope Pius&#x27;s major diplomatic approach was to make concordats. However, wrote Hebblethwaite, these concordats did not prove &quot;durable or creditable&quot; and &quot;wholly failed in their aim of safeguarding the institutional rights of the Church&quot; for &quot;Europe was entering a period in which such agreements were regarded as mere scraps of paper&quot;.

In 1929, Pius signed the Lateran Treaty and a concordat with Italy, confirming the existence of an independent Vatican City state, in return for recognition of the Kingdom of Italy and an undertaking for the papacy to be neutral in world conflicts. In Article 24 of the concordat, the papacy undertook &quot;to remain outside temporal conflicts unless the parties concerned jointly appealed for the pacifying mission of the Holy See&quot;. Other major concordats included those signed with Germany (1933), Austria (1935), Yugoslavia (1935), and Latvia (1938). The concordats were generally observed by the countries involved, with the exception of Germany.

In October 1929, General Groener pushed the German Foreign Ministry for resolution with the Vatican regarding military chaplains who lacked the ability to administer the sacraments of baptism or matrimony without first obtaining the permission of the local priest or bishop. Groener wanted the military to have their own bishop rather than rely on local ordinaries and it was this particular issue that was to mark an important step in the discussions that would ultimately be realized in the concordat with the Vatican. In March 1930, the new Papal Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli, gave indications that the Vatican would be interested in a concordat with the Reich in the event of any reforms of the Reich&#x27;s constitution having an adverse effect on the validity of the concordats already agreed between the German states and the Vatican.

Discussions between the two parties took place between 1931 and 1932 and at one point representatives of the Reich pointed out that Italy had an army Archbishop with Cardinal Pacelli indicating that was because Italy had signed a comprehensive concordat with the Vatican. The German negotiators continued to discuss solely on the basis of particular points rather than a general concordat during 1931 but even these were felt to be unlikely to be passed by the Reichstag or the Reichsrat, no matter their political or theological leanings.

==Nazi period==
===Nazis take power===
In January 1933, Hitler became Chancellor. The passing of the Enabling Act on 23 March, in part, removed the Reichstag as an obstacle to concluding a concordat with the Vatican. In the discussion of the Act, Hitler offered the Reichstag the possibility of friendly co-operation, promising not to threaten the Reichstag, the President, the States, or the Churches if granted the emergency powers. With Nazi paramilitary encircling the building, he said: &quot;It is for you, gentlemen of the Reichstag to decide between war and peace.&quot; The Act allowed Hitler and his Cabinet to rule by emergency decree for four years, though Hindenburg remained President.

German Catholics were wary of the new government:
In early 1933, Hitler told Hermann Rauschning that Bismarck had been stupid in starting a &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; and outlined his own strategy for dealing with the clergy which would be based initially on a policy of toleration:
We should trap the priests by their notorious greed and self-indulgence. We shall thus be able to settle everything with them in perfect peace and harmony. I shall give them a few years&#x27; reprieve. Why should we quarrel? They will swallow anything in order to keep their material advantages. Matters will never come to a head. They will recognise a firm will, and we need only show them once or twice who is the master. They will know which way the wind blows.

An initially mainly sporadic persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the Nazi takeover. Hitler was hostile to the Catholic Church, but he was also mindful that Catholics were a large proportion of the population in Germany: almost 40% in 1933. As such, for political reasons, Hitler was prepared to restrain his anticlericalism and did not allow himself to be drawn into attacking the Church publicly as other Nazis would have liked him to do. Kershaw wrote that, following the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor by President von Hindenberg, the Vatican was anxious to reach agreement with the new government, despite &quot;continuing molestation of Catholic clergy, and other outrages committed by Nazi radicals against the Church and its organisations&quot;.

In March 1933, the British Roman Catholic periodical &quot;The Tablet&quot; in an article titled &quot;The Ides of March&quot; said: [Hitler&#x27;s] Dictatorship is a usurpation and his enforcement of it is a brutality. While we write these lines, with news of more arrests and repressions coming to us every hour, we remember that we have reached the Ides of March and the anniversary of a never-forgotten assassination. But Nazism&#x27;s daggers cannot slay what is noblest and best in Germany. The Church, now that the Centre is no longer the key-group in German politics, may be persecuted; but HITLER will not succeed where BISMARCK failed.

Robert Ventresca wrote that because of increasing harassment of Catholics and Catholic clergy, Cardinal Pacelli sought quick ratification of a treaty with the government, seeking in this way to protect the German Church. When Vice-Chancellor Papen and Ambassador to the Vatican Diego von Bergen met Pacelli in late June 1933, they found him &quot;visibly influenced&quot; by reports of actions being taken against German Catholic interests.

The Church was keen on coming to terms with Hitler as he represented a strong resistance against Communism. The Papal Nuncio in Berlin (Cesare Osenigo) is reported to have been jubilant about Hitler&#x27;s rise to power and thought that the new government would soon be offering the same concessions to the Church that Mussolini had made in Italy. Historian Michael Phayer balances Lewy and author and journalist John Cornwell stating:

===Negotiations===
The Catholic bishops in Germany had generally shown opposition to Hitler from the beginning of his rise to power. When the Nazi Party polled six million votes during the 14 September 1930 election, the Catholic hierarchy called on its people to examine their consciences. During the next two years, bishops continued to pronounce against unacceptable policies of the Nazi Party. When Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933, the bishops maintained support for the Catholic Centre Party (), which in turn refused to assent to a proposal that would allow Hitler to assume full power. On 12 March 1933, Pope Pius XI received the German Cardinal Faulhaber in Rome. On his return Faulhaber reported:
After my recent experience in Rome in the highest circles, which I cannot reveal here, I must say that I found, despite everything, a greater tolerance with regard to the new government. ... Let us meditate on the words of the Holy Father, who in a consistory, without mentioning his name, indicated before the whole world in Adolf Hitler the statesman who first, after the Pope himself, has raised his voice against Bolshevism.

At a cabinet meeting on 20 March 1933, Hitler was confident that the Centre Party had now seen the necessity of the Enabling Act and that &quot;the acceptance of the Enabling Act also by the would signify a strengthening prestige with regard to foreign countries.&quot; Early in March 1933, the bishops recommended that Catholics vote for the Centre Party in the elections scheduled for 5 March 1933. However, two weeks later the Catholic hierarchy reversed its previous policy: allowing the Centre Party and the Bavarian Catholic Party to vote for the Enabling Act which gave Hitler dictatorial powers on 23 March. German Catholic theologian Robert Grosche described the Enabling Act in terms of the 1870 decree on the infallibility of the Pope, and stated that the Church had &quot;anticipated on a higher level, that historical decision which is made today on the political level: for the Pope and against the sovereignty of the Council; for the Fuhrer and against the Parliament.&quot; On 29 March 1933 Cardinal Pacelli sent word to the German bishops to the effect that they must change their position with regard to National Socialism. On 28 March 1933, the bishops themselves took up a position favourable to Hitler. According to Falconi (1966), the about-face came through the influence and instructions of the Vatican. Pope Pius XI indicated in &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; (1937) that the Germans had asked for the concordat, and Pope Pius XII (the former Cardinal Pacelli) affirmed this in 1945.

Falconi viewed the Church&#x27;s realignment as motivated by the desire to avoid being left alone in opposition and to avert reprisals. After the leader of the Centre Party, Monsignor Kaas, had persuaded the party members to vote for Hitler and the Enabling Act, he left immediately for Rome, and on his return on 31 March he was received by Hitler. He returned to Rome accompanied by the Catholic Vice-chancellor von Papen on 7 April with a mandate from Hitler to sound out a concordat with the Vatican. On the day they set out for Rome to prepare the way for the concordat, the first two anti-Semitic laws (excluding non-Aryans from public office and from the legal profession) were issued in Germany, but this did not impede the discussions. Papen recorded in his memoirs that on his arrival in Rome, the Pope &quot;greeted me with paternal affection, expressing his pleasure that at the head of the German State was a man like Hitler, on whose banner the uncompromising struggle against Communism and Nihilism was inscribed.&quot; In Falconi&#x27;s opinion the concordat was the price paid by Hitler to obtain the support of the German episcopate and the Catholic parties. Ian Kershaw viewed the loss of political Catholicism as the sacrifice needed to protect the position of the Catholic Church in Germany. According to historian Michael Phayer, the view &quot;that the Concordat was the result of a deal that delivered the parliamentary vote of the Catholic Center Party to Hitler, thereby giving him dictatorial power (the Enabling Act of March 1933) ... is historically inaccurate&quot;.

Cardinal Faulhaber wrote to Cardinal Pacelli on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong &quot;because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves&quot;—the latter assertion based on the outcome of the April boycott, which in spite of Nazi efforts had been mostly ignored and abandoned after only one day.

On 22 April 1933, the British Minister to the Vatican recounted what the Vatican Under-Secretary of State had told him: &quot;The Holy See is not interested in the Centre Party. We are more concerned with the mass of Catholic voters in Germany than in the Catholic deputies who represent them in the Reichstag.&quot; Previously, as part of the agreement surrounding the 1929 Lateran Treaty with the Fascist government in Italy, the Vatican had consented to the dissolution of Partito Popolare, which had seen support among the Italian clergy. It had been previously dissolved in 1926.

At a 26 April meeting with Bishop Wilhelm Berning of Osnabrück, representative of the German Bishops&#x27; Conference, Hitler declared:

I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.

The notes of the meeting do not record any response by Berning. In the opinion of Martin Rhonheimer, who cites the above transcript, &quot;This is hardly surprising: for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was really nothing terribly objectionable in this historically correct reminder. And on this occasion, as always, Hitler was concealing his true intentions.&quot; Saul Friedländer interpreted Hitler&#x27;s comments as an attempt to &quot;blunt possible Catholic criticism of his anti-Jewish policies and to shift the burden of the arguments onto the Church itself.

Edith Stein—later canonized as Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross—wrote a letter to Pius XI in April 1933 about the persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany. Her letter was sent personally via the Arch-Abbott of Beuron. The text of the letter is easily accessible on the internet. She never asked him to issue an encyclical on the matter, as some have contended. The Arch-Abbott received an answer from Cardinal Pacelli, the future Pius XII. See above, Hubert Wolf. (Edith Stein was murdered in the gas chamber at Auschwitz on 9 August 1942).

The issue of the concordat prolonged Kaas&#x27;s stay in Rome, leaving the Centre Party without a chairman, and on 5 May Kaas finally resigned from his post. The party then elected Heinrich Brüning as its chairman. At that time, the Centre party was subject to increasing pressure in the wake of the process of Gleichschaltung and after all the other parties had dissolved (or were banned, like the SPD). The Centre Party dissolved itself on 5 July 1933, as the concordat between the Vatican and the Nazis had dealt it a decisive blow by exchanging a ban on the political activities of priests for the continuation of Catholic education. Cardinal Pacelli and von Papen initialled the concordat in Rome three days later, with signing taking place on 20 July. On 2 July, the Vatican daily newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; insisted that the concordat was not an endorsement of Nazi teachings.

On 13 July, a British minister had an interview with Cardinal Pacelli and reported: &quot;His Eminence said that the Vatican really viewed with indifference the dissolution of the Centre Party.&quot;

At the 14 July cabinet meeting, Hitler brushed aside any debate on the details of the concordat, expressing the view &quot;that one should only consider it as a great achievement. The concordat gave Germany an opportunity and created an area of trust which was particularly significant in the developing struggle against international Jewry.&quot; Saul Friedländer said that Hitler may have countenanced in this &quot;area of trust&quot; what he perceived as the Christian Church&#x27;s traditional theological antipathy towards Jews (see Hitler&#x27;s comments above to Berning on 26 April) converging with Nazi aims. Hitler &quot;underlined the triumph&quot; that the Concordat meant for the Nazi regime. Only a short time earlier he had expressed doubts that &quot;the church would be ready to commit the Bishops to this state. That this has happened, was without doubt an unreserved recognition of the present regime.&quot;

On 22 July 1933, von Papen attended a meeting of the Catholic Academic Union during which he first made the connection between the dissolution of the Centre Party and the concordat. He said the Pope was particularly pleased at the promised destruction of Bolshevism and that Pius XI had agreed to the treaty &quot;in the recognition that the new Germany had fought a decisive battle against Bolshevism and the atheist movement.&quot; Papen stated &quot;an undeniable inner connection between the dissolution of the German Center party that has just taken place and the conclusion of the Concordat&quot; and ended his speech with a call for German Catholicism to put away former resentments and to help build Nazi Germany. Abbot Herwegen told the meeting:
What the liturgical movement is to the religious realm, fascism is to the political realm. The German stands and acts under authority, under leadership – whoever does not follow endangers society. Let us say &#x27;yes&#x27; wholeheartedly to the new form of the total State, which is analogous throughout to the incarnation of the Church. The Church stands in the world as Germany stands in politics today.

On 23 July, a British minister met Cardinal Pacelli who appeared &quot;very satisfied&quot; with the signing of the concordat. The cardinal expressed the view that, with the guarantees given relating to Catholic education, this concordat was an improvement over the 1929 agreement with Prussia. Cardinal Pacelli did sound a note of caution in that his satisfaction was based on the assumption that the German Government &quot;remained true to its undertaking&quot;, but said also that Hitler &quot;was becoming increasingly moderate&quot;.

On 24 July, Cardinal Faulhaber sent a handwritten letter to Hitler, noting that &quot;For Germany&#x27;s prestige in the East and the West and before the whole world, this handshake with the papacy, the greatest moral power in the history of the world, is a feat of immeasurable importance.&quot;

On 4 August 1933, the British Minister reported &quot;in conversations I have had with Cardinal Pacelli and Monsignor Pizzardo, neither gave me the feeling of the slightest regret at the eclipse of the Centre [Party], and its consequent loss of influence in German politics&quot;. On 19 August, Ivone Kirkpatrick had a further discussion with Cardinal Pacelli in which he expressed his &quot;disgust and abhorrence&quot; at Hitler&#x27;s reign of terror to the diplomat. Pacelli said &quot;I had to choose between an agreement on their lines and the virtual elimination of the Catholic Church in the Reich.&quot; Pacelli also told Kirkpatrick that he deplored the persecution of the Jews, but a pistol had been held to his head and that he had no alternative, being given only one week to decide. Pinchas Lapide said that while negotiations for the concordat were taking place, pressure had been put on the Vatican by the arrest of ninety-two priests, the searching of Catholic youth-club premises, and the closing down of nine Catholic publications. The Nazi newspaper &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; wrote: &quot;By her signature the Catholic Church has recognised National Socialism in the most solemn manner. ... This fact constitutes an enormous moral strengthening of our government and its prestige.&quot;

The concordat was ratified on 10 September 1933 and Cardinal Pacelli took the opportunity to send a note to the Germans raising the topic of the social and economic condition of Jews who had converted to Catholicism but not of Jews in general.

Meanwhile, although the Protestant churches, being local congregations, remained unaffected by restrictions on foreign support, Hitler&#x27;s government negotiated other agreements with them which in essence put Nazi officials, most of whom were Catholics, into positions of influence or outright authority over Protestant churches. Foreseeing the potential for outright State control of their churches which these agreements portended, many Protestant church leaders simply reorganized their congregations out of the agreements, causing a schism within the Protestant Churches. These Protestant resisters attempted to rally Catholic prelates to the dangers portended by these agreements, but were simply rebuffed when the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; was ratified. Many of the Protestant clergy who opposed the Nazi religious program (&quot;Bekennende Kirche&quot; or Confessing Church) later suffered imprisonment or execution.

Church leaders were realistic about the concordat&#x27;s protections. Cardinal Faulhaber is reported to have said: &quot;With the concordat we are hanged, without the concordat we are hanged, drawn and quartered.&quot; After the signing of the concordat, the papal nuncio exhorted the German bishops to support Hitler&#x27;s régime. The bishops told their flocks to try to get along with the Nazi régime. According to Michael Phayer, the concordat prevented Pius XI from speaking out against the Nazi Nuremberg Laws in 1935, and though he did intend to speak out after the nationwide pogrom of 1938, Cardinal Pacelli dissuaded him from doing so.

On 20 August 1935, the Catholic Bishops conference at Fulda reminded Hitler that Pius XI had:
exchanged the handshake of trust with you through the concordat – the first foreign sovereign to do so. ... Pope Pius spoke high praise of you. ... Millions in foreign countries, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, have overcome their original mistrust because of this expression of papal trust, and have placed their trust in your regime.
In a sermon given in Munich during 1937, Cardinal Faulhaber declared:

At a time when the heads of the major nations in the world faced the new Germany with reserve and considerable suspicion, the Catholic Church, the greatest moral power on earth, through the Concordat, expressed its confidence in the new German government. This was a deed of immeasurable significance for the reputation of the new government abroad.
===The concordat===
The Treaty with Additional Protocol [in brackets] was signed 20 July 1933. It was ratified and in force starting 10 September 1933 and remains in force. The text of the concordat was released 22 July 1933 and began with a preamble that set out the common desire of both parties for friendly relations set-out in a solemn agreement.

Preamble

His Holiness Pope Pius XI and the President of the German Reich [&quot;Paul von Hindenburg&quot;], led by their common desire to consolidate and enhance the existing friendly relations between the Catholic Church and the state in the whole territory of the German Reich in a stable and satisfactory manner for both parties, have decided to conclude a solemn agreement which will supplement the concordats already concluded with some particular German States (Laender) and secure for the others the principles of a uniform treatment of the questions involved.

His Holiness Pope Pius XI has appointed as his plenipotentiary [&quot;a diplomat granted full power to represent&quot;] His Eminence the Most Revered Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, His Holiness&#x27; Secretary of State; and the President of the German Reich [&quot;Paul von Hindenburg&quot;] has appointed as plenipotentiary the Vice-Chairman of the German Reich, Herr Franz von Papen; who, having exchanged their proper form have agreed to the following articles.

Additional Protocol {in brackets}

When the signing of the concordat concluded today between the Holy See and the German Reich, the undersigned, being duly empowered to do so, have formulated the following explanations which form an integral part of the concordat itself.

* Article 1 The German Reich guarantees freedom of profession and public practice of the Catholic religion. It recognizes the right of the Catholic Church to regulate and manage her own affairs independently within the limits of the law applicable to all and to issue – within the framework of her own competence – laws and ordinances binding on her members.

The vagueness of the article would later lead to contradictory interpretations.

* Article 2 The concordats concluded with Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929) and Baden (1932) and the rights and privileges of the Catholic Church recognized therein remain unchanged within the territory of the States (Laender) concerned. For the rest of the states provisions of the present concordat shall be fully applicable. These provisions shall also be binding for the said three states in so far as they are relative to matters not regulated by the concordats concluded with those states, or in so far as they complete the arrangements already made.

Affirms the state concordats, Länderkonkordate, with Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929), and Baden (1932) remain valid.

* Article 3 In order to foster good relations between the Holy See and the German Reich, an apostolic nuncio will continue to reside, as hitherto, in the capital of the German Reich and an ambassador of the German Reich will reside with the Holy See. (With regard to Art. 3. In accordance to the exchange between the apostolic nunciature and the Reich foreign office on the 11 and 12 March respectively, the apostolic nuncio to the German Reich shall be the dean of the diplomatic corps accredited in Berlin.)

Confirms the Vatican having a Papal Nuncio (diplomat) in Berlin and the German government having an ambassador in Rome.

* Article 4 The Holy See shall enjoy full freedom in its contact and correspondence with the bishops, clergy and all other members of the Catholic Church in Germany. The same applies to the bishops and other diocesan authorities in their contact with the faithful in all matters of their pastoral office. Instructions, ordinances, pastoral letters, official diocesan gazettes and other enactments concerning the spiritual guidance of the faithful, issued by the ecclesiastical authorities within the framework of their competence, may be published without hindrance and made known to the faithful in the ways heretofore usual.

Article 4 assures the Holy See of full freedom to communicate with the German clergy and for the German bishops to communicate with the laity &quot;in all matters of their pastoral office.&quot; The words of qualification in this clause would later be interpreted by the Nazis in its most narrow meaning to limit the Church communications to worship and ritual only.

* Article 5 The clergy enjoy in the discharge of their spiritual activities the same protection of the state as state officials. The state will proceed according to general provisions of its law in case of any outrage directed against any clergy personally or against their ecclesiastical character or in case of any interference with duties of their office and, if necessary, will provide official protection.
* Article 6 Clerics and religious are exempt from the obligation to undertake public offices and such obligations as are incompatible with their clerical or religious status. This applies particularly to the office of magistrate, member of a jury in law courts, membership of taxation committees or membership of the fiscal tribunal.
* Article 7 A member of the clergy can accept an official function or appointment in the state or in any publicly constituted corporation dependent on the state only after having received the &quot;nihil obstat&quot; of his diocesan ordinary [&quot;bishop&quot;], as well as that of the ordinary competent for the place where the seat of the corporation is situated. For important reasons in which the interests of the Church are involved, the &quot;nihil obstat&quot; can be withdrawn at any time.
* Article 8 The official income of the clergy is exempt from distraint to the same extent as the official salary of the civil servants of the Reich and of the states.
* Article 9 The judicial and other authorities cannot ask the clergy to give information about matters which have been entrusted to them while exercising the care of souls and which are consequently covered by the obligation of pastoral secrecy.
* Article 10 The wearing of clerical dress or of a religious habit by lay persons or by clerics or religious who have been forbidden to wear it on the strength of a final and valid decision of the competent Church authority – officially communicated to the state authorities – shall be punished by the state with the same penalties as the misuse of a military uniform.

Articles 5–10 dealt with the status of the clergy under German law. Priests were given protection against any interference in their spiritual activities as well as protection against malicious slander or misuse of clerical dress. Exemption from jury service, and like obligations, was guaranteed and the secrecy of the confessional guaranteed. Members of the clergy could only accept a state appointment so long as the bishop approved and this permission could be withdrawn at any time for important reasons.

* Article 11 The present organization and delimitation (&quot;boundaries)&quot; of the Roman Catholic dioceses in the German Reich remains at it is. If, however, the rearrangement of a bishopric or of an ecclesiastical province, or any other changes in the delimitation of diocese appear necessary in the future, they will be subject to agreement with the government of the state concerned in case that they involve changes only with boundaries of one German state (Land). In case of rearrangement of changes which exceed the boundaries of one German state, the agreement is to be made with the Reich government, to whose care it shall be left secure the consent of the state governments in question. The same applies to the establishment of new ecclesiastical provinces or alterations therein if these involve several German states. The foregoing provisions are not applicable to the shifting of boundaries which is made only with regard to the local care of souls. In case of a wider reorganization within the German reich, the Reich government shall consult with the Holy See with a view to such regrouping of dioceses and to their delimitation.
* Article 12 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 11, ecclesiastical offices can be freely established and altered if no subsidy is asked for from the state funds. The co-operation of the state in establishing and changing the parish communities shall proceed according to the rules which have been arranged with the diocesan bishops; the Reich government will endeavor to achieve a uniform formulation by the state governments of their rules as far as possible.

Articles 11–12 specified that diocesan boundaries had to be made subject to government approval and that ecclesiastical offices could be established if no state funding was involved.

* Article 13 Catholic parishes and diocesan associations, episcopal sees, bishoprics and chapters, religious orders and congregations, as well as institutions, foundations and property of the Catholic Church administered by ecclesiastical authorities, shall retain or acquire respectively juridical personality, recognized by the State according to the general provisions of civil law. They shall remain publicly recognized corporations as far as they have been such hitherto; the same rights may be granted to the others in accordance with the general law applicable to all. (With regard to Art. 13. It is understood that the right of the Church to levy taxes is guaranteed.)

Article 13 gave to parishes, Episcopal sees, religious orders, etc. juridical personality and granted the same rights as any other publicly recognised body &quot;in accordance with the general law as applicable to all&quot; which subjected the church&#x27;s prerogatives to legal regulation under civil law. Guenter Lewy viewed this qualification as establishing &quot;a pandora&#x27;s box of troubles&quot; when the law was effectively in the hands of a regime who wanted to control the church.

* Article 14 As a rule, the Church has the right to appoint freely to all the Church dignities and benefices without any co-operation on the part of the state or of the civil corporations, unless any other arrangement has been made in previous concordats mentioned in Article 2. As for the appointment to the metropolitan see of Freiburg, in the diocese of the Upper Rhine, it shall be applicable to the two suffragan [&quot;subordinate&quot;] bishoprics of Rottenburg and Mainz, as well as to the bishoprics of Meissen. The same applies in the said two suffragan bishoprics as regards the appointments to the cathedral chapters and the settlement of the rights of patronage. Furthermore, agreement has been reached on the following points. (i) Catholic clerics who enjoy a spiritual office in Germany or exercise there a pastoral or educational activity, must: (a) be German citizens; (b) have obtained a school certificate (certificate of maturity) entitling them to study at a higher German school; (c) have studied philosophy and theology for at least three years at a German state university, an academic ecclesiastical college in Germany, or a papal high school in Rome. (ii) The Bulls containing appointments of archbishops, bishops, coadjutors &quot;cum iure successionis&quot; (right of succession) or of a &quot;prelatus nullis&quot; (a bishop who has jurisdiction independent of a diocese) will not be issued before the name of the selected has been communicated to the Reichsstatthalter in the State (Land) in question, and before it has been ascertained that there are no objections of a general political nature against such a person. The conditions laid down above (i) par (a), (b), (c), can be discarded by mutual agreement between Church and state. (With regard to Art. 14, par. 2, sect. 2. It is understood that if objections of a general political nature exist, they shall be presented as soon as possible. Should they not be presented within twenty days, the Holy See will be entitled to believe there are no objections against the candidate in question. Before an official announcement of the appointment is made, secrecy shall be kept about the candidates concerned. This article does not establish for the state a right to veto.)

Article 14 specified appointments of a bishop by the Pope was subject to mutual agreement and communication with the regime that no [general] political impediment existed, while affirming appointments may be made without any co-operation on the part of the state or civil corporations.

* Article 15 Religious orders and congregations are not subject, on the part of the state, to any particular restrictions as far as their foundation, their various establishments, the number of their members and their qualifications (save, however, for the previsions of art. 15 par. 2), their pastoral or educational activity, their care of the sick and charitable work, the management of their affairs and the administration of their property are concerned. Superiors of religious orders who have their official residence within the German Reich must have German citizenship. Provincials and superiors whose official residence is situated outside the German territory have the right of visitation of their establishments in Germany, even if they have a foreign citizenship. The Holy See will see to it that the organization of the provinces of various religious orders, as regards their establishments in Germany, should be such as to avoid – so far as it can be done – the subordination of German establishments to foreign provincials. Exceptions therefrom may be admitted by mutual agreement with the Reich government, particularly in cases where the small number of establishments in Germany makes the formation of German province impracticable or where special reasons exist for the maintenance of a provincial organization rooted in history and working well in practice.

Article 15 guaranteed religious orders freedom for pastoral, charitable and educational work.

* Article 16 Before taking possession of their diocese, the &quot;bishops&quot; shall take an oath of loyalty either between the hands of the Reichsstatthalter in the state (Land) in question or between those of the president of the Reich, the formula of which shall be the following: &quot;Before God and on the Holy Gospel I swear and promise, as becomes a bishop, loyalty to the German &quot;Reich&quot; and to the Land of (name of Land)&quot;.&quot; I swear and promise to respect the government established according to the constitution and to cause the clergy of my diocese to respect it. In due solicitude for the welfare and the interests of the German Reich, I will endeavor, while performing the spiritual office bestowed upon me, to prevent anything which might threaten to be detrimental to it.&quot;

Article 16 specified Bishops must take an oath of loyalty and respect to either the &quot;Reich&quot; governor of the state concerned or to the President of the Reich as established by the constitution. When the treaty was signed and ratified the word &quot;Reich&quot;, or the phrase, German Reich, is not in reference to the so-called &quot;Third &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;. It applies to the period of the Weimar Republic which did not officially and fully collapse until the death of President Paul von Hindenburg 2 August 1934 with the passing of a national referendum vote 19 August 1934 consolidating the Office of Chancellor and President, thereby, declaring Adolf Hitler &quot;Führer&quot; of Germany.

* Article 17 The property and all other proprietary rights of the publicly recognized corporations, institutions, foundations and associations of the Catholic Church will be guaranteed according to the common law of the state. No building used for public worship can be demolished under any pretext or for any reason whatsoever, except if a mutual agreement has been reached beforehand with the competent ecclesiastical authority. (With regard to Art. 17. In so far as building or land belonging to the state have been devoted to ecclesiastical purposes, they will continue to be devoted to them, with due regard, however, to the contracts which might have been concluded about them.)

Article 17 guaranteed, according to the common law, the properties of the church.

* Article 18 Should the state payments in kind or money, which are made to the Catholic Church, whether based on law, contract, or any other special legal title, be discontinued, the Holy See and the Reich will proceed in due time beforehand to set up amicable agreement the principles according to which the discontinuation is to be carried out. In this connection, a right derived from a legitimate traditional custom is to be considered as a special legal title. Such discontinuation, implying the cessation of a state payment or obligation, must be adequately compensated in favor of the claimant.

Article 18 assured the Church that it would be consulted should the Nazi regime (&quot;or existing government)&quot; try to discontinue its subsidies to the German Catholic church or other legal title without compensation as specified in Article 138 of the Weimar Constitution for all religious organizations.

* Article 19 Catholic theological faculties in state universities shall be maintained. Their relationship to the Church authorities will be regulated by the provisions of the respective concordats and by the protocols annexed to them, with due regard to the ecclesiastical laws relative to these faculties. The Reich will endeavor to secure for all German Catholic faculties in question a uniform regime in accordance with the general spirit of the regulations concerned. (With regard to Art. 19, sent. 2. The basis referred to consists, at the time when this concordat is being concluded, especially of the Apostolic Constitution &quot;Deus scienitarum dominus&quot; 24 May 1931, and the Instruction of 7 May July 1932.)
* Article 20 The Church has the right, unless there is some other agreement, to establish theological and philosophical colleges for the training of clergy; if no state subsidies are claimed for these institutions, they will be dependent solely on the ecclesiastical authorities. The establishment, management and administration of seminaries and hostels for clerical students pertains exclusively, within the limits of the law applicable to all, to ecclesiastical authorities. (With regard to Art. 20. Hostels connected with high and secondary schools and administered by the Church will be recognized, from the taxation stand-point, as being in practice ecclesiastical institutions in the proper sense of the word, and as of diocesan origin.)
* Article 21 Catholic religious instruction in primary, vocational, secondary and higher schools is a regular subject of tuition and is to be taught in accordance with the principles of the Catholic Church. In religious instruction the patriotic, civic and social consciousness and sense of duty will be particularly stressed and cultivated, as this is generally done in the school training. The teaching program of religious education and the selection of text books will be settled with by agreement with the higher ecclesiastical authorities. These authorities will be given the opportunity to control, in harmony with the school authorities, whether pupils are receiving religious instruction in accordance with the teaching and requirements of the Church.
* Article 22 Mutual agreements shall be arrived at between the bishops and the governments of German states (Laender) with regard to the appointment of the teachers of religion. Teachers who have been declared by the bishop unfit for the further exercise of their teaching function, either for pedagogical reasons or on account of their moral behavior, must not be employed as teachers of religion as long as the obstacle remains.
* Article 23 The maintenance of the existing Catholic confessional schools and the establishment of new ones is hereby guaranteed. In all localities where parents or guardians request it, Catholic primary schools will be established if the number of their prospective pupils, considered from the point of view of the local school conditions, appears to be sufficient for the establishment of a school corresponding to the standards prescribed by the state legislation.
*Article 24 Only members of the Catholic Church who can be trusted that they will correspond to the special requirements of a Catholic confessional school, can be employed as teachers in all Catholic primary schools. Within the framework of the professional training of teachers, arrangements will be made to guarantee the education and training of Catholic teachers capable of fulfilling the special requirements of Catholic confessional schools. (With regard to Art. 24. In so far as private institutions are able to satisfy, after the new regulations regarding the education of teachers, the general applicable requirements of the state, the existing establishments of religious orders and congregations will be given due consideration in the accordance of recognition.)
* Article 25 Religious orders and congregations have the right to establish and run private schools within the limits of the general legislation and conditions laid down by the law. The same qualifications as in state schools can be acquired in these private schools if they follow the teaching program prescribed for state schools. Members of religious orders and congregations are subject, with regard to their employment in private schools, to the general conditions applicable to all.

Articles 19–25 gave protection to the Catholic educational system (Hitler in due course would disregard them).

* Article 26 Pending a later and more detailed settlement of matters regarding matrimonial law, it is understood that a church wedding may precede the civil marriage ceremony not only in the case of a grave illness of one of the fiancés which does not permit any delay, but in the case of great moral emergency (which, however, must be confirmed by the competent episcopal authority). In such cases, the parish priest is bound to report the matter at once to the registrar&#x27;s office. (With regard to Art. 26. It is considered to be a great moral emergency if the timely procuring of documents necessary for the wedding meets with obstacles which are either insuperable or whose removal would be disproportionately costly.)

Article 26 allowed that a church wedding could precede a civil marriage ceremony in certain cases.

* Article 27 A special and exempt pastoral ministry is conceded to the officers, employees, and men of the Germany army and to their families. An army bishop will be in charge of this pastoral care. His ecclesiastical appointment will be effected by the Holy See after contact has been made with the Reich government to select, by mutual agreement, a suitable candidate. The ecclesiastical appointment of the military chaplains and other military clergy will be made by the military bishop after previous consultation with the competent authorities of the Reich. The army bishop can, however, appoint as military chaplains only such priests who have obtained, from their ordinary, permission to engage in military pastoral work and who have obtained an appropriate certificate of fitness. Military chaplains have the rights of parish priests with regard to the troops and other army personnel assigned to their care. An apostolic brief will be issued to regulate in detail the Catholic care of souls in the army. Regulations about the position of army chaplains as state officials will be issued by the Reich government. (With regard to Art. 27, sent. 2. Catholic army officers, personnel and men, as well as their families, do not belong to the local parish communities and are not to contribute to their maintenance. With regard to sent. 4. The apostolic brief will be issued in agreement with the Reich government.)

Article 27 regulated the appointment of military chaplains.

* Article 28 The Church will be admitted to pastoral visits and to the holding of divine service in hospitals, prisons, and similar public institutions. If a regular care of souls, requiring appointment of clergy as state or public officials, is introduced in such institutions, this will be made by agreement with the higher Church authorities.

Article 28 assured the Church the right to pastoral care in hospitals, prisons and like institutions, which would be violated later by the Nazi regime when it refused the Church&#x27;s request to carry out services in concentration camps.

* Article 29 Catholic members of non-German national minorities living within the Reich will not be placed in a worse status with regard to the use of their mother tongue in divine service, religious instruction and Church societies, than is the corresponding legal and practical position of the population of German origin and speech living in the territory of the corresponding foreign state. (With regard to Art. 29. Since the Reich government has shown itself ready to make concessions with regard to non-German minorities, the Holy See declares – confirming hereby the principles which it has constantly maintained regarding the right of using the vernacular in the pastoral ministry, religious instruction and in the activities of Catholic associations – that it will keep in mind, when concluding future concordats with other countries, the inclusion in them of provisions of a similar value for the rights of German minorities there.)

Article 29 granted the same rights to national minorities, with respect to the use of the mother tongue in divine services, as were enjoyed by the German population in the corresponding foreign state.

* Article 30 On Sundays and Holy Days a prayer will be said for the welfare of the German Reich and its people in episcopal, parish, affiliated and conventional churches in the German Reich, immediately after the High Mass and according to the rules of the Church liturgy.
* Article 31 Catholic organizations and associations whose activity is devoted exclusively to religious, purely cultural and charitable purposes and which are, as such, subordinated to Church authorities, are protected as to their institution and activities. Catholic organizations which, apart from religious cultural or charitable purposes, have other tasks such as social or professional aims, shall also enjoy the protection of this article 31, paragraph 1, even though their organization may be disposed in associations corresponding to states (Laender), provided they guarantee to develop their activities outside political parties. It is reserved to the Reich government and the German episcopate (bishops) to determine by mutual agreement the organizations and associations which fall within the provisions of this article. (With regard to Art. 31, par.4. The principles laid down in par. 4 of this article are equally valid for the labor service.)
* Article 32 With regard to the special conditions existing in Germany and with regard to the provisions of the present concordat guaranteeing legislation to protect the rights and privileges of the Catholic Church in the Reich and its states (Laender), the Holy See will issue ordinances by which the clergy and the religious will be forbidden to be members of political parties or to be active on their behalf. (With regard to Art. 32. It is understood that the same provisions, regarding activity in political parties, will be enacted by the Reich for the non-Catholic confessions. The conduct which has been stipulated as a duty for the German clergy and members of religious in Art. 32 does not mean any restriction on their preaching and exposition of the dogmatic and moral teachings and principles of the Church, as it is their duty to do.)

Articles 31–32 relate to the issue of Catholic organizations &quot;devoted exclusively to religious, cultural and charitable purposes&quot; and empowered the Reich government and German episcopate to &quot;determine, by mutual agreement, the organizations and associations which fall within the provisions of this article.&quot; Organizations (sponsored by the Catholic Church) that had any political aims no longer had any place in the new Germany; this went without saying and is not even mentioned. Article 32 gave to Hitler one of his principal objectives: the exclusion of the clergy from politics such that &quot;the Holy See will issue ordinances by which the clergy and the religious will be forbidden to be members of political parties or to be active on their behalf.&quot; Catholic laity, however, were free to form, engage and propagate political parties and seek political office. The Additional Protocol provisions make clear this prohibition of clergy from political activism does not mean they can not preach on moral teachings and principles of the Church &quot;as it is their duty to do.&quot;

* Article 33 All matters regarding clerical persons or Church affairs which have not been mentioned in the preceding articles will be settled, for the sphere of the Church, according to canon law in force. Should a divergence arise, in the future, as to the interpretation or application of any provisions of this concordat, the Holy See and the German Reich will arrive at an amicable solution by mutual agreement.
* Article 34 This Concordat, whose German and Italian texts shall have equal binding force, shall be ratified and the certificates of ratification shall be exchanged as soon as possible. It will be enforced from the day of exchange. In witness hereof the plenipotentiaries (representatives) have signed this Concordat. Signed in the two original exemplars, in the Vatican City, 30 July 1933. Signed: Eugenio, Cardinal Pacelli. Signed: Franz von Papen.

Article 33 makes provision for settling any difficulties in interpretation of the concordat through &quot;amicable solution by mutual agreement.&quot; Article 34 calls for the speedy ratification of the concordat. As the document states, It was not in force until its ratification 10 September 1933.

An additional secret protocol was added at its signing. When the concordat was ratified 10 September 1933 it granted Catholic clergy certain exemptions from any future universal army conscription call-ups. As Article 27 states, &quot;A special and exempt ministry is conceded.&quot; As the Treaty of Versailles had forbidden Germany from raising a large army, this provision may have been seen by Hitler as the Vatican giving its tacit approval to German rearmament. Papen wrote to Hitler regarding this secret provision and concluded his brief with, &quot;I hope this agreement will therefore be pleasing to you.&quot; The provisions of the annexe were inserted at the request of the German Bishops Fulda Conference and the contents were kept so secret that Ernst von Weizsacker, State Secretary in the Foreign Ministry from 1938, did not know of it until informed by the Papal Nuncio Orsenigo in 1939.

===Reception===
While the highest authorities of the Catholic Church in the Vatican liked the agreement, most of the bishops and common clergy saw it negatively; this was especially true in Germany where most bishops and priests disapproved of National Socialism and thus received the news coldly; for example, most refused to even hold a Te Deum service to celebrate its approval.

Catholic clergy outside Germany mostly rejected the concordat as well; for instance the British Roman Catholic periodical &quot;The Tablet&quot; openly reported the signing of the concordat negatively:

Already it is being said that THE POPE OF ROME thinks of nobody save his own adherents and that he does not care how Lutherans are dragooned and how Jews are harried so long as Popish bishops, monastic orders, confessional schools, and Catholic associations are allowed full freedom. We beg our Protestant and Jewish friends to put away such suspicions. As we suggested at the outset of this brief article, the Catholic Church could have done little for other denominations in Germany if she had begun thrusting out wild hands to help them while her own feet were slipping under her. By patience and reasonableness she has succeeded in re-establishing herself, more firmly than before, on a Concordat which does not surrender one feather&#x27;s weight of essential Catholic principle. She will straightway set about her sacred task, an important part of which will be the casting out of those devils which have been raging – and are raging still – in the Reich. But &quot;this sort&quot; of devil is not cast out save by prayer. Political action (from which the German clergy are debarred under the Concordat) by the Church would drive matters from bad to worse. We are confident, however, that Catholics will abhor the idea of enjoying complete toleration while Protestants and Jews are under the harrow, and that, quietly but strongly, the Catholic influence will be exerted in the right direction. One German out of three is a Catholic; and Catholic prestige is high in Germany&#x27;s public life.

Criticism of the concordat was initially from those countries who viewed Germany as a potential threat. &quot;Le Temps&quot; wrote: &quot;This is a triumph for the National Socialist government. It took Mussolini five years to achieve this; Germany has done it in a week.&quot; &quot;L&#x27;Ere Nouvelle&quot; wrote: &quot;The contradiction of a system preaching universalism making an agreement with a highly nationalistic state has been repeated throughout Vatican history. The Church never attacks existing institutions, even if they are bad. It prefers to wait for their collapse, hoping for the emergence of a higher morality. The Polish newspaper &quot;Kurjer Poranny&quot; wrote on 19 July 1933: &quot;Once again we see the methods of the Vatican – intransigent with the passive and amenable, but accommodating with the high-handed and ruthless. In the last century it rewarded its persecutor, Bismarck, with the highest Papal decoration, the Order of Christ. ...The Centre Party, which most courageously resisted the Nazis, has been disowned by the Vatican.&quot; Ex-Chancellor Bruning reported that 300 Protestant pastors who had been on the verge of joining the Catholic Church on account of the stand it had taken against the Nazis abandoned the plan after the signing of the concordat. On 24 July, the Nazi newspaper &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; commented:

The provocative agitation which for years was conducted against the NSDAP because of its alleged hostility to religion has now been refuted by the Church itself. This fact signifies a tremendous moral strengthening of the National Socialist government of the Reich and its reputation.

On 26 and 27 July 1933, the Vatican daily newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; stressed the advantages gained by the church through the concordat but also said that the church had not given up her traditional neutrality towards different forms of political government nor did it endorse a &quot;specific trend of political doctrines or ideas.&quot; The Nazis replied through the German press on 30 July by correcting perceived false interpretations of the concordat and &quot;reminding the Vatican&quot; that the concordat had been signed with the German Reich which &quot;as Rome should know, is completely dominated by the National Socialist trend&quot; and therefore &quot;the &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; recognition of the National Socialist government&quot; was signaled by the concordat. The Vatican demanded that the German government dissociate itself from these remarks but agreed eventually to forget its complaints so long as the German press refrained from any further &quot;harping on the great victory&quot; achieved by Nazi Germany.

===Violations===
Nazi violations of the concordat commenced almost immediately after it was signed. The Nazis claimed jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, interfering with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers&#x27; clubs and cultural societies. Hitler had a &quot;blatant disregard&quot; for the concordat, wrote Paul O&#x27;Shea, and its signing was to him merely a first step in the &quot;gradual suppression of the Catholic Church in Germany&quot;. Anton Gill wrote that &quot;with his usual irresistible, bullying technique, Hitler then proceeded to take a mile where he had been given an inch&quot; and closed all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious:

Within the same month of signing the concordat, the Nazis promulgated their sterilization law – the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring – a policy the Catholic Church considered deeply offensive. Days later, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, religious sisters, and lay leaders began to be targeted with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or immorality. Priests were watched closely and frequently denounced, arrested and sent to concentration camps. From 1940, a dedicated Clergy Barracks had been established at Dachau concentration camp. Intimidation of clergy was widespread. Cardinal Faulhaber was shot at. Cardinal Innitzer had his Vienna residence ransacked in October 1938, and Bishop Sproll of Rottenburg was jostled and his home vandalised.

William Shirer wrote that the German people were not greatly aroused by the persecution of the churches by the Nazi Government. The majority were not moved to face death or imprisonment for the sake of freedom of worship, being too impressed by Hitler&#x27;s early foreign policy successes and the restoration of the German economy. Few, he wrote, &quot;paused to reflect that the Nazi regime intended to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods and the new paganism of the Nazi extremists.&quot;

Anti-Nazi sentiment grew in Catholic circles as the Nazi government increased its repressive measures against their activities. In his history of the German Resistance, Hoffmann writes that, from the beginning:

After constant confrontations, by late 1935, Bishop Clemens August von Galen of Münster was urging a joint pastoral letter protesting against an &quot;underground war&quot; against the church. By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with the new government, had become highly disillusioned. In March, Pope Pius XI issued the &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; encyclical – accusing the Nazi Government of violations of the 1933 concordat, and further that it was sowing the &quot;tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church&quot;. The Nazis responded with an intensification of the Church Struggle, beginning around April.

When the Nazi government violated the concordat (in particular Article 31), the bishops and the Papacy protested against these violations. Pius XI considered terminating the concordat, but his secretary of state and members of the curia, who feared the impact upon German Catholics, dissuaded him, as they believed it would result in the loss of a protective shield. Cardinal Pacelli acknowledged his role in its retention after the war.

The flourishing Catholic press of Germany faced censorship and closure. Finally in March 1941, Goebbels banned all Church press, on the pretext of a &quot;paper shortage&quot;. Catholic schools were a major battleground in the kirchenkampf campaign against the Church. When in 1933 the Nazi school superintendent of Münster issued a decree that religious instruction be combined with discussion of the &quot;demoralising power&quot; of the &quot;people of Israel&quot;, Bishop Clemens August Graf von Galen of Münster refused, writing that such interference in curriculum was a breach of the concordat and that he feared children would be confused as to their &quot;obligation to act with charity to all men&quot; and as to the historical mission of the people of Israel. Galen protested directly to Hitler over violations of the concordat. When in 1936, Nazis removed crucifixes in schools, protest by Galen led to public demonstrations. Church kindergartens were closed, crucifixes were removed from schools and Catholic welfare programs were restricted on the basis they assisted the &quot;racially unfit&quot;. Parents were coerced into removing their children from Catholic schools. In Bavaria, teaching positions allotted to sisters were awarded to secular teachers and denominational schools were transformed into &quot;community schools&quot;. When in 1937 the authorities in Upper Bavaria attempted to replace Catholic schools with &quot;common schools&quot;, Cardinal Faulhaber offered fierce resistance. By 1939 all Catholic denominational schools had been disbanded or converted to public facilities.

===World War II===
From 1940, the Gestapo launched an intense persecution of the monasteries, invading, searching and appropriating them. The Provincial of the Dominican Province of Teutonia, Laurentius Siemer, a spiritual leader of the German Resistance, was influential in the Committee for Matters Relating to the Orders, which formed in response to Nazi attacks against Catholic monasteries and aimed to encourage the bishops to intercede on behalf of the Orders and oppose the Nazi state more emphatically.

In 1941, an expansion of the regime&#x27;s attack ont the churches grew as did the war in the East. Monasteries and convents were targeted and expropriation of Church properties surged. The Nazi authorities said that the properties were needed for wartime necessities such as hospitals, or accommodation for refugees or children, but in fact used them for their own purposes. &quot;Hostility to the state&quot; was another common cause given for the confiscations, and the action of a single member of a monastery could result in seizure of the whole. The Jesuits were especially targeted. The Papal Nuncio Cesare Orsenigo and Cardinal Bertram complained constantly to the authorities but were told to expect more requisitions owing to war-time needs.

Figures like Bishops Clemens August Graf von Galen and Konrad von Preysing attempted to protect German priests from arrest. In Galen&#x27;s 1941 anti-euthanasia sermons, he denounced the confiscations of church properties. He attacked the Gestapo for converting church properties to their own purposes – including use as cinemas and brothels. He protested against the mistreatment of Catholics in Germany: the arrests and imprisonment without legal process, the suppression of the monasteries, and the expulsion of religious orders.

On 22 March 1942, the German Bishops issued a pastoral letter on &quot;The Struggle against Christianity and the Church&quot;. The letter launched a defence of human rights and the rule of law and accused the Reich Government of &quot;unjust oppression and hated struggle against Christianity and the Church&quot;, despite the loyalty of German Catholics to the Fatherland, and brave service of Catholic soldiers:

In July 1942, Hitler said he viewed the concordat as obsolete, and intended to abolish it after the war, and only hesitated to withdraw Germany&#x27;s representative from the Vatican out of &quot;military reasons connected with the war&quot;:
In fact the Operation Anthropoid commandos were besieged in the Orthodox Saints Cyril and Methodius Cathedral.

==After World War II==
Pius XII put a high priority on preserving the concordat from the Nazi era, although the bishops were unenthusiastic about it and the Allies considered the request inappropriate. After the war, the concordat remained in place and the Catholic Church was restored to its previous position.

When Lower Saxony passed a new school law, the Holy See complained that it violated the terms of the concordat. The federal government called upon the Federal Constitutional Court () for clarification. In its ruling of 26 March 1957, the court decided that the circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the concordat did not invalidate it.

Declaring its lack of jurisdiction in matters of public international law and considering the fact that the German constitution grants authority in school matters to the state governments, the Constitutional Court ruled that the federal government had no authority to intervene. So while the federal government was obligated by the concordat, the court could not enforce its application in all areas because said court lacks legal authority to do so.

Critics also say that the concordat undermined the separation of church and state. The Weimar constitution (some of whose regulations, namely articles 136–139 and 141 were re-enacted in article 140 of the current German constitution) does not speak of a separation, but rather rules out any state religion while protecting religious freedom, religious holidays and leaving open the possibility of cooperation. However, a conflict continued between article 18 of the concordat and article 138 of the Weimar constitution.

==Assessment==
Anthony Rhodes regarded Hitler&#x27;s desire for a concordat with the Vatican as being driven principally by the prestige and respectability it brought to his regime abroad while at the same time eliminating the opposition of the Centre Party. Rhodes took the view that if the survival of Catholic education and youth organisations was taken to be the principal aim of papal diplomacy during this period then the signing of the concordat to prevent greater evils was justified. Many of the Centre Party deputies were priests who had not been afraid to raise their voices and would almost certainly have voted against Hitler&#x27;s assumption of dictatorial powers. The voluntary dissolution of the Centre Party removed that obstacle and Hitler had absolute power and brought respectability to the state: &quot;Within six months of its birth, the Third Reich had been given full approval by the highest spiritual power on earth&quot;. Ian Kershaw considered the role of the Centre Party in Hitler&#x27;s removal of almost all constitutional restraints as &quot;particularly ignominious.&quot;

John Cornwell views Cardinal Pacelli as being an example of a &quot;fellow traveller&quot; of the Nazis who, through the concordat, was willing to accept the generosity of Hitler in the educational sphere (more schools, teachers and student slots), so long as the Church withdrew from the social and political sphere, at the same time as Jews were being dismissed from universities and Jewish student slots were being reduced. He argues that the Catholic Centre Party vote was decisive in the adoption of dictatorial powers by Hitler and that the party&#x27;s subsequent dissolution was at Pacelli&#x27;s prompting. Michael Phayer is of the opinion that a muted response to the attacks on Mosaic Jews was due to the concordat conditioned German bishops to avoid speaking out against anything that was not strictly related to church matters. Carlo Falconi described the concordat as &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Pact with Hitler&quot;. Albert Einstein in private conversation relating to the concordat said &quot;Since when can one make a pact with Christ and Satan at the same time?&quot; Daniel Goldhagen recalled how Hitler had said: &quot;To attain our aim we should stop at nothing even if we must join forces with the devil,&quot; and that, in Goldhagen&#x27;s view, is what Hitler did in agreeing the concordat with the church. Gordon Zahn felt that though the signing of the concordat was distasteful for Cardinal Pacelli it had spared the church in Germany from greater hardship and persecution.

<text>A campaign setting is a setting for a tabletop role-playing game or wargame campaign. Most campaign settings are fictional worlds; however, some are historical or contemporary real-world locations. A &quot;campaign&quot; is a series of individual adventures, and a &quot;campaign setting&quot; is the world in which such adventures and campaigns take place. A campaign setting is typically designed for a specific game (such as the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;) or a specific genre of game (such as historical fantasy or science fiction), though some come from existing media (such as movies, shows, novels, or comic books). There are numerous campaign settings available for purchase both in print and online. In addition, many game masters create their own, which are often called &quot;homebrew&quot; settings.

Examples of major campaign settings include the Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign settings, World of Darkness, the Star Trek science fiction universe, and the fantasy world.

==Types of setting==

Some games and settings only appear together, such as &quot;Warhammer.&quot; Some games have multiple settings, such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; or generic roleplaying systems such as &quot;GURPS&quot; or &quot;Fudge.&quot; There are also stand-alone settings that can be used for multiple game systems. Often these are developed first for works of fiction, such as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe or &quot;Middle-earth,&quot; then later adapted to one or more role playing systems. However, some system-agnostic settings are designed explicitly for gaming, such as Hârn.

Games scholar Nikolai Butler distinguished two types of campaign settings, homebrewed and official. According to games journalist David M. Ewalt, established campaign settings have the advantage of providing a wealth of material written by professional game designers. When creating a homebrew setting &quot;you&#x27;re on your own - but without limits and preconceptions&quot;, which can lead to more interesting games as the game master may be &quot;more invested in the material and passionate about its development&quot;.

== Early history of genres (1970s-1990s) ==
===Fantasy===

The first role-playing settings from the early 1970s (such as &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; and &quot;Blackmoor&quot;) were based on works in the fantasy literary genre by authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. As a result, common fantasy elements in campaign settings include magic and supernatural/mythological creatures, such as dragons, elves, dwarves and orcs. The worlds in these games usually have a level of technology similar to that of medieval Europe. Over the decades since, fantasy role-playing has evolved and expanded tremendously, developing sub-genres such as dark fantasy, high fantasy, and science fantasy.

Games such as &quot;Ars Magica&quot; popularized fantasy set within elements of real-world history. Subsequent games updated this concept further, bringing fantasy gaming into the present day with urban fantasy (such as &quot;&quot;) or into the future with cyberpunk (e.g. &quot;Shadowrun&quot;).

===Science fiction===

Science fiction settings typically take place in the future. Common elements involve futuristic technology, contact with alien life forms, experimental societies, and space travel. Psionic abilities (i.e. ESP and telekinesis) often take the place of magic. Similar to science fiction literature and film, the game genre contains sub-genres such as cyberpunk, space opera, and steampunk.

Science fiction settings for role playing were introduced with &quot;Metamorphosis Alpha&quot; in 1976—dungeon adventuring on a &quot;lost starship&quot;—and in 1977 soon followed with &quot;Traveller&quot;, a space opera game. Its &quot;Third Imperium&quot; setting covered multiple worlds and alien races. &quot;Gamma World&quot;, introduced in 1978, explored the replacement of traditional elements of fantasy settings with the pseudo-scientific elements of post-apocalyptic fiction. Due to the success of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and the franchise&#x27;s impact on popular culture, many science fiction settings were introduced or adapted during the 1980s. Such settings often involved detailed accounts of military and/or trading operations and organizations.

===Historical===

Historical games are set in the past of Earth. Historical settings explored in 1980s-1990s roleplaying games include Pendragon (Arthurian), Sengoku (Japanese warring states), Recon (Vietnam War), and (historical Tibet).

===Horror===

Horror settings such as &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; were first introduced in the early 1980s, creating a hybrid of fantasy horror and modern thrillers. These settings tended to focus on organizations and societies in which generally normal people fight against malevolent supernatural entities. Another style of horror game reversed the roles, with player characters acting as supernatural creatures, such as vampires and werewolves. This style was popularized in the 1990s by White Wolf&#x27;s and World of Darkness. Early campaign settings that combine horror and fantasy elements include the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; settings &quot;Ravenloft&quot; and &quot;Ghostwalk&quot;. The D&amp;D &quot;Heroes of Horror&quot; sourcebook also provided ways to emphasize horror elements within a more typical fantasy milieu.

<doc id="435384" wikidata="Q575934" url="?curid=435384" title="Deep Space 2">
<text>Deep Space 2 was a NASA space probe, part of the New Millennium Program. It included two highly advanced miniature space probes that were sent to Mars aboard the Mars Polar Lander in January 1999. The probes were named &quot;Scott&quot; and &quot;Amundsen&quot;, in honor of Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen, the first explorers to reach the Earth&#x27;s South Pole. Intended to be the first spacecraft to penetrate below the surface of another planet, after entering the Mars atmosphere DS2 was to detach from the Mars Polar Lander mother ship and plummet to the surface using only an aeroshell impactor, with no parachute. The mission was declared a failure on March 13, 2000, after all attempts to reestablish communications following the descent went unanswered.

The Deep Space 2 development costs were US$28 million.

== Overview ==
Deep Space 2, also known as &quot;Mars Microprobe,&quot; was the second spacecraft developed under the NASA New Millennium Program to flight-test advanced technologies concepts for space missions. The purpose of the program was to do high-risk technology demonstration, with a motto &quot;Taking risks to reduce future danger.&quot; The project was led and operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, with contributions from The University of Arizona, New Mexico State, Northern Arizona University, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and others.

The Deep Space 2 mission was intended to do an engineering validation of the concept of a penetrator probe, impacting the planet at high velocity, instead of slowing down for a soft landing as done by the probes conventionally used for planetary exploration. The penetrator concept is potentially a lower-cost approach, and has a proposed advantage of giving access to the subsurface of the planet being studied (in this case, Mars.)

Though the primary objective was to validate the technology, the probes also had goals for science analysis at Mars. These goals were “1) to derive the atmospheric density, pressure, and temperature throughout the entire atmospheric column, 2) to characterize the hardness of the soil and possibly the presence of layers at a scale of tens of centimeters, 3) to determine if ice is present in the subsurface soil, and, 4) to estimate the thermal conductivity of the soil at depth.” The eventual goal for such probes was to deploy networks “around a planet using no more resources than a single landing under conventional assumptions.”

The probes were launched with the Mars Polar Lander on January 3, 1999, on a Delta II 7425 Launch Vehicle.

===Spacecraft===
Each probe weighed and was encased in a protective aeroshell. They rode to Mars aboard another spacecraft, the Mars Polar Lander.

Upon arrival near the south polar region of Mars on December 3, 1999, the basketball-sized shells were released from the main spacecraft, plummeting through the atmosphere and hitting the planet&#x27;s surface at over . On impact, each shell was designed to shatter, and its grapefruit-sized probe was to punch through the soil and separate into two parts. The lower part, called the forebody, was designed to penetrate as far as into the soil. It contained the primary science instrument on board, the Evolved Water Experiment. The upper part of the probe, or aftbody, was designed to remain on the surface in order to transmit data through its UHF antenna to the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft in orbit around Mars. The Mars Global Surveyor would act as a relay in order to send the data collected back to Earth. The two sections of the probe were designed to remain connected via a data cable.

==Science Instruments==
The probes are each equipped with five instruments to enable analysis of the atmosphere, surface, and subsurface.

• &quot;Descent accelerometer:&quot; The descent accelerometer was a commercially available sensor meant to measure accelerations from drag during descent. Its readings could “be used to derive a density profile of the Martian atmosphere” based on the acceleration data combined with knowledge of the probe&#x27;s speed and ballistic coefficient.

• &quot;Impact accelerometer:&quot; The impact accelerometer was built with a range of ±120,000 g for the large expected acceleration on impact with Mars’ surface.

• &quot;Meteorological sensor:&quot; provides atmospheric pressure and temperature data at the landing site. This sensor was located on the back of the probe so that it would stay above the surface after impact. It was sampled and recorded by the telecommunications “which enables the acquisition of meteorological data in the event that the microcontroller failed during the impact.”

• &quot;Soil Thermal Conductivity Temperature Sensors:&quot; Twin platinum resistor temperature sensors would determine rates of cooling in the forebody once submerged in the surface.

• &quot;Evolved Water Experiment:&quot; A small sample collection system in the forebody would bring Martian regolith into a heating chamber. The sample would then be heated to allow spectroscopy measurements on the resulting vapor using a miniaturized tunable diode laser. The Evolved Water Experiment was the primary instrument on board the probe.

==New Technologies: High Impact and Low Temperature Electronics==
Custom electronics and batteries were designed for the Deep Space 2 probes to survive extremely high accelerations on impact with the surface of Mars and the cold temperatures that it would experience once in operation. Both the electronics and the custom cells were required to survive an impact on the order of 80,000 g and operational temperatures as low at -80 °C. Additionally, as much as a 30,000 g difference in acceleration was possible between the forebody and aftbody.

Batteries

Together with Yardney Technical Products, JPL designed a battery with two non-rechargeable 6-14V cells using Lithium-Thionyl Chloride (LI-SOCl2) chemistry to survive the expected conditions. The batteries were impact tested and also thermally cycled during development.

Electronics Packaging

Due to the probe&#x27;s form factor and the harsh survivability conditions, JPL used novel techniques to secure the onboard electronics. The techniques included chip-on-board (COB) technology to improve packing density. It also used a 1-meter flexible umbilical cable to connect the forebody penetrator that would be displaced upon impact. Mechanical (non-functioning) models were impact tested before launch to determine if the structures would survive.

== Mission failure ==
The probes reached Mars along with the Mars Polar Lander mission, apparently without incident, but communication was never established after impact. It is not known what the cause of failure was.

A failure review board was commissioned to report on the failures of the Mars Polar Lander and Deep Space 2 probes. The review board was unable to identify a probable cause of failure, but suggested several possible causes:
* The probe radio equipment had a low chance of surviving the impact.
* The batteries may have failed on impact.
* The probes may have bounced on impact.
* The probes may have landed on their sides, resulting in bad antenna performance or radio link geometry.
* The probes may simply have hit ground that was too rocky for survival.

The board concluded that the probes and their components were not tested adequately before launch.

==Aftermath==

Despite the failures of Mars Polar Lander and the two Deep Space 2 probes, Planum Australe, which served as their exploration target, would in later years be explored by European Space Agency&#x27;s MARSIS radar, which examined and analyzed the site from Mars&#x27; orbit and even determined that the area had water beneath its vast area of ice. Images which were obtained from MARSIS also determined that the water discovered beneath Planum Australe was in fact saltwater.

<text>The tiefling ( ) is a fictional humanoid race in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) fantasy roleplaying game. Originally introduced in the &quot;Planescape&quot; campaign setting in the second edition of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; as a player character race for the setting, they became one of the primary races available for player characters in the fourth edition of the game.

In the Planescape setting, where tieflings were introduced, they were described as being a mixture of human and &quot;something else&quot; with the implication that the medium-sized non-human ancestors originated from the evil &quot;lower planes&quot;. In further supplements it was clarified that tieflings were usually descended from fiends but not in the same manner as half-fiends, since a tiefling&#x27;s fiendish ancestry lies further up the family tree. This description remained true in 3rd Edition.

In 4th Edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, tieflings are a race whose human ancestors made a bargain with devils to increase their power. Their origin is similar in 5th Edition.

==Name==

The name, pronounced , was derived by Wolfgang Baur from the German word meaning &quot;deep, low&quot;, and the suffix , &quot;offspring,&quot; alluding to their origins in the &quot;lower planes&quot; (in the 2nd and 3rd editions).

==Publication history==
One of the first artists to depict the tiefling was Tony DiTerlizzi.

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition===
The tiefling was introduced in the &quot;Planescape Campaign Setting&quot; (1994) with more information in the first &quot;Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Planewalker&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1996).

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition===
The tiefling appears in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2000) under the &quot;planetouched&quot; entry.

The fey&#x27;ri and tanna&#x27;ruk tieflings appeared in &quot;Monsters of Faerun&quot; (2001). The tiefling is presented as a player character race for the Forgotten Realms setting in the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; (2001), and the tiefling and fey&#x27;ri appear as player character races in &quot;Races of Faerûn&quot; (2003).

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.5 edition===
The tiefling appears in the revised &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2003) under the planetouched entry.

The tiefling paragon was introduced in &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; (2004).

The tiefling appears as a player character race in the &quot;Planar Handbook&quot; (2004), and &quot;Races of Destiny&quot; (2004).

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition===
The tiefling appears as a player character race in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; for the 4th edition (2008), and again in &quot;Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms&quot; (2010). Tieflings also have a racial book dedicated to them in this edition, &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook Races: Tieflings&quot;.

William O&#x27;Connor, the artist responsible for designing tieflings in this edition, commented that there were few artistic depictions of the race in previous editions. However, with the tiefling becoming a core player race, the 4th edition design team &quot;wanted to radically update their appearance to make them look more intimidating and &#x27;cool&#x27;. [...] The horns and the tail were the defining elements of the race so my first direction was to make them as prominent as possible. Part of the design of the 4th edition was to integrate the design into being a miniature game so part of the process was to make the character&#x27;s silhouettes easily recognizable from a distance&quot;. O&#x27;Connor highlighted a conversation he had with the creative director Stacy Longstreet who described tieflings as a &quot;cursed people&quot; which helped him figure out &quot;their cultural aesthetic&quot;. O&#x27;Connor stated that:My immediate touchstone was of course vampires, and I worked to give the tielfing that sexy, dark and gothic appeal despite their &quot;deformity&quot;. I carried this idea over into everything about them, their clothes and equipment. I wanted everything to have a twisted aesthetic as if all of their prized heirlooms and weapons, all the relics of a lost past, were also cursed and contorted into horrible but beautiful shapes, imagining that the forms of the weapons should reflect the shapes of their tails. Elegant and deadly like the tielfing themselves.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition===
The tiefling appears as a player character race in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; for the 5th edition (2014). Variant tiefling options appear in the &quot;Sword Coast Adventure Guide&quot; (2015) and &quot;Mordenkainen&#x27;s Tome of Foes&quot; (2018). &quot;Mordenkainen&#x27;s Tome of Foes&quot; specifically outlines the nine tiefling bloodlines of the Archdevils of the Nine Hells.

The &quot;One D&amp;D&quot; playtest released in August 2022 updated the base tiefling to have &quot;options encompassing all the Lower Planes. Infernal tieflings are tied to lawful evil planes like Acheron or the Nine Hells, abyssal tieflings to chaotic evil planes like the Abyss or Pandemonium, and chthonic tieflings to neutral evil planes like Gehenna or Hades. The options differ in their damage resistances, and in the spells they learn at first, third, and fifth level&quot;.

==Fictional history==
In the setting of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th Edition, the tieflings trace their origins to the ancient human Empire of Bael Turath. In the Empire, the noble class was completely obsessed with preserving and gaining power. Rumors of their schemes and obsession with power reached a realm called the Nine Hells, located around the Astral Sea. The devils that resided in the Nine Hells gave the ruling classes of Bael Turath visions while they slept, containing the directions for a grisly, month-long ritual that would extend their rule into eternity. The details of the ritual have been left unclear in the books from the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; series describing the events, though it is described as being very horrible. As the ritual demanded the participation of every noble house, those that refused were wholly slaughtered. Once this was done, the ruling class began their ritual. Afterwards, devils from the Nine Hells began to appear, and the nobles gladly made pacts with them. These pacts gave power to the nobles and their descendants forever, but also gave them the devilish features of horns, non-prehensile tails, sharp teeth, and red skin. From that point forward, the former humans were the race known as the tieflings.

In the 5th Edition, the overlord of the Nine Hells, Asmodeus, is cited as the ancestral source of their devilish features.

==Aspects==
In earlier versions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, 3.5 and previous, tieflings have any of a number of features that reference (directly or indirectly) their fiendish lineage. These include horns located on their heads, pointed sharp teeth, extra fingers, cloven hooves in place of feet, tails, and unusually colored eyes. They exude a feeling of &quot;evil&quot; even though their race has become civil and no longer lusts for power. Many races distrust or outright hate tieflings, seeing them as devil worshippers. Tiefling villains often live up to this reputation, whereas player characters have the choice to abandon this stereotype.

In 4th edition and later, tieflings are a core character race and have had their appearance altered from 3.5 and earlier. All tieflings possess large thick horns of various styles on their heads, prehensile tails approximately 4 to 5 feet in length, sharply pointed teeth, and their eyes are solid orbs of red, black, white, silver, or gold. Tiefling skin ranges through common human shades right into the reds, ranging from brick red to a ruddy tan. Tiefling hair, which starts behind their horns, ranges from dark blue to purple to red in addition to more normal human colors.

Within the setting of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th Edition, tieflings are characterized as charismatic and self-reliant, and make excellent warlocks, warlords, and wizards.

In &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th Edition, tieflings do not associate with a specific god or gods. Their lack of faith also means paladins and clerics are seldom, if ever, found. Tieflings have no homeland and are very rare due to a long-lasting war with the dragonborn, another race seen in the 4th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Most tieflings prefer to be adventurers and rarely ever adventure with their own kin due to the prejudices of other races (people are concerned when two or more of their kind travel together).

In most editions, tiefling naming conventions consist of ancestral Infernal names. In 3.5, tieflings use human names until they seek to differentiate themselves from their parents, after which they usually take fiendish &quot;names&quot; of Infernal or Abyssal origin that sound menacing. In 4.0 onwards, tieflings usually take an ancestral Infernal name, although some young tieflings, striving to find a place in the world, choose a name that signifies a concept and then try to embody the concept.

In most editions, tieflings are described as slow to trust, but those who do earn their trust and loyalty earn a firm friend or ally for life.

==Alignment==
Unlike half-fiends, tieflings are not necessarily of evil alignments. Tieflings of all alignments exist, including good, although many take more shady jobs, such as that of thieves, assassins or spies. Tieflings are often portrayed as antiheroes.

In a standard 3.0 and 3.5 game, tieflings tend to have an unsettling air about them, and most people are uncomfortable around them, whether they are aware of the tiefling&#x27;s unsavory ancestry or not.

In 4th edition, tieflings have the same alignment choices as any other starting character.

In 5th edition, tieflings do not have an innate tendency towards evil, though many usually end up going down that path due to the prejudice against them. Also due to the prejudice against them, tieflings have a fierce independent streak and are inclined towards being chaotic.

==In various campaign settings==
Tieflings appear in a number of campaign settings, including the following notable examples:

===In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;===
In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign setting, both tieflings and aasimar are more common than in other settings. Tieflings even have elven and orc counterparts (Fey&#x27;ri and Tanarruk, respectively). In the 3rd Edition of Dungeons and Dragons, less common varieties of the tiefling were introduced, including a dwarven counterpart, the Maeluth and a halfling counterpart, the Wispling.

===In &quot;Planescape&quot;===
In the &quot;Planescape&quot; campaign setting, tieflings are a common race available to player characters, though they are mistrusted and reviled by many inhabitants of the planes.

===In Exandria===
In the campaign setting of &quot;Critical Role&quot; the first tieflings, also known as Devilkin, were created in the city of Vasselheim after a cabal of warlocks performed a ritual to contact fiendish forces, causing the birth of the first generation of tieflings. Asmodeus is often seen as the god tied to this particular race, although some myths mistakenly attribute their creation solely to him, and later than they have actually existed in this world. Despite the initial prejudice against them, after many centuries tieflings have become accepted in Exandria, even if they are not very common. Still, they prefer to avoid rural environments prone to superstition.

===In &quot;Pathfinder&quot;===
In the &quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot;, tieflings are commonly known by the colloquial term Hellspawn. Due to limitations in the Open Game License, they are referred to exclusively by this term in the &quot;Pathfinder Tales&quot; novels. In the empire of Cheliax, tieflings are subjugated and often enslaved, despite the royal house&#x27;s affiliation with Hell. Some tieflings have a stronger connection to one of the fiendish races, such as the grimspawn, who are descended from daemons, and the pitborn, who are descended from demons. There are also Kyton and other Fiend ancestries, with Devil ancestry Tieflings being called Hellspawn or Hellborn.

===Notable tieflings===
Livonia Darktongue appears in the book &quot;Weapons of Legacy&quot; in 2005.

===In &quot;Urban Arcana&quot;===
Tieflings are a playable race in &quot;Urban Arcana&quot;, which is based on the premise that races from &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; exist on earth. Most tieflings in Urban Arcana are humans with horns, although more obvious appearances exist. To regular humans who cannot perceive shadow, they appear to be cynical humans—the horns are not visible to those unable to perceive shadow.

==In other media==
In the PC game &quot;&quot; the player character is joined by Annah, a tiefling fighter/thief with a rat-like tail. In &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 2: Shadows of Amn&quot; the tiefling bard NPC Haer&#x27;Daelis can join the party. In &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark&quot;, Valen Shadowbreath, a tiefling weapons master, is a recruitable henchman and potential romance option. Arden Swift is a tiefling NPC who plays a minor role in the last act of the campaign. In &quot;Neverwinter Nights II&quot;, tiefling is a playable race and Neeshka, a female tiefling rogue, can join the party. Tieflings are also a playable race in the online MMORPG &quot;Neverwinter&quot;. Two variants of Tieflings are among the playable races in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot;.

The &quot;Brimstone Angels&quot; novels by Erin M. Evans, set in the Forgotten Realms, feature the tiefling warlock Farideh as the main character. One of the main characters in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; comic by John Rogers, Tisha Swornheart, is a tiefling warlock. The &quot;Pathfinder Tales&quot; novels by Dave Gross feature the tiefling Rogue Radovan Virholt as one of the two primary protagonists.

Sophia Lillis portrays Doric, a tiefling druid, in the 2023 film &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&quot;. Doric also appears in a prequel novel – &quot;The Druid’s Call&quot; (2023) by E.K. Johnston.

==Analysis==
Johnny L. Wilson called tieflings &quot;the paranoid, loner obverse&quot; of halflings, who &quot;believe that life is out to get them&quot;. Looking at the 2nd edition of the game, Wilson found them &quot;suited to be great thieves&quot; and &quot;great point persons&quot; due to favorable saving throw bonuses.

Philip J. Clements assumed tieflings are popular as player characters because they allow for &quot;identity tourism&quot; of a racial outsider: Tieflings in the game world &quot;are often treated as dangerous outsiders. Yet D&amp;D&#x27;s default assumption is that the players will portray heroes. The idea of playing the racial outsider who nonetheless protects the people who wrongly revile them is a well-known trope built into D&amp;D&quot;. Clements found this stereotype associated with the tiefling problematic, as the &quot;solution is usually to focus on individual good, rather than confronting deeper, systemic problems of racial politics&quot;.

<doc id="435389" wikidata="Q5133008" url="?curid=435389" title="Clifford Milburn Holland">
<text>Clifford Milburn Holland (March 13, 1883 – October 27, 1924) was an American civil engineer who oversaw the construction of a number of subway and automobile tunnels in New York City, and for whom the Holland Tunnel is named.

==Life==
Holland was born in Somerset, Massachusetts. He was the only child of Edward John Holland and Lydia Frances Hood. He attended Cambridge Latin School. Holland graduated from Harvard University with a B.A. in 1905 and a B.S. in Civil Engineering in 1906. On November 5, 1908, he married Anna Coolidge Davenport (1885–1973), who was originally from Watertown and had graduated from Radcliffe College. They had four daughters.

Immediately after graduation, Holland began his career in New York City working as an assistant engineer on the construction of the Joralemon Street Tunnel. He then served as the engineer-in-charge of construction of the Clark Street Tunnel, 60th Street Tunnel, Montague Street Tunnel and the 14th Street Tunnel. Each one was built by boring out a tunnel under the river bed, while keeping it filled with compressed air so the water would not seep into it. A cylinder was pushed into the tunnel to protect the workers and allowing the workers to build a cast-iron lining.

Holland was the first chief engineer on the Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel project, earning an annual salary of $10,000. Holland conducted experiments in a small tunnel in a coal mine in Bruceton, Pennsylvania, in order to determine how to safely and sufficiently vent vehicles&#x27; carbon monoxide out of the tunnel and keep the passengers safe. Holland designed four ventilation shafts that would bring of fresh air into the tunnel every minute. Construction on the tunnel began April 1, 1922, when Holland ceremoniously drove a pick into the ground at Canal and West streets in Manhattan.

The stress and long hours working on the tunnel project caused him to have a nervous breakdown, and he went to a sanatorium in Battle Creek, Michigan, in order to recover. On October 27, 1924, Holland died of a heart attack there, at the age of 41. He died one day before the final charge of dynamite connected the two tunnels. At the time of his death, he lived at 2416 Avenue J in Midwood, Brooklyn. The funeral service was held at the Lefferts Place Chapel. Milton Harvey Freeman took over as chief engineer on the project after Holland&#x27;s death. Freeman died five months later.

The project was renamed the Holland Tunnel in his memory by the New York State Bridge and Tunnel Commission and the New Jersey Interstate Bridge and Tunnel Commission on its opening day, November 12, 1924, sixteen days after Holland&#x27;s death. At the time it opened, the Holland Tunnel was the first vehicular tunnel in the United States and the fifth in the world.

<doc id="435391" wikidata="Q312245" url="?curid=435391" title="Mehmet Ali Talat">
<text>Mehmet Ali Talat (born 6 July 1952) is a Turkish Cypriot politician who served as the president of Northern Cyprus from 2005 to 2010. Talat was the leader of the social democratic Republican Turkish Party (, CTP), from 1996 to 2005 and 2015 to 2016. He became prime minister in 2004, and subsequently won the presidential election held on 17 April 2005. Talat was inaugurated on 25 April 2005, succeeding retiring leader Rauf Denktaş. He lost the presidential election of 2010 and was replaced by Derviş Eroğlu as President.

==Early life==

Talat was born in Kyrenia on 6 July 1952. Completing his secondary education in Cyprus, Talat graduated from Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department of the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey.

Involved in various political activities since he was a university student, Talat continued after he returned to Cyprus, and played an important role in the establishment of Turkish Cypriot trade unions and the &quot;Turkish Cypriot Students&#x27; Youth Federation&quot; (KOGEF), becoming the first chairman of its executive board.

He also participated in the youth movement of the Republican Turkish Party, and served in various committees and organs of the CTP for many years. He served as the party secretary for Education.

==Political career==
=== Early political career and party leadership ===
Talat joined the CTP in 1973 and soon rose to the party leadership. He worked as a refrigerator repairman during this time. He was a senior figure in the party when the independence of Northern Cyprus was declared in 1983. The CTP had opposed the creation of an independent state in the north previously, distributing anti-independence pamphlets days before the declaration. However, according to Talat, the party had been threatened by Denktaş to prevent them from voting against the declaration. Talat was one of those against voting for in the internal party debate, but the party leadership narrowly decided to vote for independence. Talat later controversially stated that he had cried after this meeting.

Talat was the Minister of Education and Culture in the first coalition government formed by the CTP-Democratic Party (DP) Alliance after the general elections of December 1993. He undertook the same post in the second DP-CTP coalition government, and became the Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister in the third DP-CTP coalition government.

Talat was elected as the leader of the CTP on 14 January 1996, succeeding Özker Özgür. After being elected to the TRNC parliament on 14 December 2003, Talat formed another CTP-DP coalition government on 13 January 2004, at the behest of the then-TRNC President Rauf Denktaş, when the incumbent Prime minister Derviş Eroğlu was unable to do so.

=== Presidency ===

Winning a victory in the 20 February 2005 general elections, Talat formed the second CTP-DP coalition, serving as Prime Minister until his election as the second TRNC President on 17 April 2005, when he asked CTP Deputy Leader Ferdi Sabit Soyer to form a new government. As part of his cabinet, he appointed Raşit Pertev as Chief Negotiator for the United Nations Peace Talks.

During the 2004 referendum on the Annan Plan to extinguish the Republic of Cyprus through the formation of a loose confederation along ethnic division in advance of its entry to the European Union, Talat promoted a &#x27;Yes&#x27; vote among Turkish Cypriots and the plan received overwhelming endorsement north of the Green Line. However, Tassos Papadopoulos, the then President of the Republic of Cyprus, opposed the plan and the Greek Cypriot community rejected it by a large majority opting for an as yet undefined constitution along the EU norms principles such as universal suffrage. As a consequence, the plan was dropped, but the EU declared it would seek to implement trade concessions and other measures designed to alleviate the isolation of Northern Cyprus as a reward for the Turkish Cypriot referendum result. Talat remained publicly committed to reunification. However the pro-solutionist side and Mehmet Al Talat lost momentum, because of the ongoing embargo and isolation, despite promises from the European Union of easing them, which did not occur, and as a result the Turkish Cypriot electorate became frustrated. This led ultimately to the pro-independence side winning the general elections in 2009 and its candidate, former Prime Minister Derviş Eroğlu winning the presidential elections in 2010. Although his side and he himself disagrees with and opposes re-unification with the Republic of Cyprus, and favours the unity of and close relations between northern Cyprus and Turkey and supports the independence of the former, he nevertheless is negotiating with the Greek Cypriot side towards a settlement for reunification, to establish a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation in Cyprus, based on the political equality of the two communities, single sovereignty, single citizenship and international identity.

=== Return to politics ===
On 14 June 2015, Talat won the congress of the CTP and became the leader of the party again. Under his leadership, the Yorgancıoğlu cabinet resigned and was replaced by a cabinet headed by Ömer Kalyoncu, in a grand coalition with the National Unity Party (UBP). Talat was sometimes dubbed as the &quot;shadow leader&quot; of the cabinet, though he refused this designation. The government fell due to the UBP&#x27;s withdrawal after friction with Turkey on the economic protocol to be signed between the two states and the question of the management of the Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project. Talat then became the leader of the main opposition as UBP and DP formed a government. On 22 May 2016, he announced that he would not be a candidate for the party&#x27;s leadership in the next congress, due in November 2016.

== Personal life ==
Mehmet Ali Talat is married to Oya Talat, a chemist and women&#x27;s rights activist. The couple got married on 29 October 1978. They have a daughter and a son.

<text>Rubén Aguirre Fuentes (; 15 June 1934 – 17 June 2016) was a Mexican actor and comedian. He was best known for his character Professor Jirafales in Televisa&#x27;s 1970s television show &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;. Aguirre also participated in another well known television show of the era, &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;, albeit less frequently.

==Life and education==
Rubén Aguirre was born on 15 June 1934 in the neighborhood of Santa Anita located at Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico.

In his book &quot;Después de Usted&quot; (&quot;After You&quot;, a common phrase used by his character Professor Jirafales), published in February 2015, he wrote about the difficulty of finding higher education institutions in Mexico during the mid 1950s, since there were very few schools. This is why in his late teenage years, he moved to Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, to study in one of the most renowned universities of that time, the Escuela Superior de Agricultura &quot;Hermanos Escobar&quot;, where he studied Agricultural Engineering.

Once in Juárez, he would regularly cross into the United States, since according to his memoir, &quot;it was so easy to cross the border back then, I remember I would put on my college jacket on and since the gringo would see that you were a student, he would let you through&quot;. Rubén Aguirre worked many times as a gardener in El Paso to make ends meet.

It was in Juárez, as well, where he began his career in the media as an unofficial radio host and bullfighting commentator. His passion to become a radio announcer was so big that he paused his college education to travel to Mexico City and get his radio license.

He returned to Juárez and began working as a radio host; he married his wife Consuelo de los Reyes, whom he met at a bullfight, finished his degree in Agricultural Engineering with a minor in Mechanized Systems and some time after he moved to Monterrey, Nuevo León, where he began his acting career and met Roberto Gómez Bolaños.

==Work==
When he first began looking for acting work, he was told that at 6&#x27;7&quot;, he was too tall. Nevertheless, despite his height, he was able to begin his acting career in Monterrey, Nuevo León, working with a character named &quot;Pipo&quot;, a famous clown. His acting caught the eye of Mexican producer Roberto Gómez Bolaños who asked him to work with him in Mexico City. Aguirre went on to Mexico City where he worked on several television scripts with Gómez Bolaños, creator and main star of both &quot;El Chavo&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;.

Aguirre garnered fame across Latin America when both &quot;El Chavo&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; became major international hits. The group of actors that comprised the casts of both shows toured often, and sometimes they would venture out on their own. Aguirre was not the exception, visiting such places as Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Brazil many times. Chespirito owned the rights to &quot;El Chavo&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;. After Aguirre&#x27;s participation in both shows was over, he moved to Argentina and opened a circus there. Chespirito had no copyrights in Argentina, and Aguirre was able to name his circus &quot;El Circo del Profesor Jirafales&quot;.

==Death==
Aguirre died on 17 June 2016, from pneumonia complications at his home in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, two days after his 82nd birthday.

<doc id="435393" wikidata="Q7282087" url="?curid=435393" title="Rafael Cordero Santiago">
<text>Rafael Cordero Santiago (24 October 1942 – 17 January 2004), better known as &quot;Churumba&quot;, was the Mayor of Ponce, Puerto Rico, from 1989 to 2004. Many considered him as a synonym of Ponce, being baptized as &quot;El León Mayor&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The Greatest Lion&quot;), an allusion to the city&#x27;s official symbol, the lion. Mayor Cordero was a firm believer in the government decentralization process.

During Cordero Santiago&#x27;s term in the Ponce mayoral office, the city saw the construction of the Julio Enrique Monagas Family Park, the Tricentennial Park Plaza, and the La Guancha Boardwalk. In 1991, he established an initiative for a restoration project for the 25 de Enero Street historical area, and in 1990 he launched the conversion of the old Parque de Bombas into a museum. Also in 1990, he facilitated the establishment of Castillo Serralles as a museum led by a civic, nongovernmental organization.

Cordero Santiago is credited with re-establishing the &quot;Ponce en Marcha&quot; project in 1992, and there are some who also credit him with the passage by the Puerto Rico Legislature of the Autonomous Municipalities Act of 1991. One of his projects under &quot;Ponce en Marcha&quot; was the restoration of the Ponce Casino, as depicted on the plaque at the northern exterior wall of the restored casino building on Calle Marina and Calle Luna.

==Early years==
Cordero was born in Barrio Playa in Ponce, Puerto Rico, to Don Bernardino Cordero-Bernard and Doña María de los Santos Santiago. While still a young boy, his family moved to Calle Lolita Tizol in the Ponce Historic Zone. He attended public schools in Ponce: Ramiro Colon and Rafael Pujals elementary schools, McKinley middle school, and Ponce High School. He graduated from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico in 1964 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Arts with a concentration in Political Sciences, Economy, and Social Sciences. While a university student, Cordero was a member of the Nu Sigma Beta fraternity Delta chapter. As a child he was nicknamed &quot;Churaumba&quot;, a nickname he carried into adulthood. &quot;Churumba&quot; was a nickname given in reference to Cordero&#x27;s height; it is a Puerto Rican Spanish name given to small spinning tops. The name probably derived from the Andalusian Spanish term &quot;churumbel&quot;, used to describe a small child.

Cordero was involved in Puerto Rican politics since 1969, when he began working as a special aide to former Governor of Puerto Rico Rafael Hernández Colón, then president of the Puerto Rico Senate. A member of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), Cordero went on to work in the Departments of Finance and Workers&#x27; Rights (Spanish: &quot;Departamento del Derecho al Trabajo&quot;).

==Mayor of Ponce==
In 1988, Cordero received the endorsement of then governor Rafael Hernández Colón for the office of Mayor of the city of Ponce and won the elections for the PPD by 1,617 votes against his opponent Helcías Bermúdez of the New Progressive Party that same year. He won re-elections in 1992, 1996, and 2000.

Among Cordero Santiago&#x27;s many achievements as mayor are the construction of the Julio Enrique Monagas Family Park, the largest family park in Puerto Rico. The park, which opened in 1994 and was named to honor the founder of the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee, covers some and is located at the confluence of the Bucaná and Portugues rivers. Cordero Santiago also built the Tricentennial Park Plaza in 1992, the La Guancha Boardwalk, and is credited with re-establishing the &quot;Ponce en Marcha&quot; project in 1992. In 1991, mayor Cordero Santiago instituted a restoration project for the 25 de Enero Street homes, the street per se, and surrounding area based on their historical value. In 1990, the administration of Cordero Santiago restored the old Parque de Bombas and turned it into a museum that preserves the history of Ponce&#x27;s firefighters. On Cordero&#x27;s credit list is also facilitating the establishment of Castillo Serralles as a museum in 1990. There are some who also credit him with the establishment of the Autonomous Municipalities Act of 1991. He was also instrumental in the celebration of the 1993 XVII Central American and Caribbean Games held in Ponce.

In late 2003, Cordero signed and initiated the construction of a multimillion-dollar mega port complex in Ponce named Port of the Americas, a project he fought for during several years. The project is expected to generate much needed jobs for Ponce residents, and improve the local Mercedita Airport and the Ponce hotel industry. Upon his death in 2004, the project was still in construction. On 28 June 2004, via Law 166, the Legislature of Puerto Rico renamed the Port of the Americas as
the &#x27;Rafael &quot;Churumba&quot; Cordero Santiago Port of the Americas&#x27;, in his honor.

Churumba is widely regarded as author of a saying that is still used today:

A strong believer in the removal of the U.S. Navy from the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, Cordero was arrested in 2001 and imprisoned for 30 days after practicing civil disobedience during the Navy-Vieques protests by illegally trespassing the restricted grounds of the United States Navy on Vieques.

==Death and funeral==

Churumba died on 17 January 2004 at 9:00 AM AST in the Medical Center of Río Piedras at the age of 61 after slipping into a coma and suffering a brain hemorrhage. His wish of posthumously donating his organs was fulfilled.

The funeral guard was held on 18 January in the Juan Pachín Vicéns Auditorium with a rotatory guard of politicians, public servicemen and the various sport teams of Ponce. Many visitors cheered &quot;&quot;Long live Churumba!&quot; and &quot;We love you!&quot; The electronic board of the auditorium displayed the words &quot;The Greatest Lion rests in peace&quot;&quot;.

Churumba&#x27;s coffin was later returned to a local funeral home for a family veil guard. The day after, on Monday, 19 January, a prayer was offered at the Catedral de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe after exposing the mortal remains in the former mayor&#x27;s home. Cordero&#x27;s burial was held in the La Piedad Cemetery in Ponce. Former Governor Rafael Hernández Colón and his brother were in charge of the oratory mourning.

His remains were subsequently transferred to the Panteon Nacional Roman Baldorioty de Castro near downtown Ponce, where they are currently located in a prominent mausoleum.

==Personal life==
Cordero was married to Madeleine Velasco Alvarado. They had two daughters, fraternal twin sisters Solange Marie and Mara Bianca.

After game seven of the Puerto Rico National Basketball League 2004 Finals, when the Ponce Lions won their twelfth championship, player Antonio Colón lifted Cordero&#x27;s usual courtside seat igniting Ponce fans into celebration. The championship was officially dedicated to Cordero. Cordero&#x27;s seat was reserved open during every Ponce Lions home game in 2004, in his honor.

==Honors==
On 13 August 2008, the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly approved Law 256, naming Route PR-9, a controlled access highway which circles the city of Ponce, as the &quot;Rafael (Churumba) Cordero Santiago Highway.&quot; Cordero Santiago is also honored at Ponce&#x27;s Park of Illustrious Ponce Citizens. Only six other, of over 100 former Ponce mayors, are honored there. In Barrio Playa, his homebarrio, there is thoroughfare near Plaza del Caribe, named after him; a large image of his face stands at the beginning of the thoroughfare. The Port of Ponce was also renamed after him; it is now called the Rafael Cordero Santiago Port of the Americas.

==Quotes==
This phrase has become a common catchphrase among &quot;ponceños&quot;, who are usually regarded for the pride they show for the city. &quot;This [phrase] is in reference to the massive traffic jams experienced in the San Juan metropolitan area where highways resemble parking lots certain times of the day.&quot; Cordero&#x27;s widow, Madeleine Velasco, used the phrase at the closing of her late husband&#x27;s funeral in his honor.

<doc id="435397" wikidata="Q3503672" url="?curid=435397" title="Automatic meter reading">
<text>Automatic meter reading (AMR) is the technology of automatically collecting consumption, diagnostic, and status data from water meter or energy metering devices (gas, electric) and transferring that data to a central database for billing, troubleshooting, and analyzing.
This technology mainly saves utility providers the expense of periodic trips to each physical location to read a meter. Another advantage is that billing can be based on near real-time consumption rather than on estimates based on past or predicted consumption. This timely information coupled with analysis can help both utility providers and customers better control the use and production of electric energy, gas usage, or water consumption.

AMR technologies include handheld, mobile and network technologies based on telephony platforms (wired and wireless), radio frequency (RF), or powerline transmission.

==Technologies==

=== Touch technology===
With touch-based AMR, a meter reader carries a handheld computer or data collection device with a wand or probe. The device automatically collects the readings from a meter by touching or placing the read probe in close proximity to a reading coil enclosed in the touchpad. When a button is pressed, the probe sends an interrogate signal to the touch module to collect the meter reading. The software in the device matches the serial number to one in the route database, and saves the meter reading for later download to a billing or data collection computer. Since the meter reader still has to go to the site of the meter, this is sometimes referred to as &quot;on-site&quot; AMR. Another form of contact reader uses a standardized infrared port to transmit data. Protocols are standardized between manufacturers by such documents as ANSI C12.18 or IEC 61107.

=== AMR hosting ===
AMR hosting is a back-office solution which allows a user to track their electricity, water, or gas consumption over the Internet. All data is collected in near real-time, and is stored in a database by data acquisition software. The user can view the data via a web application, and can analyze the data using various online analysis tools such as charting load profiles, analyzing tariff components, and verify their utility bill.

=== Radio frequency network===
Radio frequency based AMR can take many forms. The more common ones are handheld, mobile, satellite and fixed network solutions. There are both two-way RF systems and one-way RF systems in use that use both licensed and unlicensed RF bands.

In a two-way or &quot;wake up&quot; system, a radio signal is normally sent to an AMR meter&#x27;s unique serial number, instructing its transceiver to power-up and transmit its data. The meter transceiver and the reading transceiver both send and receive radio signals. In a one-way &quot;bubble-up&quot; or continuous broadcast type system, the meter transmits continuously and data is sent every few seconds. This means the reading device can be a receiver only, and the meter a transmitter only. Data travels only from the meter transmitter to the reading receiver. There are also hybrid systems that combine one-way and two-way techniques, using one-way communication for reading and two-way communication for programming functions.

RF-based meter reading usually eliminates the need for the meter reader to enter the property or home, or to locate and open an underground meter pit. The utility saves money by increased speed of reading, has less liability from entering private property, and has fewer missed readings from being unable to access the meter.

The technology based on RF is not readily accepted everywhere. In several Asian countries, the technology faces a barrier of regulations in place pertaining to use of the radio frequency of any radiated power. For example, in India the radio frequency which is generally in ISM band is not free to use even for low power radio of 10 mW. The majority of manufacturers of electricity meters have radio frequency devices in the frequency band of 433/868 MHz for large scale deployment in European countries. The frequency band of 2.4 GHz can be now used in India for outdoor as well as indoor applications, but few manufacturers have shown products within this frequency band. Initiatives in radio frequency AMR in such countries are being taken up with regulators wherever the cost of licensing outweighs the benefits of AMR.

==== Handheld ====
In handheld AMR, a meter reader carries a handheld computer with a built-in or attached receiver/transceiver (radio frequency or touch) to collect meter readings from an AMR capable meter. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;walk-by&quot; meter reading since the meter reader walks by the locations where meters are installed as they go through their meter reading route. Handheld computers may also be used to manually enter readings without the use of AMR technology as an alternate but this will not support exhaustive data which can be accurately read using the meter reading electronically.

==== Mobile ====
Mobile or &quot;drive-by&quot; meter reading is where a reading device is installed in a vehicle. The meter reader drives the vehicle while the reading device automatically collects the meter readings. Often, for mobile meter reading, the reading equipment includes navigational and mapping features provided by GPS and mapping software. With mobile meter reading, the reader does not normally have to read the meters in any particular route order, but just drives the service area until all meters are read. Components often consist of a laptop or proprietary computer, software, RF receiver/transceiver, and external vehicle antennas.

==== Satellite ====
Transmitters for data collection satellites can be installed in the field next to existing meters. The satellite AMR devices communicate with the meter for readings, and then sends those readings over a fixed or mobile satellite network. This network requires a clear view to the sky for the satellite transmitter/receiver, but eliminates the need to install fixed towers or send out field technicians, thereby being particularly suited for areas with low geographic meter density.

==== RF technologies commonly used for AMR ====
* Narrow Band (single fixed radio frequency)
* Spread spectrum
** Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)
** Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)

There are also meters using AMR with RF technologies such as cellular phone data systems, Zigbee, Bluetooth, Wavenis and others. Some systems operate with U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensed frequencies and others under FCC Part 15, which allows use of unlicensed radio frequencies.

==== Wi-Fi ====
WiSmart is a versatile platform which can be used by a variety of electrical home appliances in order to provide wireless TCP/IP communication using the 802.11 b/g protocol.

Devices such as the Smart Thermostat permit a utility to lower a home&#x27;s power consumption to help manage power demand.

The city of Corpus Christi became one of the first cities in the United States to implement citywide Wi-Fi, which had been free until May 31, 2007, mainly to facilitate AMR after a meter reader was attacked by a dog. Today many meters are designed to transmit using Wi-Fi, even if a Wi-Fi network is not available, and they are read using a drive-by local Wi-Fi hand held receiver.

The meters installed in Corpus Christi are not directly Wi-Fi enabled, but rather transmit narrow-band burst telemetry on the 460 MHz band. This narrow-band signal has much greater range than Wi-Fi, so the number of receivers required for the project are far fewer. Special receiver stations then decode the narrow-band signals and resend the data via Wi-Fi.

Most of the automated utility meters installed in the Corpus Christi area are battery powered. Wi-Fi technology is unsuitable for long-term battery-powered operation.

=== Power line communication ===
PLC is a method where electronic data is transmitted over power lines back to the substation, then relayed to a central computer in the utility&#x27;s main office. This would be considered a type of fixed network system—the network being the distribution network which the utility has built and maintains to deliver electric power. Such systems are primarily used for electric meter reading. Some providers have interfaced gas and water meters to feed into a PLC type system.

== Brief history==
In 1972, Theodore George &quot;Ted&quot; Paraskevakos, while working with Boeing in Huntsville, Alabama, developed a sensor monitoring system which used digital transmission for security, fire and medical alarm systems as well as meter reading capabilities for all utilities. This technology was a spin-off of the automatic telephone line identification system, now known as caller ID.

In 1974, Paraskevakos was awarded a U.S. patent for this technology. In 1977, he launched Metretek, Inc., which developed and produced the first fully automated, commercially available remote meter reading and load management system. Since this system was developed pre-Internet, Metretek utilized the IBM series 1 mini-computer. For this approach, Paraskevakos and Metretek were awarded multiple patents.

The primary driver for the automation of meter reading is not to reduce labor costs, but to obtain data that is difficult to obtain. As an example, many water meters are installed in locations that require the utility to schedule an appointment with the homeowner in order to obtain access to the meter. In many areas, consumers have demanded that their monthly water bill be based on an actual reading, instead of (for example) an estimated monthly usage based on just one actual meter reading made every 12 months. Early AMR systems often consisted of walk-by and drive-by AMR for residential customers, and telephone-based AMR for commercial or industrial customers. What was once a need for monthly data became a need for daily and even hourly readings of the meters. Consequently, the sales of drive-by and telephone AMR has declined in the US, while sales of fixed networks has increased. The US Energy Policy Act of 2005 asks that electric utility regulators consider the support for a &quot;...time-based rate schedule &quot;(to)&quot; enable the electric consumer to manage energy use and cost through advanced metering and communications technology.&quot;
The trend now is to consider the use of advanced meters as part of an advanced metering infrastructure.

=== Advanced AMR and AMI ===
Originally AMR devices just collected meter readings electronically and matched them with accounts. As technology has advanced, additional data could then be captured, stored, and transmitted to the main computer, and often the metering devices could be controlled remotely. This can include events alarms such as tamper, leak detection, low battery, or reverse flow. Many AMR devices can also capture interval data, and log meter events. The logged data can be used to collect or control time of use or rate of use data that can be used for water or energy usage profiling, time of use billing, demand forecasting, demand response, rate of flow recording, leak detection, flow monitoring, water and energy conservation enforcement, remote shutoff, etc. Advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI is the new term coined to represent the networking technology of fixed network meter systems that go beyond AMR into remote utility management. The meters in an AMI system are often referred to as smart meters, since they often can use collected data based on programmed logic.

The Automatic Meter Reading Association (AMRA) endorses the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) resolution to eliminate regulatory barriers to the broad implementation of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). The resolution, passed in February 2007, acknowledged the role of AMI in supporting the implementation of dynamic pricing and the resulting benefits to consumers. The resolution further identified the value of AMI in achieving significant utility operational cost savings in the areas of outage management, revenue protection and asset management. The resolution also called for AMI business case analysis to identify cost-effective deployment strategies, endorsed timely cost recovery for prudently incurred AMI expenditures and made additional recommendations on rate making and tax treatment of such investments.

===Benefits of advanced metering===
Advanced metering systems can provide benefits for utilities, retail providers and customers. Benefits will be recognized by the utilities with increased efficiencies, outage detection, tamper notification and reduced labor cost as a result of automating reads, connections and disconnects. Retail providers will be able to offer new innovative products in addition to customizing packages for their customers. In addition, with the meter data being readily available, more flexible billing cycles would be available to their customers instead of following the standard utility read cycles. With timely usage information available to the customer, benefits will be seen through opportunities to manage their energy consumption and change from one REP to another with actual meter data. Because of these benefits, many utilities are moving towards implementing some types of AMR solutions.

In many cases, smart metering is required by law (e.g. Pennsylvania&#x27;s Act 129 (2008)).

The benefits of smart metering for the utility.

* Accurate meter reading, no more estimates
* Improved billing
* Accurate profile classes and measurement classes, true costs applied
* Improved security and tamper detection for equipment
* Energy management through profile data graphs
* Less financial burden correcting mistakes
* Less accrued expenditure
* Transparency of &quot;cost to read&quot; metering
* Improved procurement power though more accurate data — &quot;de-risking&quot; price
* In cases of shortages, utility will be able to manage/allocate supply.

The benefits of smart metering for the customer.
* Improved billing and tracking of usage.

===Disadvantages of advanced metering===

* Risk of loss of privacy — details of use reveal information about user activities
* Greater potential for monitoring by other/unauthorized third parties
* Potentially reduced reliability (more complicated meters, more potential for interference by third parties)
* Increased security risks from network or remote access

=== Notable deployments ===
Construction practices, weather, and the need for information drive utilities in different parts of the world towards AMR at different rates. In the US, there have been significant fixed network deployments of both RF based and PLC based technologies. Some countries have either deployed or plan to deploy AMR systems throughout the entire country.

==== SPAR ====
By using a combination of AMR and energy analytics reports, SPAR were able to reduce energy consumption by 20%.

==== Australia ====
AMI in Australia has grown from both government policy which sought to rectify observed market inefficiencies, and distribution businesses who looked to gain operational efficiencies. In July 2008, there was a mandated program being planned in Victoria for the deployment of 2.6 million meters over a 4-year period. The anticipated peak installation rate of AMI meters was 5,000 per day across Victoria. The program governance was provided by an industry steering committee.

In 2009 the Victorian Auditor General undertook a review of the program and found that there were &quot;significant inadequacies&quot; in advice to Government and that project governance &quot;has not been appropriate&quot;. The Victorian government subsequently announced a moratorium of the program
*Public Utility Commission of Texas Report 2006
*Pennsylvania, (Exelon-PECO) 2.2 million meters deployed
*Missouri, (Ameren) 1.7 million meters deployed.

== The future of AMR ==
With the growing adoption of AMI meters and systems, AMR has been in decline in the U.S. electric utility sector. However, in the gas and water sectors, where it tends to be more expensive and complicated to replace meters, AMR remains prevalent, and some utilities continue to invest in new AMR meter deployments. Going forward, utilities face a choice to replace AMR with AMI—often at great expense and time investment—or to explore an AMx strategy using modern signal collection and processing technology that allows for more frequent wireless data collection from existing AMR meters (in some cases down to every 30 seconds) while offering increased interoperability with other (potentially more advanced) meters in areas where they make offer incremental benefits. Whereas the first approach is likely to continue the gradual decline of AMR, the latter approach could lead to a resurgence of interest in next-generation AMR meters that can unlock near-real-time data at lower cost and with longer useful lives, while also virtually eliminating the need for trucks to drive by for data collection.

<text>Common and special causes are the two distinct origins of variation in a process, as defined in the statistical thinking and methods of Walter A. Shewhart and W. Edwards Deming. Briefly, &quot;common causes&quot;, also called natural patterns, are the usual, historical, quantifiable variation in a system, while &quot;special causes&quot; are unusual, not previously observed, non-quantifiable variation.

The distinction is fundamental in philosophy of statistics and philosophy of probability, with different treatment of these issues being a classic issue of probability interpretations, being recognised and discussed as early as 1703 by Gottfried Leibniz; various alternative names have been used over the years. The distinction has been particularly important in the thinking of economists Frank Knight, John Maynard Keynes and G. L. S. Shackle.

==Origins and concepts==
In 1703, Jacob Bernoulli wrote to Gottfried Leibniz to discuss their shared interest in applying mathematics and probability to games of chance. Bernoulli speculated whether it would be possible to gather mortality data from gravestones and thereby calculate, by their existing practice, the probability of a man currently aged 20 years outliving a man aged 60 years. Leibniz replied that he doubted this was possible:

This captures the central idea that some variation is predictable, at least approximately in frequency. This &quot;common-cause variation&quot; is evident from the experience base. However, new, unanticipated, emergent or previously neglected phenomena (e.g. &quot;new diseases&quot;) result in variation outside the historical experience base. Shewhart and Deming argued that such &quot;special-cause variation&quot; is fundamentally unpredictable in frequency of occurrence or in severity.

John Maynard Keynes emphasised the importance of special-cause variation when he wrote:

==Definitions==
===Common-cause variations===
Common-cause variation is characterised by:
*Phenomena constantly active within the system;
*Variation predictable probabilistically;
*Irregular variation within a historical experience base; and
*Lack of significance in individual high or low values.

The outcomes of a perfectly balanced roulette wheel are a good example of common-cause variation. Common-cause variation is the &quot;noise&quot; within the system.

Walter A. Shewhart originally used the term &quot;chance cause&quot;. The term &quot;common cause&quot; was coined by Harry Alpert in 1947. The Western Electric Company used the term &quot;natural pattern&quot;. Shewhart called a process that features only common-cause variation as being &quot;in statistical control&quot;. This term is deprecated by some modern statisticians who prefer the phrase &quot;stable and predictable&quot;.

===Special-cause variation===
Special-cause variation is characterised by:
*New, unanticipated, emergent or previously neglected phenomena within the system;
*Variation inherently unpredictable, even probabilistically;
*Variation outside the historical experience base; and
*Evidence of some inherent change in the system or our knowledge of it.

Special-cause variation always arrives as a surprise. It is the &quot;signal&quot; within a system.

Walter A. Shewhart originally used the term &quot;assignable cause&quot;. The term &quot;special-cause&quot; was coined by W. Edwards Deming. The Western Electric Company used the term &quot;unnatural pattern&quot;.

==Examples==
===Common causes===
* Inappropriate procedures
* Poor design
* Poor maintenance of machines
* Lack of clearly defined standard operating procedures
* Poor working conditions, e.g. lighting, noise, dirt, temperature, ventilation
* Substandard raw materials
* Measurement error
* Quality control error
* Vibration in industrial processes
* Ambient temperature and humidity
* Normal wear and tear
* Variability in settings
* Computer response time

===Special causes===
* Faulty adjustment of equipment
* Operator falls asleep
* Defective controllers
* Machine malfunction
* Fall of ground
* Computer crash
* Deficient batch of raw material
* Power surges
* High healthcare demand from elderly people
* Broken part
* Insufficient awareness
* Abnormal traffic (click fraud) on web ads
* Extremely long lab testing turnover time due to switching to a new computer system
* Operator absent

==Importance to economics==

In economics, this circle of ideas is analysed under the rubric of &quot;Knightian uncertainty&quot;. John Maynard Keynes and Frank Knight both discussed the inherent unpredictability of economic systems in their work and used it to criticise the mathematical approach to economics, in terms of expected utility, developed by Ludwig von Mises and others. Keynes in particular argued that economic systems did not automatically tend to the equilibrium of full employment owing to their agents&#x27; inability to predict the future. As he remarked in &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;:

Keynes&#x27; thinking was at odds with the classical liberalism of the Austrian School of economists, but G. L. S. Shackle recognised the importance of Keynes&#x27;s insight and sought to formalise it within a free-market philosophy.

In financial economics, the black swan theory is based on the significance and unpredictability of special causes.

==Importance to industrial and quality management==
A special-cause failure is a failure that can be corrected by changing a component or process, whereas a common-cause failure is equivalent to noise in the system and specific actions cannot be made to prevent the failure.

Harry Alpert observed: Alpert recognises that there is a temptation to react to an extreme outcome and to see it as significant, even where its causes are common to many situations and the distinctive circumstances surrounding its occurrence, the results of mere chance. Such behaviour has many implications within management, often leading to ad hoc interventions that merely increase the level of variation and frequency of undesirable outcomes.

Deming and Shewhart both advocated the control chart as a means of managing a business process in an economically efficient manner.

==Importance to statistics==
===Deming and Shewhart===
Within the frequency probability framework, there is no process whereby a probability can be attached to the future occurrence of special cause. One might naively ask whether the Bayesian approach does allow such a probability to be specified. The existence of special-cause variation led Keynes and Deming to an interest in Bayesian probability, but no formal synthesis emerged from their work. Most statisticians of the Shewhart-Deming school take the view that special causes are not embedded in either experience or in current thinking (that&#x27;s why they come as a surprise; their prior probability has been neglected—in effect, assigned the value zero) so that any subjective probability is doomed to be hopelessly badly calibrated in practice.

It is immediately apparent from the Leibniz quote above that there are implications for sampling. Deming observed that in any forecasting activity, the population is that of future events while the sampling frame is, inevitably, some subset of historical events. Deming held that the disjoint nature of population and sampling frame was inherently problematic once the existence of special-cause variation was admitted, rejecting the general use of probability and conventional statistics in such
situations. He articulated the difficulty as the distinction between analytic and enumerative statistical studies.

Shewhart argued that, as processes subject to special-cause variation were inherently unpredictable, the usual techniques of probability could not be used to separate special-cause from common-cause variation. He developed the control chart as a statistical heuristic to distinguish the two types of variation. Both Deming and Shewhart advocated the control chart as a means of assessing a process&#x27;s state of statistical control and as a foundation for forecasting.

===Keynes===
Keynes identified three domains of probability:

*frequency probability;
*subjective or Bayesian probability; and
*events lying outside the possibility of any description in terms of probability (special causes)

and sought to base a probability theory thereon.

==Common mode failure in engineering==

Common mode failure has a more specific meaning in engineering. It refers to events which are not statistically independent. Failures in multiple parts of a system may be caused by a single fault, particularly random failures due to environmental conditions or aging. An example is when all of the pumps for a fire sprinkler system are located in one room. If the room becomes too hot for the pumps to operate, they will all fail at essentially the same time, from one cause (the heat in the room). Another example is an electronic system wherein a fault in a power supply injects noise onto a supply line, causing failures in multiple subsystems.

This is particularly important in safety-critical systems using multiple redundant channels. If the probability of failure in one subsystem is &quot;p&quot;, then it would be expected that an &quot;N&quot; channel system would have a probability of failure of &quot;p&quot;&quot;N&quot;. However, in practice, the probability of failure is much higher because they are not statistically independent; for example ionizing radiation or electromagnetic interference (EMI) may affect all the channels.

The &quot;principle of redundancy&quot; states that, when events of failure of a component are statistically independent, the probabilities of their joint occurrence multiply. Thus, for instance, if the probability of failure of a component of a system is one in one thousand per year, the probability of the joint failure of two of them is one in one million per year, provided that the two events are statistically independent. This principle favors the strategy of the redundancy of components. One place this strategy is implemented is in RAID 1, where two hard disks store a computer&#x27;s data redundantly.

But even so, a system can have many common modes of failure. For example, consider the common modes of failure of a RAID1 where two disks are purchased from an online store and installed in a computer:

* The disks are likely to be from the same manufacturer and of the same model, therefore they share the same design flaws.
* The disks are likely to have similar serial numbers, thus they may share any manufacturing flaws affecting production of the same batch.
* The disks are likely to have been shipped at the same time, thus they are likely to have suffered from the same transportation damage.
* As installed both disks are attached to the same power supply, making them vulnerable to the same power supply issues.
* As installed both disks are in the same case, making them vulnerable to the same overheating events.
* They will be both attached to the same card or motherboard, and driven by the same software, which may have the same bugs.
* Because of the very nature of RAID1, both disks will be subjected to the same workload and very closely similar access patterns, stressing them in the same way.

Also, if the events of failure of two components are maximally statistically dependent, the probability of the joint failure of both is identical to the probability of failure of them individually. In such a case, the advantages of redundancy are negated. Strategies for the avoidance of common mode failures include keeping redundant components physically isolated.

A prime example of redundancy with isolation is a nuclear power plant. The new ABWR has three divisions of Emergency Core Cooling Systems, each with its own generators and pumps and each isolated from the others. The new European Pressurized Reactor has two containment buildings, one inside the other. However, even here it is possible for a common mode failure to occur (for example, in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, mains power was severed by the Tōhoku earthquake, then the thirteen backup diesel generators were all simultaneously disabled by the subsequent tsunami that flooded the basements of the turbine halls).

<doc id="435406" wikidata="Q193487" url="?curid=435406" title="Antonov An-124 Ruslan">
<text>The Antonov An-124 Ruslan (; ; NATO reporting name: Condor) is a large, strategic airlift, four-engined aircraft that was designed in the 1980s by the Antonov design bureau in the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union (USSR). The An-124 is the world&#x27;s second heaviest gross weight production cargo airplane and heaviest operating cargo aircraft, behind the destroyed one-off Antonov An-225 Mriya (a greatly enlarged design based on the An-124). The An-124 remains the largest military transport aircraft in service.

In 1971, design work commenced on the project, which was initially referred to as &quot;Izdeliye 400&quot; (&quot;Product #400&quot;), at the Antonov Design Bureau in response to a shortage in heavy airlift capability within the Military Transport Aviation Command (&quot;Komandovaniye voyenno-transportnoy aviatsii&quot; or VTA) arm of the Soviet Air Forces. Two separate final assembly lines plants setup for the aircraft, one at Aviastar-SP (ex. Ulyanovsk Aviation Industrial Complex) in Ulyanovsk, Russia and the other was the Kyiv Aviation Plant AVIANT, in Ukraine. Assembly of the first aircraft begun in 1979; the An-124 (which was sometimes referred to as the &quot;An-40&quot; in the West) performed its maiden flight on 24 December 1982. The type made its first appearance in the Western world at the 1985 Paris Air Show. Viktor Tolmachev was the Chief engineer of An-124 and An-225. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, commercial operations were quickly pursued for the An-124, leading to civil certification being obtained by Antonov on 30 December 1992. Various commercial operators opted to purchase the type, often acquiring refurbished ex-military airlifters or stored fuselages rather than new-build aircraft.

By July 2013, 26 An-124s were reportedly in commercial service while a further ten airlifters were on order. During 2008, it was announced that Russia and Ukraine were to jointly resume production of the type. At one point, it looked as if Russia would order 20 new-build airlifters. However, in August 2014, it was reported that the planned resumption of manufacturing had been shelved due to the ongoing political tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The sole remaining production facility is Russia&#x27;s Aviastar-SP in Ulyanovsk. The various operators of the An-124 are in discussions with respect to the continuing airworthiness certification of the individual An-124 planes. The original designer of the An-124 is responsible for managing the certification process for its own products, but the Russia-Ukraine conflicts are making this process difficult to manage. In 2019, there were 26 An-124s in commercial service.

==Development==
===Background===
During the 1970s, the Military Transport Aviation Command (&quot;Komandovaniye voyenno-transportnoy aviatsii&quot; or VTA) arm of the Soviet Air Forces had a shortfall in strategic heavy airlift capacity. Its largest aircraft consisted of about 50 Antonov An-22 turboprops, which were used heavily for tactical roles. A declassified 1975 CIA analysis concluded that the USSR did &quot;...not match the US in ability to provide long-range heavy lift support.&quot; Soviet officials sought not only additional airlifters, a substantial increase in payload capacity was also desirable so that the same task could be completed with fewer trips.
In 1971, design work on the project commenced at the Antonov Design Bureau; the lead designer of the An-124 (and the enlarged An-225 derivative) was Viktor Tolmachev. During development, it was known as &quot;Izdeliye 400&quot; (&quot;Product #400&quot;) in house, and &quot;An-40&quot; in the West. The design produced broadly resembled the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, an American strategic airlifter, but also incorporated numerous improvements, the greater use of carbon-fibre composites in its construction (comprising around 5% of the aircraft&#x27;s total weight) and the more extensive use of titanium being amongst these benefits. Aluminium alloys make up the primary material used in its construction, limited use of steel and titanium alloys were also made. Unlike the C-5, it lacks a fully-pressurised cargo bay or the ability to receive fuel in-flight.

In 1973, the construction of the necessary facilities to produce the new airlifter began. Two separate final assembly lines plants were established to produce the airlifter: the company Aviastar-SP (ex. Ulyanovsk Aviation Industrial Complex) in Ulyanovsk, Russia and by the Kyiv Aviation Plant AVIANT, in Ukraine. Furthermore, the programme used components, systems, and various other elements drawn from in excess of 100 factories across the Eastern world. In 1979, manufacturing activity on the first airframe began.

On 24 December 1982, the type performed its maiden flight. Three years later, the An-124 made its first appearance in the Western world when an example was displayed at the 1985 Paris Air Show. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, commercial operations of the An-124 became an increasingly important area of activity; to this end, civil certification was sought for the type by Antonov; this was issued on 30 December 1992.

===Post-Soviet developments===
Sales of the An-124 to various commercial operators proceeded throughout the 1990s and into the mid 2000s; many of these were former military aircraft that were refurbished by Antonov prior to delivery, or unfinished fuselages that had been preserved, rather than producing new-build aircraft. During the early 2000s, the cargo operator Volga-Dnepr opted to upgrade its An-124 freighter fleet, these works included engine modifications to conform with chapter four noise regulations, various structural improvements that increased service life, and numerous avionics and systems changes to facilitate four person operations, reducing the crew needed from six or seven.

During April 2008, it was announced that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to resume the production of the An-124 in the third quarter of 2008. One month later, a new variant — the An-124-150 — was announced; it featured several improvements, including a maximum lift capacity of 150 tonnes. However, in May 2009, Antonov&#x27;s partner, the Russian United Aircraft Corporation announced it did not plan to produce any An-124s in the period 2009–2012. During late 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered production of the aircraft resumed; at this point, Russia was expected to procure 20 new-build An-124s. In August 2014, Jane&#x27;s reported that, Russian Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Yuri Slusar announced that production of the An-124 had been stopped as a consequence of the ongoing political tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

In late 2017, multiple An-124s were upgraded by the Aviastar-SP plant in Ulyanovsk, Russia, three of which were reportedly scheduled to return to flight during the following year. As Russia–Ukraine relations continued to sour, Antonov begun to source new suppliers while also pushing to westernize the An-124. During 2018, the American engine manufacturer GE Aviation was studying reengining it with CF6s for CargoLogicAir, a Volga-Dnepr subsidiary. It was believed that this would likely provide a range increase; as Volga-Dnepr Group operated 12 aircraft, the change would imply purchasing between 50 and 60 engines with spares. The Russian engine specialist Aviadvigatel also indicated that a further development of its PD-14, which was intended for use on an upgraded model of the Russian-manufactured An-124, designated PD-35, generated 50% more power than the present Ukrainian Progress D-18T engines.

During January 2019, Antonov revealed its plans to restart production of the An-124 without support from Russia.

===Russian replacement design===
At MAKS Air Show in 2017, the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) announced its An-124-102 Slon (Elephant) design to replace the similar An-124-100. The design was detailed in January 2019 before wind tunnel testing scheduled for August–September. It is intended to be produced at the Aviastar-SP factory in Ulyanovsk. It should transport over (up from ), or over at . The Russian MoD wants a range of with five Sprut-SDM-1 light tanks, their 100 crew and 300 armed soldiers.

The planned An-124-102 is larger at 82.3 m (270 ft) long from , with an span versus and high compared with . A new higher aspect ratio, composite wing and a airframe would allow a gross weight. It should be powered by Russian PD-35s developed for the CR929 widebody, producing up from . Two fuselages are planned, one for Volga-Dnepr with a width of from the An-124&#x27;s , and one for the Russian MoD of wide to carry vehicles in two lines.

On 5 November 2019, the TsAGI released pictures of a long and wide model, ahead of windtunnel testing. On 26 March 2020, TsAGI released new pictures of a wind tunnel model, announcing that the researchers of the Institute had completed the first cycle of aerodynamic testing; the results confirmed the characteristics laid down during preliminary studies.

==Design==

The Antonov An-124 Ruslan is a large, strategic airlift, four-engined aircraft. An aircraft with a similar role, it externally bears numerous similarities to the American Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, having a double fuselage to allow for a rear cargo door (on the lower fuselage) that can open in flight without affecting structural integrity, as well as the arrangement of flight control surfaces, such as the slats, flaps, and spoilers, resembling the layout of the C-5. The An-124 has a slightly shorter fuselage, has a slightly greater wingspan, and is capable of carrying a 17 percent larger payload. In place of the C-5&#x27;s T-tail, the An-124 is furnished with a conventional empennage, similar in design to that of the Boeing 747. The An-124 features a fly-by-wire control system. This is a hybrid control system, as it also implements conventional mechanical controls for some aspects; these have been arranged in a manner that provides redundancy against the failure of a single hydraulic circuit.

A single An-124 is capable of carrying up to of cargo internally in a standard military configuration; it can also carry 88 passengers in an upper deck behind the wing centre section. The forward area of this upper deck is where the flight deck and the crew area accommodated; movement between the upper and lower decks is via a pair of foldable internal ladders. The cargo compartment of the An-124 is , ca. 20% larger than the main cargo compartment of the C-5 Galaxy, which is . Largely due to the limited pressurisation of its main cargo compartment (24.6 kPa, 3.57 psi), the airlifter has seldom been used to deploy paratroopers or to carry passengers, as they would typically require oxygen masks and cold-weather clothing in such conditions. In comparison, the upper deck is fully pressurised. The floor of the cargo deck is entirely composed of titanium, a measure that is usually prohibited by the material cost. It is suitable for carrying almost any heavy vehicle, including multiple main battle tanks.

The An-124 is powered by four Lotarev D-18 turbofan engines, each capable of generating up to 238–250 kN of thrust. To reduce the landing distance required, thrust reversers are present. Pilots have stated that the airlifter is relatively light on the controls and is easy to handle for an aircraft of its size. A pair of TA18-200-124 auxiliary power units (APUs) are accommodated within the main landing gear fairings. As a consequence of the heat and blast effects produced by these APUs, some airports require pavement protection to be deployed. The landing gear of the An-124 is outfitted with an oleo strut suspension system for its 24 wheels. This suspension has been calibrated to allow for landing on rough terrain and is able to kneel, which allows for easier loading and unloading via the front cargo door. Other features intended to ease loading including an onboard overhead crane in the cargo deck, capable of lifting up to 30 tonnes, while items up to 120 tonnes can be winched on board. Two separate radar units are typically present, one is intended for ground mapping and navigation purposes, while the other is for weather.

==Operational history==
During the 2000s, Germany headed an initiative to lease An-124s for NATO strategic airlift requirements. Two aircraft were leased from SALIS GmbH as a stopgap until the Airbus A400M became available. Under NATO SALIS programme NAMSA is chartering six An-124-100 transport aircraft. According to the contract An-124-100s of Antonov Airlines and Volga-Dnepr are used within the limits of NATO SALIS programme to transport cargo by requests of 18 countries: Belgium, Hungary, Greece, Denmark, Canada, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Finland, France, Germany, Czech Republic and Sweden. Two An-124-100s are constantly based on full-time charter in the Leipzig/Halle airport, but the contract specifies that if necessary, two more aircraft will be provided at six days&#x27; notice and another two at nine days&#x27; notice. The aircraft proved extremely useful for NATO especially with operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
United Launch Alliance (ULA) contracts the An-124 to transport the Atlas V launch vehicle from its facilities in Decatur, Alabama to Cape Canaveral. ULA also uses the An-124 to transport the Atlas V launch vehicle and Centaur upper stage from their manufacturing facility in Denver, Colorado to Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Space Force Base. Two flights are required to transfer each launch vehicle (one for the Atlas V main booster stage and another for the Centaur upper stage). It is also contracted by Space Systems Loral to transport satellites from Palo Alto, CA to the Arianespace spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana and by SpaceX to transport payload fairings between their factory in Hawthorne, California and Cape Canaveral.

By 2013, the An-124 had reportedly visited 768 airports in over 100 countries.

By late 2020, three civil operators of the An-124 remained. Antonov Airlines with seven aircraft, Volga-Dnepr Airlines with 12, and Maximus Air Cargo with one. In November 2020, Volga-Dnepr reported that it was indefinitely grounding its fleet of An-124 aircraft to inspect the 60 engines (including spares) following the 13 November 2020 unconfined engine failure at Novosibirsk. As of 29 December 2020, the first Volga-Dnepr An-124-100 was back in service.

<text>The governor of Gibraltar is the representative of the British monarch in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. The governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the British government. The role of the governor is to act as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of state. They are responsible for formally appointing the chief minister of Gibraltar, along with other members of the government of Gibraltar after a general election. The governor serves as commander-in-chief of Gibraltar&#x27;s military forces and has sole responsibility for defence and security. Although recent appointments have all been former military personnel, most being former Royal Navy or Royal Marines flag officers, Sir James Dutton resigned from the role in 2015, complaining that it was &quot;more representational and ceremonial than I had expected&quot;.

The governor has his own flag in Gibraltar, the Union Flag defaced with the territory&#x27;s coat of arms. However, at the governor&#x27;s official residence (&quot;The Convent&quot;), the Union Flag and the flag of Gibraltar are also flown.

<doc id="435420" wikidata="Q181713" url="?curid=435420" title="Anaerobic respiration">
<text>Anaerobic respiration is respiration using electron acceptors other than molecular oxygen (O2). Although oxygen is not the final electron acceptor, the process still uses a respiratory electron transport chain.

In aerobic organisms undergoing respiration, electrons are shuttled to an electron transport chain, and the final electron acceptor is oxygen. Molecular oxygen is an excellent electron acceptor. Anaerobes instead use less-oxidizing substances such as nitrate (), fumarate (), sulfate (), or elemental sulfur (S). These terminal electron acceptors have smaller reduction potentials than O2. Less energy per oxidized molecule is released. Therefore, anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic.

== As compared with fermentation ==

Anaerobic cellular respiration and fermentation generate ATP in very different ways, and the terms should not be treated as synonyms. Cellular respiration (both aerobic and anaerobic) uses highly reduced chemical compounds such as NADH and FADH2 (for example produced during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle) to establish an electrochemical gradient (often a proton gradient) across a membrane. This results in an electrical potential or ion concentration difference across the membrane. The reduced chemical compounds are oxidized by a series of respiratory integral membrane proteins with sequentially increasing reduction potentials, with the final electron acceptor being oxygen (in aerobic respiration) or another chemical substance (in anaerobic respiration). A proton motive force drives protons down the gradient (across the membrane) through the proton channel of ATP synthase. The resulting current drives ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate. 

Fermentation, in contrast, does not use an electrochemical gradient but instead uses only substrate-level phosphorylation to produce ATP. The electron acceptor NAD+ is regenerated from NADH formed in oxidative steps of the fermentation pathway by the reduction of oxidized compounds. These oxidized compounds are often formed during the fermentation pathway itself, but may also be external. For example, in homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is oxidized back to NAD+ by the reduction of pyruvate to lactic acid at a later stage in the pathway. In yeast, acetaldehyde is reduced to ethanol to regenerate NAD+.

There are two important anaerobic microbial methane formation pathways, through carbon dioxide / bicarbonate () reduction (respiration) or acetate fermentation.

==Ecological importance==

Anaerobic respiration is a critical component of the global nitrogen, iron, sulfur, and carbon cycles through the reduction of the oxyanions of nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon to more-reduced compounds. The biogeochemical cycling of these compounds, which depends upon anaerobic respiration, significantly impacts the carbon cycle and global warming. Anaerobic respiration occurs in many environments, including freshwater and marine sediments, soil, subsurface aquifers, deep subsurface environments, and biofilms. Even environments that contain oxygen, such as soil, have micro-environments that lack oxygen due to the slow diffusion characteristics of oxygen gas.

An example of the ecological importance of anaerobic respiration is the use of nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor, or dissimilatory denitrification, which is the main route by which fixed nitrogen is returned to the atmosphere as molecular nitrogen gas. The denitrification process is also very important in host-microbe interactions. Like mitochondria in oxygen-respiring microorganisms, some single-cellular anaerobic ciliates use denitrifying endosymbionts to gain energy. Another example is methanogenesis, a form of carbon-dioxide respiration, that is used to produce methane gas by anaerobic digestion. Biogenic methane can be a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. However, uncontrolled methanogenesis in landfill sites releases large amounts of methane into the atmosphere, acting as a potent greenhouse gas. Sulfate respiration produces hydrogen sulfide, which is responsible for the characteristic &#x27;rotten egg&#x27; smell of coastal wetlands and has the capacity to precipitate heavy metal ions from solution, leading to the deposition of sulfidic metal ores.

==Economic relevance==

Dissimilatory denitrification is widely used in the removal of nitrate and nitrite from municipal wastewater. An excess of nitrate can lead to eutrophication of waterways into which treated water is released. Elevated nitrite levels in drinking water can lead to problems due to its toxicity. Denitrification converts both compounds into harmless nitrogen gas.

Specific types of anaerobic respiration are also critical in bioremediation, which uses microorganisms to convert toxic chemicals into less-harmful molecules to clean up contaminated beaches, aquifers, lakes, and oceans. For example, toxic arsenate or selenate can be reduced to less toxic compounds by various anaerobic bacteria via anaerobic respiration. The reduction of chlorinated chemical pollutants, such as vinyl chloride and carbon tetrachloride, also occurs through anaerobic respiration.

Anaerobic respiration is useful in generating electricity in microbial fuel cells, which employ bacteria that respire solid electron acceptors (such as oxidized iron) to transfer electrons from reduced compounds to an electrode. This process can simultaneously degrade organic carbon waste and generate electricity.

<doc id="435422" wikidata="Q674842" url="?curid=435422" title="Marquess of Donegall">
<text>Marquess of Donegall is a title in the Peerage of Ireland held by the head of the Chichester family, originally from Devon, England. Sir John Chichester sat as a Member of Parliament and was High Sheriff of Devon in 1557. One of his sons, Sir Arthur Chichester, was Lord Deputy of Ireland from 1605 to 1616. In 1613, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Chichester, of Belfast in County Antrim. When he died childless in 1625 the barony became extinct.

However, in the same year the Chichester title was revived in favour of his younger brother, Edward Chichester, who was made Baron Chichester, of Belfast in the County of Antrim, and Viscount Chichester, of Carrickfergus in County Antrim. Both titles are in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Arthur Chichester. A distinguished soldier, he was created Earl of Donegall in the Peerage of Ireland in 1647 (one year before he succeeded his father), with remainder to the heirs male of his father.

He died without male issue and was succeeded (in the earldom according to the special remainder) by his nephew Arthur Chichester, the second Earl. He was the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel John Chichester, second son of the first Viscount. Lord Donegall had previously represented County Donegal in the Irish House of Commons. His eldest son, the third Earl, was a Major-General in the Spanish army and fought in the War of the Spanish Succession. He was killed in action in 1706. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. John Chichester, younger son of the third Earl. Lord Donegall was created Baron Fisherwick, of Fisherwick in the County of Stafford, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1790, and one year later he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Belfast and Marquess of Donegall in the Peerage of Ireland.

His grandson, the third Marquess, served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard under Lord John Russell between 1848 and 1852. In 1841, three years before he succeeded his father in the marquessate, he was created Baron Ennishowen and Carrickfergus, of Ennishowen in the County of Donegal and of Carrickfergus in the County of Antrim, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Both his sons predeceased him and on his death in 1883 the barony of 1841 became extinct. He was succeeded in his other titles by his younger brother, the fourth Marquess. On the death of his grandson, the sixth Marquess, in 1975, the line of the second Marquess failed. The sixth Marquess was succeeded by his kinsman, the fifth Baron Templemore (see below), who became the seventh Marquess. From 1790 until 1999, when most hereditary seats were abolished with the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, the Marquess sat in the House of Lords as Baron Fisherwick in the Peerage of Great Britain. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, the eighth Marquess, who succeeded in 2007.

The county in Ulster from which the title is derived is now spelt &quot;Donegal&quot;. Several locations in Belfast are named after the family, such as Donegall Square, Donegall Place, Donegall Road, Donegall Pass, Donegall Quay, Chichester Street, Arthur Street, Arthur Square, and Chichester Park.

==Chichester family==
Several other members of the Chichester family have also gained distinction. John Chichester, grandson of Sir John Chichester, brother of the first Baron Chichester and the first Viscount Chichester, was created a baronet in 1641 (see Chichester baronets). John Chichester, second son of the first Viscount and father of the second Earl, represented Dungannon in the Irish House of Commons. For the branch of the family founded by John Chichester&#x27;s younger son and namesake, John Chichester, see Baron O&#x27;Neill and Baron Rathcavan.

Arthur Chichester, eldest son of Lord Spencer Chichester, third son of the first Marquess, was created Baron Templemore in 1831. Lord Arthur Chichester, fourth son of the second Marquess, and Lord John Chichester, sixth son of the second Marquess, both represented Belfast in Parliament. Robert Chichester, eldest son of Lord Adolphus Chichester, youngest son of the fourth Marquess, briefly represented Londonderry South in Parliament. His wife Dehra was also a politician while their daughter, Marion Caroline Dehra, was the mother of James Chichester-Clark, Baron Moyola, who served briefly as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, and the politician Sir Robin Chichester-Clark and of the gardening writer and television presenter Penelope Hobhouse.

==Family seats==

===Ulster and Dublin===
The &quot;caput&quot;, or family seat, has been in several locations over the centuries, usually in the east of Ulster. Joymount House was built for the 1st Baron Chichester in the 1610s in Carrickfergus in the south-east of County Antrim, probably being completed in 1618. Joymount, along with Chichester House on the outskirts of Dublin and the Plantation-era Belfast Castle in Belfast, were the three original principal residences of the Chichester family in Ireland. Lord Chichester maintained Chichester House, located on the Hoggen Green (now College Green), as his &#x27;town&#x27; residence on what was then the eastern edge of Dublin. Joymount House was probably demolished in the early eighteenth century, while Parliament House was built on the site of Chichester House in Dublin in the early 1730s. The Plantation-era Belfast Castle was largely destroyed by fire on 24 April 1708 and was not rebuilt.

In the early to mid-nineteenth-century, the family seats were: Donegall House, a large townhouse on the corner of what is now Donegall Place and Donegall Square North in central Belfast (Donegall House was later converted, in the 1820s, into a hotel called The Royal Hotel); and Ormeau House (formerly Ormeau Cottage), a mansion largely built in the 1820s in the Ormeau Demesne (now Ormeau Park) in County Down, in what was then the south-eastern outskirts of Belfast. Both these residences were later demolished, with Ormeau House being demolished in 1869 or 1870.

The 2nd Marquess of Donegall, again during the early to mid-nineteenth-century, also maintained Fisherwick Lodge, a hunting &#x27;lodge&#x27; near Doagh in County Antrim, on the family&#x27;s country estate there. Later in the nineteenth-century, Belfast Castle, on the lower slopes of Cave Hill in North Belfast, was purpose-designed and built for the 3rd Marquess of Donegall as the main residence of the family. This new Belfast Castle, a Victorian structure built in the 1860s, was inherited by the 8th Earl of Shaftesbury and his wife in October 1883, thus passing out of the ownership of the Chichester family. Lord Shaftesbury had married the daughter of the third Marquess.

===County Wexford===
From October 1953 until about 1996, Dunbrody House, formerly the seat of the Barons Templemore near Arthurstown in the south-west of County Wexford, was the family seat of the 7th Marquess of Donegall. From October 1953 until May 1975, the seventh Marquess was known as The 5th Baron Templemore. Arthurstown was named for the 1st Earl of Donegall. The house was sold by the seventh Marquess to chef Kevin Dundon, who converted it into a luxury hotel and restaurant in 1997. What remains of the Dunbrody Estate is, however, still in the ownership of the current head of the family, The 8th Marquess of Donegall, whose present family seat is the much smaller Dunbrody Park within the estate grounds.

<doc id="435427" wikidata="Q929300" url="?curid=435427" title="Saif al-Adel">
<text>Mohamed Salah al-Din al-Halim Zaidan (; born April 11, 1960), commonly known by his &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Saif al-Adel (), is a former Egyptian Army officer, explosives expert, and the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of al-Qaeda. Al-Adel fought the Soviets as an Afghan Arab before becoming a founding member of the al-Qaeda organization. He is a member of al-Qaeda&#x27;s &quot;Majlis al-Shura&quot; and has headed the organization&#x27;s military committee since the death of Mohammed Atef in 2001. He is currently known to live in Iran along with several other senior members of the group.

Once a colonel in Egypt&#x27;s El-Sa&#x27;ka Forces during the 1980s, the Egyptian military expelled al-Adel in 1987 and arrested him alongside thousands of Islamists amid allegations of attempting to rebuild the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and plans to topple Hosni Mubarak. The charges were dismissed, though al-Adel soon left Egypt for Afghanistan, joining Afghan Arab mujahideen resisting the Soviet invasion under the banner of al-Qaeda forerunner Maktab al-Khidamat in 1988. al-Adel would go on to become the chief of newly formed al-Qaeda&#x27;s media department, and was involved in the production of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s videos which quickly found audiences worldwide. By the early nineties, al-Adel is thought to have then traveled to southern Lebanon with Abu Talha al-Sudani, Saif al-Islam al-Masri, Abu Ja`far al-Masri, and Abu Salim al-Masri, where they trained alongside Hezbollah Al-Hejaz. Sometime after, al-Adel became a member of the AQ Shura council, and by 1992 had become a member of its military committee, then headed by Muhammad Atef. He has provided military and intelligence training to members of al-Qaeda and Egyptian Islamic Jihad in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sudan, and to anti-American Somali tribes. Shifting to Khartoum in 1992, al-Adel taught militant recruits how to handle explosives. It is possible that his trainees included Somalis who participated in the first Battle of Mogadishu in 1993. al-Adel also established the al-Qaeda training facility at Ras Kamboni in Somalia near the Kenyan border.

The 9/11 Commission Report states that in July 2001, three senior AQ Shura council members including al-Adel, Saeed al-Masri, and Mahfouz Ould al-Walid opposed bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri&#x27;s decision to execute the September 11 attacks. Following the subsequent US invasion of Afghanistan, al-Adel was given secret asylum in Iran during which he was monitored by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In 2015, al-Qaeda made a deal with the IRGC&#x27;s Qods Force to return Saif to Afghanistan, though he reportedly refused, stating a preference for maintaining Iran as his base of activities. al-Adel is currently under indictment in the United States, with charges related to his alleged role in the 1998 US Embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya.

Before Zawahiri&#x27;s assassination in 2022, Saif al-Adel had become the effective micro-manager of field commanders of AQ branches in Somalia, Yemen and Syria from his communication base in Iran. A 2023 United Nations report concluded that al-Adel had been named &quot;de facto&quot; leader of al-Qaeda but that he had not been formally proclaimed as its emir due to &quot;political sensitives&quot; of the Taliban government in acknowledging the killing of Zawahiri in Kabul and the &quot;theological and operational&quot; challenges posed by location of al-Adel in Shia-led Iran. With the death of Zawahiri, Saif al-Adel is one of al-Qaeda&#x27;s few surviving founding members. al-Adel has been tightening his grip over the AQ branches, promoting a loyalist base of field commanders and increasing his influence in the group&#x27;s branch in the Arabian Peninsula, known as AQAP, while waiting to be officially declared emir. Saif has made attempts to shift AQ&#x27;s central command to Yemen, a country where the group has long had a branch.

==Early life==

al-Adel was born around 1960 (the FBI claims April 11), joining the Egyptian Armed Forces around 1976 and became a colonel in the El-Sa&#x27;ka Forces by the 80&#x27;s as an explosives expert, possibly being trained in the Soviet Union. He fled Egypt in 1988 and made his way to Afghanistan, joining the relatively small but well funded (and mainly Egyptian and Saudi) Maktab al-Khidamat, the forerunner to what would become al-Qaeda. He became an explosives trainer for new recruits, and would stay in Afghanistan after the war to train members of the newly formed Taliban. The late emir of Somali al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab, Ahmed Godane, stated that al-Adel and future al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia leader Yusuf al-Ayiri played an important role in the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu by providing training and participating in the battle directly against American forces. Al-Adel would later join Osama bin Laden in Sudan after 1994.

=== Real identity ===
Until 2012, there was much dispute over al-Adel&#x27;s real name and identity. According to the University of Exeter professor Omar Ashour, the FBI&#x27;s previous information on al-Adel had confused the biographies of two different members of al-Qaeda; &#x27;Mohamed Salah al-Din al-Halim Zaidan&#x27; and &#x27;Muhammad Ibrahim al-Makkawi&#x27;. Ashour states that imagery of al-Adel in FBI &quot;Most Wanted List&quot; depicts Zaidan and asserts that like Makkawi, Zaidan was also a colonel of the Egyptian military. As of present, most intelligence agencies and analysts today confirm that al-Adel&#x27;s real identity is that of Zaidan&#x27;s. Makkawi was arrested by the Egyptian police on 29 February 2012 upon arrival at Cairo Airport from Pakistan. During interrogation, Makkawi denied that he was al-Adel and claimed that he splintered his affiliation with the organization in 1989. By the time of his arrest, Makkawi had been married in Pakistan and had a family there, and was reportedly distressed to see his name being promoted under the image of Saif al-Adel. An Egyptian lawyer asserted that Makkawi was an Egyptian military officer who was arrested in 1980s over ties to jihadist organizations. He later escaped to Afghanistan and became a member of al-Qaeda. However, the lawyer also claimed that Makkawi was a different person from Saif al-Adel and had severed ties with al-Qaeda long ago. The real al-Adel, currently based in Iran, was a supervisor of Bin Laden&#x27;s personal security and has been described as an &quot;experienced professional soldier&quot; within the jihadist movement. Noman Benotman, a former leader of the al-Qaeda-linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, stated that he had met both Makkawi and al-Adel. Some analysts believe that al-Adel may have once used Makkawi&#x27;s name as an alias.

==Militant connections==

=== Embassy bombings ===
Several months before the 1998 embassy bombings, al-Adel was helping Osama bin Laden move his followers from Najim Jihad to Tarnak Farms. The group had begrudgingly agreed to care for the troublesome Canadian 16-year-old, Abdurahman Khadr, since his father was away and his mother couldn&#x27;t control his drinking, smoking and violent outbursts. However, while they were in Kabul, bin Laden asked Adel to take Abdurahman to the bus station and send him back to his family&#x27;s home.

In approximately 2000, Adel was living in the Karte Parwan district of Kabul. On the local walkie-talkie communications in the city, he was identified as #1. On 9 September 2001, Adel was approached by Feroz Ali Abbasi, who said he was so impressed by the killing of Ahmed Shah Massoud that he wanted to volunteer for something similar.

In early November 2001, the Taliban government announced they were bestowing official Afghan citizenship on Adel, as well as Bin Laden, Zawahiri, Mohammed Atef, and Shaykh Asim Abdulrahman. During the American bombardment of Kandahar, Adel was present and witnessed the deaths of Abu-Ali al-Yafi&#x27;i and his wife, Abu-Usamah al-Ta&#x27;zi with his wife and two children, the wife of Rayyan al-Ta&#x27;zi, the wife of Abu-Usamah al-Kini, and the wife of Al-Barra al-Hijazi who was arrested in Morocco before the Casablanca bombings.

On 18 November, Adel was working with Abu-Muhammad al-Abyad, Abd-al-Rahman al-Masri, and Abu-Usamah al-Filastini, Abu-Husayn al-Masri and Faruq al-Suri; all of whom were staying in his empty house with him at night. In the early morning hours of 19 November, he woke them up just minutes before the al-Wafa charity building was bombed. Phoning friends in the area, he learned that Abdul Wahid had been killed in the explosion. He later learned that Asim al-Yamani, from Al Farouq training camp, and the elderly Abu-Abd-al-Rahman Al-Abiy had run to the charity&#x27;s headquarters and begun rescuing survivors and pulling out the dead bodies. The pair agreed the area was not safe, and sent their women to the smaller villages, while they used their two cars to try and pack up their house&#x27;s contents. An American jet bombed the pair, killing al-Yamani and wounding al-Abiy.

As it was the third day of Ramadan, the group in Adel&#x27;s house began to prepare and eat Suhoor, but were interrupted by a cruise missile striking 100 metres away, destroying an empty house belonging to an Afghan Arab family, and a Taliban barracks. They gathered their belongings and quickly left, fearing another strike. Adel went to the hospital, where he visited the wounded al-Abiy, and arranged for him to be transferred to a hospital in Pakistan.

After Adel was told by Abu Ali al-Suri that the American aircraft had machinegunned women leaving the city on the road to Banjway, Adel said that he would send aid. A convoy of 4–6 Corolla Fielders set out to Banjway, followed closely by American helicopters. The Americans attacked the lead vehicle, killing Abu-Ali al-Yafi&#x27;i, his wife, four women, and two children, and the second vehicle, killing Suraqah al-Yamani and Hamzah al-Suri. Abu-Ali al-Maliki quickly veered off the road with the third vehicle, turning off his headlights, and drove into the mountains, escaping the attack.

Since al-Qaeda&#x27;s military chief Mohammed Atef was killed in 2001, journalists reported that Adel was likely his successor in that role.

===Pearl kidnapping===
Since 2011, he has been connected with the kidnapping of Daniel Pearl in 2002.

===2003 Riyadh bombing===
Al-Adel and Saad bin Laden were implicated in the 12 May 2003 suicide bombing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In May 2003, then-State Department official Ryan Crocker provided information on the upcoming attack to Iranian officials, who apparently took no action. However, according to Saad&#x27;s family and an interrogation of former al-Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Saad and al-Adel were being held prisoner in Iran when the attack took place. In 2004, he published a &quot;terrorist manual&quot; entitled &quot;The Base of the Vanguard&quot;, an Arabic pun on the phrases &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; (&quot;the base&quot;) and the Vanguards of Conquest.

Al-Adel was a key source in a 2005 book on al-Qaeda&#x27;s global strategy by the journalist Fouad Hussein.

Al-Adel is a leader of al-Qaeda in Iran, according to American security expert Seth Jones.

==Current location==
According to multiple Western news agencies, Saif al-Adel is currently based in Iran, since the 2000s. Following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, Saif al-Adel was given secret asylum in Iran during which he was monitored by the IRGC. As an ideologue who favoured engagement with Iran to jointly promote anti-American revolutions in the region, this and the constant US-led accusations of Iran and al-Qaeda&#x27;s cooperation is seen as an attempt to unite their enemies into one entity, even going as far as to claim that Sayf al-Adel had a friendship with IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani when al-Qaeda was actively fighting forces under his command in Syria. Due to the publication of an article by al-Qaeda media Global Islamic Media Front Adel&#x27;s location is speculated to have moved to Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover in 2021, since the article included a lot of praise for the newly established emirate which Adel urged all Muslims to migrate to. Adel has been on the FBI&#x27;s list of Most Wanted Terrorists since its inception in 2001. The State Department&#x27;s Rewards for Justice Program is offering up to US$10 million for information on his location.

In late 2001, Adel fled Afghanistan to Iran and was detained under house arrest in Tehran. Later reports indicated that he was released by Iran in March 2010 in exchange for the release of Heshmatollah Attarzadeh, an Iranian diplomat kidnapped in November 2008, and made his way to northern Pakistan. Although Mahfouz Ould al-Walid was reported killed in a January 2002 American airstrike, it was later revealed that he fled to Iran with Adel.

In October 2010, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported that Adel was in the Waziristan region in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas between Northwest Frontier Province, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

In July 2011, it was reported that Adel returned to Iran.

Egyptian authorities reported in 2012 that he was arrested at the Cairo International Airport upon his return to Egypt from Pakistan via the United Arab Emirates. However, according to Ghaith, al-Adel never left Iran and was still under house arrest when Ghaith was captured in 2013.

On 20 September 2015, Al Arabiya reported that al-Adel and four other captives were part of a prisoner exchange Iranian authorities made with AQAP in Yemen.

On 16 March 2016, a Twitter account affiliated with al-Qaeda implicated al-Adel as having been sent to aid against the Russian intervention in the Syrian Civil War. A similar report also placed al-Adel as having been sent to Syria as an emissary on behalf of al-Qaeda emir Ayman al-Zawahiri. However, &quot;Long War Journal&quot; reported that al-Adel is still residing in Iran.

On August 2, 2022, a day after it was reported that al-Zawahiri was killed in a U.S. drone strike, al-Adel was still reported to be in Iran, which also complicated his ability to succeed al-Zawahiri as al-Qaeda&#x27;s leader. &quot;NPR&quot; journalist Colin P. Clarke described al-Adel&#x27;s legal status in Iran as &quot;semi-house arrest.&quot; In February 2023, a report from the United Nations, based on member state intelligence, concluded that &quot;de facto&quot; leadership of al-Qaeda had passed to Saif al-Adel.

==Writings==
In February 2006, the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point published a number of declassified documents from the Harmony database, some of which are known or believed to have been written by Saif al-Adel. One is a letter signed &quot;Omar al-Sumali, previously known as Saif al-Adel&quot;, about the author&#x27;s activities in southern Somalia during UNOSOM II (1993–1995). It identifies the southern town of Ras Kamboni as a suitable site for an al-Qaeda base. It mentions an accomplice of Adel called &quot;Mukhtar&quot;.

In a letter from &quot;&#x27;Abd-al-Halim Adl&#x27;&quot; to &quot;&#x27;Mukhtar&#x27;&quot;, dated 13 June 2002, the author strongly criticises the leadership of Osama bin Laden, blaming the defeats of the preceding six months for al-Qaeda on bin Laden&#x27;s recklessness and unwillingness to listen to advice:

From the following section, the 2002 addressee, &quot;&#x27;Mukhtar&#x27;&quot; appears to be Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the commander of the September 11 attacks:

The East Asia, Europe, America, Horn of Africa, Yemen, Gulf, and Morocco groups have fallen, and Pakistan has almost been drowned in one push. I, not to mention the other individuals who have also moved and fallen, have often advised on this matter. Regrettably, my brother, if you look back, you will find that you are the person solely responsible for all this because you undertook the mission, and during six months, we only lost what we built in years.

In 2004, Adel was alleged to be the author of &quot;The al-Battar Military Camp&quot;, a manual that advised prospective militants about how to strike easy targets.

On 11 March 2005, al-Quds al-Arabi published extracts from Adel&#x27;s document, &quot;Al Qaeda&#x27;s Strategy to the Year 2020&quot;. In his May 2005 correspondence to Deputy Emir Ayman al-Zawhiri, Saif al-Adel outlined the key pillars in al-Qaeda&#x27;s revolutionary strategy:

* Decisive Jihadist activities that precisely delineates goals and targets. The ultimate objective is the revival of &quot;Islamic way of life by means of establishing the state of Islam&quot;. This endeavour has to be supervised by qualified Islamic scholars (&quot;ulema&quot;)
* All decisions, objectives and policies should be based on the belief of &quot;Tawhid&quot; (Islamic monotheism)
* Every activity should be implemented on the basis of short-term and long-term strategic visions. Adel writes in his message to Zawahiri: &quot;&quot;mujahidin&quot; should have short-term plans aimed at achieving interim goals and long-term plans aimed at accomplishing the greater objective, which is the establishment of a state.&quot;

March 2007, the Pentagon posted on the Internet a transcript of part of the hearing into the combatant status of detainee Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Some of the evidence against bin al-Shibh came from a diary of Saif al-Adel found in Saudi Arabia in 2004.

The CSRT document described al-Adel by the following:

Sayf al-Adel is a senior Al-Qaeda military commander with a long-term relationship with Osama bin Laden. Sayf al-Adel&#x27;s role in the organization has been as a trainer, military leader, and key member of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s security detail.The diary of Sayf al-Adel was recovered during a raid in Saudi Arabia in 2004. The diary details the Detainee&#x27;s involvement in the 11 September 2001 terrorist plot and subsequent attack.

In addition, the paragraph continued:

The Detainee is listed as a &quot;highly professional jihadist&quot; along with &quot;9/11 hijackers&quot;, Mohammed Atta and Ziad Jarrah. The diary states that the three were briefed on an operation involving aircraft by Abu Hafs, a senior al-Qaeda planner.

In December 2010, Adel allegedly sent a series of five letters to Abu Walid al Masri, then under house arrest in Iran. He discusses the War in Afghanistan, criticises the religious failings of the mujahideen and hypocrisy of Islamic scholars, and the failure of the Jihadist movement to learn from previous mistakes. Al-Masri posted the letters on the Internet in December 2010. In March 2011, Adel allegedly released another five letters through al Masri, which covered the Arab Spring uprisings.

In August 2015, a eulogy written by al-Adel for Abu Khalid al-Suri, an al-Qaeda veteran who served as both a senior figure in the Syrian opposition group Ahrar al-Sham and as Ayman al Zawahiri&#x27;s representative in Syria, was released. In the eulogy he criticized the Islamic State and described them as having &quot;twisted&quot; and &quot;perverted&quot; thoughts.

In September 2024 a book was released online called &quot;Free Reading of 33 Strategies of War&quot;, a commentary on the book of the same name by Robert Greene. For the first time publishing under his real name Muhammad Salah al-Din Zaydan he outlines a radical new strategy for Al-Qaeda and global Jihad. This strategy seems to support a moving away from traditional old-school Jihadi thinking and especially from Sunni-centric focus and seeks to be flexible and build relationships with other Jihadi groups and nation states friendly to their ultimate goal, the destruction of the West. It has since been published on Amazon.

==Personal life==
Adel is married to the daughter of Egyptian Afghan Jihadist and journalist Abu Walid al-Masri. The couple reportedly have five children.

<text>The is a peninsula that encompasses the entirety of Chiba Prefecture on Honshu, the largest island of Japan. It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area. It forms the eastern edge of Tokyo Bay, separating it from the Pacific Ocean. The peninsula covers approximately .

==Description==

The Bōsō Peninsula is defined by the Pacific Ocean to its east and south, Tokyo Bay to the west, and the Edo and Tone rivers to the north. The Bōsō Hill Range forms the backbone of the south of the peninsula, and much of the area is hilly. Mount Atago in Minamibōsō and Kamogawa is the highest point on the peninsula with an altitude of . From south to north the Bōsō Hill Range gives way to the Shimōsa Plateau, which covers much of the area of northern Chiba Prefecture, and ends in the lower areas around the Tone River.

The northern and western parts of the Bōsō Peninsula are highly urbanized. The Shimōsa Plateau and the coastal lowlands and interior river valleys are chiefly used for rice cultivation. The western coast of the peninsula is home to the Keiyō Industrial Zone, which ranges from Urayasu on the border of Tokyo in the northwest of the peninsula to Futtsu to the south. The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, a bridge-tunnel across Tokyo Bay, connects Kisarazu with the city of Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture. The northeast of the peninsula is home to Suigo-Tsukuba Quasi-National Park, which spans across both Ibaraki and Chiba prefectures, and much of the remainder of the eastern coast of the peninsula is designated as Minami Bōsō Quasi-National Park.

==Etymology==

The peninsula gets its name and kanji from the former provinces that were located there: Awa (安房), Kazusa (上総) and Shimōsa (下総). The Japan Meteorological Agency refers to the west and east coasts of the peninsula as &quot;Uchibō&quot; (内房) and &quot;Sotobō&quot; (外房) respectively.

<text>The Landtag of Bavaria, officially known in English as the Bavarian State Parliament, is the unicameral legislature of the German state of Bavaria. The parliament meets in the Maximilianeum in Munich.

Elections to the Landtag are held every five years and have to be conducted on a Sunday or public holiday. The following elections have to be held no earlier than 59 months and no later than 62 months after the previous one, unless the Landtag is dissolved. The most recent elections to the Bavarian Landtag were held on 8 October 2023.

Bavaria&#x27;s current state government, the third Söder cabinet, was formed after the 2023 election and is a coalition of the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Free Voters (FW). An identical coalition was in power as the second Söder cabinet between 2018 and 2023. Markus Söder has been Minister-President of Bavaria since March 2018, when he succeeded Horst Seehofer.

==History==


The &quot;Landtag&quot; of Bavaria was founded in 1818, in the Kingdom of Bavaria. The first assembly was held on 4 February 1819. Originally it was called the &quot;Ständeversammlung&quot; and was divided into an upper house, the &quot;Kammer der Reichsräte&quot; (House of Councillors), and a lower house, the &quot;&quot; (House of Representatives). With the act to reform the election of the representatives in 1848 the &quot;Ständeversammlung&quot; was de facto renamed the &quot;Landtag&quot; (state diet). The name Landtag was used occasionally before this act.

In the Weimar Republic, from 1919 on, under the , the upper house of the &quot;Landtag&quot; was abolished and its lower house became a unicameral democratic elected assembly. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, the &quot;Landtag&quot; underwent &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; like all German state parliaments. It was dissolved on 30 January 1934 as a result of the &quot;Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich&quot;.

After the Second World War, the new Constitution of Bavaria was enacted and the first new &quot;Landtag&quot; elections took place on 1 December 1946. Between 1946 and 1999 there was again an upper house, the Senate of Bavaria. The CSU has dominated the Bavarian &quot;Landtag&quot; for nearly the entire post-war period.

The CSU&#x27;s 2003 election victory was the first time in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany that any party had won a two-thirds majority of seats in an assembly at any level. Five years later in 2008, the CSU saw a stunning reversal of fortunes, and failed to win a majority of seats in Bavaria for the first time in 46 years. In the aftermath of this result, the SPD floated the idea that the four other parties should all unite to form a government excluding the CSU, as it had &quot;lost its mandate to lead&quot;: however, the FDP were not interested, and opted to form a coalition with the CSU.

==Composition==
Like the &quot;Bundestag&quot; at the federal level, the Bavarian &quot;Landtag&quot; is elected through mixed-member proportional representation. There are at least 180 seats, but more are sometimes added as overhang and leveling seats.

As of the 2018 and 2023 elections, the state is divided into 91 electoral districts, which each elect one representative in the same manner as under first-past-the-post. To achieve a proportional result, another 89 seats are elected on open party lists in the 7 administrative regions of the state, which the Constitution of Bavaria define as constituencies. Seats are assigned to each constituency based on population. The 89 seats are allocated to the parties such that, also taking into account the 91 districts seats, each party is represented in proportion to its share of the vote in the constituencies. On election day, people vote separately for a candidate in their electoral districts (called the &quot;first vote&quot;) and for a candidate in their constituency (called the &quot;second vote&quot;).

As of the 2018 and 2023 elections, seats are assigned to the constituency as follows:

<doc id="435434" wikidata="Q231384" url="?curid=435434" title="Zvi Mazel">
<text>Zvi Mazel (; born 4 March 1939) is an Israeli diplomat. He has served as the Israeli ambassador to Egypt, Romania, and Sweden.

==Education and work experience==
Mazel was born in Bnei Brak, and served in the IDF from 1956 to 1958. After initial studies in Israel, Mazel studied political science in France, at the Institut d&#x27;Études Politiques de Paris (The Parisian Institute for Political Studies). There he met his wife, Michelle, a political scientist and writer. He graduated in 1963, and joined the diplomatic corps of the Israeli Foreign Ministry in 1966, where he served as a researcher at the Foreign Ministry&#x27;s Institute of Political Research.

From 1969 to 1973, he served as First Secretary of the Israeli Embassy in Antananarivo, Madagascar, and then served as an attache at the Israeli Embassy in Paris until 1977, when he returned to Israel to again serve as a researcher in the Institute of Political Research.

From 1980 to 1982, he served at the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, during the thaw period between Israel and Egypt that ended with the 1982 Lebanon War. During this period, he also held the post as director of Eastern European division and head of the Egyptian and North African department at the Foreign Ministry.

In 1989 he was posted as ambassador to Romania, where he witnessed the Romanian Revolution.

In 1992 he was appointed Deputy Director of the Foreign Ministry in charge of African affairs and was instrumental in reestablishing diplomatic relations between Israel and 19 African countries. In 1996 he returned to Egypt as an ambassador, and remained five years in that country.

In 2002, he was appointed ambassador to Sweden, and served in this position until 2004. He retired from the foreign service in April 2004 at age 65.

Mazel has written extensively on Israeli-Turkish and Israeli-Egyptian relations, commenting that Erdogan&#x27;s attempts to reverse Atatürk&#x27;s secular policies have put him and Turkey at odds with Israel and the Western world. He sees pragmatic elements in the leaders of post-revolution Egypt, but dismisses the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s potential for moderation. He is a fellow of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs.

==Ambassadorship to Sweden==
While serving as ambassador to Sweden, Mazel became a controversial figure in the country. Once, in reaction to a call to highlight that products from Israeli settlements sometimes had been labeled to fit into the EU-Israel tax-free trade agreement, Mazel stated that the Swedish Archbishop K. G. Hammar &quot;probably is an anti-semite.&quot; He has also been quoted as saying that Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh&#x27;s criticism of Israel&#x27;s alleged human rights violations could not be tolerated. Mazel also called former foreign minister Sten Andersson and Sweden&#x27;s UN ambassador Pierre Schori &quot;professional anti-Israelis.&quot;

At the same time Mazel embraced personalities seen as controversial in Sweden as &quot;Israel-friendly&quot;. Most noted was in 2003, when Mazel appeared in a well known picture with Helge Fossmo, at that time only known as leader of an ultra-conservative religious group, later imprisoned as the person behind one of the most highly publicized murder cases in Sweden&#x27;s modern history, the Knutby murder.

In January 2004, Mazel vandalized the art installation &quot;Snow White and The Madness of Truth&quot; by Israeli-born Swedish artist Dror Feiler and his wife Gunilla Sköld Feiler. The installation took advantage of the reflecting pool in the courtyard of the Swedish History Museum, that was highlighted and filled with red liquid signifying blood. The work further consisted of plaques with poetry on the surrounding walls and music by J.S. Bach. Well-lit on the surface of a basin: a styrofoam boat, displaying a portrait of the Palestinian suicide bomber Hanadi Jaradat, who had perpetrated the Maxim restaurant suicide bombing a few months earlier, on one side and the word &quot;Snövit&quot; (&quot;Snow White&quot; in Swedish) written on the backside. Mazel pushed some lightstands into the pool, causing a short-circuit and disabling the light, and then told Feiler that: &quot;This is not a work of art. This is an expression of hatred for the Israeli people. This has glorified suicide bombers&quot;. Further he said to the press that the piece constituted a &quot;complete legitimization of genocide, the murder of innocent people, innocent civilians, under the guise of culture&quot;. Feiler rejected charges that their intention was to glorify suicide bombers and accused Mazel of &quot;practicing censorship&quot;. Feiler, who would play at the opening ceremony, refused to begin until Mazel left. Despite trying to explain himself, Mazel was asked to leave and escorted off the premises by museum security. The Swedish Foreign Ministry summoned him to ask for clarifications over the incident.

Mazel stated that &quot;Sweden is among the most severely anti-Semitic places&quot; with &quot;daily agitations in the media to kill Jews.&quot; Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon later thanked Mazel &quot;for his stand against the growing wave of anti-Semitism&quot; in Sweden.

In August 2009, the now-retired Mazel responded to the Swedish government&#x27;s refusal to reprimand the tabloid &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; for publishing allegations that Israel harvested organs from dead Palestinians. He said that there is no freedom of press in Sweden (Reporters Without Borders, in its 2009 press freedom index rankings showed that Sweden shared the top position with four other countries.) Mazel also said that the Social Democrats control the news with about 80% of Swedish newspapers connected to the Social Democrat movement, including the &quot;four national papers&quot;. The newspaper &quot;Sydsvenska Dagbladet&quot; commented that Mazel perhaps was alluding to the national papers &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;, &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;, &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; and &quot;Expressen&quot;, and noted that of these four, &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; was the only one with a possible Social Democrat connection, as the trade unions have a 9% share in the newspaper. According to Helle Klein, Mazel&#x27;s ideas about Sweden may be from people like Helge Fossmo and other Christian extremists.

<doc id="435437" wikidata="Q731498" url="?curid=435437" title="Snow White and the Madness of Truth">
<text>Snow White and the Madness of Truth () was a 2004 item of installation art by Swedish, Israeli-born composer and musician Dror Feiler and his Swedish wife, artist Gunilla Sköld-Feiler. Feiler and Sköld-Feiler created the visuals and the music for the artwork together, which was installed in the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm, Sweden.

The installation consisted of a long pool of water coloured blood red, upon which floated a small white boat named &quot;Snövit&quot; (&quot;Snow White&quot;) carrying a smiling portrait of Hanadi Jaradat, a Palestinian suicide bomber who killed 21 Jewish and Arab Israelis, and injured 51 more. 

A text was written on the walls, and the sound of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut&quot; (Cantata 199) played in the background. This piece begins with the words, &quot;My heart swims in blood / because the brood of my sins / in God&#x27;s holy eyes / makes me into a monster&quot;. According to the artists, the installation was made to &quot;call attention to how weak people left alone can be capable of horrible things&quot;.

The artwork became the centre of some controversy when then Israeli ambassador to Sweden, Zvi Mazel, vandalized it, claiming that it &quot;glorified suicide bombers&quot; and was &quot;an expression of hatred for the Israeli people.&quot; Reactions to the piece have been compared to reactions to Steve Earle&#x27;s song &quot;John Walker&#x27;s Blues&quot;, which appeared on his 2002 album &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.

== Controversy ==
In early 2004 the artwork briefly came to the attention of the international media after it was vandalized on January 16 by Zvi Mazel, the Israeli ambassador to Sweden. Mazel disconnected the electricity powering the installation and tipped one of its lights into the water, causing a short circuit. When Mazel was asked to leave he refused and had to be escorted out by museum security. The event was filmed by the museum&#x27;s security cameras.

Mazel later gave contradicting statements about the event. To the Swedish media, he said it was done in the heat of the moment, but to Israeli media he said it was premeditated and that he had planned it even before he saw the artwork.

The installation was a part of the Making Differences exhibition at the Swedish History Museum. On January 18, 2004, Thomas Nordanstad, who was responsible for the exhibition, was attacked by an unidentified man who tried to push Nordanstad down a staircase. Nordanstad had also recently received over 400 e-mails containing various threats. Both Kristian Berg, head of the museum, and the artists also received many threats. The following Sunday, a museum guard had to remove a group of people who were throwing various objects into the water. After the attack on Nordanstad the number of visitors to the museum increased to approximately 1,400 per day, up from roughly the same number per week.

According to Swedish Dagens Nyheter journalist Henrik Brors there may have been hidden motives behind Mazel&#x27;s act. He speculated that it may have been done in an effort to discredit Sweden and the European Union by depicting them as antisemites, and to have the EU back down from its peace efforts in the Middle East. In the analysis in Dagens Nyheter Brors further speculated that Mazel may have done it to give Israel an excuse for not attending the international anti-genocide conference Stockholm International Forum that was to be held in Stockholm January 26–28.

The Young Christian Democrats, the youth organisation of the Swedish Christian Democratic party, reported the artwork to the police in hope that action could be taken pursuant to Sweden&#x27;s strict laws against hate speech. Mazel himself asked in an interview &quot;If we Jews say that this offends us, why can&#x27;t a government remove it?&quot;.

Stockholms Lokaltrafik decided to remove advertising of the Making Differences exhibit that used a picture of Hanadi Jaradat; those posters were a part of C. M. V. Hausswolff&#x27;s artwork &quot;God made me do it&quot; and had nothing to do with Feiler/Sköld installation &quot;Snow White and the Madness of Truth.&quot;

An e-mail protest organized by the Simon Wiesenthal Center was directed at Prime Minister Göran Persson&#x27;s office. By the morning of January 27, 2004, 13,603 emails had been received.

Kristian Berg stated that &quot;I did not hear anyone who saw the work say that it was an anti-Semitic installation, against the Jewish people or against the Israeli people, I therefore think that this work was politically hijacked – the interpretation that Ambassador Mazel gave it was very narrow and very political.&quot;

As scheduled, the artwork was removed from display on February 8, 2004. In 2011 the Feilers created a new installation called &quot;Once upon a time in the middle of winter&quot; based on the events.

<text>Dror Elimelech Feiler (born 31 August 1951) is a Swedish musician, artist and left-wing activist. He is married to the artist Gunilla Sköld-Feiler.

==Early life and career==
Feiler was born in Tel Aviv in 1951 to Eliezer and Pnina Feiler, and moved with his family to kibbutz Yad Hana in 1967. His father, Eliezer Feiler, was a left-wing activist. In 1978, he and others secretly met with a group of Palestine Liberation Organization representatives in Bucharest while it was still illegal. Eliezer Feiler was tried and eventually sentenced to six months of community service and a IL4,000 fine. The fine was paid, but the sentence was never served because, while the legal process was ongoing, the law had changed and it was no longer illegal to meet with members of the PLO. His mother, Pnina Feiler, born 1923, was among the founders of Yad Hana. She worked with mobile health centrals in Palestinian villages in the West Bank that have to travel far to get access to healthcare and other services until 2015, when she stopped due to her advanced age. Dror Feiler served as a paratrooper in the Israel Defense Forces.

Feiler left Israel in the early 70s to pursue his musical studies in Sweden, where he met his wife. Swedish law at that time did not recognize dual citizenship, and Feilor had to relinquish his Israeli citizenship in order to become a citizen of Sweden. He studied avant-garde music and its interpretation at the Fylkingen Institut for New Music from 1975 to 1977, musicology at Stockholm University from 1977 to 1978 and composition at the Music Academy of Stockholm from 1978 to 1983.

In January 2004 he and Gunilla Sköld-Feiler made international news with their art installation &quot;Snow White and The Madness of Truth&quot;, which referred to Palestinian female suicide bomber Hanadi Jaradat, which was vandalised by the then Israeli ambassador to Sweden Zvi Mazel. The installation consisted of a long pool of water coloured blood red, upon which floated a small white boat named &quot;Snövit&quot; (&quot;Snow White&quot;) carrying a portrait of Hanadi Jaradat. She had blown herself up in October 2003 in an attack on Maxim&#x27;s restaurant in the northern Israeli city of Haifa, killing 21 Jewish and Arab Israelis and injuring 51.

He runs the artspace TEGEN 2 in Stockholm together with Gunilla Sköld Feiler.

He is active as a composer of modern music, including pieces for symphonic orchestras, opera, chamber music and electro-acoustic music. In April 2008, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra dropped the world premiere of his composition &quot;Halat Hisar&quot; (State of Siege), after musicians complained that the music, which includes machine gun sounds, was so loud that it gave them ear problems and headaches.

On 31 May 2010 Feiler was aboard one of the ships involved in the Gaza flotilla raid and sustained some minor injuries to the face during the raid. For his participation in the raid, Feiler was banned from entering Israel for 10 years. In July 2010, he flew to Israel together with Swedish MP Mehmet Kaplan, who had also received a 10-year entry ban over his participation, planning to lodge a complaint with the Israel Police over the flotilla raid. They were refused entry at Ben Gurion Airport and deported. In 2011, Feiler was involved in the Freedom Flotilla II, and was among 15 activists arrested by Israeli authorities aboard the boat &quot;Dignité&quot;. He was subsequently deported from Israel. 

In the 2010 Swedish general election, Feiler was a candidate for the Left Party () in Stockholm. He obtained 1,784 personal preference votes in Stockholm Municipality (4.51% of the Left Party votes, the second most voted candidate on the list after party chairman Lars Ohly) and 629 personal preference votes in Stockholm County (1.99% of the Left Party votes).

==Attempts to visit his mother==
In 2013, Feiler appealed his ban from Israel in order to visit his ailing 90-year-old mother. His mother, then 90, had to fly to Sweden to meet up with her son, though subsequently, due to health problems, that option ceased to be available. She therefore repeatedly requested the Israeli Ministry for the Interior to lift his ban, without success. In 2018, after Swedish law dropped its ban on dual citizenship, Feiler asked for his citizenship to be restored on the basis of his right to make aliyah and be with his aging mother. No reply was forthcoming. In response to a petition by the family&#x27;s attorney in December 2019, the director of the Population and Immigration Authority Prof. Shlomo Mor-Yosef in January 2020 conceded permission for a 2-week visit on condition he post a $28,910 bond. This condition was appealed and, in September, a judge extended his visa by a further 2 weeks, since, were he to visit, he would have to stay in quarantine for 14 days, given the COVID-19 crisis. That crisis had also affected Feiler&#x27;s concert schedule, depriving him of adequate financial means to post the bond.

<text>Harry Bannink (10 April 1929, Enschede – 19 October 1999, Bosch en Duin) was a Dutch composer, arranger and pianist. He wrote over 3,000 songs.

Bannink studied at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, receiving his degree in 1946. He started his musical career in the late fifties, when he joined a small dance-orchestra as pianist. His compositions for the play &quot;Het staat u vrij&quot; (Delftsch Studenten Corps, 1958) were his first works for the theatre. Later he would write music for many songs by Wim Sonneveld, Wieteke Van Dort and especially Annie M.G. Schmidt. . He wrote music for many Dutch TV-shows, including &quot;Ja zuster, nee zuster&quot;, &quot;″t Schaep met de 5 poten&quot;, &quot;Sesamstraat&quot;, and &quot;De Stratemakeropzeeshow&quot;. Since 1973 he worked with Edwin Rutten on the weekly children&#x27;s TV show &quot;De film van ome Willem&quot; (in which he appeared as head of the music-ensemble on every episode) and writer Willem Wilmink, with whom he wrote a lot of songs for the Dutch children&#x27;s education programme &quot;Het Klokhuis&quot;.

Together with Annie M.G. Schmidt he wrote several Dutch musicals. Later, he would also write the music for the funeral of Schmidt. Among his last musical activities were a CD - on which he sang some of his own compositions - and a book with piano-arrangements of all the songs from the series &quot;Ja zuster, nee zuster&quot;. He died, aged 70, of cardiac arrest and was buried at the Nieuwe Algemene Begraafplaats, Woudenbergseweg in Zeist.

In 2000, a documentary about Harry Bannink and his work was released on Dutch television. In his birthplace Enschede, a theatre was named after him, as was a street in Amsterdam and Utrecht.

<doc id="435453" wikidata="Q7574852" url="?curid=435453" title="Special counsel">
<text>In the United States, a special counsel (formerly called special prosecutor or independent counsel) is a lawyer appointed to investigate, and potentially prosecute, a particular case of suspected wrongdoing for which a conflict of interest exists for the usual prosecuting authority. Other jurisdictions have similar systems. Special prosecutors also have handled investigations into those connected to the government but not in a position of direct authority over the Justice Department&#x27;s prosecutors, such as cabinet secretaries or election campaigns.

While the most prominent special prosecutors have been those appointed since the 1870s to investigate presidents and those connected to them, the term can also be used to refer to any prosecutor appointed to avoid a conflict of interest or appearance thereof. The concept originates in state law: &quot;state courts have traditionally appointed special prosecutors when the regular government attorney was disqualified from a case, whether for incapacitation or interest.&quot;

Because district attorneys&#x27; offices work closely with police, some activists argue that cases of police misconduct at the state and local level should be handled by special prosecutors.

==Terminology==
The terms &#x27;special prosecutor&#x27;, &#x27;independent counsel&#x27;, and &#x27;special counsel&#x27; have the same fundamental meaning, and their use (at least at the federal level in the U.S.) is generally differentiated by the time period to which they are being applied. The term &#x27;special prosecutor&#x27; was used throughout the Watergate era, but was replaced by the less confrontational &#x27;independent counsel&#x27; in the 1983 reauthorization of the Ethics in Government Act. Those appointed under that act after 1983 are generally referred to as &#x27;independent counsels&#x27;. Since the independent counsel law expired in 1999, the term &#x27;special counsel&#x27; has been used. This is the term used in the current U.S. government regulations concerning the appointment of special counsels, such as Title 28 CFR.

While the term &#x27;special prosecutor&#x27; is sometimes used in historical discussions of such figures before 1983, the term &#x27;special counsel&#x27; appears to have been frequently used as well, including, for example, in contemporary newspaper accounts describing the first presidentially-appointed special counsel in 1875.

==United States appointment at the federal level==

=== Pre-Watergate ===
In 1875, Ulysses Grant appointed the first federal special prosecutor, John B. Henderson, to investigate the Whiskey Ring scandal. After attempting to stifle Henderson&#x27;s investigation of the president&#x27;s personal secretary, Grant fired Henderson on the grounds that Henderson&#x27;s statements to a grand jury regarding Grant were impertinent. Following criticism, Grant appointed a new special prosecutor, James Broadhead, to continue the investigation.

In 1881, James Garfield appointed the next special prosecutor, William Cook, to investigate the Star route scandal. Cook continued his investigation into the Chester Arthur administration.

From 1901 to 1909, during the Theodore Roosevelt administration, special prosecutors were appointed to investigate two scandals. In 1903, Roosevelt appointed two special prosecutors (a Democrat and a Republican) to investigate allegations of bribery at the Post Office Department. In 1905, Roosevelt&#x27;s attorney general, Philander Knox, appointed Francis Heney as a special prosecutor to investigate the Oregon land fraud scandal.

In 1924, Calvin Coolidge appointed two special counsels from the two major parties of the time, Atlee Pomerene (a Democrat) and Owen Roberts (a Republican), to investigate the Teapot Dome scandal. This appointment was unique in that it was mandated under a special Congressional joint resolution, and was subject to approval in the Senate, similar to a cabinet appointment. This process was unique in the history of federal special prosecutors.

In 1952, Harry Truman appointed Newbold Morris as a &quot;special assistant to the Attorney General&quot; to investigate the corruption at the Bureau of Internal Revenue following Congressional pressure and calls for a special prosecutor. After Morris submitted a lengthy questionnaire on personal finances to be completed by all senior executive officers, he was fired by Attorney General Howard McGrath, who was in turn fired by the president. Following the appointment of a new attorney general, the investigation was continued through regular channels.

=== Watergate ===
Before his May 25, 1973 appointment as Richard Nixon&#x27;s attorney general, Elliott Richardson had agreed at his Senate confirmation hearing to appoint a Watergate special prosecutor, and so immediately on taking office appointed Archibald Cox under a special one-time regulation. As part of his investigation, in July of that year, Cox first requested and then subpoenaed the Nixon White House tapes; secret recordings Nixon had made of conversations in the Oval Office and elsewhere. The Nixon administration refused to produce the tapes citing executive privilege, and the dispute was fought in court until October.

After a Court of Appeals instructed the president to comply with the special prosecutor&#x27;s subpoena, Nixon ordered the special prosecutor fired. In a constitutional crisis that became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, both the attorney general and deputy attorney general (who had both made promises regarding the special prosecutor in their Senate confirmation hearings) resigned rather than carry out the order to fire Cox. Solicitor General Robert Bork, who was third in line at the Department of Justice, then fired Cox. Initially, the Nixon White House announced that the office of the special prosecutor had been abolished, but after public outcry Nixon instead had Bork appoint Leon Jaworski as the second Watergate special prosecutor. The firing was ruled illegal in the case of &quot;Nader v. Bork&quot;, but, as a new special prosecutor had already been appointed, the case was already moot when decided, and the decision was never appealed past the district court.

Jaworski continued Cox&#x27;s pursuit of the White House tapes, but Nixon resisted. He raised separation of powers questions under the U.S. Constitution. Since the special counsel is a member of the executive branch, Nixon argued that the special counsel is ultimately answerable to the president and that the president could not be compelled by a subpoena issued by his own subordinate. The tapes were ultimately released following the Supreme Court decision in &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot;. Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, and Jaworski resigned about two and a half months later, to be replaced by his (and Cox&#x27;s) deputy, Henry Ruth Jr.—who in turn resigned in 1975, leaving Charles Ruff the fourth and final Watergate special prosecutor.

Acting under his existing appointment as Watergate special prosecutor, Ruff conducted an unrelated investigation into whether Gerald Ford had misused campaign funds while a congressman, clearing the new president of any wrongdoing.

=== Ethics in Government Act ===
Inspired in part by Watergate, in 1978 Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act. Title VI of this act was known as the Special Prosecutor Act and later renamed the Independent Counsel Act, which established formal rules for the appointment of a special prosecutor. The appointment of special prosecutors varied in important ways from appointments made before and since. Majorities of either party within the House or Senate Judiciary Committee could formally request the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor on a particular matter, but the decision of whether or not to appoint the independent counsel remained with the attorney general and was not reviewable in court. If the attorney general decided not to appoint an independent counsel in response to such a request, they were only required to respond in writing with the reasons. Although the decision to appoint a special prosecutor was still made by the attorney general, the actual selection of the special prosecutor was made by a three-judge panel called the Special Division, selected from the Courts of Appeals. The law did not allow special prosecutors to be removed except under specific circumstances such as wrongdoing or incapacitation. The special prosecutor provisions in the bill were temporary but were reauthorized by Congress in 1983 and 1987, expiring five years later in 1992; they were reinstated for another five years in 1994 before expiring again in 1999. The constitutionality of the law was affirmed by a 7–1 decision of the Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot;.

Roughly twenty special prosecutors (called independent counsels after 1983) were appointed under the Ethics in Government Act and its reauthorizations during the Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton administrations. These include significant investigations into the Iran–Contra affair and the Whitewater controversy, the latter of which ultimately led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton over the Lewinsky scandal. Numerous smaller investigations into cabinet secretaries for relatively minor offenses, such as drug use, were also carried out by independent counsels during this period.

During the period 1992–1994 when the independent counsel provisions were not in force, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert Fiske special counsel to investigate the Whitewater controversy. When the law was reauthorized in 1994, Reno invoked it to order an independent counsel be appointed to investigate Whitewater, and suggested Fiske continue in that role. Instead, Ken Starr was given the job by the three-judge panel. Starr resigned and was replaced by Robert Ray in 1999 just before the expiration of the independent counsel statute. Ray formally concluded the Whitewater investigation in 2003.

===Current regulations===

Since the expiration of the independent counsel statute in 1999, there has been no federal statutory law governing the appointment of a special counsel. Upon the law&#x27;s expiration in 1999, the Justice Department, under Attorney General Janet Reno, promulgated procedural regulations governing the appointment of special counsels.

In 1999, these regulations were used by Reno to appoint John Danforth special counsel to investigate the FBI&#x27;s handling of the Waco siege.

In 2003, during the George W. Bush administration, Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed special counsel to investigate the Plame affair by Deputy Attorney General James Comey after the recusal of Attorney General John Ashcroft.

On May 17, 2017, former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to take over the previous FBI investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

In December 2020, Attorney General William Barr revealed to Congress that John Durham&#x27;s investigation had been granted special counsel status on October 19.

On November 18, 2022, Attorney General Garland named Jack Smith special counsel to investigate Donald Trump&#x27;s actions regarding the January 6 United States Capitol attack and handling of classified documents.

On January 12, 2023, Garland appointed Robert Hur special counsel to investigate Joe Biden&#x27;s storage of classified materials.

On August 11, 2023 Merrick Garland appointed David C. Weiss special counsel to investigate Joe Biden&#x27;s son Hunter Biden stemming from nearly five years of federal investigations into felony tax evasion, illegal foreign lobbying, money laundering, and other possible crimes. This development came shortly after Republicans alleged that Hunter received a &quot;sweetheart&quot; deal in Delaware where he was facing several criminal charges relates to tax evasion and firearm offenses.

====Constitutionality====
On 15 July 2024, federal judge Aileen Cannon, in a 93-page ruling, ruled that Jack Smith&#x27;s appointment and funding were both unconstitutional under Article I, Section 9, Clause 7, of the US Constitution, which prohibits appropriations except when authorized by law. She also ruled that it was disallowed by Article II Section 2 Clause 2, which requires principal officers to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Therefore, she dismissed the classified documents case that a grand jury under Smith had brought against former president Donald Trump. Smith&#x27;s office announced that it would appeal the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

Cannon&#x27;s ruling adopted the arguments on this issue made by Supreme Court associate justice Clarence Thomas in his concurrence in the Trump v. United States case decided two weeks earlier.

The 1988 Supreme Court case Morrison v. Olson had upheld appointment of special counsels, calling them &quot;inferior officers&quot; and not &quot;officers&quot;. Cannon discussed that case, however, arguing that it no longer had any applicability, on the grounds that it concerned special counsels appointed under the special statutory authority of the Independent Counsels Act, which law Congress had since allowed to expire, and hence Smith&#x27;s appointment was not made under it.

==Legal authority==
In 1999, the Department of Justice under Attorney General Janet Reno promulgated regulations for the future appointment of special counsels. , these regulations remain in effect in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 28, part 600 (28 CFR §600). The regulations restrict the power to fire the special counsel into the hands of the attorney general alone, and they forbid the firing of the special counsel without good cause. They are internal Department of Justice regulations deriving their power from various acts of Congress, codified at U.S. Code, Title 28, section 510 and 515 (28 U.S.C. 510 and 515). Congress has the power to directly limit the firing of special prosecutors or to delegate that power to the Attorney General. An agency regulation promulgated within the authority granted by statute has the force and effect of law, is binding upon the body that issues it, and can not be arbitrarily revoked.

The existence of a law or regulations specifying the process to appoint a special counsel has not stopped the attorney general (or acting attorney general) from using their statutory authority to appoint a special counsel by other means, as has happened twice. Despite the passage of the Ethics in Government Act the previous year, Paul Curran was appointed to investigate Jimmy Carter&#x27;s peanut business in 1979 under the attorney general&#x27;s statutory authority (and was selected by him rather than by a three-judge panel as under the law), ostensibly because the alleged wrongdoing preceded the passage of the act. Patrick Fitzgerald&#x27;s appointment as special counsel in 2003 was specifically not made under the 28 CFR 600 regulation. The special counsel regulations specify that a special counsel must be a lawyer from outside the US government, while Fitzgerald was already a federal prosecutor at the time of his appointment.

===Initiating a special counsel investigation===
The decision to appoint a special counsel rests with the attorney general (or acting attorney general). The current special counsel regulations specify that:

The attorney general sets the subject jurisdiction of the special counsel:

The choice of whom to appoint is to be made by the attorney general with the following guidelines:

===Terminating a special counsel investigation===
Generally, the special counsel him or herself decides when an investigation will terminate, with or without formal charges being pursued. The special counsel typically issues a final report on their investigation at this time. The current special counsel regulations specify that &quot;At the conclusion of the Special Counsel&#x27;s work, he or she shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.&quot;

====Firing the special counsel====
The current special counsel regulations specify that:

===Role of the legislative and judicial branches===
Since the expiration of the independent counsel provisions in the Ethics in Government Act in 1999, as was the case before 1978, neither Congress nor the courts have any official role in the appointment of a special counsel; however, Congress can use other powers to pressure an administration into appointing a special counsel. This happened, for example, in the appointment of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox; senators secured a promise from Attorney General nominee Richardson to appoint a Watergate special prosecutor as a condition of his confirmation. Congress also has independent authority to investigate the president and their close associates through Congressional hearings as part of its government oversight role.

==At the state level==
Special prosecutors are appointed in state court with greater frequency than federal, and most often in cases where a conflict of interest arises or to avoid even the appearance such a conflict exists. In local state governments, special prosecutors are appointed by a judge, government official, organization, company or group of citizens to prosecute violations of law committed by one or more governmental agents and procure indictments for actions taken under color of state law. Unlike in courts having federal jurisdiction, where the terms &quot;special counsel&quot; and &quot;independent counsel&quot; have a uniform definition, in state court meanings of legal terms continually vary, but with &quot;special prosecutor&quot; referencing the appointment of an attorney (supra) in contemplation of representation and prosecution of one or more government agent(s) for unlawful conduct.

<doc id="435454" wikidata="Q5337013" url="?curid=435454" title="Edensor Park, New South Wales">
<text>Edensor Park is a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Edensor Park is located 38 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Fairfield. It is mainly a residential area, Edensor Park is part of the Greater Western Sydney region.

==History==
John Brown Bossley (1810–1872) came to Australia around 1838 and practised as a chemist in Sydney. Bossley built an English styled farmhouse on his land near Clear Paddock Creek. He called the property Edensor, after a village near Chatsworth in Derbyshire, England. This established the name Edensor Park after Edensor House. Edensor Park and its surrounding suburbs was a rural area until the 1970s, when it was developed into a residential settlement. Edensor Park belonged to the Prospect County Council, before its amalgamation into Fairfield City Council.

==Commercial area==
Edensor Park is a mainly residential suburb served by a local shopping centre, Edensor Park Plaza, which features a Coles supermarket and a number of convenient stores and delis.

==Schools==
Edensor Park is served by two primary schools Edensor Park Public School and Governor Philip King Public School and three high schools outside the suburb.

==Sport and recreation==
Edensor Park has a number of recreation areas including Angle Vale Reserve, Allambie Reserve and Bosnjak Park. It is also home to the Sydney United Sports Centre, home of the Croatian backed football (soccer) team, Sydney United, which was once a member of the now defunct Australian National Soccer League (NSL) and currently plays in the New South Wales Premier League.

Another local sporting team is the CVD Edensor Park Cobras Junior Rugby league Football Club, who play in the Parramatta Junior Rugby League Association and use Bosnjak Park as their home ground. Edensor Park is also home to the Nineveh Club, the first Assyrian social club to be built in Australia. The club was constructed in the early 70s using ancient Assyrian features and is distinguished by two winged bulls at the entrance. Girl guides named after the above-mentioned area

==Population==
Edensor Park residents are culturally diverse, with ethnic backgrounds from the Middle East, Europe and Asia.

According to the 2021 Census 43.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Iraq 17.9%, Vietnam 7.8%, Cambodia 2.5%, Syria 2.4% and Italy 2.3%.

<text>A fireman&#x27;s chair knot (also known as the chair knot) is a knot tied in the bight forming two adjustable, lockable loops. The knot consists of a handcuff knot finished with a locking half hitch around each loop. The loops remain adjustable until the half hitches are tightened.

==Usage==

The knot was first introduced by the Victorian chief fire officer Eyre Massey-Shaw in 1876.

Made with suitable rope by qualified personnel this knot can be used as a rescue harness capable of supporting a person while being hoisted or lowered to safety. One loop supports the body, around the chest and under the arms, and the other loop supports the legs, under the knees. Tied towards the middle of a line, one end is used for lowering and the other end can serve as a tagline, to control the victim&#x27;s position with respect to hazards during the descent. A snug fitting of this knot should restrain the victim, even if unconscious. The fireman&#x27;s chair can also be used to move a victim laterally when used as a part of a tensioned horizontal highline system.

The fireman&#x27;s chair knot is generally considered to be merely a makeshift harness, to be used when conventional rope rescue techniques are not available; it is rarely used by modern rescue teams.

<text>The Fitzroy River (Darumbal: ) is a river in Central Queensland, Australia. Its catchment covers an area of , making it the largest river catchment flowing to the eastern coast of Australia. It is also the largest river basin that discharges onto the Great Barrier Reef.

==Course and features==
Formed by the confluence of the Mackenzie and Dawson rivers that drain the Expedition Range and the Carnarvon Range respectively, the Fitzroy River rises near Duaringa and flows initially north by east, then northward near the Goodedulla National Park. The river then flows in an easterly direction near the Lake Learmouth State Forest and parallel with the Bruce Highway through the settlement of , before turning south to where the river is crossed by the Bruce Highway. After flowing through Rockhampton, the river flows south by east past the Berserker Range past Humbug Point to the south of the Flat Top Range and eventually discharging into Keppel Bay in the Coral Sea near the MacKenzie Island Conservation Park.

From source to mouth, the Fitzroy River is joined by thirty-six tributaries including the Mackenzie River with its tributaries the Nogoa River, Comet River, Isaac River and its tributary Connors River; and the Dawson River which has two tributaries, the Don River and Dee River.

===Catchment===
The catchment area of the river occupies an area of Within the drainage basin an area of is composed of estuarine wetlands and an area of is made up of riverine wetlands. The catchment stretches from the Carnarvon Range in the west to the rivermouth in Keppel Bay, near Rockhampton. It is bounded to the north by the Burdekin River catchment area and to the south by the Burnett River catchment area.

The river has a mean annual discharge of . There are also several important aquifers providing groundwater extractions in the Fitzroy Basin.

The Fitzroy River basin is one of a number that experienced extensive flooding during the 2010–11 Queensland floods. In 2013, flash flooding in the Mount Morgan and Biloela regions brought major flooding to the lower Dawson River catchment. The Don River and the Dee River also rose to new record heights. The Fitzroy River at Rockhampton rose above major flooding to .

===Reservoirs===
The Fitzroy River catchment system has many weirs and dams, used for farming, mining and domestic consumption. In the Dawson River sub-catchment, the major reservoirs from source to mouth are the Glebe Weir, the Gyranda Weir, the Theodore Weir, the Moura Weir, the Callide Dam, and the Kroombit Dam. In the Mackenzie River sub-catchment, the major reservoirs are the Comet Weir, the Fairbairn Dam, the Theresa Creek Dam, the Bedford Weir, the Bingegang Weir, and the Tartrus Weir. In the main Fitzroy River sub-catchment the only reservoirs are the Eden Bann Weir and the Fitzroy River Barrage, with the latter capable of holding when full, to provide potable water to Rockhampton city and surrounds.

The Fairbairn Dam on the Nogoa River and several weirs downstream on the Mackenzie River provide water for irrigating a wide range of crops including cotton, peanuts, chickpea, corn and horticulture including citrus, table grapes, melons, supplying water for coal mines and domestic use for the town of .

Rookwood Weir was completed in 2023. It is the largest weir built in the country since World War II.

==History==
The traditional owners of the area in the Fitzroy River catchment are the Darumbal people, notably the Baiali and Jetimarala clans. They called it Toonooba.

&quot;Yetimarala&quot; (also known as &quot;Jetimarala&quot;, &quot;Yetimaralla&quot;, and &quot;Bayali&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language of Central Queensland. Its traditional language region is within the local government areas of Central Highlands Region, on the Boomer Range and Broadsound Range and the Fitzroy River, Killarney Station, Mackenzie River and Isaac River.

The river was given its English name by European colonial settlers and pastoralists, Charles and William Archer, on 4 May 1853 in honour of Sir Charles FitzRoy, at the time the Governor of the Colony of New South Wales, as Queensland did not become a separate colony until 1859. The famous boatbuilder Colin Archer was the first known individual to sail up the river, with his cutter &quot;Ellida&quot;.

The city of Rockhampton is situated on the river, some from the coast. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the city was a major port, however rocky bars in the river prevented the Fitzroy from being used for navigation any further inland. As ships became larger, the lower reaches became less viable for commercial traffic, and today only pleasure craft and small commercial fishing boats use the river. Wharves which once lined the town reach at Rockhampton have now almost all disintegrated or been removed. Port Alma, in the Fitzroy River delta is now the nearest port to Rockhampton. Predominant industries in the catchment are coal mining, grazing and cotton.

Glenmore Homestead was built at a property on the northern bank of the river northwest of Rockhampton. It was originally settled in 1858, is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register and operates as a tourist attraction today.

The Fitzroy River in Rockhampton is often utilised for recreation. The Rockhampton Ski Gardens on the Fitzroy River just upstream from the Fitzroy River Barrage is used by sporting groups such as the local water skiing, dragon boat and rowing clubs. In 2018, a $36 million revitalisation of the Fitzroy riverbank in Rockhampton City was officially opened. Rockhampton&#x27;s annual Rocky River Run is also held along the Fitzroy River. The annual fishing competition, the Barra Bounty is another event held on the Fitzroy River in Rockhampton. The city celebrates the Fitzroy River each year at the river&#x27;s own annual festival, the Rockhampton River Festival.

In 2018, the Fitzroy River in Rockhampton was incorporated into the Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay prior to the 2018 Commonwealth Games. After running his leg of the relay, batonbearer Mark Knowles handed the Queen&#x27;s Baton to fellow batonbearer Craig McCormack who was then rowed across the river on a dragon boat as part of the relay.

==Wildlife==
The lower reaches of the river are home to salt water crocodiles. In 2003 a crocodile measuring more than long was captured. The most diverse range of freshwater fish in the country are found within the Fitzroy basin. The prized Australian fish, the barramundi, breeds in the river along with sooty grunter and a separate genetic strain of golden perch.

Some of the river&#x27;s floodplain and delta have been classified by BirdLife International as the Fitzroy Floodplain and Delta Important Bird Area (IBA). It regularly supports over 1% of the world population of the sharp-tailed sandpiper as well as having a resident breeding population of the range-restricted mangrove honeyeater.

At the mouth of the river researchers have discovered a genetically distinct snubfin dolphins species with a population of just 70 animals. The World Wildlife Fund had concerns that a planned coal port on Balaclava Island by Xstrata could wipe out the local snubfin population. In 2013 Glencore Xstrata halted its plans for the coal port due to high costs and massively reduced worldwide demand for coal. The firm cited a poor medium-term outlook for the coal industry.

<text>Angam Day is a holiday recognised in the Republic of Nauru. It is celebrated yearly on 26 October.
==Etymology==
The Nauruan word &quot;angam&quot; means &quot;jubilation&quot;, &quot;celebration&quot;, &quot;to have triumphed over all hardships&quot; or &quot;to have reached a set goal&quot; or &quot;coming home&quot;.

==General==
Angam Day is a day of celebration and a time of reflection for the Nauruan people. Twice in its history, the Nauruan population fell below 1,500, and the Nauruan ethnic group have been considered in danger of extinction. On both occasions the Nauruan population recovered. Upon eclipsing a population of 1,500, a number considered to be the minimum required for the survival of a race
(decided by the administrators of Nauru its chiefs after much deliberation), Angam Day was declared. The first Angam was in 1932 and the second occasion in 1949.

==History==

===Before Angam===
As early as 1902, an influenza epidemic took toll of no less than 219 lives. At the time of the initial phosphate operations during 1905 the population was about 1,550. With the introduction of labour for the phosphate operations, a sudden downward trend in brought by the newly introduced labour. This spate of epidemics included many casualties among the Nauruan people. During 1907, infantile paralysis systematically killed the Nauruan population.

The first goal came about in 1919, just after World War I, when the war-time occupation of Nauru and other Pacific islands was continued by forces of the British Empire, who had, in contravention of international treaty obligations, wrested these colonies from Imperial Germany. Nauru came under a League of Nations mandate, administered by Australia, New Zealand and Britain. Brigadier-General Thomas Griffiths, the Australian Administrator, held a census. Later, in a meeting with local chiefs, he declared that the population of Nauruans was alarmingly low and that if the Nauruans were to survive as a race, the population should be no less than 1,500. It was declared that when the population of 1,500 was reached, that day would be called &quot;Angam Day,&quot; would be a public holiday, and would be commemorated every year thereafter, as a prize to the mother. Furthermore, the baby who completed the set target would be the Angam Baby and would receive gifts and honour.

===First Angam===

After thirteen years, the Nauruan population reached 1,500 to much jubilation and celebrations. The first Angam Baby, Eidagaruwo, was born on 26 October 1932. Her name expresses the feeling of “reaching home” or “attaining a goal”; it was given to her by the Administrator and Chiefs. That night large bonfires were lit on the beach on every district and chiefs judged who had the biggest bonfire. Aiwo District had the largest bonfire with blue flames, made by stoking the fire with copper wire.

It turned out there was to be more than one Angam. During the Japanese occupation of Nauru and other Pacific territories during World War II, 1,201 Nauruans were evacuated to Truk (now Chuuk). Of the 1,201 evacuees to Truk only 737 returned after the war, and of the about 600 left behind on Nauru, a total of around 400 survived.

The Angam girl, Eidegenegen Eidagaruwo, did not make it back from Truk as she had died of malnutrition and yaws like most of the other Nauruans who had died in Truk.

===Second Angam===
The aftermath of WWII showed the Nauruans that, to survive as a race, they would have to strive to increase their population for a second time. The race for a new Angam Baby was on.

On 31 March 1949 the people of Boe celebrated when Bethel Enproe Adam was born to parents Kenye and Clarence Adam. Since then, the Nauruans have been able to celebrate Angam once again. Even though Bethel Enproe was born on a different date, October 26 is still held as the official Angam Day.

==Modern Angam Day Celebrations==
In 2017, at 91 years old, Muriel Cecil was the oldest Nauruan. She spoke on behalf of fellow survivors of the war underscoring in simple terms the hardship of war yet the blessings of God in bringing them back home from Truk Island.
Muriel donned a replica of the dress she and other female returnees from Truk wore on their return to Nauru in 1946 after two years in exile.

<text>William Crooks (6 April 1852 – 5 June 1921) was a noted trade unionist and politician from Poplar, London, and a member of the Fabian Society. He is particularly remembered for his campaigning work against poverty and inequality.

==Early life==
Born in Shirbutt Street, Poplar, Crooks was the third son of a ship&#x27;s stoker, George Crooks, who lost his arm in an accident when Crooks was three years old. His mother, Caroline Elizabeth (née Coates), then supported the family by working as a seamstress, but money was scarce and five of the children were temporarily forced to enter Poplar workhouse in 1861. This experience had a profound influence on Crooks&#x27;s views on poverty.

Educated at a local poor law school, Crooks worked initially as a grocer&#x27;s errand boy, then a blacksmith&#x27;s labourer and then as an apprentice cooper. A keen reader, Crooks learned about reformers such as Richard Cobden and John Bright, and was asked by his fellow workers to speak out about their working conditions. Consequently, he was sacked for being a political agitator. He remained a member of the Coopers Union from 1867 until his death in 1921.

== Working men union ==
After a short spell working in Liverpool, Crooks returned to London and found work in the docks. He developed his speaking skills outside the East India Dock gates. He also began to give political lectures, and his speaking abilities proved helpful in raising funds for 10,000 striking dockers in the 1889 London Dock Strike. Earlier that year, Crooks, a candidate for the Progressive Party, became one of the first labour members on the London County Council, and subsequently became the first working-class member, and later chairman, of the Poplar Board of Guardians. With support and help from friend and fellow member George Lansbury, Crooks set about reforming the local workhouse, creating a model for other poor law authorities.

A prominent local politician, he helped bring about many local improvements. In 1891 he &quot;warmly endorsed&quot; representation by the London Trades Council to restrict immigration. On 3 August 1895, Crooks formally opened Island Gardens, a park at the south end of the Isle of Dogs, opposite Greenwich Hospital. He also campaigned for the first Blackwall Tunnel, and as Chairman of the LCC Bridges Committee in 1898, he helped provide the Greenwich and Woolwich foot tunnels (completed in 1902 and 1912 respectively).

== Labour politician ==

In 1900 Crooks became the first Labour mayor of Poplar, and two years later was elected to Parliament as MP for Woolwich wresting the seat away from the Conservative Party in a massive electoral victory exceeding expectations. This success was the result of a pact between the Labour Representation Committee and the Liberal Party; his selection as prospective parliamentary candidate had been criticised by the Independent Labour Party. At the time, he was only the fourth Labour MP (preceded by James Keir Hardie, Richard Bell and David Shackleton; Arthur Henderson followed later in 1903).

As an MP, he retained his working-class roots and contacts, campaigned hard for workers&#x27; pensions, supported reforms to limit the powers of the House of Lords, and supported Balfour&#x27;s Unemployment Bill in 1905, as well as supporting his wife in seeking the right for women to obtain the vote. Re-elected in 1906, he supported the reforming Liberal governments of Campbell-Bannerman (1906–1908) and Asquith (1908–1910). Crooks lost his seat in Parliament at the January 1910 general election, but was re-elected at the December 1910 general election

In 1911 he fell out with the Trades Union Congress over support for the Labour Disputes Bill. In 1912 he supported the Feeble-Minded Persons (Control) Bill; Crooks has been quoted by the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as describing disabled people as &quot;like human vermin&quot; who &quot;crawl about doing absolutely nothing, except polluting and corrupting everything they touch&quot;. The full quote is:

&quot;I have taken part, in discussions in this House on the unemployable; I have taken Members in authority on both sides and shown them 300 or 400 men not one of whom would be privately employed by any person for anything at all, not even for their keep. These were formerly mentally defective children who had been allowed to drift about the world, and to become absolutely useless. There is only one fitting description; they are almost like human vermin. They crawl about, doing absolutely nothing, except polluting and corrupting everything they touch. We talk about the liberty of the subject. What nonsense! What waste of words! We ask that you should take these people and have proper control over them, because they have no control over themselves. They are verminous, dirty, with no idea of washing or cleansing themselves. Yet they are human beings, and you could, under proper control, so far improve them that they could be put to some employment, not enough to keep them—I never expect that—but sufficient to maintain themselves partly, and to give them a human existence which they have not got now. Above everything else, you would stop the supply of these children—a very important thing.&quot;

As a member of the Metropolitan Asylums Board he helped to raise the age the Board was required to look after those with a Developmental Disability from 16 to 21, and increased the teaching and training of those in its care.

On 18 September 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, Crooks led the House of Commons in singing the national anthem, and unlike pacifist colleagues in the Labour Party he supported the war efforts of the government. In 1916 he was one of the Labour MPs to form part of the executive of Viscount Milner&#x27;s &#x27;patriotic Labour&#x27; British Workers League (BWL). Under pressure from the Labour Party he resigned from the BWL at the end of 1917. In 1918 he was returned unopposed for the new Woolwich East constituency.

He remained an MP until ill-health forced his retirement in February 1921. He died in the London Hospital, Whitechapel four months later, and was buried in Tower Hamlets Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
In 1930, one of the Woolwich Ferry paddle-steamers was named in his memory (taken out of service in 1963). A council housing estate in his native Poplar still bears his name, as does a road in Eltham, just south of Woolwich.

<doc id="435476" wikidata="Q3418626" url="?curid=435476" title="Lionel Snell">
<text>Lionel Snell is an English writer, magician, and publisher. He has released numerous works on the subjects of magic and philosophy under various pen names, and is most famously known as Ramsey Dukes. He has been described as &quot;an important early contributor to the discussions of occultism in the mid- to late 1970s&quot;.

==Career==
In his youth, Snell received a series of scholarships which eventually allowed him to attend Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a degree in Pure Mathematics. 

His writings on the English artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare in &quot;Agape Occult Review&quot; (1972), and his philosophical theories published in &quot;SSOTBME: An Essay on Magic&quot; (1974) brought him into contact with the nascent chaos magic movement of the 1970s. Snell was active within this environment for most of the 1970s to the 1980s. 

The novel approach to magic which he developed during this period has been described as synthesizing &quot;the works of Crowley, Spare and Carlos Casteneda into a form of magical libertarianism.&quot; Due to his contribution in this area, Snell is often regarded as an important figure in the historical emergence of the chaos magic current.

As well as being a theorist of magic, Snell has also been an avid practitioner. In 1977, he claimed to have performed a well-known, but notably laborious and rarely attempted ritual called the Abramelin operation. Later, he engaged with occultist organisations such as Ordo Templi Orientis and Illuminates of Thanateros.

Since 2015, Snell has been running a YouTube channel, which has over a quarter million views as of July 2022.

== Philosophical works ==
===Words made Flesh===
Snell’s book &quot;Words Made Flesh&quot; (1987) takes a philosophical approach to the nature of reality. In this work, Snell outlines his “information model” theory of magic, which entertains the possibility that the universe could be a virtual reality. According to Steve Collins, this theme was later explored in popular culture through films such as &quot;The Matrix&quot;.

<text>Loriinae is a subfamily of psittacine birds, one of the six subfamilies that make up the family Psittaculidae. It consists of three tribes, the lories and lorikeets (Loriini), the budgerigar (Melopsittacini) and the fig parrots (Cyclopsittini), which are small birds, mostly of bright colors and inhabitants of Oceania and the islands of Southeast Asia.

==Taxonomy==
The subfamily Loriinae was introduced in 1836 (as Loriana and Lorianae) by the English naturalist Prideaux John Selby in his book &quot;The Natural History of Parrots&quot;. Traditionally it was considered that the lories were the only members of the subfamily Loriinae, or were integrated into their own family, Loriidae, but currently they are classified as a tribe, Loriini, within a larger subfamily Loriinae. The genetic studies showed that the lories are closely related to the budgerigar and the fig parrots of the genera &quot;Cyclopsitta&quot; and &quot;Psittaculirostris&quot;, that form the other two tribes that make up the subfamily, Melopsittacini and Cyclopsittini, respectively.
Loriinae is integrated as one of the five subfamilies of the family Psittaculidae, together with Psittaculinae, Platycercinae, Psittacellinae, Agapornithinae; and in turn Psittaculidae forms together with two families more the superfamily Psittacoidea.
