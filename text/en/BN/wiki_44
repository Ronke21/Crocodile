<text>Zdeno Chára (; born 18 March 1977) is a Slovak former professional ice hockey defenceman. He played 24 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Islanders, Ottawa Senators, Boston Bruins, and Washington Capitals between 1997 and 2022. Standing tall, Chára is the tallest person ever to play in the NHL, earning him the nickname &quot;Big Z&quot;. Internationally, he played for the Slovakia men&#x27;s national team and won two silver medals at the Ice Hockey World Championships. At the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, he won a silver medal playing for Team Europe. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2025.

Chára served as the Bruins&#x27; captain for all of his fourteen seasons with the franchise, from 2006 to 2020. He won the Norris Trophy as the league&#x27;s best defenceman in 2009, becoming the first Slovak player to do so, and the second European player after Nicklas Lidström. In 2011, 2013 and 2019 Chára captained the Bruins to the Stanley Cup Finals, winning in 2011. He is one of five European-born and raised captains to lead his team to the Stanley Cup championship, and the first to be born and trained in the Eastern Bloc. In 2022, Chára played in his 1,652nd NHL game, making him the league&#x27;s all-time leader in games played by a defenceman. He was the second to last NHL player to play in the 1990s.

==Playing career==

===New York Islanders (1997–2001)===
After being passed over in the 1995 draft, Chára was drafted in the third round, 56th overall, by the New York Islanders at the 1996 NHL entry draft. He would spend his first season in North America with the Western Hockey League (WHL)&#x27;s Prince George Cougars, who subsequently selected Chára in that year&#x27;s CHL Import Draft. Chára spent four seasons with the Islanders organization, becoming a reliable, stay-at-home defender in a primarily defensive role. He earned a reputation as a tough player to play against – intimidating, physically strong and a punishing hitter who could, on occasion, fight. His physical strength also gave him a very hard slap shot, which seemed to improve each and every season, although Chára was never deployed in an offensive role as an Islander. Chára was traded to the Ottawa Senators during the 2001 NHL entry draft as part of a deal to acquire forward Alexei Yashin. At the time, it was believed the deal would vastly improve the Islanders, who were never a contending team when Chára played there. Chára was part of a package deal that included Bill Muckalt and the second overall pick from that year&#x27;s draft, which the Senators used to select Jason Spezza. The Islanders initially had a trade in place to send Chára to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Jason Allison, but team ownership nixed the deal because it would have involved Dave Scatchard, who they did not want to trade because they &quot;liked Dave Scatchard because he visited sick kids in the hospital.&quot;

===Ottawa Senators (2001–2006)===

The Senators knew from observation Chára would be a reliable defender, and were also aware he was growing into his body and improving his skills each year. However, Chára grew in ways that exceeded all expectations. In 2001–02, during his first year in Ottawa, he recorded new career highs in goals (10) and points (23) as he turned into a bona fide two-way defenceman. His powerful slapshot continued to improve, and Ottawa began to deploy him on the power play to use it, something the Islanders had rarely done. It resulted in four of Chára&#x27;s goals being scored with the man advantage that season. The following year, in 2002–03, Chára began to blossom into an elite NHL defenceman. He posted new career highs with 30 assists and 39 points and became one of Ottawa&#x27;s top two defenders, along with Wade Redden. He also earned his first NHL All-Star Game appearance, where he recorded the second-hardest shot behind Al MacInnis in the Skills Competition.

In 2003–04, Chára posted career bests with 16 goals and 41 points, and recorded the NHL&#x27;s third highest plus-minus rating, behind Martin St. Louis and Marek Malík, culminating in his first James Norris Memorial Trophy nomination. Although he lost to Scott Niedermayer as the NHL&#x27;s top defenceman, he joined Niedermayer on the NHL first All-Star team.

After the 2004–05 NHL lockout, in which Chára played in the Swedish Elitserien for Färjestad BK, he matched his previous NHL season&#x27;s 16-goal total and tallied a career best 43 points, good enough for NHL second All-Star team honors. Following the season, Ottawa was faced with the possible loss of its two top defencemen – Chára and Redden – and finances dictated they could only sign one; the Senators opted for Redden.

As Chára did not come to terms on a new contract with Ottawa, he became an unrestricted free agent at the end of 2005–06. Choosing Redden over Chára proved to be a mistake, as Redden&#x27;s performance declined whereas Chára became one of the league&#x27;s top defencemen.

===Boston Bruins (2006–2020)===

On 1 July 2006, the first day of the free agency period, Chára signed a five-year, $37.5 million contract with the Boston Bruins and was named the team&#x27;s captain, a role left vacant since Joe Thornton&#x27;s departure to San Jose during the 2005–06 season. Chára became only the third Slovak-born NHL player to become a team captain, after Peter Šťastný of the Quebec Nordiques and Stan Mikita (co-captain) of the Chicago Blackhawks. Chára was named to the 2007 NHL All-Star Game (his second appearance) in Dallas and scored two goals in a 12–9 Eastern Conference loss. Chára also won the hardest shot segment of the preceding Skills Competition, clocking a shot at 100.4 mph. While his season was a personal success for many of these reasons, the Bruins were in a rebuilding mode at the time, and the signing was questioned throughout the NHL, as Chára posted an uncharacteristic −21 plus-minus rating that season due to the Bruins&#x27; struggles. However, his 32 assists were a new career high.

In 2007–08, Chára was voted a starter in the 2008 NHL All-Star Game, the first time in his career he received such All-Star Game honours. He repeated as the winner of the hardest shot competition, recording an even-faster 103.1 mph (166 km/h) on the radar gun. On 8 March 2008, during a game against the Washington Capitals, Chára suffered a torn labrum in his left shoulder. However, after missing five games, he played the remainder of the season, including the 2008 playoffs. Upon a first-round elimination at the hands of the Montreal Canadiens, he underwent a shoulder operation on 29 April. At the end of the season, Chára received his second nomination for the Norris Trophy after tallying a career-high 17 goals, 34 assists and 51 points, marking the fifth-straight season he had either matched or bested his previous season&#x27;s points total. The Bruins improved tremendously this season, and the critics who had questioned the Bruins&#x27; signing of Chára the previous season were largely silenced by his, and the team&#x27;s, improved play.
In 2008–09, Chára was named to his fourth All-Star Game. As back-to-back champion of the hardest shot competition, Chára initiated a charity drive among the participants ($1,000 per player) to go to the charity of choice of the competition&#x27;s winner. The 2009 installation of the event featured additional intrigue, as three players widely considered to possess the hardest shots in the NHL (Chára, Sheldon Souray and Shea Weber) had all been chosen as All-Stars, and therefore would participate in the event. Having raised $24,000 from the six competitors and their respective teams, the NHL and the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA), Chára set a new Skills Competition record with a 105.4 mph (169.7 km/h) slapshot. He donated the winnings to Right to Play, and due to Chára&#x27;s leading role in fundraising for charity, the hardest shot competition that year was punningly dubbed a &quot;Chara&quot;ty event. The shot passed Al Iafrate&#x27;s previous record of 105.2 mph (169.3 km/h) from the 1993 competition. During the season, Chára posted a career best 19 goals and eclipsed his career best points total, reaching the 50-point plateau for the second consecutive year with a goal and an assist in his final game of the season. For his efforts, he won his first Norris Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s best defenceman, edging Mike Green of the Washington Capitals and Nicklas Lidström of the Detroit Red Wings.

Chára would post another standout season in 2009–10, scoring 44 points. His goal total fell to seven from the year before, but his play was as strong as ever, leading the Bruins to lock him up long-term with a contract extension; on 9 October 2010, he re-signed with the Bruins on a seven-year contract.

In 2010–11, Chára&#x27;s 14 goals and 44 points were another strong campaign, leading to yet another All-Star selection and new heights as his slapshot continued to break records at the 2011 All-Star Game in Raleigh, North Carolina. He eclipsed his own previous record with a shot clocked at 105.9 mph (170.43 km/h). He also achieved a personal milestone that is exceptionally rare for a defenceman; on 17 January 2011, Chára recorded his first career hat-trick against the Carolina Hurricanes in a 7–0 victory. He celebrated the feat by performing retired Slovak NHL star Peter Bondra&#x27;s celebration, where he mimed throwing a hat into the air. On 8 March 2011, Chára hit and drove Montreal Canadiens forward Max Pacioretty&#x27;s head directly into an off-ice stanchion at the end of the bench, knocking him unconscious. Pacioretty was taken off the ice on a stretcher. The extent of the injury was revealed the next day to be a non-displaced fracture to the 4th vertebra and a severe concussion. For delivering the hit, Chára received a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct, and videotape of the play was sent to NHL vice president of hockey operations Mike Murphy for review. However, Murphy decided no further punishment was warranted, calling it a &quot;hockey play&quot;. Although a criminal investigation was announced by the Montreal Police Service immediately after the incident, the Crown Prosecutor Office announced on 17 November 2011, that Chára would not be criminally charged. Pacioretty eventually made a full recovery, returning to Montreal the following season. The following season the NHL tested and later mandated a change to its rinks to have a curved glass at the end of the player benches to deflect similar impact. The 2010–11 season culminated in the ultimate glory for Chára, as he captained the Bruins to win the Stanley Cup against the Vancouver Canucks, the Boston team&#x27;s first Stanley Cup championship win since 1972. In so doing, Chára became the first Slovak to captain a Stanley Cup champion, and only the second European to do so after Nicklas Lidström of Sweden for the Detroit Red Wings. He also became the first player born in a country behind the Iron Curtain to captain a Stanley Cup winner.

At the 2012 All-Star Game&#x27;s Hardest Shot skill competition, Chára yet again raised his measured hardest slap shot velocity to another record, attaining 108.8 mph (175.1 km/h). Runner-up Shea Weber surpassed Chara&#x27;s 2011 event record by recording a 106.0 mph blast in the same contest, but Chára&#x27;s performance ensured he kept his title.
Chára is widely considered to have the hardest slapshot in the NHL, and quite possibly the world – the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) claims the world record belongs to Alex Riazantsev at 114.1 mph, but due to differences in the mechanics of the KHL competition, the NHL does not recognize this figure. Chára won the hardest shot competition at the All-Star Game Skills Competition five times in a row, in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012 (Note: there was no NHL All-Star Game in 2010, due to NHL player participation in the 2010 Winter Olympics, and also in 2013 as a result of the 2012–13 NHL lockout). Chára played his 1,000th career NHL game on 24 March 2012 against the Los Angeles Kings, and it ended with a 4–2 victory for the Bruins.

During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Chara agreed to play for Lev Praha of the KHL until NHL play resumed. He returned from the lockout to post another solid season, with 7 goals and 12 assists in the 48-game season. His point totals were down due to some of Boston&#x27;s struggles down the stretch, particularly on the power play, where Chára only posted one assist all season despite plenty of ice time in man advantage situations. However, he remained solid on defence and a key contributor for the Bruins. In the 2013 playoffs, he was physically dominant and played a key role in leading his team to the Finals.

Following the 2013–14 season, Chára was named a finalist for the Norris Trophy. He was nominated along with eventual winner Duncan Keith and Shea Weber. Chára finished runner-up in the voting.
By the time the 2016–17 season had started, Chára was skating as part of the Bruins&#x27; top defensive pairing beside 6-foot-5-inch rookie defenceman Brandon Carlo, nearly 20 years younger than him.

A similar &quot;pairing&quot; for Chára occurred as the 2017–18 season got going: the American-born star rookie defenceman Charlie McAvoy had, by mid-November of the new Bruins season, become Chára&#x27;s latest &quot;regular&quot; defensive partner for the Bruins. By early February 2018, Chára played in his 1,400th NHL game in a 4–1 home ice defeat of the Toronto Maple Leafs, only the 39th player in NHL history to reach the milestone. On 28 March 2018, the Bruins re-signed Chára to a one-year, $5 million contract extension.

On 17 April 2019, in game 4 of the first round series between the Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs, Chára became the oldest defenceman in NHL history to score a game-winning goal in the Stanley Cup playoffs. On 9 June 2019, during game 6 of the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals against the St. Louis Blues, Chára scored an empty net goal and as a result became the oldest defenceman in NHL history to score a goal in the Stanley Cup Finals.

On 10 July 2019, following the retirement of Matt Cullen, Chára became the oldest active NHL player. On 5 November 2019, during a game at the Bell Centre against the Montreal Canadiens, Chára became the 21st player in NHL history to play 1,500 regular season games.

===Washington Capitals (2020–2021)===
On 30 December 2020, Chára signed a one-year, $795,000 contract with the Washington Capitals. He scored his first goal with the team on 28 January 2021, against the New York Islanders.

===Return to the Islanders and retirement (2021–2022)===
On 18 September 2021, it was announced that Chára had signed a one-year contract with the New York Islanders. On 24 February 2022, Chára played his 1,652nd NHL game, surpassing Chris Chelios&#x27; record of 1,651 games played by a defenceman. At the end of the season, he was a finalist for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, awarded to the player who &quot;best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey&quot;.

On 20 September 2022, Chára announced his retirement from professional hockey. He signed a one-day contract with the Boston Bruins to officially retire as a member of the team.

==International==



Chára represented Slovakia in ten international tournaments, having played in the World Championships (1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2012) and the Olympics (2006, 2010, 2014). He won a World Championship silver medal in 2000, later captaining Slovakia to his second silver medal in 2012. He also competed in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey for Slovakia and the 2016 World Cup of Hockey for Team Europe.

During the 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony, Chára served as the flag bearer for Slovakia.

In 2020, Chára was named into the IIHF All-Time Slovakia Team.

==Personal life==
Before he was drafted into the NHL, Chára&#x27;s coaches in his native Slovakia attempted to persuade him to play basketball, due to his height. Also as a result of his height, Chára uses 67-inch sticks (four inches longer than NHL regulations), and received a waiver from the NHL to do so.

Chára married his long-time girlfriend Tatiana Biskupicová on 14 July 2007, in a Catholic church in Nemšová, Slovakia. Tatiana gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, daughter Elliz Victoria Chára (Chárová), on 27 April 2009. Their twin boys, Zack and Ben, were born on 7 March 2016. All three of their children were born in Boston. His father, Zdeněk Chára, was a prominent Greco-Roman wrestler.

Chára is an athletic ambassador for Right To Play. In July 2008, he spent two weeks in Africa, visiting Mozambique in support of the charity, and climbing Mount Kilimanjaro with former NHL player Robyn Regehr.

Chára was one of the first NHL players to endorse You Can Play and acceptance of gay players in professional hockey.

Chára is a polyglot, speaking six languages outside of his native Slovak: Czech, Polish, Swedish, Russian, German, and English. He also has a financial planning diploma from Ottawa&#x27;s Algonquin College. In early 2015, Chára received a license to sell real estate in Massachusetts.

Chára participated in the 2023 Boston Marathon to support the Hoyt Foundation and the Thomas E. Smith Foundation, finishing with a time of 3:38:23. During Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Finals at TD Garden, the Boston Celtics honored Chára with the Heroes Among Us award in honor of his community service across New England. The Heroes Among Us award is the Celtics&#x27; community outreach award dating back to 1997.

<text>Plus−minus (+/−, ±, plus/minus) is a sports statistic used to measure a player&#x27;s impact, represented by the difference between their team&#x27;s total scoring versus their opponent&#x27;s when the player is in the game.

==Ice hockey==
In ice hockey, the plus–minus measures a player&#x27;s goal differential. When a team that is at even-strength or shorthanded scores a goal, all players on the ice on the scoring team will register a plus while all players on the conceding team on the ice will register a minus. When a goal is scored by a team on the power play, no plus or minus points are awarded to either team. Empty net situations are treated the same as even-strength unless the team that scores is on the power play. Penalty shot goals are excluded.

A player&#x27;s plus−minus statistic is calculated for each game played. The statistic is directly affected by overall team performance, influenced by both the offensive and defensive performance of the team as a whole. However, there is controversy in the effectiveness of the plus−minus statistic&#x27;s ability to accurately convey a players individual performance.

=== History ===
The plus/minus statistic was first used in the 1950s by the Montreal Canadiens, a National Hockey League (NHL) team, for evaluating its own players. Plus-minus was hockey&#x27;s first enhanced statistic, becoming an official NHL statistic in 1959-60.

=== Situational plus–minus ===
There are some drawbacks to the traditional calculation of the plus–minus statistic in ice hockey. Not all types of goals are included, specifically power play goals. Every goal included in the calculation is weighted the same regardless of the situation - even strength, power play, short-handed or empty net. Also, traditional plus–minus is not applied to goaltenders.

Situational plus–minus (Sit +/−) is an alternative calculation that takes into account all types of &quot;team-based&quot; goals, which excludes only penalty shot and shootout goals. Each goal is weighted based on the number of skaters (i.e. not goaltenders) on the ice. The plus–minus rating is calculated by dividing the number of skaters on the ice for the team scored upon by the number of skaters on the ice for the scoring team, applied as a plus to all players (including goaltenders) on the ice for the scoring team and as a minus for all players (including goaltenders) on the ice for the team scored upon.

=== Awards ===
The NHL introduced the Plus-Minus Award in the 1982-83 season, awarded to the top plus player for that season that played in at least 60 games. The award was named the Emery Edge Award and was won in the inaugural season by Charlie Huddy of the Edmonton Oilers.

The award was last given for the 2007-08 season. At this point the award was named Bud Light Plus/Minus Award and was won by Pavel Datsyuk of the Detroit Red Wings.

==Basketball==
Although the statistic was pioneered in the sport of hockey, it has found its way into use in other sports and areas of life. In basketball, the NBA&#x27;s Houston Rockets first utilized a modified version of the stat, which indicated that Shane Battier, who had a plus–minus score of plus 10, was a much more effective player than had been previously believed.

==Association football==
A plus−minus statistic has been used in sports economics to analyze the degree of competitive balance over time in association football.

<text>The Russian News Agency TASS, or simply TASS, is a Russian state-owned news agency founded in 1904. It is the largest Russian news agency and one of the largest news agencies worldwide.

TASS is registered as a Federal State Unitary Enterprise, owned by the government of Russia. Headquartered in Moscow, it has 70 offices in Russia and in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), &quot;along with 56 global branches in 53 countries&quot;.

In the Soviet period, it was named the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union () and was the central agency of the Soviet government for news collection and distribution for all Soviet newspapers, radio and television stations. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it was renamed Information Telegraph Agency of Russia (ITAR-TASS) () in 1992, but reverted to the simpler TASS name in 2014. Currently, on a daily basis TASS is &quot;publishing nearly 3,000 news items in six languages and about 700 photographs and videos from correspondents in Russia and across the world&quot;.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated TASS to be &quot;State Controlled Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

== History ==
=== 1902: TTA, SPTA, PTA, ROSTA ===
The origin of TASS dates back to December 1902 when it began operations as the Commercial Telegraph Agency (TTA, Torgovo-Telegrafnoe Agentstvo) under the Ministry of Finance, with Torgovo-Promyshlennaya Gazeta&#x27;s staff being the main supplier of journalists. As the demand for non-business news began during the first battles of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, the agency changed its name to the St. Petersburg Telegraph Agency (SPTA). As there was no change of headquarters and almost no change in its staff and function, it was a mere rebranding.

In August 1914, one day after St. Petersburg was renamed Petrograd, SPTA was renamed the Petrograd Telegraph Agency (PTA). It was seized by the Bolsheviks in November 1917 and by December was renamed as the Central Information Agency of the Soviet Russian Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. On 7 September 1918, the presidium renamed PTA and the Press bureau into the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA), which became &quot;the central information agency of the whole Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic&quot;.

=== 1925: TASS ===
On July 10, 1925, the &quot;Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (Телеграфное агентство Советского Союза, Telegrafnoye agentstvo Sovetskogo Soyuza, TASS)&quot; was established by a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and took over the duties of the ROSTA as the country&#x27;s central information agency. TASS enjoyed &quot;exclusive right to gather and distribute information outside the Soviet Union, as well as the right to distribute foreign and domestic information within the Soviet Union, and manage the news agencies of the Soviet republics&quot;. Official state information was delivered as the &quot;TASS Report&quot; (, &quot;Soobshchyeniye TASS&quot;).

TASS included affiliated news agencies in all 14 (in 1940–56, 15) Soviet republics in addition to Russia: RATAU (Ukrainian SSR, now Ukrinform), BelTA (Byelorussian SSR), ETA (Estonian SSR), Latinform (Latvian SSR, now LETA), ELTA (Lithuanian SSR), ATEM (Moldavian SSR, now Moldpres), Armenpress (Armenian SSR), Gruzinform (Georgian SSR), Azerinform (Azerbaijan SSR, now AZERTAC), UzTAG (Uzbek SSR, now UzA), KazTAG (Kazakh SSR, now Kazinform), KyrTAG (Kyrgyz SSR, now Kabar), Turkmeninform (Turkmen SSR, now TDH) and TajikTA (Tajik SSR, now Khovar). Over the history other affiliates existed, e.g. KarelfinTAG for the short-lived Karelo-Finnish SSR (1940–56). In addition to producing reports for general consumption, TASS produced packages of content for non-public use. Western news reports and potentially embarrassing domestic news would be compiled daily into a collection known as &quot;White Tass&quot;, and particularly sensitive news would be compiled into a smaller collection known as &quot;Red Tass&quot;. These collections were made available only to top journalists and political leaders, respectively.

In 1961, Ria Novosti was created to supplement TASS, mainly in foreign reporting and human-interest stories. After 1971, TASS was elevated to the status of State Committee at the Government of the Soviet Union.

The agency was frequently used as a front organization by the Soviet intelligence agencies, such as the NKVD (later KGB) and Main Intelligence Directorate, with TASS employees serving as informants abroad. In 1959, Alexander Alexeyev was dispatched to Cuba on a fact-finding mission, ostensibly working for TASS. Former Georgetown University professor James David Atkinson stated that TASS was an &quot;effective propaganda medium&quot; but that it concentrated &quot;more heavily on espionage than on other activities.&quot; TASS frequently served as a vector for Soviet active measures.

=== 1992: ITAR-TASS ===
In January 1992, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a Presidential Decree signed by Boris Yeltsin re-defined the status of TASS and renamed it the &quot;Information Telegraph Agency of Russia&quot;. In May 1994, the Russian Government adopted a resolution &quot;On approval of the Charter of the Information Telegraph Agency of Russia&quot;, under which it operates as a central government news agency. The TASS acronym was, by this point, well-recognized around the world and so was retained after being redefined as the &quot;Telegraph agency of communication and messages&quot; (). The agency as a whole was referred to as &quot;ITAR-TASS&quot;.

In September 2014, the agency reverted to its former name as the &quot;Russian News Agency TASS&quot;.

== Organization ==
TASS is registered as a Federal State Unitary Enterprise, owned by the Government of Russia. Headquartered in Moscow, TASS has 70 offices in Russia and in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), as well as 68 bureaus around the world.

=== TASS press center ===
TASS multi-media press center is a communication floor in the heart of Moscow. Every year it hosts some 300 events featuring high-ranking Russian officials, foreign heads of state, leaders of main political parties, representatives of the world of arts and culture, scientists and sporting personalities as well as managers of Russian and foreign business enterprises. TASS press centers also operate in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk.

TASS is a media partner of high-profile conferences, forums and exhibitions in Russia and abroad. The agency organized the first News Agencies World Congress (NAWC) in 2004.

=== TASS building ===
TASS is headquartered in a building in the Soviet brutalist style built in 1977. In November 2021, an association of Russian architects criticized plans by Moscow city authorities to renovate the building without due regard for the preservation of its historic appearance.

== Controversies and criticisms ==
TASS has been cited as a source of disinformation as part of Russian influence operations.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===
* On 27 February 2022, &quot;under the circumstances of the new media regulation enforced by the Russian government, which is heavily restricting media freedom&quot;, the European Alliance of News Agencies (EANA) unanimously decided to suspend TASS as &quot;not being able to provide unbiased news&quot;, pending an exclusion decision.
* In March 2022, Getty Images, after &quot;monitoring Russian state news agency TASS closely since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine&quot; decided to end its partnership with TASS for what it said was violating editorial policy.

 examples of propagation of disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine are as follows:

* TASS quoted Vyacheslav Volodin&#x27;s false claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fled Kyiv following the invasion. Zelenskyy used social media to post statements, videos and photos to counter this Russian disinformation.
* TASS made unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine was making a nuclear dirty bomb.

Zack and his close friends Kimberly Hart, Jason Lee Scott, Billy Cranston and Trini Kwan were picked as the five original Power Rangers by the wise sage Zordon to defend Earth from the evil sorceress Rita Repulsa. After traveling through time Zack was chosen as the Black Power Ranger, gaining the Mastodon Power Coin and the Mastodon Dinozord.

Quick-witted and clever, Zack relies on a combination of skill, strength, and agility to win his battles. The original Black Ranger is an energetic, charismatic, and fun-loving young man. He enjoys athletics (such as basketball, American football, and scuba diving), dancing (especially to a fresh beat bumping out of his friend&#x27;s boombox), parties, and girls. Whenever he didn&#x27;t have an arm around Trini or Kimberly, Zack could be found pursuing his attractive, but hard-to-get classmate, Angela. Zack always loved a good joke. Though he loved all the people close to him, Zack&#x27;s best friend was clearly Jason. Zack is extremely confident and positive. Only four occasions saw Zack ready to give it up: when the Green Ranger took out Zordon, Alpha 5 and the Command Center while removing the Rangers from the Megazord; when his team was placed under a spell to take away their confidence; and when their Dinozords were commandeered by Lord Zedd&#x27;s first monster, Pirantishead. But the first occasion happened very early in the series when his friends pretended to have forgotten his birthday. Zack went off into a secluded area, and into a trap by Rita Repulsa. For some time, he had to fight the powerful Knasty Knight alone. Oddly enough, despite his plentiful confidence, Zack is an extreme ophidiophobe, arachnophobe, and entomophobe meaning he is terrified of snakes, spiders, and insects although, on one occasion when performing magic for a group of children seeking shelter from a monster attack, he handled two fake snakes and used them to scare off Bulk and Skull. Because of this, it can be assumed that Zack&#x27;s fear of snakes deteriorated over time, especially after an encounter on Rita&#x27;s Island of Illusion where his strength of will was tested against his fear of snakes.

Zack enjoyed martial arts just as much as he did dancing and, as a result, created his own fighting style, called Hip Hop kido. The customized art consisted of dance-like maneuvers flourished with fast and powerful strikes, much like Capoeira or as seen by actor Daniel O&#x27; Neill in Bangkok Adrenaline. This effective combination of power and prowess made Zack an incredibly formidable combatant.
However, he would sometimes tone down his style and mimic the attacks of Billy to simultaneously strike opponents.
He was also very resourceful. On several occasions, it was his cunning that led his team to victory. Such occasions included his discovery of the means to overcome the Knasty Knight who was sent to isolate and destroy him on his birthday- the monster possessed the ability to redistribute the Ranger&#x27;s force in order to fry the weapons they used against him. When the storm-bringing chimera monster Goatan froze the Megazord, Zack analyzed what little resources the Megazord had left and used it to regain dominance in the battle.

After Tommy Oliver joined the team, he and Zack quickly became close friends as a result of their similar interests. When Tommy was nervous about trying to engage a romantic relationship with Kimberly, it was Zack who Tommy sought for advice. Before Tommy appeared (or if Tommy is not at the Youth Center) Zack is usually Jason&#x27;s sparring partner when practicing Karate. Tommy and Zack would also act as sparring partners for each other, as well. Though Jason was the Ranger Tommy selected to take on his Green Ranger powers after Rita eliminated Tommy&#x27;s link to the Morphing Grid, Zack is the only other individual to don the Dragon Shield when Tommy gave it to him so that its enhanced regenerative powers could heal Zack from the Oysterizer monster&#x27;s acidic attack.

In the Season 2 episode &quot;Green No More, Part 1&quot;, Zack&#x27;s cousin Curtis was introduced, who would have a small recurring role throughout the middle of the season. Curtis was very similar to Zack due to their similar interests in dance and music, as well as their smooth-talking speech pattern. He also formed a friendship with Trini&#x27;s crush Richie. The two once even managed to fight off a group of Putties while they were skating.

When Walter Jones (Zack), Austin St. John (Jason), and Thuy Trang (Trini) left the show (over contract disputes), their characters stopped making new on-screen or face-to-camera shots- simply being shown in their Ranger uniforms, using old footage, or with doubles who were never directly facing the cameras- before they were written off in the two-part &quot;Power Transfer&quot; episode in which their characters were chosen to attend the World Peace Conference. Zack&#x27;s powers were transferred to Adam Park. Though Jason later returned in &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and the tenth anniversary special &quot;Forever Red,&quot; it was never stated what became of Trini or Zack after the peace conference, although Jones did return to the show in a few episodes in Power Rangers Lost Galaxy and Power Rangers Wild Force mainly doing voicework for monsters and villains.

====&quot;Power Rangers Super Megaforce&quot;====
During the final episode of &quot;Power Rangers Super Megaforce&quot; - &quot;Legendary Battle&quot; - the Black Mighty Morphin Power Ranger participates in the eponymous battle alongside other past and present Power Rangers. It is presumed to be Zack wielding the Mastodon Power Coin as Adam is seen fighting as the Green Zeo Ranger. Regardless, Emanuel Jones does not reprise the role for this morphed appearance.

====&quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot;====
The Black Mighty Morphin Power Ranger makes another appearance for the second season episode of &quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot;, &quot;Grid Connection&quot;. The episode saw Austin St. John reprise the role as Jason Lee Scott, the Red Mighty Morphin Power Ranger. Jason summons the other four core Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the Dino Thunder rangers to join him and the Dino Charge rangers in battling a resurrected Goldar Maximus. Again, Emanuel Jones did not return; the Black Ranger has no dialogue and remains morphed throughout the appearance so it is unclear if Zack or Adam answered the call.

====&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once and Always&quot;====
For Hasbro PulseCon 2022, Walter Emanuel Jones announced he would reprise the role of Zack to mark the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise. &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once and Always&quot; was released on Netflix on April 19, 2023.

In the special, it is revealed that Zack became a Congressman following his time at the Peace Conference. However, when Trini is killed by Robo-Rita - the evil spirit of Rita Repulsa inhabiting a robot body - he steps down to care for Trini&#x27;s teenage daughter, Minh. Though Minh comes to see &quot;Uncle Zack&quot; as a surrogate father figure, she is openly resentful to Billy, who caused Rita&#x27;s restoration. Minh becomes vengeful and begins training in the hope of destroying Rita.

One year later, Robo-Rita reappears and captures Tommy, Jason, and Kimberly. She plans to drain their energy to power a time machine that will allow her to contact her past self and alter the timeline in her favor. While Zack and Billy lead the remaining Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Rangers - a team consisting of themselves, Kat and Rocky - to defend Angel Grove and thwart Rita&#x27;s plan, Minh steals Trini&#x27;s morpher to join the fight but finds herself unable to use it. Echoing Zordon, Zack counsels her to use her skills to defend life, rather than for revenge.

During the final battle with Robo-Rita, Minh sacrifices herself to save Billy. This action bonds her to the Sabre-Toothed Tiger Power Coin, which saves her and allows her to morph into the Yellow Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Ranger. Zack uses the Power Axe&#x27;s cannon mode to destroy Rita once and for all, saying Trini&#x27;s name before delivering the final blow.

===Film===
====&quot;Power Rangers&quot; (2017)====

Zack appears in the 2017 film reboot, played by Chinese-Canadian actor Ludi Lin. He is initially introduced as a school truant with an apparent need for adrenaline, willing to attempt the team&#x27;s more extreme stunts, such as jumping over a chasm. In the course of the film, it is revealed that he lives in a mobile home park with his ill mother, and Zack is her only carer. Zack is bilingual, speaking English, and using Mandarin Chinese to communicate with his mother. He is the first Ranger to try and pilot his zord, despite being told that it is only controllable once they have morphed, taking the Mastodon on a run through the hills. He rallies in time to assist the team in facing Rita in the final battle.

===Comics===
====&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Pink&quot;====
Kimberly is the main character in this comic book mini series published by Boom! Studios. The series is a modern remake but also serves as a continuation from Kimberly&#x27;s exit in the third season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Kimberly needs to rescue a French town under siege from Goldar. She seeks help from Zordon who uses the Sword of Light to activate the latent pink energy within her. Kimberly then teleports to Zack and Trini in South America for their help. Zordon uses the Sword of Light to share Kimberly&#x27;s power with them. Zack once again becomes the black ranger. It is also revealed that Zack and Trini are in a relationship.

===Other Appearances===
====&quot;Power/Rangers&quot; (2015 short film) ====
In &quot;Power/Rangers&quot; Zack Taylor (played by Gichi Gamba), in this much darker satirical reimagining, in this timeline the Machine Empire defeats the Power Rangers and destroys the Megazord in battle, Earth&#x27;s governments negotiate a truce with the Machine Empire and the Power Rangers are disbanded. Zack an insatiable action junkie and &quot;Hip Hop Kido&quot; workout instructor who became a Machine Empire enforcer (seen taking down the North Korean Kim and his goons personally), he also has a relationship with Divatox and Scorpina and has also become a cocaine addict, he is murdered by Rita Repulsa disguised as Kimberly Hart.

==Reception==
The choice of color for the Black Ranger (Zack Taylor) and Yellow Ranger (Trini Kwan) have been a source of criticism, due to the belief these colors are representations of their racial backgrounds. There are many parodies illustrating the perceived inherent racism of the show. According to the producers, this was not noticed until the tenth episode of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;.

<text>Kenneth Searight (born Arthur Kenneth Searight) (15 November 1883–28 February 1957) was the creator of the international auxiliary language Sona. His book &quot;Sona; an auxiliary neutral language&quot; outlines the language&#x27;s grammar and vocabulary. Encounters with Searight also influenced English author E.M. Forster&#x27;s world-view, particularly with regard to soldiers.

Searight was born in Kensington, England in 1883. He attended Charterhouse School (a boarding school) for his childhood and teenage years. In 1904 he received a commission into the Queen&#x27;s Own Western Kent Regiment, and was stationed for several years in India. It was here that he befriended English author E.M. Forster (&quot;A Passage to India&quot;) and Cambridge don G.L. Dickinson. His regiment was later reassigned to Iraq, and then to Egypt. Searight also enjoyed leave time around the Mediterranean Sea—especially in Italy.

It was during this extensive travel that Searight developed his interest in linguistics and his familiarity with Middle Eastern and Far Eastern languages and cultures. At one point in his military career he was classified as an interpreter competent in &quot;Arabic, Baluchi, Persian and Pushtu.&quot;

Searight retired to Rome in 1926. In 1934 he contacted Charles Kay Ogden to discuss publishing the Sona book. Ogden was the creator of a modified version of English known as &quot;Basic English&quot;, which consisted of a reduced vocabulary (only 850 words) and simplified grammar. Ogden was also the editor of the Psyche Miniatures series at Cambridge University, and he approved and published the Sona book, as well as writing an introduction for it.

Searight engaged in pederasty. He was also the author of six unpublished volumes of erotica, five of which were destroyed by a later owner in a moment of panic. The sixth survives: a 600-page manuscript work called the . It was made up of homoerotic stories, a detailed listing of his sexual conquests with a total of 129 boys — the &quot;Paidiology&quot;— and a 137-page verse autobiography entitled &quot;The Furnace&quot;.

There is some reason to believe that Searight was the model for the hero of Forster&#x27;s novel &quot;Maurice&quot;.

Ogden originally received the &quot;Paidikion&quot;, but it was later retrieved from a used bookstore for half a crown. Excerpts were published in the &quot;International Journal of Greek Love&quot; in 1966. The original manuscript is now kept in the Human Sexuality Collection at Cornell University (Rare Books Division, 7745 Bd. Ms. 1).

Searight died in 1957.

<text>Dr. Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Oliver is a fictional character in the American live-action television franchise &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. He is best known as being the original Green Ranger and the first evil Ranger who fought and nearly defeated the original Power Rangers while under the control of Rita Repulsa. He was eventually freed from Rita&#x27;s spell and aligned himself with the other Power Rangers. He is a main character in the &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; TV series, as well as four of its successive incarnations &quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot;, and &quot;Power Rangers Dino Thunder&quot; (where he returns as a legendary Power Ranger veteran). He also appeared in the &quot;Power Rangers Wild Force&quot; episode &quot;Forever Red&quot;, the &quot;Power Rangers S.P.D.&quot; episode &quot;Wormhole&quot;, the &quot;Power Rangers Super Megaforce&quot; episode &quot;Legendary Battle&quot;, and in the &quot;Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel&quot; episode &quot;Dimensions in Danger&quot;. He was portrayed by actor Jason David Frank in all of his appearances from the Zordon era until Saban Brands era&#x27;s seasons of the franchise prior to his death in November 2022, with the exception of the episode &quot;Wormhole&quot;, where he appeared only in Ranger form and was voiced by actor Jeffrey Parazzo (who played Trent Mercer in &quot;Dino Thunder&quot;). He was also infrequently portrayed by actor Michael Gotto in instances where the story required the character during childhood, such as in the series &quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot;.

According to the character&#x27;s history, Tommy is a legend among the Power Rangers community and is considered to be the greatest Power Ranger of all time, having been six different Power Rangers — The Green Ranger, The White Ranger, The White Ninja Ranger, Zeo Ranger V – Red, The Red Turbo Ranger, and The Black Dino Ranger — and a part of four Ranger teams over the years. In addition, Tommy is a lifelong practitioner of the martial arts; during the first season of &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, he was referred to as having a third-degree black belt in karate. By &quot;Power Rangers Dino Thunder&quot;, he is a 6th degree black belt. (&quot;Return of the Ranger&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers Dino Thunder – Collision Course&quot; DVD). Tommy serves as a love interest to the original Pink Ranger Kimberly Hart before their separation. He later pursues a relationship with Kimberly&#x27;s successor Kat Hillard.

== Fictional character history ==

=== &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; ===

==== As the Green Ranger ====

Tommy Oliver is first introduced in the &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; five-part episode &quot;Green With Evil&quot; as a new student at Angel Grove High School. After he spars with Jason Lee Scott (Red Power Ranger) in a martial arts tournament, they begin to develop a friendship, and he catches the eye of both Kimberly Hart (Pink Power Ranger) and the evil witch Rita Repulsa. Rita decides to enchant Tommy to be her loyal servant, granting him the Dragon Power Coin to give him the power to morph into the evil Green Power Ranger. Unlike the other Power Rangers, his outfit includes a golden chest shield, two golden armbands, triangles instead of diamonds on the gloves and boots, and his power morpher was golden instead of silver. Tommy was the only ranger to also lack a blade blaster and instead carry his main weapon, The Dragon Dagger or Dragon Flute in his holster, which was black instead of white, at all times which had the ability to call on his zord. While under Rita&#x27;s spell, Tommy was completely under her control and followed every command given. He was also significantly stronger than the other Rangers and could fire powerful energy blasts from his hands. To ensure Tommy&#x27;s loyalty, Rita granted him the Sword of Darkness which not only made him more powerful but also made her spell indefinite unless the sword was destroyed.

She orders him to destroy the Power Rangers and their guardian Zordon so she may be able to conquer the Earth unopposed. He succeeds in his mission, dispatching Zordon, destroying the Power Rangers&#x27; Command Center, and infecting the robot Alpha 5 with a computer virus, leaving the Rangers defenseless against attacks, but they are still able to ward him off with the Megazord. With the return of Goldar&#x27;s wife Scorpina, the two wreak havoc in Angel Grove, leading the Power Rangers to use the Megazord once more, only to be attacked by Goldar, Scorpina, and the Green Ranger at once, putting the Megazord out of commission when it is thrown into the Earth&#x27;s core.

After this battle, the Power Rangers discover that their foe is none other than their classmate Tommy. After Tommy escapes, he is given the Dragon Dagger to summon the Dragonzord to attack the city. Zordon is revived and reveals the Power Rangers&#x27; Dinozords have been restored by the Earth&#x27;s lava, allowing them to counter the Dragonzord&#x27;s attack. The Red Ranger is then able to battle the Green Ranger one-on-one, and destroys the Sword of Darkness, freeing Tommy from Rita&#x27;s spell. Zordon then offers Tommy a spot on the team to atone for his misdeeds, and he agrees.

In the original draft script for the Green Dream, Lord Zedd claims the Sword of Power was created from the remains of the Sword of Darkness. This is also stated by the announcer&#x27;s intro to The Green Dream episode claiming it to be the Sword of Darkness.

During his time with the group, Tommy recognizes Kimberly&#x27;s feelings, having broken her heart while he was under Rita&#x27;s spell, and he now begins to show affections for her. However, Rita&#x27;s plan to use the evil Green Candle to get revenge on Tommy for leaving her employ, weakening Tommy, just as Kimberly returns his affections. Tommy is captured by Goldar and kept imprisoned in the Dark Dimension as the Green Candle burns down, draining him of his strength, due to the fact that Tommy&#x27;s presence within the proximity of the Candle accelerates the Candle&#x27;s burning process. Tommy is ultimately freed, but not before the Green Candle burns through completely. His powers nearly gone, after using them in one final battle with a powerful monster, he decides to give the Dragon Coin to Jason, permanently preventing Rita from attaining its power once more while allowing Jason to use Tommy&#x27;s weapons and the Dragonzord. Tommy then leaves Angel Grove to recover from the endeavour.

After Rita kidnaps all of the parents of the students of Angel Grove High School, the Power Rangers are forced to pay her ransom with their Power Coins, preventing them from using their powers. When they are double-crossed, and Rita acquires the Dragon Dagger by enchanting Billy Cranston, all seems hopeless, but Jason reveals he still has the Dragon Power Coin. The group finds Tommy once more, and with help from Zordon, Tommy is able to morph into the Green Ranger and retrieve the Power Coins and Dragon Dagger. However, his powers are now unstable and he requires constant energy boosts from Zordon in order to maintain his place as the Green Ranger.

With the arrival of the evil Lord Zedd in season 2, the other Power Rangers are given new Thunderzords to battle his stronger monsters, but because of Tommy&#x27;s unstable power reserves, the Dragonzord cannot be empowered into a new form. While under a spell Tommy suggests that if he had the Sword of Power that might increase his powers. When the other rangers agree they summon the Sword of Power together and Tommy&#x27;s evil spell was revealed. The spell wears off and Tommy fights Robogoat to recover the Sword of Power. With this knowledge in mind, Lord Zedd sends several energy draining monsters to steal the Green Ranger&#x27;s powers to the point where Zordon can no longer safely maintain himself and the Green Ranger. This culminates in the attack of the monster Turbanshell, who drains Tommy of his Green Ranger powers, trapping everyone in the Otherworld dimension, while charging the Dark Crystal to power Lord Zedd&#x27;s evil Dark Rangers to attack the Earth. Tommy uses the last of his powers to destroy the Dark Crystal, ending the reign of terror of the Dark Rangers and allowing the others to defeat Turbanshell. With his powers gone once again, Tommy leaves Angel Grove, again, spending time at his uncle&#x27;s lakeside cabin.

==== As the White Ranger ====
In season 2&#x27;s two-part &quot;White Light&quot; saga, Lord Zedd sends his monsters Nimrod, A.C., and D.C. to attack, who easily overpower the Power Rangers, leading Zordon and Alpha to come up with a plan to recruit a new Ranger. Initially the teens are put off at the idea of a newcomer out of their loyalty to Tommy, but are thrilled once they discover that it is actually Tommy himself, who has now become the White Power Ranger with his powers created by the Light of Goodness, which are unable to be stolen by the forces of evil. Unlike other Power Rangers, his costume includes a black and golden shield as well as a golden belt, golden bands instead of diamonds on the gloves and boots, a completely white suit without the diamond on the chest and the mouthpiece on his helmet lacks sculpted lips. After being installed as the team&#x27;s new leader (also becoming the main protagonist), Tommy goes into battle using his new powers to defeat the monsters, including summoning the Tigerzord with his talking saber Saba. Tommy then meets Rocky DeSantos, Adam Park and Aisha Campbell as they were trying to save a baby who belongs to their teacher.

After Rocky, Adam and Aisha discover Tommy&#x27;s identity as the White Ranger while Tommy and Kimberly were trying to save Billy by removing his helmet, Jason, Zack and Trini were called to the peace conference in Switzerland as Tommy transfers their powers to Rocky, Adam and Aisha and allows them to join the team. Tommy later contends with a clone of his named &quot;Tom&quot;, created and controlled by Lord Zedd&#x27;s Wizard of Deception, who is given the powers of the Green Ranger, restored by using portion of the White Ranger&#x27;s powers. With his worst fear from his past brought to life in front of him, Tommy battles Tom, initially seeks to destroy his clone under distress but he later recognizes that Tom is actually not evil but under the Wizard&#x27;s spell as he was under Rita&#x27;s, and then fights to save him. After the Wizard of Deception is destroyed during a series of battles that sends everyone back to the colonial era, Tom is freed from the spell and given free will. Tommy persuades his clone to fight to save people, and Tom decides to remain in the past to protect colonial Angel Grove despite Tommy offering Tom to join the Power Rangers, while the others return to the present time. Tom also keeps the Green Ranger powers.

==== As the White Ninja Ranger ====

In season 3, Rita&#x27;s brother Rito Revolto comes to Earth and manages to destroy the Rangers Zords and Power Coins. After the group seeks out the Power Coins creator Ninjor, he grants the team new Ninja Power Coins, and Tommy as the White Ninja Ranger receives the Falcon Power Coin and the new Falconzord. Later, Tommy meets Kat Hillard, who has been enchanted by Rita into serving her, resulting in Kimberly&#x27;s powers being stolen as well as the Falconzord. When Kimberly is kidnapped by Kat and Goldar, the Power Rangers are forced by Lord Zedd to use the Shogunzords to destroy the Earth or Kimberly will be harmed. While Billy manages to take control of the Zords away from Zedd, Tommy saves Kimberly and Kat by freeing her from Rita&#x27;s spell. When Kimberly is given the option to train for the Pan Global Games, she decides to give her powers to Kat, and she and Tommy keep a long-distance relationship. He and Kat also developed a close friendship due to their similar experiences with Rita; however, he is unaware that Kat is in love with him. The Falconzord is ultimately retrieved in time for Rita and Rito&#x27;s father Master Vile&#x27;s arrival on Earth, and the Rangers are able to use their new Metallic Armor to battle him. It is during this time that Tommy is tasked with retrieving the Zeo Crystal from beneath Rita and Zedd&#x27;s palace, as only a being of pure heart can pass through its force field and survive. Tommy manages to traverse the Caves of Deception to find the Zeo Crystal, and the team uses their powers to split it into five pieces and send it to different parts of history so Master Vile can never use its powers to harm the Earth.

=== &quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot; ===
In the events of &quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot;, Tommy, the other Power Rangers, and all of Angel Grove are sent back in time by Master Vile&#x27;s Orb of Doom, reverting the Power Rangers to children. While the Aquitian Rangers protect the Earth from Master Vile&#x27;s monsters, Billy manages to create a device to restore them to their original age, using their six Ninja Power Coins to power it. Billy is restored to his original age, but the machine is stolen by Rito and Goldar, and Rita and Zedd destroy the Ninja Power Coins. The five child Power Rangers are sent through time to retrieve the pieces of the Zeo Crystal. Tommy is sent to a point in the past on Native American land, where he meets Sam Trueheart who leads him to a test where he must find the Red Sub-Crystal amongst two fakes. After succeeding, Tommy returns to the present time, but not before Sam gives him half of an arrowhead pendant.

===&quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;===
During &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;, time is restored to normal and Tommy, with Kat, Rocky, Adam, and new friend Tanya Sloan replacing Aisha Campbell who chose to stay in Africa, is given the powers of the Zeo Crystal and the Zeo Rangers protect the Earth from the Machine Empire. Tommy remains the team&#x27;s leader and is assigned to be the Red Zeo Ranger. Later, Kimberly, while she is living in Florida for the Pan Global Games, sends Tommy a Dear John letter, ending their relationship. Kat attempts to find a new girlfriend for Tommy despite her feelings for him, but their duties as Power Rangers prevent any relationship from blossoming. Ultimately, Tommy and Kat begin dating. A holiday special during the season shows an elderly Tommy and Kat entertaining their granddaughter, and their teenaged grandson, who is hinted to be a Power Ranger. When the Zeo Megazord is heavily damaged, Tommy is given the Red Battlezord to control with his mind. Unable to control his emotions to use the Red Battlezord, Tommy goes on a spiritual journey to find peace of mind, and meets up with his long-lost twin brother David Truehart (portrayed by Jason David Frank&#x27;s real brother Erik Frank). He too possesses half of an arrowhead pendant, and he reveals to Tommy that if the two halves are joined the holder could use the spirits trapped within them to control a darkness powerful enough to destroy the world. When David is captured by King Mondo, Tommy frees him, and under the stress of protecting his brother from the Machine Empire who will not leave as they are both in trouble, he reveals his identity as a Power Ranger to him. When the Rangers&#x27; ally Trey of Triforia can no longer sustain his Gold Ranger powers after a battle, Tommy recruits Jason, who has returned from Switzerland to be the new temporary Gold Ranger, reuniting the old friends. This proves useful when Tommy is brainwashed by the Machine Empire&#x27;s Prince Gasket into thinking his friends are a threat to the world, as Jason and Kat are able to return Tommy to his senses. Jason leaves when Trey&#x27;s health is restored.

===&quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot;===

In &quot;&quot;, Tommy and Kat are sent to save the wizard Lerigot from the evil Space Pirate Divatox, who plans on wedding Maligore, a powerful monster, in order to take over the world. With their Zeo Ranger powers not strong enough, Tommy, with the other Power Rangers—and new member Justin Stewart replacing Rocky DeSantos due to a recent back injury—are given new powers to morph into the Turbo Rangers, with Tommy still serving as team leader as the Red Turbo Ranger. They use their new powers to save Jason and Kimberly, who have been kidnapped by Divatox as sacrifices for Maligore.

In &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot;, as he and his friends graduate from high school, Tommy becomes interested in stock car racing. The group also deals with the Blue Senturion who has been tricked by Divatox into thinking the Rangers are evil and preventing him from telling the Rangers the Millennium Message, a warning that the forces of evil are joining out in space. After Zordon and Alpha 5 leave the Earth to deal this threat, the team&#x27;s new guardian Dimitria eventually judges that Tommy, along with Kat, Adam, and Tanya, has fulfilled their duties as defenders of the Earth. In the episode &quot;Passing the Torch&quot;, Divatox&#x27;s mother Mama D convinces her that taking out Tommy will cause the fall of the rest of Power Rangers. Their new allies T.J. Johnson and Cassie Chan manage to help Kat fend off the Pirahantrons, and save Tommy from Divatox and Mama D&#x27;s plans, resulting in Tommy (who is leaving for MIT university to become a teacher) deciding that T.J. should be his successor as the new Red Turbo Ranger.

=== &quot;Power Rangers Wild Force&quot; ===
Five years after Tommy gave his powers to T.J., Tommy returns in the &quot;Power Rangers Wild Force&quot; episode &quot;Forever Red&quot;, where he is shown to own a resort with Bulk and Skull. Tommy leads a team made up of former Red Power Rangers, recruiting the current Red Ranger Cole Evans to help stop remnants of the Machine Empire from resurrecting Lord Zedd&#x27;s evil Zord Serpentera and attack the Earth. Tommy uses his Zeo Ranger powers to combat the enemies.

=== &quot;Power Rangers Dino Thunder&quot; ===

Between the events in &quot;Turbo&quot; and &quot;Power Rangers Dino Thunder&quot;, Tommy earns a PhD in paleontology at MIT. He also meets Hayley Ziktor and goes into business as partners with Terrence &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith and Dr. Anton Mercer, who together work on research that results in the creation of the Tyrannodrones, Raptor Riders, and the new Dinozords. A lab accident turns Mercer into the evil Mesogog, and Smitty is left for dead, until he is revived by Mesogog into the cyborg Zeltrax. It is during these events that Tommy discovers the Dino Gems, hiding them in his lab, and the location of the Shield of Triumph. While Mesogog gains control of the Tyrannodrones, Tommy keeps the Raptor Riders and Dinozords, working with Hayley to create equipment to harness the Dino Gems&#x27; powers, while he gets a job at Reefside High School as a science teacher. Three of his students who received detention—Conner McKnight, Ethan James, and Kira Ford—discover his lab and use three of the Dino Gems to become the new Dino Thunder Power Rangers.

Tommy mentors the group, keeping his past secret, until he discovers the monsters attacking Reefside are controlled by Mesogog. His three students soon discover the man they know as &quot;Dr. O&quot; was one of the previous Power Rangers, a fact that Hayley corrects them on by saying that he was one of the best. Tommy, using the powers of the Black Dino Gem, joins the group as the Black Dino Ranger, controlling the Brachiozord and gaining the power of invisibility.

When the White Dino Ranger appears, Tommy&#x27;s dedication to saving the lives of innocents seems to give the latter cause to show no mercy to him, even after he discovers that the White Dino Ranger is Trent Fernandez-Mercer, Anton&#x27;s adoptive son. For a while, Tommy is encased in amber by the White Dino Ranger, and once freed, finds himself unable to de-morph, due to his Dino Gem and his morpher re-molecularizing. He remains in his morphed form for a while. Despite this resolve, he cannot help but feel sympathy for Trent when his students did not, reminding the others of his tenure as the evil Green Power Ranger. After seeing the power of the White Ranger Clone and the Terrorsaurus, Tommy decides that the Rangers need an upgrade. He takes Trent to the location of the Shield of Triumph, as the shield can only be freed from its resting place by the power of Trent&#x27;s Dino Gem. The Shield is then used by Conner to become the Triassic Ranger, just as a prophecy Tommy had read during its discovery foretold.

Tommy is later freed from his permanently morphed status by a special substance, but is rendered invisible. He decides to run an experiment to return himself to normal, but it shatters the Black Dino Gem and leaves him comatose. In his subconscious, he battles against his previous Power Ranger alter-egos: Zeo Ranger V, the White Power Ranger, and then the Green Power Ranger. After proving that he will not give up the fight for his life, his inner selves each offer him a shattered piece of his Dino Gem, restoring him to full health and allowing him to attain Super Dino Mode when morphed. During his mentoring of the Dino Thunder Rangers, Tommy notes similarities in his past in Conner, placing a lot of trust into him. His mentoring of Conner through a point where the young man doubts himself, allows Conner to overcome these feelings and gain the Battlizer.

When Tommy learns that Trent has been keeping his father&#x27;s identity as Mesogog secret, Tommy considers removing Trent from the team. Although he comes to terms with Trent&#x27;s loyalty to his father, he asks the others if Trent should stay, and they agree when Trent saves Conner&#x27;s life. In the final battles against Zeltrax and Mesogog, having been liberated from sharing a body with Anton Mercer, Tommy informs the Rangers that they must give up their powers in order to save the world. Zeltrax is destroyed with the destruction of the Dinozords, and the Rangers give up their Dino Gems to stop Mesogog for good. In the end, Tommy decides to pursue his life after Mesogog&#x27;s destruction as a normal high school science teacher.

=== Later appearances ===
The character of Tommy Oliver is not present during the &quot;Power Rangers S.P.D.&quot; episode &quot;History&quot;, in which Conner, Kira, and Ethan go to their high school reunion in 2005, wondering if Tommy will arrive, only to be taken into the future by the S.P.D. Power Rangers&#x27; foe Broodwing. Tommy does return in the episode &quot;Wormhole&quot; when Emperor Grumm travels back in time to take over the Earth without S.P.D.&#x27;s interference, only to encounter the Dino Rangers. According to S.P.D. Red Ranger Jack Landors, Tommy&#x27;s services as a Power Ranger are well known in the future. In this episode, Jason David Frank didn&#x27;t reprise his role as Tommy Oliver, and as such only appears morphed. He was instead voiced by Jeffrey Parazzo, who also portrays Trent.

Although he doesn&#x27;t appear on screen in the &quot;Power Rangers Operation Overdrive&quot; two-part episode &quot;Once a Ranger&quot;, Kira mentions how Tommy would have enjoyed seeing the Operation Overdrive Power Rangers&#x27; base of operations, with Adam noting his incredulity that Tommy received a doctorate.

==== &quot;Power Rangers Super Megaforce&quot; ====
Jason David Frank reprised the role of Tommy Oliver in &quot;Power Rangers Super Megaforce&quot;. Tommy is first seen using Saba, the White Ranger&#x27;s sword, to rescue a boy from a car wreck caused by the Armada&#x27;s invasion. Later he is seen leading the team of Legendary Rangers, wielding his original Green Ranger powers, to aid the Megaforce Rangers in defeating the Armada.

==== &quot;Power Rangers Ninja Steel&quot; ====
In the &quot;Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel&quot; episode &quot;Dimensions in Danger&quot; — marking the 25th anniversary of &quot;Power Rangers&quot; — Tommy is captured by Lord Draven and replaced with a robot duplicate who traps several other past Rangers, including Kat and Rocky. He escapes and joins the Ninja Steel Rangers, Wes Collins, Gemma and Koda in rescuing the other Rangers. Tommy defeats his robot duplicate using the Master Morpher — a modified Power Morpher that allows him to access any of his previous Ranger forms — to call on the powers of Dino Thunder Black, Zeo Red and Mighty Morphin White and Green Rangers. As Lord Draven attempts to destroy the multiverse, the freed Legendary Rangers join the Ninja Steel Rangers in defeating Draven&#x27;s army and Tommy summons the Falconzord to thwart Draven&#x27;s final strike. The episode implies that Tommy and Kat are in a relationship and introduces Tommy&#x27;s son, J.J.

&quot;Dimensions in Danger&quot; marks the final live-action appearance of Jason David Frank in &quot;Power Rangers&quot; before his death in 2022.

==== &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot; ====
The 2023 Netflix special, &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;, marking 30 years of &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, shows Tommy (as the Green Ranger) fighting alongside the other original Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Rangers against Robo-Rita - the resurrected evil spirit of Rita Repulsa inhabiting a robot body. The battle culminates in Rita retreating after causing the death of Yellow Ranger, Trini.

One year later, Robo-Rita reappears with two of her resurrected monsters Robo-Minotaur and Robo-Snizzard. The latter captures Tommy, Jason, and Kimberly. Robo-Rita plans to drain their energy to power a time machine allowing her to contact her past self and alter the timeline in her favor. Billy and Zack lead a team with former rangers Kat and Rocky and Trini&#x27;s daughter Minh - who has inherited her mother&#x27;s powers - to rescue the captured Rangers and defeat Rita for good. This special confirms that Kat is J.J.&#x27;s mother and that she and Tommy are in a relationship.

Behind the scenes, Jason David Frank was invited to appear in the special but declined, citing his retirement from the franchise in August 2022. Archive audio of Frank is used in scenes where the Green Ranger appears. Frank passed away in November 2022, after the conclusion of principal photography but before the special was released on Netflix. The special is dedicated to his and Thuy Trang&#x27;s memories.

== Other versions ==
=== Comics ===

The character also appears in the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; comics from Boom Studios.

==== Lord Drakkon ====
A villainous alternate version of Tommy from another universe known as Lord Drakkon is also featured, with his costume combining elements of Tommy&#x27;s green and white Ranger suits. Drakkon also controls a unique Zord called the Black Dragon. Because of the chain of events including Lord Drakkon&#x27;s attacks to the Power Rangers&#x27; universe, it creates an alternate reality from the television series&#x27; continuity. He also kills Tommy before he can become the White Ranger. In 2018, Jason David Frank was involved with Boom! Studios&#x27; &quot;Power Rangers&quot; comic book storyline &quot;Shattered Grid&quot;, about the character&#x27;s war against all of the incarnations of the Power Rangers and their enemies throughout their universe&#x27;s timeline with Frank portraying Lord Drakkon in its promotions. During the storyline, despite Drakkon having killed Tommy as part of his first attack on the prime universe, Tommy nevertheless plays an important role in Lord Drakkon&#x27;s defeat, with a chain of events having trapped Tommy&#x27;s spirit in a crystal held in the weapon Drakkon used to kill his counterpart. When Drakkon succeeds in subverting the Morphing Grid and using it to rewrite the universe to make himself the hero, Tommy&#x27;s spirit forces Drakkon to face his fundamental weakness, Drakkon having attacked the multiverse simply because he couldn&#x27;t accept that he was the only Tommy Oliver to choose evil. Although Tommy offers his counterpart a truce, Drakkon chooses to die instead. After the multiverse is restored, the timeline returned to how it is supposed to be as depicted in the television franchise. However, Drakkon returns to threaten the prime universe, with the Omega Rangers- Jason, Trini and Zack using new powers- recruiting Drakkon for his expertise out of desperation to deal with the greater threat.

==== Soul of the Dragon ====
Tommy features in the graphic novel &quot;Soul of the Dragon&quot;, which depicts him as an old man investigating the recent disappearance of his son, J.J., who has apparently dropped out of SPD. While investigating his son&#x27;s recent activities with the aid of another SPD cadet, Tommy learns that his Master Morpher was damaged the last time he used it eight years ago; as a result, he can only morph into his past Ranger identities in reverse order (Black Dino to original Green), and once he has used a morph the power coin that creates the morph will be destroyed. With the aid of a reformed Finster, Tommy learns that J.J. was actually undercover investigating the return of Scorpina and the dark wizard Lokar, culminating in Tommy giving his Master Morpher to his son so that J.J. can use the final morph for himself. When Scorpina was defeated, Lokar got tired of waiting as Tommy witnesses Lokar sucking Scorpina and some of his followers back into the Talos Dimension. As Tommy leaves for a vacation with Kat, it is revealed that J.J. has become the official SPD Green Ranger, but the dregs of power in the Master Morpher have also left him with his father&#x27;s Dragon Shield.

=== Films ===
==== 1995 film ====
In &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;, Jason David Frank portrayed a similar version of his character from the television series, who endowed new power from warrior Dulcea and becomes the White Ninja Ranger; he harnesses the spirit of the falcon and controlling the White Falcon Ninjazord to defeat Ivan Ooze with his team. Unlike the television series, Tommy&#x27;s White Ranger costume is more of an armor than a formfitting spandex.

==== &quot;Power/Rangers&quot; (2015 short film) ====
In &quot;Power/Rangers&quot; Tommy Oliver (played by Russ Bain), in this much darker reimagining, in this timeline the Machine Empire defeats the Power Rangers and destroys the Megazord in battle, Earth&#x27;s governments negotiate a truce with the Machine Empire and the Power Rangers are disbanded. Tommy is a wanted fugitive, whilst trying to find out who is murdering his former teammates. He fights Rocky DeSantos, who defected to the Machine Empire. After DeSantos is killed by Kimberly Hart, Tommy knows it isn&#x27;t Kimberly because she was killed during the final battle, revealing herself to be Rita in disguise and also the one who has been killing his teammates. She asks Tommy to rejoin her so they can rule the world together; Tommy refuses and attacks her.

==== &quot;Power Rangers&quot; (2017 film) ====
While Tommy Oliver did not appear in the 2017 reboot film, Jason David Frank does have a cameo role, and Tommy Oliver is referenced in a post-credits scene, setting up his role as the Green Ranger in future sequels. Frank&#x27;s cameo consists of a brief appearance of him as a random citizen of Angel Grove, accompanied by Amy Jo Johnson, where he is part of a crowd gathering after the Rangers have defeated Goldar in the Megazord, and is apparently the first person to bring out his cellphone to take a picture of the Megazord. The mid-credits sequence features a teacher in charge of the weekend detention class calling for Tommy Oliver, and the camera focusing on an empty chair with a green jacket with a dragon, draped over it. The cast of the film as well as Frank himself, have expressed interest in a female version in the sequel.

==== &quot;Power Rangers: Legacy Wars - Street Fighter Showdown&quot; (2018 shortfilm) ====
In this short film, Tommy Oliver is again played by Jason David Frank. He and former Megaforce ranger Gia Moran assist Ryu and Chun-Li in stopping the criminal M. Bison and freeing a captured Ninjor. During this film, it is revealed that Ninjor, who created the original power coins, gave Tommy an upgrade to his suit. He now has a silver and gold helmet, as well as new weapons and a darker colored suit.

== Reception ==
Tommy has been often voted as the most popular character of the entire franchise. The character was only intended to appear for one season but became so popular that Tommy became a breakout character and a season regular. In-universe, Tommy has gained a reputation as Earth&#x27;s greatest Power Ranger.

<doc id="434866" wikidata="Q372591" url="?curid=434866" title="Nguyễn Cao Kỳ">
<text>Nguyễn Cao Kỳ (; 8 September 1930 – 23 July 2011) was a South Vietnamese military officer and politician who served as the chief of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force in the 1960s, before leading the nation as the prime minister of South Vietnam in a military junta from 1965 to 1967. Then, until his retirement from politics in 1971, he served as vice president to bitter rival General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, in a nominally civilian administration.

Born in Northern Vietnam, Kỳ joined the Vietnamese National Army of the French-backed State of Vietnam and started as an infantry officer before the French sent him off for pilot training. After the French withdrew from Vietnam and the nation was partitioned, Kỳ moved up the ranks of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force to become its leader. In November 1963, Kỳ participated in the coup that deposed president Ngô Đình Diệm and resulted in Diệm&#x27;s assassination.

In 1964, Kỳ became prominent in junta politics, and was part of a group of young, aggressive officers dubbed the &quot;Young Turks&quot;. Over the next two years, there were numerous successful and failed coup attempts. In September 1964, he helped put down a coup attempt by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức against Nguyễn Khánh, and the following February he thwarted another attempt by Phát and Phạm Ngọc Thảo. His favored tactic was to send fighter jets into the air and threaten large-scale air strikes to force his opponents to back down. After the latter attempt, he also forced the Khánh into exile and became the leading member of the junta in mid-1965 by becoming prime minister, while General Thiệu was a figurehead chief of state. He gained notoriety for his flamboyant manner, womanizing, and risky and brash behavior, which deeply concerned South Vietnam&#x27;s American allies and angered the Vietnamese public, many of whom regarded him as a &quot;cowboy&quot; and &quot;hooligan&quot;. He cared little for public relations, and publicly made numerous controversial statements and threats.

Nevertheless, Kỳ and Thiệu were able to end the cycle of coups, and the Americans backed their regime. In 1966 Kỳ decided to purge rival General Nguyễn Chánh Thi from a command role, which provoked major unrest in Da Nang and Huế. He publicly threatened to kill the mayor of Đà Nẵng. Three months of large-scale demonstrations and riots paralyzed parts of the country, and after much maneuvering and some military battles, Kỳ&#x27;s forces finally put down the uprising, and Thi was exiled, entrenching the former&#x27;s grip on power.

In 1967, a transition to an elected government was scheduled, and after a power struggle within the military, Thiệu ran for the presidency with Kỳ as his running mate. To allow the two to work together, their fellow officers had agreed to have a military body controlled by Kỳ shape policy behind the scenes. The election was rigged to ensure that Thiệu and Kỳ&#x27;s military ticket would win, and strong executive powers meant that the junta, in effect, still ruled. Leadership tensions persisted, and Thiệu prevailed, sidelining Kỳ supporters from key positions. Thiệu then enacted legislation to restrict candidacy eligibility for the 1971 election, banning almost all would-be opponents; Kỳ and the rest withdrew as they expected the election to be fraudulent; Thiệu went on to win the election uncontested, while Kỳ retired. With the fall of Saigon, Kỳ fled to the United States. He continued to heavily criticize both the communists and Thiệu, and the former prevented him from returning. However, in 2004, he became the first South Vietnamese leader to return to Vietnam, calling for reconciliation between communists and anti-communists.

== Early years and rising up the ranks ==
A northerner, Kỳ was born in Sơn Tây, a town west of Hanoi. After completing his secondary schooling in Chu Văn An High School, Hanoi, he enlisted in the French-backed Vietnamese National Army of the State of Vietnam in 1951 and was commissioned in the infantry after attending an officers training school. After a brief period in the field against the communist Việt Minh of Hồ Chí Minh during the First Indochina War, the French military hierarchy sent Kỳ, then a lieutenant, to Marrakech in Morocco to train as a pilot. Kỳ gained his wings on 15 September 1954. The French defeat at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ and the Geneva Conference ended the colonial presence in Indochina, and Kỳ came back to the new Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). The commander of a transport squadron, Kỳ was put in charge of Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base, the main aerial facility in the capital, Saigon. Kỳ then went to the United States to study for six months at the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Field, Alabama, where he learned to speak English. He returned to Vietnam and continued to rise up the ranks.

A soldier in the Vietnamese National Army who eventually became commander of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, prime minister and vice president of South Vietnam, Kỳ had little political experience or ambition initially. After flight training by the French, he returned to Vietnam in 1954 and held a series of commands in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. Under the regime of Dương Văn Minh, whose coup Kỳ had supported, he was made an air marshal, replacing Colonel Đỗ Khắc Mai as head of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force.

Kỳ began his association with the American covert operations community in 1961. While still ranked as a major commanding Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base, he became the first pilot for South Vietnam&#x27;s presidential liaison officer, which was organizing to infiltrate military intelligence teams into North Vietnam. He recruited pilots from his command for this intelligence program of the Central Intelligence Agency, and flew some of the missions himself after being trained by an expert pilot from Air America. At one point, Kỳ took the CIA&#x27;s Saigon station chief, William Colby, for a demonstration low-level flight. Kỳ&#x27;s flight training graduation gift for himself and his pilots was a flight to Singapore, where he purchased black flight suits, silk scarfs, and cigarette lighters for all hands. Colby was amused by his flight but unhappy with the selection of flashy attire.

== Rise to prominence in the junta ==

In January 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh deposed Minh, and it was under Khánh&#x27;s one-year rule that Kỳ rose to become one of the leading powers in the junta. Having been demoted, disgruntled Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức launched a coup attempt against Khánh before dawn on 13 September, using ten army battalions that they had recruited. Their faction consisted mainly of Catholic elements. They took over the city without any firing, and used the national radio station to proclaim the deposal of Khánh&#x27;s junta. There was little reaction from most of the military commanders. Kỳ had two weeks earlier promised to use his planes against any coup attempt, but there was no reaction to begin with.

Some time after the plotters had made their broadcast, Kỳ consolidated the troops on Saigon&#x27;s outskirts at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base, the largest in the country and where the military was headquartered. He barricaded the soldiers into defensive positions and vowed a &quot;massacre&quot; if the rebels attacked the base. A stand-off of tanks and troops around the perimeter of the base occurred, but it petered away without any violence as the rebels were withdrawn. Kỳ had apparently been angered by comments made by a rebel source who claimed that he was part of the coup attempt. At the same time, Kỳ was known for his hawkish attitude and close relations with the US military establishment in Vietnam, and American opposition to the coup was thought to have been conveyed to him efficiently. Đức mistakenly thought that Kỳ and his subordinates would be joining the coup, but was wrong.

The announcement of US support for the incumbent helped to deter ARVN officers from joining Lâm and Đức. Khánh returned to Saigon and put down the putsch, aided mainly by Kỳ and the Air Force. Kỳ decided to make a show of force as Phát and Đức began to wilt, and he sent jets to fly low over Saigon and finish off the rebel stand. He also sent two C-47s to Vũng Tàu to pick up two companies of South Vietnamese marines who remained loyal to Khánh. Several more battalions of loyal infantry were transported into Saigon. Kỳ&#x27;s political star began to rise.

As the coup collapsed, Kỳ and Đức appeared with other senior officers at a news conference where they proclaimed that the South Vietnamese military was united, and announced a resolution by the armed forces, signed by them and seven other leading commanders, claiming a united front against corruption. The officers contended that the events in the capital were misinterpreted by observers, as &quot;there was no coup.&quot; Kỳ claimed that Khánh was in complete control and that the senior officers involved in the standoff &quot;have agreed to rejoin their units to fight the Communists&quot;, and that no further action would be taken against those who were involved with Đức and Phát&#x27;s activities, but Khánh arrested them two days later.

Kỳ and Thi&#x27;s role in putting down the attempted coup gave them more leverage in Saigon&#x27;s military politics. Indebted to Kỳ, Thi, and the Young Turks for maintaining his hold on power, Khánh was now weaker. Kỳ&#x27;s group called on Khánh to remove &quot;corrupt, dishonest, and counterrevolutionary&quot; officers, civil servants, and exploitationists, and threatened to remove him if he did not enact their proposed reforms. Some observers accused Kỳ and Thi of deliberately orchestrating or allowing the plot to develop before putting it down in order to embarrass Khánh and allow himself to gain prominence on the political stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuần, a professor and Buddhist activist based in the northern town of Đà Nẵng, claimed that during a meeting with Kỳ and Thi a few days before the coup, the officers had discussed their plans for joining a coup against Khánh.

=== December 1964 South Vietnamese coup ===

Kỳ was part of a group of younger officers called the Young Turks. The most prominent members, apart from himself, included IV Corps commander General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, commander of I Corps Thi and Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, the head of the Republic of Vietnam Navy. They, and Khánh, wanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service as they thought them to be lethargic, out of touch, and ineffective. The unspoken and most important reason, however, was that they viewed the older generals as rivals for power and wanted to conceal this real motive. Specific targets of this proposed policy were Generals Minh, Trần Văn Đôn, Lê Văn Kim and Mai Hữu Xuân.

The signature of Chief of State Phan Khắc Sửu was required to pass the ruling, but he referred the matter to the High National Council (HNC), a junta-appointed civilian advisory body, to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. On 19 December, the generals dissolved the HNC and arrested some of the members as well as other civilian politicians, and the older generals, who were removed from the military. The actual arrests were made by a small force commanded by Thi and Kỳ. The deposal prompted US Ambassador Maxwell D. Taylor to angrily berate Thiệu, Thi, Kỳ, and Cang in a private meeting and threaten to cut off aid if they did not reverse their decision. Kỳ later admitted to being stung by Taylor&#x27;s comments. However, this galvanized the officers around the embattled Khánh for a time, and they ignored Taylor&#x27;s threats without repercussions as the Americans were too intent on defeating the communists to cut funding.

In January 1965, the junta-appointed prime minister, Trần Văn Hương, introduced a series of measures to expand the anticommunist war effort, notably by widening the terms of conscription. This provoked widespread anti-Hương riots across the country, mainly from conscription-aged students and pro-negotiations Buddhists. Reliant on Buddhist support, Khánh did little to try to contain the protests. Khánh then decided to have the armed forces take over the government. On 27 January, Khánh removed Hương in a bloodless putsch with the support of Thi and Kỳ. He promised to leave politics once the situation was stabilized and hand over power to a civilian body. It was believed that some of the officers supported Khánh&#x27;s increased power so as to give him an opportunity to fail and thus be removed permanently.

By this time, Taylor&#x27;s relationship with Khánh had already broken down over the issue of the HNC, and the US became more intent on a regime change as Khánh was reliant on Buddhist support, which they saw as an obstacle to an expansion of the war. Knowing that he was close to being forced out, Khánh tried to start negotiations with the communists, but this only increased the plotting. In early February, Taylor told Kỳ, who then passed on the message to colleagues in the junta, that the United States was &quot;in no way propping up General Khanh or backing him in any fashion.&quot; Taylor thought his message had been effective.

=== 1965–67 ===
Between January and February 1965, Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, in reality a communist double agent, was locked in a power struggle with junta leader General Khánh, and began plotting a coup against Khánh, who he thought was trying to kill him. Thảo consulted Kỳ—who wanted to seize power for himself—before the plot, and exhorted him to join the coup, but the Air Force chief claimed he would remain neutral. Thảo thus had reason to believe that Kỳ would not intervene. Kỳ had been preparing his own coup plans for a fortnight and was strongly opposed to Thảo and Phát. Kỳ, Thiệu, Có and Cang were not yet ready to make a coup, and their preparations were well behind that of Thảo.

Shortly before noon on 19 February, Thảo and General Phát used around 50 tanks, and some infantry battalions, to seize control of the military headquarters, the post office, and the radio station of Saigon. He surrounded the home of Khánh and Gia Long Palace, the residence of head of state Phan Khắc Sửu. The ground troops also missed capturing Kỳ, who fled in a sports car with his wife and mother-in-law. Kỳ ended up at Tân Sơn Nhứt, where he ran into Khánh, and the pair flew off together, while some of their colleagues were arrested there.

Thảo made a radio announcement, stating that the sole objective of his military operation was to get rid of Khánh, whom he described as a &quot;dictator&quot;, while some of his fellow rebels made comments extolling Diệm and indicating they would start a hardline Catholic regime. Phát was supposed to seize the Biên Hòa Air Base to prevent Kỳ from mobilising air power against them. The attempt to seize Biên Hòa failed, as Kỳ got there first and took control, before circling Tân Sơn Nhứt, threatening to bomb the rebels.

A CIA report and analysis written after the coup concluded that &quot;Ky&#x27;s command of the air force made him instrumental&quot; in preventing Khánh from being overrun, &quot;until Ky changed his mind&quot; on Khánh&#x27;s continuing hold on power. Most of the forces of the III and IV Corps surrounding the capital disliked both Khánh and the rebels and took no action.

The Americans decided that while they wanted Khánh out, they did not approve of Thảo and Phát, so they began to lobby Kỳ and Thi, the two most powerful officers outside Khánh, to defeat both sides. They unofficially designated Kỳ the duty of moderating between the coup forces and Khánh&#x27;s loyalists, preventing bloodshed and keeping them apart until some further action was planned. Kỳ&#x27;s work slowed the advance of several Khánh-loyalist units into the capital. During all of these moves, Kỳ&#x27;s hand was strengthened by the mistaken belief of Khánh and his faction that the Air Force commander supported them.

At 8 p.m., Phát and Thảo met Kỳ in a meeting organised by the Americans, and insisted that Khánh be removed from power. The coup collapsed when, around midnight, loyal ARVN forces swept into the city from the south and some loyal to Kỳ from Biên Hòa in the north. Whether the rebels were defeated or a deal was struck with Kỳ to end the revolt in exchange for Khánh&#x27;s removal is disputed, but most analysts believe the latter. Before fleeing, Thảo managed a final radio broadcast, stating that the coup had been effective in removing Khánh. This was not the case yet, but later in the morning, Kỳ and Thi led the Armed Forces Council in adopting a vote of no confidence in Khánh, and they assumed control of the junta.

In May 1965, a military tribunal under Kỳ sentenced both Phát and Thảo, who had gone into hiding, to death &quot;in absentia&quot;. As a result, Thảo had little choice but to attempt to seize power from Kỳ in order to save himself. On 20 May, a half dozen officers and around 40 civilians, predominantly Catholic, were arrested on charges of attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Phan Huy Quát and kidnap Kỳ, among others. Several of the arrested were known supporters of Thảo and believed to be abetting him in evading the authorities. In July 1965, he was reported dead in unclear circumstances; an official report claimed that he died of injuries while on a helicopter &quot;en route&quot; to Saigon, after having been captured north of the city. However, it is generally assumed that he was hunted down and murdered or tortured to death on the orders of some officials in Kỳ&#x27;s junta. In his memoirs, Kỳ claimed Thảo was jailed and &quot;probably [died] from a beating.&quot;

On 19 June 1965 Kỳ was appointed prime minister by a special joint meeting of military leaders following the voluntary resignation of civilian president Phan Khắc Sửu and Prime Minister Phan Huy Quát, who had been installed by the military. South Vietnam&#x27;s system of government shifted to that of a strong prime minister, with Thiệu becoming a figurehead president. Kỳ ended the cycle of coups that plagued South Vietnam following the overthrow of Diệm. Kỳ and Thiệu&#x27;s military junta decided to inaugurate their rule by holding a &quot;no breathing week&quot;. They imposed censorship, closed many newspapers that published material deemed unacceptable, and suspended civil liberties. They then sidelined the civilian politicians to a &quot;village of old trees&quot; to &quot;conduct seminars and draw up plans and programs in support of government policy&quot;. They decided to ignore religious and other opposition groups &quot;with the stipulation that troublemakers will be shot.&quot;
The generals began to mobilize the populace into paramilitary organizations. After one month, Quang began to call for the removal of Thiệu because he was a member of Diệm&#x27;s Catholic Cần Lao party, decrying Thiệu &quot;fascistic tendencies&quot;, and claiming Cần Lao members were undermining Kỳ.

In February 1966, Kỳ attended the Honolulu summit where his talks with President Johnson persuaded him that he now assert his authority as he believed he had the backing of the United States. After the overthrow of Khánh, South Vietnam had devolved into an alliance of warlords, becoming almost a feudal state with each corps commander ruling his area as a warlord, keeping most of the tax money for themselves and sending the rest to the government in Saigon. Knowing that the United States wanted political stability in South Vietnam, initially Kỳ was willing to accept this arrangement, but after hearing Johnson&#x27;s praise him as a strong leader at the Honolulu summit, he became convinced that the United States would back him if he asserted his authority against the corps commanders-cum-warlords. In particular, Kỳ wanted to bring down General Thi, who ruled central South Vietnam as his own fiefdom.

According to Alfred W. McCoy, Kỳ was the head of one of the three major South Vietnamese narcotics rings during this period, which also involved his sister and loyal military officers. McCoy States that this organization used the South Vietnamese Air Force to smuggle opium from Laos for Saigon&#x27;s opium-smoking dens through South Vietnamese Customs. McCoy states that Kỳ&#x27;s organization also controlled the Saigon port authority and taxed Corsican opium exports to Europe and Chinese opium and morphine shipments to Hong Kong.

=== Power struggle with Thi and Buddhist Uprising ===

Kỳ&#x27;s greatest struggle came in 1966, when he dismissed General Thi, resulting in a Buddhist Uprising and military revolt in Thi&#x27;s I Corps. Within the junta, Thi was seen as Kỳ&#x27;s main competitor for influence. Many political observers in Saigon thought that Thi wanted to depose Kỳ, and regarded him as the biggest threat to the other officers and the junta&#x27;s stability. According to Kỳ&#x27;s memoirs, Thi was a &quot;born intriguer&quot; who had &quot;left-wing inclinations&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a piece in February 1966 that claimed that Thi was more dynamic than Kỳ and could seize power at any time. Historian Robert Topmiller claimed Kỳ may have seen the article as destabilizing and therefore decided to move against Thi.

Historian Stanley Karnow said of Kỳ and Thi: &quot;Both flamboyant characters who wore gaudy uniforms and sported sinister moustaches, the two young officers had been friends, and their rivalry seemed to typify the personal struggles for power that chronically afflicted South Vietnam. But their dispute mirrored more than individual ambition.&quot; Both were known for the colorful red berets they wore. There were reports that Thi was showing insubordination towards Kỳ. The US military commander in Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, said that Thi once refused to report to Kỳ in Saigon when requested. On one occasion, Kỳ came to I Corps to remonstrate with him in early March, Thi addressed his staff and asked mockingly, &quot;Should we pay attention to this funny little man from Saigon or should we ignore him?&quot; Thi made this comment rather loudly, within earshot of Kỳ, and the Vietnamese politician Bùi Diễm thought that the prime minister viewed Thi&#x27;s comment as a direct challenge to his authority.

A native of central Vietnam, Thi was the commander of I Corps, which oversaw the five northernmost provinces of South Vietnam and the 1st and 2nd Divisions. He was known to have the &quot;deep rooted&quot; loyalty of his soldiers. A large segment of the South Vietnamese military was the Regional and Popular Forces, which were militias who served in their native areas, and they appreciated a commander with a regionalistic rapport. The support from the Buddhists, his troops, and the regional tendencies gave Thi a strong power base and made it hard for the other generals and the Americans to move against him.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that Thi &quot;ran it [I Corps] like a warlord of yore, obeying those edicts of the central government that suited him and blithely disregarding the rest.&quot; Historian George McTurnan Kahin said that Kỳ may have feared that Thi would secede from Saigon and turn central Vietnam into an independent state. CIA analyst Douglas Pike, who worked in Vietnam, speculated that this would have been a large part of Ky&#x27;s thinking. A combination of those factors resulted in Thi&#x27;s dismissal. Kỳ mustered the support of eight of the generals on the 10-man junta, meaning that along with his vote, there were nine officers in favor of Thi&#x27;s removal. With Thi the only nonsupporter, Kỳ and his colleagues removed Thi from the junta and his corps command on 10 March 1966. Kỳ threatened to resign if the decision was not unanimous, claiming that the junta needed a show of strength, so Thi decided to vote for his own sacking. The junta put Thi under house arrest pending his departure from the country, and then appointed General Nguyễn Văn Chuẩn, the erstwhile commander of 1st Division and a Thi subordinate, as the new I Corps commander.

Kỳ initially stated that Thi was leaving the country to receive medical treatment for his nasal passages. An official announcement said that the junta &quot;had considered and accepted General Thi&#x27;s application for a vacation&quot;. Thi retorted that &quot;The only sinus condition I have is from the stink of corruption.&quot; Kỳ then gave a series of reasons for dismissing Thi, accusing him of being too left-wing, of ruling the central regions like a warlord, of having a mistress who was suspected of being a communist, and being too conspiratorial. Despite Thi&#x27;s good relations with the Buddhists in his area, most notably Thích Trí Quang, Kỳ reportedly had the monks&#x27; support for Thi&#x27;s removal. Quang used the crisis to highlight Buddhist calls for civilian rule. There were claims that Quang intended to challenge Kỳ, regardless of whether or not Thi had been cast aside.

The Americans were supportive of Kỳ and his prosecution of the war against the communists, and they opposed Thi, regarding him as not being firm enough against communism. Thi did, however, have the support of Marine Lieutenant General Lewis Walt, who commanded American forces in I Corps and was the senior adviser to Thi&#x27;s ARVN forces. This caused problems during the dispute. The dismissal caused widespread demonstrations in the northern provinces. Civil unrest grew, as civil servants, disaffected military personnel, and the working under-class joined the anti-government demonstrations led by the Buddhists. At first, Kỳ tried to ignore the demonstrations and wait for them to peter out, but the problem escalated and riots broke out in some places. Despite continued American support, senior American foreign policy officials regarded Kỳ, General Thiệu and their regime as of very poor quality. Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy stated that the regime &quot;seemed to all of us the bottom of the barrel, absolutely the bottom of the barrel.&quot;

Kỳ gambled by allowing Thi to return to I Corps, ostensibly to restore order. He claimed he allowed Thi to return to his old area of command as a goodwill gesture, to keep central Vietnamese happy, and because he promised Thi a farewell visit before going into exile. Thi received a rousing reception and the anti-Kỳ protesters became more fervent. Kỳ then sacked the police chief of Huế, a Thi loyalist. The local policemen responded by going on strike and demonstrating against their chief&#x27;s removal.

Buddhists and other antijunta civilian activists joined with I Corps units supportive of Thi to form the Struggle Movement, leading to civil unrest and a halt in I Corps military operations. On 3 April, Kỳ held a press conference during which he claimed that Đà Nẵng was under communist control and vowed to stage a military operation to regain the territory, thus implying the Buddhists were communist agents. He vowed to kill the mayor of Đà Nẵng, saying &quot;Either Da Nang&#x27;s mayor is shot or the government will fall.&quot; The following evening, Kỳ deployed three battalions of marines to Đà Nẵng. The marines stayed at Đà Nẵng Air Base and made no moves against the rebels. Soon after, they were joined by two battalions of Vietnamese Rangers, as well as some riot police and paratroopers. Kỳ took personal command and found that the roads leading into the city had been blocked by Buddhist civilians and pro-Thi portions of the I Corps. After a standoff, Kỳ realized that he could not score a decisive victory and had lost face. He arranged a meeting and media event with Thi loyalist officers, and various Struggle Movement supporters.

Kỳ arrived back in Saigon, where he met with Buddhist leaders for negotiations. The Buddhists demanded an amnesty for rioters and mutinous soldiers, and for Kỳ to withdraw the marines from Đà Nẵng back to Saigon. The monks said they would order the Struggle Movement &quot;temporarily suspend all forms of struggle to prove our goodwill&quot;. After a period of tension and further tensions, Kỳ&#x27;s forces gained the upper hand in May, pressuring most Struggle Movement members to give up and militarily defeating the rest. He then put Quang under house arrest and finally had Thi exiled, cementing his junta&#x27;s grip on power and ending the Buddhist movement as a political force.

During his rule, Kỳ made many foreign state visits to bolster South Vietnam&#x27;s legitimacy. One visit to Australia in 1967 was somewhat controversial. Over time, Australian attitudes toward South Vietnam became increasingly negative, despite a contribution of ground troops to assist the fight against the communists; the bipartisanship of the 1950s evaporated. The centre-left Australian Labor Party became more sympathetic to the communists and their leader, Arthur Calwell, stridently denounced Kỳ as a &quot;fascist dictator&quot; and a &quot;butcher&quot; ahead of his 1967 visit. Despite the controversy leading up to the visit, Kỳ&#x27;s trip was a success. He dealt with the media effectively, despite hostile sentiment from some sections of the press and public.

During the trip to Australia, a power struggle with General Nguyễn Hữu Có, the deputy prime minister and defense minister, climaxed. Kỳ saw Có as a political threat and a magnet for dissidents, while Có deemed Kỳ to be &quot;immature&quot;. At the same time as his visit to Australia, Kỳ sent Có to Taiwan, ostensibly to represent the junta at a ceremonial event. With Có out of the country and unable to stage a coup, and Kỳ not within striking distance in case anyone wanted to capture him, news of Có&#x27;s removal was broken in Saigon. Có expressed a desire to return to Saigon, but was threatened with arrest and trial, and soldiers were deployed to the airport. Có was allowed to return in 1970 after Kỳ&#x27;s power had waned.

==Views==
Kỳ did not value democracy and believed that authoritarianism was necessary for South Vietnam to survive, a view shared with many of his fellow generals. In 1965, Kỳ told the journalist Brian Moynahan: &quot;People ask me who my heroes are. I have only one: Hitler&quot;. Kỳ&#x27;s comment that Hitler was his hero caused much controversy; although Kỳ had meant that his admiration was based on a view that Hitler had swiftly rebuilt Germany from a defeated state, something Kỳ also desired for South Vietnam, it nonetheless instantly damaged his international image. In an attempt at damage control, the administration of President Johnson denied to the American media that Kỳ had made the remark, claiming it was a fabrication by Moynahan, only to have the air marshal defiantly repeat the statement that Hitler was his only hero. Regarding the upcoming 1967 elections, Kỳ said that if the person elected is &quot;a Communist or a Neutralist, I am going to fight him militarily. In any democratic country you have the right to disagree with the views of others.&quot;

In a 1965 interview with American journalist James Reston, Reston summarised that Kỳ believed that the Communists were &quot;closer to the people&#x27;s yearning for social justice and an independent life&quot; than his own government was.

== 1967 elections ==

In the presidential election that was held in 1967, the military junta, which Kỳ chaired, intended to endorse only one candidate for the presidency. Kỳ intended to run, but at the last minute changed his mind and backed Thiệu, a move he later called &quot;the biggest mistake of my life.&quot; Thiệu nominated Kỳ as his running mate and the two were elected with 35 percent of the vote in a rigged poll. US policymakers heard rumors that the generals had agreed to subvert the constitution, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed the formation of a secret military committee that would control the government after the election. What had happened was that in the negotiations within the military, Kỳ had agreed to stand aside in exchange for behind-the-scenes power through a military committee that would shape policy and control the civilian arm of the government. Kỳ flatly denied these reports to Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, and the US Embassy notified Washington that &quot;The New York Times&quot; story was baseless. However, the story was later vindicated, as intelligence sources obtained the charter that told of the functions of the secret Supreme Military Committee (SMC). Walt Rostow briefed President Johnson and concluded that the SMC was &quot;in effect, a scheme for &#x27;guided democracy&#x27; in which a half dozen generals would decide finally what was good and bad for the country.&quot;
The campaign was overshadowed by US media criticism of Kỳ and Thiệu&#x27;s unfair electoral practices and sneaky tricks. All the candidates were scheduled to attend a rally at Quảng Trị in the far north of the country on 6 August. Owing to the security situation and the possibility of communist attacks, the politicians were transported to joint campaign events by the military, rather than being free to go to separate events as their strategy dictated. However, the Quảng Trị event had to be canceled after the candidates&#x27; plane landed 23 km away at an air base in Đông Hà. Believing that the mishap was a deliberate attempt to make them look chaotic and disorganized—Thiệu and Kỳ had decided not to attend rallies—the candidates boycotted the event and flew back to Saigon. There they denounced the government bitterly. The leading opposition candidate, Trần Văn Hương, claimed that Thiệu and Kỳ &quot;purposefully arranged the trip to humiliate us and make clowns out of us.&quot; As air force chief, Kỳ had previously stranded opposition politicians on a trip to the Central Highlands. Kỳ and Thiệu maintained that no malice was involved, but their opponents did not believe it. None of the candidates made good on their threat to withdraw, but their strident attacks over the alleged dirty tricks dominated the media coverage of the election for a period.

The adverse publicity embarrassed Washington; instead of hearing reports about progress and good governance in South Vietnam, most reports focused on corruption and fraud. The heavy and negative coverage of the election provoked angry debate in the US Congress, criticising Kỳ&#x27;s junta and Johnson&#x27;s policies. Such sentiment came from both houses and political parties. On 10 August 57 members of the United States House of Representatives signed a statement condemning Kỳ&#x27;s electoral malpractices and threatening a review of US policy in Vietnam.

Kỳ and Thiệu were reluctant to campaign and meet the populace as they saw such events as liabilities rather than opportunities to win over the public, and showed little interest in gaining popular support in any case, as they could always count on a rigging of the ballot. The CIA reported that the pair had no intention of participating on the arranged rallies with the civilian candidates because they felt that &quot;possible heckling from the audience that would be too humiliating.&quot; Thiệu and Kỳ were correct; they made one public campaign appearance at a rally, where a very disapproving crowd in Huế assailed Kỳ as a &quot;hooligan&quot; and &quot;cowboy leader&quot;. Kỳ and Thiệu decided to campaign indirectly by appearing at set piece ceremonial appointments, such as transferring land titles to peasants, as hostile elements from the general population were less likely to be present. Thiệu took a restrained and more moderate stance during the campaign toward the issue of democracy, while Kỳ, the public face of the ticket and the incumbent government, went on the attack, damaging the pair&#x27;s image and supposed commitment to democracy. Kỳ did not hide his distaste for democracy or his opponents and &quot;described the civilian candidates as &#x27;ordure&#x27; [dirt, filth, excrement], &#x27;traitors,&#x27; and &#x27;destroyers of the national interest.&#x27;&quot; He continued on to say that if his opponents continued to attack him, he would cancel the poll. In the accompanying senate election, Kỳ openly endorsed 11 slates, but only one was successful in gaining one of the six seats.

=== 1967–71: vice president ===
He served as vice president to Thiệu, although behind the scenes there was a fierce rivalry that left Kỳ marginalized. In the aftermath of the Tết Offensive, Thiệu enforced martial law and used the situation to consolidate his personal power. Kỳ&#x27;s supporters in the military and the administration were quickly removed from power, arrested, or exiled, ending any hopes of Kỳ exerting any power through the SMC or elsewhere. Alienated from Thiệu, Kỳ intended to oppose him in the 1971 elections, but Thiệu introduced laws to stop most of his rivals from running. Realizing that the poll would be rigged, Kỳ withdrew from politics. Thiệu ran unopposed and took 94 percent of the vote.

== Life in exile ==
After the defeat of South Vietnam by North Vietnam, on the last day of the fall of Saigon, 30 April 1975, Kỳ left Vietnam aboard the and fled to the United States and settled in Westminster, California, where he ran a liquor store. Kỳ wrote two autobiographies, &quot;How We Lost the Vietnam War&quot; and &quot;Buddha&#x27;s Child: My Fight to Save Vietnam&quot;.

Historian James McAllister openly questioned Kỳ&#x27;s honesty, saying that &quot;Buddha&#x27;s Child&quot;, as Kỳ called himself, &quot;is filled with unverifiable conversations and arguments that do not at all correspond with the historical record. Like his earlier memoir, it is often a self-serving attempt to continue his ongoing feud with the late president Nguyễn Văn Thiệu.&quot; He said &quot;with everything Ky writes about Vietnam . . . skepticism is in order.&quot;

Kỳ made headlines in 2004 by being the first South Vietnamese leader to return to Vietnam after the reunification, a move that was seen as a shameful one by many anticommunist groups in the Vietnamese American community. Kỳ had previously been critical of the Vietnamese government while in exile and had been denied a visa on several occasions. Upon setting foot on Vietnam, Kỳ defended his actions by saying that the Vietnam War was &quot;instigated by foreigners, it was brothers killing each other under the arrangements by foreign countries.&quot;

He added, &quot;In another 100 years, the Vietnamese will look back at the war and feel shameful. We should not dwell on it as it will not do any good for Vietnam&#x27;s future. My main concern at the moment is Vietnam&#x27;s position on the world map.&quot; Kỳ said that he only wanted to help build up Vietnam and promote national harmony, and assailed critics of his return, saying that &quot;those who bear grudges only care about themselves.&quot;

Kỳ later returned to Vietnam permanently and campaigned for increased foreign investment. Kỳ was involved in organizing trips to Vietnam for potential US investors.

== Style ==
Kỳ was well known for his flamboyant, colorful conduct and dress during his younger days. His trademark fashion accessory before he faded from public view in the 1970s was a silk scarf, which he wore with his black flight suit. He often raised eyebrows when he was the military prime minister by arriving at events to meet civilians with his wife in matching black flight suits, boots, blue caps, and silk scarves. He rarely was seen without a cigarette. He was notorious for his love of gambling, women, and glamour, which made American officials wary of him. He was also obsessed with cock fighting, not only hosting such fights in his own house but even traveling to Viet Cong zones without an escort to find fights. One official called him an &quot;unguided missile&quot;. When he was a young pilot, Kỳ once landed a helicopter in the road in front of a girlfriend&#x27;s house in order to impress her, causing the locals to panic and earning the ire of his commander for misusing military equipment. On one occasion, Kỳ is said to have pulled a handgun on a journalist whose questions annoyed him. Many in the South Vietnamese public service, military, and some of the general public disliked his tempestuous and impetuous style and regarded him as a &quot;cowboy&quot;. and a &quot;hooligan&quot;. At his only public campaign appearance during the 1967 presidential election, the large crowd repeatedly heckled him loudly, calling him a &quot;cowboy leader&quot; and &quot;hooligan&quot; and as a result he did not make any more appearances at rallies.

Oriana Fallaci, who interviewed him in 1968, included him in &quot;The Egoists: Sixteen Surprising Interviews&quot;, as one of the few people who surprised and impressed her the most relative to their controversial public personas. In the interview, Kỳ decried the corruption and poverty of South Vietnam, lamented about the inability of the government and the United States to solve their problems, compared the Catholics to the Communists, and openly agreed with many of the social aims of Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Cong. When an astounded Fallaci asked if he considered himself on the wrong side, Ky said &quot;Well yeah... if my destiny had been different, I could have been on [Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s] side&quot;. American officials were outraged by the interview, but Fallaci would praise him in her book as &quot;the only possible leader in a country painfully poor in leaders. Yet he is. And you realize it, with astonishment, when you listen to him for more than ten minutes. The man is not stupid. He has something to say, and he says it without fear.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Kỳ met and married his first wife, a Frenchwoman, in the 1950s when he was training as a pilot in France. In the 1960s, he divorced her and married Đặng Tuyết Mai, an Air Viet Nam flight attendant, who was his spouse during his years in power. He later married for a third time. His daughter from his second marriage, Nguyễn Cao Kỳ Duyên, is well known in the overseas Vietnamese entertainment industry as a mistress of ceremonies and singer on the music variety show &quot;Paris By Night&quot;. Many Vietnamese Americans called for her sacking after her father returned to Vietnam.

== Death ==
Kỳ died on 23 July 2011, aged 80, at a hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he was receiving treatment for &quot;respiratory complications&quot;. He was married three times and survived by six children. His ashes are interred at the Buddhist Columbarium of Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.

<text>Gaultheria shallon is an evergreen shrub in the heather family (Ericaceae), native to western North America. In English, it is known as salal, shallon, or (mainly in Britain) gaultheria.

==Description==
&quot;Gaultheria shallon&quot; is tall, sprawling to erect. It is loosely to densely branched and often forms dense, nearly impenetrable thickets. The twigs are reddish-brown, with shredding bark. Twigs can live up to 16 years or more, but bear leaves only the first few years.

The leaves are alternate, evergreen, leathery, thick and egg shaped. They are shiny and dark green on the upper surface, and rough and lighter green on the lower. Each finely and sharply serrate leaf is long. Each leaf generally lives for 2 to 4 years before it is replaced.

The inflorescence of flowers consists of a bracteate raceme, one-sided, with 5–15 flowers at the ends of branches. Each flower is composed of a deeply five-parted, glandular-haired calyx and an urn-shaped pink to white, glandular to hairy, five-lobed petals (corolla), long.

The fruit is reddish to blue, rough-surfaced, covered in tiny hairs, nearly spherical and 6 to 10 mm in diameter. The fruits are &#x27;pseudoberries&#x27;, or capsules made up of a fleshy outer calyx, and each fruit contains an average of 126 brown, reticulate seeds approximately 0.1 mm in length. These berries are also edible.

== Etymology ==
Lewis and Clark reported the local Chinook Jargon name of the omnipresent evergreen shrub to be &quot;shallon&quot;, &quot;shelwel&quot;, or &quot;shellwell&quot;, but when Scottish naturalist David Douglas arrived at Fort George in April 1825 he noted that it was not called &quot;shallon&quot; but rather &quot;salal or sallal&quot;.

The genus &quot;Gaultheria&quot; was named by Pehr Kalm for his guide in Canada, fellow botanist Jean François Gaultier.

In the Squamish language, the fruits are called t’áḵa7 and the bush is called t’áḵa7áy̓. In the Saanich dialect, salal berries are called DAḴE In the Lushootseed language, the month of August is named pədt̕aqaʔ, literally &#x27;time of the salal.&#x27;

== Distribution ==
Salal is found in Southeast Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon and along much of the California coast. It grows as far north as Baranof Island, Alaska. Western poison oak is a common associate in the California Coast Ranges.

=== In Europe ===
The species was introduced to Britain in 1828 by David Douglas, who intended the plant to be used as an ornamental. It is believed to have been planted as cover for pheasants on shooting estates.

==Ecology==

=== Preferred sites ===
&quot;G. shallon&quot; grows in moist to dry, montane to lowland coastal conifer forests as well as forested peatland and swamps throughout the Pacific Northwest down to Southern California. It is a common coniferous forest understory species where shade is not heavy and may dominate large areas with its spreading rhizomes. Individual plants may live for hundreds of years, spreading from their rhizomes. The plant is sensitive to frost.

It is tolerant of salt spray and grows well on stabilized dunes, exposed slopes, and bluffs near the ocean, as well as in coastal brushfields and coastal shore pine and Sitka spruce forests. Salal tolerates moderate shade and does well in sun.

It grows in a variety of soils but prefers moist sandy or peaty soils, and commonly establishes on decaying wood and stumps or as an epiphyte in extremely humid areas.

Conifer regeneration is typically better on sites dominated by salal than on sites dominated by the western swordfern or vine maple, although it still competes with conifer seedlings for water, nutrients, and space. There are mixed reports on its impact on Douglas-fir regrowth; on some sites it may hinder it, but on others it may add nutrients to the soil and actually increase conifer regeneration.

=== Use by animals ===
The leaves are browsed by deer and elk, and it is an important winter food for those species. Browsing is heaviest when other low-growing species become covered in snow; in Western Washington salal leaves composed 30.4% of deer diet by volume in January, compared to only 0.5% in June. The leaves have relatively low nutritional value, and deer which feed exclusively on them have shown signs of malnutrition, cementing their status as a winter and emergency food for ungulates. Beavers and the white-footed vole are known to feed on salal leaves, as are domestic goats and sheep in some areas.

The band-tailed pigeon, wrentit, various species of grouse, and numerous songbirds consume the fruit, as do mammals such as the red squirrel, black bear, black-tailed deer, Townsend&#x27;s chipmunk, and the Douglas squirrel.

Salal flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds, bees, and flies, and are browsed by deer.

It provides important cover and hiding places for a variety of species, from large ungulates to small birds and mammals.

=== Fire ecology ===
Salal is adapted to a fire regime of infrequent fires, from intervals of 50 to 500+ years. Although aboveground portions of the plant may be consumed, rhizomes in the soil will survive and resprout after light to moderate fires. Severe fires on dry, shallow soil will penetrate into the roots and kill the plant.

=== Invasiveness ===
It readily colonizes heathland and acidic woodland habitats in southern England, often forming very tall and dense evergreen stands which smother other vegetation. Although heathland managers widely regard it as a problem weed on unmanaged heathland, it is readily browsed by cattle (especially in winter), so where traditional grazing management has been restored, the dense stands become broken up and the plant becomes a more scattered component of the heathland vegetation.

As an invasive species, salal is resistant to many herbicides because of its waxy foliage, although Garlon and Silvex can be effective when properly applied. Attempts at mechanical removal may break up rhizomes and stimulate new growth, thus increasing salal cover.

==Uses==
The dark blue berries and young leaves are edible and efficient appetite suppressants, both with a unique flavor. The berries were a significant food resource for some Native American tribes, who ate them fresh and dried them into cakes. They were also used as a sweetener, and the Haida used them to thicken salmon eggs. The leaves of the plant were also sometimes used to flavor fish soup.

More recently, the berries are used locally in jams, preserves, and pies. They are often combined with Oregon-grape because salal&#x27;s mild sweetness partially masks the former&#x27;s tartness.

Salal is widely cultivated as an ornamental both within and outside of its native range, useful for ground cover and landscaping.

In the Pacific Northwest, the harvesting of &quot;G. shallon&quot; is the heart of a large industry which supplies cut evergreens worldwide for use in floral arrangements. It is used in native plant gardens and sold as &quot;Lemon Leaf&quot;.

=== Medicinal properties ===
The species has been used for its medicinal properties by local natives for generations, although its medicinal uses are not widely known. The leaves have an astringent effect, making it an effective anti-inflammatory and anti-cramping herb. Leaves prepared in a tea or tincture are thought to decrease internal inflammation (such as bladder inflammation), stomach or duodenal ulcers, heartburn, indigestion, sinus inflammation, diarrhea, moderate fever, inflamed/irritated throat, and menstrual cramps. A poultice of the leaf can be used externally to ease discomfort from insect bites and stings.

<text>The Outlaws Motorcycle Club, incorporated as the American Outlaws Association or its acronym, A.O.A., is an international outlaw motorcycle club. Founded in McCook, Illinois in 1935, the Outlaws MC is the oldest outlaw biker club in the world. With 441 chapters located in 43 countries, and a membership of over 3,000, the club is also the third-largest in the world, behind the Hells Angels and the Bandidos. Outlaws members typically ride Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

The club is designated an organized crime syndicate by numerous law enforcement and international intelligence agencies, including the United States Department of Justice, the Criminal Intelligence Service Canada, and Europol.

== History ==
Originating as the McCook Outlaws MC, the club was founded by Electro-Motive Company employees at Matilda&#x27;s bar on Route 66 in the southwestern Chicago suburb of McCook, Illinois in 1935. John Davis was reportedly the founder of the club. Although inactive during World War II, the Outlaws reformed afterwards and attended the first major post-war motorcycle rally, held at Soldier Field in Chicago in May 1946. By 1950, the club had begun recruiting members from around the Chicago area and was renamed the Chicago Outlaws MC after relocating its headquarters to the South Side of the city. In 1964, the Outlaws merged with the Cult biker club from Voorheesville, New York, the Gypsy Outlaws of Milwaukee, and the Gypsy Raiders in Louisville, Kentucky, becoming the largest &quot;one percenter&quot; club east of the Mississippi River and the second-largest in the United States after the California-based Hells Angels. On January 1, 1965, the various aligned clubs incorporated as the American Outlaws Association. The Outlaws further expanded into Florida in July 1967 by &quot;patching over&quot; the Iron Cross club in West Palm Beach.

The club featured in a work of photojournalism called &quot;The Bikeriders&quot; published in 1967 by Danny Lyon, a collection of photographs and interviews documenting the lifestyle of members of the club in the 1960s. Lyon spent four years riding with the Outlaws&#x27; Chicago chapter beginning in 1963 and became a full-fledged member of the club in &quot;an attempt to record and glorify the life of the American bike rider&quot;. &quot;The Bikeriders&quot; preceded &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs&quot; by Hunter S. Thompson, who warned Lyon that he should &quot;get to hell out of that club unless it&#x27;s absolutely necessary for photo action.&quot;

During the early 1970s, a power struggle for control of the Outlaws developed between a faction of &quot;beer drinkers&quot; and a rival group of club members who preferred to smoke marijuana. John Davis, the reputed founder of the Outlaws, was killed by a &quot;pot smoker&quot; and Vietnam veteran during a shootout near Lake Shore Drive on the North Side of Chicago as a result of the feud.

The Outlaws&#x27; long-standing rivalry with the Hells Angels began when three Hells Angel bikers were executed by Outlaw members in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on April 27, 1974. The triple murder was carried out in retaliation for the earlier beating of an Outlaw by a Hells Angel, which took place in New York City on December 31, 1973. The Hells Angels declared war on the Outlaws during a club summit held in Cleveland later in 1974. The conflict resulted in hundreds of fatalities in each club in the following decades.

In 1977, the Outlaws became an international club when several chapters of the Satan&#x27;s Choice Motorcycle Club in Canada &quot;patched over&quot;. The club further expanded internationally, into France in 1993, Australia in 1994, and Norway in 1995. Additional chapters were subsequently established throughout Europe. In November 2006, the Outlaws became the first major outlaw motorcycle club to open a chapter in the Far East when a full charter was awarded to a club in Okinawa City.

== Insignia ==

The Outlaws&#x27; original insignia consisted of a head-on view of a motorcycle in a winged circle, which was hand-painted onto the back of members&#x27; jackets. In 1950, the club&#x27;s logo was changed; a small skull replaced the winged motorcycle, and Old English-style letters were adopted. This design was embroidered on a black shirt or hand-painted onto leather jackets. Influenced by the fictional Black Rebel Motorcycle Club depicted in the film &quot;The Wild One&quot;, the Outlaws added crossed pistons affixed to the original small skull in 1954, a design embroidered on a black western-style shirt with white piping. The skull and crossed pistons logo, known as &quot;Charlie&quot;, was redesigned in 1959, making it larger and with more detail. The club&#x27;s &quot;Charlie&quot; insignia is a registered trademark. In 1963, the Outlaws began wearing a diamond-shaped &quot;1%er&quot; patch, becoming the first club east of the Mississippi River to do so. The &quot;one percenter&quot; emblem was originally adopted by several California biker clubs beginning in 1960. After incorporating as the American Outlaws Association in 1965, the club added an additional A.O.A. patch to its &quot;colors&quot;, featuring an upstretched middle finger in a rounded triangle. The A.O.A. emblem was adopted as a parody of the A.M.A. logo. A patch listing a member&#x27;s rank within the organization is also worn by club officers. An &quot;S.S.&quot; patch featuring twin lightning bolts is allegedly awarded to members who have committed murder, attempted murder or a bombing on behalf of the club. A black-and-white color scheme is associated with the Outlaws, as is &quot;Totenkopf&quot; imagery, symbols such as a hand clenching a pistol, and paraphernalia featuring the phrases &quot;Support Black &amp; White&quot; and &quot;Support Your Local Outlaws&quot;, or &quot;SYLO&quot;.

In 1969, the club adopted the motto &quot;God forgives, Outlaws don&#x27;t&quot; (&quot;GFOD&quot;). The Outlaws&#x27; rivalry with the Hells Angels has given rise to other phrases used by Outlaws members; namely &quot;ADIOS&quot; (the Spanish word for &quot;goodbye&quot;, but in this case doubling as an acronym for &quot;Angels Die In Outlaw States&quot;), and &quot;All Hells Angels must die&quot;, or &quot;AHAMD&quot;. &quot;Snitches are a dying breed&quot; as well as the more generic &quot;Outlaws forever, forever Outlaws&quot; (&quot;OFFO&quot;) are other mottos used by the club. Patches featuring these various abbreviations are commonly worn by Outlaws members.

== Membership ==

To be eligible for Outlaws membership, applicants must be White men over the age of 21 and also be in possession of an American-made motorcycle of at least 750cc. Outlaws in the United States and Canada are essentially limited to riding Indian, Victory and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are most common in the club. Outside of North America, however, this rule has been relaxed, allowing members to ride motorcycles manufactured in any country, provided they are in the chopper style.

The following five criteria are considered when evaluating an aspiring Outlaws member:

# Owns and rides a Harley-Davidson
# Is competent in the mechanics of motorcycles
# Lives a lifestyle congruent with biker subculture and &quot;treats other righteous bikers as bros&quot;
# Is viewed by society as masculine in &quot;outlook, behavior, and sexual orientation&quot;
# Does not conform to &quot;worldly values&quot; but instead conforms to the lifestyle of the club

To be formally inducted into club, applicants have to be sponsored by a member, and they begin as an associate, or &quot;hangaround&quot;, in order to assist the chapter, before being made a prospective member, or &quot;prospect&quot;; if he is approved by the club, then a prospect is moved up to probationary, or &quot;probate&quot;, status, a position in which he is required to demonstrate his commitment to the club. A probate is identified by wearing a mandatory patch on a cut-off leather or denim vest reading: &quot;Probationary Outlaws&quot;. The probationary period typically lasts several months. The highest level of membership in the Outlaws is &quot;patched&quot; or &quot;patchwearing&quot; member, which is attained by a unanimous vote of each chapter. Upon becoming a full-fledged member, an Outlaw is permitted to wear a vest bearing the club&#x27;s insignia, known as &quot;colors&quot;, and to attend weekly &quot;church&quot; meetings. The patch on a member&#x27;s colors displaying the Outlaws emblem is surrounded by other patches denoting chapter and club membership information, which are called &quot;rockers&quot;. These rocker patches are purchased directly from the international president. Club rules dictate that the Outlaws&#x27; patches must be worn on leather or black denim (blue denim is banned) and that club regalia is not allowed to be worn by members&#x27; wives or girlfriends. Women affiliated with the club, known as &quot;old ladies&quot;, are, however, allowed to wear vests with patches reading: &quot;Property of the Outlaws&quot;. Outlaws are instructed to guard their colors with their lives, and it is forbidden for any item bearing the club&#x27;s logo to touch the floor.
Members are required to pay dues of $1,200 per year and to attend local, regional and national events. Obligatory chapter &quot;church&quot; meetings are held weekly, and club motorcycle trips and parties which may last several days, known as &quot;runs&quot;, are held throughout the year. National runs take place three or four times per year, regional runs occur between five and twenty times a year, and local runs typically occur weekly. Membership dues are divided between the chapter and the region and are used to finance activities such as memorials and group excursions. Outlaws members are usually assessed a fee if a fellow club member is in need of legal assistance. It is compulsory for all members other than chapter presidents to take turns providing 24-hour armed guard at Outlaws clubhouses. Indiscipline and rule breaches are punished with a $300 fine. Members are also instructed by the club to attend funerals of fellow Outlaws. Additionally, Outlaws members reportedly transfer their membership from chapter to chapter more frequently than members of other prominent motorcycle clubs. Regarding contact with non-club members, Outlaws are required to adhere to a &quot;strict no comment policy&quot;.

After a year of membership in the club, Outlaws are eligible to sport a tattoo of the club&#x27;s emblem as well as club slogans, such as &quot;God forgives, Outlaws don&#x27;t&quot;, or &quot;GFOD&quot;. After five years, club members may have replicas of their &quot;colors&quot; tattooed on their backs. Additional tattoos may reflect membership information. Allegedly, a member who has killed or attempted to kill for the Outlaws is permitted to wear &quot;lightening bolts&quot;, a tattoo featuring a Nazi-style &quot;SS&quot; &quot;doppelte Siegrune&quot; (double sig runes) symbol. Incarcerated Outlaws members are known as &quot;Lounge Lizards&quot;, of which the club maintains a list and collects money on behalf of. An Outlaw who has served a prison sentence is entitled to receive an &quot;LL&quot;, or &quot;Lounge Lizard&quot;, tattoo. Other tattoos common with club members include &quot;AHAMD&quot;, an acronym for &quot;All Hells Angels must die&quot;.

Members can leave the club in either &quot;bad standing&quot;, &quot;good standing&quot;, in retirement or when deceased. Retired Outlaws are permitted to wear a &quot;dress shirt (retirement style)&quot;, according to the club&#x27;s bylaws. Some club leaders, however, such as James &quot;Big Jim&quot; Nolan, have at times upheld a ban on members retiring from the Outlaws.

== Organization ==
Outlaws chapters are governed by an elected officer corps consisting of a president, vice president, treasurer, and sergeant-at-arms, or &quot;enforcer&quot;. Chapters follow guidelines that dictate election procedures, gatherings, and action against members who have violated the club&#x27;s bylaws. The club has 441 chapters located in 43 countries, in Asia, Europe and North America. Each chapter is headquartered at a clubhouse, which is typically a building secured by concrete walls, steel doors, razor wire, guard dogs, and video surveillance. Clubhouses are used to host &quot;church&quot; meetings and parties. Chapter presidents report to regional presidents, who oversee individual regions, which are divided and named by color, such as the red and blue regions. Regional president in turn report to the club&#x27;s international president, who heads the Outlaws organization. Officers at the national, regional and local levels are elected by the membership of the club. According to law enforcement, the Outlaws&#x27; internal enforcer squad is known as the &quot;S.S.&quot;.

The Outlaws&#x27; territory in the United States is divided into ten color-coded regions; the black region (Indiana and Michigan), the blue region (Pennsylvania), the copper region (North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia), the gold region (Wisconsin), the gray region (Tennessee), the green region (Kentucky, Ohio and Oklahoma), the orange region (Florida), the red region (New England and the Philadelphia metro area), the silver region (Alabama and Georgia), and the white region (Illinois). Formerly, the club&#x27;s territory was divided into three areas; &quot;Central&quot;, headquartered in Chicago; &quot;North&quot;, headquartered in Detroit; and &quot;South&quot;, headquartered in Oklahoma City. The Outlaws&#x27; international headquarters has historically been centred in the Midwest. The South Side, Chicago chapter was designated the club&#x27;s &quot;mother chapter&quot; in 1964 and is known as the &quot;Mother Ship&quot; among Outlaws members. During the presidency of Harry &quot;Taco&quot; Bowman, from 1984 until 1999, the Outlaws&#x27; leadership was based in Detroit. Bowman&#x27;s successor, James &quot;Big Frank&quot; Wheeler, relocated the club&#x27;s headquarters to Tampa, Florida. The subsequent Outlaws international president, Jack Rosga, was based in Milwaukee. In April 2021, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph M. Tripi alleged in court papers that the current international president of the Outlaws is John Ermin, the general manager of Pharaoh&#x27;s Gentlemen&#x27;s Club in Cheektowaga, New York.

=== Support clubs ===
Each major Outlaws chapter maintains one to five support clubs, smaller motorcycle clubs which are within the Outlaws&#x27; sphere of influence. Members of such clubs are permitted to attend Outlaws events and wear &quot;support&quot; patches which identify them with the Outlaws, and are required to perform menial tasks and guard duties on the Outlaws&#x27; behalf. According to law enforcement, the Outlaws utilize support clubs to carry out retail-level drug distribution and violent crimes in order to insulate the 
club from possible criminal liability. 

The official, and primary, support club for the Outlaws is the Black Pistons Motorcycle Club, which is active internationally. Other support clubs range from local groups, such as the Undertakers MC in Lexington, Kentucky, to regional clubs like the Chosen Few MC, which is based in Canada and Upstate New York. Although the Outlaws are a White-only club, the group&#x27;s support clubs include African American motorcycle clubs, such as the Outcast MC. In Norway, the Outlaws oversee the Black &amp; White Crew, a &quot;street crew&quot; in which members are not required to own a motorcycle.

== Criminal allegations and incidents ==
The Outlaws are classified by various law enforcement agencies in the United States as one of the &quot;big four&quot; motorcycle gangs, along with the Bandidos, the Hells Angels, and the Pagans. The Department of Justice contends that the club is involved in organized crime, including drug trafficking, extortion, money laundering, prostitution rings, weapons trafficking, and violent acts directed at rival clubs. One recurring allegation is that the Outlaws are responsible for the production and distribution of methamphetamine. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies internationally, including the Criminal Intelligence Service Canada and Europol, also consider the Outlaws a criminal organization.

Members have continuously denied that the Outlaws are an organized crime syndicate, asserted that the club is simply a group of motorcycle enthusiasts who live a nonconventional lifestyle, and described allegations by investigators and prosecutors as exaggerated. The Outlaws&#x27; website features a statement reading: &quot;The government has labeled the Outlaws MC a criminal organization and all members as criminals simply because they are members. This is one of the most untrue and unjust statements ever made concerning our club. Each and every day America and the World members of Law Enforcement, Religious, Fraternal organizations as well as many other groups are convicted of criminal activity. Their membership is not universally labeled as criminals&quot;. A saying used by members of the club is: &quot;Outlaws we are, RICO we&#x27;re not&quot;.

<text>William Ferrel (January 29, 1817 – September 18, 1891) was an American meteorologist who developed theories that explained the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation cell in detail, and it is after him that the Ferrel cell is named.

==Biography==
Ferrel was born in Fulton county in southern Pennsylvania. He was the eldest of eight children born to his father, Benjamin Ferrel, and his mother, whose first name is unknown. His mother was a farmer’s daughter, and his family owned a farm in the Allegheny Mountains on which he was raised. At age twelve, he was working on both the farm and the saw-mill on it. They moved to what would become West Virginia in 1829. His formal elementary schooling was limited and he only attended for two winters, but was inspired by science especially due to witnessing a partial solar eclipse in 1832. Using science books, which he went into Martinsburg and Hagerstown to purchase, he taught himself well enough to become a school teacher.

He saved his salary as a school teacher to attend Marshall College, but could only fund two years of his education. As such, he returned to teaching for two years in West Virginia, to afford the rest of his education at Bethany College. He was able to graduate from Bethany College&#x27;s first graduating class in 1844. He would continue teaching in Missouri and Tennessee until 1858. In Liberty, Missouri, he found a copy of Newton’s &quot;Principia&quot; which included some additional papers on the tide from the French Academy of Science, which he studied and theorised about. He also studied Laplace’s &quot;Mécanique Céleste,&quot; and these combined led him to believe that the motion of the Sun and moon on the tides was slowing the Earth’s rotation around its axis. This was the basis of his first paper, which went against Laplace’s theories, as Ferrel believed he had ignored second order terms.

In 1854, Ferrel set up a school in his new home, Nashville, Tennessee. In 1858, he took up a full-time position on the staff of American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1867, he moved to Washington, D.C., and joined the United States Coast Survey

In 1882, Ferrel joined the United States Army Signal Service (which was the United States Government agency responsible for weather forecasting until the creation of the United States Weather Bureau in 1891) and retired in 1886. He died in Maywood (Wyandotte county), a suburb of Kansas City, in 1891.

==Work==
Ferrel demonstrated that it is the tendency of rising warm air, as it rotates due to the Coriolis effect, to pull in air from more equatorial, warmer regions and transport it poleward. It is this rotation which creates the complex curvatures in the frontal systems separating the cooler Arctic/Antarctic air polewards from the warmer tropical air towards the equator.

Ferrel improved upon Hadley&#x27;s theory by recognizing an until then overlooked mechanism. This is a quote from his first paper:

 The fourth and last force arises from the combination of a relative east or west motion of the atmosphere with the rotatory motion of the earth. In consequence of the atmosphere&#x27;s revolving on a common axis with that of the earth, each particle is impressed with a centrifugal force, which, being resolved into a vertical and a horizontal force, the latter causes it to assume a spheroidal form conforming to the figure of the earth. But, if the rotatory motion of any part of the atmosphere is greater than that of the surface of the earth, or, in other words, if any part of the atmosphere has a relative eastern motion with regard to the earth&#x27;s surface, this force is increased, and if it has a relative western motion, it is diminished, and this difference gives rise to a disturbing force which prevents the atmosphere being in a state of equilibrium, with a figure conforming to that of the earth&#x27;s surface, but causes an accumulation of the atmosphere at certain latitudes and a depression at others, and the consequent difference in the pressure of the atmosphere at these latitudes very materially influences its motions.

Hadley&#x27;s erroneous reasoning had been in terms of a tendency to conserve linear momentum, as air mass travels from north to south or from south to north. Ferrel recognized that in meteorology and oceanography what needs to be taken into account is a tendency, of an air mass that is in motion relative to Earth, to conserve its angular momentum with respect to Earth&#x27;s Axis.

Ferrel also studied the effects that the Sun and Moon had on the tides, and how it affected Earth’s rotation about its axis. Laplace had theorised on this before, but he had neglected second order terms and fluid friction. This was through no fault of his own, as the mathematics that would allow him to study it didn’t exist until the 1840’s. It’s assumed that friction is proportional to the square of velocity, giving non-linear equations. Ferrel was the first person to treat these successfully. He also suggested that the tides could be explained by the Earth having a viscous interior, and attempted to study the magnetism of the Earth.

Ferrel collected data on the tides, and used this to calculate the mass of the moon. In 1880, he proposed to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey a machine which could use data to predict the tidal maxima and minima. He also presented this idea to the American Association for the Advancement of Science later in the same year. Ferrel resigned from the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1882, but stayed on to oversee the completion of this project, which was a big success and was used for over 25 years.

He also wrote &quot;Vision,&quot; an essay discussing his theories on how human sight works; his discussion was based in both mathematics and psychology, and backed up by experiments. Additionally, he wrote about &quot;Variable Stars,&quot; discussing how periods of fluctuation could indicate whether they are approaching/retreating the Earth.

<doc id="434889" wikidata="Q3927115" url="?curid=434889" title="String Quartets, Op. 18 (Beethoven)">
<text>Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 18, published in 1801 by T. Mollo et Comp in Vienna in two books of three quartets each, comprised his first six string quartets. They were composed between 1798 and 1800 to fulfill a commission for Prince Joseph Franz Maximilian Lobkowitz, who was the employer of Beethoven&#x27;s friend, the violinist Karl Amenda. They are thought to demonstrate his total mastery of the classical string quartet as developed by Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The order of publication (numbering within the opus) does not correspond to the order of composition. Beethoven composed these quartets in the sequence 3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6. See:

:* String Quartet No. 1 in F major
:* String Quartet No. 2 in G major
:* String Quartet No. 3 in D major
:* String Quartet No. 4 in C minor
:* String Quartet No. 5 in A major
:* String Quartet No. 6 in B major

In an April 1802 letter to Hofmeister in Leipzig, Beethoven says the Mollo edition of nos. 4-6 is error-ridden (&quot;has again, let us say, filled with faults and errata, great and small&quot;), and Kerman makes a similar comment, leaving one to conclude that the poor Mollo edition of nos. 4-6, which incited private protests from the composer, may also be the best existing primary source for those three works, unless manuscripts or sketches for them have been discovered. This applies to nos. 4-6; the situation for no. 1, especially, is different, since an entire earlier version has been preserved, published and even recorded. While the overall set is less critically acclaimed than the &quot;Razumovsky&quot; quartets and the late quartets, op. 18, no. 1 has been perennially admired. It is noted for its unity, with 131 iterations of the opening motive in its 427 measures (by A. B. Marx&#x27;s count).

<text>Nova Roma () is an international Roman reconstructionist, cultural revivalist, and educational nonprofit organization formed in 1998, later incorporated in Maine. Nova Roma is dedicated to promoting &quot;the restoration of classical Roman religion, culture, and virtues&quot; and &quot;shared Roman ideals&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinkle, A./Merriman, 464&quot;&gt;Trinkle, D. A./Merriman, S. A: &quot;The history highway: a 21st century guide to Internet resources&quot;, p. 464. M.E. Sharpe, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable for providing extensive resources about Roman culture, Latin, ancient Roman costuming and reenactment, Nova Roma aims to be more than a community of reenactors or history study group. Based on the reconstructed Roman ceremonies and spiritual aspects of the activities of Nova Roma, Strimska, Davy, Adler, Gallagher-Ashcraft, and Chryssides have noted its importance to Roman reconstructionism. Because it has a structure based on the ancient Roman Republic, with a senate, magistrates, laws enacted by vote of the &quot;comitia&quot;, its own coinage, and its self-identity as a &quot;sovereign nation&quot;, some outside observers classify it as a micronation.

==Revival of Roman identity and traditions==

The most important goal of Nova Roma is to provide a living community for Roman reenactors, scholars and fans of ancient Rome, and to all varieties of people who self-identify as Romans in the present day modern world, and to revive those traditions through which an authentic Roman identity can be experienced and expressed. Since one of the most authentic and traditional forms of cultural self-expression for Romans was the celebration of various festivals, rites and ceremonies, Nova Roma has adopted the ancient Roman religion as its &quot;state religion&quot;, while also guaranteeing the freedom of religion of its citizens. The British scholar Michael York noted that the traditional Roman way of thinking, Roman philosophy, provides the moral code for Nova Romans.

Both the domestic traditions and the so-called are reconstructed by Nova Roma as authentically as possible, including the restoration of the ancient priestly &quot;collegia&quot;, like the offices of pontifex and flamen, and the honoring of the full cycle of Roman holidays throughout the year. According to the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, at the time of Christmas, Nova Romans celebrate the Roman holiday Saturnalia.

In 2006, Margot Adler noted the organization&#x27;s plan to restore a Magna Mater shrine in Rome.

==Live events, conventions and reenactments==

Nova Roma holds its own local and international conventions and regularly participates with its affiliated reenactment groups in such history festivals and public events as the Festival of Ancient Heritage in Svishtov, Bulgaria, the Roman Market Day in Wells, Maine&#x27;s Harbor Park, and &quot;Forum Fulvii&quot; in Italy, &quot;Ludi Savarienses&quot; Historical Carnival, the &quot;Aquincum Floralia&quot; Spring Festival in Budapest, Hungary, or the in Rome, Italy, where Nova Roma celebrated its twentieth anniversary.

==Cultural competitions and games==

Among the cultural activities of Nova Roma, competitions and games associated with various Roman festivals have an important place. They can include a wide range of various programs from humorous online games up to serious art-competitions like the &quot;Certamen Petronianum&quot;, a literary contest of historical novel writing first held in 2005, where the jury was composed of notables including Colleen McCullough, author of many Roman-themed best-selling novels, and T. P. Wiseman, university professor of Roman history and former vice-president of the British Academy, or the second edition of the same competition, where the jury was Jo Walton, World Fantasy Award-winning novelist and poet. Kristoffer From was the winner of the first &quot;Certamen Petronianum&quot;.

==Coinage and sponsorship of Roman cultural projects==

Nova Roma has minted two coins with the denomination of &quot;sestertius,&quot; one in bronze, issued in 2000, and another in brass, dating from 2005. Each bears the letters SPQR and has a diameter of 32mm, a thickness of 1.8 mm. These sesterces are convertible into 50 US cents, if sent back to the treasury of the organization, thus they can be used in place of real currency between members of the community. 

Regarding the monetary policies of Nova Roma, as a nonprofit organization, its treasury is dedicated to sponsor various Roman cultural projects, including experimental archaeology initiatives, reenactment events, or building Roman temple reconstructions, altars or other reconstructed accessories or any items from the ancient Roman period. 

== Global chapters and subsidiaries ==

The international governance of Nova Roma permits the Nova Roman communities of each country to create their national subdivision of Nova Roma, called &quot;provincia&quot;, and to form their own not-for-profit or incorporated organizations, established under the respective legislation of their local country. This enables better local recognition and management, as well as provides the means for legal and insurance coverage, such as that offered by the Australasian Living History Federation (ALHF). 

==Historical contexts==
Revival of things Roman and their co-option for symbolic importance have a long history. in its deliberate revival of grandiose remnants of the past thus parallels and echoes other New Romes such as:

* the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire as a surviving embodiment of Roman ideals based on Constantinople (sometimes characterized as &quot;New Rome&quot; or the &quot;Second Rome&quot;) after the decline of the Roman imperium in the West.
* the doctrine of the Third Rome as justification for imperial Muscovite and Russian ambitions from the 15th century onwards.
* Mussolini&#x27;s attempted construction of a Mediterranean-based New Roman Empire (compare Imperial Italy) in the early 20th century.

<doc id="434892" wikidata="Q574847" url="?curid=434892" title="Alan Reid (politician)">
<text>Alan Reid (born 7 August 1954, Ayr, Scotland) is a Scottish Liberal Democrat politician who has been a councillor in the East Dunbartonshire ward of Bearsden North since 2022.

He was previously the Member of Parliament (MP) for Argyll and Bute from 2001 to 2015, when he lost his seat to the Scottish National Party (SNP) at the 2015 general election. He was first elected at the 2001 general election.

==Background==
Reid was educated at Ayr Academy and the University of Strathclyde where he gained a BSc in Mathematics. Prior to his election to the House of Commons he worked for the University of Glasgow as a computer project manager. He remains a member of the AUT (Association of University Teachers). 

He was a councillor on Renfrew District Council from 1988 to 1996.

==Parliamentary career==
Reid contested Paisley South in a 1990 by-election and the 1992 general election and Dumbarton in 1997, before being elected for Argyll and Bute in 2001.

In the 2010 Parliament, he served on the Scottish Affairs Committee. In the previous Parliament he was the Liberal Democrat spokesman for Northern Ireland Office and Scotland Office matters. He has also served as a Liberal Democrat whip.

During the MPs expenses scandal, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; drew attention to Reid&#x27;s claims of over £1500 for stays in B&amp;B&#x27;s within his own constituency. Reid argued overnight stays were necessary where ferry timetables made it impossible to return to his constituency home, and said he had successfully challenged initially rejected expense claims by explaining the geography of Argyll and Bute.

Reid unsuccessfully stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate in his former seat of Argyll and Bute at the 2017 and 2019 general elections 

==2016 Scottish Parliament Elections==

At the 2016 Scottish Parliamentary elections, Reid stood for the constituency of Argyll and Bute. 

==Argyll and Bute Council==

At the Scottish local government elections held In May 2017, Reid stood as a candidate for the 3 member Ward of Cowal (Ward 6) in Argyll and Bute Council. Reid finished in third place, behind William Blair (SNP) and Yvonne McNeilly (Scottish Conservative), and received 791 first preference votes (22.7% of votes cast). Reid was duly elected as a councillor for the Ward of Cowal. At the Scottish local government elections held in May 2022, Reid did not seek re-election for the Cowal ward, and was replaced as a Liberal Democrat councillor for the ward of Cowal by William Sinclair at the 2022 Scottish Local Government elections. Reid instead chose to be a candidate for the ward of Bearsden North in East Dunbartonshire Council.

==2021 Scottish Parliament Elections==

He was the lead list candidate for the Liberal Democrats in the Highlands and Islands electoral region for the 2021 Scottish Parliamentary elections as well as being the constituency candidate for Argyll and Bute. The Liberal Democrat vote share in the Highlands and Islands region fell from 13.3% at the 2016 elections to 11.2%. Reid&#x27;s vote share in the constituency vote fell from 25.7% at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election to 20.5%, and he finished third in Argyll and Bute.

==East Dunbartonshire Council==
For the 2022 Scottish local elections, Reid was announced as a candidate for Bearsden North in East Dunbartonshire. On 6 May 2022, he was elected in this 3-member ward alongside Calum Smith of the SNP and independent candidate Duncan Cumming. He finished fourth on the first round of voting with 12.42% of the vote (which was a fall in the vote share of 17.97% achieved by the previous Liberal Democrat candidate Rosie O&#x27;Neill, who was elected as a councillor for the ward at the 2016 Scottish Local Government Elections) and he was elected at the sixth stage of the voting process. 

==General Election 2024==

In November 2023, Reid was selected to contest Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber at the 2024 general election. This was a new constituency, following the boundary changes which took effect at the 2024 General Election. He polled 16.4% of the vote in the constituency at the election, a 2.3% increase in the vote share compared to the notional result for the constituency at the previous General Election in 2019.

<doc id="434894" wikidata="Q269124" url="?curid=434894" title="Alistair Carmichael">
<text>Alexander Morrison &quot;Alistair&quot; Carmichael (born 15 July 1965) is a British politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Orkney and Shetland since 2001. A member of the Liberal Democrats, he previously served in the Cameron–Clegg coalition as Secretary of State for Scotland from 2013 to 2015 and as Deputy Government Chief Whip from 2010 to 2013. He currently serves as the Chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee.

Carmichael served as Liberal Democrat Chief Whip of the House of Commons from 2010 to 2013. From 7 October 2013 to 8 May 2015, he was the Secretary of State for Scotland in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government. He served a second term as Chief Whip from 2017 to 2020, having taken over the position from Tom Brake following the 2017 general election. He was the Liberal Democrat Spokesman for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and Exiting the European Union from January 2020 to August 2020. He was previously the Deputy Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats from 2012 to 2021. He was Liberal Democrat Spokesperson for Home Affairs, Justice and for Northern Ireland until his election as select committee chair in September 2024. 

He was the only Scottish MP representing the Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons during the 57th Parliament (2015–2017). He is the longest-serving Liberal Democrat MP and the senior Scottish MP in the current UK Parliament.

==Early life and career==
Alexander Carmichael was born on 15 July 1965 to hill farming parents on Islay in the Inner Hebrides, and went on to attend Port Ellen Primary School and Islay High School. He worked between 1984 and 1989 as a hotel manager after 2 years of study at the University of Glasgow. There, he was a member of the Students&#x27; Representative Council and President of the Liberal Club. He ultimately left his course early. He returned to education at the University of Aberdeen, where he gained an LLB in 1992, qualifying as a solicitor in 1993. From 1993 to 1996, he was a Procurator Fiscal Depute for Edinburgh and Aberdeen, and from 1996 to 2001 he was a solicitor with Aberdeen and Macduff.

==Parliamentary career==
Carmichael first stood for Parliament at Paisley South in 1987, being defeated by the sitting Labour MP, Norman Buchan. He finished in second place, achieving 15.1% of the vote, which was down 9% from 1983.

At the 2001 general election, he was elected as the MP for Orkney and Shetland, succeeding the Liberal Democrat MP Jim Wallace, who had chosen to stand for the Scottish Parliament constituency of Orkney instead. Carmichael won with 41.3% of the vote, a decrease of 10.7% from the 1997 general election, and with a majority of 3,475, nearly half of the 6,968 majority won by Wallace in 1997. One of the constituency&#x27;s previous MPs was the Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond.

Carmichael was re-elected at the 2005 general election with an increased vote share of 51.5% and an increased majority of 6,627.

Carmichael was appointed Liberal Democrat Northern Ireland and Scotland Spokesman by Sir Menzies Campbell in July 2007, but resigned in March 2008 to vote in favour of a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. He was reappointed to the position by Nick Clegg in October 2008. He had also briefly served as the Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman, following the resignation of Mark Oaten.

In June 2009, Carmichael was involved in a successful campaign against the book by Max Scratchmann, &quot;Chucking it All: How Downsizing to a Windswept Scottish Island Did Absolutely Nothing to Improve My Life&quot;, an irreverent account of the author&#x27;s experience downshifting from Manchester to Orkney, which Carmichael said was &quot;hurtful and vindictive&quot;, and attacked a number of &quot;clearly identifiable&quot; residents of the islands. Carmichael&#x27;s complaints to the publisher led them to cancel publication.

Carmichael was re-elected at the 2010 general election with an increased vote share of 62.0% and an increased majority of 9,928. 

At the beginning of the Liberal Democrat - Conservative coalition government in May 2010, Carmichael was appointed Deputy Chief Whip and Comptroller of the Household.

In 2011, Carmichael was elected Honorary President of the Scottish Liberal Democrats youth wing, Liberal Youth Scotland.

===Deputy Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats and Secretary of State for Scotland===
Carmichael took over from Jo Swinson as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats on 23 September 2012 at the Annual Liberal Democrat Conference in Brighton.

In October 2013, he was promoted by Nick Clegg to the position of Secretary of State for Scotland in the UK Cabinet, replacing Michael Moore.

Carmichael retained his seat at the 2015 general election, the only Liberal Democrat in Scotland out of 11 MPs elected in 2010 who managed to do so. He was re-elected, but saw his vote share decrease by 20.6%, and saw his majority cut from 9,928 to just 817. Carmichael was one of only eight Liberal Democrat MPs returned to Parliament.

Following the resignation of Nick Clegg as party leader, Alistair Carmichael took temporary charge of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons, under the de facto leadership of Party President Sal Brinton.

====Campaign memo and election petition====
On 4 April 2015, during the general election campaign Carmichael was involved in the leaking of a memo from the Scotland Office about comments allegedly made by the French ambassador Sylvie Bermann about Nicola Sturgeon, claiming that Sturgeon had privately stated she would &quot;rather see David Cameron remain as PM&quot;, in contrast to her publicly stated opposition to a Conservative government. The veracity of the memo was quickly denied by the French ambassador, French Consul General and Sturgeon herself.

At the time of the leak, Carmichael denied all knowledge of the leaking of the memo in a television interview with Channel 4 News. After the election, Carmichael accepted the contents of the memo were incorrect, and admitted that he had lied, and that he had authorised the leaking of the inaccurate memo to the media. This was after a Cabinet Office enquiry identified Carmichael&#x27;s role in the leak. The enquiry found phone records that proved Euan Roddin, Carmichael&#x27;s Special Adviser, contacted the &quot;Telegraph &quot;on 1 April, two days before the story appeared. Carmichael apologised and accepted that had he still been a government minister, this was a matter that would have &quot;required [his] resignation&quot;.

Four electors from Orkney and Shetland lodged an election petition on 29 May 2015, the last date possible to do this following the general election on 7 May, attempting to unseat Carmichael and force a by-election. On 2 June 2015, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner launched an investigation into his conduct, under sections 10, 14 and 16 of the Code of Conduct, but this investigation was dropped because Carmichael became aware of the memo via the Scottish Office and not in his capacity as an MP. On 9 December 2015, it was decided it had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt that he had committed an &quot;illegal practice&quot; and he was allowed to retain his seat. In February 2016, his application for costs was rejected, leaving him £150,000 out of pocket. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie contributed £750 towards his costs. Carmichael was awarded £50,000 towards the costs from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust.

Carmichael was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election with an increased vote share of 48.6% and an increased majority of 4,563. He was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 44.8% and a decreased majority of 2,507. At the 2024 general election, Carmichael was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 55.1% and an increased majority of 7,807.

=== After the 2024 General Election ===
On 9 September 2024, Alistair Carmichael was elected as Chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee.

==Personal life==
He married Kathryn Jane Eastham in 1987. They have two sons (born in 1997 and 2001) and the family reside in Orkney where she is a local veterinary surgeon. He speaks French and German. Carmichael is an elder in the Church of Scotland.

<doc id="434895" wikidata="Q163616" url="?curid=434895" title="String Quartet No. 1 (Beethoven)">
<text>The String Quartet No. 1 in F major, Op. 18, No. 1, was written by Ludwig van Beethoven between 1798 and 1800, published in 1801. The complete set of six quartets was commissioned by and dedicated to the Bohemian aristocrat Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz. It is actually the second string quartet that Beethoven composed, following his third.

==Structure==
The quartet consists of four movements:

# Allegro con brio (F major)
# Adagio affettuoso ed appassionato (D minor)
# Scherzo: Allegro molto (F major) - Trio (B-flat major)
# Allegro (F major)

The theme of the finale is almost directly borrowed from the finale of his earlier string trio, Op. 9, No. 3 in C minor; the themes are very closely related. The principal theme of the first movement echoes that of Mozart&#x27;s Violin Sonata No. 32 K. 454 (1784) and Haydn&#x27;s 1787 Opus 50, No. 1 quartet.

==History==
According to , Beethoven&#x27;s friend, the second movement was inspired by the crypt scene from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The quartet was heavily revised between the version that Amenda first received, and that was dedicated to him, and the one that was sent to the publisher a year later, including changing the second movement&#x27;s marking from &quot;Adagio molto&quot; to the more specific &quot;Adagio affettuoso ed appassionato&quot;. Of these modifications, Beethoven wrote: &quot;Be sure not to hand on to anybody your quartet, in which I have made some drastic alterations. For only now have I learnt to write quartets; and this you will notice, I fancy, when you receive them.&quot;

The &quot;Amenda&quot; manuscript, as it is sometimes known, was edited by Paul Mies and published by Bärenreiter around 1965, and by G. Henle Verlag of Munich (perhaps also edited by Mies) in 1962. This early version of one of Beethoven&#x27;s best-known works has been recorded perhaps fewer than a half-dozen times as of July 2014.

==In popular culture==

The second movement of the Juilliard String Quartet&#x27;s recording is used in the soundtrack to the 2015 film &quot;The Lobster&quot;.

<doc id="434896" wikidata="Q480184" url="?curid=434896" title="Angus Robertson">
<text>Angus Struan Carolus Robertson (born 28 September 1969) is a Scottish politician serving as the Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, External Affairs and Culture since 2021. Formerly Depute Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 2016 to 2018, he has served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Edinburgh Central since 2021. Robertson previously served as a Westminster MP for Moray from 2001 to 2017, where he served from 2007 to 2017 as the Leader of the SNP in the House of Commons.

A graduate of the University of Aberdeen, Robertson previously worked as a journalist. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 2001. In 2017, he sought re-election as the MP for Moray and lost to the Scottish Conservative candidate, Douglas Ross. He was succeeded as SNP Westminster Leader by Ian Blackford.

Robertson resigned as SNP Depute Leader in February 2018, before launching the pro-independence think tank Progress Scotland in 2019, alongside Mark Diffley. In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Robertson was elected to the Scottish Parliament for Edinburgh Central.

==Early life and career==
Robertson was born in Wimbledon, London, to a Scottish father, Struan, who was an engineer, and a German mother, Anna, who was a nurse. Robertson was brought up in Edinburgh and speaks fluent German. He was educated at Broughton High School, Edinburgh and the University of Aberdeen, where he graduated in 1991 with an MA Honours degree in politics and international relations. After university he embarked on a journalistic career, and worked as a foreign and diplomatic correspondent in Central Europe for the BBC World Service.

Robertson joined the Scottish National Party in 1984, at the age of 15, after being given a leaflet about the party&#x27;s youth wing by Charlie Reid of The Proclaimers. He was the European and International Affairs Adviser to the SNP Group in the Scottish Parliament.

==Member of Parliament (2001–2017)==
===2001 general election===
Robertson was first elected to the UK House of Commons in June 2001, representing the Moray constituency. During his first parliamentary session, Robertson was Scotland&#x27;s youngest MP and was rated Scotland&#x27;s &quot;hardest working MP&quot; according to statistics from the House of Commons. He was a member of the European Scrutiny Committee from 2001 to 2010, and served as the SNP&#x27;s spokesman on Defence and International Relations. Robertson was well above average amongst MPs in the number of contributions he made in the House of Commons. In January 2006, Robertson provided Swiss Senator Dick Marty a report containing what he calls &#x27;a detailed report of numerous suspect movements of aircraft transiting through Scotland.

=== Leader of the SNP in the House of Commons (2007–2017)===

In May 2007, he became SNP Leader in the House of Commons, following Alex Salmond&#x27;s election as First Minister of Scotland. 

In 2007 Robertson pushed for a UK-wide referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, something that the SNP opposed because it entrenched EU control over Scottish affairs. &quot;We&#x27;ll trust the people, while Gordon Brown will not trust the people,&quot; Robertson told &quot;The Daily Record&quot;, &quot;We are honour-bound to support a referendum.&quot;

Ahead of the 2015 General Election, Robertson had the SNP pass a code of conduct that stated any MP must, &quot;accept that no member shall within or outwith the parliament publicly criticise a group decision, policy or another member of the group&quot;. Rival parties labelled it a &quot;Stalinist&quot; crackdown on free speech and independent thought. Following the 2015 general election and the election of Salmond as MP for Gordon, it was confirmed that he would continue in his role as leader in the Commons. In September 2015, he was appointed to the Privy Council and as a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament.

In 2018 it was revealed that Robertson had been contacted a decade ago by staff at Edinburgh Airport about the alleged behaviour of then First Minister Alex Salmond. Robertson said: &quot;In 2009 I was called by an Edinburgh Airport manager about Alex Salmond&#x27;s perceived &#x27;inappropriateness&#x27; towards female staff at the airport. I was asked if I could informally broach the subject with Mr Salmond to make him aware of this perception. I raised the matter directly with Mr Salmond, who denied he had acted inappropriately in any way. I communicated back to the Edinburgh Airport manager that a conversation had happened. The matter being resolved, and without a formal complaint having been made, it was not reported further.&quot; It was subsequently reported that Salmond had been banned from using a VIP access corridor at the airport. Robertson&#x27;s handling of the allegations was later investigated by the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints in 2020 and he submitted written evidence.

In January 2016, Robertson said that British Prime Minister David Cameron should admit to British involvement in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen: &quot;Isn&#x27;t it time for the Prime Minister to admit that Britain is effectively taking part in a war in Yemen that is costing thousands of civilians lives and he has not sought parliamentary approval to do this?&quot;

=== Depute Leader of the SNP ===

On 13 October 2016, he was elected Depute Leader of the SNP, replacing Stewart Hosie. Robertson received 52.5% of the votes, defeating Tommy Sheppard (25.5%), Alyn Smith (18.6%) and Chris McEleny (3.3%) in the election. He resigned in February 2018.

=== 2017 general election ===

During the 2017 general election Robertson told the media that &quot;Tory is a four letter word in Scotland&quot;, but amid a backlash to Nicola Sturgeon&#x27;s decision to call for a second independence referendum, he lost his Moray seat to Douglas Ross of the Scottish Conservatives. 

In a profile of the seat for &quot;The Guardian&quot; after the election, journalist Severin Carrell summarised the result: &quot;Moray had been an SNP seat for 30 years but... using Brexit as the basis for a second independence vote so soon after 2014 crystallised an irritation with the party brewing for several years. The Tory cry that Sturgeon needed “to get on with the day job” resonated.&quot;

After losing his seat, Robertson resigned as a Depute Leader of the SNP and established &quot;Progress Scotland&quot;, a pro-independence think-tank.

In February 2020, Robertson announced his intention to contest the Edinburgh Central constituency in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. He won selection ahead of Marco Biagi, a former MSP for the area. Robertson won the seat with 39% of the vote, beating out the Scottish Conservative candidate by 4,732 votes.

Ahead of the selection contest for the seat of Edinburgh Central, the SNP National Executive Committee announced that any MP chosen as a candidate for Holyrood would be obliged to resign from Westminster ahead of the election to the Scottish Parliament. Some considered the rule change a deliberate &quot;stitch up&quot; by the SNP establishment to stop MP Joanna Cherry, a critic of the party leadership, from winning the party&#x27;s nomination for the seat and boost the candidacy of Angus Robertson, a leadership loyalist. Cherry dropped out of the contest, citing an unwillingness to make her staff unemployed in a pandemic, and Robertson won the party&#x27;s nomination.

== Cabinet Secretary for Constitution, External Affairs and Culture (2021–present)==
In May 2021, following the SNP&#x27;s victory, he was appointed Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, External Affairs and Culture by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Alex Cole-Hamilton of the Scottish Liberal Democrats said his party could not support the role, filled by Robertson. He stated &quot;not one minute&quot; of ministerial or civil service time should given to the &quot;tired, old arguments about currency and about borders&quot;. However, his amendment to a Scottish Government motion appointing new ministers was rejected by 70 votes to four, with 51 abstentions.

In 2022 Robertson was charged with overseeing Scotland&#x27;s decennial census. However, when only 77% of households returned the census - compared with a rate of 97% for the one in England and Wales the previous year - Robertson extended the deadline at a cost of nearly £10 million. Robertson said the Russian invasion of Ukraine was partly to blame but told the Scottish Parliament there were &quot;potentially serious consequences for not completing a census&quot;. Opposition politicians labelled Robertson&#x27;s handling of the census &quot;nothing short of disastrous&quot; and said the SNP had been foolish not to hold it at the same time as the rest of the country when there was a significant amount of UK-wide publicity about the event.

Robertson was subsequently reappointed Constitution Secretary by both Humza Yousaf in 2023 and John Swinney in 2024.

==Controversies==
In September 2014, Robertson – and three of his SNP colleagues – were criticised by &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and Labour MPs after they missed a vote on an amendment to the bedroom tax that would have exempted certain people in certain circumstances - with critics making the point that the SNP had made opposition to the bedroom tax a central part of its campaign for a yes vote in that year&#x27;s independence referendum. The Labour&#x27;s Johann Lamont said: &quot;Far from standing up for Scotland, the SNP have stayed at home and let Scotland down.&quot; The SNP&#x27;s Philippa Whitford responded: &quot;This vote demonstrates exactly why we need independence. This was a defeat for the UK government but it doesn’t end the bedroom tax.&quot; In December 2014 Robertson did turn up to division on the issue and voted for a Labour motion to scrap it. Although Andrew George&#x27;s Affordable Homes Bill passed at the vote thanks to Labour and Liberal Democrat votes, it did not progress to become law as the Conservative government did not supply a Money Resolution required for the next stage of the process.

In 2015, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Robertson&#x27;s second home expenses had included a television costing £1,119, a £400 home cinema system, £500 for a bed, £20 for a corkscrew and £2,324 for a sofa bed. The home cinema system was initially denied by the expenses office; however, Robertson appealed this decision and it was subsequently awarded.

In 2017 it was reported in several newspapers that Robertson had sold his second home in London, the mortgage on which was paid on expenses, as part of his divorce settlement. Robertson had previously pledged to repay the value of the expenses on the property and donate any profit to charity.

In September 2020, Robertson wrote that a rise in support for independence in opinion polls could be attributed to, &quot;55,000 predominantly No supporting older voters passing away every year... Since 2014, this has added around 330,000 voters to the electorate, with a likely net gain of over 100,000 for independence.” His remarks were condemned as tasteless by opposition parties and his successor as MP for Moray, Douglas Ross, described them as, &quot;Disgraceful and deeply disappointing comments from Angus Robertson, suggesting that the most vulnerable age group, who have been hardest hit through the tragic loss of so many lives throughout the pandemic, are a boost to his independence obsession. A new low for the SNP.” Robertson said his analysis was &quot;simple statistical facts&quot;.

==Personal life==

Robertson&#x27;s second wife, Jennifer Dempsie, is a former advisor to Alex Salmond. She campaigned to inherit Salmond&#x27;s Scottish Parliament seat in Aberdeenshire East but withdrew to focus on her business career.

Outside politics Robertson is a music fan, and particularly likes Metallica and Belle and Sebastian. He is a supporter of the Heart of Midlothian football team.

On 29 May 2021, he announced the birth of his second child.

== Honours ==
In August 2016, he was awarded the Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold for Services to the Austrian Republic.

<doc id="434897" wikidata="Q195076" url="?curid=434897" title="Hough transform">
<text>The Hough transform () is a feature extraction technique used in image analysis, computer vision, pattern recognition, and digital image processing. The purpose of the technique is to find imperfect instances of objects within a certain class of shapes by a voting procedure. This voting procedure is carried out in a parameter space, from which object candidates are obtained as local maxima in a so-called accumulator space that is explicitly constructed by the algorithm for computing the Hough transform. Mathematically it is simply the Radon transform in the plane, known since at least 1917, but the Hough transform refers to its use in image analysis. 

The classical Hough transform was concerned with the identification of lines in the image, but later the Hough transform has been extended to identifying positions of arbitrary shapes, most commonly circles or ellipses. The Hough transform as it is universally used today was invented by Richard Duda and Peter Hart in 1972, who called it a &quot;generalized Hough transform&quot; after the related 1962 patent of Paul Hough. The transform was popularized in the computer vision community by Dana H. Ballard through a 1981 journal article titled &quot;Generalizing the Hough transform to detect arbitrary shapes&quot;.

== History ==

It was initially invented for machine analysis of bubble chamber photographs (Hough, 1959).

The Hough transform was patented as in 1962 and assigned to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission with the name &quot;Method and Means for Recognizing Complex Patterns&quot;. This patent uses a slope-intercept parametrization for straight lines, which awkwardly leads to an unbounded transform space, since the slope can go to infinity.

The rho–theta parametrization universally used today was first described in
although it was already standard for the Radon transform since at least the 1930s.

O&#x27;Gorman and Clowes&#x27; variation is described in

The story of how the modern form of the Hough transform was invented is given in

==Theory==

In automated analysis of digital images, a subproblem often arises of detecting simple shapes, such as straight lines, circles or ellipses. In many cases an edge detector can be used as a pre-processing stage to obtain image points or image pixels that are on the desired curve in the image space. Due to imperfections in either the image data or the edge detector, however, there may be missing points or pixels on the desired curves as well as spatial deviations between the ideal line/circle/ellipse and the noisy edge points as they are obtained from the edge detector. For these reasons, it is often non-trivial to group the extracted edge features to an appropriate set of lines, circles or ellipses. The purpose of the Hough transform is to address this problem by making it possible to perform groupings of edge points into object candidates by performing an explicit voting procedure over a set of parameterized image objects (Shapiro and Stockman, 304).

=== Detecting lines ===
The simplest case of Hough transform is detecting straight lines. In general, the straight line can be represented as a point (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;m&quot;) in the parameter space. However, vertical lines pose a problem. They would give rise to unbounded values of the slope parameter &quot;m&quot;. Thus, for computational reasons, Duda and Hart proposed the use of the Hesse normal form

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the distance from the origin to the closest point on the straight line, and formula_3 is the angle between the formula_4 axis and the line connecting the origin with that closest point.

The intuition for this form, similarly to the plane equation, is that every vector on the line must be perpendicular (orthogonal) to the straight line of length formula_2 that comes from the origin. It can be seen that the intersection point of the function line and the perpendicular line that comes from the origin is at formula_6. So, for any point formula_7 on the line, the vector formula_8 must be orthogonal to the vector formula_9. Therefore, we get that for any point formula_10 on the function line, the equation formula_11 must be satisfied. Therefore, formula_12. Since formula_10 and formula_6, we get formula_15. Since formula_16, we get the final form of formula_17.
It is therefore possible to associate with each line of the image a pair formula_18. The formula_18 plane is sometimes referred to as &quot;Hough space&quot; for the set of straight lines in two dimensions. This representation makes the Hough transform conceptually very close to the two-dimensional Radon transform. In fact, the Hough transform is mathematically equivalent to the Radon transform, but the two transformations have different computational interpretations traditionally associated with them.

Given a &quot;single point&quot; in the plane, the set of &quot;all&quot; straight lines going through that point corresponds to a sinusoidal curve in the (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;) plane, which is unique to that point. A set of two or more points that form a straight line will produce sinusoids crossing at the (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;) for that line. Thus, the problem of detecting collinear points can be converted to the problem of finding concurrent curves.

=== Probabilistic interpretation ===
Given a shape parametrized by formula_20, taking values in the set formula_21 called the shape space, one can interpret the Hough transform as the inverse transform of a probability distribution on the image space to the shape space formula_21, and interpret shape detection as maximum likelihood estimation.

Explicitly, the Hough transform performs an approximate naive Bayes inference. We start with a uniform prior on the shape space. We consider only the positive evidence, and ignore all negative evidence, so that we can detect partially occluded shapes. 

We add up the log-likelihood in the shape space up to an additive constant. The assumption of &quot;naive Bayes&quot; means that all pixels in the image space provide independent evidence, so that their likelihoods multiply, that is, their log-likelihoods add. The freedom in additive constant allows us to perform no operation on the &quot;background pixels&quot; in shape space.

Finally, we perform maximum likelihood estimation by picking out the peaks in the log-likelihood on the shape space.

==Implementation==

The linear Hough transform algorithm estimates the two parameters that define a straight line. The transform space has two dimensions, and every point in the transform space is used as an accumulator to detect or identify a line described by formula_23. Every point in the detected edges in the image contributes to the accumulators.

The dimension of the accumulator equals the number of unknown parameters, i.e., two, considering quantized values of formula_2 and formula_3 in the pair formula_18. For each pixel at formula_27 and its neighborhood, the Hough transform algorithm determines whether there is enough evidence of a straight line at that pixel. If so, it will calculate the parameters formula_18 of that line, then look for the accumulator&#x27;s bin that the parameters fall into, and increment the value of that bin.

By finding the bins with the highest values, typically by looking for local maxima in the accumulator space, the most likely lines can be extracted, and their (approximate) geometric definitions read off (Shapiro and Stockman, 304). The simplest way of finding these &quot;peaks&quot; is by applying some form of threshold, but other techniques may yield better results in different circumstances – determining which lines are found, as well as how many. Since the lines returned do not contain any length information, it is often necessary, in the next step, to find which parts of the image match up with which lines. Moreover, due to imperfection errors in the edge-detection step, there will usually be errors in the accumulator space, which may make it non-trivial to find the appropriate peaks, and thus the appropriate lines.

The final result of the linear Hough transform is a two-dimensional array (matrix) similar to the accumulator—one dimension of this matrix is the quantized angle formula_3, and the other dimension is the quantized distance formula_2. Each element of the matrix has a value equal to the sum of the points or pixels that are positioned on the line represented by quantized parameters formula_18. So the element with the highest value indicates the straight line that is most represented in the input image.

==Examples==

===Example 1===

Consider three data points, shown here as black dots.

*For each data point, a number of lines are plotted going through it, all at different angles. These are shown here in different colours.
*The Hough transform accumulates contributions from all pixels in the detected edge. To each line, a support line exists which is perpendicular to it and which intersects the origin. In each case, one of these is shown as an arrow.
*The length (i.e. perpendicular distance to the origin) and angle of each support line is calculated. Lengths and angles are tabulated below the diagrams.
From the calculations, it can be seen that in either case the support line at 60° has a similar length.
Hence, it is understood that the corresponding lines (the blue ones in the above picture) are very similar.
One can thus assume that all points lie close to the blue line.

===Example 2===

The following is a different example showing the results of a Hough transform on a raster image containing two thick lines.

The results of this transform were stored in a matrix. Cell value represents the number of curves through any point. Higher cell values are rendered brighter. The two distinctly bright spots are the Hough parameters of the two lines. From these spots&#x27; positions, angle and distance from image center of the two lines in the input image can be determined.

==Variations and extensions==

===Using the gradient direction to reduce the number of votes===
An improvement suggested by O&#x27;Gorman and Clowes can be used to detect lines if one takes into account that the local gradient of the image intensity will necessarily be orthogonal to the edge. Since edge detection generally involves computing the intensity gradient magnitude, the gradient direction is often found as a side effect. If a given point of coordinates (&quot;x,y&quot;) happens to indeed be on a line, then the local direction of the gradient gives the &quot;θ&quot; parameter corresponding to said line, and the &quot;r&quot; parameter is then immediately obtained. (Shapiro and Stockman, 305) The gradient direction can be estimated to within 20°, which shortens the sinusoid trace from the full 180° to roughly 45°. This reduces the computation time and has the interesting effect of reducing the number of useless votes, thus enhancing the visibility of the spikes corresponding to real lines in the image.

===Kernel-based Hough transform (KHT) ===
Fernandes and Oliveira suggested an improved voting scheme for the Hough transform that allows a software implementation to achieve real-time performance even on relatively large images (e.g., 1280×960). The Kernel-based Hough transform uses the same formula_32 parameterization proposed by Duda and Hart but operates on clusters of approximately collinear pixels. For each cluster, votes are cast using an oriented elliptical-Gaussian kernel that models the uncertainty associated with the best-fitting line with respect to the corresponding cluster. The approach not only significantly improves the performance of the voting scheme, but also produces a much cleaner accumulator and makes the transform more robust to the detection of spurious lines.

===3-D kernel-based Hough transform for plane detection (3DKHT)===
Limberger and Oliveira suggested a deterministic technique for plane detection in unorganized point clouds whose cost is formula_33 in the number of samples, achieving real-time performance for relatively large datasets (up to formula_34 points on a 3.4 GHz CPU). It is based on a fast Hough-transform voting strategy for planar regions, inspired by the Kernel-based Hough transform (KHT). This 3D kernel-based Hough transform (3DKHT) uses a fast and robust algorithm to segment clusters of approximately co-planar samples, and casts votes for individual clusters (instead of for individual samples) on a (formula_35) spherical accumulator using a trivariate Gaussian kernel. The approach is several orders of magnitude faster than existing (non-deterministic) techniques for plane detection in point clouds, such as RHT and RANSAC, and scales better with the size of the datasets. It can be used with any application that requires fast detection of planar features on large datasets.

===Hough transform of curves, and its generalization for analytical and non-analytical shapes===
Although the version of the transform described above applies only to finding straight lines, a similar transform can be used for finding any shape which can be represented by a set of parameters. A circle, for instance, can be transformed into a set of three parameters, representing its center and radius, so that the Hough space becomes three dimensional. Arbitrary ellipses and curves can also be found this way, as can any shape easily expressed as a set of parameters.

The generalization of the Hough transform for detecting analytical shapes in spaces having any dimensionality was proposed by Fernandes and Oliveira. In contrast to other Hough transform-based approaches for analytical shapes, Fernandes&#x27; technique does not depend on the shape one wants to detect nor on the input data type. The detection can be driven to a type of analytical shape by changing the assumed model of geometry where data have been encoded (e.g., euclidean space, projective space, conformal geometry, and so on), while the proposed formulation remains unchanged. Also, it guarantees that the intended shapes are represented with the smallest possible number of parameters, and it allows the concurrent detection of different kinds of shapes that best fit an input set of entries with different dimensionalities and different geometric definitions (e.g., the concurrent detection of planes and spheres that best fit a set of points, straight lines and circles).

For more complicated shapes in the plane (i.e., shapes that cannot be represented analytically in some 2D space), the Generalised Hough transform is used, which allows a feature to vote for a particular position, orientation and/or scaling of the shape using a predefined look-up table.The Hough transform accumulates contributions from all pixels in the detected edge.

=== Circle detection process ===

Altering the algorithm to detect circular shapes instead of lines is relatively straightforward.

* First, we create the accumulator space, which is made up of a cell for each pixel. Initially each cell is set to 0.
* For each edge point (i, j) in the image, increment all cells which according to the equation of a circle formula_36 could be the center of a circle. These cells are represented by the letter formula_37 in the equation.
* For each possible value of formula_37 found in the previous step, find all possible values of formula_39 which satisfy the equation.
* Search for local maxima in the accumulator space. These cells represent circles that were detected by the algorithm.

If we do not know the radius of the circle we are trying to locate beforehand, we can use a three-dimensional accumulator space to search for circles with an arbitrary radius. Naturally, this is more computationally expensive.

This method can also detect circles that are partially outside of the accumulator space, as long as enough of the circle&#x27;s area is still present within it.

=== Detection of 3D objects (planes and cylinders) ===
Hough transform can also be used for the detection of 3D objects in range data or 3D point clouds. The extension of classical Hough transform for plane detection is quite straightforward. A plane is represented by its explicit equation formula_40 for which we can use a 3D Hough space corresponding to formula_41, formula_42 and formula_43. This extension suffers from the same problems as its 2D counterpart i.e., near horizontal planes can be reliably detected, while the performance deteriorates as planar direction becomes vertical (big values of formula_41 and formula_42 amplify the noise in the data). This formulation of the plane has been used for the detection of planes in the point clouds acquired from airborne laser scanning and works very well because in that domain all planes are nearly horizontal.

For generalized plane detection using Hough transform, the plane can be parametrized by its normal vector formula_46 (using spherical coordinates) and its distance from the origin formula_47 resulting in a three dimensional Hough space. This results in each point in the input data voting for a sinusoidal surface in the Hough space. The intersection of these sinusoidal surfaces indicates presence of a plane. A more general approach for more than 3 dimensions requires search heuristics to remain feasible.

Hough transform has also been used to find cylindrical objects in point clouds using a two step approach. The first step finds the orientation of the cylinder and the second step finds the position and radius.

===Using weighted features===
One common variation detail. That is, finding the bins with the highest count in one stage can be used to constrain the range of values searched in the next.

=== Carefully chosen parameter space ===
A high-dimensional parameter space for the Hough transform is not only slow, but if implemented without forethought can easily overrun the available memory. Even if the programming environment allows the allocation of an array larger than the available memory space through virtual memory, the number of page swaps required for this will be very demanding because the accumulator array is used in a randomly accessed fashion, rarely stopping in contiguous memory as it skips from index to index.

Consider the task of finding ellipses in an 800x600 image. Assuming that the radii of the ellipses are oriented along principal axes, the parameter space is four-dimensional. (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) defines the center of the ellipse, and &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; denote the two radii. Allowing the center to be anywhere in the image, adds the constraint 0&lt;x&lt;800 and 0&lt;y&lt;600. If the radii are given the same values as constraints, what is left is a sparsely filled accumulator array of more than 230 billion values.

A program thus conceived is unlikely to be allowed to allocate sufficient memory. This doesn&#x27;t mean that the problem can&#x27;t be solved, but only that new ways to constrain the size of the accumulator array are to be found, which makes it feasible. For instance:

# If it is reasonable to assume that the ellipses are each contained entirely within the image, the range of the radii can be reduced. The largest the radii can be is if the center of the ellipse is in the center of the image, allowing the edges of the ellipse to stretch to the edges. In this extreme case, the radii can only each be half the magnitude of the image size oriented in the same direction. Reducing the range of a and b in this fashion reduces the accumulator array to 57 billion values.
# Trade accuracy for space in the estimation of the center: If the center is predicted to be off by 3 on both the x and y axis this reduces the size of the accumulator array to about 6 billion values.
# Trade accuracy for space in the estimation of the radii: If the radii are estimated to each be off by 5 further reduction of the size of the accumulator array occurs, by about 256 million values.
# Crop the image to areas of interest. This is image dependent, and therefore unpredictable, but imagine a case where all of the edges of interest in an image are in the upper left quadrant of that image. The accumulator array can be reduced even further in this case by constraining all 4 parameters by a factor of 2, for a total reduction factor of 16.
By applying just the first three of these constraints to the example stated about, the size of the accumulator array is reduced by almost a factor of 1000, bringing it down to a size that is much more likely to fit within a modern computer&#x27;s memory.

==== Efficient ellipse detection algorithm ====

Yonghong Xie and Qiang Ji give an efficient way of implementing the Hough transform for ellipse detection by overcoming the memory issues. As discussed in the algorithm (on page 2 of the paper), this approach uses only a one-dimensional accumulator (for the minor axis) in order to detect ellipses in the image. The complexity is O(N3) in the number of non-zero points in the image.

==Limitations==
The Hough transform is only efficient if a high number of votes fall in the right bin, so that the bin can be easily detected amid the background noise. This means that the bin must not be too small, or else some votes will fall in the neighboring bins, thus reducing the visibility of the main bin.

Also, when the number of parameters is large (that is, when we are using the Hough transform with typically more than three parameters), the average number of votes cast in a single bin is very low, and those bins corresponding to a real figure in the image do not necessarily appear to have a much higher number of votes than their neighbors. The complexity increases at a rate of formula_48 with each additional parameter, where formula_49 is the size of the image space and formula_50 is the number of parameters. (Shapiro and Stockman, 310) Thus, the Hough transform must be used with great care to detect anything other than lines or circles.

Finally, much of the efficiency of the Hough transform is dependent on the quality of the input data: the edges must be detected well for the Hough transform to be efficient. Use of the Hough transform on noisy images is a very delicate matter and generally, a denoising stage must be used before. In the case where the image is corrupted by speckle, as is the case in radar images, the Radon transform is sometimes preferred to detect lines, because it attenuates the noise through summation.

<text>Matvey Matveyevich Gusev () (, Vyatka, Russia–, Berlin, Germany) was a Russian astronomer who worked at Pulkovo Observatory near St. Petersburg from 1850 to 1852 and then at Vilnius Observatory.

In 1860 he founded the first scientific journal dedicated to math and physics in Russia: &quot;Vestnik matematicheskikh nauk&quot; (). He became the director of the Vilnius Observatory in 1865.

He was first to prove the non-sphericity of the Moon, concluding in 1860 that it is elongated in the direction of the Earth. He is considered one of the pioneers in using photography in astronomy, having taken pictures of the Moon and the Sun - including sunspots - while at the Vilnius observatory.

He died in Berlin, Germany in 1866. A major crater on Mars is named Gusev crater after him, and it is famed as the landing site of the Mars Exploration Rover &quot;Spirit&quot;.

<text>Michael Fraser Weir (born 24 March 1957) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Angus in Scotland from 2001 to 2017 when he lost his seat to the Conservative Party. He served as the SNP Chief Whip in the House of Commons. Weir used to be a councillor and Convenor of the General Purposes Committee of Angus District Council. Prior to his election in 2001, he was a solicitor and Partner for J&amp;DG Shiell in Brechin.

==Background==
He was born in Arbroath and educated at Arbroath High School and Aberdeen University, from where he graduated LLB in 1979. Whilst at university Weir served as president of the Aberdeen University Scottish Nationalist Association and was a member of the Students Representative Council. He has also served as a member of the national executive of the Young Scottish Nationalists and from 1984 to 1988 he served as a councillor on Angus District Council, where he was convenor of general purposes. He worked as a solicitor in Montrose and Kirkcaldy before settling in Brechin, where he was a partner (latterly senior partner) in the firm of J&amp;DG Shiell. He is married with two daughters.

==House of Commons==
Weir fought Aberdeen South in the 1987 general election, coming fourth.

He was first elected to Parliament in 2001 and in his first term was the SNP Spokesperson on Trade and Industry and Work and Pensions, as well as being a member of the Scottish Affairs Select Committee (2001–05). In 2005, Weir held the new seat of Angus which had been substantially changed in the boundary changes for that election. Although he went into the election with a notional majority of only 532 he achieved a majority of 1601 over the Conservatives. Since 2005 Mike Weir has been the SNP Westminster Spokesperson on Business and Enterprise (which includes energy) and the Environment. He has been an outspoken opponent of nuclear power and has pursued a relentless campaign on the future of the Post Office network. Mike Weir sat on the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee (2005–09) and was a member of the Chairmen&#x27;s Panel/Panel of Chairs from (2005–10). He served on the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee from 2009–10.

Weir has championed issues relating to energy including calling for &quot;social tariffs&quot; for poorer utility customers and opposing pre-payment meters

As postal affairs spokesperson Weir led SNP opposition to privatisation of the Royal Mail

He raised the issue of local driving test centre closures at Westminster

Mike Weir served as the SNP&#x27;s Chief Whip in the House of Commons during the 2015-17 Parliament.

Born free in North Carolina, he later lived and worked in Ohio, where he voted before the Civil War. Elected by the Mississippi legislature to the United States Senate as a Republican to represent Mississippi in 1870 and 1871 during the Reconstruction era, he was the first African American to serve in either house of the U.S. Congress.

During the American Civil War, Revels had helped organize two regiments of the United States Colored Troops and served as a chaplain. After serving in the Senate, Revels was appointed as the first president of Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Alcorn State University), a historically black college. He served from 1871 to 1873. Later in his life, he served again as a minister.

==Early life and education==
Revels was born free in 1827 in Fayetteville, North Carolina, to free people of color, with ancestors who had been free since before the American Revolution. His parents were of African American, European, and Native American ancestry. His mother was also specifically known to be of Scots descent. His father was a Baptist preacher.

Revels was a second cousin to Lewis Sheridan Leary, one of the men who were killed taking part in John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859, and to North Carolina lawyer and politician John S. Leary.

During his childhood, Revels was taught by a local Black woman for his early education. In 1838, at the age of 11, he went to live with his older brother, Elias B. Revels, in Lincolnton, North Carolina. He was apprenticed as a barber in his brother&#x27;s shop. Barbering was considered a respectable, steady trade for black Americans in this period. As men of all races used barbers, the trade provided black Americans an opportunity to establish networks with the white community. After Elias Revels died in 1841, his widow Mary transferred the shop to Hiram Revels before she remarried.

Revels attended the Beech Grove Quaker Seminary, a school in Union County, Indiana, founded by Quakers, and the Union Literary Institute, also known as the Darke County Seminary despite being in Randolph County, Indiana.

In 1845, Revels was ordained as a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME); he served as a preacher and religious teacher throughout the Midwest: in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, Missouri, and Kansas. &quot;At times, I met with a great deal of opposition,&quot; he later recalled. &quot;I was imprisoned in Missouri in 1854 for preaching the gospel to Negroes, though I was never subjected to violence.&quot; During these years, he voted in Ohio.

He studied religion from 1855 to 1857 at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. He became a minister in a Methodist Episcopal Church in Baltimore, Maryland, where he also served as a principal of a black high school.

During the American Civil War, Revels served as a chaplain in the United States Army. After the Union authorized establishment of the United States Colored Troops, he helped recruit and organize two black Union regiments in Maryland and Missouri. He took part at the Battle of Vicksburg in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

==Political career==
In 1865, Revels left the AME Church, the first independent black denomination in the US, and joined the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was assigned briefly to churches in Leavenworth, Kansas, and New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1866, he was called as a permanent pastor at a church in Natchez, Mississippi, where he settled with his wife and five daughters. He became an elder in the Mississippi District of the Methodist Church, continued his ministerial work, and founded schools for black children.

During Reconstruction, Revels was elected alderman in Natchez in 1868. In 1869 he was elected to represent Adams County in the Mississippi State Senate.

Congressman John R. Lynch later wrote of him in his book on Reconstruction:

Revels was comparatively a new man in the community. He had recently been stationed at Natchez as pastor in charge of the A.M.E. Church, and so far as known he had never voted, had never attended a political meeting, and of course, had never made a political speech. But he was a colored man, and presumed to be a Republican, and believed to be a man of ability and considerably above the average in point of intelligence; just the man, it was thought, the Rev. Noah Buchanan would be willing to vote for.

In January 1870, Revels presented the opening prayer in the state legislature. Lynch wrote of that occasion,

That prayer—one of the most impressive and eloquent prayers that had ever been delivered in the [Mississippi] Senate Chamber—made Revels a United States Senator. He made a profound impression upon all who heard him. It impressed those who heard it that Revels was not only a man of great natural ability but that he was also a man of superior attainments.

===Election to Senate===

At the time, as in every state, the Mississippi legislature elected U.S. senators; they were not elected by popular vote until after ratification of the 17th Amendment in 1913.

In 1870, Revels was elected by a vote of 81 to 15 in the Mississippi legislature to finish the term of one of the state&#x27;s two seats in the U.S. Senate, which had been left vacant since the Civil War. Previously, it had been held by Albert G. Brown, who withdrew from the U.S. Senate in 1861 when Mississippi seceded.

When Revels arrived in Washington, D.C., Southern Democrats in office opposed seating him in the Senate. For the two days of debate, the Senate galleries were packed with spectators at this historic event. The Democrats based their opposition on the 1857 Dred Scott Decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that people of African ancestry were not and could not be citizens. They argued that no black man was a citizen before the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, and thus Revels could not satisfy the requirement of the Senate for nine years&#x27; prior citizenship.

Supporters of Revels made arguments ranging from relatively narrow and technical issues, to fundamental arguments about the meaning of the Civil War. Among the narrower arguments was that Revels was of primarily European ancestry (an &quot;octoroon&quot;) and that the Dred Scott decision should be interpreted as applying only to those blacks who were of totally African ancestry. Supporters said that Revels had long been a citizen (as shown by his voting in Ohio) and that he had met the nine-year requirement before the Dred Scott decision changed the rules and held that blacks could not be citizens.

The more fundamental argument by Revels&#x27;s supporters was that the Civil War, and the Reconstruction amendments, had overturned &quot;Dred Scott&quot;. Because of the war and the Amendments, they argued, the subordination of the black race was no longer part of the American constitutional regime and, therefore, it would be unconstitutional to bar Revels on the basis of the pre-Civil War Constitution&#x27;s citizenship rules. One Republican Senator supporting Revels mocked opponents as still fighting the &quot;last battle-field&quot; of that war.

Senator Charles Sumner (R-Massachusetts) said, &quot;The time has passed for argument. Nothing more need be said. For a long time it has been clear that colored persons must be senators.&quot; Sumner, a Republican, later said, 
All men are created equal, says the great Declaration, and now a great act attests this verity. Today we make the Declaration a reality. ... The Declaration was only half established by Independence. The greatest duty remained behind. In assuring the equal rights of all we complete the work.

On February 25, 1870, Revels, on a party-line vote of 48 to 8, with Republicans voting in favor and Democrats voting against, became the first African American to be seated in the United States Senate. Everyone in the galleries stood to see him sworn in.

Sumner&#x27;s Massachusetts colleague, Henry Wilson, defended Revels&#x27;s election, and presented as evidence of its validity signatures from the clerks of the Mississippi House of Representatives and Mississippi State Senate, as well as that of Adelbert Ames, the military Governor of Mississippi. Wilson argued that Revels&#x27;s skin color was not a bar to Senate service, and connected the role of the Senate to Christianity&#x27;s Golden Rule of doing to others as one would have done to oneself.

===U.S. senator===
Revels advocated compromise and moderation. He vigorously supported racial equality and worked to reassure his fellow senators about the capability of African Americans. In his maiden speech to the Senate on March 16, 1870, he argued for the reinstatement of the black legislators of the Georgia General Assembly, who had been illegally ousted by white Democratic Party representatives. He said, &quot;I maintain that the past record of my race is a true index of the feelings which today animate them. They aim not to elevate themselves by sacrificing one single interest of their white fellow citizens.&quot;

He served on both the Committee of Education and Labor and the Committee on the District of Columbia. (At the time, the Congress administered the District.) Much of the Senate&#x27;s attention focused on Reconstruction issues. While Radical Republicans called for continued punishment of ex-Confederates, Revels argued for amnesty and a restoration of full citizenship, provided they swore an oath of loyalty to the United States.
Revels&#x27;s Senate term lasted a little over one year, from February 25, 1870, to March 3, 1871. He quietly and persistently, although for the most part unsuccessfully, worked for equality. He spoke against an amendment proposed by Senator Allen G. Thurman (D-Ohio) to keep the schools of Washington, D.C., segregated and argued for their integration. He nominated a young black man to the United States Military Academy; the youth was subsequently denied admission. Revels successfully championed the cause of black workers who had been barred by their color from working at the Washington Navy Yard.

The Northern press praised Revels for his oratorical abilities. His conduct in the Senate, along with that of the other black Americans who had been seated in the House of Representatives, prompted a white Congressman, James G. Blaine (R-Maine), to write in his memoir, &quot;The colored men who took their seats in both Senate and House were as a rule studious, earnest, ambitious men, whose public conduct would be honorable to any race.&quot; Revels supported bills to invest in developing infrastructure in Mississippi: to grant lands and right of way to aid the construction of the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad (41st Congress 2nd Session S. 712), and levees on the Mississippi River (41st Congress 3rd Session S. 1136).

==College president==
Revels accepted in 1871, after his term as U.S. Senator expired, appointment as the first president of Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Alcorn State University), a historically black college located in Claiborne County, Mississippi. He taught philosophy as well. In 1873, Revels took a leave of absence from Alcorn to serve as Mississippi&#x27;s secretary of state ad interim. He was dismissed from Alcorn in 1874 when he campaigned against the reelection of Governor of Mississippi Adelbert Ames. He was reappointed in 1876 by the new Democratic administration and served until his retirement in 1882.

On November 6, 1875, Revels wrote a letter to fellow Republican and President Ulysses S. Grant that was widely reprinted. Revels denounced Ames and the carpetbaggers for manipulating the black vote for personal benefit, and for keeping alive wartime hatreds:

Since reconstruction, the masses of my people have been, as it were, enslaved in mind by unprincipled adventurers, who, caring nothing for country, were willing to stoop to anything no matter how infamous, to secure power to themselves, and perpetuate it. ... . My people have been told by these schemers, when men have been placed on the ticket who were notoriously corrupt and dishonest, that they must vote for them; that the salvation of the party depended upon it; that the man who scratched a ticket was not a Republican. This is only one of the many means these unprincipled demagogues have devised to perpetuate the intellectual bondage of my people. ... The bitterness and hate created by the late civil strife has, in my opinion, been obliterated in this state, except perhaps in some localities, and would have long since been entirely obliterated, were it not for some unprincipled men who would keep alive the bitterness of the past, and inculcate a hatred between the races, in order that they may aggrandize themselves by office, and its emoluments, to control my people, the effect of which is to degrade them.

Revels remained active as a Methodist Episcopal minister in Holly Springs, Mississippi and became an elder in the Upper Mississippi District. For a time, he served as editor of the &quot;Southwestern Christian Advocate,&quot; the newspaper of the Methodist Church. He taught theology at Shaw College (now Rust College), a historically black college founded in 1866 in Holly Springs. Hiram Revels died on January 16, 1901, while attending a church conference in Aberdeen, Mississippi. He was buried at the Hillcrest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

==Legacy==
Revels&#x27;s daughter, Susie Revels Cayton, edited &quot;The Seattle Republican&quot; in Seattle, Washington. Among his grandsons were Horace R. Cayton Jr., co-author of &quot;Black Metropolis&quot;, and Revels Cayton, a labor leader. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Hiram Rhodes Revels as one of the 100 Greatest African Americans.

<doc id="434904" wikidata="Q261675" url="?curid=434904" title="Pete Wishart">
<text>Peter Wishart (born 9 March 1962) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician and musician who has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth and Kinross-shire since 2024. He previously served as the MP for Perth and North Perthshire from 2005 to 2024 and North Tayside from 2001 to 2005.

Wishart is currently the SNP Shadow Leader of the House in the House of Commons and the chair of the Scottish Affairs Select Committee. He has previously served as the SNP&#x27;s Westminster Spokesperson for the Constitution and for Culture and Sport and Chief Whip. He is also a former keyboard player of the Scottish Celtic rock bands Runrig and Big Country.

He is the longest currently-serving Scottish National Party MP, and the second longest–serving of all time after Alex Salmond.

==Background==
Born in Dunfermline in 1962, Wishart was educated at Queen Anne High School Dunfermline and Moray House College, Edinburgh. Wishart lives in Perth and has one son and enjoys walking in the Perthshire hills. Wishart is a trained community worker and has been a director of the Fast Forward charity that promotes healthy lifestyles for young people. He was a member of the Scotland Against Drugs Campaign Committee and has contributed to many national forums looking at the problem of drugs within Scottish society.

==Music==
Wishart was, for 15 years, a member of the Scottish group Runrig.

Wishart appeared on Kingfishers Catch Fire &quot;Radio Kampala&quot; with Clive Parker on the songs &quot;Bella&quot; and &quot;Battle Scars&quot;.

Pete Wishart&#x27;s first major band was Big Country which he joined in the early 1980s, along with his brother Alan. He initially joined during a period when Big Country were a support act for Alice Cooper&#x27;s tour. The main force behind Big Country was Stuart Adamson, himself from near Dunfermline. Adamson claimed that the early Big Country were thrown off the Alice Cooper tour for &quot;being too weird&quot;.

After the departure of Richard Cherns in February 1986, Wishart joined Runrig. Wishart was a performer on seven of Runrig&#x27;s studio albums, from &quot;The Cutter and the Clan&quot; (1987), to his last &quot;The Stamping Ground&quot; (2001). He also appears on several of Runrig&#x27;s live albums. Wishart&#x27;s tenure in the band coincided with their sign-up to the Chrysalis Records label, and their most successfully commercial period in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Wishart was not the only politically minded member of the band – former lead singer Donnie Munro became a Labour Party candidate.

Wishart is a founder member of the parliamentary rock group MP4. The other members are Ian Cawsey (bass guitar and vocals), Greg Knight (drums) and Kevin Brennan (lead guitar and vocals).

==House of Commons==
He was first elected to the House of Commons at the 2001 general election, taking John Swinney&#x27;s old seat of North Tayside. Since arriving at Westminster, he has served as the SNP&#x27;s Chief Whip, in which role he has pressed the government for greater parliamentary rights, such as better representation on committees, for both the SNP and other minor political parties. He has also campaigned for copyright term extension and is a vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Intellectual Property Group.

In 2003, he voted against parliamentary approval for the invasion of Iraq.

In the light of the reduction in the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster, Wishart&#x27;s former constituency was abolished in a radical boundary revision, and at the 2005 general election; he won the new constituency of Perth and North Perthshire for the SNP with a majority of 1,521 over Douglas Taylor of the Conservatives. The Perth and North Perthshire constituency was created after boundary changes in Scotland and takes in East and Highland Perthshire, the City of Perth and the Carse of Gowrie. Wishart sat on the Scottish Affairs Select Committee.

In November 2010, Wishart suggested that Scottish football referees should declare which club sides they support.

In August 2014, Wishart confidently predicted that Alex Salmond would beat Alistair Darling in a televised debate about Scottish independence, telling journalists that &quot;the slaughter will be worse than the Bannockburn re-enactment&quot;. Salmond quizzed Darling, among other things, about alien invasion, while Darling questioned him about what currency an independent Scotland would use. An exit poll suggested most viewers thought Darling had won the debate and journalists panned Salmond&#x27;s performance.

In January 2015, Wishart secured and started a debate on the reform of the House of Lords.

Politically, he is well known for campaigning to demolish the historic and listed Perth City Hall, dating from 1911, and replace it with an open square. He has described the building as &quot;unused, unloved and increasingly unwelcome&quot;, &quot;a building whose time has passed&quot;, and said that, &quot;A city square will allow us to attract visitors, grow our café quarter, put on outdoor events and properly organise civic and community events. Every city needs civic space and we must ensure that we will soon have ours.&quot;

Following the 2015 general election, it was announced in June 2015 that he would chair the Scottish Affairs Select Committee, with his appointment formally announced on 19 June 2015.
At the snap 2017 general election, he retained his seat by a very marginal majority, beating Conservative Ian Duncan by just 21 votes. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described Wishart&#x27;s win as &quot;a rare bright moment for the Nationalists&quot; in an election that saw the SNP vote plummet and pro-Union parties gain 21 seats.

In 2016, Wishart suggested to the House of Commons the possibility of the Palace of Westminster being turned into a tourist attraction and for Parliament to move to a more modern building.

Wishart said publicly, in September 2017, that because voters were &quot;weary of constitutional change&quot; there should be no second referendum on Scottish independence for that parliament, but that the SNP should seek a mandate for a new one in the 2021 Scottish parliament election. In October 2017, Wishart told an Institute of Economic Affairs conference that federalism for the UK should be welcomed &quot;as part of that conversation&quot; in Scotland, although he stressed federalism would not see Scotland &quot;equal to some region of England&quot;.

In January 2018, Wishart drew media attention for holding up a placard which read &quot;nul points&quot; in the House of Commons, after having asked Prime Minister Theresa May how she would rate her government&#x27;s handling of Brexit from one to ten. After May had answered, Wishart received a warning by Speaker of the House John Bercow for the stunt.

In February 2018, he warned that the SNP risked alienating Scottish voters who had voted &quot;Leave&quot; in the 2016 referendum on European Union membership. In an article for &quot;The National&quot;, he wrote that his party had to &quot;face up&quot; to the reality that Scotland would be leaving the European Union, and made the case for an alternative vision of Scottish independence which involved a &quot;graduated&quot; re-entry to the European Union from &quot;EEA, then EFTA then full EU membership&quot;, stressing that the final step of re-joining the EU should only be done with the &quot;full consent of an independent Scottish Parliament&quot;. Later in February, he ruled himself out of the 2018 Scottish Depute Leadership election following the resignation of Angus Robertson. Wishart concluded that he did not have &quot;sufficient support&quot; to run for the Depute Leadership of the Scottish National Party.

In March 2024, he criticised Humza Yousaf&#x27;s election strategy saying he won&#x27;t use any &quot;Tory-free rhetoric&quot; in his campaign for the 2024 general election.

<doc id="434906" wikidata="Q333007" url="?curid=434906" title="John Maples">
<text>John Cradock Maples, Baron Maples (22 April 1943 – 9 June 2012) was a British politician and life peer who served as Economic Secretary to the Treasury from 1989 to 1992. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Lewisham West from 1983 to 1992 and Stratford-upon-Avon from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
John Cradock Maples was born at Fareham, Hampshire. His father, a businessman, lived in the Wirral; he was educated at Marlborough College, before going up to Downing College, Cambridge, where he read law, and played hockey for the college and performed with the Footlights. Maples received an MA in 1964, and later studied at the Harvard Business School. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1965.

In the 1960s, Maples founded the Cayman Islands law firm of Maples and Calder with James MacDonald and Douglas Calder.

==Parliamentary career==

=== 1983–1992: MP for Lewisham West ===
Maples was the MP for Lewisham West from 1983, until he lost the seat at the 1992 general election. His business background attracted him to the Treasury benches: Margaret Thatcher appointed him Parliamentary Private Secretary to Norman Lamont, then Economic Secretary to the Treasury. On Nigel Lawson&#x27;s resignation in 1989, Lamont was made Chief Secretary to the Treasury, with Maples moving up to take Lamont&#x27;s former role. During his time as Economic Secretary from 1989 to 1990, Maples was instrumental in working with David Cameron on the policy to enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism, with the pound sterling pegged designed to track the German deutschmark. In 1990, Maples had been appointed as Economic Secretary before the change of Prime Ministers. He dealt with the BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International) case. The Arab bank was based in London, and fell prey to the subsequent Arms to Iraq scandals and collapsed, bankrupting its depositors. He was also responsible for monitoring the Bank of England&#x27;s monetary policy, which included bank regulation.

At the 1992 general election he lost the Lewisham seat to Labour. He returned to the House of Commons at the following general election, in 1997; in the interim he was Chairman of Saatchi and Saatchi, the advertising and lobbying group, which had supported Thatcher.

=== 1997–2010: MP for Stratford-on-Avon ===
In 1995, after Stratford-upon-Avon MP Alan Howarth defected to Labour, Maples won the selection battle to replace him as Conservative candidate for the constituency, defeating local resident Maureen Hicks, former MP for Wolverhampton North East, who had likewise lost her seat in 1992. Maples went on to be elected for the seat, which was one of the Conservatives&#x27; safest, in 1997. He was re-elected in both the 2001 and 2005 general elections.

Maples was a member of William Hague&#x27;s shadow cabinet from 1997 to 2000, holding the Health, Defence and Foreign Policy briefs in succession. While Shadow Foreign Secretary, he was caught apparently calling for Britain to help Vladimir Putin in the Second Chechen War, by saying that &quot;because there is nothing we can do about it anyway.&quot;

In the reshuffle prompted by the return of Michael Portillo to the front bench, he lost his job to Francis Maude and left the shadow cabinet. Maples had been widely believed to be one of the main &quot;plotters&quot; behind the downfall of then Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith.

He returned to front bench politics in a minor reshuffle in November 2006, when David Cameron appointed him Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party with responsibility for candidate selection. He replaced ex-shadow cabinet minister Bernard Jenkin. Because of Cameron&#x27;s high-profile attempts to have more female and minority candidates selected, which met with some opposition from local parties, the post was seen as an important one. Maples was a Cameron loyalist, and elevated to the House of Lords in July 2010. While an MP, Maples was president of the Conservative Friends of Israel.

In the 2009 MP&#x27;s expenses scandal it emerged that Maples had claimed the Royal Automobile Club as his principal residence though according to his obituary he immediately denied any wrongdoing.
On 10 January 2010, Maples announced that he would stand down from the House of Commons at the general election which was held that May.

=== 2010–2012: Life peer ===
On 24 June 2010, in the Dissolution Honours List, Maples was created a Life Peer as Baron Maples, &quot;of Stratford-upon-Avon in the County of Warwickshire&quot;.

During a Lords debate on voting reform in November 2010, Lord Maples compared Lewisham West unfavourably with his other former constituency, Stratford-upon-Avon, stating that they &quot;could not be more different&quot;. He claimed that Lewisham West was &quot;three square miles of concrete&quot;, did not have an &quot;identity&quot;, and that many of its constituents &quot;did not know which borough they lived in&quot;. He added that Stratford-upon-Avon had a &quot;very articulate&quot; electorate and Lewisham West had &quot;immigration and housing problems&quot;. Lord Maples was working on the Financial Services Bill from the joint Parliamentary Finance Committee.

==Personal life==
Maples married designer Lawry Kennedy (1946–1982), who was one of the first people to renovate early 1900s brick townhouses to help gentrify abandoned and rundown areas in Boston in the United States, and London in England. They married on the Rhode Island oceanfront in July 1976; she divorced him in July 1980. He married journalist Jane Corbin in December 1986 in Westminster. The couple had a son (Tom, b. 1989) and a daughter (Rose, b. 1992). 

Maples died at the Harley Street Clinic in Weymouth Street, Westminster, on 9 June 2012 from cancer, aged 69; his death was announced in the Lords by Baroness D&#x27;Souza.

<doc id="434907" wikidata="Q440363" url="?curid=434907" title="Brett Hull">
<text>Brett Andrew Hull (born August 9, 1964) is a Canadian–American former ice hockey player and general manager, and currently an executive vice president of the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Calgary Flames, St. Louis Blues, Dallas Stars, Detroit Red Wings, and Phoenix Coyotes between 1986 and 2005. His career total of 741 goals is fifth highest in NHL history, and he is one of five players to score 50 goals in 50 games. He was a member of two Stanley Cup winning teams — 1999 with the Dallas Stars and 2002 with the Detroit Red Wings. In 2017, Hull was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.

Known as one of the game&#x27;s greatest snipers, Hull was an elite scorer at all levels of the game. He played college hockey for the University of Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs, where he scored 52 goals in 1985–86. He scored 50 the following year with the Moncton Golden Flames of the American Hockey League (AHL) and had five consecutive NHL seasons of at least 50 goals. His 86 goals in 1990–91 is the third-highest single-season total in NHL history, with the first two being the same person, Wayne Gretzky. Hull won the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson Award that year as the league&#x27;s most valuable player. He was named a first team all-star on three occasions and played in eight NHL All-Star Games.

Having dual citizenship in Canada and the United States, (after being cut from Team Canada) Hull was eligible to play for the United States internationally and chose to join the American National Team. He was a member of the team that won the 1996 World Cup of Hockey and was a two-time Olympian, winning a silver medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Hull was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009, joining his father Bobby Hull. They are the first father-son combination to each score either of 600 goals or 1,000 career points in the NHL. Hull&#x27;s nickname, &quot;the Golden Brett&quot; is a reference to his father&#x27;s nickname of &quot;the Golden Jet&quot;. His jersey number 16 was retired by the St. Louis Blues in 2006.

==Early life==
Hull was born August 9, 1964, in Belleville, Ontario, Canada. His father, Bobby, was a long-time professional hockey player in both the National Hockey League (NHL) and World Hockey Association (WHA). His mother, Joanne (McKay), was an American professional figure skater and taught him how to skate. He has three brothers, Bobby Jr., Blake, and Bart, and a younger sister, Michelle. Bart played professional football in the Canadian Football League (CFL). His uncle Dennis was also a longtime NHL player.

As his father played for the NHL&#x27;s Chicago Black Hawks, Hull spent his early life in Illinois, and he first played organized hockey in the Chicago area at age four. He and his brothers often skated with the Black Hawks where they watched their father play. The family moved back to Canada when Bobby signed with the original Winnipeg Jets, then in the WHA, in 1972. As a youth, Hull and teammate Richard Kromm played in the 1977 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Winnipeg South Monarchs minor ice hockey team. He moved to Vancouver with his mother and two youngest siblings shortly before his parents&#x27; acrimonious divorce in 1979. Hull was not close to his father following the breakup, though the two spoke periodically.

==Playing career==

===Junior and college===
Admitting that he was viewed as a &quot;pudgy, fun-loving, music-crazed bum&quot; in his youth, Hull stated in his autobiography that he was not surprised when he failed to attract the attention of a junior team. He was first eligible for the NHL Entry Draft in 1982, but as he was still playing in a juvenile league, was passed over without interest. He joined the Penticton Knights of the tier-II British Columbia Junior Hockey League (BCJHL) in the 1982–83 season where he scored 48 goals in 50 games. He was again passed over at the 1983 Entry Draft as teams remained unconvinced of his commitment to the game and his conditioning. NHL teams finally took notice of Hull following his 1983–84 season in which he scored 105 goals in 56 games and broke the BCJHL scoring record with 188 points. The Calgary Flames selected him in the sixth round of the 1984 NHL Entry Draft, 117th overall.

Hull accepted a scholarship to play for the University of Minnesota-Duluth (UMD), and in 1984–85, scored 32 goals as a freshman. The power of his shot terrorized goaltenders. He was awarded the Jerry Chumola Award as the school&#x27;s rookie of the year and received similar honors from the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). His coaches at Minnesota-Duluth impressed on Hull the need to improve his skating, and in 1985–86, he broke the school record of 49 goals in one season, reaching 52 that year. Hull was named the WCHA first-team all-star at right wing and was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award as the top player in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

In his two seasons at UMD, Hull set numerous school scoring records. He holds the records for most goals by a rookie (32) and most goals in one season (52). His 20 power play goals, seven hat tricks, and 13 multiple-goal games in 1985–86 are all records, and he shares the school&#x27;s single-game playoff record of four goals. The school retired his jersey number 29 in 2006.

===Calgary Flames (1986–88)===
Choosing to turn professional following his sophomore season, Hull signed a contract with the Calgary Flames and joined the team during the 1986 Stanley Cup Playoffs. He made his NHL debut on May 20, 1986, in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Montreal Canadiens. His best scoring opportunity came when he hit the post in his first shift of the game. He appeared in two games of the Flames&#x27; five-game series loss to Montreal.

The Flames assigned Hull to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Moncton Golden Flames, for the majority of the 1986–87 season. He scored 50 goals, tying an AHL rookie record, and his 93 points was third-best in the league. He won the Dudley &quot;Red&quot; Garrett Memorial Award as the league&#x27;s Rookie of the Year and was named to the First All-Star Team, earning a brief recall to Calgary during the season. He made his regular-season debut on November 13, 1986, against the Hartford Whalers and scored his first NHL goal against Steve Weeks on a breakaway. It was the game-winning goal in a 4–3 victory. Hull appeared in five regular-season games for the Flames and played in four playoff games, where he scored two goals and added an assist.

Hull earned a spot on the Flames for the 1987–88 season, though the team continued to work with him on his conditioning. He appeared in 52 games for the Flames, scoring 26 goals and 50 points. He did not finish the season in Calgary, however. On March 7, 1988, Hull was traded with Steve Bozek to the St. Louis Blues for defenseman Rob Ramage and goaltender Rick Wamsley.

===St. Louis Blues (1988–98)===

Hull led St. Louis with 41 goals in , but his poor skating and inattention to his defensive responsibilities concerned the club. Head coach Brian Sutter convinced Hull to improve his conditioning over the summer. He arrived to begin the season in much better shape and showed a marked improvement in his skating. Center Adam Oates, acquired over the summer, joined Hull on the top line. The pair, dubbed &quot;Hull and Oates&quot; as a play on the band Hall and Oates, were prolific scorers with Oates being an excellent passer and Hull being an excellent shooter. Hull scored 228 goals between 1989–90 and , the second-highest three-season total of any player in NHL history, behind only Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 250 tallies between and . He became the fifth player in NHL history to score 50 goals in 50 games in ,—joining Maurice Richard, Mike Bossy, Gretzky, and Mario Lemieux—then repeated the feat in 1991–92.

He led the league in goal scoring all three seasons and was named to the first All-Star team each year. He collected numerous league awards, winning the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy in 1990 as the league&#x27;s most sportsmanlike player, then in 1991, won the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson Award as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player as selected by the league and his fellow players respectively. His total of 86 goals in 1990–91 is the third highest for a single season in NHL history, after Gretzky&#x27;s 92 goals in 1981–82 and 87 in 1983–84. Oates left the Blues midway through the 1991–92 season, and while Hull&#x27;s offensive production dropped, he remained the Blues&#x27; top offensive threat. He recorded his fourth and fifth consecutive 50-goal seasons, scoring 54 in and 57 in .

Hull clashed with head coach Mike Keenan, who joined the team in , primarily over the latter&#x27;s changes to team personnel. Hull, who had been named team captain in 1992, was stripped of the captaincy. By early 1996, the two were publicly criticizing each other in the media. Forced to choose between the player and coach, the Blues fired Keenan on December 19, 1996. Hull responded three nights later with a hat trick against the Los Angeles Kings to reach 500 goals for his NHL career. He and Bobby are the only father-son pair who both reached that total.

After 43- and 42-goal seasons in and , Hull scored 27 in . He became an unrestricted free agent following the season after rejecting a three-year, $15 million offer from the Blues because the team refused to include a no-trade clause. He left St. Louis, signing a three-year, $17 million contract with the Dallas Stars on July 2, 1998.

===Dallas Stars (1998–2001)===
Hull reached 1,000 points in his career when he notched a goal and an assist in a 3–1 victory with the Dallas Stars over the Boston Bruins on November 14, 1998. He then scored his 600th goal on December 31, 1999, in a 5–4 victory over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He scored 32 goals in 1998–99 despite struggling with a groin injury for much of the season. The Stars reached the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals, against the Buffalo Sabres. The sixth game of the series went to overtime tied 1–1 while Dallas held a 3–2 series lead. At 14:51 of the third overtime period, Hull collected a rebound in front of the Buffalo net and put the puck past goaltender Dominik Hašek to win the game, and the Stanley Cup, for Dallas.
The Sabres immediately protested the goal, as NHL rules of the time stated that a player could not score a goal if any part of his body was within the goal crease. Replays showed that Hull&#x27;s skate was within the crease when he scored, however, the NHL ruled that he had possession of the puck prior to entering the crease, making the goal legal. League officials stated that that very scenario was addressed in a memo sent to the league&#x27;s on-ice officials prior to the start of the playoffs. Hull himself states the goal was legal, supporting the claim that the NHL had altered the rules in a private memo sent to all teams but not released to the public. Media, fans and players across the league remain divided on the goal, some claiming that the league altered the rule after the fact. It remains especially controversial in Buffalo, where fans and former players continue to maintain that the play should have been ruled &quot;no goal&quot;. The NHL formally abolished the crease rule prior to the next season, allowing players to score from within the crease freely as long as they did not interfere with the goaltender.

As a member of the Stars in their Stanley Cup winning season, Hull wore number 22, as his customary number 16 was worn by Pat Verbeek. Hull switched back to number 16 the following season after Verbeek left the team as a free agent. Though he appeared in 79 games in 1999–2000, Hull had what coach Ken Hitchcock called &quot;a disappointing season&quot;, struggling defensively and scoring only 24 goals. His offensive production improved in the 2000 Stanley Cup Playoffs as he led the league in post-season scoring with 10 goals and 23 points. The Stars again reached the finals, but lost the series in six games to the New Jersey Devils. Hull scored 39 goals in 2000–01, his best total in four years. He surpassed his father&#x27;s career total when he scored his 611th goal in a 3–1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 10, 2000. Hull played his 1,000th career game on February 25, 2001, in Calgary.

===Detroit Red Wings (2001–04)===
The Stars did not exercise their option on Hull&#x27;s contract that would have paid him $7 million for the 2001–02 NHL season, making him a free agent. Although he received superior financial offers from the Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers, Hull signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Detroit Red Wings to pursue a second Stanley Cup championship. He joined an already star-studded team that earlier that offseason had acquired goaltender Dominik Hasek and winger Luc Robitaille.

As a member of the Red Wings, Hull switched to sweater number 17 out of respect for Vladimir Konstantinov, who wore number 16 for the Red Wings before his playing career ended due to a limousine accident a week after Detroit&#x27;s 1997 Stanley Cup championship. As of 2023, no player has worn the number 16 for the Red Wings since Konstantinov.

Hull subsequently scored 30 goals that season as the Red Wings dominated their opponents, earning the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top team. During the regular season, he was put on a line with Boyd Devereaux and rookie Pavel Datsyuk, a combination in which Hull himself referred to as &quot;two kids and a goat&quot;.

Hull would then score a league-leading 10 in the 2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs, as the Red Wings defeated the Vancouver Canucks, his former team the St. Louis Blues, and the rival Colorado Avalanche en route to their fourth Finals appearance in eight years. He had a hat trick in the deciding sixth game in the opening round against Vancouver, while adding two goals in the second round against the Blues. He then scored three goals in the Western Conference Finals against the Avalanche, including one in Detroit&#x27;s stunning 7–0 rout of Colorado in the decisive Game 7.

He scored key goals in Detroit&#x27;s game three and four victories against the Carolina Hurricanes in the Stanley Cup Finals; the latter was the 100th playoff goal of his career. Hull won his second career championship as the Red Wings won the series in five games.

Hull posted a 37-goal, 76-point campaign in 2002–03. He became the sixth player in NHL history to score 700 career goals on February 10, 2003, against the San Jose Sharks. At age 38, Hull signed a one-year, $5 million extension with the Red Wings. After scoring 25 goals in 2003–04, Hull would score three goals during the 2004 Stanley Cup Playoffs for Detroit, who were eliminated by the eventual Western Conference champion Calgary Flames in six games in the second round.

===Phoenix Coyotes (2004–05)===
The Stars thought they were on the verge of signing Hull to a one-year contract for 2004–05, but he instead accepted a two-year, $4.5 million contract with the Phoenix Coyotes. The first year of the contract was wiped out when the season was cancelled due to a labor stoppage. When play resumed in 2005–06, Hull returned to the ice wearing his father&#x27;s jersey number 9. The Coyotes franchise, which had relocated from Winnipeg in 1996, continued to honor the Jets&#x27; retired numbers, including the elder Hull&#x27;s. Bobby requested that the team un-retire his number and allow his son to wear it. However, after playing just five games and recording one assist, Hull felt that he was no longer able to play at the level he expected of himself. On October 15, 2005, he announced his retirement as a player.

==International play==
As a dual Canadian and American citizen, Hull was eligible to play for either country internationally. While playing at UMD, he was passed over by Team Canada coach Dave King when selecting the roster for the 1986 World Ice Hockey Championships. However, American national team coach Dave Peterson invited him to join their squad. Hull accepted and led the team in scoring with 7 goals and 11 points for the sixth place Americans. Hull later said the faith shown in him by American officials gave him the confidence to excel in his career. He played with Team USA for the rest of his career, and at the 1986 Calgary Cup tournament, played a pivotal role in a 5–3 upset of Canada by the Americans. Following the game, he said &quot;I don&#x27;t feel more like an American than a Canadian. I just want to play.&quot;

Hull tied Mike Modano for the American scoring lead at the 1991 Canada Cup with nine points. He led the Americans into the tournament final against Canada, but was held pointless in the decisive game as Canada won the tournament with a 4–2 game. Canadian fans turned on Hull at the inaugural World Cup of Hockey in 1996. In the semifinal against Russia, fans in Ottawa loudly booed Hull and chanted &quot;traitor&quot; towards him as he scored two goals to lead the United States to the final against Canada. In the deciding game of the best-of-three final, Hull scored a key goal as the Americans turned a 2–1 deficit with five minutes to play into a 5–2 victory and captured the championship. Hull led all players with 11 points and was a tournament all-star at forward.

Making his Olympic debut at the 1998 Winter Games, Hull scored two goals in four games. The Americans were quickly eliminated from the tournament and were criticized for their lack of desire and leadership. The team was further embarrassed when it was discovered some members had trashed their hotel room following their elimination. Hull was initially blamed as being a culprit. He angrily denied the accusation and claimed it was an invention of Canadian media upset that he was playing for the United States. Hull, Modano and John LeClair formed the American&#x27;s top line for the 2002 Olympics. The trio were dominant throughout most of the tournament, leading Team USA to the gold medal game against Canada. Hull and LeClair finished second and third in overall scoring, respectively; however they were held pointless against Team Canada in the final. Hull and the Americans settled for the silver medal following a 5–2 defeat.

Team USA named Hull an alternate captain of its veteran-laden team for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. However, he was benched by head coach Ron Wilson following two indifferent games in which he did not register a point and never returned to the active lineup.

==Playing style==
Upon his arrival in the NHL, Hull was considered a &quot;one-dimensional player&quot;. He was a natural goal scorer with a reputation for being uninterested in backchecking and playing defense. He was nicknamed &quot;The Incredible Hull&quot; (a reference to Bruce Banner) in college for his scoring exploits and was called &quot;The Golden Brett&quot; in the NHL, a play on his father&#x27;s nickname of &quot;The Golden Jet&quot;. Hull was often compared to Bobby in his early years, though the two shared few similarities on the ice. Both were known for their shooting ability, particularly the power of their slapshot, which Terry Crisp — who played against Bobby and coached Brett — described as &quot;explosive&quot;, but while Bobby was a left wing known for both his conditioning and skating ability, Hull played right wing, was a poorer skater and lacked his father&#x27;s physique.

His reputation for defensive indifference persisted through much of his career. In his 72-goal season of 1989–90, Hull&#x27;s plus-minus (net difference of even strength and shorthanded goals scored for and against while he was on the ice) was −1. He was a −27 four years later despite scoring 54 goals. Hull also carried a reputation as a player who could not win as his Blues&#x27; teams rarely achieved success in the playoffs. He shed that reputation after leading his teams to championships at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey and the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals. To win that 1999 championship, Hull also had to fit in with the Dallas Stars&#x27; defense-oriented system. He finished that season with a career-best plus-minus of +19.

Known as an outspoken player, Hull earned a reputation on and off the ice for speaking bluntly and without regard for whom it might offend. He chastised his own fans in 1992 — later backtracking — when they booed Adam Oates following Oates&#x27; trade request, calling them &quot;losers&quot; and stating he wanted to rip one particular fan&#x27;s head off. Hull was a consistent critic of the NHL&#x27;s defensive, &quot;clutch and grab&quot; era of the late 1990s, raising the ire of commissioner Gary Bettman in 1998 when he said &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t pay to watch. It&#x27;s boring. The whole style of the game is terrible. There&#x27;s no flow. When a guy like [Mario] Lemieux leaves the game and tells you why he&#x27;s leaving, and you don&#x27;t address it, that&#x27;s stupid. But the players don&#x27;t say crap. That&#x27;s why I always look like the big mouth.&quot;

Hull played in eight NHL All-Star Games, and was named the most valuable player of the 1992 game in Philadelphia. As of 2022, his 741 career goals is the fifth highest total in NHL history, and Hull was the third-fastest (behind Wayne Gretzky and Alex Ovechkin) to reach 700 goals, doing so in 1,157 games. He is also second all-time in power play goals with 265 and third in game-winning goals with 110. With 24 career game-winning playoff goals, he is tied with Gretzky for the most all-time. He scored 33 hat tricks in his career, the fourth highest in NHL history. Hull holds numerous St. Louis Blues franchise records, including goals (527), power play goals (195), game-winning goals (70) and hat tricks (27). He also holds the organization&#x27;s single-season records of goals (86) and points (131). In honor of his achievements with the team, the Blues retired his jersey number 16 in 2006. The team also arranged to have a portion of the street that runs alongside the Enterprise Center renamed &quot;Brett Hull Way&quot;. In 2010, the team unveiled a statue of him in front of the arena. Hull was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2008, and into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Management career==
Hull worked two jobs in 2006–07. He served as a special assistant to the team president of the Dallas Stars and provided studio analysis for NHL on NBC telecasts. He left NBC after one season when he was named a special adviser to the team&#x27;s hockey operations department. Hull was promoted to interim co-general manager of the Stars, sharing the role with Les Jackson after Doug Armstrong was fired on November 13, 2007. ESPN analyst Scott Burnside criticized the promotion of Hull, noting his lack of front office experience and questionable work ethic.

The pair made one of the most prominent trades in the 2007–08 NHL season, acquiring Brad Richards from the Tampa Bay Lightning as part of a five-player trade. The team went on to reach the Western Conference Final of the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Stars&#x27; deepest playoff run in eight years. Team owner Tom Hicks rewarded the pair with three-year contracts and named them permanent co-general managers. He credited Hull for his positive relationship with the players and his &quot;unconventional wisdom&quot;.

The signing of controversial forward Sean Avery prior to the 2008–09 season proved a turning point for Hull and Jackson. Avery&#x27;s erratic behavior created divisions within the team&#x27;s locker room, particularly after he made derogatory comments towards another player&#x27;s girlfriend in the media. The Stars missed the playoffs that season, leading the team to replace Hull and Jackson as general manager with Joe Nieuwendyk. Hull remained with the organization, serving as an adviser to Hicks and team president Jeff Cogen. Hull has since been hired by the St. Louis Blues as their executive vice president for business development.

On May 21, 2019, after the Blues advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 49 years, Hull was not able to control his emotions and cried, saying &quot;I&#x27;m in there. I&#x27;m not a crier, but I&#x27;m crying...I saw Bobby Plager and I&#x27;m like &#x27;Holy cow,&#x27;... 49 years in the making for this... These guys have played unbelievable.&quot;

On Saturday, June 15, 2019, after the St. Louis Blues won their first Stanley Cup, Hull took the stage and led the crowd in a drunken ramble that echoed throughout the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial following the victory parade down Market Street. He coined the phrase, &quot;We went Blues,&quot; explaining, &quot;We don&#x27;t have to go anymore, &#x27;cause we already did it.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hull lived in Dallas, Texas, with his second wife, Darcie. He has three children by his first wife, Alison: son Jude and daughters Jayde and Crosby. Jude also played hockey as a goaltender. He attended St. Olaf College until 2018, but has never played professionally. Jayde attended Colgate University.

In business, Hull was twice involved in the operation of restaurants. He owned two eateries in St. Louis while he was a member of the Blues, and partnered with Mike Modano and others on a Dallas restaurant called &quot;Hully and Mo Restaurant and Tap Room&quot; following his playing career. He lent his name to a 1995 Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game called &quot;Brett Hull Hockey&quot;. Hull was a co-owner of the St. Louis Bandits, a junior team in the North American Hockey League. In November 2020, Hull returned to restaurant operation in the St. Louis area with the opening of Brett Hull&#x27;s Junction in Wentzville, Missouri.

Hull is an avid golfer, often stating during his career that he preferred the sport to hockey. He was a frequent participant in the American Century Celebrity Golf Classic and his best finish at the tournament was a tie for fifth in 2008. He competes in several charity and celebrity tournaments, and in 2009 was ranked as the sixth best athlete golfer in North America by &quot;Golf Digest&quot;.

==In other media==
Hull was a guest on the Weekend Update segment of the December 11, 2004, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Hull made a special guest appearance as the USA hockey team captain in the &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot; episode, &quot;Diamonds Are a Ghoul&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;.

<text>Robert Howard Marris (born 8 April 1955) is a British Labour Party politician, who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wolverhampton South West. He first held the seat from 2001 until his defeat in 2010. He regained at the seat at the 2015 general election, but stepped down at the 2017 general election.

== Early life and career ==

The son of Dr. Charles Marris and Margaret Marris JP, he was born in Wolverhampton and partially educated at Warstones Primary School, before attending Birchfield Preparatory School and St. Edward&#x27;s School in Oxford.

He then moved to Canada and spent some time as a lumberjack, before obtaining a double first in History and Sociology from the University of British Columbia. 
He then completed a master&#x27;s degree, working as a truck driver whilst finishing his thesis.

Having decided he wanted a career in law in the UK and not being eligible for a UK grant, he spent 3 years driving trolleybuses, followed by a period as a forest fire fighter during which time he joined Greenpeace, newly founded in Vancouver, becoming world member no. 204. He was also a member of the New Democratic Party, Canada&#x27;s counterpart to the Labour Party as members of the Socialist International.

He served his articles of clerkship in Wolverhampton and went to work for Thompsons Solicitors, the trade union law firm, until he was elected to the House of Commons.

== Parliamentary career ==

=== 2001–10 ===

First elected at the 2001 general election, on 8 July 2007, he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Shaun Woodward, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

In July 2008, Marris received the &quot;Backbencher of the Year&quot; award from &quot;The House&quot;, the magazine of the House of Commons. Marris spoke in a &quot;well above average&quot; number of parliamentary debates and had a &quot;well above average&quot; voting record.

Marris emerged well from the May 2009 political scandal of MPs expenses disclosures being listed as a &quot;saint&quot;, with minimal claims for second home. However, he was defeated in the 2010 general election by Paul Uppal of the Conservative Party.

=== 2015–17 ===

In May 2013, Marris was once again selected as the Labour Party&#x27;s Parliamentary candidate for Wolverhampton South West in the 2015 General Election. The seat was once held by the Conservative Enoch Powell, known for his April 1968 &quot;rivers of blood&quot; speech in which he opposed immigration. In the run-up to the 2015 election, both Marris, his main opponent, Paul Uppal and even UKIP agreed that immigration was no longer a key issue. Marris expressed concern about zero hour contracts, foodbanks and workers earnings below living wages and whilst Uppal highlighted the improvement in community relations.

In 2015, Marris introduced the Assisted Dying Bill, based on Lord Falconer of Thoroton&#x27;s earlier proposals in the House of Lords. The bill was praised by Philip Collins, a leader writer for &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;a sophisticated and humane attempt&quot; to clarify the law before the courts do so and which unlike religion &quot;will actually ease suffering.&quot; Archbishop Welby&#x27;s subsequent objections were described as &quot;histrionic&quot; and lacking any religious reason. 
According to Linda Woodhead, professor of sociology of religion at Lancaster University, 70 per cent of religious people wanted the law changed. The bill was rejected by 330 to 118.

A marginal at the 2015 general election, Marris regained Wolverhampton South West with a majority of 801 votes. He was appointed Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury by Jeremy Corbyn in September 2015.

On 30 June 2016, Marris resigned during the committee stage hearings on the Finance Bill and reportedly called on Corbyn to resign along with a number of Parliamentary colleagues preceding the 2016 leadership election. During the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, a video emerged of candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey, who at the time of the ultimately unsuccessful 2016 leadership challenge had been in post as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury for 3 days, accusing Marris of having his assistant delete shared Shadow Cabinet files after resigning in an attempt to undermine loyalist frontbenchers. Marris strongly denied there was any malicious intent and said that his assistant deleted the files because the document was created by his Parliamentary office and was not the property of the Labour Party. In an interview Marris clarified that it was him who removed the shared files, not his assistant.

Marris stood down at the 2017 general election, which Labour was expected to lose badly. His successor, Eleanor Smith, held the seat for Labour with an increased majority of 2,185.

== Personal life ==

In June 2008, Marris was cautioned after causing damage, which he said was unintentional, to a van which was impeding his access to a bus stop. He is Honorary President of the Wolves on Wheels Cycle Campaign.

After leaving Parliament, Marris was appointed Board Director for B E Wedge Holdings Ltd, the holding company for Wedge Group Galvanizing.

<text>Gordon Marsden (born 28 November 1953) is a British Labour Party politician who served as Member of Parliament for Blackpool South from 1997 to 2019.

==Early life==
Marsden was educated at Stockport Grammar School, an independent school in Stockport, Cheshire, followed by New College, Oxford, where he was awarded a first-class degree in Modern History. He then went on to postgraduate studies at the Warburg Institute (part of the University of London) and Harvard Kennedy School, being a Kennedy Scholar in Politics and International Relations.

Before entering Parliament he had been a tutor for the Open University since 1994, as well as a public affairs adviser to English Heritage and, for twelve years, the editor of &quot;History Today&quot; and &quot;New Socialist&quot; magazine.

==Parliamentary career==
Marsden first contested the seat of Blackpool South in 1992 and won it in 1997. Once elected to Parliament, he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Irvine of Lairg in the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department (2001–03), Tessa Jowell as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (2003–05) and John Denham as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and shadow communities secretary (2009–10).

In 2003, he was made a Visiting Parliamentary Fellow of St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford.

He sat as a member of the House of Commons Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee and Education and Skills Select Committee, until it was dissolved in 2007.

In May 2010, Marsden was given his first shadow ministerial brief, by acting leader Harriet Harman, as Shadow Minister for Further Education, Skills and Regional Growth. He remained in post following Ed Miliband&#x27;s election as Labour leader, but was appointed as a Shadow Minister for Transport in the October 2013 Labour frontbench reshuffle.

Gordon Marsden was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015.

Following Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s election as Labour leader in September 2015, Marsden readopted his former Further Education and Skills briefs as Shadow Minister for Higher Education, Further Education and Skills. In his new position, he succeeded Shadow Universities Minister Liam Byrne and Shadow Further Education and Skills Minister Yvonne Fovargue.

He was Chair of the Associate Parliamentary Skills Group and of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Veterans.

==Fabian Society==
Marsden is a member of the Fabian Society, of which he was the Chair from 2000 to 2001. He also served as Chair of the Young Fabians and now serves as a Trustee of Dartmouth Street, the building where the Society is based.

==Seaside towns==
Marsden convened the first group of Labour MPs representing seaside and coastal towns. In 2007, Marsden was asked to chair a Manifesto Group for the Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Seaside and Coastal Towns.

==Personal life==

Marsden is gay. In early 2009, Gordon was named as one of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&#x27;s&quot; expenses &quot;saints&quot;, due to the low levels of his expenses claims.

<text>Paul William Barry Marsden (born 18 March 1968) is a British writer, businessman and former politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Shrewsbury and Atcham from 1997 until 2005. He was most prominently known for his anti-war views and crossing the floor twice (the first to do so since Winston Churchill), from Labour to the Liberal Democrats in 2001 and returning to Labour in 2005. He instructed a solicitor in 2010 to begin action for phone hacking that allegedly took place back in 2003 by a newspaper. In 2012, Marsden was appointed to draft the parliamentary inquiry report into VIP security at the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London. Marsden is currently Head of Quality for the Transpennine Route Upgrade West rail alliance, improving the railway between Manchester and Leeds.

== Early life ==
Marsden was born in Frodsham in Cheshire to Thomas Darlington Marsden, a distribution manager and Labour councillor and Audrey Stott, a school teacher. He was educated at Helsby High School. Marsden completed a diploma in building studies at Mid-Cheshire College in 1986, but withdrew from completing a civil engineering degree after the first three years at Teesside Polytechnic in 1990. Studying part-time, he passed a diploma in management at the Open University and a diploma in business excellence at Newcastle College.

Before his political career, Marsden worked as a quality manager at Taylor Woodrow (1990–1994), a management consultant at NatWest Bank (1994–1996) and as a total quality facilitator at Mitel from 1996 until the general election in 1997.

== Labour Member of Parliament ==
Marsden was elected as the first (and thus far only) Labour MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham at the 1997 general election with a swing of 11.4%; a seat which he held at the 2001 election with a further swing of 5.5%. At 29 years of age, he was one of the youngest MPs elected in 1997. He spoke in the Commons for the first time on 21 May 1997 and in an otherwise traditional maiden speech, joked prophetically about refusing to be intimidated by the Whips. He was nominated to serve on the Agriculture Select Committee and remained for four years quietly serving on the committee.

On 14 April 1999, Marsden introduced the Cancer Care Bill with backing from cancer charities including Macmillan Cancer Support, under the Ten Minute Rule that would create the first comprehensive directory of cancer services in the UK to aid patients in identifying the location and type of cancer care available. The Bill prompted Ruth Fermor Allan to create such a directory called &quot;Cancer Care 2000&quot;, which was published by Cambridge Healthcare Publishing Ltd in November 2000.

In March 2001, Marsden with cross party support put forward a Doorstep Recycling Bill, mandating the collection of recyclable materials from streets. The Bill was backed by Friends of the Earth. The Bill did not succeed that year but the Government eventually backed a similar Bill by Joan Ruddock and the Municipal Waste Recycling Bill was passed in October 2003, increasing the levels of recycling of residential waste.

After a first term loyally supporting the Government, Marsden began to question the Labour Government&#x27;s foreign policy following 9/11. On 8 October 2001, he was the first MP in the Commons to publicly call for a vote on any military action in Afghanistan. Marsden took to sitting in Tony Benn&#x27;s former Commons seat below the gangway on the second row from the back. Two weeks later, Marsden was instructed to attend a meeting with the Labour Chief Whip, Hilary Armstrong. As Jeremy Paxman wrote, &quot;the Labour MP Paul Marsden took the unprecedented step of recording the dressing-down&quot;, where he said that he had been confronted with accusations that &quot;those aren&#x27;t with us are against us,&quot; &quot;war is not a matter of conscience&quot; and &quot;it was people like you who appeased Hitler in 1938&quot;, infuriating Marsden to going public.

Tony Benn described in his diary that &quot;The pressure on the anti-war MPs is growing. Apparently Paul Marsden had three-quarters-of-an-hour being bullied by the Chief Whip, Hilary Armstrong.&quot;
Number 10 were forced to put out a statement that dissenting backbenchers would be allowed to speak out on the war. &quot;The Guardian&quot; in its Leader praised Marsden for having called for a vote on the war and publishing the Chief Whip&#x27;s response to it and stated, &quot;On both counts he has done British democracy a service.&quot;

Undeterred by the Whip&#x27;s criticism, Marsden then spoke out against the press officer Jo Moore who had said, that 9/11 was &quot;a very good day to get out anything we want to bury&quot;; he and Tam Dalyell were the only two Labour MPs to vote against the Government.

In November 2001, Marsden visited Pakistan and the Afghan border to highlight the plight of Afghan refugees living in camps who had fled the war. Marsden also negotiated the release of &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; journalist Christina Lamb and photographer Justin Sutcliffe, who had been arrested and held by the Pakistan Police and Inter-Services Intelligence secret service. Christina Lamb thanked Marsden in the acknowledgements of her biographical book, &quot;The Sewing Circles of Herat&quot;, &quot;Paul Marsden MP for Shrewsbury, helped rescue us from the ISI, being manhandled by Baluchistan police in the process, and kindly rearranged his whole schedule to stay in Pakistan until we were safely out.&quot;

On 18 November 2001, Marsden was one of the leaders of the Stop the War demonstration against the war in Afghanistan in London. Marsden was one of the principal speakers along with Tony Benn and George Galloway in Trafalgar Square with 100,000 protesters. He accused Blair of being &quot;drunk with power&quot; and &quot;we are not simply going to allow the atrocities of September 11 to be replaced with further atrocities in Afghanistan&quot;.

Marsden complained bitterly that he had been subjected to late night physical attacks by some Labour Whips, which were vigorously denied. Five days later, he defected to the Liberal Democrats on 10 December 2001, citing his disagreements with Labour whips over his opposition to military action in Afghanistan and the resulting civilian casualties. The &quot;Big Issue&quot; magazine&#x27;s readers voted Marsden &#x27;Hero of the Year&#x27; in 2001 for his opposition to the war in Afghanistan.

== Liberal Democrat MP and spokesperson ==
In May 2002, Marsden was promoted to junior Health spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats reporting to Evan Harris, in charge of a portfolio covering mental health, prison health and aspects of cancer care.

In June 2002, Marsden presented the Prescriptions (Chronic Diseases) Bill, which aimed to introduce a fairer system for issuing prescriptions&#x27; exemptions for patients with acute conditions. Although the Bill received cross party support it ran out of parliamentary time before the summer recess. The Bill received backing from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and the National Asthma Campaign.

In August 2002 he visited Malawi to turn the media spotlight on the southern African famine and later he travelled to Johannesburg to lobby the United Nations conference discussing the famine affecting Southern Africa. His accusations that the failures of the International Monetary Fund had exacerbated the famine caused a public argument with the IMF Director.

In February 2003, prior to the Iraq War, he visited the USA to give a speaking tour opposing the impending war and laid a Union flag and wreath in commemoration of the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks at Ground Zero. He also attended the United Nations Security Council session considering the looming war on 14 February. Marsden strongly opposed the war in Iraq and repeatedly voted for an inquiry into the alleged intelligence failings and concerns that parliament was misled.

On the second anniversary of 9/11, he visited the Slobodan Milosevic trial in The Hague and met with prosecution lawyers at the International Criminal Court.

Marsden was declared the leading rebel on all parliamentary votes by &quot;The Times&quot; in 2003.

In October 2003, Marsden was appointed the number two behind John Thurso as Transport spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats and nominated as a member of the Transport Select Committee.

In April 2004, Marsden set the fifth fastest time for MPs completing the London Marathon out of forty two that have taken part since it began in 1981, with a time of 3 hours 18 minutes 1 second.

On 26 August 2004, Marsden became one of only twenty cross party MPs to back the Impeach Blair campaign with the aim of holding Blair to account over the highly controversial war in Iraq. The campaign used legal counsel for advice but was unable to secure enough support for progressing the impeachment in parliament.

== Announces retirement as MP and rejoins Labour ==
In July 2004 Marsden announced that he was retiring from politics and would not contest the May 2005 general election. He cited the toll suffered as a result of admissions about his private life and the effects on his family. He reduced his Liberal Democrat political duties and on 5 April 2005, within hours of the start of the election campaign, Marsden announced his intention to rejoin the Labour Party, stating that although he still disagreed with the government over the war and levels of investment in public services, he did not want Labour MPs, who shared his views, to lose their seats. He later apologised to Liberal Democrat supporters for leaving the party. He was the first British politician since Winston Churchill to re-cross the floor of the House of Commons and return to his original party, in Marsden&#x27;s case to sit on the Labour benches.

During his Parliamentary career Marsden raised over £10K for local and international charities through sponsored marathon running, abseiling and swimming.

In the 2005 general election the Conservative, Daniel Kawczynski won back the Shrewsbury and Atcham seat from the subsequent Labour candidate, Michael Ion.

== Expenses ==
Although MPs expenses were published after Marsden had left parliament, expenses claims were backdated to the time when he was a sitting MP. Sir Thomas Legg gave Marsden a clean bill of health and reported that he was one of only a minority of MPs and ex-MPs with &quot;no issues&quot;.

== Post-Parliamentary career ==
In December 2005, Marsden caused a row when he publicly confirmed Charles Kennedy&#x27;s drinking problems and that Kennedy had not been telling the truth about his illness. Kennedy&#x27;s press secretary vehemently denied Marsden&#x27;s story. However, by 5 January 2006, Kennedy admitted he had &quot;a drink problem&quot; and had sought &quot;professional help&quot;. He resigned two days later as leader.

In 2007, Marsden was appointed Director of Policy at the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection and between 2008 and 2010 was the CEO of the Painting and Decorating Association.

In May 2009, Marsden applied to rejoin the Labour Party but was provisionally blocked by the National Executive and is not presently a member of any political party.

In 2010, Marsden returned to business consultancy, working as a consultant for a trade conference.

In January 2011, it was reported that Marsden had commenced legal enquiries into allegations of hacking into his phone back in 2003. A suspended reporter who worked at the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; and then the &quot;News of the World&quot; was claimed to be involved. A Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme interviewed Marsden and it was revealed that the reporter in question, had been suspended for phone hacking, although he denied it.

In May 2011, Marsden wrote on his Blog, www.paulwbmarsden.blogspot.com, an article about the debate on public interest vs privacy in which he mentioned the allegations that Ryan Giggs was the footballer who had taken out a super injunction against Imogen Thomas. His Blog was written before John Hemming revealed the Manchester United player&#x27;s name under parliamentary privilege.

In 2019 Marsden joined BAM Nuttall and the TransPennine Route Upgrade Alliance as Head of Quality.

==Author==
Prior to retiring from politics, Marsden co-authored the book &quot;Voices for Peace&quot; published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 2001. Four years later, he researched and published a local history book, &quot;The Blackfriars of Shrewsbury&quot; after leaving parliament.

In September 2010, Marsden&#x27;s war poem, &quot;Eighty at Ligny&quot; was used in l&#x27;exposition historique for the British World War I war cemetery in memory of the eighty British, Irish and Canadian soldiers who are buried in Ligny-sur-Canche. 

In July 2012, Marsden was appointed as a consultant to the All Party Parliamentary Group on Specialist Security and was employed to draft the inquiry report on VIP Security at the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London.

Routledge published a technical book by Marsden, &quot;Digital Quality Management in Construction&quot;.

Marsden researched and addressed the views of famous writers of the 19th century on Britain and France in his 650 page book, &quot;Entente Cordiale of 20 Great Writers in the 19th Century&quot;.

In April 2024, Marsden was a co-winner of &quot;The Letter Review&quot; Nonfiction Prize for his essay, &quot;Slipped Disc&quot; about his year long suffering after a herniated disc. 

Marsden published a scathing letter in &quot;The Guardian&quot; about the reduction in pensioners eligible for the Winter Fuel Payment, accusing Keir Starmer’s Labour Party of replicating Blair’s ‘New Jerusalem’ Labour with disability cuts in 1997.

<doc id="434919" wikidata="Q583946" url="?curid=434919" title="Alan Meale">
<text>Sir Joseph Alan Meale (born 31 July 1949) is a former British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Mansfield from 1987 to 2017.

==Early life==
Meale attended St Joseph RC School in Bishop Auckland and studied at Ruskin College (in Oxford), and Durham University, his CV also mentions Sheffield Hallam University.

Meale&#x27;s website lists his previous occupations as author, editor, development officer, trade union official, researcher, political adviser and journalist.

==Parliamentary career==
Meale entered Parliament on 11 June 1987 and made his maiden speech on 3 July 1987 in the Tourism debate where he commented on the poverty, lack of provision, opportunity and services in the Mansfield community.
Meale was a whip from 1992 to 1994 when he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to John Prescott in Prescott&#x27;s different portfolios until 1998.

Meale served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions under John Prescott from January 1998 to January 1999. He became a government whip Council of Europe Delegation in 2007 and acting Leader of the UK Delegation in 2010. He has been the chair of the British Section of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Cyprus Group since 2007.

In 1998, Michael Ancram accused Meale of &quot;cronyism&quot; following allegations in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that he had lobbied on behalf of Anthony Kleanthous, the millionaire Greek-Cypriot chairman of Barnet football club. Kleanthous wanted to build a £14 million stadium on green belt land, 140 miles from Meale&#x27;s constituency. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; article said that Britain&#x27;s Greek-Cypriot lobbying groups had paid for Meale and his wife to go to Cyprus and donated thousands of pounds to Labour. Meale denied cronyism, whilst Kleanthos insisted he had not donated to the Labour party and said it was &quot;a bit racist&quot; to link his business interests to Greek-Cypriot political lobbying efforts based on his ethnicity.

Meale was Vice Chair of the APPG for Cyprus, and was regarded by Greek Cypriot groups as one of their &quot;oldest and closest friends in Parliament&quot;. According to Meale, he first became interested in the political situation in Cyprus back in 1987 when Tony Benn advised him to &quot;pick a political issue and stick with it&quot;.

In the run-up to the UK referendum on membership of the European Union, Meale campaigned to remain in the EU.

===Expenses===
Meale was mentioned in the Parliamentary expenses scandal having claimed £13,000 over four years for gardening. The limit set retrospectively by Sir Thomas Legg was £1,000 /year. The Legg Report showed that Meale repaid £11,859.47.

===Alternative medicine===
Meale was one of sixteen MPs to sign an early day motion tabled by Conservative MP David Tredinnick regretting the British Medical Association&#x27;s opposition to further National Health Service funding of homoeopathy.

===Loss of seat===
Meale lost his seat at the 2017 general election when Ben Bradley overturned a 2015 Labour majority of 5,315 to become the first ever Conservative MP for the seat. Labour had held this seat since 1923 and the constituency had been represented by Meale since 1987 – before Bradley was born - making the latter one of the youngest MPs elected, despite the acting returning officer wrongly announcing Meale as the victor.

==Personal life==
Meale married Diana Gilhespy on 10 March 1983, his second wife; he has a son and daughter from his first marriage in 1970. Meale was knighted by Prince Charles officiating at the ceremony in January, 2012, after the 2011 Birthday Honours list was announced, chosen for his &quot;public and political service&quot;.

<text>In mathematics the finite Fourier transform may refer to either

*another name for discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of a finite-length series.  E.g., F.J.Harris (pp. 52–53) describes the &quot;finite Fourier transform&quot; as a &quot;continuous periodic function&quot; and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as &quot;a set of samples of the finite Fourier transform&quot;.  In actual implementation, that is not two separate steps; the DFT replaces the DTFT.  So J.Cooley (pp. 77–78) describes the implementation as &quot;discrete finite Fourier transform&quot;.

He then served in the British West Indies Regiment in France and the Middle East. After demobilisation he began organising concerts and toured the Caribbean as a vaudeville entertainer, singing calypso songs and performing comedy sketches.

In the early 1920s, he moved to Harlem, New York, where he performed and recorded music that combined jazz and calypso rhythms. In 1924 he recorded for the OKeh and Paramount record labels, and his music became popular with black American audiences as well as expatriate West Indians. He made his first Broadway appearance in 1925 in John Howard Lawson&#x27;s play, &quot;Processional&quot;. His song &quot;Lieutenant Julian&quot; commemorated the 1929 transatlantic flight by Trinidadian Hubert Fauntleroy Julian. Manning became increasingly associated with radical political causes. His companion was Amy Ashwood Garvey, who had been Marcus Garvey&#x27;s first wife. She produced &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, a jazz musical production at the Lafayette Theatre that featured Manning and Fats Waller and his band.

In 1934, he moved to England, where he gave performances in London. Manning was a member of the executive of the International African Friends of Ethiopia in 1935. He and Garvey opened the Florence Mills Social Club in London&#x27;s Carnaby Street, which quickly became a gathering spot for the city&#x27;s black intellectuals. 

Manning returned to New York City in 1941. That same year, he produced the only known calypso &quot;soundies&quot;. film clips made for film jukeboxes located in restaurants and bars. They featured Manning and his ensemble, and Trinidadian dance legend Beryl McBurnie. In 1947, Manning wrote and directed &quot;Caribbean Carnival&quot;, a Broadway show produced by Adolph Thenstead, which was billed as the &quot;First Calypso Musical Ever Presented&quot;. It was a lavish production, featuring 50 singers and dancers, among them New York-based calypsonian the Duke of Iron, Trinidadian dancer Pearl Primus and Manning himself. Manning and Thenstead also founded a record company, Cyclone.

Manning died in 1960 in Kumasi, Ghana, while travelling in Africa.

<text>The Emirate of Fujairah ( &quot;&quot; ) is one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, the only one of the seven with a coastline solely on the Gulf of Oman and none on the Persian Gulf. Its capital is Fujairah.

==History==
The Emirate of Fujairah, dominated by the &quot;Sharqiyin&quot; tribe, sits at the mouth of the important trade route, the &quot;Wadi Ham&quot; (which is guarded by the Sharqiyin Al Bithnah Fort), through the mountains to the interior and the Persian Gulf Coast. Known as the &quot;Shamaliyah&quot;, the east coast of what is now the UAE was subject to Muscat until 1850, when it was annexed by &quot;Al Qasimi&quot; of Sharjah, in an agreement made between Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi and the Sultan of Muscat. The Shamaliyah was governed by Al-Qasimi Wali at Kalba although frequently seceded and in 1901 Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Sharqi, chief of the Sharqiyin, declared independence from Sharjah. This was recognized by a number of the Trucial Sheikhs and also by Muscat, but not the British, who were frequently provoked by the independently minded Ruler. At this time, The Emirate of Fujairah consisted of some 150 houses and 3,000 date palms and its people lived mainly through pearling and date cultivation. Since the absorption of Kalba by Sharjah in 1952, the Shamaliyah is shared by the emirates of Fujairah and Sharjah.

In 1952, the Emirate of Fujairah entered into treaty relations with Britain, becoming the last of the emirates to join the Trucial States. Having withheld this recognition for over fifty years, the British government only granted it because the oil exploration company Petroleum Concessions Limited (PCL) needed to sign a concession with a recognized ruler. On 2 December 1971, The Emirate of Fujairah joined the United Arab Emirates.

Archaeological finds in the Emirate of Fujairah point to a history of human occupation and trading links stretching back at least 4,000 years, with Wadi Suq (2,000 to 1,300 BC) burials located at Bithnah and the Qidfa&#x27; Oasis. A third millennium BCE tower was used to construct the Portuguese fort at Bidiyah, identified with the Portuguese &#x27;Libedia&#x27;, a fortress recorded in de Resende&#x27;s 1646 map - the fortress itself has been carbon dated to 1450–1670.

The Emirate of Fujairah is also rich in late Islamic fortresses, as well as being home to the oldest mosque in use in the United Arab Emirates, Al Badiyah Mosque, which was built in 1446 of mud and bricks. It is similar to other mosques found in Yemen, eastern Oman, and Qatar. Al Badiyah Mosque has four domes (unlike the other similar mosques which have between seven and twelve) and lacks a minaret.

==Geography==
The Emirate of Fujairah covers approximately , or about 1.5% of the area of the UAE, and is the fifth-largest emirate in the UAE. 

The weather is seasonal, although it is warm most of the year. The months of December to March are generally the coolest, with daytime temperatures averaging around and rarely venturing above —with temperatures climbing to over degrees in the summer. The winter period also coincides with the rainy season and although by no means guaranteed, this is when the Emirate of Fujairah experiences the bulk of its precipitation. Rainfall is higher than the rest of the UAE, partly because of the effect of the mountains that encircle the Emirate, and partly because the prevailing winds are easterly bringing with them water-laden clouds off the warm Indian Ocean. The variability of the east coast climate is partly due to the presence of the Hajar mountain range. As with other mountainous areas, precipitation is higher, and this allows for a more varied micro-environment in the area. Tourist visitor numbers peak just before the school summer months.

==Demographics==

The Emirate of Fujairah had a population of 125,698 at the last census, held in 2005. Its population is around 225,360 inhabitants (in 2016); only the Emirate of Umm al-Quwain has fewer occupants. The 2019 population estimates is 256,256 inhabitants.

==Government==
The Emirate of Fujairah is an absolute monarchy ruled by its &quot;Hakim&quot;, Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi.

The Sheikh heads the cabinet of the Emirate of Fujairah, and a few members of respected local families in the emirate make up the advisory committees. The Sheikh must ratify any decisions by the cabinet. After the ratification, such decisions may be enacted into law.

===Rulers===
* 1879–1936: Hamad bin Abdullah Al Sharqi
* 1936–1938: Saif bin Hamad Al Sharqi
* 1938–1975: Mohammed bin Hamad Al Sharqi
* 1974–present: Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi

==Economy==
The Emirate of Fujairah&#x27;s economy is based on subsidies and federal government grants distributed by the government of Abu Dhabi (the seat of power in the UAE). Local industries consist of cement, stone crushing, and mining. A resurgence in the construction activity helped the local industry. There is a flourishing free trade zone, mimicking the success of the Dubai Free Zone Authority which was established around Jebel Ali Port.

The federal government employs the majority of the native, local workforce, with few opening businesses of their own. Many of the locals work in the service sector. The government of the Emirate of Fujairah prohibits foreigners from owning more than 49% of any business. The free zones have flourished, partly due to the relaxation of such prohibition within the zones, as full foreign ownership is allowed there. Shaikh Saleh Al Sharqi, younger brother to the ruler, is widely recognized as the driving force behind the commercialization of the economy.

The Emirate of Fujairah is a minor bunkering port with large scale shipping operations taking place every day. Shipping and ship-related services are thriving businesses in the city. Due to the business-friendly environment and ease of logistic support, ships trading from Persian Gulf anchor here for provisions, bunkers, repair, and technical support, spares, and stores before proceeding on long voyages. The city is also geographically well suited for such ship service-related activities.

The government of The Emirate of Fujairah is a major shareholder in the National Bank of Fujairah, a UAE local bank. Incorporated in 1982, the National Bank of Fujairah (NBF) is active in the areas of corporate and commercial banking, trade finance and treasury. NBF has also expanded portfolio to include personal banking options and Shariah-compliant services. NBF supports industries ranging from oil and shipping to services, manufacturing, construction, education, and healthcare.

===Land===
Foreigners or visitors are not allowed to buy land. Emirati nationals can purchase land from the government, after proving their nationality. If there is no suitable land available via the official government offices, private purchases can also be made, with the eventual price being determined by the market and the individuals themselves.

==Developments==
The ruler is planning to make changes that will affect the Emirate of Fujairah. Among tourism projects is an $817m resort, Al-Fujairah Paradise, near Dibba Al-Fujairah, on the northern Omani border, next to Le Meridien Al Aqah Beach Resort. The planned development would have around 1,000 five-star villas as well as hotels, but has since been cancelled.

The Sheikh is trying to improve opportunities for the local workforce, by trying to entice businesses to locate in the Emirate of Fujairah and diverting Federal funds to local companies in the form of development projects.

The Habshan–Fujairah oil pipeline was opened in 2012.

==Health care==
Health care is delivered in a mixed public and private system. Locals are treated for free at the federal government hospitals, while foreigners have to pay for medical care. The national government funds the federal hospitals and subsidize health care with petrodollar revenues. There are criticisms that the government is not providing health care sufficiently for those with low income, who have to pay for critical treatment themselves.

The government of the Emirate of Fujairah has built clinics, known locally as &quot;medical houses&quot;. These clinics complement and help lighten the load on the main Fujairah Hospital by allowing walk-in appointments and providing ancillary medical services. These clinics have turned out to be a success, visited by the local populace.

==Education==
There are many government schools in the Emirate of Fujairah, which are mainly for Emirati people, besides some numbers of Arab residents. Aside from government schools, there are also private schools, and due to the majority of the population of the Emirate hailing from the Indian subcontinent, most of the private schools follow the Indian Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus, accredited by the Central Education Board of India.

*Our Own English High School, Fujairah (which also provides International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE)), in the Al Faseel area.
*St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic High School, Fujairah (which also provides General Certificate of Education (GCE) A levels), in the Sakamkam area.
*Diyar International Private School, Fujairah and Dibba branch. It is located in Sakamkam, Fujairah and Dibba area.
*Indian School Fujairah, in the Al Faseel area.
*Fujairah Private Academy, also provides International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), A level, AS Level.
*Pakistan Islamia School, Fujairah, also in the Al Faseel area.
*Applied Technology High School, Fujairah
*GEMS Winchester, Fujairah (which also provides International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE)), in the Al Faseel area.

Fujairah Montessori Nursery is the oldest pre-school in the Emirate of Fujairah. It admits children from the age of two years. It is located in the Al Faseel area. There are several nursery and kindergarten schools in the Emirate of Fujairah. &#x27;Superbaby&#x27; in Al Faseel &#x27;Smart kids&#x27;, &#x27;Mom and Kids&#x27; and &#x27;Little Stars&#x27; are used by expat families.

==Travel==
Travel in and around the Emirate of Fujairah and the surrounding towns of Khor Fakkan, Kalba and Masafi has been made easy by the development of modern highways since independence in 1971. Highways are funded by the federal government directly, and contracts are tendered centrally. This is meant to safeguard the quality and delivery of the contracts and prevent corruption from damaging the construction.

The Emirate of Fujairah has a very limited public transport, with a single bus service operating within the emirate and a service operating to Dubai. Aside from private transport, there are several taxis operated by the government-owned Emirate of Fujairah Transport Corporation (FTC).

The new Sheikh Khalifa Highway linking Dubai and Fujairah was officially inaugurated on Saturday, 4 December 2011, following delays to the originally scheduled opening date of July 2011. It is a road that shortens the distance by . The Fujairah International Airport is near the city, with a large falcon statue at the airport roundabout. However, currently, it only offers commercial service to Abu Dhabi, a domestic destination within the UAE.

==Shopping==
LuLu Mall Fujairah opened in 2014. City Centre Fujairah opened in April 2012 with 105 units along with Century Mall near the Fujairah Ports. The construction of the Fujairah Mall was completed in 2016. Fathima Shopping Center in Fujairah is another shopping destination.

==Transport==
The Emirate of Fujairah is connected to other emirates by a highway called Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Highway and links Dubai and Sharjah to Fujairah within a 30 minutes drive. The road begins from the entrance of Fujairah, crossing Al Gazirmi locality, Wadi Sahm, Asfeeni, Mamdooh, Kadra and Shawka Valleys in Ras Al Khaimah, and ends at Maleeha Road in Sharjah, at Hamda area.

==Culture==
The UAE culture mainly revolves around the religion of Islam and traditional Arab culture. The influence of Islamic and Arab culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine, and lifestyle are very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country. Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday-Saturday, as a compromise between Friday&#x27;s holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday-Sunday. However as of January 2021 it has been changed to Saturday-Sunday to align with the rest of the world and make trading with other countries easy and efficient.

Drinking alcohol is allowed at designated hotels, and as of 2000, at a few bars. Until 1998, gambling in the form of slot machines was allowed in certain hotels, but personal petitions by locals to the Sheikh outlawed the activity. Some players were losing entire monthly wages on the slots, leaving nothing for the upkeep of their families.

Groups of Emirati youths tend to socialize together on the streets and cafés or outside games arcades, cinemas, and mini-malls. It is unusual to see mixed-sex groups due to gender segregation in Emirati society.

On vacations, many Fujairah residents travel to western emirates such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi, for entertainment and shopping purposes. They also visit the Wadis surrounding the emirate on camping and hiking trips. At the same time, other emirates&#x27; residents visit the Emirate of Fujairah for relaxation purposes and to get away from the stifling heat of the desert. Watersports such as jet skis, windsurfing, waterskiing and diving are becoming more and more popular amongst both locals and tourists. Professional driving instructors can be found in Le Méridien or in Royal Beach Hotel, where one can obtain an International Driving License, for a fee.

<doc id="434928" wikidata="Q170024" url="?curid=434928" title="Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah">
<text>Ras Al Khaimah is the northernmost of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates. The city of Ras Al Khaimah, abbreviated to RAK or RAK City, is the capital of the emirate and home to most of the emirate&#x27;s residents. It is linked to the Islamic trading port of Julfar, its predecessor settlement. Its name in English means &quot;headland of the tent&quot;. The emirate borders Oman&#x27;s exclave of Musandam, and occupies part of the same peninsula. It covers an area of and has of beach coastline. As of 2023, the emirate had a population of about 400,000.

The city of Ras Al Khaimah has two main areas — the Old Town and Nakheel — on either side of a creek that is home to mangroves and is framed by the North-Western Hajar Mountains. The emirate also consists of several villages and new gated residential developments, such as Al Hamra Village and Mina Al Arab. The emirate is served by Ras Al Khaimah International Airport. Its geography consists of a northern part (where Ras Al Khaimah City and most towns are situated) and a large southerly inland exclave with an area of 866.50 km² and a population of 14.533 as of 2017 (near the Dubai exclave of Hatta), and a few small islands in the Persian Gulf. Ras Al Khaimah has the most fertile soil in the country, due to a larger share of rainfall and underground water streams from the Hajar Mountains, which overlook the city on the landward side.

==History==
Ras Al Khaimah has been the site of continuous human habitation for 7,000 years, one of the few places in the country and the world where this is the case, and there are many historical and archaeological sites throughout the emirate - local sources cite 1,000 - dating from different time periods, including remnants of the Umm Al Nar Culture (3rd millennium BC). The area of Shimal contains both Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq burials and a number of notable finds, including one grave that contained no fewer than 18 fine bronze arrowheads.

Wadi Suq era graves found at Seih Al Harf in the Emirate in October 2012 briefly held up the construction of the northern spur of the arterial E611 road.

Ras Al Khaimah is often linked with the medieval port and city of Julfar, but was in fact an independent settlement that eventually grew to encapsulate the area formerly occupied by Julfar.

Archaeological evidence has demonstrated that Julfar shifted location over time as harbour channels silted up. Excavations of a sizable tell, which revealed remnants of a Sassanid era fortification, indicate that early Julfar was located in the north of the present city of Ras Al Khaimah, not far from other sites of historical and archaeological interest such as the Pre-Islamic fort, &#x27;Sheba&#x27;s Palace&#x27; (Shimal Fort).

One of Ras Al Khaimah&#x27;s most celebrated sons, Ibn Majid, was a hugely influential seaman, navigator and cartographer, and there is evidence in his writing that the town he came from was at that time known as Ras Al Khaimah, that town having eclipsed Julfar as the principal port and settlement of the Shimal coast.

===Pirate coast===

There is considerable debate locally regarding the 18th-century charge of maritime piracy, attracting the British label &#x27;The Pirate Coast&#x27; to the Eastern Gulf. The historian and Sultan of Sharjah, Sulṭān ibn Muḥammad al-Qāsimī, has written that the allegations of piracy were exaggerated by the East India Company to cut off the untaxed trade routes between the Middle East and Company rule in India. However, in the early 18th century, the Qawasim (singular Al Qasimi) established themselves in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah on the Arabian Peninsula, growing to become a significant maritime force with holdings on both the Persian and Arabian coasts that frequently came into conflict with British flagged shipping.

It was the Al Qasimi links to Persia that drew them to the attention of Ahmed bin Said, the Ruler of Muscat, who had wrested control of the coast and interior of Oman back from the Persian forces who had taken it under Nadir Shah and Mirza Taki Khan, the governor of Shiraz. Ahmed bin Said threw 12,000 men under the command of Kandhala bin Saif Al Suwaidi in an attack on Ras Al Khaimah which was met at Buraimi by 14,000 men of the Al Qasimi and Na&#x27;im. They were defeated, leading the garrison at Khor Fakkan, besieged by Ahmed bin Said, to surrender. He went on to take Khasab and then blockaded Ras Al Khaimah, Rams, Jazirat Al Hamra, Fasht and Sharjah. This led to all but Ras Al Khaimah suing for peace in 1763. The Sheikhs of Ras Al Khaimah submitted in 1771, but in 1775 revolted and re-took the towns on the West and East coast, consolidating their gains under the weak rule of Sultan bin Ahmed bin Saeed. This longstanding war between the Al Qasimi and Muscat pitted them naturally against Muscat&#x27;s ally – Britain.

In the aftermath of a series of attacks in 1808 off the coast of Sindh involving 50 Qasimi raiders and following the 1809 monsoon season, the British authorities in India decided to make a significant show of force against the Al Qasimi, in an effort not only to destroy their larger bases and as many ships as could be found, but also to counteract French encouragement of them from their embassies in Persia and Oman. The British mounted the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809, in which the Al Qasimi fleet was largely destroyed. The British operation continued to Lingeh on the Persian coast which was, like the Greater and Lesser Tunbs islands, administered by the Al Qasimi.

By the morning of 14 November, the military expedition was over and the British forces returned to their ships, having suffered light casualties of five killed and 34 wounded. Arab losses are unknown, but were probably significant, while the damage done to the Al Qasimi fleets was severe: a significant portion of their vessels had been destroyed.

====1819 campaign====

With the 1809 campaign concluded without significant treaty concessions, an 1815 arrangement was made between the British and the Al Qasimi. By 1819, it was clear the arrangement had broken down and so in November of that year, the British embarked on a second expedition against the Al Qasimi, led by Major-General William Keir Grant, voyaging to Ras Al Khaimah with a force of 3,000 soldiers. The British extended an offer to Said bin Sultan of Muscat in which he would be made the ruler of the Pirate Coast if he agreed to assist the British in their expedition. Obligingly, he sent a force of 600 men and two ships.

The force gathered off the coast of Ras Al Khaimah on 25 and 26 November and, on 2 and 3 December, troops were landed south of the town and set up batteries of guns and mortars and, on 5 December, the town was bombarded from both land and sea. Continued bombardment took place over the following four days until, on the 9th, fortress and town of Ras Al Khaimah were stormed and found to be practically deserted. On the fall of Ras Al Khaimah, three cruisers were sent to blockade Rams to the North and this, too was found to be deserted and its inhabitants retired to the &#x27;impregnable&#x27; hill-top fort of Dhayah.

The British landed a force at Rams on 18 December, which fought its way inland through date plantations to Dhayah Fort on the 19th. There, 398 men and another 400 women and children held out, without sanitation, water or effective cover from the sun, for three days under heavy fire from mortars and 12-pound cannon.
The two 24-pound cannon from HMS Liverpool which had been used to bombard Ras Al Khaimah from the landward side were once again pressed into use and dragged across the plain from Rams, a journey of some four miles. Each of the guns weighed over 2 tonnes. After enduring two hours of sustained fire from the big guns, which breached the fort&#x27;s walls, the last of the Al Qasimi surrendered at 10.30 on the morning of 22 December.

====1820 treaty====
In January 1820, the British imposed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 signed by Sheikh Sultan Bin Saqr Al Qasimi of Sharjah who was reinstated by the British in Ras Al Khaimah after the deposition of Hasan Bin Rahma Al Qasimi. The treaty stipulated the end of piracy and slavery, and laid the foundation for the British protectorate over the Trucial States that lasted until December 1971. In 1869, Ras Al Khaimah became fully independent from neighbouring Sharjah. However, from September 1900 to 7 July 1921, it was re-incorporated into Sharjah; the last governor became its next independent ruler.

===Joining the United Arab Emirates===
On 10 February 1972, Ras Al Khaimah, under the leadership of Sheikh Saqr bin Mohammad al-Qasimi, joined the United Arab Emirates after the Iranian seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs.

===Modern history===
In 2020, Ras Al Khaimah&#x27;s Antiquities and Museums Department formed a partnership with the University of South Alabama and Quinnipiac University to study 4,000-year-old human remains found in Shimal.

The Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah will contain the first casino in the country when Wynn Al Marjan Island opens in 2027.

==Economy==

===Main economic sectors===
As one of the emirates that has never discovered oil, Ras Al Khaimah has focused on diversifying its economy and has had real success with its thriving industrial sector. It has one of the most diverse economies in the Gulf Cooperation Council region, with no one area exceeding more than 20% of total GDP. The main economic sectors are the following:

* Real Estate – numerous residential areas, offices, commercial buildings have been built in Ras Al Khaimah and several major developments are ongoing. Major multi-purpose developments include Al Hamra Village and Mina Al Arab. Al Marjan Island is one of its most visited spots which also is now home to numerous luxurious and high-end real estate projects headed by top developers of the country. With high capital appreciation and a favorable business environment, the appeal for real estate projects is getting increasingly highlighted. They are drawing significant attention from foreign investors, and steadily helping Ras Al Khaimah rise as a real estate powerhouse.
* Tourism – Ras Al Khaimah is a fast-growing tourist destination, with a focus on sun and sand vacations and also adventure tourism due to its mountains, which feature the longest zipline in the world, Jebel Jais Flight, and Jais Adventure Peak, a collection of adventure attractions such as Jais Sky Tour, Jebel Jais Viewing Deck Park and Jais Adventure Centre, which opened in February 2020. It is home to five-star hotels and beach resorts including the Waldorf Astoria Ras Al Khaimah, the Ritz-Carlton Al Wadi and Beach resorts, the Cove Rotana and several Hilton hotels. In addition, it has a number of 4 and 3-star accommodation. In the pipeline is an Anantara resort, an InterContinental, a Marriott, Movenpick, a Rove hotel, an Avani resort and many more. 2018 saw Ras Al Khaimah host the Arabian Hotel Investment Conference, the first time it had been hosted outside Dubai, and the event returned in 2019 to the newly built Al Hamra International Exhibition &amp; Conference Centre.
* Building materials – Ras Al Khaimah opened the UAE&#x27;s first cement company in the early 1970s and is now the UAE&#x27;s largest producer of cement. In the 1980s, the emirate formed Ras Al Khaimah Ceramics, which has become one of the world&#x27;s largest ceramics producers. It is also home to Stevin Rock and RAK Rock, sister rock quarrying companies that collectively are among the largest quarrying companies in the world, providing 80 million tons of limestone to the construction sector annually.
* Manufacturing and High-Tech Industry – In the 1980s, the emirate formed Julphar, the Persian Gulf region&#x27;s first pharmaceuticals company. Julphar is now one of the Middle East and Africa&#x27;s largest pharmaceutical manufacturers, producing more than a million boxes of medicine each day. Ras Al Khaimah also became the first place in the Persian Gulf region to produce vehicles from a global manufacturer when Ashok Leyland started production in 2010. The Indian company now produces 12,400 vehicles a year from its base in the emirate. Falcon Technologies International (FTI) represents the high-tech industry and produces optical storage media (CDR, DVDR, BDR). In 2012, Innovative Composite Engineering was established in the Industrial Free-zone to manufacture high-end composite products (aerospace, construction parts).
* Service sector – growing sector with RAKBANK, the UAE&#x27;s No.1 small business bank, and RAK Insurance companies. In February 2020, RAKBANK posted profits of AED1,095.3 million for 2019, up 19.4% on the previous year, with total assets of AED57.1 billion. RAK Economic Zone, the emirate&#x27;s free zone and business set-up specialists, is home to more than 15,000 businesses from 100 countries operating in 50 sectors.
* Agriculture and Fisheries – in the past, these were the main economic sectors of Ras Al Khaimah. Nowadays they are still significant, providing foodstuffs not only for the emirate but for the whole UAE.

===Taxation and companies law===
Taxation is legislated for by the UAE Federal Authorities and implemented across the seven Emirates of the UAE by the Federal Tax Authorities. In general, no income or wealth taxes are payable by individuals nor is corporation tax charged. In addition, there are no exchange controls or withholding taxes. However, a sales tax at 5% (VAT) was imposed in 2018 and import taxes apply in certain circumstances.

Whilst a local partner or sponsor is typically required to do business, companies may be owned 100% by foreign investors in one of the many Free Trade Zones in Ras Al Khaimah which include Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone, RAK Maritime City Free Trade Zone, RAK International Corporate Centre. These zones provide trade and access to the Middle East, and wider markets in a variety of sectors including manufacturing and industry, education, consultancy and professional services, technology and aviation. Employment visas are available for these companies and, when approved, this type of company can own property. International, or &quot;offshore&quot; free zone companies are also available to be used for numerous business purposes, ranging from owning overseas financial and real estate assets, inheritance planning, setting up holding companies and special purpose vehicles and ship registration.

==Culture==
The UAE culture mainly revolves around the religion of Islam and traditional Arab culture. The influence of Islamic and Arab culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine and lifestyle are very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country. Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday-Saturday, as a compromise between Friday&#x27;s holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday-Sunday. A great majority of the population are non national citizens, coming from India, Pakistan, and a wide range of nations.

===Events===
The annual Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon, first held in 2007, resulted in a world record from Samuel Wanjiru in 2007 and the second fastest run of all time from Patrick Makau Musyoki in 2009. Kenya&#x27;s 19-year-old Stephen Kiprop won the 2019 edition of the half marathon in a course record-equaling 58 minutes and 42 seconds, the fastest time ever recorded by a teenager.

In the 2020 iteration, Ethiopia&#x27;s Ababel Yeshaneh broke the women&#x27;s half marathon world record by 20 seconds with a time of 1:04:31, eclipsing the previous record of 1:04:51 set by Kenyan Joyciline Jepkosgei in Valencia in 2017.

The UAE Awafi Festival is an annual cultural and heritage festival held in the Ras Al Khaimah desert. It is a three-week event, held in December or January, one attraction being a sand dune race. There is a heritage village with traditional food and dance, as well as shops for food and souvenirs.

The Terry Fox Run RAK is a yearly charity run organized in Ras Al Khaimah to support cancer research in the UAE. The first event was organized in 2010. Participation in this event has grown from hundreds to thousands since its inception, averaging about 5,000 participants in recent years.

Ras Al Khaimah Art is an annual event that has taken place since 2013, organised by the Al Qasimi Foundation for Policy Research. It started with just 26 artists but by 2018 that number had grown to 84. The not-for-profit festival takes place every February–March and since 2019 has taken place at the redeveloped Al Jazirah Al Hamra Heritage Village.

Each year, a number of events are lined up in Ras Al Khaimah to mark the United Arab Emirates&#x27; National Day, usually involving an air show by the &quot;Fursan Al Emarat&quot; aerobatics team and a free concert featuring some of the best singers in the Arab world.

In 2018, Ras Al Khaimah became the new host for the season-ending tournament on the Challenge Tour, the second tier of European Tour golf. The &quot;Road to Ras Al Khaimah&quot; ends with the Ras Al Khaimah Challenge Tour Grand Final played at Al Hamra Golf Course.

2022 marked the start of the Ras Al Khaimah Championship golf event, a top-tier European Tour event bringing the top players on the tour to Al Hamra Golf Club each February.

===Transportation===

Within Ras Al Khaimah city, the main mode of public transport are metered taxis, with public buses operating on long-haul routes and catering mainly to smaller towns (e.g. Sha`am, Rams, and Al Jazirah Al Hamra). A local bus service operated by RAK Transport Authority provides infrequent connections between Nakheel, Al Hamra and the airport. In November 2019, RAK Transport Authority launched its five-year strategy for 2020–2025, part of which involved making its entire fleet of cars eco-friendly. At the time, 60% of its fleet of 850 taxis were already hybrid.

Ras Al Khaimah is connected to the other emirates by taxis and buses which embark from the Bus station located at RAK Transport Authority Headquarters near the new Ras Al Khaimah Police Headquarters and opposite the Cove Rotana hotel.

The main highways linking Ras Al Khaimah with other emirates is Mohammed bin Zayed Road (E311) and Emirates Road (E611), both of which travel from Ras Al Khaimah through Umm Al Quwain, Ajman and Sharjah and onto Dubai and Abu Dhabi. These highways allow for journeys from Ras Al Khaimah to Dubai in under 45 minutes.

Dual carriageways connect major areas within the emirate, with one following the coast and another running inland towards the airport in the direction of Khatt, Masafi, Fujairah, Dhaid, and eventually Oman.

In July 2018, the first phase of the Ras Al Khaimah Ring Road opened, connecting the industrial areas of the mountainous north with the E311 to the south. The road has decreased the volume of industrial traffic through RAK City. In spring 2013 work on the RAK Ring Road was held up by a three-month rescue excavation after the discovery of megalithic tombs dating to the Wadi Suq period, from 2000 to 1600 BC.

Saqr Port, located in the industrial area of Khor Khwair, is the emirate&#x27;s main port, providing bulk and container services. It is the largest bulk-handling port in the Middle East. It has eight deep-water berths, each long, is dredged to and has two &quot;ro-ro&quot; ramps plus specialised berths for handling bulk cement and aggregate. Other services include ship-handling, crew changes, and of covered storage, together with a vast open storage area. It is also the closest port in the UAE to Bandar Abbas, Iran, but there is no shipping from Saqr port to Bandar Abbas.

Ras Al Khaimah International Airport (RKT) offers cargo and passenger services to a variety of destinations covering the Middle East, North &amp; East Africa, Central Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and Europe (to Luxembourg). It serves as a hub for low-cost carrier Air Arabia and, in May 2019, it was announced that direct flights operated by Pegasus Airlines would commence to Istanbul, Turkey, from Ras Al Khaimah in October 2019. In 2023, Qatar Airways started direct flights from Ras Al Khaimah International Airport, connecting the emirate to the airline&#x27;s 160 global destinations via Doha.

SpiceJet, India&#x27;s second largest carrier, announced in October, 2019 that RAK Airport would become its first overseas hub in a deal that brought with it direct flights from the Indian capital New Delhi to Ras Al Khaimah.

<doc id="434929" wikidata="Q175021" url="?curid=434929" title="Emirate of Umm Al Quwain">
<text>The Emirate of Umm Al Quwain (UAQ; ; ) is one of the seven constituent emirates of the United Arab Emirates, located in the north of the country. It is the second smallest and least populous emirate in the UAE and borders the Persian Gulf. Umm Al Quwain lies between Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah/Ajman on the west coast. It has a coastline stretching to 24 km (15 miles). It had 72,000 inhabitants in 2007 and has an area of .

The Emirate of Umm Al Quwain was formed in 1775, when Sheikh Majid Al Mualla established it as an independent sheikhdom. The emirate is now ruled by Saud bin Rashid Al Mualla. The current crown prince is Rashid bin Saud bin Rashid Al Mua&#x27;lla, and the deputy ruler is Abdullah bin Rashid Al Mualla III. 

The emirate consists in the main of the coastal city of Umm Al Quwain and the inland oasis town of Falaj Al Mualla, some from the coast. The Population of the Emirate is 49,159 according to the census of December 2005. The city of Umm Al Quwain is the capital of the Emirate.

Unlike some of its neighbours, Umm Al Quwain has not made any significant find of oil or gas in its territory and depends on revenue from hotels, parks and tourism, fisheries and general trading activities as well as the Umm Al Quwain Free Zone (UAQFTZ) based at Port Ahmed Bin Rashid.

A number of government initiatives and strategies have been put in place to incentivise growth in trade and industrial activity in the emirate, including a 2018 move to reduce government fees to business and waive fines and violations levied against businesses which had not renewed their trade licenses.

==Etymology==
Multiple theories have been established on the etymology of the name Umm Al Quwain. The most accepted meaning is that the name means &quot;mother of the two powers&quot; - from the phrase &quot;Umm Al Quwatain&quot; (). The two powers here are usually indicated as the two forms of geographical powers. Locals describe it as the richness of activities both on land and water, others refer to it as the two powers of economy and agriculture. Another theory is that the word &quot;Quwain&quot; is inspired by an Arabic word &quot;Qawn&quot; meaning ‘iron‘. Therefore, some believe that it may refer to iron in the place.

==History and prehistory==
The Emirate of Umm Al Quwain holds significant archaeological interest, with major finds at both Tell Abraq and Ed-Dur pointing to significant ancient Near Eastern cities. Arrowheads and other polished flint tools have been unearthed in various sites across the UAE while pieces of Ubaid Age pottery have been unearthed along the shores of the emirate. All evidence obtained so far indicate that contact with Mesopotamia existed as early as the 5th millennium BC, as an indigenous ceramic industry, did not emerge until the 3rd century BC.

Finds at both Tell Abraq and Ed-Dur show habitation in the area throughout the Bronze Age, from the Hafit period, through the Umm Al Nar period and the later Wadi Suq and Iron I, II and III ages. Finds also link Ed-Dur with the inland settlement of Mleiha, especially distinctive burials of animals with their heads turned back on their bodies. Significant trading links with both the western Sumerian culture and the eastern Indus Valley culture are displayed at these sites, with the semi-nomadic Magan people smelting bronze mined in the Hajar Mountains and then shipping the smelted ore.

Macedonian coinage unearthed at Ed-Dur dates back to Alexander the Great, while hundreds of coins have been found bearing the name of Abi&#x27;el. In March 2019, 15 tombs, bronze statues, settlement remains, jewellery and pottery, dating back to the 1st century CE, were unearthed here. It is thought Ed-Dur is the site of &quot;Omana&quot;, mentioned by both Pliny and Strabo as an important town in the Lower Persian Gulf.

During the Bronze Age, agriculture flourished, with dates being the prominent crop. Wheat, millet and other grains were also cultivated wherever there was enough water for irrigation. It is now widely believed that the climate during the period was more temperate than now.

In 2022 the remains of a 6th/7th Century Eastern Christian monastery were found on Umm Al Quwain&#x27;s Siniyah Island and in 2023, extensive remains of what stands as the oldest pearl diving town in the Persian Gulf were found on the island.

The modern history of Umm Al Quwain began some 200 years ago when the Al Ali tribe moved their capital from Siniyah Island to its current location in the mid-18th century due to declining water resources. After that, in 1775, Umm Al Quwain was declared an independent Sheikhdom. Siniyah was eventually abandoned following bombardment by British forces during the Persian Gulf Campaign of 1819.

The Emirate of Umm Al Quwain was the site of a fort built in 1768 by the founder of the modern Al Mualla dynasty, Sheikh Rashid bin Majid of the Al Ali tribe. The fort was the site of a coup in 1929. Sheikh Hamad Bin Ibrahim Al Mualla was assassinated by one of his blind uncle’s servants. The townsfolk, not liking the new leadership, rose and set fire to the fort, killing the usurpers, putting Ahmad bin Rashid Al Mualla in power. The fort has since been restored and now houses the Umm Al Quwain National Museum.

On 8 January 1820, Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid signed the General Maritime Treaty with the United Kingdom, thus accepting a British protectorate in order to keep the Ottoman Turks out. Like Ajman, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah, its position on the route to India made it important enough to be recognized as a salute state with a three gun salute.

By 1908, J. G. Lorimer&#x27;s famous survey of the Trucial Coast, the &quot;Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia&quot;, had Umm Al Quwain listed as a town of some 5,000 inhabitants and identified as the major boat-building centre on the coast, producing some 20 boats a year compared to 10 in Dubai and 5 in Sharjah.

On 2 December 1971, Sheikh Ahmad bin Rashid joined its neighbors Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman and Fujairah in forming the United Arab Emirates, with Ras Al-Khaimah joining later in early 1972.
====Petrochemicals====
The American oil company Occidental acquired a concession to search for oil in Umm Al Quwain territorial waters on 19 November 1969. Occidental proposed drilling an exploratory well nine miles from the island of Abu Musa in the Persian Gulf in what it considered to be Umm Al Quwain waters. However, this conflicted with a 12-mile territorial limit claimed by Sharjah. On 15 May 1970, the British authorities referred the dispute to arbitration, but ruled that Occidental could continue to drill. On 20 May, Iran informed the British that it laid claim to Abu Musa and the two Tunbs&#x27; islands, and would intercede if Occidental continued to drill. The British proposed a three-month suspension of drilling pending the outcome of arbitration, a decision enforced by a British minesweeper, which intercepted Occidental&#x27;s drilling platform and moved it out of the area.

The agreement between Sharjah and Iran over the island of Abu Musa, made on 29 November 1971 and the subsequent invasion of the islands on 30 November 1971 rendered the issue moot. Occidental would never find oil under its Umm Al Quwain concession. The issue was subsequently settled by an informal agreement, which granted Umm Al Quwain 15% share of the oil revenues from the area.

==Demographics==

== Economy and business ==
Umm Al Quwain was relying heavily on sources of revenue from hotels, parks, and tourism. In 2011, tourism and trade were given the top priority in the Umm Al Quwain&#x27;s Government Strategy 2011-2013 to support small- and mid-sized business space and the fisheries sector to help make the emirate attractive to foreign investment. 

===Vision 2021===
In 2018, the government launched Umm Al Quwain Vision 2021 to implement comprehensive structural development through programs and initiatives and provide high-quality living standards for a cohesive society. The vision comprises five main pillars: 
*A sustainable and diversified economy;
*Social solidarity
*Attractive tourism
*Excellent infrastructure, and
*Innovative government. 
The government business initiatives and programs serve as a medium to support local businesses and industries to grow and boost partnerships with the private sector to build an economy based on knowledge, research, and development.

=== Free trade zone ===
The Free Trade Zone of Umm Al Quwain (UAQ FTZ) was established in 1987. It was previously known as Ahmed Bin Rashid Port and Free Zone. The UAQ Free Trade Zone has been awarded the winner of the Qadat Al Tagheer Award for the “Best Free Zone for Start-ups and SMEs” at the 5th UAE - India Economic Forum (UIEF) in 2019.

==Climate and environment==

During November to March, the average temperature is by day and at night, but it can rise to over in the peak of the summer and when humidity levels are high. The rainfall is minimal and averages a year. The coastline experiences cooling sea breezes during the day.

Al Sinniyah island, close to the city of Umm Al Quwain is home to the UAE&#x27;s largest Socotra cormorant colony, with over 15,000 pairs making it the third largest colony in the world. Arabian gazelles have been introduced to Sinniyah and appear to be prospering. Marine life is remarkable for its abundance and diversity. Blacktip reef sharks patrol the outer shoreline, while green turtles are ubiquitous in the inner leads in particular. Between Al Sinniyah and the mainland is Khor Al Beidah, an expansive area of sand and mud flats of international importance for its waterfowl. Although not formally protected, the island of Sinaiyah, along with Khor Al Beidah, is one of the largest areas of undisturbed and varied coastal environment remaining anywhere in the UAE.

==Culture==
The UAE culture mainly revolves around the religion of Islam and traditional Arab culture. The influence of Islamic and Arab culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine and lifestyle are very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country. Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday-Saturday, as a compromise between Friday&#x27;s holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday-Sunday.

==Tourism==
Umm Al Quwain Fort: A fort which was once home to the emirate&#x27;s ruler and guarded the entrance to the old town, overseeing the sea on one side and the creek on the other. It eventually became a police station then a museum. The museum now houses artifacts found at important nearby sites including Ed-Dur and houses a collection of weapons that were used through the emirate&#x27;s history. It is located near a Masjid (Mosque) in Umm Al Quwain Bazaar.

Old Harbour: An old harbour located in the old town overlooking the traditional dhow building yard where skilled craftsmen continue to assemble these traditional boats. The harbor is surrounded by old coral stone houses that display features of the original architecture and intricate sculptured plaster work.

Islands of Umm Al Quwain: Islands that lie to the east of the mainland peninsula on a unique stretch of coastline consisting of sandy islands surrounded by dense mangrove forests, separated by a series of creeks. The largest of the seven islands is Sinniyah, followed by Jazirat Al Ghallah and Al Keabe, all of which are visible from the old town. Tucked in between these and the coastal plains are the smaller islands of Al Sow, Al Qaram, Al Humaidi, Al Chewria and Al Harmala. The Madaar creek that runs between the islands provides a navigable waterway for fisherman even at low tide when the average depth is less than a few feet.

Ed-Dur: Located to the north of Umm Al Quwain, the ancient city of Ed-Dur is considered the largest pre-Islamic site on the Persian Gulf coast. There are two public monuments at Ed-Dour, a small square fort with round corner towers and a small square temple dedicated to the Semitic sun god Shamash. The site is not open to the public.

Dreamland Aqua Park: is located on the coastline of Umm Al Quwain; about 40 minutes drive from Dubai, with expanse of landscaped gardens and over 30 rides, slides, and attractions. The Park is operated all year round with a daily capacity of ten thousand visitors.

<doc id="434931" wikidata="Q215569" url="?curid=434931" title="Alain Juppé">
<text>Alain Marie Juppé (; born 15 August 1945) is a French politician. A member of The Republicans, he was Prime Minister of France from 1995 to 1997 under President Jacques Chirac, during which period he faced major strikes that paralysed the country and became very unpopular. He left office after the victory of the left in the snap 1997 legislative elections. He had previously served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1993 to 1995, and as Minister of the Budget and Spokesman for the Government from 1986 to 1988. He was president of the political party Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) from 2002 to 2004 and mayor of Bordeaux from 2006 to 2019.

After the ghost jobs affair in December 2004, Juppé suspended his political career until he was re-elected as mayor of Bordeaux in October 2006. He served briefly as Minister of State for Ecology and Sustainable Development in 2007, but resigned in June 2007 after failing in his bid to be re-elected in the 2007 legislative election. He was Minister of Defence and Veterans Affairs from 2010 to 2011 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2011 to 2012.

Juppé announced in 2015 his intention to contest his party&#x27;s primary election ahead of the 2017 presidential election. He came in second place in the first open primary of the right and centre, and in the run-off, he lost to François Fillon. At the beginning of 2019, he accepted a nomination to become a member of the French Constitutional Council and subsequently announced that he would be resigning as mayor of Bordeaux.

==Early life==

Juppé was born Alain Marie Juppé on 15 August 1945, in Mont-de-Marsan, Aquitaine. His father was Robert Juppé (1915-1998), a Gaullist resistance fighter at the end of World War II, who came from a family of railwaymen and later became a farmer, and his mother was Marie Darroze (1910-2004), the devoted Catholic daughter of a judge.

His secondary studies have taken place at the Lycée Victor-Duruy (Landes). At 17, he graduated with a Baccalauréat. He then came to Paris for a literary preparatory classe at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and entered the (ENS) in 1964 to get a Classics &quot;agrégation&quot; in 1967. He completed his degrees at Sciences Po (1968) and at the National School of Administration (ENA) (1970-1972). From 1969 to 1970, he executed his compulsory military service.

== Political career ==

=== Early political career (1976–1986) ===
Alain Juppé&#x27;s profession, outside politics, is Inspector of Finances, a position from which he was on leave to hold his various elected and appointed offices. He retired from the Inspection of Finances on 1 January 2003.

As a senior civil servant, he met Jacques Chirac at the end of the 1970s and became his adviser in the city council of Paris. In 1981, he was selected to be one of the first &quot;Young Leaders&quot; of the French-American Foundation.

A member of the RPR since its foundation in 1976, he lost his first attempts to be elected during the 1978 legislative elections and the 1979 cantonal elections. Then he moved to Paris to work with Chirac as one of the closest advisors to the mayor. In 1979, he was elected at the national board of the party. Two years later, he became the second manager of Chirac&#x27;s campaign for the presidential election. Chirac ended third with 18% of the vote.

With Michel Aurillac, he led the club 89, officially a think tank, indeed a sort of counter-government to prepare the 1986 legislative elections. The victory of the RPR-UDF alliance in this ballot made Socialist President Mitterrand appointing Chirac as his Prime Minister.

=== Cabinet member (1986–1995) ===

He was minister of budget and spokesperson of Jacques Chirac&#x27;s government from 1986 to 1988. He contributed to the free-market policy of Edouard Balladur, minister of Finances, during these years. During the 1988 presidential election, he combined these positions with those of spokesman of Chirac&#x27;s campaign and head of his support committee.

Then, he was secretary general of the Rally for the Republic (&quot;Rassemblement pour la République&quot; or RPR) political party from 1988 to 1995. His role was to maintain Chirac&#x27;s leadership on the party against the rise of the younger generation of &quot;renovators&quot; and of sovereignist Gaullists such as Philippe Séguin and Charles Pasqua. Pasqua humorously wrote in his Memoirs : &quot;The RPR was now ruled like the North-Korean Communist Party... without the enlightened leadership of Kim Il Sung&quot;. He led the RPR-UDF alliance with former President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing for the 1989 European elections but resigned from the European Parliament some months later because he was only needed to be a kind of electoral locomotive. In 1992, Chirac and Juppé supported the treaty of Maastricht against the majority of the RPR&#x27;s members. The Gaullist fringe then considered him as a traitor.

In 1993, he was made Édouard Balladur&#x27;s Foreign Minister. Along with President Mitterrand, he advocated a French expedition in Rwanda to save the most possible of threaten lives, while Prime minister Balladur and Defense minister François Léotard were fearing a slip toward a colonial intervention. Juppé defended the Turquoise Operation at the United Nations. Some controversies have emerged later on this subject (in August 2008, he was named in a Rwandan government report on the alleged &quot;French connection&quot; in the Rwanda genocide during his tenure as Foreign Minister). From a general point of view, he has been considered to be one of the best Foreign ministers in France&#x27;s recent history. Although he held the position of president of the RPR, he participated in the debate and endorsed Jacques Chirac instead of Balladur in the 1995 presidential election.

=== Prime Minister of France (1995–1997) ===
Because he supported Jacques Chirac against Edouard Balladur during the 1995 presidential campaign, he succeeded him as Prime Minister, also becoming president of the RPR. Jacques Chirac claimed Alain Juppé was &quot;the best among us&quot;.

However, in November/December 1995, his plan for Welfare State reform caused the biggest social conflict since May 68 and, under duress, abandoned it. He became the most unpopular Prime Minister of the Fifth Republic (challenged only by Édith Cresson). 

In January 1996, Alain Juppé, together with interior minister Jean-Louis Debré, opened negotiations with the FLNC-Canal Historique, then the largest guerrilla group in the Corsican conflict. The ensuing Tralonca peace campaign became Juppé’s priority in government, holding numerous meetings and conferences and even traveling to Corsica. the peace would fail in 1996 after the French government refused to release political prisoners arrested during the peace process.

In spring 1997, President Chirac dissolved the National Assembly but lost the legislative election. Alain Juppé was succeeded by the Socialist Lionel Jospin. Furthermore, Juppé left the leadership of the RPR.

He campaigned for the unification of all the parties of the centre right behind Jacques Chirac. In this, he was considered the architect of the Union for the Presidential Majority which became the Union for a Popular Movement (&quot;Union pour un mouvement populaire&quot; or UMP), and was its first president from 2002 to 2004.

As a member of the National Assembly (as representative of Paris from 1986 to 1997, then representative of Gironde), he was elected Mayor of Bordeaux in 1995, succeeding former Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas.

=== Criminal conviction (1999–2006) ===
In 2004, Alain Juppé was tried for the felony of abuse of public funds, when he was head of the RPR and the RPR illegally used personnel provided by the City of Paris for running its operations. He was convicted and sentenced to an 18-month suspended jail sentence, the deprivation of civic rights for five years, and the deprivation of the right to run for political office for 10 years. He appealed the decision, whereupon his disqualification from holding elected office was reduced to one year and the suspended sentence cut to 14 months. He announced he would not appeal the ruling before the Court of Cassation. (See Corruption scandals in the Paris region.)

As a consequence, Alain Juppé resigned his mayoralty of Bordeaux and his position of head of the Bordeaux urban community.

The court commented:
It is regrettable that at the time when the legislative body became aware of the need to end criminal practices which existed for the financing of political parties, Mr Juppé did not apply to his own party the very rules that he had voted for in Parliament.
It is equally regrettable that Mr Juppé, whose intellectual qualities are unanimously recognized, did not judge appropriate to assume before Justice his entire criminal responsibility and kept on denying established facts.
However, Mr Juppé has given himself for many years to the service of the State, while he did obtain no personal enrichment from these crimes he committed for the benefit of his political party, for which he should not be a scapegoat.

Some commentators, such as Jean-Marc Ayrault, head of the National Assembly group of the Socialist Party, have argued that Juppé, in this judicial group, paid for a wider responsibility than his own.

Some law professors argued that the Versailles court could not legally exempt Juppé from a disposition of the Electoral Code article L7, which bars any person sentenced for illegal taking of interests from being on an electoral roll for a period of 5 years, also preventing that person from running for office. Another disposition of the Electoral Code specifies that any person deprived of the right to be on an electoral roll for a certain period following a judicial sentence is deprived of the right of running for the French National Assembly for double that period, which would bar Juppé for 10 years. When Alain Juppé registered again as a voter, other voters sued to have his registration cancelled; however, the Bordeaux court of small claims ruled against them. Some of the plaintiffs declared they would appeal the decision before the Court of Cassation.
Another possible issue is that should Alain Juppé be elected to national office, the Constitutional Council could cancel the election on grounds that Juppé was illegally registered as a voter. President Jacques Chirac could have used his right of pardon in favor of Juppé, but this would have probably been politically disastrous.

Juppé considered giving classes on public administration at a variety of prominent United States and Quebec universities and colleges, including the UQÀM in Montreal, some of which were initially receptive to having a former prime minister be a member of their faculty. However, following Juppé&#x27;s conviction, his appointment was contested by some teachers. Juppé was finally taken in by the École nationale d&#x27;administration publique in Montreal where he served as a full-time faculty member for the academic year 2005–2006.

=== Return to public life (2006–2010) ===
Juppé was reelected as Mayor of Bordeaux in October 2006, suggesting that voters had forgiven him for the conviction.

In May 2007, he was appointed Minister of State, Minister of Ecology and Sustainable Development in the Government of François Fillon, being in fact the number two of the Government in protocolar order. This is the third time in the history of Fifth Republic (after Michel Debré and Laurent Fabius) that a former Prime Minister returned as a Minister in another government (although some Presidents of the Council of the Fourth Republic were Ministers of the Fifth Republic).

Juppé ran unsuccessfully in the 2007 legislative elections, and as a consequence announced his resignation from the government. Prime Minister Fillon had announced that all ministers that chose to run in these elections and were beaten would have to leave the government, for it meant that these ministers did not enjoy the confidence of the people.

On 9 March 2008, Juppé was reelected as Mayor of Bordeaux, winning 56% of the popular vote in the first round.

=== Back in government (2010–2012) === 
In 2010, after the disappointed result of the regional elections of the ruling UMP, Nicolas Sarkozy called Alain Juppé to come back in government. Juppé refused the Justice Ministry and Interior Ministry. He accepted to be Minister of Defense.

In 2011, after the resignation of Michèle Alliot-Marie, Juppé was appointed Foreign Minister. This came while the Arab Spring was underway. He advocated a military intervention in Libya with the support of most of the mediatic and political class. In November 2011, he told that the Syrian regime would fall soon and that Bashar al-Assad should be judged by the International Penal court. Later, this attitude has been condemned or badly evaluated by experts or politicians, estimating that the destabilization of nation-states has permitted the extension of Islamic extremism, but Juppé has maintained his positions.

Endorsing Nicolas Sarkozy for the 2012 presidential election, he deplored the role of biased media in the campaign and dismissed François Hollande&#x27;s economic program as &quot;dangerous&quot;. Considering the weak score of Sarkozy in his Gironde&#x27;s 2nd constituency, he renounced to be candidate at the June 2012 legislative elections. His successor, Nicolas Florian, was beaten by Socialist candidate Michèle Delaunay.

=== Presidential ambition (2012–2016) ===


After the 2012 defeat, Juppé stayed far from the troubled period of his party. In March 2014, he was triumphantly re-elected as mayor of Bordeaux. Two months later, following the resignation of Jean-François Copé from the head of the UMP, it was announced that former Prime Ministers Alain Juppé, François Fillon and Jean-Pierre Raffarin would rule the party until a new leadership election in October. They resigned after the designation of Nicolas Sarkozy.

Juppé announced his intention to contest the 2016 Republicans (formerly UMP) internal election which decided who would be the candidate of the right-wing for the 2017 presidential election. One of the most popular politicians in France, he was described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;a consensual conservative seen as less divisive than Nicolas Sarkozy&quot;. His main rival was thought to be Nicolas Sarkozy who chose to run on a hard line to thwart Juppé&#x27;s centrist line. Indeed, Juppé advocated a &quot;happy identity&quot; in response to the French philosopher Alain Finkielkraut whose last book was entitled &quot;The unhappy identity&quot;. He was endorsed by former President Jacques Chirac and his daughter Claude, by MoDem leader François Bayrou and by centrist parties such as the Radical Party or the UDI. Surveys showed that he would benefit from the support of left-wing voters.

His record as mayor of Bordeaux was often seen as one of his strengths in the primary. However, his judicial conviction and his record as prime minister of France attracted criticism, as well as his positions on immigration and Islam, mainly in the right wing of his party. Some detractors have dubbed him &quot;Ali Juppé&quot;.

Juppé came in second place in the first Republican presidential primary on 20 November 2016 and went into a run-off against the first-placed François Fillon on 27 November. He received 28.6% of the vote compared to 44.1% for François Fillon. One week later, he lost to Fillon with 33.5% and officially supported his rival. This result was viewed as a shock as Juppé had been the consistent front-runner in the polls.

===Constitutional Council (2019)===
On 13 February 2019, it was announced that Juppé would take over Lionel Jospin&#x27;s seat on the &quot;Conseil Constitutionnel&quot; in March 2019, which entailed his resignation as mayor of Bordeaux and president of its metropolitan area. At the press conference organized the following day, the former prime minister lamented an &quot;unhealthy public spirit&quot; and the physical and verbal violence of the political environment.

== Political positions ==

=== Social issues ===

In March 2009, he criticized Pope Benedict XVI over his comments that condoms will only worsen the AIDS crisis, saying that as a Christian, he felt that such declarations were totally unacceptable. He was also awarded on behalf of Armenia the Mesrob Mashdots Medal for his service in strengthening and deepening the cooperation between the governments of Armenia and France.

=== European Union ===
Juppé&#x27;s position on Europe has changed through years. In 1977, as a national delegate of the neo-Gaullist RPR, he advocated a &quot;Europe of the peoples&quot; against a &quot;Europe of technocrats&quot;, opposing the confederal model to the federal model.

But fifteen years later, he convinced Jacques Chirac to agree to the Maastricht Treaty, while the party was strongly divided on the subject. He then said that the treaty was &quot;common sense&quot; and that the Euro is &quot;a strategy for growth&quot;. In 2000, he co-signed a tribune in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; with Jacques Toubon asking for a European constitution to create a federal Europe. In 2011, he seemed to regret his positions, declaring at the National Assembly &quot;If the Maastricht Treaty had been better built, we would probably not be where we are now&quot;. But the same year, interviewed on the public television channel France 2, Juppé strongly advocated for the creation of a European federation to respond to the euro crisis.

During the Greek debt crisis in 2015, he proposed to take out Greece of the Eurozone but then changed his mind. Reacting to the Brexit vote in 2016, he refused the idea of a similar referendum in France, thinking it would be &quot;a present to Madame Le Pen&quot;.

=== Immigration and Islam===
In 1977, he proposed granting preferential status for jobs to French citizens. In 1990, he judged that immigration was &quot;a permanent and huge&quot; problem. The same year, the general meeting of the RPR led to strict propositions : borders closing, suspension of immigration, and declarations of the incompatibility between Islam and French laws. 

His position changed in the late 1990s. He supported a MEDEF report asking for more immigration on the labour market. In 2002, he said &quot;the French peoples have perfectly understood that we need to welcome more foreigners in Europe and in France&quot;. He has also denied the effectiveness of a cultural assimilation of migrants and advocates a simple integration, wanting to &quot;happy identity&quot;. His positions are harshly criticized by the right-wing part of his party and by the National Front. Nicolas Sarkozy have mocked him as a naïve idealist and a &quot;prophet of happiness&quot;.

On 16 December 2010, he said in an interview with &quot;Le Monde&quot; that he does not support the French ban on face covering to not &quot;stigmatize Islam&quot;. Hosted on France 2 by journalist David Pujadas on 2 October 2014, he denied having said that. In a 2011 &quot;Le Parisien&quot; interview, talking about the Arab Spring, he declared: &quot;Do not stigmatize all those who call themselves islamists, there are people attached to Islam and ready to accept the basic laws of democracy&quot;.

In October 2016 during a speech he urged overhaul of Le Touquet Agreement calling for the UK border to be moved from Calais to Kent.

<text>Édouard Balladur (; born 2 May 1929) is a French politician who served as Prime Minister of France under François Mitterrand from 29 March 1993 to 17 May 1995. He unsuccessfully ran for president in the 1995 French presidential election, coming in third place.

==Biography==
Balladur was born in İzmir, Turkey, to a Levantine family of Armenian ancestry, with longstanding ties to France. The family with five children emigrated to Marseille in the mid-to-late 1930s.

In 1957, Balladur married Marie-Josèphe Delacour, with whom he had four sons.

===Early political career===
Balladur started his political career in 1964 as an advisor to Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. After Pompidou&#x27;s election as President of France in 1969, Balladur was appointed under-secretary general of the presidency then secretary general from 1973 to Pompidou&#x27;s death in 1974.

Balladur returned to politics in the 1980s as a supporter of Jacques Chirac. A member of the Neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) party, he was the theoretician behind the &quot;cohabitation government&quot; from 1986 to 1988, explaining that if the right won the legislative election, it could govern with Chirac as prime minister without Socialist Party President François Mitterrand&#x27;s resignation. As Minister of Economy and Finance, he implemented a liberal economic policy reminiscent of the one attributed to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. He thus implemented a major privatisation programme, involving several companies nationalised in 1945 and 1982, such as the Compagnie Financière de Suez, Paribas and the Société Générale. He also privatised TF1. He also reduced the number of civil servants and state expenditure.

Balladur appeared as an unofficial deputy prime minister in the cabinet led by Chirac. He took a major part in the adoption of liberal and pro-European policies by Chirac and the RPR. After Chirac&#x27;s defeat at the 1988 presidential election, part of the RPR held him responsible of the abandonment of Gaullist doctrine, but he kept the confidence of Chirac.

===Prime minister===
When the RPR/UDF coalition won the 1993 legislative election, Chirac declined to become prime minister again in a second &quot;cohabitation&quot; with President Mitterrand, and Balladur became prime minister. He was faced with a difficult economic situation, but he did not want to make the political errors of the previous cohabitation government. He continued the economic policy he had undertaken in 1986 by carrying out new privatisations (notably Rhône-Poulenc, Banque Nationale de Paris and Elf). Conveying the image of a quiet conservative, he did not question the wealth tax (reestablished by the Socialists in 1988). 

Balladur disagreed with François Mitterrand by considering that nuclear tests were necessary to maintain the credibility of the French deterrent.

Despite corruption affairs affecting some of his ministers, who he forced to resign (thus lending his name to the so-called &quot;Balladur jurisprudence&quot;), he had the support of influential media.

===1995 presidential election===
When he became prime minister, Balladur had promised Chirac that he would not enter the 1995 presidential election, and that he would support Chirac&#x27;s candidacy. However, a number of right-wing politicians advised Balladur to run for the presidency in 1995. He went back on his promise to Chirac and entered the campaign. When he announced his candidacy, four months before the election, he was considered the favourite. In the polls, he led Chirac by almost 20 points. However, from the position of an outsider, Chirac criticized Balladur as representing &quot;dominant ideas&quot;, and the gap in the polls decreased quickly. The revelation of a bugging scandal which implicated Balladur also contributed to a drop in his popularity among voters.

In the first round of the election, Balladur finished in third place with 18.6% of the vote behind the Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin and Chirac. He was thus eliminated from the final run-off election between the top two candidates, which Chirac won.

Chirac immediately appointed Alain Juppé to replace Balladur as prime minister. Despite Chirac declaring that he and Balladur had been &quot;friends for 30 years&quot;, Balladur&#x27;s decision to stand against him greatly strained their relationship. As a result, the &quot;Balladuriens&quot; who had supported him in the presidential election, such as Nicolas Sarkozy, were ostracized from the new Chirac administration.

===Later political career===
Balladur failed to win the elections for the presidency of the Île-de-France region in 1998, the RPR nomination for the mayoralty of Paris in 2001, and the Chair of the National Assembly in 2002. He presided over the National Assembly&#x27;s foreign affairs committee during his last parliamentary term (2002–2007). Since the 1980s, he had advocated the unification of the right-wing groupings into a single large party, but it was Chirac who managed the feat, with the creation of the Union for a Popular Movement in 2002.

Following the 2007 French presidential election, Nicolas Sarkozy nominated Balladur to the head of a committee for institutional reforms. The constitutional revision was approved by the Parliament in July 2008.

From 1968 to 1980, Balladur was president of the French company of the Mont Blanc Tunnel while occupying various other positions in ministerial staff. Following the 1999 deadly accident in the tunnel, he gave evidence to the court judging the case in 2005 about the security measures he had or had not taken. Balladur claimed that he always took security seriously, but that it was difficult to agree on anything with the Italian company operating the Italian part of the tunnel. From 1977 to 1986, he was president of &quot;Générale de Service Informatique&quot; (later merged into IBM Global Services), making him one of the few French politicians with business experience.

In 2006, he announced that he would not run again for re-election in 2007 as a member of Parliament for the 15th &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Paris, a conservative stronghold.

In 2008, Balladur visited the United States to speak at an event organized by the Streit Council, a Washington-based think tank. Balladur presented his latest book, in which he outlined a concept for a &quot;Union of the West&quot;.

Balladur is often caricatured as aloof, aristocratic, and arrogant in media, such as the &quot;Canard Enchaîné&quot; weekly or the &quot;Les Guignols de l&#x27;info&quot; TV show. Incidentally, the percentage of French government ministers who were also members of Le Siècle peaked at 72% under Balladur&#x27;s Prime Ministership (1993–95).

==&quot;Karachi affair&quot;==
Investigative forensic accounting enabled by the leaked Panama Papers revealed aspects of the Karachi affair, also dubbed &quot;Karachigate&quot;, with the Ministry of Justice examining whether armament contract commissions paid by Saudi Arabia, then Pakistan, financed the 1995 presidential campaigns of Balladur or Chirac, whose administration then succeeded in taking office. In May 2017, Balladur and his former Defence Minister François Léotard were each charged, in relation to the Pakistan deal, with &quot;complicity in misuse of corporate assets and concealment&quot;. In June 2019, Balladur&#x27;s former campaign manager, Nicolas Bazire, was one of six men convicted over the arms deal, and was sentenced to three years imprisonment for using &quot;illegal funds&quot; in Balladur&#x27;s 1995 campaign. On 4 March 2021, Édouard Balladur was acquitted by the Court of Justice of the Republic, a special court that tries members of the government for actions performed in the exercise of their functions.

<text>Giuliano Amato (; born 13 May 1938) is an Italian politician who twice served as Prime Minister of Italy, first from 1992 to 1993 and again from 2000 to 2001. Upon Arnaldo Forlani&#x27;s death in July 2023, Amato became the country&#x27;s earliest-serving surviving Prime Minister.

Later, he was Vice President of the Convention on the Future of Europe that drafted the European Constitution and headed the Amato Group. He is commonly nicknamed &quot;dottor Sottile&quot;, which means &quot;Doctor Subtilis&quot;, the sobriquet of the Scottish Medieval philosopher John Duns Scotus, a reference to his political subtlety. From 2006 to 2008, he was the Minister of the Interior in Romano Prodi&#x27;s government. He served on the Constitutional Court of Italy from September 2013 to September 2022, to which he was appointed by President Giorgio Napolitano. He also served as President of the Court from 29 January 2022 to 18 September 2022.

==Biography==
Born in Turin into a Sicilian family, Amato grew up in Tuscany. He received a first degree in law from the University of Pisa in 1960 while attending the prestigious Collegio Medico-Giuridico of the Scuola Normale Superiore, which today is Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies. As a Fulbright grantee, he received a master&#x27;s degree in comparative law from Columbia Law School in 1963. After teaching at the Universities of Modena, Perugia and Florence, he worked as professor of Italian and Comparative Constitutional Law at the University of Rome La Sapienza from 1975 to 1997.

Amato began his political career in 1958 when he joined the Italian Socialist Party. He was a Member of Parliament from 1983 to 1993. He was Undersecretary of State to the Prime Minister&#x27;s office from 1983 to 1987, Deputy Prime Minister from 1987 to 1988, and Minister for the Treasury from 1987 to 1989.

From June 1992 to April 1993, Amato served as prime minister. During those ten months, a series of corruption scandals rocked Italy and swept away almost an entire class of political leaders. Amato himself was never implicated, notwithstanding how close he was to Bettino Craxi, a central figure in the corruption system.

As prime minister, Amato responded effectively to two devaluations of the lira in the wake of currency speculation that led Italy to be expelled from the European Monetary System by cutting the budget deficit drastically, thus taking the first steps in the road that would bring Italy to adopt the Euro.

At a point, his government was harshly contested because of a decree that suddenly moved the competence for corruption investigations into the hands of the police, which, being controlled directly by the government, would have not been independent. Fearing that the new system would have effectively blocked investigations of political corruption, Italians took to the streets in massive, spontaneous rallies. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refused to sign the decree, deeming it blatantly unconstitutional. While his justice minister Giovanni Conso took the blame, it has been disputed whether Amato was a victim of circumstances or whether he wanted to save the corruption-ridden system.

At the end of his period as prime minister, Amato gave a speech to the Parliament in which he solemnly promised that at the end of his term, he would retire from politics, stressing that his was a true commitment and that he would not break this promise as some politicians (whom he characterized as &quot;mandarins&quot;) used to do. However, this promise was short-lived; Amato has regularly come under criticism for having made such a solemn commitment and failing to keep it.

Amato was President of the Italian antitrust authority from November 1994 to December 1997, Minister for Institutional Reforms in Massimo D&#x27;Alema&#x27;s first government from October 1998 to May 1999, and, once again, Treasury Minister in D&#x27;Alema&#x27;s second government from December 1999 to April 2000. Amato was nearly nominated for the Presidency of the Republic and was a close contender to replace Michel Camdessus as head of the International Monetary Fund.

Amato served as prime minister again from April 2000 to May 2001. He promoted economic competitiveness as well as social protection. In addition to economic reforms, he pushed ahead with political and institutional reforms, trying to deal with a weak executive and fragmented legislature.

In December 2001, European Union leaders at the European Council in Laeken appointed Amato and former Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to be Vice Presidents of the Convention on the Future of Europe to assist former French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing in the drafting of the new European Constitution. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002.

Amato was a Member of the Senate representing the constituency of Grosseto in Tuscany from 2001 to 2006. In 2006, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Olive Tree list, and he was named Minister of the Interior in Romano Prodi&#x27;s centre-left government.

Since 2010, he also leads advanced seminar classes at the Master in International Public Affairs of the LUISS School of Government.

On 12 September 2013, President Giorgio Napolitano appointed Amato as judge on the Constitutional Court of Italy, where he has served since then. On 16 September 2020 Amato ran for the position of President of the Constitutional Court, but lost in the second round of voting against Mario Rosario Morelli who obtained nine votes, while Giancarlo Coraggio obtained five and Amato received one. He was subsequently made Vice President by Morelli. He was confirmed in this position by Coraggio who became president in December 2020.

Amato is married to Diana Vincenzi, a professor of Family Law at the University of Rome. They have two children, Elisa and Lorenzo, and five grandchildren, Giulia, Marco, Simone, Elena and Irene. As of September 2020, Amato is a member of the Italian Aspen Institute.

==World Justice Project==
Giuliano Amato serves as an Honorary Co-chair for the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the Rule of Law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.

==President of Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies==
In 2012 Giuliano Amato was appointed as President of the Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies. As alumnus of Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies (attending the prestigious Collegio Medico-Giuridico of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, which today is Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies), he guarded close contact with the university, previously heading &quot;Sant&#x27;Anna Alumni Association&quot;.

He was appointed as President of the Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies on 21 February 2012 by the Academic Senate of Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies and by a Decree of the Minister Francesco Profumo of the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy). He resigned from his post at the Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies after being appointed to the Constitutional Court in September 2013.

== Personal views ==
In 2011, Amato declared that Italian creativity is not supported by adequate efficiency in organising its public and private entities. He believes it had a role in the lost hope in the future and in the sense of a common national identity, as well as it had not been yet perfectioned as a whole in a way that was congruent with its essence. That loss had favoured the flourishing of xenophobia and purported regional identities, such as the Lega Nord movement.

Amato thinks that the brigandage in Southern Italy after 1861 was an unfair and unlawful movement that cannot be seen as a form of antinational rebellion; however, the soldiers and the officials of the Borbonic Army who joined the movement cannot be defined as betrayers of the ongoing Italy. It is also not credible that the Expedition of the Thousand could have caused the annexation of the Southern Italy to the Kingdom of Sardinia by itself, while the main political and cultural foundations had been thrown by the works of intellectuals like Francesco Mario Pagano and Vincenzo Cuoco produced in the 1790s. If he did not believe the national identity is always something more important than sub-national or sovran-national ones, Amato believes in the multi-layer identities model proposed by Alberto Banti in a way for which the European identity strengthens the Italian identity even when they live and work in a foreign country. According to him, the Italian identity is kept alive in any country in which they should have gone.

<doc id="434937" wikidata="Q271148" url="?curid=434937" title="King of Italy">
<text>King of Italy (; ) was the title given to the ruler of the Kingdom of Italy after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The first to take the title was Odoacer, a barbarian warlord, in the late 5th century, followed by the Ostrogothic kings up to the mid-6th century. With the Frankish conquest of Italy in the 8th century, the Carolingians assumed the title, which was maintained by subsequent Holy Roman Emperors throughout the Middle Ages. The last Emperor to claim the title was Charles V in the 16th century. During this period, the holders of the title were crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.

A Kingdom of Italy was restored from 1805 to 1814 with Napoleon as its only king, centred in Northern Italy. It was not until the Italian unification in the 1860s that an independent Kingdom of Italy covering the entire Italian Peninsula was restored. From 1861 the House of Savoy held the title of &quot;King of Italy&quot; until the last king, Umberto II, was exiled in 1946 when Italy became a republic.

==History==
After the deposition of the last Western Emperor in 476, Heruli leader Odoacer was appointed &quot;Dux Italiae&quot; (Duke of Italy) by the reigning Byzantine Emperor Zeno. Later, the Germanic &quot;foederati,&quot; the Scirians and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, proclaimed Odoacer (&#x27;King of Italy). In 493, the Ostrogothic king Theoderic the Great killed Odoacer, and set up a new dynasty of kings of Italy. Ostrogothic rule ended when Italy was reconquered by the Byzantine Empire in 552.

In 568, the Lombards entered the peninsula and ventured to recreate a barbarian kingdom in opposition to the Empire, establishing their authority over much of Italy, except the Exarchate of Ravenna and the duchies of Rome, Venetia, Naples and the southernmost portions. In the 8th century, estrangement between the Italians and the Byzantines allowed the Lombards to capture the remaining Roman enclaves in northern Italy. However, in 774, they were defeated by the Franks under Charlemagne, who deposed their king and took up the title &quot;king of the Lombards&quot;. After the death of Charles the Fat in 887, Italy fell into instability and a number of kings attempted to establish themselves as independent Italian monarchs. During this period, known as the Feudal Anarchy (888–962), the title &quot;Rex Italicorum&quot; (&quot;King of the Italians&quot; or &quot;King of the Italics&quot;) was introduced. After the breakup of the Frankish Empire, Otto I added Italy to the Holy Roman Empire and continued the use of the title &quot;Rex Italicorum&quot;. The last to use this title was Henry II (1004–1024). Subsequent emperors used the title &quot;King of Italy&quot; until Charles V. They were crowned in Pavia, Milan and Bologna.

In 1805, Napoleon I was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy at the Milan Cathedral. The next year, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II abdicated his imperial title. From the deposition of Napoleon I (1814) until the Italian Unification (1861), there was no Italian monarch claiming the overarching title. The &quot;Risorgimento&quot; successfully established the House of Savoy dynasty over the whole peninsula and, uniting the kingdoms of Sardinia and the Two Sicilies, it formed the modern Kingdom of Italy. The monarchy was superseded by the Italian Republic, after a constitutional referendum was held on 2 June 1946, after World War II. The Italian monarchy formally ended on 12 June of that year and Umberto II left the country.

==As &quot;Kingdom of Odoacer&quot;==

Initially named &quot;Dux Italiae&quot; (Duke of Italy) by Zeno, the Roman Emperor in Constantinople, he later was recognized as King of Italy by the &quot;foederati&quot; in control of the Italian peninsula. He was deposed by the Ostrogoths, who established their own kingdom.

* Odoacer (476–493)

==Ostrogothic Kingdom (493–553)==

Theodoric the Great was invited by the emperor Zeno to take Italy from Odoacer and rule it in Zeno&#x27;s name. He defeated Odoacer in 493, establishing a new kingdom in place of Odoacer&#x27;s. Officially, the Ostrogothic kings ruled the Roman citizens in Italy as a viceroy of the Roman emperors, and their own Gothic people as their king, though functionally they ran their kingdom entirely independently from the Roman authority in Constantinople. Their greatest extent was during Theodoric&#x27;s reign; as Roman Emperors from the east began to exert more power and retake control of Roman territory, the last Ostrogothic king fell to the Emperor Justinian in 553.

* Theodoric the Great (493–526)
* Athalaric (526–534)
* Queen Amalasuintha (534–535)
* Theodahad (534–536)
* Witiges (536–540)
* Ildibad (540–541)
* Eraric (541)
* Totila (541–552)
* Teia (552–553)

==Interregnum (553–568)==

Roman authority in Italy was briefly re-established under Justinian, though his gains were lost under his successor Justin II, after a new Germanic tribe, the Lombards, invaded from the north and established their kingdom in 568.

*Justinian I (553–565) (as Roman Emperor) 
*Justin II (565–568) (as Roman Emperor)

==Kingdom of the Lombards (568–814)==

The Lombards under Alboin established their kingdom in the extreme north of Italy in 568, gradually pushing the Byzantine Romans back from the peninsula until only the Exarchate of Ravenna remained under Roman control. This finally fell in the 750s, with the Lombards gaining control of most of the peninsula. The last Lombard King of Italy, Desiderius, was deposed by his son-in-law Charlemagne, who folded it into the larger Carolingian Empire, which evolved over time into the Holy Roman Empire.

* Alboin (568–572)
* Cleph (572–574)
* Rule of the dukes (ten-year interregnum)
* Authari (584–590)
* Agilulf (591 – )
* Adaloald ()
* Arioald ( – 636)
* Rothari (636–652)
* Rodoald (652–653)
* Aripert I (653–661)
* Perctarit and Godepert (661–662)
* Grimoald (662–671)
* Garibald (671)
* Perctarit (671–688), restored from exile
* Alahis (688–689), rebel
* Cunincpert (688–700)
* Liutpert (700–701)
* Raginpert (701)
* Aripert II (701–712)
* Ansprand (712)
* Liutprand (712–744)
* Hildeprand (744)
* Ratchis (744–749)
* Aistulf (749–756)
* Desiderius (756–774)

==Kingdom of Italy (781–962)==

===Carolingian Dynasty (774–887)===

Charlemagne ruled over northern Italy as King of the Lombards. In 781, he named his son Pepin as King of Italy, though he still maintained suzerainty over the land. Charlemagne was crowned Roman Emperor in 800, while the Kingdom of Italy became one of the constituent kingdoms of the Empire. Beginning with Louis the Pious in 818, the Kingdom was ruled directly by the Carolingian Emperor himself.

* Charlemagne as King of the Lombards (774–814) and Roman Emperor (800–814) 
* Pepin (781–810)
* Bernard (810–818)
* Louis I (818–822)
* Lothair I (822–855)
* Louis II (844–875)
* Charles II the Bald (875–877)
* Carloman (877–879)
* Charles III the Fat (879–887)

===Instability (888–962)===

After 887, Italy fell into instability, with many rulers claiming the kingship simultaneously:

* Berengar I (887–896), vassal of the German King Arnulf of Carinthia, reduced to Friuli (889–894), deposed by Arnulf in 896.
* Guy of Spoleto (889–894), opponent of Berengar, ruled most of Italy but was deposed by Arnulf.
* Lambert of Spoleto (891–896), subking of his father Guy before 894, reduced to Spoleto (894–895).
* Arnulf of Carinthia (894–899)
* Ratold, sub-king (896)

In 896, Arnulf and Ratold lost control of Italy, which was divided between Berengar and Lambert:
* Berengar I (896–924), seized Lambert&#x27;s portion upon the latter&#x27;s death in 898.
* Lambert of Spoleto (896–898)
* Louis III of Provence (900–905), opposed Berengar in 900–902 and 905.
* Rudolph II of Burgundy (922–933), defeated Berengar but fled Italy in 926.
* Hugh of Arles (926–947), elected by Berengar&#x27;s partisans in 925, resigned to Provence after 945.
* Lothair II of Arles (945–950)
* Berengar II of Ivrea, jointly with his son Adalbert of Ivrea (950–961)

In 951 Otto I invaded Italy and was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy. In 952, Berengar and Adalbert became his vassals but remained kings until being deposed by Otto.

==Holy Roman Empire (962–1556)==
Otto is considered to be the founding emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Kingdom of Italy was considered one of the constituent realms of the Empire. Beginning in the 12th century, states such as the Republic of Venice and the Papal States captured more and more territory from the Kingdom of Italy, and the Empire&#x27;s territory on the Peninsula shrunk over time. After Charles V, the emperors stopped being crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy and the Italian title fell into disuse. Imperial control in Italy receded to Trent and South Tyrol until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806. Southern Italy had never been part of the Holy Roman Empire; it remained initially under the control of various Byzantine fiefs until the Norman Kingdom of Sicily (later the Kingdom of Naples) took control of the area in the 11th century. Central Italy, along the Rome-Ravenna axis, was part of the Papal States, under the direct personal rule of the pope. The Duke of Savoy was &quot;de jure&quot; a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor, with the Duke being Prince and Perpetual Vicar of the Holy Roman Empire.

===Ottonian dynasty (962–1024)===
===Salian dynasty (1027–1125)===
===Süpplingenburg dynasty (1125–1137)===
===House of Hohenstaufen (1128–1197)===
===House of Welf (1208–1212)===
===House of Hohenstaufen (1212–1254)===
===House of Luxembourg (1311–1313)===
===House of Wittelsbach (1327–1347)===
===House of Luxembourg (1355–1437)===
===House of Habsburg (1437–1556)===
Charles V was the last emperor to be crowned king of Italy or to officially use the title. The Habsburg emperors claimed the Italian crown until 1801. The empire continued to include Italian territories until its dissolution in 1806.

==Kingdom of Italy as a client state of France, House of Bonaparte (1805–1814)==
In 1805, Napoleon established a client state in northern Italy, named the Kingdom of Italy. He established himself as King of Italy, in personal union with his role as Emperor of the French. This client state did not survive the end of the Napoleonic era; in its place, the Congress of Vienna established a number of independent duchies and kingdoms in the region.

===Full title===
This title is present in Italian laws proclaimed by Napoleon I:

[Name], by the Grace of God and the Constitutions, Emperor of the French and King of Italy.

==Kingdom of Italy, House of Savoy (1861–1946)==

During and after the Revolutions of 1848, sentiment on the peninsula grew for the establishment of a unified Italian kingdom. Southern Italy had not been united with northern Italy since the early medieval period, being mostly under the rule of the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Northern Italy, in the early 19th century, came under the domination of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which besides its namesake island, also ruled the expansive Piedmont and Savoy regions along the French-Italian borderlands. The formerly republican leader in southern Italy, Giuseppe Garibaldi, made common cause with the House of Savoy to overthrow the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and the people voted in a plebiscite to join Sardinia to form the Kingdom of Italy in 1861; the Papal States and the city of Rome were annexed to the Kingdom in 1870, completing the Unification of Italy. This kingdom lasted until the aftermath of World War II, when the 1946 Italian institutional referendum ended the monarchy.

===Full title===

Up until the dissolution of the monarchy in 1946, the full titles of the Kings of the Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946) were:

<text>An afterpiece is a short, usually humorous one-act playlet or musical work following the main attraction, the full-length play, and concluding the theatrical evening. This short comedy, farce, opera or pantomime was a popular theatrical form in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was presented to lighten the five-act tragedy that was commonly performed.

A similar piece preceding the main attraction is a curtain raiser.

An example is &quot;The Padlock&quot; by Charles Dibdin, first performed in London in 1768.

<text>Moshe &quot;Bogie&quot; Ya&#x27;alon (; born Moshe Smilansky; 24 June 1950) is an Israeli politician and former Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, who also served as Israel&#x27;s Defense Minister under Benjamin Netanyahu from 2013 until his resignation on 20 May 2016. Ya&#x27;alon ran for Knesset in 2019 as the number three member of the Blue and White party, a joint list created by the merging of the Israel Resilience Party, led by former IDF chief of staff Benny Gantz, and Yesh Atid, led by Yair Lapid. Ya&#x27;alon briefly served as the number 2 on the Yesh Atid-Telem list that was created following the 2020 Israeli legislative election. Ya&#x27;alon retired from politics in the lead up to the 2021 election after testing the waters by splitting his Telem party from Yesh Atid.

==Early life ==
Ya&#x27;alon was born Moshe Smilansky, the son of David Smilansky and Batya Silber. His father, a factory worker, had moved to Mandatory Palestine with his parents from Soviet Ukraine in 1925, and was a veteran of the Haganah and Jewish Brigade. His mother was a Holocaust survivor from Galicia who had fought against the Nazis with partisans during World War II. She came to Palestine in 1946. Ya&#x27;alon grew up in Kiryat Haim, a working-class suburb of Haifa. He was active in the Labor Zionist youth movement &quot;HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed&quot; and joined a Nahal group named Ya&#x27;alon, a name he later adopted. He later moved to kibbutz Grofit, in the Arava region near Eilat, where he worked in the cowshed and as a tractor operator.

==Military career==
In 1968, Ya&#x27;alon was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces, and volunteered as a paratrooper in the Paratroopers Brigade. He served as a soldier and a squad leader in the brigade&#x27;s 50 battalion and fought in the War of Attrition. He was discharged in 1971.

In 1973, he was called up as a reservist during the Yom Kippur War. On 15 October 1973, his unit, the 55th Paratroopers Brigade, became the first IDF unit to cross the Suez Canal into mainland Egypt. He continued fighting as part of the Israeli drive into the Egyptian mainland; he participated in the encirclement of the Egyptian Third Army. Following the war, he rejoined the IDF as a career soldier, and became an infantry officer after completing Officer Candidate School. He then returned to the Paratroopers Brigade as a platoon leader. Later on he served as a company commander in the brigade&#x27;s 50 battalion and led the brigade&#x27;s Reconnaissance company in several special operations and during Operation Litani.

During the 1982 Lebanon War, Ya&#x27;alon joined the Sayeret Matkal commando unit as a commander. He then rejoined the Paratroopers Brigade and was appointed as the commander of its 890 &quot;Efe&quot; (Echis) paratroop battalion. During this time, he was wounded in the leg while leading a pursuit of Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon.

Ya&#x27;alon took a sabbatical to the United Kingdom to study at the British Army&#x27;s Camberley Staff College. Upon his return to Israel, he was promoted to the rank of colonel and appointed commander of Sayeret Matkal. Ya&#x27;alon led it to many notable achievements, for which the unit received four recommendations of honor. After his tenure as commander was finished, Ya&#x27;alon studied at the University of Haifa, obtaining a BA in Political Science, and took an Armored Corps course. In 1990, Ya&#x27;alon was appointed commander of the Paratroopers Brigade, and two years later, became commander of the Judea and Samaria Division. On 10 December 1992, Ya&#x27;alon killed a militant from the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine with a hand grenade after the militant had shot dead a Yamam operative attempting to arrest him. In 1993, he was appointed commander of an IDF training base, and commander of an armored division. In 1995, Ya&#x27;alon was promoted to major general and appointed head of Military Intelligence. In 1998, he was appointed commanding officer of Israel&#x27;s Central Command. He was serving in this position when the Second Intifada was launched in September 2000.

Ya&#x27;alon was appointed Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on 9 July 2002, and served in that position until 1 June 2005. The major focus throughout his tenure as chief of staff was the army&#x27;s effort to quell the Second Intifada. Under his watch, the IDF conducted Operation Defensive Shield.

In February 2005, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz decided not to extend Ya&#x27;alon&#x27;s service as chief of staff for another year. This marked the climax of tensions between Mofaz and Ya&#x27;alon, which had arisen partly through Ya&#x27;alon&#x27;s objection to the Gaza disengagement plan. On 1 June 2005, Ya&#x27;alon retired from the army, and Dan Halutz, his successor as chief of staff, oversaw the disengagement.

In December 2005, relatives of the victims of the 1996 shelling of Qana filed a suit against Ya&#x27;alon in Washington, D.C., for his alleged role in their deaths. In late 2006, while Ya&#x27;alon was in New Zealand on a private fund-raising trip for the Jewish National Fund, Auckland District Court judge Avinash Deobhakta issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes arising from his role in the 2002 assassination of Hamas commander Salah Shehade, who was killed in a targeted assassination, when an Israeli warplane bombed his home in Gaza City. About 14 Palestinian civilians were also killed in the airstrike. Deobhakta stated that New Zealand had an obligation to prosecute him under the Geneva Convention. Attorney-General Michael Cullen ordered a stay in the warrant after advice from the Crown Law office that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute, and the warrant was cancelled after Ya&#x27;alon left New Zealand.

He was appointed Minister of Defense on 17 March 2013. During his tenure, the IDF conducted Operation Protective Edge. He resigned on 20 May 2016, citing &quot;difficult disagreements on moral and professional matters&quot; with prime minister Netanyahu and warning that &quot;extreme and dangerous elements have taken over Israel and the Likud Party&quot;.

==Political career==

Ya&#x27;alon backed the Oslo Accords, but later he &quot;admitted his mistake.&quot; On 17 November 2008, Ya&#x27;alon announced that he was joining Likud and that he would participate in the primaries which would determine the Likud candidates for the 2009 elections. He won eighth place on the party&#x27;s list, and entered the Knesset as Likud won 27 seats. Upon the formation of the Netanyahu government, he was appointed Vice Prime Minister (alongside Silvan Shalom) and Minister of Strategic Affairs. In March 2013, he replaced Ehud Barak as Defense Minister.

In January 2015, the leader of Lehava anti-assimilation group, Ben-Zion Gopstein, voiced harsh criticism against Ya&#x27;alon after Channel 2 reported that he was expected to categorize Lehava as a terrorist organization. Ya&#x27;alon ordered the Shin Bet and the Defense Ministry to assemble evidence required for the classification. Lehava promotes the ideology of the late Jewish Defense League leader Meir Kahane. Three members of Lehava were arrested and indicted in 2014 for committing arson and spray-painting anti-Arab graffiti at the Max Rayne Hand in Hand (Yad B&#x27;Yad) Bilingual School in Jerusalem and Lehava&#x27;s leader Ben Zion Gopstein along with other group members were arrested shortly thereafter for incitement. The arson incident received international attention. Gopstein said &quot;I suggest that [Ya&#x27;alon] aim to outlaw the Islamist Movement and then preoccupy itself with an anti-assimilation group... Instead of taking care of an enemy of Israel, the defense minister is trying to win over votes from the Left [by] taking on Lehava. The group acts to save the daughters of Israel [Jewish women] and deserves the Israel Prize.&quot;

In February 2015 Ya&#x27;alon took a political stand on gay marriage. In a speech he promised to help promote LGBT rights in Israel, and in particular noted he would support the establishment of civil marriage laws in Israel that would allow same-sex couples to be recognized as a family unit.

Following the 2016 shooting by an Israeli soldier of a wounded Palestinian assailant, Ya&#x27;alon said that the soldier&#x27;s action &quot;completely contradicts IDF values and its battle ethics; even in a moment of great anger we must not permit such unbridled and uncontrolled behavior.&quot; This statement was viewed by many Israelis as prejudging the case.

Ya&#x27;alon formed Telem on 2 January 2019.

On January 29, 2019, Ya&#x27;alon announced a political alliance with former IDF chief of staff Benny Gantz. Ya&#x27;alon was in the number two position on Gantz&#x27;s Israel Resilience Party list. Ya&#x27;alon reiterated his opposition to a &quot;two states for two peoples&quot; solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On 21 February 2019, the Israel Resilience Party and Telem merged with Yesh Atid. Ya&#x27;alon became the number three candidate on the united list, known as the &quot;Blue and White&quot; party. Following the party&#x27;s split after the 2020 Israeli legislative election, Ya&#x27;alon&#x27;s party aligned with Yair Lapid to form the Yesh Atid-Telem alliance and became second in the list.

In the run up to the 2021 Israeli legislative election, Ya&#x27;alon&#x27;s party split from Yesh Atid. After multiple polls showing the party unable to pass the 3.5 percent election threshold, Ya&#x27;alon decided to quit the race.

In 2023, Ya&#x27;alon called the Israeli government a &quot;dictatorship of criminals&quot;, due to the national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir calling on the police to &quot;strike protestors&quot; as well as proposed judicial reforms that would give the government more control over judicial appointments.

In 2024, Ya&#x27;alon accused the Israeli government of committing ethnic cleansings in the Gaza Strip, and said that the IDF is no longer the most moral army in the world.

==Controversial statements==

===Palestinian threat as &#x27;cancer&#x27;===
On 27 August 2002, Ya&#x27;alon told &quot;Haaretz&quot;: &quot;The Palestinian threat harbors cancer-like attributes that have to be severed. There are all kinds of solutions to cancer. Some say it&#x27;s necessary to amputate organs but at the moment I am applying chemotherapy.&quot; The same month he said &quot;the Palestinians must be made to understand in the deepest recesses of their consciousness that they are a defeated people&quot;.

In January 2004, Ya&#x27;alon publicly stated that the thirteen Sayeret Matkal soldiers who refused to serve in the Israeli-occupied territories were taking the unit&#x27;s name in vain.

===Iran===
In January 2008, during a discussion at IDC Herzliya, Ya&#x27;alon said &quot;There is no way to stabilize the situation all over the world and especially in the Middle East without confronting Iran.&quot; According to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; Ya&#x27;alon said: &quot;We have to confront the Iranian revolution immediately. There is no way to stabilize the Middle East today without defeating the Iranian [government]. The Iranian nuclear program must be stopped.&quot; 

When asked whether &quot;all options&quot; included a military deposition of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the rest of Iran&#x27;s current leadership, Ya&#x27;alon told &quot;The Herald&quot;: &quot;We have to consider killing him. All options must be considered.&quot;

===The Peace Now/&#x27;virus&#x27; incident===
In August 2009, Ya&#x27;alon visited the ruins of Homesh, a settlement that was destroyed in Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2005 and toured Israeli settlements in the north of the West Bank, considered as un-authorized outposts. He said that these communities are all legitimate and should not be called &quot;illegal.&quot; In addition, he participated in a convention of Manhigut Yehudit (&quot;Jewish Leadership&quot;), the more right-wing Settlers&#x27; segment within the Likud right-wing Party, in which he condemned the disengagement plan, called Peace Now a &quot;virus&quot; and said that &quot;We become accustomed to Arabs being permitted to live everywhere, in the Negev, Galilee, Nablus, Jenin, and [on the other hand] there are areas where Jews are not allowed to live. We caused this.&quot; He also stated that, &quot;regarding the issue of the settlements, in my opinion Jews can and should live everywhere in the Land of Israel. Now, ... first of all, every settlement needs to get the approval of the authorities, and what goes up on the spot, in contradiction to these decisions and so on is not legitimate. It&#x27;s against the law&quot;.

Later, after meeting with Netanyahu, Ya&#x27;alon retracted parts of his statements and said that he &quot;recognized the importance of democratic discourse and respecting other opinions.&quot; Ya&#x27;alon explained that, indeed, all Israelis want &quot;peace, now&quot;. He stressed, however, the need to accept the fact that peace will not come immediately, otherwise it &quot;hurts Israel.&quot; Ya&#x27;alon stated that, in his view, the way of thinking that Israel just needs to give one more piece of land and &quot;then it will have peace&quot; is a kind of &quot;virus.&quot;

===U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. engagement in the peace process===
In January 2014, Ya&#x27;alon was quoted in an Israeli newspaper calling U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry &quot;obsessive&quot; and &quot;messianic,&quot; and claiming that the &quot;only thing that can save us is if Kerry wins the Nobel Prize and leaves us alone.&quot; The remarks attributed to him precipitated a diplomatic row with the U.S. State Department and elicited criticism of members of Israel&#x27;s government. In October 2014, during a visit to the U.S. Ya&#x27;alon met with his counterpart, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, but was denied requests to meet with then-Vice President Joe Biden and Kerry. A U.S. official told &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; that the snub should come as no surprise.

===Segregation of buses===
In October 2014, Ya&#x27;alon supported a plan that would effectively ban Palestinian workers from buses used by Jewish settlers. Ya&#x27;alon said that his plan was based on security needs. The IDF said that there was no security issue with integrated buses given that all West Bank Palestinian workers go through security checkpoints. When Ya&#x27;alon&#x27;s move was criticized as being a form of apartheid, Yehuda Weinstein, Israel&#x27;s Attorney General, demanded that Ya&#x27;alon explain his rationale.

===Resumption of settlement construction===
In late 2014 at a meeting with Jewish settlers on the West Bank who questioned Israel&#x27;s apparent delay in settler construction, Ya&#x27;alon said that settlement construction represented the greatest growth in Israel and with regard to any apparent slowdown, he declared, &quot;It&#x27;s temporary. There is a certain administration now in the United States Obama administration, which is leading this policy. This administration will not stay forever and I hope it&#x27;s temporary.&quot; He commented that it is important for Israel not to antagonize the U.S. at the moment, because American support is needed in countering diplomatic undertakings at the U.N. that he claimed were &quot;anti-Israel.&quot; &quot;The publication of construction plans, even in Jerusalem, draws a response from various bodies, including our friends, that attack us,&quot; he said. But he noted that he very much wanted to approve construction plans. Ya&#x27;alon&#x27;s remarks about not antagonizing the U.S. came at a time when an opinion poll showed that the &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of Israelis believe their country&#x27;s relationship with the U.S. has been hurt as a result of the poor relationship between Obama and Netanyahu. In response to the Ya&#x27;alon&#x27;s remarks, which were broadcast of Israeli Army Radio, a spokesperson for Ya&#x27;alon claimed, &quot;this does not diminish in any way the appreciation and esteem Minister Ya&#x27;alon has for the contribution of the U.S. and its government to the security of Israel and the fact that the U.S. is Israel&#x27;s best friend and strategic anchor.&quot; Responding to the latest of Ya&#x27;alon negative comments about the Obama administration, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, &quot;This administration&#x27;s opposition to settlements is fully consistent with the policies of administrations for decades, including of both parties. So the notion that that would change is not borne out by history.&quot;

=== Israel–Hamas war ===
In an interview on November 30, 2024, Ya&#x27;alon stated, “We are being dragged into annexation and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip.” When asked to clarify his use of the phrase &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and if he believed that was the direction the war was heading, Ya&#x27;alon replied, “Why say ‘heading’? What&#x27;s happening there right now? Beit Lahiya is gone, Beit Hanoun is gone. Operations are underway in Jabalya, essentially clearing the area of Arabs.”

The next day Ya&#x27;alon reasserted his comments during multiple interviews. When speaking about the government during an interview, he stated: “At the end of the day, they’re perpetrating war crimes.”

==Personal life==
Ya&#x27;alon is married with three children. He and his wife live in Modi&#x27;in-Maccabim-Re&#x27;ut, and are still members of Kibbutz Grofit.

<text>Robert &quot;Bob&quot; John Walter (born 30 May 1948) is a British-Turkish Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for North Dorset from 1997 until he stood down at the 2015 general election.

He has been president of the European Security and Defence Association since 2011. He was president of the Berlin Security Conference in 2012, 2013 and 2014, and remains a member of the BSC Steering Board. He was elected President of Eurodefense - United Kingdom in July 2021

==Early life==
Robert Walter was born in 1948; he was educated at Colston&#x27;s School, Bristol, Lord Weymouth&#x27;s School, Warminster, and Aston University, from which he gained a BSc degree in 1971.

Walter&#x27;s political career began as chairman of the Aston University Conservative Association between 1967 and 1969 and chairman of Westbury Constituency Young Conservatives from 1973 until 1976. He was Parliamentary candidate for Bedwellty in 1979.

Prior to his election in 1997, Walter served as chairman of the Conservative Foreign Affairs Forum (1986–88) and chairman of the Conservative Group for Europe (1992–95). He has been a member of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations executive committee (1992–95) and has served as a member of the Carlton Club political committee.

Before entering Parliament in 1997, Walter was an international banker and sheep farmer in Devon. He is a former member of the London Stock Exchange and was a director of Aubrey G Lanston &amp; Co Inc.

==Parliamentary career==
In December 2002, he faced a no-confidence vote, which was overwhelmingly defeated, from a group of Eurosceptics in his local party, over his pro-European views.

In November 2010, Walter was appointed by the prime minister, David Cameron, to head the United Kingdom delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Walter was first appointed as an ordinary member of the assembly in 2002 and has previously chaired its committee dealing with media issues and freedom of the press. He also served for two years as senior vice-chairman of its Economic Affairs and Development Committee. He was elected vice-president of the Parliamentary Assembly and chairman of the European Democrat Group, the third largest political group in the Assembly.

Walter served as chair of the British Group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), 2010–13. He was elected to the executive committee of the IPU in 2014, and was subsequently nominated by that committee as a vice-president of the IPU.

At Westminster, Walter served as a member of the Health Select Committee (1997–99), International Development Committee (2001–03) and the Treasury Committee (2003–05). He was a member of the Conservative 1922 Committee from 2002 to 2005, having previously served as vice-chairman of the Backbench Agriculture Committee (1997–99) and secretary of the European Affairs Committee (1997–2001). From June 1999 to September 2001, he was Conservative frontbench spokesman for Constitutional affairs and for Wales.

In February 2000, he introduced the Sex Discrimination (Amendment) Bill, which failed to make progress. In 2004, he introduced the Restricted Byways Bill, the provisions of which have now been adopted by the Government. His last bill, introduced in 2006, was the House of Commons (Participation) Bill, which proposed to limit the consideration of English business in the House to English MPs (known as EVEL).

From 1997 onwards, he was a member of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly (formerly the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body), and subsequently served as vice-chairman of the Assembly and chairman of its European Affairs Committee.

In 2008, Walter was elected president of the European Security and Defence Assembly, formerly the Assembly of the Western European Union (WEU). He held that post until the WEU was wound up, and the legal basis for the Assembly, the &quot;modified&quot; Brussels Treaty, ended in June 2011.

Walter was blacklisted by Russia as one of 89 European individuals after he condemned the Russian invasion of Crimea and the annexation of Crimea. He also takes a strong interest in the Balkans, Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan. He has publicly defended some of these countries&#x27; democratic progress, and has criticised the Azerbaijani government for its human rights record.

He was a leading member of several All-Party Parliamentary Groups, including vice-chairman of the Human Rights Group and the Prison Health Group. Walter was treasurer of the British Japan, British Caribbean and the Parliamentary Rugby Union groups; he was also vice-commodore of the House of Commons Yacht Club.

<doc id="434960" wikidata="Q4990196" url="?curid=434960" title="Claire Ward">
<text>Claire Margaret Ward (born 9 May 1972) is a British Labour Party politician who was elected Mayor of the East Midlands in May 2024. Previously, she served as Member of Parliament for Watford from 1997 to 2010. Ward was a Government Whip from 2005 to 2009 and a Justice Minister from 2009 to 2010.

==Early life and career==
Ward was born in North Shields, Northumberland, the daughter of Frank and Cathy Ward. Both her parents were Labour Party councillors and her father stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate for Hertsmere at the 1987 general election. She was brought up in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, where she attended the Loreto College, an all-girls Roman Catholic school in St Albans, and studied at the newly created University of Hertfordshire, graduating with a LLB (Law degree) in 1993. She then completed an MA in Britain and the European Union at Brunel University, before qualifying as a solicitor at the College of Law in London. From 1995 to 1998, she was a trainee solicitor.

Ward joined the Labour Party, the Co-operative Party and the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union at the age of fifteen, becoming an active member of Young Labour. In 1990, she won the South East TUC Mike Perkins Memorial Award for Young Trade Unionists before being elected as the Youth Representative on Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee (NEC) the following year.

She was elected as a councillor for Elstree and Borehamwood Town Council in 1994, where she served as Mayor from 1996 to 1997. She stepped down from the Labour Party NEC in 1995 upon her selection as the party&#x27;s candidate for Watford.

==Parliamentary career==

Ward became the MP for Watford at the 1997 general election, succeeding the former Conservative Party Deputy Chief Whip Tristan Garel-Jones, who had retired, and defeating Conservative candidate Robert Gordon by 5,792 votes. Elected at the age of 24, she was not quite the youngest MP, being a month older than Chris Leslie, the new MP for Shipley, although she was the youngest woman elected to the House of Commons. She was also the youngest female MP elected in the 2001 election.

Following her election, Ward became a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. From 2000 to 2002, she was the Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Chocolate and Confectionery Industry Group. In the 2001 general election she retained her seat by 5,555 votes and was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to John Hutton.

The increasing dominance of local politics in Watford Borough council by the Liberal Democrats, including the election of a Liberal Democrat mayor, led to speculation that Ward would find re-election extremely difficult; Ward even accused staff from the council of harassment during the 2005 general election campaign. However, she managed to hold off a strong Liberal Democrat challenge from Sal Brinton; despite a 12% swing against her, Ward held the seat with a majority of 1,148 votes (approximately 2.3%). The Conservative candidate was narrowly pushed into third place, with 793 fewer votes than Brinton, making Watford a three-way marginal seat.

Upon her re-election in May 2005, Ward was appointed an Assistant Government Whip before being promoted to full Whip, as a Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, on 5 May 2006. She was promoted again in October 2008 to Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, the lowest of the senior Whips. At the June 2009 Cabinet reshuffle, she replaced Shahid Malik as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Justice.

She claimed over £90,000 in second home allowance between 2004 and 2009, despite living less than 30 miles from Westminster. Upon publication of MPs&#x27; expenses in 2009, Ward defended her choice to fund a second home in Westminster from her parliamentary allowance, citing her need to balance her public duties with her duties as a mother of small children. Ward was one of 98 MPs who voted in favour of legislation which would have kept MPs&#x27; expense details secret.

Ward lost her seat at the 2010 general election, when she finished in third place with 14,750 votes, behind the successful Conservative Party candidate Richard Harrington (who received 19,291 votes) and the Liberal Democrat Sal Brinton (17,866 votes).

===Voting record===

The Labour Party was in Government throughout Ward&#x27;s time in Parliament. As of the end of 2009, Ward had rebelled against the Government&#x27;s stated or majority position 19 times out of 2,629 votes she attended, a rebelling rate of 0.72%. On occasion she voted against her party line on changes to the schedule of the House of Commons, and the Government&#x27;s position on reform of the House of Lords. In 2004, she voted with the Conservatives in favour of introducing a ban on the &quot;reasonable chastisement&quot; of children. In 2008, on a free vote, Ward voted against her party&#x27;s majority position on abortion, where she unsuccessfully voted in several separate bills for a reduction in the time when an abortion can be carried out from 24 weeks.

==Post-parliamentary career==
From June 2011 until its closure in March 2015, Ward was executive director of the Independent Pharmacy Federation. In April 2015, Ward became the Chair of Pharmacy Voice, an association of trade bodies representing community pharmacy contractors. She resigned this role in April 2017 as part of the Pharmacy Voice&#x27;s closure. Claire Ward was Chief Executive of the Institute for Collaborative Working from January 2019 to January 2022. She also continues roles in the pharmacy sector with the Pharmacists Defence Association and as Chair of Sigma Pharmaceuticals Annual Conference. She has been a Governor of the University of Hertfordshire since September 2018. She became a Non Executive Director of Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in May 2013 and was appointed chair in October 2021.

==Mayor of the East Midlands==

In August 2023, she was selected as Labour and Co-operative candidate to be the first mayor in the 2024 East Midlands mayoral election. In May 2024 she was elected to this position.

She subsequently announced that she would stand down as chair of the Hospitals Trust. At the same time, she said her first few months would involve building partnerships with those who could help her make changes over her massive region, using the £1.14 billion devolution deal covering 30 years, for transport, housing, skills, education, the economy and net-zero strategy in the huge East Midlands region. &#x27;We have been massively underfunded and under-invested in as a region, and it is really important we take those new powers and that funding from Westminster, we bring it in to this region and we decide our own priorities.&#x27;

==Family life==
When she was aged 28, Claire Ward met John Simpson, a plumber four years older than her, with his own business in Wembley, at a birthday party in Watford. They announced their engagement two years later. She married in 2003, and her first child, in 2005, was stillborn. She has subsequently had two further children.

<doc id="434962" wikidata="Q337536" url="?curid=434962" title="Nigel Waterson">
<text>Nigel Christopher Waterson (born 12 October 1950) is a British former politician. He was the Conservative Member of Parliament for Eastbourne from 1992 until 2010. Waterson was a junior minister in the government of John Major. He has been the chairman of the Equity Release Council since 2012. Waterson is currently chair of Dunsfold Parish Council.

==Early life==
He attended Leeds Grammar School (then a direct grant grammar school) and at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford he read law, graduating with a BA in 1971. He became a barrister and founded the firm Waterson Hicks. From 1974 to 1978 he was a councillor on Hammersmith and Fulham borough council.

==Parliamentary career==
He contested Islington South and Finsbury in 1979.

Waterson was the Shadow Minister for Pensions and Conservative Spokesman for Older People. He is a patron of many local charities, including President of the Eastbourne Constitutional Club and Vice President for Age Concern - Eastbourne. In the Conservative leadership contest in 2005 he backed Ken Clarke to be the next leader before Clarke lost in a preliminary round.

Waterson lost his seat to the Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd in the 2010 general election. This was just following the parliamentary expenses scandal, and Lloyd used his campaign literature to make claims about Waterson&#x27;s expenses. Following the election, Waterson sued Lloyd for libel over these statements. Waterson lost this case on appeal in 2013, after winning the initial High Court case in 2011.

==Personal life==
Waterson married Barbara Judge in 1999. He had two previous marriages, both ending in divorce, and has a son and a daughter. 
On 29 January 2008, Waterson was arrested for allegedly assaulting his two teenage children. In 2010 the Metropolitan Police Service apologised for any distress caused by the arrest, accepting the allegations were wholly unfounded, and paid damages and costs to Waterson in settlement of a civil claim for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment.

In January 2019 his adopted son, Stephen Waterson, was put on trial accused of manslaughter by crushing his girlfriend&#x27;s son with his electric car seat. He was also accused of intimidating the driver of the car. His girlfriend was found guilty of child cruelty in May 2019, and sentenced to two and a half years in prison, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on Stephen Waterson. On the first day of his re-trial in September 2019, he changed his plea to guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. Stephen Waterson was jailed for seven years.

<text>This is a list of urban areas in the United States and Canada categorized by the number of major professional sports teams in their urban areas.

==Major professional sports leagues==

The major professional sports leagues, or simply major leagues, in the United States and Canada are the highest professional competitions of team sports in the two countries. Although individual sports such as golf, mixed martial arts, tennis, and auto racing are also very popular, the term is usually limited to team sports.

The term &quot;major league&quot; was first used in 1921 in reference to Major League Baseball (MLB), the top level of professional American baseball. Today, the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada are Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four leagues are also commonly referred to as the &quot;Big Four&quot;. Each is the richest professional club competition in its respective sport worldwide. The best players can become cultural icons in both countries and elsewhere in the world, because the leagues enjoy a significant place in popular culture in the U.S. and Canada. The NFL and NHL each have 32 teams, and the MLB and NBA each have 30 teams.

Baseball, football and hockey have had professional leagues for over 100 years; early leagues such as the National Association, Ohio League and National Hockey Association formed the basis of the modern MLB, NFL and NHL respectively. Basketball is a relatively new development; the NBA evolved when the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merged, taking on its current form in 1949. The fifth biggest professional sports league is Major League Soccer (MLS), which will have 30 teams when the 2025 season begins. While soccer is very popular globally, it had struggled to become established in Canada and the United States with several professional leagues starting and folding before MLS was founded in 1996. The Canadian Football League (CFL), a much smaller league (9 teams), was founded in 1958 and is popular in Canada. All six of these leagues draw 15,000 or more fans in attendance per game on average as of 2015. This list includes a ranking by teams in the Big Four (B4) and a separate ranking including MLS and CFL teams called the Big Six (B6).

The most recent market to receive a new Big Four team is Salt Lake City, Utah, in which the NHL&#x27;s Utah Hockey Club made its debut in the 2024–25 season. The largest urban area without a team in one of the Big Four leagues is the 31st-ranked Austin region, though it does have an MLS team. The largest urban area without a team in one of the Big Six leagues is the 38th-ranked Virginia Beach-Norfolk region.

==Teams by urban area==
The following list contains all urban areas in the United States and Canada containing at least one team in any of the six major leagues. The number of teams in the Big Four leagues (B4) (NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL) and the Big Six leagues (B6) (aforementioned leagues plus MLS and CFL) are included in the table below. No urban area has teams in all six leagues, as NFL teams are exclusively in the United States and CFL teams are exclusively in Canada. There are currently 12 urban areas (11 in the United States and 1 in Canada) with teams in five of the six leagues (MLB, MLS, NBA, NHL, and NFL (United States) or CFL (Canada)).

<doc id="434965" wikidata="Q263653" url="?curid=434965" title="Angela Watkinson">
<text>Dame Angela Eileen Watkinson, DBE ( Ellicott; born 18 November 1941) is a British politician. She was Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Hornchurch and Upminster until 2017, and was first elected in 2001 to the earlier seat of Upminster, defeating Labour&#x27;s Keith Darvill who had taken the seat from the Conservatives in 1997. She was re-elected with increased majorities in 2005 and 2010.

On 19 April 2017, Watkinson announced that she would not be standing for re-election at the 2017 general election.

==Early life==

Born in Leytonstone, Essex, she attended Wanstead County High School (a grammar school, now Wanstead High School) on Redbridge Lane West in Wanstead. In 1989, she gained a Public Administration Higher National Certificate from Anglia Higher Education College. She worked for the Bank of New South Wales (since 1982 the Westpac Banking Corporation) from 1958 to 1964 and became a secretary in 1976 of a Special School in Essex, which helps physically handicapped children with riding lessons.

In 1988, she became a clerk to a school governing body, then committee clerk to Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council from 1988 to 1989. From 1989 to 1994, she was a committee manager for Basildon District Council. She was a councillor for Havering London Borough Council from 1994 to 1998, and on Essex County Council (for the division of Billericay North, from 1997–2001. This was a rare example of a councillor serving simultaneously on first tier authorities in different counties.

==Parliamentary career==
Watkinson was a member of the right-wing Conservative Monday Club, but resigned her membership in October 2001 when the newly elected Conservative leader Iain Duncan-Smith suspended his party&#x27;s links with the group. He declared that the club&#x27;s views on race and immigration were incompatible with his plans to reform the party, and Watkinson was one of three Conservative MPs forced to leave the group. An opponent of abortion, she introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill on 14 June 2006, which would have forced doctors offering abortion, or contraception advice to under-16s, to inform the child&#x27;s parents. MPs voted by 159 to 87 to reject the bill.

At a press conference on 13 March 2007, Watkinson stated that &quot;the whole premise of sex education was wrong&quot;. Watkinson is among a dozen or so MPs who hold the most firm record on sexual identity politics, disapproving of every piece of legislation supportive of homosexuality that has passed through the House of Commons. An exception was her vote in support of the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill on 5 February 2013.

She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for public and political service.

Watkinson has expressed opposition to the introduction of non-branded packaging for cigarettes; in a debate on this in 2014, Labour MP Diana Johnson pointed out that Watkinson had accepted hospitality and two tickets to the Chelsea Flower Show, worth £1,260, from Japan Tobacco, makers of Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes. She is a supporter of Israel and often spoke about that in the House of Commons.

In spite of her background as a right-wing &quot;lifelong Eurosceptic&quot;, she supported the Remain campaign in 2016 and opposed Brexit prior to the 2016 European Union membership referendum.

On 19 April 2017, Watkinson announced that she would not be standing for re-election at the 2017 general election.

==Personal life==
She lives in Essex and Westminster, and is a member and elder of the United Reformed Church. She is a member of the Conservative Christian Fellowship. She married Roy Watkinson, now a retired Metropolitan Police officer, in 1961 in Essex; the couple have a son and two daughters.

<doc id="434967" wikidata="Q263802" url="?curid=434967" title="Tom Watson, Baron Watson of Wyre Forest">
<text>Thomas Anthony Watson, Baron Watson of Wyre Forest (born 8 January 1967) is a British politician who served as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party from 2015 to 2019. A member of the House of Lords since 2022, he was the member of Parliament (MP) for West Bromwich East from 2001 to 2019.

Born in Sheffield, Watson was raised in Kidderminster, where he was educated at King Charles I School. He first became involved in Labour Party and trade-union activism while studying at the University of Hull and was chair of the National Organisation of Labour Students from 1992 to 1993. After working in marketing and advertising, he began working full-time for the Labour Party, including on its 1997 general election campaign, and then for the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union.

Elected MP for West Bromwich East at the 2001 general election, Watson was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Veterans from May to September 2006 and Parliamentary Secretary for the Cabinet Office from 2008 to 2009. In October 2011, Ed Miliband appointed him as the Labour Party&#x27;s national campaign coordinator and deputy chair. He resigned from both roles in July 2013, following a controversy over the selection of a new parliamentary candidate for Falkirk.

On 12 September 2015, Watson was elected as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party alongside the new leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Following the conviction of Carl Beech in July 2019 for making false allegations of paedophilia, Watson was criticised by high-profile victims and their relatives for his role in the affair, known as Operation Midland. Watson stood down as an MP in November 2019 and as deputy leader of the Labour Party in 2019, stating that his reasons for doing so were &quot;personal, not political&quot;. He later admitted that he had voted for Owen Smith in the 2016 leadership election. In March 2020, he was appointed chair of UK Music and later that year was made a senior adviser on problem gambling to Flutter Entertainment.

==Early life and career==
Watson was born in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and educated at King Charles I School, Kidderminster, although he left before completing his A-Levels. At the age of 17, in 1984, he became a trainee library assistant at the Labour Party’s Walworth Road headquarters. He then worked as a marketing officer and advertising account executive.

He later studied as a mature student at the University of Hull, where he was active in the Hull University Labour Club and elected President of the Students&#x27; Union in 1992, although he did not complete his degree. He was chair of the National Organisation of Labour Students from 1992 to 1993.

In 1993, he again worked for the Labour Party as National Development Officer for Youth and then worked on the party&#x27;s 1997 general election campaign. He then left to become the National Political Officer of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union.

==Early parliamentary career==
Watson was elected MP for West Bromwich East at the 2001 general election. He served on the Home Affairs Select Committee from 2001 to 2003, and supported the committee&#x27;s recommendation on UK drug policy to &quot;initiate a discussion within the Commission on Narcotic Drugs of alternative ways – including the possibility of legalisation and regulation – to tackle the global drugs dilemma&quot;. In his first year in parliament, he launched a campaign to ban album sales of convicted sex offender Gary Glitter.

In 2002, Watson moved a Ten Minute Rule Bill to change organ donation laws. Later that year, he was a leading candidate for the chair of the Labour Friends of Israel alongside Stephen Byers.

In 2003, Watson voted in favour of going to war with Iraq, and subsequently voted consistently against an investigation into the war.

In 2004 he won the &quot;New Statesman&quot; New Media Award in the category of elected representative for being one of the first MPs to use his blog to further the democratic process.

Watson was campaign chair for Labour in the Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election in July 2004. The campaign drew criticism for its dirty tactics, particularly a Labour leaflet proclaiming &quot;Labour is on your side – the Lib Dems are on the side of failed asylum seekers&quot;, for which Watson later admitted responsibility and expressed regrets.

==In government==
Watson was appointed as an assistant government whip in September 2004. He was promoted in May 2006 to Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Veterans and was instrumental in ensuring that soldiers shot for cowardice in the First World War received posthumous pardons. On 5 September 2006, it was reported he had signed a letter to Tony Blair urging the Prime Minister&#x27;s resignation to end the uncertainty over his succession. The Chief Whip, Jacqui Smith, told Watson that evening to either withdraw his signature to the letter or resign his post. On 6 September 2006, he resigned his ministerial position and released a further statement calling on Blair to resign. Blair was quoted by the BBC as saying the statement and letter from Watson were &quot;disloyal, discourteous and wrong&quot; and that he would be seeing Watson later that day.

Watson returned as a government whip in July 2007, after Gordon Brown became prime minister. As Parliamentary Secretary for the Cabinet Office from January 2008 to June 2009, he was Minister for Digital Engagement and Civil Service Issues. Watson took a particular interest in digital affairs and in making non-personal government data more available to the public – promoting innovative data use and open source software.

Watson served on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee from July 2009 to September 2012. He led a number of MPs in speaking out firmly against the Digital Economy Act 2010, as the bill was being passed through Parliament in April 2010. He took part in a protest against the bill outside parliament on 24 March 2010.

===Expenses===

On 10 May 2009 it was revealed that since being re-elected to parliament in 2005, Watson had claimed the maximum £4,800 allowance for food in a single year. From 2005 to 2009, Watson and Iain Wright claimed over £100,000 on a central London flat they shared. Watson responded that a &quot;pizza wheel&quot; that appeared on a Marks &amp; Spencer receipt he had submitted was given as a free gift after he spent £150 at the store. He added: &quot;All claims were made under the rules set out by the House of Commons authorities. I fully understand why the public expects the system to be reformed. I voted for this last week and only hope that reforms can go even further as quickly as possible.&quot;

==Early opposition career==
In October 2011 Watson was promoted to become the Labour Party National Campaign Coordinator and Deputy Chair of the Labour Party, to work with Jon Trickett and Michael Dugher in the Shadow Cabinet Office, running Labour&#x27;s elections and campaigns. He resigned from this position in July 2013, in light of the 2013 Labour Party Falkirk candidate selection row.

In 2013, Watson joined a cross-party campaign in support of a referendum on Britain&#x27;s membership of the European Union. He supported an amendment by the Conservative MP Adam Afriyie which called for a referendum to be held before the 2015 general election.

===Media===
Watson has been critical of conservative former Fox News host Glenn Beck, claiming Beck&#x27;s &quot;type of journalism is dangerous and can have wide-ranging negative effects on society. The kind of material broadcast by Glenn Beck is not unique; a number of other &#x27;shock jocks&#x27; operate in the States. However, none has displayed intolerance on such a frequent and irresponsible scale as Glenn Beck. It is vital that that kind of &#x27;news&#x27; is not made or broadcast in the UK. However, the proposed acquisition of BSkyB by News Corporation means that there is an increased chance of it becoming a reality.&quot;

Watson played a significant role in the News International phone hacking scandal by helping to bring the series of events at the &quot;News of the World&quot; into the open. As a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, he questioned Rupert and James Murdoch, along with former &quot;News of the World&quot; editor Rebekah Brooks, in a Committee session on 19 July 2011. After the subsequent re-questioning of James Murdoch on 10 November 2011, Watson likened him to a mafia boss.

In July 2011 it was announced that Watson and his co-author Martin Hickman, a journalist from &quot;The Independent&quot;, were writing a book dealing with the relationship between newspapers belonging to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News International and senior British politicians and police officers. Watson wrote his book at the same time as &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Nick Davies was writing his, which was subsequently released as &quot;Hack Attack: How the Truth Caught Up with Rupert Murdoch&quot;. Watson and Davies subsequently met and discussed their respective projects. The publication date and title of Watson&#x27;s book, &quot;Dial M for Murdoch: News Corporation and the Corruption of Britain&quot;, were released just three days before it was due to go on sale amid fears News International would try to prevent the launch. On the day details of the book were revealed, Watson indicated on his blog his belief that the book would be controversial: &quot;Very excited to say we&#x27;ve finally finished the book. It&#x27;s out this Thursday. I have a hunch it will be one of the most attacked books this year.&quot;

===Operation Midland===

On 24 October 2012, Watson suggested in the House of Commons that a paedophile network may have existed in the past at a high level, protected by connections to Parliament and involving a close aide to a former Prime Minister; neither the aide nor the former Prime Minister was named. He called on the Metropolitan Police to reopen a closed criminal inquiry into previous allegations. These allegations were based upon information provided to him by an NHS doctor to whom a disclosure of alleged abuse had been made by the man claiming to be a victim. In an interview with Kevin Maguire of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; at the University of Warwick, Watson gave the account of the information that had been presented to him, on which he based his call for an investigation. In December 2012, the Metropolitan Police stated that, after Watson had passed information to them, they had established Operation Fairbank to investigate the allegations. However, by March 2016 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Operation Fairbank caused much speculation on the internet but made little progress in exposing the alleged paedophile ring.
In 2015, Watson was criticised for consistently refusing to comment after it was revealed that the police had been pushed into investigating rape allegations against Leon Brittan by Watson, who wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and that the police later had to apologise that Brittan&#x27;s family were not told that the case was dropped before his death. Watson had repeated the allegations after the death. The rape allegations were examined by the Metropolitan Police but officers could not find evidence that would lead to further action. The person making the original allegations, Carl Beech, was later found guilty of making up the Westminster VIP paedophile ring.

Watson was described in March 2019 at the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse by lawyers for the falsely accused former MP, Harvey Proctor, as a &quot;vehicle for conspiracy theorists&quot;. After Beech&#x27;s conviction in July 2019, Lady Brittan said: “It is too late for Tom Watson to apologise but his attempt to distance himself from the false allegations of Carl Beech in the wake of the guilty verdict is disingenuous and untruthful&quot;. Harvey Proctor said &quot;The Metropolitan Police were lapdogs to Mr Watson&#x27;s crude dog whistle. It&#x27;s time for the torchlight to take a closer look at Mr Watson. It is now beyond doubt that all of these allegations could never have been true and only someone with spectacular bad judgement could think that they might be. It is time for an apology from him to me...&quot; Proctor added, &quot;He denies it now, but he was the cheerleader in chief for Mr Beech. He was in the team. Tom Watson scared the Metropolitan Police to death over phone hacking. He intended to do the same for historic child sexual abuse. Not because Tom Watson has got any interest in historic child sexual abuse. Tom Watson has got a great interest in himself, and in grandstanding, just as he is doing currently on his so-called anti-Semitism campaign.&quot; Proctor later asked the Labour Party to suspend Watson and to investigate his behaviour on the grounds of breaching the party&#x27;s membership code and bringing it into disrepute. Lord Bramall&#x27;s son also demanded an apology. One of the daughters of the late Greville Janner, who was also accused by Beech, Rabbi Janner-Klausner, said &quot;We have a system where people are believed instantly before the evidence is examined instead of being listened to compassionately and the allegations properly investigated. People were able to accuse (my father) without a shred of evidence and were believed straight away.&quot; Daniel Janner QC, his son, said &quot;Tom Watson should resign. He appointed himself Britain’s chief paedo-finder general and created a moral panic. His motive was personal political advancement riding on a bandwagon of public frenzy which he had whipped up. He should hang his head in shame. For him to take the moral high ground in the Labour Party against antisemitism is completely hypocritical.&quot;

Watson had also lobbied successfully Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions to reopen Operation Vincente, an investigation into an alleged rape in 1967 by Leon Brittan. The police had concluded initially that the allegation, made in 2014 by a woman with a history of mental health problems, was false. As a result of reopening the case, Brittan was interviewed under caution and was not told before his death that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.

In October 2019, details of the Henriques report emerged. The report said, of Watson, &quot;His interest, however, in both Operation Midland and Operation Vincente created further pressure upon MPS officers.”; specifically, “A possible inference is that the officers, then responsible, were in a state of panic induced by Mr Watson’s letter.” It adds that Watson described Lord Brittan as being as “close to evil as any human being could be”, saying he “grossly insulted” the former home secretary. Harvey Proctor said: “The problem was that the police assigned to interview Beech lacked common sense and yielded to intense pressure from Tom Watson, an irresponsible politician out for his own publicity in order to galvanise his advancement to become deputy leader of the Labour party.” Lady Brittan said “The extent of Tom Watson’s involvement in the witch-hunt of innocent people has been laid bare. His subsequent attempts to distance himself show a complete lack of integrity. By misusing his public office to recklessly repeat false allegations, and to characterise himself as a victim, he has shown that he is unfit to hold the office of MP.”

==Deputy Leader of the Labour Party==
On 8 May 2015, the day after the Labour Party lost the general election, Watson announced his intention to stand in the ensuing deputy leadership election, becoming the first to declare. Watson was nominated by 59 Members of Parliament, more than any other candidate, and quickly emerged as the front runner. On 12 September he was elected as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party with 198,962 votes or 50.7% in the third round, including second preference votes from those who voted for other candidates. He was also appointed Chair of the Labour Party and Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office by new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. In 2019 after he stood down both as an MP and as Deputy Leader he said he had voted for Owen Smith in the 2016 Leadership election.

Watson was the Vice Chair of Trade Union Friends of Israel (TUFI) as of 2015.

In December 2015, Watson spoke about Labour members who took part in a vigil against proposed UK airstrikes on Syria outside the office of Stella Creasy MP, saying that &quot;if there were Labour party members on that [anti-war] demonstration, intimidating staff members of an MP like that, then I think they should be removed from the party.&quot; His spokesman later said that Watson was unaware that the office was empty at the time.

In October 2016, Watson abstained, along with 100 other Labour MPs who abstained on or voted against the Labour Party&#x27;s unsuccessful motion to withdraw UK support from the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen. The Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen had led to thousands of civilian casualties.

Watson announced in October 2017 that he had gone on hunger strike, in support of two Guantánamo Bay detainees also on hunger strike, after the US government changed its policy on prisoners who refuse food; they will not be fed at all, instead of being force fed.

In the October 2016 shadow cabinet reshuffle, Watson was made Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. In that role, he called for greater scrutiny of a planned takeover of Sky UK by Murdoch-owned Fox, backed the TV licence fee, criticised government pressure on Ofcom in relation to regulation of the BBC, and proposed fairer rail ticketing for football fans. In 2017, he announced the Labour Party would launch a review of the NHS treatment of gambling addiction. The review was published in 2018 which proposed a blanket ban in the use of credit cards for betting.

In June 2017, Ian Lavery replaced Watson as Labour Party Chair.

In March 2018, Watson backed calls for a statue to be erected in memory of women&#x27;s rights campaigner Mary Wollstonecraft.

In September 2018, Watson vowed that if Labour won the next general election he would set up an independent, cross-party commission to investigate ways of preventing type-2 diabetes, with the aim of eliminating the estimated rise in cases within five years.

Following defections of Labour MPs in 2019 to The Independent Group, later Change UK, Watson set up the Future Britain Group of Labour politicians. He was criticised for continuing to accept funding from property developer David Garrard, who was reported to have given Change UK £1.5 million and to have financially supported Joan Ryan and Ian Austin since their departure from Labour. Watson has also received funding from businessman Trevor Chinn.

In July 2019, Watson was criticised by Labour&#x27;s General Secretary Jennie Formby for being irresponsible in criticising Labour&#x27;s handling of antisemitism claims. Formby said he risked exacerbating fears in the Jewish community and that, while antisemitism was a real problem, steps had been taken to tackle it. Watson had asked for a copy of the party response to a request by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to be released to the Shadow Cabinet and the NEC, which Formby said she had already offered sight of to Watson (she did not address the subject of releasing it to the rest of the Shadow Cabinet and NEC), and had previously asked to be copied in on individual complaints, which had data protection issues. In response to Watson&#x27;s claim that the party&#x27;s response to the Panorama programme &quot;Is Labour Anti-Semitic&quot; had &quot;smeared&quot; the former Labour staff members and &quot;breached all common standards of decency&quot;, Formby stated that all current Labour staff members had access to an &quot;Employee Assistance Programme&quot; but said the party was not made aware of the distress suffered by staff members at the time and she was &quot;very concerned&quot; to hear about it for the first time in the Panorama documentary. Watson was also criticised for attacking Formby when she was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.

The same month, former Labour and Respect MP George Galloway and former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor announced individually that they planned to stand against Watson at the next general election, Galloway as a pro-Brexit pro-Corbyn independent, and Proctor in protest at Watson&#x27;s role in the false paedophilia allegations of Operation Midland. July also saw Watson be the subject of a complaint to the Labour Party for making allegedly antisemitic remarks; he had in his Easter message asked readers to recall the arrest of Christ by &quot;a squad of Roman soldiers under the direction of a servant to the High Priest.&quot; The complainant, Geoffrey Alderman, said that the fact this was not antisemitic under the IHRA definition adopted by the Labour Party highlighted the definition&#x27;s &quot;flaws&quot;. This was also the month in which cartoonist Steve Bell protested to &quot;The Guardian&quot; after it refused to run an installment of his long running &#x27;If...&#x27; cartoon strip, which portrayed Watson as an &quot;antisemite finder general&quot;.

In September 2019, Watson made a speech urging Labour to become a pro-remain party, in order to win back disaffected remain voters. He has been quoted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as saying that &quot;most of those who&#x27;ve deserted us over our Brexit policy did so with deep regret and would greatly prefer to come back; they just want us to take an unequivocal position that, whatever happens, we&#x27;ll fight to remain, and to sound like we mean it.&quot; Jeremy Corbyn rejected his proposition, saying that Labour would continue to represent both sides of the Brexit divide.

===Resignation===
On 6 November 2019 Watson announced that he would be standing down both as an MP and as Deputy Leader and leave office on 12 December 2019. He stated his decision was &quot;personal, not political&quot; and declared his intention to continue campaigning on health issues. The Jewish Labour Movement described his decision to step down as &quot;shocking and saddening&quot;.

Expanding on the reasons for his resignation in an interview in December 2019, he said &quot;two weeks before I resigned, a guy was arrested for giving me a death threat. He was a Labour supporter. The police got in touch and said, &#x27;We&#x27;ve arrested this guy&#x27;, assuming I knew about it. But I didn&#x27;t. The Labour party had sent out a fundraising email that he had responded to with a death threat. The party reported it to the police, but didn&#x27;t tell me... the brutality and hostility is real and it&#x27;s day to day. So I just thought: now&#x27;s the time to take a leap, do something different. You&#x27;ve had a good innings. You&#x27;ve done good stuff. Go now.&quot; His former constituency, West Bromwich East, went to the Conservative Party for the first time since its foundation in 1974, with the Conservatives gaining a 12.1 swing on Labour.

== Later career ==

In March 2020, Watson was appointed chair of UK Music.

In the summer of 2020, Watson participated in the ITV reality programme &quot;Don&#x27;t Rock The Boat&quot;, which was broadcast in November 2020.

In September 2020, Watson, who had previously been heavily critical of the gambling industry, took a job as a senior adviser on problem gambling to Flutter Entertainment, which runs the UK gambling companies Paddy Power, Betfair and Sky Bet.

He produced an autobiographical book, &quot;Downsizing&quot; (2020), and presented a two-part documentary on ITV, &quot;Giving Up Sugar for Good&quot; (2021), documenting his personal experience of losing seven stone in less than twelve months and putting his type 2 diabetes into remission by following a low-carbohydrate lifestyle.

===Peerage===

In January 2020, it was reported that Watson had been nominated for a peerage. According to John Rentoul, who wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot;, his nomination was subsequently rejected by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, the body that vets nominees for &quot;propriety&quot;. Watson is believed to have been rejected owing to his actions surrounding Operation Midland.

In August 2020, it was reported by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that Watson was to once again be nominated for a peerage, in this instance by the Labour leader Keir Starmer.

It was announced on 14 October 2022, that as part of the 2022 Special Honours, Watson would receive a life peerage. On 21 November 2022, he was created Baron Watson of Wyre Forest, &quot;of Kidderminster in the County of Worcestershire.

==Personal life==
Watson married Siobhan Corby in 2000. They had two children before separating in 2012. He was later in a relationship with future Labour MP Stephanie Peacock.

In September 2018, during an interview with BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Today Programme&quot;, Watson revealed that he had been diagnosed with type-2 diabetes but had &quot;reversed&quot; the condition through diet and exercise. Watson explained that, between the summer of 2017 and September 2018, he had lost . He also revealed that he had &quot;battled weight since my early 20s&quot;.

Watson is a gamer and a regular reviewer of games for &quot;New Statesman&quot; and other titles. He finds it relaxing and confessed to spending too much time on &quot;Portal 2&quot; while preparing for questions during the hacking story interviews. He is also a fan of alternative rock music, especially the band Drenge, whom he recommended to the Labour leader Ed Miliband in his letter of resignation when stepping down from the post of party general-election co-ordinator. He additionally likes the music of Courtney Jaye, Danny Coughlan, Billy Bragg, Elvis Costello, Primal Scream and Public Enemy.

<text>Alan Patrick Vincent Whitehead CBE (born 15 September 1950) is a British Labour Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Southampton Test from 1997 to 2024. He served as Shadow Minister for Energy Security, previously Green New Deal and Energy, from 2015 to 2024. He served as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions from 2001 to 2002.

==Early life and career==
Alan Whitehead was born on 15 September 1950 in Isleworth, London, and attended Isleworth Grammar School. He studied Politics and Philosophy at the University of Southampton, where he became President of University of Southampton Students&#x27; Union and received a PhD in Political Science. 

From 1979 to 1982 he was Director of OUTSET charity, then from 1983 to 1992 he worked for the BIIT charity, where he was also a director. 

Whitehead was the Leader of Southampton City Council from 1984 to 1992 and a professor of Public Policy at Southampton Institute. As leader of Southampton City Council in 1986, Whitehead proposed that the city council take measures to become a &#x27;self sustaining city&#x27; with regard to energy generation. One such measure was the conversion of Southampton Civic Centre to being heated by local reservoirs of geothermal energy.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1979 general election, Whitehead stood as the Labour candidate in New Forest, coming third with 19.7% of the vote behind the incumbent Conservative MP Patrick McNair-Wilson and the Liberal candidate.

Whitehead stood in Southampton Test in three successive elections, 1983, 1987, and 1992. In 1983 with 28.1% of the vote behind the incumbent Conservative MP James Hill. He came second again in 1987 with 33.3% of the vote, again behind James Hill. In 1992 he again came second behind James Hill, with 42.4% of the vote.

At the 1997 general election, Whitehead was elected to Parliament as MP for Southampton Test with 54.1% of the vote and a majority of 13,684. 

He was re-elected as MP for Southampton Test at the 2001 general election with a decreased vote share of 52.5% and a decreased majority of 11,207.

From June 2001 to May 2002, Whitehead was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions.

Whitehead was again re-elected at the 2005 general election with a decreased vote share of 42.7% and a decreased majority of 7,018.

Whitehead&#x27;s Private Members Bill was &#x27;talked out&#x27; by Conservative backbenchers in 2005, but many of its most important aspects were incorporated into the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006, sponsored by fellow Labour MP Mark Lazarowicz.

In June 2006, the UK Parliamentary Football Team ran a charity match in Portugal against the Portuguese Parliament, which coincided with part of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The match and the trip were sponsored by McDonald&#x27;s as part of their Football in the Community Programme. The UKPFC was criticised by the British Medical Association for accepting McDonald&#x27;s sponsorship. Whitehead, who was the goalkeeper for the UKPFC, fully declared the sponsorship in his register of members interests. He also pointed out the trip was part of a long-standing fundraising campaign between the UKPFC and McDonald&#x27;s that raised over 20,000 euros for local charities.

In September 2006, Whitehead voted against the Iraq War on the basis of the mission not receiving endorsement from the UN.

Also in September 2006, Whitehead criticised the results of the Energy Review, and was the co-author of EDM 2204 which states &#x27;the case for nuclear has not yet been made&#x27; and urges the government to &#x27;recognise the enormous potential for reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by energy efficiency and conservation, greater use of combined heat and power, and rapid investment in the full range of renewable technologies, including microgeneration&#x27;.

Due to the high concentration of houses in multiple occupation in Southampton, in May 2007 Whitehead proposed changing planning regulations which would mean a landlord would be required to apply for planning permission if they wanted to convert a family home into an HMO housing more than four people. The proposal was considered as part of the government&#x27;s current review of the private housing sector, to report in October 2008.

Whitehead rebelled in October 2009 against a government 3-line whip on the renewal of the UK Trident programme. His rebellion was put down to the fact that he was a historical supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, having paid a subscription to Southampton CND in 1982.

At the 2010 general election, Whitehead was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 38.5% and a decreased majority of 2,413.

Whitehead is an outspoken supporter of action on anthropogenic climate change, and in September 2013 called debate by members of parliament who reject the scientific view a &quot;flat earth love-in&quot;.

Whitehead was again re-elected at the 2015 general election, with an increased vote share of 41.3% and an increased majority of 3,810.

He supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election.

From October 2016 to April 2020, Whitehead was Shadow Minister for Energy and Climate Change.

Whitehead was one of the 52 Labour MPs who defied Jeremy Corbyn and in February 2017 voted against triggering Article 50. He claimed that triggering Article 50 without clarity on what would be done was not in the UK&#x27;s best interest, and he was not prepared to stand by and allow the country to go down what he regarded as a potentially very dangerous path.

At the snap 2017 general election, Whitehead was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 58.7% and an increased majority of 11,508.

Whitehead was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 49.5% and a decreased majority of 6,213.

In March 2020, Whitehead was appointed Shadow Minister for Energy and the Green New Deal.

In January 2022 Whitehead announced that he would be standing down at the next general election.

==Personal life==
Whitehead married Sophie Wronska in 1979, and they have a son and daughter.

He is a member of the Saints Trust and plays in the UK parliamentary football team. After looking at the possibility of being the first MP to install a wind turbine installed on his constituency home roof in Highfield, Southampton, Whitehead installed a number of solar panels that were integrated into the roof. During the summer months, Whitehead says he sells electricity from this source back to the national grid.

He is a visiting professor in the Faculty of Media, Arts and Society at Southampton Solent University.

<text>Malcolm Hunt Wicks (1 July 1947 – 29 September 2012) was a British Labour Party politician and academic specialising in social policy. He was a member of parliament (MP) from 1992, first for Croydon North West and then for Croydon North, until his death in 2012.

==Early life and education==
Wicks was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, to Arthur Wicks, a Labour member of the London County Council and later Greater London Council. He was educated at the independent Elizabeth College, Guernsey; North West London Polytechnic and the London School of Economics gaining a BSc in Sociology.

==Early career==
From 1968 to 1970, he was a research fellow of the Department of Social Administration at the University of York, then a research worker at the Centre for Environmental Studies from 1970 to 1972. Wicks worked in the Urban Deprivation Unit (abolished in 1978) of the Home Office as a social policy analyst from 1974 to 1977, and was a lecturer in Social Administration at Brunel University from 1970 to 1974. From 1977 to 1978, he was a lecturer in Social Policy at the Civil Service College (now called the National School of Government) in Ascot, then research director and secretary of the Study Commission on the Family from 1978 to 1983. He was later Director of the Family Policy Studies Centre from 1983 to 1992. He was the author and co-author of many publications, including &quot;Old and Cold: hypothermia and social policy&quot; and &quot;A Future for All: Do we need the Welfare State?&quot; His keen concern about fuel poverty led to him to act as a Trustee of the National Energy Foundation (1988–94).

He was involved in politics in Croydon, chairing his local Constituency Labour Party and standing for election to Croydon Council before his election to Parliament.

It was only revealed in his posthumous memoirs that in 1976 Wicks had leaked Cabinet papers to Frank Field at the Child Poverty Action Group. This action proved decisive in preventing the Callaghan government from introducing means testing of child benefit.

==Parliamentary career==
He was first elected in 1992 for Croydon North West after having previously contested the seat unsuccessfully in 1987.

Wicks was one of the few MPs whose Private Member&#x27;s Bill reached the statute books, with the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995 recognising the needs of family carers.

He was Chairman of the Education Select Committee from 1998 until his July 1999 appointment as Minister for Lifelong Learning in the Department for Education and Employment. In July 2001, he moved to the Department for Work and Pensions, where he spent four years, first as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, and then as Minister of State for Pensions. In May 2005, he was appointed as Minister for Energy at the Department of Trade and Industry in the post-election Cabinet reshuffle. In a mini-reshuffle on 10 November 2006, following the retirement of Lord Sainsbury, Wicks was appointed as Minister of State for Science and Innovation in the same department.

In Gordon Brown&#x27;s first reshuffle on 28 June 2007, Wicks was moved to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, which replaced the Department of Trade and Industry, to resume his old role as Minister for Energy. It is reported that Wicks was intended to serve in the cabinet, but the post-it note bearing his name and position fell onto the floor. He was a vice-president of Carers UK and the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society. Wicks stood down from the government in October 2008 for issues relating to a decommissioning scheme at Sellafield, accepting an appointment to the Privy Council and becoming the Prime Minister&#x27;s special representative on international energy issues. He emerged with an enhanced reputation during the MPs expenses scandal being deemed a &quot;parliamentary angel.&quot;

Wicks was re-elected as the MP for Croydon North on 6 May 2010 with an increased majority of 16,483.

==Death==
Wicks died on 29 September 2012, aged 65. He had been suffering from cancer.

==Personal life==
Wicks married Margaret Baron in 1968 and they had a son and two daughters.

<text>John &quot;Iron-Mad&quot; Wilkinson (1728 – 14 July 1808) was an English industrialist who pioneered the manufacture of cast iron and the use of cast-iron goods during the Industrial Revolution. He was the inventor of a precision boring machine that could bore cast iron cylinders, such as cannon barrels and piston cylinders used in the steam engines of James Watt. His boring machine has been called the first machine tool. He also developed a blowing device for blast furnaces that allowed higher temperatures, increasing their efficiency, and helped sponsor the first iron bridge in Coalbrookdale. He is notable for his method of cannon boring, his techniques at casting iron and his work with the government of France to establish a cannon foundry.

==Biography==

===Early life===
John Wilkinson was born in Little Clifton, Bridgefoot, Cumberland (now part of Cumbria), the eldest son of Isaac Wilkinson and Mary Johnson. Isaac was then the potfounder at the blast furnace there, one of the first to use coke instead of charcoal, which was pioneered by Abraham Darby.

John and his half-brother William, who was 17 years younger, were raised in a non-conformist Presbyterian family and he was educated at a dissenting academy at Kendal, Westmorland (also now part of Cumbria), run by Dr Caleb Rotherham. His sister Mary married another non-conformist, Joseph Priestley in 1762. Priestley also played a role in educating John&#x27;s younger brother, William.

In 1745, when John was 17, he was apprenticed to a Liverpool merchant for five years and then entered into partnership with his father.

When his father moved to Bersham furnace near Wrexham, north Wales, in 1753 John remained at Kirkby Lonsdale in Westmorland where he married Ann Maudesley on 12 June 1755.

===Iron master===

After working with his father in his foundry, from 1755 John Wilkinson became a partner in the Bersham concern and in 1757 with partners, he erected a blast furnace at Willey, near Broseley in Shropshire. Later he built another furnace and works at New Willey. He made his home in Broseley in a house called &#x27;The Lawns&#x27; which became his headquarters for many years. He had houses either side of &#x27;The Lawns&#x27; which served for administration, one being named &#x27;The Mint&#x27; used for distribution of the thousands of tokens, each valued equivalent to a halfpenny. In east Shropshire he also developed iron works at Snedshill, Hollinswood, Hadley and Hampton Loade. He and Edward Blakeway also leased land to build another works at Bradley in Bilston parish, near Wolverhampton. He became known as the &#x27;Father&#x27; of the extensive South Staffordshire iron industry with Bilston as the start of the Black Country. In 1761, he took over Bersham Ironworks as well. Bradley became his largest and most successful enterprise, and was the site of extensive experiments in getting raw coal to substitute for coke in the production of cast iron. At its peak, it included a number of blast furnaces, a brick works, potteries, glass works, and rolling mills. The Birmingham Canal was subsequently built near the Bradley works.

==Inventions==
Wilkinson was a prolific inventor of new products and processes, and especially anything connected with novel uses of cast iron and wrought iron. His development of a machine tool for boring cast iron cannons presaged the accurate boring of cylinders for the first Watt steam engines. He also improved the air supply for the blast furnace using a new design of bellows, and was the first to use wrought iron in canal barges. He supported the construction of the first important cast iron bridge at Coalbrookdale.

===Cannon boring machine===

Bersham became well known for high-quality casting and a producer of guns and cannon. Historically, cannons had been cast with a core and then bored to remove imperfections, but in 1774 Wilkinson patented a technique for boring iron guns from a solid piece, rotating the gun barrel rather than the boring-bar. This technique made the guns more accurate since the bore was uniform in diameter, and less likely to explode. While bronze cannons were already being bored from the solid, the boring of large iron naval cannon was novel. The patent was quashed in 1779 (the Royal Navy saw it as a monopoly and sought to overthrow it) but Wilkinson still remained a major manufacturer.

In 1792, Wilkinson bought the Brymbo Hall estate in Denbighshire, not far from Bersham, where furnaces and other plant were installed. After his death and the decline of his industrial empire, the ironworks lay idle for some years until in 1842. It became once again an important works and eventually became Brymbo Steelworks, which continued to operate until 1990.

===Boring machine for steam engines===
James Watt had tried unsuccessfully for several years to obtain accurately bored cylinders for his steam engines, and was forced to use hammered iron, which was out of round and caused leakage past the piston. In 1774 John Wilkinson invented a boring machine in which the shaft that held the cutting tool extended through the cylinder and was supported on both ends, unlike the cantilevered borers then in use. With this machine he was able to bore the cylinder for Boulton &amp; Watt&#x27;s first commercial engine, and was given an exclusive contract for the provision of cylinders owing to the lower tolerance between the piston and cylinder and the resulting improvement in efficiency by lowering steam losses through the gap. Until this era, advancements in drilling and boring practice had lain only within the application field of gun barrels for firearms and cannon; Wilkinson&#x27;s achievement was a milestone in the gradual development of boring technology, as its fields of application broadened into engines, pumps, and other industrial uses.

While the main market for steam engines had been for pumping water out of mines, he saw much more use for them in the driving of machinery in ironworks such as blowing engines, forge hammers and rolling mills, the first rotary action steam engine being installed at Bradley in 1783. Among his many inventions was a reversing rolling mill with two steam cylinders that made the process much more economical.

John Wilkinson took a key interest in obtaining orders for these more efficient steam engines and other uses for cast iron from the owners of Cornish copper mines. As part of this interest, he bought shares in eight of the mines to help provide capital.

===Hydraulic blowing engine===
In 1757, Wilkinson patented a hydraulic powered blowing engine to increase the air blast through the tuyeres for blast furnaces, so improving the rate of production of cast iron. The historian Joseph Needham likened Wilkinson&#x27;s design to the one described in 1313 by the Chinese Imperial Government metallurgist Wang Zhen in his &quot;Treatise on Agriculture&quot;.

==Iron Bridge==
In 1775 John Wilkinson was the prime mover initiating the building of the Iron Bridge connecting the then-important industrial town of Broseley with the other side of the River Severn. His friend Thomas Farnolls Pritchard had written to him with plans for the bridge. A committee of subscribers was formed, mostly including Broseley businessmen, to agree to the use of iron rather than wood or stone and obtain price quotations and an authorising act of Parliament.

Wilkinson&#x27;s persuasion and drive held together the group&#x27;s support through several problems during the parliamentary process. Had Wilkinson not succeeded in this and also drawn support from influential parliamentarians, the bridge might not have been built or might have been made of other materials. Consequently, the name &#x27;Ironbridge&#x27; would not have been coined for the district in Madeley; the area would not have attained the status of a World Heritage Site. Abraham Darby III was chosen as the preferred builder after quoting to build the bridge for £3,150/-/-. When construction started, Wilkinson sold his shares to Abraham Darby III in 1777, leaving the latter to steer the project to its successful conclusion in 1779 and be opened in 1781.

In 1787 he launched the first barge made of wrought iron, constructed in Broseley. It was a development which would become common over the years ahead and in large ships in the following century. He patented several other inventions.

==Copper interests==

John Wilkinson made his fortune selling high quality goods made of iron and reached his limit of investment expansion. His expertise proved useful when he invested in many copper interests. In 1761, the Royal Navy clad the hull of the frigate with copper sheet to reduce the growth of marine biofouling and prevent attack by the Teredo shipworm. The drag from the hull growth cut the speed and the shipworm caused severe hull damage, especially in tropical waters. After the success of this work the Navy decreed that all ships should be clad and this created a large demand for copper that Wilkinson noted during his visits to shipyards. He bought shares in eight Cornish copper mines and met Thomas Williams, the &#x27;Copper King&#x27; of the Parys Mountain mines in Anglesey. Besides supplying Williams with large quantities of plate and equipment, Wilkinson also supplied scrap for the process of recovery of copper from solution by cementation. Wilkinson bought a 1/16th share in the Mona Mine at Parys Mountain and shares in Williams industries at Holywell, Flintshire, St Helens, near Liverpool and Swansea, South Wales. Wilkinson and Williams worked together on several projects. They were amongst the first to issue trade tokens (&#x27;Willys&#x27; and &#x27;Druids&#x27;) to alleviate the shortage of small coins. Jointly they set up the Cornish Metal Company in 1785 as a marketing company for copper. Its aim was to ensure both a good return for the Cornish miners and a stable price for the users of copper. Warehouses were set up in Birmingham, London, Bristol and Liverpool.

To help his business interests and to service his trade tokens, Wilkinson bought into partnerships with banks in Birmingham, Bilston, Bradley, Brymbo and Shrewsbury.

==Lead mines and works==

Wilkinson bought lead mines at Minera in Wrexham, five miles from Bersham, Llyn Pandy at Soughton (now Sychdyn) and Mold, also in Flintshire He installed steam pumping engines to make them viable again. His lead was exported through the port of Chester. To use some of the lead produced, Wilkinson had a lead pipe works at Rotherhithe, London. This factory lasted for many years eventually making the solder filler alloys used in the car factory at Dagenham.

==Philanthropy==

Wilkinson had a good reputation as an employer. Wherever new works were established, cottages were built to accommodate employees and their families. He gave significant financial support to his brother-in-law, the famous chemist Dr Joseph Priestley. He became a church warden in Broseley and was later elected High Sheriff of Denbighshire. In schools that had no slates he was able to provide iron troughs to hold sand for the practice of writing and arithmetic. He provided a cast-iron pulpit for the church at Bilston.

==Family life, and death==
John married Ann Maudsley in 1759. Her family was wealthy and her dowry helped to pay for a share in the New Willey Company. After the death of Ann, his second marriage, when he was 35, was to Mary Lee, whose money helped him to buy out his partners. When he was in his seventies, his mistress Mary Ann Lewis, a maid at his estate in Brymbo Hall, gave birth to his only children, a boy and two girls.

By 1796, when he was 68, he was producing about one-eighth of Britain&#x27;s cast iron. He became &quot;a titan&quot; – very wealthy, and somewhat eccentric. His &quot;iron madness&quot; reached a peak in the 1790s, when he had almost everything around him made of iron, even several coffins and a massive obelisk to mark his grave, which still stands in the village of Lindale-in-Cartmel, now in Cumbria. He was appointed Sheriff of Denbighshire for 1799.

He died on 14 July 1808 at his works in Bradley, probably from diabetes. He was originally buried at his Castlehead estate at Grange-over-Sands, raised above the adjoining moss lands which he drained and improved from 1778 onwards.

He left a very large estate in his will (more than £130,000 - equivalent to £ in ), to which he intended to make his three children the principal heirs, with executors to manage the estate for them. However his nephew Thomas Jones contested the will in the Court of Chancery. By 1828, the estate had largely been dissipated by lawsuits and poor management. His corpse, in its distinctive iron coffin, was moved several times over the next decades, but is now lost.

<text>Betty Helena Williams (née Williams; born 31 July 1944) is a Welsh Labour politician, who was the Member of Parliament for Conwy from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
Williams was born in St David&#x27;s Hospital, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales. She attended Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle in Penygroes, near Caernarfon, and also attended Bangor Normal College.

Her political career began in 1967 when she was elected to become a member of the Llanllyfni Parish Council. She proceeded to serve as a district councillor, and more recently in 1990 as Mayor of Arfon.

Williams is a former chair of a community centre, as well as a former Christian Aid and Meals on Wheels organiser, and an Honorary Fellow of the University of Wales, Bangor. She worked as a secretary and freelance journalist.

==Parliamentary career==
Williams contested Caernarfon in 1983 and Conwy in 1987 and 1992. In 1995, she was again selected to stand for election for Labour in Conwy, though this time through an all-women shortlist.

She was a member of the Parliamentary Labour Party committees on education and employment; health and social services, and culture, media and sport. In 2009 she supported Carwyn Jones in the election for First Minister, strongly criticising his opponent Edwina Hart for dismissing suggestions that the First Minister needed to be able to speak the Welsh language. Williams said: &quot;“I think it’s important that we have someone who is bilingual as First Minister of Wales, like we’ve had with Rhodri who can conduct interviews through the medium of Welsh or English.”

She was also a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Groups in the House of Commons covering children in Wales, primary headache disorders, maternity, multiple sclerosis and vaccine-damaged children.

In September 2008, Williams announced that she would not be contesting her parliamentary seat at the 2010 general election. She stated that this was due to her wanting to &#x27;change the balance&#x27; of her workload.

==Personal life==
Williams was married to Evan Williams with two sons; Williams is both her married and maiden name. She has a BA from the University of Wales. Her interests include opera and sheepdog trials. Her husband Evan died on 10 April 2020 of complications of COVID-19, after twice being tested negative for the disease.

<text>George Philip Willis, Baron Willis of Knaresborough (born 30 November 1941, Burnley) is a politician in the United Kingdom. He is a Liberal Democrat member of the House of Lords, and was Member of Parliament (MP) for Harrogate and Knaresborough from 1997 until retiring at the 2010 general election. Up to that date he was the chair of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee.

==Early life==
He attended Burnley Grammar School and the City of Leeds and Carnegie College, where he gained a Cert Ed in 1963. From 1963 to 1965 he was a teacher at Middleton County Secondary Boys&#x27; School; Head of History at Moor Grange County Secondary Boys&#x27; School from 1965 to 1967; Senior Master at Primrose Hill High School, Mabgate, from 1967 to 1974; and Deputy Head at West Leeds Boys&#x27; Grammar School from 1974 to 1978. In 1978, he gained a BPhil in Education from the University of Birmingham. Moving from Leeds to Teesside, he was Head Teacher of Ormesby School in Netherfields from 1978 to 1982, then moved back to Leeds to become Head Teacher of John Smeaton Community High School in Pendas Fields from 1983 to 1997.

==Parliamentary career==
He was first elected in 1997, beating Norman Lamont, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and was re-elected with increased majorities in 2001 and 2005. In May 2007 announced his decision to step down as an MP at the next general election, although he said that he would have stood again if a snap election had been called.

From 1999 to 2005, Willis was the Liberal Democrat Shadow Education and Skills Secretary, having previously served as Higher Education spokesman and acting spokesman on Northern Ireland. Following the 2005 general election, he was appointed chair of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, succeeding Labour&#x27;s Ian Gibson.

In 2006, he stated that he would force an election for the party leadership by standing if there would otherwise be only one candidate. As two further candidates came forward to challenge the eventual winner, Sir Menzies Campbell, Willis did not stand. Campbell&#x27;s victory left a vacancy for the post of deputy leader. Willis considered running in the deputy leadership election but did not submit a nomination.

At the Liberal Democrat Federal Conference in Spring 2007 (held in his home seat of Harrogate) he proposed a change to official Liberal Democrat policy on the future of Trident in an amendment to commit the party to getting rid of Britain&#x27;s nuclear deterrent. The amendment was opposed by the party leadership and, in one of the closest votes in recent years at a Federal Conference, the amendment was defeated by 454 votes to 414.

In September 2008, Mr Willis provoked the resignation of Professor Michael Reiss from his position as Director of Education at the Royal Society (on secondment from the Institute of Education). Professor Reiss, in a speech to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, had commented that in his experience as a teacher, children with creationist views were difficult to persuade otherwise, and that merely silencing them didn&#x27;t cause them to change their minds at all. He suggested an alternative approach: that such pupils should be allowed to express their opinions, not as science, but as &#x27;a world view&#x27;. This would provide the opportunity for real discussion and science teaching. Willis demanded action by the Royal Society against Professor Reiss, so stimulating a furore which concluded with Reiss&#x27; resignation on 17 September.

==Peerage==
On 18 June 2010, Willis was created a life peer with the title Baron Willis of Knaresborough, &quot;of Harrogate in the County of North Yorkshire&quot; and was introduced in the House of Lords on 7 July 2010. Willis was appointed by the Royal College of Nursing to lead the Willis Commission on the future of Nursing Education. The report &quot;Quality with Compassion: the future of nursing education was&quot; published in 2012.

==Personal life==
He is a keen supporter of Burnley Football Club. He married Heather Sellars in 1974 in Staincliffe. They have a daughter Rachel (born 1975) and a son (born 1980). His daughter Rachel is a television personality best known for her role of Connie, the so-called &quot;AOL lady&quot; in the AOL adverts, a role which she played from 1998 to 2003. Although from Burnley, he has lived in the Yorkshire area for many years.
