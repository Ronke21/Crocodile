<text>Macedonians ( ) are a nation and a South Slavic ethnic group native to the region of Macedonia in Southeast Europe. They speak Macedonian, a South Slavic language. The large majority of Macedonians identify as Eastern Orthodox Christians, who share a cultural and historical &quot;Orthodox Byzantine–Slavic heritage&quot; with their neighbours. About two-thirds of all ethnic Macedonians live in North Macedonia; there are also communities in a number of other countries.

The concept of a Macedonian ethnicity, distinct from their Orthodox Balkan neighbours, is seen to be a comparatively newly emergent one. The earliest manifestations of an incipient Macedonian identity emerged during the second half of the 19th century among limited circles of Slavic-speaking intellectuals, predominantly outside the region of Macedonia. They arose after the First World War and especially during the 1930s, and thus were consolidated by Communist Yugoslavia&#x27;s governmental policy after the Second World War.
The formation of the ethnic Macedonians as a separate community has been shaped by population displacement as well as by language shift, both the result of the political developments in the region of Macedonia during the 20th century. Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the decisive point in the ethnogenesis of the South Slavic ethnic group was the creation of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia after World War II, a state in the framework of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This was followed by the development of a separate Macedonian language and national literature, and the foundation of a distinct Macedonian Orthodox Church and national historiography.

==History==
===Ancient and Roman period===
In antiquity, much of central-northern Macedonia (the Vardar basin) was inhabited by Paionians who expanded from the lower Strymon basin. The Pelagonian plain was inhabited by the Pelagones and the Lyncestae, ancient Greek tribes of Upper Macedonia; whilst the western region (Ohrid-Prespa) was said to have been inhabited by Illyrian tribes, such as the Enchelae. During the late Classical Period, having already developed several sophisticated &quot;polis&quot;-type settlements and a thriving economy based on mining, Paeonia became a constituent province of the Argead – Macedonian kingdom. In 310 BC, the Celts attacked deep into the south, subduing various local tribes, such as the Dardanians, the Paeonians and the Triballi. Roman conquest brought with it a significant Romanization of the region. During the Dominate period, &#x27;barbarian&#x27; foederati were settled on Macedonian soil at times; such as the Sarmatians settled by Constantine the Great (330s AD) or the (10 year) settlement of Alaric I&#x27;s Goths. In contrast to &#x27;frontier provinces&#x27;, Macedonia (north and south) continued to be a flourishing Christian, Roman province in Late Antiquity and into the Early Middle Ages.

===Medieval period===
Linguistically, the South Slavic languages from which Macedonian developed are thought to have expanded in the region during the post-Roman period, although the exact mechanisms of this linguistic expansion remains a matter of scholarly discussion. Traditional historiography has equated these changes with the commencement of raids and &#x27;invasions&#x27; of Sclaveni and Antes from Wallachia and western Ukraine during the 6th and 7th centuries. However, recent anthropological and archaeological perspectives have viewed the appearance of Slavs in Macedonia, and throughout the Balkans in general, as part of a broad and complex process of transformation of the cultural, political and ethnolinguistic Balkan landscape before the collapse of Roman authority. The exact details and chronology of population shifts remain to be determined. What is beyond dispute is that, in contrast to &quot;barbarian&quot; Bulgaria, northern Macedonia remained Roman in its cultural outlook into the 7th century. Yet at the same time, sources attest numerous Slavic tribes in the environs of Thessaloniki and further afield, including the Berziti in Pelagonia. Apart from Slavs and late Byzantines, Kuver&#x27;s &quot;Sermesianoi&quot; – a mix of Byzantine Greeks, Bulgars and Pannonian Avars – settled the &quot;Keramissian plain&quot; (Pelagonia) around Bitola in the late 7th century. Later pockets of settlers included &quot;Danubian&quot; Bulgars in the 9th century; Magyars (Vardariotai) and Armenians in the 10th–12th centuries, Cumans and Pechenegs in the 11th–13th centuries, and Saxon miners in the 14th and 15th centuries. Vlachs (Aromanians) and Arbanasi (Albanians) also inhabited this area in the Middle ages and mingeled with the local Slavic-speakers.

Having previously been Byzantine clients, the &quot;Sklaviniae&quot; of Macedonia switched their allegiance to the Bulgarians with their incorporation into the Bulgarian Empire in the mid-800s. In the 860s, Byzantine missionaries Cyril and Methodius created the Glagolitic alphabet and Slavonic liturgy based on the Slavic dialect around Thessaloniki for a mission to Great Moravia. After the demise of the Great Moravian mission in 886, exiled students of the two apostles brought the Glagolitic alphabet to the Bulgarian Empire, where Khan Boris I of Bulgaria () welcomed them. As part of his efforts to limit Byzantine influence and assert Bulgarian independence, he adopted Slavic as official ecclesiastical and state language and established the Preslav Literary School and Ohrid Literary School, which taught Slavonic liturgy and the Glagolitic and subsequently the Cyrillic alphabet. The success of Boris I&#x27;s efforts was a major factor in making the Slavs in Macedonia—and the other Slavs within the First Bulgarian State—into Bulgarians and transforming the Bulgar state into a Bulgarian state. Subsequently, the literary and ecclesiastical centre in Ohrid became a second cultural capital of medieval Bulgaria.

=== Ottoman period ===
After the final Ottoman conquest of the Balkans by the Ottomans in the 14th/15th century, all Eastern Orthodox Christians were included in a specific ethno-religious community under &quot;Graeco-Byzantine&quot; jurisdiction called Rum Millet. Belonging to this religious commonwealth was so important that most of the common people began to identify themselves as &quot;Christians&quot;. However, ethnonyms never disappeared and some form of primary ethnic identity was available. This is confirmed from a Sultan&#x27;s Firman from 1680 which describes the ethnic groups in the Balkan territories of the Empire as follows: Greeks, Albanians, Serbs, Vlachs and Bulgarians.

Throughout the Middle Ages and Ottoman rule up until the early 20th century the Slavic-speaking population majority in the region of Macedonia were more commonly referred to (both by themselves and outsiders) as Bulgarians. However, in pre-nationalist times, terms such as &quot;Bulgarian&quot; did not possess a strict ethno-nationalistic meaning, rather, they were loose, often interchangeable terms which could simultaneously denote regional habitation, allegiance to a particular empire, religious orientation, membership in certain social groups. Similarly, a &quot;Byzantine&quot; was a &quot;Roman&quot; subject of Constantinople, and the term bore no strict ethnic connotations, Greek or otherwise. Overall, in the Middle Ages, &quot;a person&#x27;s origin was distinctly regional&quot;, and in the Ottoman era, before the 19th-century rise of nationalism, it was based on the corresponding confessional community.

The rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century brought opposition to this continued situation. At that time, the classical Rum Millet began to degrade. The coordinated actions, carried out by Bulgarian national leaders and supported by the majority of the Slavic-speaking population in today&#x27;s Republic of North Macedonia (the second anti-Greek revolt was in Skopje) to have a separate &quot;Bulgarian Millet&quot;, finally bore fruit in 1870 when a firman for the creation of the Bulgarian Exarchate was issued. In September 1872, the Ecumenical Patriarch Anthimus VI declared the Exarchate schismatic and excommunicated its adherents, accusing them of having &quot;surrendered Orthodoxy to ethnic nationalism&quot;, i.e., &quot;ethnophyletism&quot; (). At the time of its creation, the only Vardar Macedonian bishopric included in the Exarchate was Veles.

However, in 1874, the Christian population of the bishoprics of Skopje and Ohrid were given the chance to participate in a plebiscite, where they voted overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Exarchate (Skopje by 91%, Ohrid by 97%) Referring to the results of the plebiscites, and on the basis of statistical and ethnological indications, the 1876 Conference of Constantinople included all of present-day North Macedonia (except for the Debar region) and parts of present-day Greek Macedonia. The borders of new Bulgarian state, drawn by the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano, also included Macedonia, but the treaty was never put into effect and the Treaty of Berlin (1878) &quot;returned&quot; Macedonia to the Ottoman Empire.

For Christian Slav peasants, however, the choice between the Patriarchate and the Exarchate was not tainted with national meaning, but was a choice of Church or millet. Thus adherence to the Bulgarian national cause was attractive as a means of opposing oppressive Christian chiflik owners and urban merchants, who usually identified with the Greek nation, as a way to escape arbitrary taxation by Patriarchate bishops, via shifting allegiance to the Exarchate and on account of the free (and, occasionally, even subsidized) provision of education in Bulgarian schools. Alignment of the Slavs of Macedonia with the Bulgarian, the Greek or sometimes the Serbian national camp did not imply adherence to different national ideologies: these camps were not stable, culturally distinct groups, but parties with national affiliations, described by contemporaries as &quot;sides&quot;, &quot;wings&quot;, &quot;parties&quot; or &quot;political clubs&quot;.

===Identity===
The first expressions of Macedonian nationalism occurred in the second half of the 19th century mainly among intellectuals in Belgrade, Sofia, Thessaloniki and St. Petersburg. Since the 1850s some Slavic intellectuals from the area adopted the Greek designation &quot;Macedonian&quot; as a regional label, and it began to gain popularity. In the 1860s, according to Petko Slaveykov, some young intellectuals from Macedonia were claiming that they are not Bulgarians, but rather Macedonians, descendants of the Ancient Macedonians. Slaveikov, himself with Macedonian roots, started in 1866 the publication of the newspaper &quot;Makedoniya&quot;. Its main task was &quot;to educate these misguided [sic] &quot;Grecomans&quot; there&quot;, who he called also &quot;Macedonists&quot;. In a letter written to the Bulgarian Exarch in February 1874 Petko Slaveykov reports that discontent with the current situation &quot;has given birth among local patriots to the disastrous idea of working independently on the advancement of their own local dialect and what&#x27;s more, of their own, separate Macedonian church leadership.&quot; The activities of these people were also registered by the Serbian politician Stojan Novaković, who promoted the idea to use the Macedonian nationalism in order to oppose the strong pro-Bulgarian sentiments in the area. The nascent Macedonian nationalism, illegal at home in the theocratic Ottoman Empire, and illegitimate internationally, waged a precarious struggle for survival against overwhelming odds: in appearance against the Ottoman Empire, but in fact against the three expansionist Balkan states and their respective patrons among the great powers.

The first known author that overtly speaks of a Macedonian nationality and language was Georgi Pulevski, who in 1875 published in Belgrade a &quot;Dictionary of Three languages: Macedonian, Albanian, Turkish&quot;, in which he wrote that the Macedonians are a separate nation and the place which is theirs is called Macedonia. In 1880, he published in Sofia a &quot;Grammar of the language of the Slavic Macedonian population&quot;, a work that is today known as the first attempt at a grammar of Macedonian. However, he alternately described his language as &quot;Serbo-Albanian&quot; and &quot;Slavo-Macedonian&quot; and himself as a &quot;Mijak from Galičnik&quot;, a &quot;Serbian patriot&quot; and a &quot;Bulgarian from the village of Galičnik&quot;, i.e. changing ethnicity multiple times during his lifetime. Therefore, his Macedonian self-identification is considered by historians to be inchoate and to resemble a regional phenomenon. In 1885, Theodosius of Skopje, a priest who held a high-ranking position within the Bulgarian Exarchate, was chosen as a bishop of the episcopacy of Skopje. In 1890 he renounced de facto the Bulgarian Exarchate and attempted to restore the Archbishopric of Ohrid as a separate Macedonian Orthodox Church in all eparchies of Macedonia, responsible for the spiritual, cultural and educational life of all Macedonian Orthodox Christians. During this time period Metropolitan Bishop Theodosius of Skopje made a plea to the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople to allow a separate Macedonian church, and ultimately on 4 December 1891 he sent a to the Pope Leo XIII to ask for a and a from the Roman Catholic Church, but failed. Soon after, he repented and returned to pro-Bulgarian positions. In the 1880s and 1890s, Isaija Mažovski designated Macedonian Slavs as &quot;Macedonians&quot; and &quot;Old Slavic Macedonian people&quot;, and also distinguished them from Bulgarians as follows: &quot;Slavic-Bulgarian&quot; for Mažovski was synonymous with &quot;Macedonian&quot;, while only &quot;Bulgarian&quot; was a designation for the Bulgarians in Bulgaria.

In 1890, Austrian researcher of Macedonia Karl Hron reported that the Macedonians constituted a separate ethnic group by history and language. Within the next few years, this concept was also welcomed in Russia by linguists including Leonhard Masing, Pyotr Lavrov, Jan Baudouin de Courtenay, and Pyotr Draganov. Draganov, of Bulgarian descent, conducted research in Macedonia and determined that the local language had its own identifying characteristics compared to Bulgarian and Serbian. He wrote in a Saint Petersburg newspaper that the Macedonians should be recognized by Russia in a full national sense.

Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization leader Boris Sarafov in 1901 stated that Macedonians had a unique &quot;national element&quot; and, the following year, he stated &quot;We the Macedonians are neither Serbs nor Bulgarians, but simply Macedonians... Macedonia exists only for the Macedonians.&quot; However after the failure of the Ilinden Uprising, Sarafov wanted to keep closer ties with Bulgaria, supporting the Bulgarian aspirations towards the area. Gyorche Petrov, another IMRO member, stated Macedonia was a &quot;distinct moral unit&quot; with its own &quot;aspirations&quot;, while describing its Slavic population as Bulgarian.

===National antagonisms and Macedonian separatism===

====Macedonian separatism====

In 1903, Krste Misirkov published in Sofia his book &quot;On Macedonian Matters&quot;, wherein he laid down the principles of the modern Macedonian nationhood and language. This book, written in the standardized central dialect of Macedonia, is considered by ethnic Macedonians as a milestone of the process of Macedonian awakening. Misirkov argued that the dialect of central Macedonia (Veles-Prilep-Bitola-Ohrid) should be adopted as a basis for a standard Macedonian literary language, in which Macedonians should write, study, and worship; the autocephalous Archbishopric of Ohrid should be restored; and the Slavic people of Macedonia should be recognized as a separate ethnic community, when the necessary historical circumstances would arise.

However, throughout the book, Misirkov lamented that &quot;no local Macedonian patriotism exists&quot; and stated that the Slavic Macedonian population had always called itself &quot;Bulgarian&quot;. He also claimed that it was first the Byzantine Greeks who starting calling the local Slavs &quot;Bulgarians&quot; because of their alliance with the Bulgars, during the incessant Byzantine–Bulgarian conflict which in the eyes of the Byzantine Greeks eventually forged both Slavs and Bulgars into one people with a Bulgarian name and a Slavonic language. Misirkov&#x27;s primary motivation for a separate Macedonian nationhood and language was Serbia and Bulgaria&#x27;s conflict over Macedonia, which according to Misirkov would eventually lead to its partition. Therefore, he argued, it would be better for both Macedonians and Bulgarians if there was a united Macedonian Macedonia than a partitioned Bulgarian one, where Bulgaria would not be allowed to go any further than the left bank of the Vardar. In 1905, he returned to a pro-Bulgarian stance and renounced the positions he espoused in &quot;On Macedonian Matters&quot;. Later in his life, Misirkov oscillated between a pro-Macedonist and Greater Bulgarian stance, including controversially claimed that all Macedonian and Torlakian dialects were, in fact, Bulgarian.

Another major figure of the Macedonian awakening was Dimitrija Čupovski, one of the founders of the Macedonian Literary Society, established in Saint Petersburg in 1902. One of the members was also Krste Misirkov. In 1905 the Society published &quot;Vardar&quot;, the first scholarly, scientific and literary journal in the central dialects of Macedonia, which later would contribute in the standardization of Macedonian language. In 1913, the Macedonian Literary Society submitted the Memorandum of Independence of Macedonia to the British Foreign Secretary and other European ambassadors, and it was printed in many European newspapers. In the period 1913–1914, Čupovski published the newspaper &quot;Македонскi Голосъ (Macedonian Voice)&quot; in which he and fellow members of the Saint Petersburg Macedonian Colony propagated the existence of a Macedonian people separate from the Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbs, and sought to popularize the idea for an independent Macedonian state.

====The &quot;Macedonian Slavs&quot; in cartography====
From 1878 until 1918, most independent European observers viewed the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians or as Macedonian Slavs, while their association with Bulgaria was almost universally accepted. Original manuscript versions of population data mentioned &quot;Macedonian Slavs&quot;, though the term was changed to &quot;Bulgarians&quot; in the official printing. Western publications usually presented the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians, as happened, partly for political reasons, in Serbian ones. Prompted by the publication of a Serbian map by Spiridon Gopčević claiming the Slavs of Macedonia as Serbs, a version of a Russian map, published in 1891, in a period of deterioration of Bulgarian-Russian relations, first presented Macedonia inhabited not by Bulgarians, but by Macedonian Slavs. Austrian-Hungarian maps followed suit in an effort to delegitimize the ambitions of Russophile Bulgaria, returning to presenting the Macedonian Slavs as Bulgarians when Austria-Bulgaria relations ameliorated, only to renege and employ the designation &quot;Macedonian Slavs&quot; when Bulgaria changed its foreign policy and Austria turned to envisaging an autonomous Macedonia under Austrian influence within the Murzsteg process.

The term &quot;Macedonian Slavs&quot; was used either as a middle solution between conflicting Serbian and Bulgarian claims, to denote an intermediary grouping of Slavs, associated with the Bulgarians, or to describe a separate Slavic group with no ethnic, national or political affiliation. The differentiation of ethnographic maps representing rival national views produced to satisfy the curiosity of European audience for the inhabitants of Macedonia, after the Ilinden uprising of 1903, indicated the complexity of the issue. Influenced by the conclusions of the research of young Serb Jovan Cvijić, that Macedonia&#x27;s culture combined Byzantine influence with Serbian traditions, a map of 1903 by Austrian cartographer Karl Peucker depicted Macedonia as a peculiar area, where zones of linguistic influence overlapped. In his first ethnographic map of 1906, Cvijic presented all Slavs of Serbia and Macedonia merely as &quot;Slavs&quot;. In a pamphlet translated and circulated in Europe the same year, he elaborated his ostensibly impartial views and described the Slavs living south of the Babuna and Plačkovica mountains as &quot;Macedo-Slavs&quot; arguing that the appellation &quot;Bugari&quot; meant simply &quot;peasant&quot; to them, that they had no national consciousness and could become Serbs or Bulgarians in the future. Cvijić thus transformed the political character of the IMRO&#x27;s appeals to &quot;Macedonians&quot; into an ethnic one. Bulgarian cartographer Anastas Ishirkov countered Cvijić&#x27;s views, pointing to the involvement of Macedonian Slavs in Bulgarian nationalist uprisings and the Macedonian origins of Bulgarian nationalists before 1878. Although Cvijic&#x27;s arguments attracted the attention of Great Powers, they did not endorse at the time his view on the Macedo-Slavs.

Cvijić further elaborated the idea that had first appeared in Peucker&#x27;s map and in his map of 1909 he ingeniously mapped the Macedonian Slavs as a third group distinct from Bulgarians and Serbians, and part of them &quot;under Greek influence&quot;. Envisioning a future agreement with Greece, Cvijic depicted the southern half of the Macedo-Slavs &quot;under Greek unfluence&quot;, while leaving the rest to appear as a subset of the Serbo-Croats. Cvijić&#x27;s view was reproduced without acknowledgement by Alfred Stead, with no effect on British opinion, but, reflecting the reorientation of Serbian aims towards dividing Macedonia with Greece, Cvijić eliminated the Macedo-Slavs from a subsequent edition of his map. However, in 1913, before the conclusion of the Treaty of Bucharest he published his third ethnographic map distinguishing the Macedo-Slavs between Skopje and Salonica from both Bulgarians and Serbo-Croats, on the basis of the transitional character of their dialect per the linguistic researches of Vatroslav Jagić and Aleksandar Belić, and the Serb features of their customs, such as the zadruga. For Cvijić, the Macedo-Slavs were a transitional population, with any sense of nationality they displayed being weak, superficial, externally imposed and temporary. Despite arguing that they should be considered neutral, he postulated their division into Serbs and Bulgarians based on dialectical and cultural features in anticipation of Serbian demands regarding the delimitation of frontiers.

A Balkan committee of experts rejected Cvijić&#x27;s concept of the Macedo-Slavs in 1914. However, Bulgaria&#x27;s entry into World War I on the side of the Central Powers in 1915, after the Allies failed to convince Serbia to hand over the &quot;‘Uncontested Zone’&quot; in Macedonia to Bulgaria, precipitated a complete turnaround in the Allies&#x27; opinion of Macedonian ethnography, and several British and French maps echoing Cvijić were released within months. Thus, as the Entente approached victory in the First World War, a number other maps and atlases, including those produced by the Allies replicated Cvijić&#x27;s ideas, especially its depiction of the Macedo-Slavs. The prevalence of the Yugoslav point of view, obliged Georgios Sotiriades, a professor of History at the University of Athens, to map the Macedo-Slavs as a distinct group in his work of 1918, that mirrored Greek views of the time and was used as an official document to advocate for Greece&#x27;s positions in the Paris peace conference. After World War I, Cvijić&#x27;s map became the point of reference for all Balkan ethnographic maps, while his concept of Macedo-Slavs was reproduced in almost all maps, including German maps, that acknowledged a Macedonian nation.

===Macedonian Nationalism and Interwar Communism===
After the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and the World War I (1914–1918), following the division of the region of Macedonia amongst the Kingdom of Greece, the Kingdom of Bulgaria and the Kingdom of Serbia, the idea of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation was further spread among the Slavic-speaking population. The suffering during the wars, the endless struggle of the Balkan monarchies for dominance over the population increased the Macedonians&#x27; sentiment that the institutionalization of an independent Macedonian nation would put an end to their suffering. On the question of whether they were Serbs or Bulgarians, the people more often started answering: &quot;Neither Bulgar, nor Serb... I am Macedonian only, and I&#x27;m sick of war.&quot; Stratis Myrivilis noted a specific instance of a Slav-speaking family wanting to be referred to, not as &quot;Bulgar, Srrp, or Grrts&quot;, but as &quot;Makedon ortodox&quot;. By the 1920s, following a negative reaction to the national proselytization of the previous decades, a majority of Christian Slavs inhabiting Greek and Vardar Macedonia used the collective name &quot;Macedonians&quot; to describe themselves, either as a nation or as a distinct ethnicity. The 1928 Greek census recorded 81,844 Slavo-Macedonian speakers, distinct from 16,755 Bulgarian speakers. In 1924 the &quot;Politis–Kalfov Protocol&quot; was signed between Greece and Bulgaria, concerning the protection of the Bulgarian minority In Greece. However, it was not ratified by the Greek side, because public opinion stood against the recognition of any “Bulgarian” minority&quot;. Prior to the 1930s, &quot;it seems to have been acceptable&quot; for Greeks to refer to Slavophones of Macedonia as Macedonians and their language as Macedonian. Ion Dragoumis had argued this viewpoint.
The consolidation of an international Communist organization (the Comintern) in the 1920s led to some failed attempts by the Communists to use the Macedonian Question as a political weapon. In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%), mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called May Manifesto, in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required. In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United) was created, composed of former left-wing Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) members. This organization promoted for the first time in 1932 the existence of a separate ethnic Macedonian nation. In 1933 the Communist Party of Greece, in a series of articles published in its official newspaper, the &quot;Rizospastis&quot;, criticizing Greek minority policy towards Slavic-speakers in Greek Macedonia, recognized the Slavs of the entire region of Macedonia as forming a distinct Macedonian ethnicity and their language as Macedonian. The idea of a Macedonian nation was internationalized and backed by the Comintern which issued in 1934 a resolution supporting the development of the entity. This action was attacked by the IMRO, but was supported by the Balkan communists. The Balkan communist parties supported the national consolidation of the ethnic Macedonian people and created Macedonian sections within the parties, headed by prominent IMRO (United) members.

===World War II and Yugoslav nation-state building===
The sense of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation gained credence during World War II when ethnic Macedonian communist partisan detachments were formed. In 1943 the Communist Party of Macedonia was established and the resistance movement grew up. On the other hand, due to the different trajectories of Macedonian Slavs in the three nation-states that ruled the region, the designation &quot;Macedonian&quot; acquired different meanings for them by the time of the National Liberation War of Macedonia in the 1940s. According to historian Ivan Katardžiev those who came from the Bulgarian part or were members of the IMRO (United) practically felt themselves as Bulgarians, while those who had experienced Serbian rule and had interacted with the Croatian and Slovenian national movements within Yugoslavia had developed a stronger Macedonian consciousness. After the World War II ethnic Macedonian institutions were created in the three parts of the region of Macedonia, then under communist control, including the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ).

The available data indicates that despite the policy of assimilation, pro-Bulgarian sentiments among the Macedonian Slavs in Yugoslavia were still sizable during the interwar period. However, if the Yugoslavians would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in post-World War II Macedonia, Yugoslavia&#x27;s state policy of forced Serbianisation was changed with a new one — of Macedonization. The codification of Macedonian and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any Bulgarophilia among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As a result, Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt &quot;de-Bulgarization&quot; of the people in the PR Macedonia, such as it already had conducted in the Vardar Banovina during the Interwar period. Bulgarian sources claim around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special &quot;Law for the Protection of Macedonian National Honour&quot;, and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in a strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which during the times of Communist Yugoslavia, increased to the level of state policy. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.

===Contemporary state of identity and polemics===

Following the collapse of Yugoslavia, the issue of Macedonian identity emerged again. Nationalists and governments alike from neighbouring countries, especially Greece and Bulgaria, espouse the view that the Macedonian ethnicity is a modern, artificial creation. Such views have been seen by Macedonian historians to represent irredentist motives on Macedonian territory. Moreover, some historians point out that &quot;all&quot; modern nations are recent, politically motivated constructs based on creation &quot;myths&quot;, that the creation of Macedonian identity is &quot;no more or less artificial than any other identity&quot;, and that, contrary to the claims of Romantic nationalists, modern, territorially bound and mutually exclusive nation-states have little in common with their preceding large territorial or dynastic medieval empires, and any connection between them is tenuous at best. In any event, irrespective of shifting political affiliations, the Macedonian Slavs shared in the fortunes of the Byzantine commonwealth and the Rum millet and they can claim them as their heritage. Loring Danforth states similarly, the ancient heritage of modern Balkan countries is not &quot;the mutually exclusive property of one specific nation&quot; but &quot;the shared inheritance of all Balkan peoples&quot;.

A more radical and uncompromising strand of Macedonian nationalism has recently emerged called &quot;ancient Macedonism&quot;, or &quot;Antiquisation&quot;. Proponents of this view see modern Macedonians as direct descendants of the ancient Macedonians. This view faces criticism by academics as it is not supported by archaeology or other historical disciplines and also could marginalize the Macedonian identity. Surveys on the effects of the controversial nation-building project Skopje 2014 and on the perceptions of the population of Skopje revealed a high degree of uncertainty regarding the latter&#x27;s national identity. A supplementary national poll showed that there was a great discrepancy between the population&#x27;s sentiment and the narrative the state sought to promote.

Additionally, during the last two decades, tens of thousands of citizens of North Macedonia have applied for Bulgarian citizenship. In the period since 2000 more than 100,000 acquired it, while ca. 50,000 applied and are still waiting. Bulgaria has a special ethnic dual-citizenship regime which makes a constitutional distinction between &quot;ethnic Bulgarians&quot; and &quot;Bulgarian citizens&quot;. In the case of the Macedonians, merely declaring their national identity as Bulgarian is enough to gain a citizenship. By making the procedure simpler, Bulgaria stimulates more Macedonian citizens (of Slavic origin) to apply for a Bulgarian citizenship. However, many Macedonians who apply for Bulgarian citizenship as &quot;Bulgarians by origin&quot;, have few ties with Bulgaria. Further, those applying for Bulgarian citizenship usually say they do so to gain access to member states of the European Union rather than to assert Bulgarian identity. This phenomenon is called &quot;placebo identity&quot;. Some Macedonians view the Bulgarian policy as part of a strategy to destabilize the Macedonian national identity. As a nation engaged in a dispute over its distinctiveness from Bulgarians, Macedonians have always perceived themselves as threatened by their neighbor. Bulgaria insists its neighbor admit the common historical roots of their languages and nations, a view Skopje continues to reject. As a result, Bulgaria blocked the official start of EU accession talks with North Macedonia.

Despite sizable number of Macedonians that have acquired Bulgarian citizenship since 2002 (ca. 9.7% of the Slavic population), only 3,504 citizens of North Macedonia declared themselves as ethnic Bulgarians in the 2021 census (roughly 0.31% from the Slavic population). The Bulgarian side does not accept these results as completely objective, citing as an example the census has counted less than 20,000 people with Bulgarian citizenship in the country, while in fact they are over 100,000.

==Ethnonym==
The national name derives from the Greek term &quot;Makedonía&quot;, related to the name of the region, named after the ancient Macedonians and their kingdom. It originates from the ancient Greek adjective makednos, meaning &quot;tall&quot;, which shares its roots with the adjective &quot;makrós&quot;, meaning the same. The name is originally believed to have meant either &quot;highlanders&quot; or &quot;the tall ones&quot;, possibly descriptive of these ancient people. In the Late Middle Ages the name of Macedonia had different meanings for Western Europeans and for the Balkan people. For the Westerners it denoted the historical territory of the Ancient Macedonia, but for the Balkan Christians, it covered the territories of the former Byzantine province of Macedonia, situated around modern Turkish Edirne.

With the conquest of the Balkans by the Ottomans in the late 14th century, the name of Macedonia disappeared as a geographical designation for several centuries. The name was revived just during the early 19th century, after the foundation of the modern Greek state with its Western Europe-derived obsession with Ancient Greece. As a result of the rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, massive Greek religious and school propaganda occurred, and a process of &quot;Hellenization&quot; was implemented among Slavic-speaking population of the area. In this way, the name &quot;Macedonians&quot; was applied to the local Slavs, aiming to stimulate the development of close ties between them and the Greeks, linking both sides to the ancient Macedonians, as a counteract against the growing Bulgarian cultural influence into the region.

Although the local intellectuals initially rejected the Macedonian designation as Greek, since the 1850s some of them, adopted it as a regional identity, and this name began to gain popularity. Serbian politics then, also encouraged this kind of regionalism to neutralize the Bulgarian influx, thereby promoting Serbian interests there. The local educator Kuzman Shapkarev concluded that since the 1870s this foreign ethnonym began to replace the traditional one &quot;Bulgarians&quot;. At the dawn of the 20th century the Bulgarian teacher Vasil Kanchov marked that the local Bulgarians and Koutsovlachs call themselves Macedonians, and the surrounding people also call them in the same way. During the interbellum Bulgaria also supported to some extent the Macedonian &quot;regional identity&quot;, especially in Yugoslavia. Its aim was to prevent the Serbianization of the local Slavic speakers, because the very name &quot;Macedonia&quot; was prohibited in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Ultimately the designation Macedonian, changed its status in 1944, and went from being predominantly a regional, ethnographic denomination, to a national one.

==Population==

The vast majority of Macedonians live along the valley of the river Vardar, the central region of the Republic of North Macedonia. They form about 64.18% of the population of North Macedonia (1,297,981 people according to the 2002 census). Smaller numbers live in eastern Albania, northern Greece, and southern Serbia, mostly abutting the border areas of the Republic of North Macedonia. A large number of Macedonians have immigrated overseas to Australia, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and to many European countries: Germany, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Austria among others.

===Balkans===
====Greece====
The existence of an ethnic Macedonian minority in Greece is rejected by the Greek government. The number of people speaking Slavic dialects has been estimated at somewhere between 10,000 and 250,000. Most of these people however do not have an ethnic Macedonian national consciousness, with most choosing to identify as ethnic Greeks or rejecting both ethnic designations and preferring terms such as &quot;natives&quot; instead. In 1999 the Greek Helsinki Monitor estimated that the number of people identifying as ethnic Macedonians numbered somewhere between 10,000 and 30,000, Macedonian sources generally claim the number of ethnic Macedonians living in Greece at somewhere between 200,000 and 350,000. The ethnic Macedonians in Greece have faced difficulties from the Greek government in their ability to self-declare as members of a &quot;Macedonian minority&quot; and to refer to their native language as &quot;Macedonian&quot;.

Since the late 1980s there has been an ethnic Macedonian revival in Northern Greece, mostly centering on the region of Florina. Since then ethnic Macedonian organisations including the Rainbow political party have been established. &quot;Rainbow&quot; first opened its offices in Florina on 6 September 1995. The following day, the offices had been broken into and had been ransacked. Later Members of &quot;Rainbow&quot; had been charged for &quot;causing and inciting mutual hatred among the citizens&quot; because the party had bilingual signs written in both Greek and Macedonian. On 20 October 2005, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) ordered the Greek government to pay penalties to the &quot;Rainbow Party&quot; for violations of 2 ECHR articles. &quot;Rainbow&quot; has seen limited success at a national level, its best result being achieved in the 1994 European elections, with a total of 7,263 votes. Since 2004 it has participated in European Parliament elections and local elections, but not in national elections. A few of its members have been elected in local administrative posts. &quot;Rainbow&quot; has recently re-established &quot;Nova Zora&quot;, a newspaper that was first published for a short period in the mid-1990s, with reportedly 20,000 copies being distributed free of charge.

====Serbia====
Within Serbia, Macedonians constitute an officially recognised ethnic minority at both a local and national level. Within Vojvodina, Macedonians are recognised under the Statute of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, along with other ethnic groups. Large Macedonian settlements within Vojvodina can be found in Plandište, Jabuka, Glogonj, Dužine and Kačarevo. These people are mainly the descendants of economic migrants who left the Socialist Republic of Macedonia in the 1950s and 1960s. The Macedonians in Serbia are represented by a national council and in recent years Macedonian has begun to be taught. The most recent census recorded 22,755 Macedonians living in Serbia.

====Albania====
Macedonians represent the second largest ethnic minority population in Albania. Albania recognises the existence of a Macedonian minority within the Mala Prespa region, most of which is comprised by Pustec Municipality. Macedonians have full minority rights within this region, including the right to education and the provision of other services in Macedonian. There also exist unrecognised Macedonian populations living in the Golo Brdo region, the &quot;Dolno Pole&quot; area near the town of Peshkopi, around Lake Ohrid and Korce as well as in Gora. 4,697 people declared themselves Macedonians in the 1989 census.

====Bulgaria====
Bulgarians are considered most closely related to the neighboring Macedonians, and it is sometimes claimed that there is no clear ethnic difference between them. A total of 1,143 people officially declared themselves to be ethnic Macedonians in the last Bulgarian census in 2021. During the same year, there were five times as many Bulgarian residents born in North Macedonia, 5,450. Most of them held Bulgarian citizenship, with only 1,576 of them being citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia. According to the 2011 Bulgarian census, there were 561 ethnic Macedonians (0.2%) in the Blagoevgrad Province, the Bulgarian part of the geographical region of Macedonia, out of a total of 1,654 Macedonians in the entire country. Also, a total of 429 citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia resided in the province.

In 1998, Krassimir Kanev, chairman of the non-governmental organization Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, claimed that there were 15,000–25,000 ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria (see here). In the same report, Macedonian nationalists (Popov et al., 1989) claimed that 200,000 ethnic Macedonians lived in Bulgaria. However, according to the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, the vast majority of the Slavic-speaking population in Pirin Macedonia had a Bulgarian national self-consciousness and a regional Macedonian identity similar to the Macedonian regional identity in Greek Macedonia. According to ethnic Macedonian political activist, Stoyko Stoykov, the number of Bulgarian citizens with ethnic Macedonian self-consciousness in 2009 was between 5,000 and 10,000. In 2000, the Bulgarian Constitutional Court banned UMO Ilinden-Pirin, a small Macedonian political party, as a separatist organization. Subsequently, activists attempted to re-establish the party but could not gather the required number of signatures.

===Diaspora===

Significant Macedonian communities can also be found in the traditional immigrant-receiving nations, as well as in Western European countries. Census data in many European countries (such as Italy and Germany) does not take into account the ethnicity of émigrés from the Republic of North Macedonia.

====Argentina====
Most Macedonians can be found in Buenos Aires, the Pampas and Córdoba. An estimated 30,000 Macedonians can be found in Argentina.

====Australia====

The official number of Macedonians in Australia by birthplace or birthplace of parents is 83,893 (2001). The main Macedonian communities are found in Melbourne, Geelong, Sydney, Wollongong, Newcastle, Canberra and Perth. The 2006 census recorded 83,983 people of Macedonian ancestry and the 2011 census recorded 93,570 people of Macedonian ancestry.

====Brazil====
An estimated 45,000 people in Brazil are of Macedonian ancestry. The Macedonians can be primarily found in Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Curitiba.

====Canada====

The Canadian census in 2001 records 37,705 individuals claimed wholly or partly Macedonian heritage in Canada, although community spokesmen have claimed that there are actually 100,000–150,000 Macedonians in Canada.

====United States====

A significant Macedonian community can be found in the United States. The official number of Macedonians in the US is 49,455 (2004). The Macedonian community is located mainly in Michigan, New York, Ohio, Indiana and New Jersey

====Germany====

There are an estimated 61,000 citizens of North Macedonia in Germany (mostly in the Ruhrgebiet) (2001).

====Italy====
There are 74,162 citizens of North Macedonia in Italy (Foreign Citizens in Italy).

====Switzerland====

In 2006 the Swiss Government recorded 60,362 Macedonian Citizens living in Switzerland.

====Romania====

Macedonians are an officially recognised minority group in Romania. They have a special reserved seat in the nation&#x27;s parliament. In 2002, they numbered 731.

====Slovenia====

Macedonians began relocating to Slovenia in the 1950s when the two regions formed a part of a single country, Yugoslavia.

====Other countries====
Sizeable Macedonian communities can also be found in the United Kingdom, as well as in European Union countries, like the Netherlands, Austria and France.

==Culture==

The culture of the people is characterized with both traditionalist and modernist attributes. It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as Balkanic, closely related to that of Bulgarians and Serbs.

===Architecture===
The typical Macedonian village house is influenced by Ottoman Architecture. Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.

The stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white façade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.

===Cinema and theater===
The history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by Janaki and Milton Manaki in Bitola. In 1995 &quot;Before the Rain&quot; became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.

From 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in Prilep in honor of Vojdan Černodrinski, the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in Kočani.

===Music and art===
Macedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring Balkan countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.

The founders of modern Macedonian painting included Lazar Licenovski, Nikola Martinoski, Dimitar Pandilov, and Vangel Kodzoman. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of Borka Lazeski, Dimitar Kondovski, Petar Mazev who are now deceased, and Rodoljub Anastasov and many others who are still active. Others include: Vasko Taskovski and Vangel Naumovski. In addition to Dimo Todorovski, who is considered to be the founder of modern Macedonian sculpture, the works of Petar Hadzi Boskov, Boro Mitrikeski, Novak Dimitrovski and Tome Serafimovski are also outstanding.

===Economy===
In the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, middle and heavy industries were started.

===Language===
Macedonian () is a member of the Eastern group of South Slavic languages. Standard Macedonian was implemented as the official language of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia after being codified in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving literary tradition.

The closest relative of Macedonian is Bulgarian, followed by Serbo-Croatian. All the South Slavic languages form a dialect continuum, in which Macedonian and Bulgarian form an Eastern subgroup. The Torlakian dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost dialects of Macedonian as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia and western Bulgaria. Torlakian is often classified as part of the Eastern South Slavic dialects.

The Macedonian alphabet is an adaptation of the Cyrillic script, as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely Romanized.

===Religion===

Most Macedonians are members of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church – Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in exarchates in the Macedonian diaspora.

The church gained autonomy from the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic Archbishopric of Ohrid. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared autocephaly from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the Eastern Orthodox Communion. Thereafter, Macedonian Orthodox Church was not in communion with any Orthodox Church, until 2022 when it was reintegrated. A small number of Macedonians belong to the Roman Catholic and the Protestant churches.

Between the 15th and the 20th centuries, during Ottoman rule, a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as Macedonian Muslims, who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.

===Names===
===Cuisine===
Macedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the Balkans—reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.

Shopska salad, a food from Bulgaria, is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its dairy products, wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as rakija. Tavče Gravče and mastika are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.

==Symbols==
Symbols used by members of the ethnic group include:
* Lion: The lion first appears in the Fojnica Armorial from the 17th century, where the coat of arms of Macedonia is included among those of other entities. On the coat of arms is a crown; inside a yellow crowned lion is depicted standing rampant, on a red background. On the bottom enclosed in a red and yellow border is written &quot;Macedonia&quot;. The use of the lion to represent Macedonia was continued in foreign heraldic collections throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Nevertheless, during the late 19th century the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization arose, which modeled itself after the earlier Bulgarian revolutionary traditions and adopted their symbols as the lion, etc. Modern versions of the historical lion has also been added to the emblem of several political parties, organizations and sports clubs. However, this symbol is not totally accepted while the state coat of arms of Bulgaria is somewhat similar.

* Vergina Sun: (official flag, 1992–1995) The Vergina Sun is used unofficially by various associations and cultural groups in the Macedonian diaspora. The Vergina Sun is believed to have been associated with ancient Greek kings such as Alexander the Great and Philip II, although it was used as an ornamental design in ancient Greek art long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was depicted on a golden larnax found in a 4th-century BC royal tomb belonging to either Philip II or Philip III of Macedon in the Greek region of Macedonia. The Greeks regard the use of the symbol by North Macedonia as a misappropriation of a Hellenic symbol, unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II. However, archaeological items depicting the symbol have also been excavated in the territory of North Macedonia. Toni Deskoski, Macedonian professor of International Law, argues that the Vergina Sun is not a Macedonian symbol but it&#x27;s a Greek symbol that is used by Macedonians in the nationalist context of Macedonism and that the Macedonians need to get rid of it. In 1995, Greece lodged a claim for trademark protection of the Vergina Sun as a state symbol under WIPO. In Greece the symbol against a blue field is used vastly in the area of Macedonia and it has official status.The Vergina sun on a red field was the first flag of the independent Republic of Macedonia, until it was removed from the state flag under an agreement reached between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece in September 1995. On 17 June 2018, Greece and the Republic of Macedonia signed the Prespa Agreement, which stipulates the removal of the Vergina Sun&#x27;s public use across the latter&#x27;s territory. In a session held on early July 2019, the government of North Macedonia announced the complete removal of the Vergina Sun from all public areas, institutions and monuments in the country, with the deadline for its removal being set to 12 August 2019, in line with the Prespa Agreement.

== Genetics ==

Anthropologically, Macedonians possess genetic lineages postulated to represent Balkan prehistoric and historic demographic processes. Such lineages are also typically found in neighboring South Slavs such as Bulgarians and Serbs, in addition to Greeks, Albanians, Romanians and Gagauzes.

Y-DNA studies suggest that Macedonians along with neighboring South Slavs are distinct from other Slavic-speaking populations in Europe and near half of their Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups are likely to be inherited from inhabitants of the Balkans that predated sixth-century Slavic migrations. A diverse set of Y-DNA haplogroups are found in Macedonians at significant levels, including I2a1b, E-V13, J2a, R1a1, R1b, G2a, encoding a complex pattern of demographic processes. Similar distributions of the same haplogroups are found in neighboring populations. I2a1b and R1a1 are typically found in Slavic-speaking populations across Europe while haplogroups such as E-V13 and J2 occur at high frequencies in neighboring non-Slavic populations. On the other hand R1b is the most frequently occurring haplogroup in Western Europe and G2a is most frequently found in Caucasus and the adjacent areas. According to a DNA data for 17 Y-chromosomal STR loci in Macedonians, in comparison to other South Slavs and Kosovo Albanians, the Macedonian population had the lowest genetic (Y-STR) distance against the Bulgarian population while having the largest distance against the Croatian population. However, the observed populations did not have significant differentiation in Y-STR population structure, except partially for Kosovo Albanians. Genetic similarity, irrespective of language and ethnicity, has a strong correspondence to geographic proximity in European populations.

In regard to population genetics, not all regions of Southeastern Europe had the same ratio of native Byzantine and invading Slavic population, with the territory of the Eastern Balkans (Macedonia, Thrace and Moesia) having a significant percentage of locals compared to Slavs. Considering that the majority of Balkan Slavs came via the Eastern Carpathian route, lower percentage in the east does not imply that the number of the Slavs there was lesser than among the Western South Slavs. Most probably on the territory of Western South Slavs was a state of desolation which produced there a founder effect. The region of Macedonia suffered less disruption than frontier provinces closer to the Danube, with towns and forts close to Ohrid, Bitola and along the Via Egnatia. Re-settlements and the cultural links of the Byzantine Era further shaped the demographic processes which the Macedonian ancestry is linked to. Nevertheless, even present-day Peloponnesian Greeks carry a small, but significant amount of Slavic ancestry; the admixture ranged from 0.2% to 14.4%.

<doc id="432710" wikidata="Q1812146" url="?curid=432710" title="United Party (South Africa)">
<text>The United Party was a South African political party that was the ruling party from its formation in 1934 until 1948. Formed from the parties of Prime Ministers J. B. M. Hertzog and Jan Smuts, the United Party bridged white English-speakers, Afrikaners and Coloureds. It was considered more liberal on race relations than the National Party, which strongly supported the preservation of white supremacy. The United Party lost the 1948 general election to the National Party which subsequently implemented apartheid. The United Party never held power again and dissolved in 1977, with remnants forming the New Republic Party and other smaller groups.

==Formation==

The United Party was formed by a merger of the majority of Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog&#x27;s National Party with the rival South African Party of Jan Smuts, along with remnants of the Unionist Party. Its full name was the United National South African Party, but it was generally called the &quot;United Party&quot;. The party drew support from several different parts of South African society, including white English-speakers, Afrikaners and Coloureds.

Hertzog led the party until 1939, when he refused to commit South Africa to the British Empire&#x27;s war effort against Nazi Germany after World War II broke out. Most Afrikaners were hostile to the British and sympathetic towards Nazi Germany, and Hertzog felt that supporting Britain during the conflict would be unacceptable to Afrikaner opinion. He also claimed to not see much benefit for South Africa taking part in a war that Hertzog claimed was essentially a European affair. The majority of the United Party caucus were of a different mind, however, and Hertzog resigned. Smuts succeeded him and led the party and the country throughout World War II and the immediate post-war years.

==Decline==
Smuts and the United Party lost the 1948 election to the National Party. It never held power again. J. G. N. Strauss succeeded Smuts in 1950, and was in turn replaced by Sir de Villiers Graaff in 1956 until 1977. Attrition characterised his leadership years, as the party slowly declined because of electoral gerrymandering, changes to South Africa&#x27;s voting laws, including the removal of the &#x27;Coloureds&#x27; – South Africans of mixed ancestry, who had been staunch United Party supporters – from the electoral rolls, and defections to other parties such as the Progressive Party, which was formed in 1959 by liberal former UP members that sought a stronger opposition to apartheid. Despite this, the party remained relatively stable until the 1970s.
===National Conservative Party===

The National Conservative Party () existed in South Africa between 1954 and 1957. It was led by Bailey Bekker, after he and others split from the United Party. Five United Party members were expelled after the 1953 parliamentary session, including Bekker and Abraham Jonker, after they had criticised the party&#x27;s approach to the Cape Qualified Franchise which allowed some Cape Coloureds to vote in South African elections alongside Whites. They believed the party should compromise with the government and allow a separate electoral roll. They were conservative in outlook and regarded the United Party&#x27;s new leader JGN Strauss as taking it leftwards. They, and two other members, founded the &quot;National Conservative Party&quot; in 1954. The party did not prosper and dissolved in 1957 before the next election, with its members joining the National Party or rejoining the United Party, or retiring from politics.

===Schwarz breakaway===
There was much division in the party, between liberals and conservatives. Divisions came to a head in 1972 when Harry Schwarz, leader of the liberal &quot;Young Turks&quot; within the party, wrestled the leadership of the party in the Transvaal from Marais Steyn. His victory was a visible sign of strength from the liberals within the party. On 4 January 1974, he met with Mangosuthu Buthelezi and signed a five-point plan for racial peace in South Africa, which came to be known as the Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith. It was the first occasion in apartheid South Africa&#x27;s history where the principles of peaceful transition and equality had been enshrined in a document which had been jointly signed by acknowledged black and white political leaders in South Africa. The declaration, however provoked an angry response from the conservative &quot;Old Guard&quot; in the party, including the party&#x27;s leader.

In 1975 Harry Schwarz and three other Members of Parliament (MPs) were expelled from the United Party. Further resignations followed, which included two senators, ten members of the Transvaal Provincial Council, 14 out of the 36 Johannesburg City Councillors and four Randburg City Councillors. This made it the official opposition in the Transvaal Provincial Council. They formed the Reform Party which elected Schwarz as leader. Schwarz&#x27;s breakaway led to the demise of the United Party and realigned opposition politics in South Africa. The Reform Party soon merged with the Progressive Party to form the Progressive Reform Party (PRP).

In 1977, after merging with the Democratic Party, which had been formed by moderate NP dissidents, the United Party was renamed the New Republic Party. A significant number of its parliamentarians refused to remain with the renamed party. Some joined the anti-apartheid PRP (now called the Progressive Federal Party). Six MPs were expelled from the United Party for refusing to accept the plan to form the NRP and formed the South African Party which joined the ruling National Party three years later. Elections in late 1977 left the New Republic Party gutted, with only 10 parliamentary seats, down from the 41 held by the United Party.
==Political position and legacy==

The United Party did not articulate a position on race relations and tacitly supported apartheid in general, though Smuts suggested that if black politicians promote &quot;civilised&quot; conduct, black South Africans might someday share power with the white minority. The lack of clear policy on race relations contributed to the United Party&#x27;s loss in the 1948 election. The United Party was considered more liberal on the issue than the Nationalist Party, which supported the preservation of white supremacy at all costs.

The United Party was against apartheid as a system, but also favoured the continuation of white minority rule, akin to the political arrangements in Rhodesia at the time. During the late 1960s, the party tried to gain support by its resistance to the National Party&#x27;s politics on giving land to the Bantustans, insisting on a single citizenship for all South Africans. By the 1970s, the UP advocated federalism and a gradual retreat from official segregation and discrimination.

The party supported links with the Commonwealth of Nations, and unsuccessfully campaigned against the establishment of a republic in the whites-only referendum held on 5 October 1960.

By the late 1970s, the breakaway and successor groups of the United Party – the Progressive Federal Party, New Republic Party and South African Party – were more or less committed to a multiracial federation as a solution to the racial question. The ruling National Party&#x27;s reform program under PW Botha initially attracted some liberal support while provoking divisions within its ranks. By 1987, the NRP was in decline and its base absorbed by parties formed by NP dissidents; these merged with the PFP in 1989 to form the Democratic Party which is now the Democratic Alliance, thus reuniting the currents that originated in the United Party.

<doc id="432713" wikidata="Q3905" url="?curid=432713" title="Gladbeck">
<text>Gladbeck () is a town in the district of Recklinghausen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

Gladbeck is quite a young town, first recognised 21 July 1919 when it was given town rights. The town established itself around five farming villages, Brauck, Butendorf, Ellinghorst, Rentfort and Zweckel.

==Geography==
Gladbeck is located in the northern part of the Ruhr Area and belongs to the so-called Emscherzone in which mining started late in relation to other towns of this area. Gladbeck is predominantly surrounded by Bottrop, Gelsenkirchen, Dorsten and by Essen in the south.

==History==

===Pre-industrial society===

Early archeological finds prove that the region of Gladbeck was already populated as early as 2000 BC. It was first mentioned in 1020 as Gladbeki and was originally a small village of 300 inhabitants. The village with its five peasantries (Butendorf, Brauck, Rentfort, Ellinghorst and Zweckel, now quarters of Gladbeck) was arranged around St. Lamberti cathedral.

From 1180 to 1802 Gladbeck belonged to the Vest Recklinghausen and was thus linked with the Electorate of Cologne. A certificate from 1236 mentions Knight Ludolfus de Wittering who is most likely to have erected Wittringen Castle around that time. Especially during the first years of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48) many cornfields in and around Gladbeck were destroyed by marauding soldiers. Additionally, the Black Death killed many inhabitants of Gladbeck during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

At the 1815 Congress of Vienna the Kingdom of Prussia acquired the area and administered it within the Province of Westphalia. Before the Revolutions of 1848 there were three bad food crises in Gladbeck in 1816/17, 1830/31 and 1846/47. However, the &quot;March Revolution&quot; had no consequences on Gladbeck.

===Time of coal mining===

Coal was found in the 1870s and the first coal was produced in 1878. Depending on additional workers, the coal mines attracted many people. Therefore, Gladbeck rapidly grew by immigration from surrounding Westphalia, the Rhine Province, and from the eastern provinces of Prussia including citizens with Polish as their native language.

The little village quickly turned into an establishment of industry and was given town privilege in July 1919. Also Gladbeck benefited from the general boom in the years 1925 to 1929 when important building projects were realised in spite of all troubles, such as the open-air bath as well as the stadium, in which Adolf Hitler delivered a speech in 1932.

As with all German towns, Gladbeck was brought into line after Adolf Hitler was named Reichskanzler. This took place under the earlier elected conservative mayor Bernhard Hackenberg, immediately joining the Nazi Party. In World War II Gladbeck was heavily damaged and around 43% of the buildings in the center were destroyed, making it as one of the most destroyed towns in the Ruhr Area. After the war the town became part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

During the 1960s the coal industry went into a substantial crisis, resulting in widespread unemployment. Apart from this Gladbeck&#x27;s population reached 85,927 inhabitants in 1969, which is unique in the history of this town. Since the last coal mine was closed in 1971 Gladbeck is fighting against a high rate of unemployment, activating the structural change.

===Communal realignment and history since 1975===
In the course of the communal realignment in North Rhine-Westphalia (1975) Gladbeck, original a county borough, and the village Kirchhellen were incorporated into the neighbouring town Bottrop. Opponents of the realignment criticized the low population density at the border between Gladbeck and Bottrop and emphasized that Bottrop was not much bigger than Gladbeck. &quot;GlaBotKi is nich&quot; (Glabotki is not) was their catchphrase. With the help of a court decision Gladbeck successfully left Bottrop, thereby cancelling the merger. Since July 1976 Gladbeck is part of the district of Recklinghausen.

On 16 August 1988, the town received international attention when two thieves robbed a branch of the Deutsche Bank in Gladbeck. They kidnapped two bank employees and held them hostage, along with 32 people in a transport bus in Bremen and drove through West Germany and the Netherlands. In what was called the Gladbeck hostage crisis, the crisis ended in just over 2 days, with one police officer and two victims dead, and the arrest of the three individuals (Hans-Jürgen Rösner &amp; Dieter Degowski, along with Marion Löblich for her involvement in the crime as an accomplice).

==Politics==
The current mayor of Gladbeck is Bettina Weist of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) since 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, with a runoff held on 27 September, and the results were as follows:

===List of mayors===

Gladbeck possesses a mayor since it gained town privilege in July 1919. Yet, the official term was lord mayor as Gladbeck was a county borough by 1974. Since then it has a mayor and since 1994 the position as Gladbeck&#x27;s mayor is a full-time function.

The mayor is the chairman of the town council and employer of administration.
Gladbeck has had the following mayors:
*1919–1931: Michael Jovy, non party
*1931–?: Bernhard Hackenberg, joined the NSDAP in 1933
*1948–1952: Johann Harnischfeger, CDU
*1946–1958: Friedrich Lange, SPD
*1958–1963: Heinrich Kliem, SPD
*1963–1965: Hans Wuwer, SPD
*1965–1971: Günter Kalinowski, SPD
*1971–1974: Norbert Aust, SPD
*1976–1994: Wolfgang Röken, SPD
*1994–2004: Eckhard Schwerhoff, CDU
*2004–2020: Ulrich Roland, SPD
*since 2020: Bettina Weist, SPD

In 1994 Eckhard Schwerhoff was elected mayor by the town council after the SPD had governed Gladbeck for 48 years. The SPD failed the absolute majority only barely and because the mayor has one voice too it would have led to a stalemate.

As a result, the Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens and a new founded local party (BIG) made the decision to support Eckhard Schwerhoff, a CDU party member but not involved in the politics of Gladbeck until then. In 1999 Eckhard Schwerhoff was re-elected after a reform according to which mayors should be elected directly.

In the ballot on 10 October 2004 he no longer stood for the mayor and thereupon Ulrich Roland (SPD) was elected mayor.

===City council===
The Gladbeck city council governs the city alongside the Mayor. The most recent city council election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:

===Coat of arms===
Gladbeck&#x27;s city arms is portrayed in black, red and yellow and has a red bettlement as a sign of the received municipal law from 1919. The black field and the yellow hammer as well as the yellow beater on the left side represent the coal that had a major position in Gladbeck&#x27;s history. The black clasps on the right side are taken from the blazon of the Lords of Brabeck, having possessed the moated castle Wittringen at the end of the 14th century.

==Culture and sights==

===Museum===

The moated castle Wittringen houses the town&#x27;s museum. It contains collections and exhibitions on the history of Gladbeck. The museum shows the development of the region from the geological origins of its rich coal supplies to the first inhabitants and the present days. A major exhibit is a skeleton of a bison found in the district of Brauck. Other exhibits are:

* A coin collection and an offertory of Roman coins.
* A cemetery of the Bronze Age.
* Several rooms inform about the time of the coal mining.
* Moreover, the museum collects modern art, such as works by Joseph Beuys.

===Religious communities===

According to information of the town council 30,906 of 77,436 inhabitants were Catholics and 22,121 inhabitants were Protestants in December 2006. There are 11 churches, 5 are Protestant and 6 are Catholic.

In school pupils are allowed to choose between Catholic and Protestant lessons. Alternatively, pupils can be taught in Philosophy likewise if they want to. Visits to churches are included to the lessons in basic school. However, there is a Muslim minority in Gladbeck due to the immigration of the 1960s.

Several events, for example jazz festivals, take place regularly. There is also one library in Gladbeck and theater courses are normally offered in the three grammar schools.

<doc id="432715" wikidata="Q356395" url="?curid=432715" title="J. B. M. Hertzog">
<text>General James Barry Munnik Hertzog (3 April 1866 – 21 November 1942), better known as Barry Hertzog or J. B. M. Hertzog, was a South African politician and soldier. He was a Boer general during the Second Boer War who served as the third prime minister of the Union of South Africa from 1924 to 1939. Hertzog advocated for the development of Afrikaner culture and was determined to prevent Afrikaners from being excessively influenced by British culture. He founded the National Party in 1914.

In 1941, Hertzog, who had resigned after South Africa, against his efforts, entered World War II on the side of the Allies, issued a statement in which he openly praised Nazism and said it needed to be adapted to South African needs under a fascist dictatorship.

==Early life and career==
Hertzog first studied law at Victoria College in Stellenbosch, Cape Colony. In 1889, he went to the Netherlands to read law at the University of Amsterdam, where he prepared a dissertation, on the strength of which he received his doctorate in law on 12 November 1892.

Hertzog had a law practice in Pretoria from 1892 until 1895, when he was appointed to the Orange Free State High Court. During the Boer War of 1899–1902, he rose to the rank of general, becoming the assistant chief commandant of the military forces (Commando units) of the Orange Free State. Despite some military reverses, he gained renown as a resourceful leader of the Boer commandos who chose to continue fighting, the so-called &quot;bitter-enders&quot;. Eventually, convinced of the futility of further bloodshed, he signed the Treaty of Vereeniging in May 1902.

==Early political career==

With South Africa then at peace, Hertzog entered politics as the chief organiser of the Orangia Unie Party. In 1907, the Orange River Colony gained self-government and Hertzog joined the cabinet as Attorney-General and Director of Education. His insistence that Dutch as well as English be taught in the schools aroused bitter opposition. He was appointed national Minister of Justice in the newly formed Union of South Africa, and continued in office until 1912. His marked antagonism to the British authorities and Premier Botha led to a ministerial crisis. In 1913, Hertzog led the secession of the Old Boer and anti-British section from the South African Party.

At the outbreak of the Maritz Rebellion in 1914, Hertzog adopted a neutral stance towards the conflict. In the years following the war, he headed the opposition to the government of General Smuts.

==Premiership==

===First government (1924–1929)===
In the general election of 1924, Hertzog&#x27;s National Party defeated the South African Party of Jan Smuts and formed a coalition government with the South African Labour Party, which became known as the Pact Government. In 1934, the National Party and the South African Party merged to form the United Party, with Hertzog as Prime Minister and leader of the new party.

As prime minister, Hertzog presided over the passage of a wide range of social and economic measures that did much to improve conditions for working-class whites. According to one historian, &quot;the government of 1924, which combined Hertzog’s NP with the Labour Party, oversaw the foundations of an Afrikaner welfare state&quot;.

A Department of Labour was established, while the Wages Act (1925) laid down minimum wages for unskilled workers, although it excluded farm labourers, domestic servants, and public servants. It also established a Wage Board that regulated pay for certain kinds of work, regardless of racial background (although whites were the main beneficiaries of the legislation). The Old Age Pensions Act (1927) provided retirement benefits for white workers. Coloureds also received the pension, but the maximum for Coloureds was only 70% that of whites.

===Second government (1929–1933)===


The establishment of the South African Iron and Steel Industrial Corp in 1930 helped to stimulate economic progress, while the withdrawal of duties on imported raw materials for industrial use encouraged industrial development and created further employment opportunities, but that led to a higher cost of living. Various forms of assistance to agriculture were also introduced. Dairy farmers, for instance, were aided by a levy imposed on all butter sales, while an increase in import taxes protected farmers from international competition. Farmers also benefited from preferential railway tariffs and from the widening availability of loans from the Land Bank. The government also assisted farmers by guaranteeing prices for farm produce, while work colonies were established for those in need of social salvage. Secondary industries were established to improve employment opportunities, which did much to reduce white poverty and enabled many whites to join the ranks of both the semi-skilled and skilled labour force.

An extension of worker&#x27;s compensation was carried out, while improvements were made in the standards specified under a contemporary Factory Act, thus bringing the Act into line with international standards, in regard to the length of the working week and the employment of child labour. The law on miners&#x27; phthisis (pulmonary tuberculosis) was overhauled, and increased protection of white urban tenants against eviction was introduced at a time when housing was in short supply. The civil service was opened up to Afrikaners through the promotion of bilingualism, while a widening of the suffrage was effected, with the enfranchisement of white women. The pact also instituted &quot;penny postage&quot;, automatic telephone exchanges, a cash-on-delivery postal service, and an experimental airmail service which was later made permanent.

The Department of Social Welfare was established in 1937 as a separate government department to deal with social conditions. There was increased expenditure on education for both whites and Coloureds. Spending on Coloured education rose by 60%, which led to the number of Coloured children in school growing by 30%. Grants for the blind and the disabled were introduced in 1936 and 1937 respectively, while unemployment benefits were introduced in 1937. That same year, the coverage of maintenance grants was extended.

Although the social and economic policies pursued by Hertzog and his ministers did much to improve social and economic conditions for whites, they did not benefit the majority of South Africans, who found themselves the targets of discriminatory labour laws that entrenched white supremacy in South Africa. A Civilised Labour Policy was pursued by the Pact Government, which involved replacing black workers with whites (typically impoverished Afrikaners), and which was enforced through three key pieces of legislation: the Industrial Conciliation Act No 11 of 1924, the Minimum Wages Act No. 27 of 1925, and the Mines and Works Amendment Act no. 25 of 1926.

The Industrial Conciliation Act (No 11 of 1924) created job reservation for whites while excluding blacks from membership of registered trade unions, which therefore prohibited the registration of black trade unions. The Minimum Wages Act (No. 27 of 1925) bestowed upon the Minister for Labour the power to force employers to give preference to whites when hiring workers, while the Mines and Works Amendment Act (No. 25 of 1926) reinforced a colour bar in the mining industry, while excluding Indian miners from skilled jobs. In a sense, therefore, the discriminatory social and economic policies pursued by the Pact Government helped pave the way for the eventual establishment of the Apartheid state.

Constitutionally, Hertzog was a republican, believing strongly in promoting the independence of the Union of South Africa from the British Empire. His government approved the Statute of Westminster in 1931, and replaced Dutch as the second official language with Afrikaans in 1925, as well as instating a new national flag in 1928. His government approved women&#x27;s suffrage for white women in 1930, thus strengthening the dominance of the white minority. Property and education requirements for whites were abandoned in the same year, with those for non-whites being severely tightened, and, in 1936, blacks were completely taken off the common voters&#x27; roll. Separately elected &quot;Native Representatives&quot; were instead instated, a policy repeated in the attempts of the later Apartheid regime to disenfranchise all non-whites during the 1950s. Through the system of gradual disenfranchisement spanning half a century, the South African electorate was not made up entirely of whites until the 1970 general election.

===Third government (1933–1938)===


In foreign policy, Hertzog favoured a policy of distance from the British Empire and, as a lifelong Germanophile, was sympathetic towards revising the international system set up by the Treaty of Versailles in favour of lessening the burdens imposed on Germany. Hertzog&#x27;s cabinet in the 1930s was divided between a pro-British group led by the Anglophile Smuts, and a pro-German group led by Oswald Pirow, the openly pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic minister of defence, with Hertzog occupying a middle position. Hertzog had an autocratic style of leadership, expecting the cabinet to approve his decisions rather than to discuss them and, as a consequence, the cabinet only met intermittently.

From 1934 onward, South Africa was dominated by an informal &quot;inner cabinet&quot; consisting of Hertzog, Smuts, Pirow, the Finance minister N.C. Havenga, and Native Affairs minister P. G. W. Grobler. Generally, the &quot;inner cabinet&quot; would meet in private and whatever decision they reached in their meetings would be presented to the cabinet to endorse with no discussion. Though Hertzog was not as pro-German as the faction led by Pirow, he tended to see Nazi Germany as a &quot;normal state&quot; and as a potential ally, unlike the Soviet Union, which Hertzog saw as a threat to the West.

Alongside that, Hertzog saw France as the main threat to peace in Europe, viewing the Treaty of Versailles as an unjust and vindictive peace treaty, and he argued the French were the principal trouble-makers in Europe by seeking to uphold the Versailles Treaty. Hertzog argued that, if Adolf Hitler had a belligerent foreign policy, it was only because the Treaty of Versailles was intolerably harsh towards Germany, and, if the international system was revised to take account of Germany&#x27;s &quot;legitimate&quot; complaints against Versailles, then Hitler would become a moderate and reasonable statesman. When Germany remilitarized the Rhineland in March 1936, Hertzog informed the British government that there was no possibility of South Africa taking part if Britain decided to go to war over the issue, and, in the ensuing crisis, South African diplomats took a very pro-German position, arguing that Germany was justified in violating the Treaty of Versailles by remilitarizing the Rhineland.

Hertzog&#x27;s principal adviser on foreign affairs was his external affairs state secretary, H.D.J. Bodenstein, an anti-British Afrikaner nationalist and a republican, who was seen as the &quot;eminence grise&quot; of South African politics. No other man had the same degree of influence on Hertzog as Bodenstein. Sir William Henry Clark, the British High Commissioner to South Africa, had a long-standing feud with Bodenstein, whom he accused of being an Anglophobe, writing in his reports to London that Bodenstein always presented the British position in the worst possible light to Hertzog, and noting with anxiety that Bodenstein&#x27;s best friend was Emile Wiehle, the German consul in Cape Town. The Germanophile South African minister in Berlin, Stefanus Gie, largely embraced Nazi values as his own, and, in reports to Pretoria, portrayed Germany as the victim of Jewish plots, arguing that the Nazis&#x27; discriminatory policies towards German Jews were only defensive measures. Though Hertzog did not share the anti-Semitism of Gie, the latter&#x27;s dispatches portraying the Third Reich in a favourable light were used to support the prime minister&#x27;s foreign policy preferences.

In a statement of foreign policy principles for South Africa drawn up by Pirow for the cabinet in March 1938, the first principle was combating Communism, and the second was having Germany serve as the &quot;bulwark against Bolshevism&quot;. In a message to Charles te Water, the South African High Commissioner in London in early 1938, Hertzog told him to tell the British that South Africa expected &quot;immediacy, impartiality and sincerity&quot; in resolving the disputes of Europe. Just what was meant by that was explained by Hertzog in a letter to the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in March 1938, which stated that South Africa would not fight in any &quot;unjust&quot; wars, and that, if Britain choose to go to war over the events in Czechoslovakia, then South Africa would remain neutral. On 22 March 1938, Hertzog sent Te Water a telegram stating that South Africa would not under any circumstances go to war with Germany in defence of Czechoslovakia, and stating that he regarded Eastern Europe as being rightfully in Germany&#x27;s sphere of influence.

===Fourth government (1938–1939)===
In another letter in the spring of 1938, Hertzog noted that he was &quot;exhausted&quot; by France and wanted Chamberlain to tell the French that the Commonwealth, and South Africa in particular, would be neutral if France went to war with Germany over a German attack on Czechoslovakia. When te Water reported to Hertzog on 25 May 1938 that the British foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, had promised him that the British government was applying diplomatic pressure on Czechoslovakia to resolve the dispute over the Sudetenland in Germany&#x27;s favour, and was pressuring France to abandon its alliance with Czechoslovakia, Hertzog stated his approval. On 14 September 1938, te Water complained to Lord Halifax about the &quot;astonishing episode&quot; of Britain drifting to war with Germany over the Sudetenland issue, stating that as far as South Africa was concerned, Germany was in the right in demanding that mostly German-speaking Sudetenland be allowed to join Germany, and Czechoslovakia and France was in the wrong, the first by refusing the German demands, and the second by having an alliance with Czechoslovakia that encouraged Prague to resist Berlin.

In the middle of September 1938, when Britain was on the verge of war with Germany over the Sudetenland issue, Hertzog clashed in the cabinet with Smuts over the course of action that South Africa would pursue. The former favoured neutrality and the latter was for intervention on Britain&#x27;s side. On 15 September 1938, Hertzog presented the cabinet with a compromise plan that South Africa would declare neutrality in the event of war, but would be neutral in the most pro-British way possible. The cabinet was divided. Pirow favoured South Africa allying itself with Germany to fight against Britain. On the other hand, Smuts favoured South Africa allying with Britain and going to war with Germany, and threatened to use his influence with the MPs loyal to himself to bring down the government if Hertzog did declare neutrality.

On 19 September 1938, as a part of a peace plan to resolve the crisis, Britain offered to guarantee Czechoslovakian territorial sovereignty if the latter agreed to allow the Sudetenland to join Germany, which led te Water to inform Lord Halifax that South Africa was utterly opposed to being part of the guarantee, and advised Britain against promising one, through he later changed his position, saying that South Africa would &quot;guarantee&quot; Czechoslovakia if it was backed by the League of Nations, and if Germany signed a non-aggression pact with Czechoslovakia.

On 23 September 1938, at the Bad Godesberg summit, Hitler rejected the Anglo-French plan for transferring the Sudetenland to Germany as insufficient, thus putting Europe on the brink of war. In a telegram to Chamberlain on 26 September 1938, Hertzog wrote that the differences between the Anglo-French and German positions were &quot;mainly of method&quot; and that, &quot;as the issue was one of no material substance, but merely involves a matter of procedure for arriving at a result to which it is common cause between disputants Germany is entitled&quot;, there was no possibility of South Africa going to war over the issue. Even after Hitler&#x27;s belligerent speech on Berlin on the same day, proclaiming that he would still attack Czechoslovakia unless Prague settled its disputes with Poland and Hungary by 1 October 1938, Hertzog, in a telegram to te Water, wrote that he felt &quot;very deeply that if after this a European war was still to take place the responsibility for that will not be placed upon the shoulders of Germany&quot;.

In his messages to te Water in the last days of September 1938, Hertzog consistently portrayed Czechoslovakia and France as the trouble-makers, and argued that Britain must do more to apply pressure on those two states for more concessions to Germany. Te Water and the Canadian high commissioner in London, Vincent Massey, in a joint note on behalf of South Africa and Canada to Lord Halifax, stated that Sir Basil Newton, the British minister in Prague, should tell the Czechoslovak president Edvard Beneš, that &quot;the obstructive tactics of the Czech government were unwelcome to the British and Dominion governments&quot;. On 28 September 1938, Hertzog was able to get the cabinet to approve his policy of pro-British neutrality subject to parliamentary approval, adding that South Africa would only go to war if Germany attacked Britain first. Given his views, Hertzog very much approved of the Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938, which he regarded as a &quot;just&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; resolution of the German-Czechoslovak dispute.

On 4 September 1939, the United Party caucus revolted against Hertzog&#x27;s stance of neutrality in World War II, causing Hertzog&#x27;s government to lose a vote on the issue in parliament by 80 to 67. Governor-General Sir Patrick Duncan refused Hertzog&#x27;s request to dissolve parliament and call a general election on the question. Hertzog resigned and his coalition partner Smuts became prime minister. Smuts led the country into war, and political re-alignments followed: Hertzog and his faction joined with Daniel Malan&#x27;s opposition Purified National Party to form the Herenigde Nasionale Party, with Hertzog becoming the new Leader of the Opposition. However, Hertzog soon lost the support of Malan and his supporters when they rejected Hertzog&#x27;s platform of equal rights between British South Africans and Afrikaners, prompting Hertzog to resign and retire from politics.

Angered at being outmaneuvered, Hertzog issued a press statement in October 1941 in which he attacked &quot;liberal capitalism&quot; and the party system, while praising Nazism as in keeping with the traditions of the Afrikaners. He said Nazism was a system which simply had to be adapted to South African needs under a dictator.

==Death and legacy==
Hertzog died on 21 November 1942, at the age of 76.

A 4-metre-high statue of Hertzog was erected in 1977 at the front lawns of the Union Building. The statue was taken down on 22 November 2013 and moved to a new location in the gardens. It was still in good condition, save for the removal of the spectacles that were originally included on the statue. The statue was removed to make way for a 9-metre-high statue of Nelson Mandela.

Supporters of Hertzog invented the Hertzoggie, a jam-filled tartlet with a coconut meringue topping, that is still a popular confection in South Africa.

He is the only South African Prime Minister to have served under three monarchs: George V, Edward VIII, and George VI, due to serving the year of 1936.

<doc id="432717" wikidata="Q1342591" url="?curid=432717" title="United States Army Special Operations Command">
<text>The United States Army Special Operations Command (Airborne) (USASOC ( )) is the command charged with overseeing the various special operations forces of the United States Army. Headquartered at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, it is the largest component of the United States Special Operations Command. It is an Army Service Component Command. Its mission is to organize, train, educate, man, equip, fund, administer, mobilize, deploy and sustain Army special operations forces to successfully conduct worldwide special operations.

== Subordinate units ==
=== 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) ===
The 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) is a division-level special operation forces command within the US Army Special Operations Command. The command was established on 30 September 2014, grouping together the Army special forces, psychological operations, civil affairs, and other support troops into a single organization operating out of its new headquarters building at Fort Bragg, NC.

==== Special Forces Groups ====
Established in 1952, the Special Forces Groups, also known as the Green Berets, was established as a special operations force of the United States Army designed to deploy and execute nine doctrinal missions: unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, direct action, counter-insurgency, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, information operations, counterproliferation of weapon of mass destruction, and security force assistance. These missions make special forces unique in the U.S. military because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict, and war. Often SF units are required to perform additional, or collateral, activities outside their primary missions. These collateral activities are coalition warfare/support, combat search and rescue, security assistance, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian de-mining, and counter-drug operations. Their unconventional warfare capabilities provide a viable military option for a variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or infeasible for conventional forces, making it the U.S. military&#x27;s premier unconventional warfare force.

Today, there are seven special forces groups, each one is primarily responsible for operations within a specific area of responsibility:
* 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne), (USINDOPACOM)
* 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne), (AFRICOM)
* 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), (CENTCOM)
* 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne), (USSOUTHCOM)
* 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), (EUCOM)
* 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) (ARNG), (USINDOPACOM) and (CENTCOM)
* 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) (ARNG), (USSOUTHCOM)

==== Psychological Operations Groups ====

The mission of the 4th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne) and 8th Psychological Operations Group (Airborne), a.k.a. PSYOP units, are to provide fully capable strategic influence forces to Combatant Commanders, U.S. Ambassadors, and other agencies to synchronize plans and execute inform and influence activities across the range of military operations via geographically focused PSYOP battalions.

 4th PSYOP Group (A) consists of five battalions:
* 1st PSYOP Battalion (USSOUTHCOM)
* 5th PSYOP Battalion (USINDOPACOM)
* 6th PSYOP Battalion (USEUCOM)
* 7th PSYOP Battalion (USAFRICOM)
* 8th PSYOP Battalion (USCENTCOM)

 The 8th PSYOP Group (A) consists of two battalions:
* 3rd PSYOP Battalion (Dissemination)
* 9th PSYOP Battalion (Tactical).

Psychological operations are a part of the broad range of U.S. political, military, economic and ideological activities used by the U.S. government to secure national objectives. Used during peacetime, contingencies, and declared war, these activities are not forms of force but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments. Persuading rather than compelling physically, they rely on logic, fear, desire, or other mental factors to promote specific emotions, attitudes or behaviors.

The ultimate objective of U.S. PSYOP is to convince enemy, neutral, and friendly nations and forces to take action favorable to the United States and its allies. The ranks of the PSYOP include regional experts and linguists who understand political, cultural, ethnic, and religious subtleties and use persuasion to influence perceptions and encourage desired behavior. With functional experts in all aspects of tactical communications, PSYOP offers joint force commanders unmatched abilities to influence target audiences as well as strategic influence capabilities to U.S. diplomacy.

In addition to supporting commanders, PSYOP units provide interagency strategic influence capabilities to other U.S. government agencies. In operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to drug interdiction, PSYOP enhances the impact of those agencies&#x27; actions. Their activities can be used to spread information about ongoing programs and to gain support from the local populace.

====95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Special Operations) (Airborne)====

The 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Special Operations) (Airborne) enables military commanders and U.S. Ambassadors to improve relationships with various stakeholders in a local area to meet the objectives of the U.S. government. 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) teams work with U.S. Department of State country teams, government and nongovernmental organizations at all levels and with local populations in peaceful, contingency and hostile environments. 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) units can rapidly deploy to remote areas with small villages and larger population centers around the world.

They help host nations assess the needs of an area, bring together local and non-local resources to ensure long-term stability, and ultimately degrade and defeat violent extremist organizations and their ideologies. They may be involved in disaster prevention, management, and recovery, and with human and civil infrastructure assistance programs.

The 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) conducts its mission via five geographically focused operational battalions:
* 91st Civil Affairs Battalion (USAFRICOM)
* 92nd Civil Affairs Battalion (EUCOM)
* 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (USCENTCOM)
* 97th Civil Affairs Battalion (USINDOPACOM)
* 98th Civil Affairs Battalion (USSOUTHCOM)

The soldiers in these units are adept at working in foreign environments and conversing in one of about 20 foreign languages with local stakeholders. Brigade teams may work for months or years in remote areas of a host nation. Their low profile and command structure allow them to solidify key relationships and processes, to address root causes of instability that adversely affect the strategic interests of the United States.

====528th Sustainment Brigade (Special Operations) (Airborne)====

The 528th Sustainment Brigade (SO) (A) is responsible for providing logistical, medical, signal, and intelligence support for Army special operations forces worldwide in support of contingency missions and war fighting commanders. Headquartered at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the 528th Sustainment Brigade (SO) (A) sets the operational level logistics conditions to enable Army Special Operation Forces (ARSOF) using multiple Support Operations teams and three battalions.

The Support Operations teams embed each regional theaters&#x27; staff to support planning and coordination with theater Army, U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Army Special Operations Command to ensure support during operations and training. Support Operations consists of four detachments: current operations, which manages five geographically aligned ARSOF Liaison Elements (ALEs), a future operations detachment, a commodity managers detachment, and an ARSOF support operations element.

The 528th Support Battalion provides rapidly deployable combat service support and health service support to ARSOF and consists of a headquarters company with an organic rigger detachment, a special operations medical detachment with four Austere Resuscitative Surgical Teams (ARSTs), the 197th Special Troops Support Company from the Texas Army National Guard, and 1/528th Forward Support Company from the West Virginia Army National Guard.

The 112th Special Operations Signal Battalion specializes in communication, employing innovative telecommunications technologies to provide Special Operations Joint Task Force (SOJTF) commanders with secure and nonsecure voice, data and video services. The 112th&#x27;s signals expertise allows ARSOF to &quot;shoot, move and communicate&quot; on a continuous basis. Soldiers assigned to 112th are taught to operate and maintain a vast array of unique equipment not normally used by their conventional counterparts. To meet the needs of ARSOF, the 112th deploys communications packages that are rapidly deployable on a moment&#x27;s notice. Soldiers assigned to 112th are airborne qualified.

The 389th Military Intelligence Battalion was established in March 2015 and conducts command and control of multi-disciplined intelligence operations in support of the 1st Special Forces Command (A) G2, component subordinate units, and mission partners via three companies: a headquarters company; an Analytical Support Company with a cytological support element and five geographically aligned regional support teams; a Mission Support Company with a Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) detachment, a HUMINT and GEOINT detachment, and conducts the Special Warfare SIGINT Course; and an additional PED detachment at Fort Eisenhower. On order, it deploys and conducts intelligence operations as part of a Special Operations Joint Task Force (SOJTF).

===U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command (Airborne)===
The U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command (USASOAC), activated on 25 March 2011, organizes, mans, trains, resources and equips Army special operations aviation units to provide responsive, special operations aviation support to Special Operations Forces (SOF) and is the USASOC aviation staff proponent. Today, USASOAC consists of five distinct units: the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), the USASOC Flight Company (UFC), the Special Operations Training Battalion (SOATB), the Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO), and the Systems Integration Management Office (SIMO).

The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), newly subordinate to ARSOAC, provides aviation support to special operations forces. Known as &quot;Night Stalkers,&quot; these soldiers are recognized for their proficiency in nighttime operations striking undetected during the hours of darkness and are recognized as the pioneers of the US Army&#x27;s nighttime flying techniques. Today, Night Stalkers continue developing and employing new technology and tactics, techniques and procedures for the battlefield. They employ highly modified heavy assault versions of the MH-47 Chinook, medium assault and attack versions of the MH-60 Black Hawk, light assault and attack versions of the MH-6 Little Bird helicopters, and MQ-1C Gray Eagles via four battalions, two Extended-Range Multi-Purpose (ERMP) companies, a headquarters company, and a training company. The 1st Battalion, 2nd Battalion, the regiment, and its ERMP companies are stationed at Fort Campbell, 3rd Battalion is at Hunter Army Airfield, and 4th Battalion is at Joint Base Lewis–McChord.

===75th Ranger Regiment===
The 75th Ranger Regiment, also known as the Rangers, is an airborne light-infantry special operations unit. The regiment is headquartered at Fort Moore, Georgia and is composed of a regimental airborne special troops battalion, a regimental airborne military intelligence battalion, and three airborne light-infantry battalions. The 1st Ranger Battalion is stationed at Hunter Army Airfield, 2nd Ranger Battalion at Joint Base Lewis–McChord, and 3rd Ranger Battalion is at Fort Moore (formerly Fort Benning) along with the special troops battalion, the military intelligence battalion, and regimental headquarters.

Within the US special operations community, the 75th Ranger Regiment is unique with its ability to attack heavily defended targets of interest. The regiment specializes in air assault, direct action raids, seizure of key terrain (such as airfields), destroying strategic facilities, and capturing or killing high-profile individuals. Each battalion of the regiment can deploy anywhere in the world within 18 hours&#x27; notice. Rangers can conduct squad through regimental-size operations using a variety of insertion techniques including airborne, air assault, and ground infiltration. The regiment is an all-volunteer force with an intensive screening and selection process followed by combat-focused training. Rangers are resourced to maintain exceptional proficiency, experience and readiness.

===U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School===
The U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (SWCS) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, is one of the Army&#x27;s premier education institutions, managing and resourcing professional growth for soldiers in the Army&#x27;s three distinct special-operations branches: Special Forces, Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations. The soldiers educated through SWCS programs are using cultural expertise and unconventional techniques to serve their country in far-flung areas across the globe. More than anything, these soldiers bring integrity, adaptability and regional expertise to their assignments.

On any given day, approximately 3,100 students are enrolled in SWCS training programs. Courses range from entry-level training to advanced warfighter skills for seasoned officers and NCOs. The 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne) qualifies soldiers to enter the special operations community. The 2nd Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne) focuses on teaches special operators advanced tactical skills as they progress through their careers. The Joint Special Operations Medical Training Center, operating under the auspices of the Special Warfare Medical Group, is the central training facility for the Department of Defense special operations combat medics. Furthermore, SWCS leads efforts to professionalize the Army&#x27;s entire special operations force through the Special Forces Warrant Officer Institute and the David K. Thuma Noncommissioned Officer Academy. While most courses are conducted at Fort Bragg, SWCS enhances its training by maintaining facilities and relationships with outside institutions across the country.

===1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta===
The 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D), commonly referred to as Delta Force, Combat Applications Group (CAG), &quot;The Unit&quot;, Army Compartmented Element, or within the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) as Task Force Green, is an elite special mission unit of the United States Army, under the organization of USASOC, but controlled by JSOC. It is used for hostage rescue and counterterrorism, as well as direct action and reconnaissance against high-value targets. 1st SFOD-D and its U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force counterparts, DEVGRU, &quot;SEAL Team 6&quot;, and the 24th Special Tactics Squadron, perform the most highly complex and dangerous missions in the U.S. military. These units are also often referred to as &quot;Tier One&quot; and &quot;special mission units&quot; by the U.S. government.

<doc id="432719" wikidata="Q2620282" url="?curid=432719" title="Anticrepuscular rays">
<text>Anticrepuscular rays, or antisolar rays, are meteorological optical phenomena similar to crepuscular rays, but appear opposite the Sun in the sky. Anticrepuscular rays are essentially parallel, but appear to converge toward the antisolar point, the vanishing point, due to a visual illusion from linear perspective.

Anticrepuscular rays are most frequently visible around dawn or dusk. This is because the atmospheric light scattering that makes them visible (backscattering) is larger for low angles to the horizon than most other angles. Anticrepuscular rays are dimmer than crepuscular rays because backscattering is less than forward scattering. 

Anticrepuscular rays can be continuous with crepuscular rays, curving across the whole sky in great circles.

==Mountain shadow==

A common example of a single anticrepuscular ray is provided by the shadow of a mountain at sunset, when viewed from the summit. It appears to be triangular, whatever the shape of the mountain, with the apex at the antisolar point.

==Wagon-wheel spokes==
Anticrepuscular rays are sometimes seen enclosed by a rainbow. In this case they can be called &quot;wagon-wheel spokes&quot;.

<doc id="432721" wikidata="Q178385" url="?curid=432721" title="Sliven">
<text>Sliven ( ) is the eighth-largest city in Bulgaria and the administrative and industrial centre of Sliven Province and municipality in Northern Thrace. It is situated in the Sliven Valley at the foothills of the Balkan Mountains.

Sliven is famous for its heroic Haiduts who fought against the Ottoman Turks in the 19th century and is known as the &quot;City of the 100 Voyvodi&quot;, a Voyvoda being a leader of Haiduts.

The famous rocky massif Sinite Kamani (Сините камъни, &quot;The Blue Rocks&quot;) and the associated Sinite Kamani Nature Park, the fresh air and the mineral springs at Slivenski Mineralni Bani offer diverse opportunities for leisure and tourism. Investors are exploring the opportunity to use the local wind (Bora) for the production of electricity.

Another point of interest and a major symbol of the city as featured on the coat of arms, is the more than thousand-year-old Stariyat Briast (Старият Бряст, &quot;The Old Elm&quot;), a huge Smooth-leaved Elm in the center of the city. During Ottoman rule, Turkish officials used to hang Bulgarian revolutionaries on it. Today the city is helping the tree to live on by frequent evaluations and reinforcing its base. It was elected Bulgarian tree of the year in 2013. On 19 March 2014 the results of an online poll were revealed at a ceremony in the European Parliament. The Old Elm was voted European Tree of the Year 2014. The city also served as an important strategic centre for the Bulgarian Army, with the headquarters of the Bulgarian Third Army located in the centre of the city, being situated relatively near to the sensitive Turkish border.

Sliven Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Sliven.

== Etymology ==
The name comes from the Slavic word &quot;sliv&quot; (&quot;pour, confluence&quot;) + the Slavic suffix or ending &quot;-en&quot;. In Turkish the name of the city is İslimiye, while in Greek it is Σλίβεν.

== Geography ==

Sliven is situated in the Sliven Valley at the foothills of the Balkan Mountains. It is located 300 km east of Bulgaria&#x27;s capital Sofia, 100 km from Burgas, the country&#x27;s largest commercial port, 130 km from the border with Turkey and 130 km from the border with Greece. It is located in close proximity to the cities of Yambol and Nova Zagora.

West of the city lies the so-called Peach Valley which contains large peach orchards. The city is also known for the mineral baths at Slivenski Mineralni Bani some 12 km southeast, whose water is used to treat diseases of the liver and nervous system.

The most visited geographical location and attraction in the city is the Karandila (Карандила). It is a hilltop 1050m above sea level, with great sights overlooking the city. The rock formation Halkata (Хaлката, &quot;The Ring&quot;) is located on the Karandila. It is a rock protrusion with a peculiar hole in the center. According to myth, one would have their most sincere wish granted upon passing through the ring. Karandila is the site of the annual Karakachani festival, organized by the Federation of the Cultural and Educational Associations of Karakachans (ФКПДК) in Bulgaria each July.

Karandila is located in Sinite Kamani Nature Park, whose peak Bulgarka (1181 m) is the highest in the eastern Balkan Mountains.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
Remains of the oldest settlements on the territory of Sliven date back to around 6000 BCE of the Neolithic. Ruins of a Thracian settlement dating to around 5th–3rd century BCE as well as Thracian ceramics and Hellenistic coins have been discovered in the area of Hisarlaka — a small hill in Sliven. In antiquity it was known as &quot;Selymnos (Σήλυμνος in Greek)&quot;. The area occupied by present-day Sliven has in the past been settled by the Thracian tribes Asti, Kabileti and Seleti. These tribes held their independence until time of Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great who conquered them.

The 2nd century BCE marked the beginning of the Roman conquests of northeastern Thracia. Sliven was conquered by Rome around 72–71 BCE when the Thracian Kabile and later Greek cities of Kabile and Apolonia are conquered. With the emergence of the Roman Empire the region of the city became part of the Thracian province of the Roman Empire.

A new stage in the city&#x27;s history began around 2nd-4th century. The first written records of the settlement&#x27;s name, Tuida/Suida/Tsuida date to this period. This name is most likely of Thracian origin. Its etymology is currently not understood. It is also mentioned by Hierocles, who identifies it as one of the four cities in the province of Haemimontus, established as part of the Diocese of Thrace under Diocletian and also by Procopius of Caesarea. The Roman road from Anchialos (today Pomorie) along the Tundzha to Serdika was built.

In a written record from the 3rd century, the settlement was called &quot;Tarzhishte&quot; and most likely belonged to the territory of the city of Augusta Traiana (today Stara Zagora).

The fortress avoided the Gothic War, but was destroyed in the Huns&#x27; raid in the 5th century. During the reign of Emperor Anastasius I Dicorus, it was rebuilt, which retained the previous one&#x27;s plan, but was considerably fortified.

In the ancient fortress&#x27; interior and near its eastern wall, are excavated the remains of a basilica with a baptistery, which functioned in the 5th-6th centuries. It was likely destroyed by the Huns and rebuilt under Justinian I. A larger church was founded in the south of the fortress, built in the 5th century and enlarged in the 6th century. This indicates that the settlement was not limited to the territory of the fortress, but also expanded in the surrounding area.

The city of Tuida/Tsuida was the seat of a bishop, subordinate to the Metropolitanate of Adrianople. Until that time the bishop seat was in Cabyle. In the 4th century, most likely due to the proximity of the two cities, which were in different provinces, Cabyle was abandoned and its population moved to Diospolis. The seat of the bishop, however, for unknown reasons, was moved to Tuida, which very likely marked the beginning of the proverbial rivalry between Sliven and Yambol.

Tuida ceased to exist around 598-599, when it was again destroyed, most likely by the Avars and Slavs. There is a theory that this happened as part of a major battle between the Avars and the Byzantine general Comentius.

=== Middle Ages ===
The area of Sliven was incorporated into the First Bulgarian Empire around 705 as part of the Slav-settled Zagore, according to Tervel&#x27;s treaty with the Byzantine Emperor Justinian II. A settlement was established on the area of Tuida, of which the etymology is unknown. The beginnings of the settlement weren&#x27;t dated, but were before 870, when a lead seal of Boris I was discovered. The Bulgarians reconstructed the walls of the fortress and also the water supply at the northern gate. New buildings were built, some of which, have lined marble slabs made in Preslav&#x27;s stonemasonry workshops.

Paleoornithologist Zlatozar Boev discovered bone remains of 14 species of wild and domestic birds in Hissarlaka from the 10th-12th centuries. The findings of Hawk eagle (Aquila fasciata) and grouse (Tetrao urogallus) are among the rarest in the country.

The town continued to exist after the dissolution of the first empire. The Pechenegs briefly controlled it in mid-10th century, after which it began to decline. In 1153, the town was rebuilt. The fortress was abandoned and ceased.

During the Second Bulgarian Empire, twenty-four monasteries were built in its vicinity, which formed a complex. Under Tsar Ivan Alexander, Sliven was a town near the Byzantine Empire. During the Ottoman invasion of Bulgaria, the medieval town was destroyed and the monasteries were burnt. The city was known as &quot;İslimye&quot; by the Turks.

=== Early modern history ===
During Ottoman rule Sliven was a sanjak centre in first Rumelia eyalet, then Silistre (Özi) eyalet, Edirne vilayet. From the beginning of the 16th century it was the centre of a kaza, which retained its territory until the middle of the 19th century. In the 17th century Sliven developed as a crafts centre and also famous for the production of guns, pickaxes, iron tools. The town was the settlement of a strong Hajduk movement against the Ottomans and became known as &quot;the town of the hundred voivodes&quot;. Among them were Hadzhi Dimitar, Zlati Voivoda and Panayot Hitov. As the chief priest of the Bulgarian Militia, Amphilohiy from Sliven consecrated the Samara flag in Ploiești. Sliven was also as a Jewish center. By 1859, 30 Jewish families lived in Sliven, where a synagogue and a Jewish school were built for them.

In 1738, the population of Sliven was predominantly Turkish. In a register from 1792, Sliven Sanjak is mentioned for the first time. Many Sliven residents participated in the Greek War of Independence. Hadzi Hristo was made a general and took the lead of the troops of Bulgarians, Albanians and Greeks, and was later elected to the Greek parliament. The inhabitants of the town also supported the Brăila revolt, Crimean War and participated in the Second Bulgarian Legion.

During the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829, the troops of General Hans Karl von Diebitsch entered Sliven. Continuous massacres of the Muslim population and desecration of mosques were made, involving both Bulgarian and Russian soldiers and local residents. The first Russian consulate was opened here in April 1830. After the withdrawal of the Russian troops, more than 15,000 people from the town and surrounding villages were displaced to southern Russia, Bessarabia and Wallachia, while only 2,000-3,000 Bulgarians remained in the town. With this, Sliven suffered a severe demographic and economic blow, which blunted the momentum of its former development.

During the Bulgarian National Revival, Sliven emerged as an important trade, craft and cultural centre. The town was divided into residential, commercial and craft and administrative parts. Through the efforts of Dobri Chintulov and other Sliven notables, the Zora Community Centre was founded in 1860. The founder of the Bulgarian theatrical work was the Sliven-born public and cultural worker Sava Dobroplodni, who wrote the first play in Bulgarian history - &quot;Mihal Mishkoed&quot;. In 1843, the first textile industrial enterprise in the Ottoman Empire was established in Sliven, with Dobri Zhelyazkov as its head. In 1864 a second one was opened, and in 1872 tobacco and spirit factories were established.

The inhabitants of Sliven became actively involved in the national church struggle. In 1859, the people of Sliven expelled the Greek bishop, and the Diocese of Sliven entered the borders of the Bulgarian Exarchate established on 28 February 1870. The first spiritual leader of the diocese was Metropolitan Seraphim of Sliven.

During the April Uprising, Sliven was the centre of the Second Revolutionary District. Battles were fought near the town during the Russo-Turkish Liberation War of 1877-1878 which in return burnt 800 shops and 100 houses in the town centre. Metropolitan Seraphim is particularly credited with saving Sliven and a number of settlements and chifliks in the region from complete destruction. Sliven was liberated by Russian troops on 16 January 1878.

In the 19th century, the town was a district centre and was one of the largest towns in Bulgaria with a population of over 20,000. The majority were Bulgarians. For a short period a centre of a department in the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia before its inclusion in the Principality of Bulgaria in 1885.

=== Modern history ===
At the municipal elections in September 1911, the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party won the most seats, but failed to take over the municipality until August 1912, when Dr. Yordan Danchev was elected mayor. The party won elections again in 1915 and 1919. A welfare bureau, a labor bureau, and municipal housing for the homeless were established. Binding regulations were issued on relations between workers and employers on wages, on weekends and holidays. The administration was dissolved on 31 January 1923 by a decision of the BZNS-dominated Sliven District Court. 

During the First World War it was the site of the Sliven prisoner of war camp, the largest such camp in the country. It was the place of internment for Greek and Serbian civilians and soldiers, with peak numbers of 19,000.

From the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Bulgaria in the late 19th century until the beginning of the socialist economy in 1945, the industry was concentrated in the northern parts of the city. The new Socialist government gradually began to consolidate the existing factories and built new ones, with industry concentrating around the newly built station. At some point the industrial workforce numbered 20,000, 1/2 of whom were in textile production - wool and cotton textiles. The second most important is the food industry and the third is the machine building industry (ZMM - Sliven, Dinamo Plant, etc.).

As one of the most significant cultural centres during the Bulgarian National Revival, with much of its old heritage still preserved and enriched, modern Sliven offers to its citizens and visitors a lot of opportunities for cultural life. It served as the birthplace of many prominent Bulgarians, including Hadzhi Dimitar, Dobri Chintulov, Ivan Seliminski. Another notable native is Anton Pann who composed the Romanian national anthem. Another notable resident is Yordan Letchkov, whose goal in the 1994 World Cup eliminated defending champion Germany. Letchkov was mayor of Sliven from 2003 to 2011.
== Politics ==
Mayors from Bulgarian Socialist Party have been in charge of Sliven Municipality in the period 1990–1991, 1999–2003 and 2011–2015. For his second term (2007–2011), Yordan Letchkov was nominated by GERB. Since 2015, Stefan Radev is the mayor of Sliven Municipality. In the local elections in 2011 and 2019, he was nominated by GERB (he won in 2019). Hristin Petkov was mayor of the SDS from 1991 to 1995.

In the 2011 local elections, the BSP candidate (and non-member of the party) General Kolyo Milev won in the second round with 52.94% of the votes counted against the GERB candidate (also non-member) Yordan Letchkov.

Since 2015, the mayor of Sliven has been Stefan Radev, nominated by PP GERB (2015 and 2019), re-elected with 64.75% in the second round of local elections in 2019. On 11 November 2019, he officially took office.

== Economy ==
The economy of Sliven has centered around industry since the early 19th century. In 1834, Dobri Zhelyazkov established the first factory in Bulgarian lands, thus starting industrial development in Bulgaria. Sliven was one of the largest industrial centers in Bulgaria, playing an important role during the Bulgarian National Revival. It has long-lived traditions in textiles, machine-building, glass-making, chemical production, and the technical and food industries.

Following the beginning of communist rule in Bulgaria in 1944, most industries were nationalized and much industrial building and development was spurred. Industry continued to develop until the fall of communism, at which point much of the previously built industry stagnated; many plants and factories were shut down and there was little development.

In contemporary times, Sliven has experienced a surge in economy with increased investment, banking establishments and new industries have begun to emerge. The dairy industry, which has long been present, continues to grow and thrive. The wine industry, with companies such as Vinprom and Vini Sliven and about a dozen others, continues to grow as grapes are easily grown due to the climate conditions. In terms of heavy industry, the city produces electric lights and electrical machines. The city has also become notorious as a source of young girls who are trafficked into the sex industry.

Light industry in Sliven is mostly devoted to textiles with many companies making wool clothing, socks, and food.

In 2024, it was reported that a gang based in Sliven had been receiving up to £200 million annually in fraudulent welfare payments from the British government.

== Transportation ==

The city has a trolleybus system which opened in 1986.

It is a remnant of the Great Bulgarian Forest, which stretched from the Rhodope Mountains to the Black Sea. About 20 such elms remain in the village of Samuilovo, 7 km from Sliven. All of them have been declared protected sites. The cavities are filled with reinforcing filler and have been left openings for natural ventilation to stop rotting processes or breedings of microorganisms. The tree was used by the Ottoman Turks to hang captured hajduk.

=== Fortress Tuida ===

Tuida was an early Byzantine and medieval fortress, the remains of which are located on the hill of Hisarlaka in the northeastern part of Sliven, which offers a unique view of the &quot;Sinite kamani&quot; and the city (the hill is located near the &quot;Novo Selo&quot; quarter). It is part of the old mountain fortification system, which played an extremely important role in the defence of the Roman Empire, and later of the early Byzantine Empire, as well as the medieval Bulgarian state. After some interruption, archaeological excavations of the fortress began again in 2004. The aim of the excavations is the final study and conservation of the architectural and archaeological monuments, and the exposure of the fortress with a view to making it one of the city&#x27;s notable tourist attractions.

<doc id="432724" wikidata="Q748254" url="?curid=432724" title="Jet force">
<text>Jet force is the exhaust from some machine, especially aircraft, propelling the object itself in the opposite direction as per Newton&#x27;s third law. An understanding of jet force is intrinsic to the launching of drones, satellites, rockets, airplanes and other airborne machines.

Jet force begins with some propulsion system; in the case of a rocket, this is usually some system that kicks out combustible gases from the bottom. This repulsion system pushes out these gas molecules in the direction opposite the intended motion so rapidly that the opposite force, acting 180° away from the direction the gas molecules are moving, (as such, in the intended direction of movement) pushes the rocket up. A common wrong assumption is that the rocket elevates by pushing off the ground. If this were the case, the rocket would be unable to continue moving upwards after the aircraft is no longer close to the ground. Rather, the opposite force by the expelled gases is the reason for movement.
== Thrust, lift, weight and drag ==
The jet force can be divided into components. The &quot;forward&quot; component of this force is generally referred to as thrust. The upward component of jet force is referred to as lift. There are also two other forces that impact motion of aircraft. Drag, which is also referred to as air resistance, is the force that opposes motion. As such, it acts against both components of the jet force (both the thrust and the lift). The fourth and final force is the weight itself, which acts directly downward.

=== Thrust ===
To analyze thrust, we take a mathematical perspective.

# First, an aircraft takes off at some angle with respect to the ground. For a rocket traveling straight &quot;up&quot;, this angle would be 90°, or at least close to 90°. For airplanes and most other aircraft, this angle will be much less, generally ranging from 0° to 60°. We shall define this angle as θ.
# θ is constantly changing as the aircraft moves around. At any given moment, however, the cosine of this angle θ will give us the component of the force that is acting in the forward direction. Multiplying the total force by this cosine of θ would yield the thrust: formula_1

Because θ ranges from 0° to 90° and the cosine of any angle in this range is 0 ≤ cos θ≤ 1, the thrust will always be either less than or equal to the jet force- as expected, as the thrust is a component of the jet force.

=== Lift ===
Similar to our analysis of thrust, we begin with a mathematical look:

# We define angle θ the same way we did in step 1 for thrust. Again, this angle θ is different at any given time.
# For lift, however, we are looking for the vertical component, rather than the forward component. The sine of angle θ will give us the component of the force acting in vertical component. Multiplying the jet force by the sine of θ will yield the lift: formula_2

Similar to cosine, the sine of an angle ranging from 0° to 90° will always between at least zero and at most one. As such, the lift will also be less than the jet force. Of jet force, lift and thrust, we can find any one of these if the other two are given using the distance formula. In this case, that would be:
formula_3

As such, jet force, thrust and lift are inherently linked.

=== Drag ===
Drag, or air resistance, is a force that opposes motion. Since the thrust is a force that provides &quot;forward motion&quot; and, lift one that produces &quot;upward motion&quot;, the drag opposes both of these forces. Air resistance is friction between the air itself and the moving object (in this case the aircraft). The calculation of air resistance is far more complicated than that of thrust and lift- it has to do with the material of the aircraft, the speed of the aircraft and other variable factors. However, rockets and airplanes are built with materials and in shapes that minimize drag force, maximizing the force that moves the aircraft upward/forward.

=== Weight ===
Weight is the downward force that the lift must overcome to produce upward movement. On earth, weight is fairly easy to calculate:
formula_4

In this equation, m represents the mass of the object and g is the acceleration that is produced by gravity. On earth, this value is approximately 9.8 m/s squared. When the force for lift is greater than the force of weight, the aircraft accelerates upwards.

== Analysis with momentum ==
To calculate the speed of the vessel due to the jet force itself, analysis of momentum is necessary. Conservation of momentum states the following:
formula_5

In this situation, m1 represents the mass of the gas in the propulsion system, v1 represents the initial speed of this gas, m2 represents the mass of the rocket and v2 represents the initial velocity of the rocket. On the other end of the equation, v1f represents the final velocity of the gas and v2f represents the final velocity of the rocket. Initially, both the gas in the propulsion system and the rocket are stationary, leading to v1 and v2 equaling 0. As such, the equation can be simplified to the following:
formula_6

After some more simple algebra, we can calculate that v2 (the velocity of the rocket) is the following:
formula_7

This gives us the velocity of the aircraft right after it takes off. Because we know all forces acting on it from this point on, we can calculate net acceleration using Newton&#x27;s second law. Given the velocity that the aircraft takes off with and the acceleration at any point, the velocity can also be calculated at any given point.

<doc id="432733" wikidata="Q7437803" url="?curid=432733" title="Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region">
<text>The [[Scottish Junior Football Association]], East Region is one of two regions of the SJFA, which currently organises the Midlands League and local cup competitions.

The SJFA was previously split into six regions, but in 2002 the decision was taken to reform into three to try to ensure more games between the top clubs and hence increase their revenues; at that time the East Region was created by amalgamating the former East (Lothians), Fife and Tayside Regions. From 2017, the majority of the region&#x27;s ~60 member clubs left the SJFA to join the East of Scotland Football League within the Scottish football league system&#x27;s pyramid structure. in 2021, what remained of the East Region (17 Tayside clubs) was integrated into this &#x27;senior&#x27; pyramid as the Midlands League alongside the relatively unchanged SJFA North Region divisions, below the Highland Football League – the third SJFA region, West, had already disbanded a year earlier and formed its own divisions in the senior pyramid.

==League structure==
===Until 2006–07===
For season 2002–03, twelve clubs from the East (Lothians), Fife and Tayside leagues in the eastern part of Scotland combined to create the East Super League; this was fed by the existing regional leagues: Tayside Premier (with &quot;Tayside Division One&quot; below), Fife District League and Lothians Division One (with &quot;Lothians Division Two&quot; below.) A similar change occurred in the west of Scotland where the Ayrshire and Central leagues merged entirely to form a West Region. A year earlier, the North Region was renamed, but this had no impact on the system itself.

===2006–07 to 2012–13===
In 2006, a further reorganisation led to the creation of another region-wide tier below the East Super League, known as the East Premier League. Below this, the Regional leagues were streamlined into single North (Tayside), Central (Fife) and South (Lothians) Divisions. To balance the numbers in these new leagues, the majority of Perthshire clubs were re-allocated from the North to the Central Division (exceptions to this were Blairgowrie and Coupar Angus who remained in the North Division setup).

As of the end of 2006–07 season, clubs were promoted and relegated between the Super League and the Premier League. One club from each of the lowest-tier divisions would be promoted to the Premier League, with three Premier League sides relegated to a regional division corresponding to their geographical area.

===2013–14 to 2016–17===
As agreed at the 2011–12 East Region AGM, the leagues were restructured into four divisions from the 2013–14 season. The Super League and Premier League were expanded from twelve to sixteen clubs while the regional divisions were merged into two from the current three and branded as North and South; clubs in the Central division were split between the two new leagues on a geographical basis. The League Cup competitions which traditionally opened the season were also scrapped as part of these proposals.

=== 2017–18 to 2018–19 ===
In 2017, Kelty Hearts left the league to join the East of Scotland Football League in the senior pyramid. The following April, thirteen clubs—most of them from the East Juniors—moved to the East of Scotland League for the 2018–19 season. When the window for applications was extended, even more East Region clubs quit the Junior grade, bringing the total of clubs leaving Junior football that summer to 24:

* Arniston Rangers
* Blackburn United
* Bo&#x27;ness United
* Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic
* Broxburn Athletic
* Camelon Juniors

* Craigroyston
* Crossgates Primrose
* Dalkeith Thistle
* Dunbar United
* Dundonald Bluebell
* Easthouses Lily MW

* Edinburgh United
* Haddington Athletic
* Hill of Beath Hawthorn
* Jeanfield Swifts
* Linlithgow Rose
* Musselburgh Athletic

* Newtongrange Star
* Oakley United
* Penicuik Athletic
* Sauchie Juniors
* St Andrews United
* Tranent Juniors
The loss of clubs caused the league to restructure from four divisions to three, effectively removing the Premier League and rearranging the 36 clubs into a 12-team Super League with two 12-team North and South divisions below. Glenrothes and Kinnoull also made the move to the senior pyramid in summer 2019.

=== From 2019–20 ===
The entire region was split into north and south sections, each containing a 10-team Super League and a 8 or 10-team Premier League below. Four clubs joined the South Premier League: Bo&#x27;ness United Junior, Linlithgow Rose Community, Syngenta, and Sauchie Juniors Community.

In April 2020, the 2019–20 season was declared null and void due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the next month it was confirmed that a further eight clubs, mostly from Fife, were leaving the East Juniors for the East of Scotland League:
*Kennoway Star Hearts
*Kirkcaldy &amp; Dysart
*Lochgelly Albert
*Lochore Welfare

*Luncarty
*Newburgh
*Rosyth
*Thornton Hibs

For the 2020–21 season, the remaining 30 clubs were merged into a single tier split into a Tayside League and Lothian League, later renamed Premiership North (17 clubs) and Premiership South (13 clubs). Matches restarted on 21 November 2020, but the season was declared null and void again on 16 March 2021.

In April 2021 another eleven clubs announced they were leaving the East Juniors for the East of Scotland League:
*Armadale Thistle
*Bathgate Thistle
*Bo&#x27;ness United (now called Bo&#x27;ness Athletic}
*Fauldhouse United
*Harthill Royal (applied to join West of Scotland Football League)
*Livingston United

*Pumpherston
*Stoneyburn
*Syngenta
*West Calder United
*Whitburn
Also in April 2021 it was announced that discussions were ongoing for clubs in the East Premiership North to form Midlands League at Tier 6 in the Scottish football league system, that would ultimately see clubs in the Midlands League play off against those in the North Caledonian League and North Superleague for a place in the Highland League. Although there was no official announcement of the league&#x27;s formation, the East Region announced the fixtures for the 2021-22 season straight away on 21 June, with 19 clubs shown as league members, Dundee St James and Letham being new clubs in addition to all members of the 2020–21 East Premiership North. 

==Cup competitions==
There are a number of cup competitions in the East Region:
* East Region League Cup - Known as the &quot;Thorntons Property East Region League Cup&quot; under a sponsorship arrangement, this tournament was introduced for the 2018–19 season to compensate for a reduced number of league fixtures. 
*North and Tayside Inter-Regional Cup - Known as the &quot;Quest Engineering Cup&quot; for sponsorship purposes, this is a knockout tournament for Midlands League and North Region clubs and is administered by a joint committee. First played for in 1988, clubs play early rounds in their own region with eight sides from each area progressing to the last sixteen.
&quot;Inactive&quot;

* Prior to league reconstruction in 2013, clubs also competed in one of three League Cup competitions at the beginning of the season:
** DJ Laing League Cup. This tournament was for former Tayside Region clubs excluding Perthshire sides affiliated to the Central Division. Clubs initially competed in groups (sections) with the group winners advancing to a knockout semi-final stage. In all league cup competitions, matches in the group stages were played under league rules so a player was not cup-tied by turning out for a particular club.
** ACA Sports League Cup. This tournament was for former Fife Region clubs and all other teams affiliated to the Central Division. Clubs initially competed in four groups, with group winners advancing to a knockout semi-final stage.
** Dechmont Forklift League Cup. This tournament was for former East (Lothian) Region clubs. Clubs initially competed in four groups, with group winners advancing to a knockout semi-final stage.

* Fife &amp; Lothians Cup - Known as the &quot;V Tech SMT Fife and Lothians Cup&quot; under a sponsorship arrangement, this tournament dates back to regionalisation in 1968 and is a knockout tournament for former East (Lothians) and Fife Region clubs in the current East Region. It is administered by a separate Fife &amp; Lothians committee.
* East of Scotland Cup - Known as the &quot;DJ Laing East Region Cup&quot; under a sponsorship arrangement, this is a knockout tournament for all Midlands League clubs. The competition dates back to 1896–97 and was the most prestigious cup trophy in the former East Region.

===Holders===
&quot;2021–22 winners unless stated.&quot;

*North and Tayside Inter-Regional Cup: East Craigie
*East Region League Cup: Lochee United

==Roll of Honour==




==Member clubs for 2022–23 season==
There are 27 clubs in the East Region for the 2022–23 season. 19 clubs in the Midlands League organised by the East Region, and 8 clubs transferred to the East of Scotland League who have retained their membership of the SJFA.

<doc id="432734" wikidata="Q1235354" url="?curid=432734" title="Dolby Pro Logic">
<text>Dolby Pro Logic is a surround sound processing technology developed by Dolby Laboratories, designed to decode soundtracks encoded with Dolby Surround. The terms [[Dolby Stereo]] and [[LtRt]] (&quot;Left Total&quot;, &quot;Right Total&quot;) are also used to describe soundtracks that are encoded using this technique. 

Dolby Stereo—also known as Dolby MP (&quot;Motion Picture&quot;) or Dolby SVA (&quot;stereo variable-area&quot;)—was developed by Dolby in 1976 for analog cinema sound systems. The format was adapted for home use in 1982 as Dolby Surround when HiFi capable consumer VCRs were introduced. It was further improved with the Dolby Pro Logic decoding system after 1987. 

The Dolby MP Matrix was the professional system that encoded four channels of film sound into two. This track used by the &quot;Dolby Stereo&quot; theater system on a 35mm optical stereo print and decoded back to the original 4.0 Surround. The same four-channel encoded stereo track was largely left unchanged and made available to consumers as &quot;Dolby Surround&quot; on home video. However, the original Dolby Surround decoders in 1982 were a simple passive matrix three-channel decoder: L/R and mono Surround. The surround channel was limited to 7 kHz. It also had Dolby Noise Reduction and an adjustable delay, for improved channel separation and to prevent dialog leaking and arriving to listeners&#x27; ears first. The front center channel was equally split between the left and right channels for phantom center reproduction. This differed from the Cinema Dolby Stereo system which used active steering and other processing to decode a center channel for dialog and center focused on-screen action.

Later on in 1987, the Pro Logic decoding system was released to consumers. It featured virtually the same type of four-channel decoding as the Dolby Stereo theater processor with active steering logic and much better channel separation (up to 30 dB) as well as including a dedicated center channel output for the first time. Many standalone Pro Logic decoders also included a phantom center option for compatibility with earlier non-Pro Logic Dolby Surround equipped home theaters to split the center channel signal to the L/R speakers for legacy phantom center reproduction.

Dolby Surround Pro Logic is the full name that refers to the matrix surround format and decoding system in one. When a Dolby Surround soundtrack is created in post-production (&quot;Dolby MP Matrix&quot;), four channels of sound are matrix-encoded into an ordinary stereo (two-channel) soundtrack. The center channel is reduced in level by 3 dB and summed to the left and right channels; the surround channel is attenuated by 3 dB, passes through a band-pass filter (cutting frequencies under 100 Hz and above 7 kHz), passes through Dolby B noise reduction and is encoded on the left and right channels with opposite polarity (this is achieved by applying a +90-degree phase shift to the left channel and a −90-degree phase shift to the right channel). The surround channel was often used for ambient background sounds in the original recording, music scores and effects.

A Dolby Pro Logic decoder/processor &quot;unfolds&quot; the soundtrack back into its original 4.0 surround—left and right, center, and a single limited frequency-range (7 kHz low-pass filtered) mono rear channel—while systems lacking the decoder play back the audio as standard stereo.

Although Dolby Surround was introduced as an analog format, all Dolby Digital decoders incorporate a digitally implemented Dolby Surround Pro Logic decoder for digital stereo signals that carry matrix-encoded Dolby Surround. One of the first was the MSP400 surround sound receiver and amplifier by RCA for their high-end Dimensia brand. It was released in 1987 for the Digital Command Component System.
==Dolby Surround==

Dolby Surround is the earliest consumer version of Dolby&#x27;s surround sound decoding technology. It was introduced to the public in 1982 during the time home video recording formats (such as Betamax and VHS) were introducing Stereo and HiFi capability. The name Dolby Surround described the consumer passive matrix decoding technology; the professional, active-matrix cinema technology bore the name Dolby Stereo. It was capable of decoding Dolby Stereo four-channel soundtracks to three output channels (Left, Right, Surround). The Center channel was fed equally to the Left and Right speakers. The Surround channel was limited to a 100 Hz to 7 kHz frequency bandwidth, as dialog from the center channel could leak into the surround channel—there was as little as 3 dB of separation between LCR and Surround channels.
==Dolby Pro Logic==

In 1987 the decoding technology was updated and renamed Dolby Pro Logic.

A Pro Logic decoder/processor &quot;unfolds&quot; the sound into the original 4.0 surround—left and right, center, and a single limited frequency-range (7 kHz low-pass filtered) mono rear channel.

A Pro Logic decoder also uses &#x27;Steering Logic&#x27;, which drives amplifiers to raise or lower the output volume of each channel based on the current dominant sound direction. For example, while a mono signal is played, the strong correlation to the center channel triggers the output volume of the left, right and surround channels to be lowered. This increases the channel separation achievable to around 30 decibels between channels. By careful tuning of the response of the amplifiers, the total amount of signal energy remains constant and is unaffected by the operation of the channel steering. Additionally, the response time of the system to changes in sound direction is important as too fast a response results in a twitchy feel, while too slow a response leaves sounds coming from an inappropriate direction.

In addition to 5 dB of noise reduction, the surround channel is slightly delayed, so that any front channel sounds that leak into the surround channel arrive at the listener after the front channels. This takes advantage of the Haas effect—audio that is present in the front speakers but delayed in the surround speakers will have the psychoacoustic effect of emanating from the front of the sound stage.

Dolby Surround and Dolby Pro Logic decoders are similar in principle, as both use matrix technology to extract extra channels from Dolby Stereo stereo-encoded audio. The terms Dolby Stereo, Dolby Surround and Lt/Rt are all used to describe soundtracks that are matrix-encoded using this technique.
==Dolby Pro Logic II==
In 2000, Dolby introduced Dolby Pro Logic II (DPL II), an improved implementation of Dolby Pro Logic created by Jim Fosgate. DPL II processes any high-quality stereo signal source into five separate full frequency channels (right front, center, left front, right rear and left rear), while also decoding five channels from stereo signals encoded in traditional four-channel Dolby Surround. DPL II implements greatly enhanced steering compared to DPL, and as a result, offers an exceptionally stable sound field that simulates five-channel surround sound.

Because of the limited nature of the original Dolby Pro Logic encoding, many consumer electronics manufacturers introduced their own processing circuitry, such as the &quot;Jazz&quot;, &quot;Hall&quot;, and &quot;Stadium&quot; modes found on most common home audio receivers. DPL II forgoes this type of processing and replaces it with simple servo (negative feedback) circuits used to derive five channels. The extra channel content is extracted using the difference between the spatial audio content between two individual channels of stereo tracks or Dolby Digital encoded 5.1 channel tracks and outputs it appropriately.

In addition to five full-range playback channels, Pro Logic II introduced a Music mode that includes optimized channel delays and adds user controls to—for example—adjust apparent sound stage width.

Pro Logic II systems also have a mode designed specifically for video games which is used in games for PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Wii as an alternative to digital surround formats such as Dolby Digital or DTS. Game mode is similar to Movie mode, except it redirects more bass to the LFE channel.
==Dolby Pro Logic IIx==

The Dolby Pro Logic IIx system, available since 2003, can take two-channel stereo, Dolby Surround (sometimes called Dolby Stereo Surround) and Dolby Digital 5.1 source material and up-convert it to 6.1 or 7.1 channel surround sound.
==Dolby Pro Logic IIz==

Dolby Pro Logic IIz expands on Pro Logic IIx with the addition of a height component, creating front height channels above the front left and right speakers, expanding a 5.1 or 7.1 system to 7.1 Height or 9.1. It identifies spatial cues in low-level, uncorrelated information, such as ambience and effects like rain or wind in the side and rear surround channels, and directs it to the front height speakers. The channels it adds are matrixed, not discrete.
== Dolby Surround (2014) ==

Dolby reintroduced the Dolby Surround terminology in 2014. The term now refers to a new upmixer whose purpose is to enable Dolby Atmos receivers and speaker configurations to serve non-Atmos signals.

Dolby Surround is a complete replacement for Pro Logic that upmixes stereo and multi-channel inputs to play over Atmos configurations.
== Software encoding and decoding ==
* The liba52 decoder library for AC3 and A52 digital sound optionally exports Lt/Rt stereo sound compatible with Pro Logic decoders.
* HandBrake and FFmpeg are capable of downmixing Dolby Digital AC-3 5.1 to Lt/Rt stereo tracks compatible with Dolby Pro Logic I &amp; II decoders.
* SurCode for Dolby Pro Logic II is a Dolby-certified software encoder and decoder available in plug-in formats for DAWs and as a standalone application.

== Hardware encoding ==
* Dolby Digital (AC3) compatible hardware (DVDs, TVs, Blu-ray players) downmixes the 5.1 channel tracks into Lt/Rt stereo compatible with Pro Logic decoders

<text>The Daily Sport was a tabloid newspaper published in the United Kingdom by Daily Sport Ltd., which specialised in celebrity news and softcore pornographic stories and images. The daily paper was launched in 1991 by David Sullivan, following its former Sunday sister title, &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; (first published in 1986). It ceased publication and entered administration on 1 April 2011.

Following the purchase on 7 June by the telecom, travel and internet entrepreneur Grant Miller, the new online &quot;Daily Sport&quot; was relaunched on 17 August 2011 with sports coverage plus classified advertising for the first time in its twenty-year history. There are not thought to be any plans for a print relaunch; however, &quot;Midweek Sport&quot;, &quot;Weekend Sport&quot; and &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; are still published by Sunday Sport (2011) Ltd.

==Focus and content==
The &quot;Daily Sport&quot; did not normally include news, although in 2008 Lembit Öpik (then a Liberal Democrat MP) began a regular weekly political column. Instead, its coverage indulged more in tabloid journalism, with an emphasis on celebrities, bad behaviour and toilet humour.

The &quot;Daily Sport&quot;, like the &quot;Sunday Sport&quot;, was known for ridiculous headlines to entirely fabricated stories. Later editorial practice meant an end to such stories and an increased focus on celebrity news and sexual revelations.

&quot;Daily Sport&quot; often published fake nude pictures of celebrities and also paparazzi &#x27;upskirt&#x27; and &#x27;downblouse&#x27; or nipple slip pictures. The fake nude pictures were published with the appropriate disclaimers and captions, although the front cover image was often accompanied by a titillating caption, like &quot;Tender tips make tastier tea&quot;. In September 2008, &quot;The Sport&quot; was criticised by the Press Complaints Commission for glamourising suicide by publishing a &quot;Top yourself tourism list&quot;.

A large portion of advertising was for adult goods and services, such as phone-sex chat lines and Internet chat and sexually intimate sites. A feature of the paper was the classified advertisements, which in reality were a series of short advertisements for massage parlours and escort services across the country. In later years, the classified adverts had also become a place for swingers to advertise.

The &quot;Daily Sport&quot; pioneered the football crossword in the United Kingdom. The soccer crossword positioned in the back pages alongside the football journalists reports was unique in the fact that the clues were solely devoted to questions which related to the country&#x27;s national game. After two years of his work appearing in the &quot;Daily Sport&quot; the grid also became a regular feature in the &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; editions.

The &quot;Sport&quot; claimed to have launched the careers of numerous models, among them Louise Hodges who modeled throughout the 1990s Linsey Dawn McKenzie, who began posing topless for the newspaper in 1994, and Cherry Dee who began posing topless for them in 2003 when they were both 16 (the legal age for such activity in the United Kingdom at the time). Among recent popular &quot;Sport&quot; models were Kelly Bell, Hannah Claydon and Lauren Pope; however, very few &quot;Sport&quot; models also appeared in the other tabloids which the paper regarded as its rivals.

The &quot;Daily Sport&quot; and &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; were sold by David Sullivan to Sport Media Group in 2007. The papers were relaunched in April 2008 under the editorial leadership of Barry McIlheney and James Brown, the founder of &quot;Loaded&quot;. In October 2008, Pam McVitie was appointed the first female editor of the &quot;Daily Sport&quot;. In 2009, SMG had to be bailed out by David Sullivan and Gold Group International, after having been put up for sale by its owners.

Publication was suspended from 1 April 2011 after Sport Media Group ceased trading and was broken up by administrators. Entrepreneur Grant Miller acquired the rights to the &quot;Daily Sport&quot; and relaunched it online through a new company Daily Sport Limited. Sullivan now publishes the &quot;Midweek Sport&quot; (Wednesdays), &quot;Weekend Sport&quot; (Fridays) and &quot;Sunday Sport&quot;, through his company Sunday Sport (2011) Limited.

==Circulation==
Circulation levels in 2009 were 84,000 and rising, but they then fell sharply with the company&#x27;s financial difficulties. The publication now only exists online.

<doc id="432742" wikidata="Q987190" url="?curid=432742" title="History of infant schools in Great Britain">
<text>The first infant school in Great Britain was founded in New Lanark, Scotland, in 1816. It was followed by other philanthropic infant schools across Great Britain. Early childhood education was a new concept at the time and seen as a potential solution to social problems related to industrialisation. Numerous writers published works on the subject and developed a theory of infant teaching. This included moral education, physical exercise and an authoritative but friendly teacher.

In England and Wales, infant schools served to maximise the education children could receive before they left school to start work. They were valued by parents as a form of childcare but proved less popular in Scotland. State-funded schools in England and Wales were advised in 1840 to include infant departments within their grounds. As it was integrated into the state system, infant education in England and Wales came under pressure to achieve quick academic progress in children and shifted towards rote learning. The new &quot;kindergarten&quot; methods of teaching young children had some limited influence on the curriculum in the late 19th century.

Beginning in 1905, infant education in England and Wales shifted towards more child-centred methods of teaching, where education was meant to reflect the preferences of children. Many of the youngest children, under five, who were considered ill-suited to school, were removed entirely, though some nursery classes were later attached to infant schools to cater to this age group. The child-centred approach reached its peak following a report in 1967. In 1988, a more centralised curriculum was introduced, but there have been moves away from that in Wales since devolution. The term &quot;infant department&quot; for the early years at school was used widely in Scotland in the 1960s but is no longer generally used there. 

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;infant school&quot; is used in the United Kingdom. It might refer to a separate school or a department within a larger school. Dictionaries give various age ranges for this phase of education. Cambridge describes infant schools as &quot;for children who are four to seven years old&quot;. Collins defines them as &quot;for children between the ages of five and seven&quot;. Merriam-Webster uses the age range from &quot;five to seven or eight&quot;. Oxford does not give a lower age limit, just stating &quot;usually under seven years of age&quot;. A UK government document published in 2013 described &quot;infant (5 to 7 or 8)&quot; as the middle phase of primary education in England and Wales but commented that &quot;in Scotland and Northern Ireland there is generally no distinction between infant and junior schools.&quot;

== Background ==
Before the 19th century, children learnt the skills needed for work and home life from their families at an early age. Children below the age of eight frequently attended the village or grammar schools. No particular accommodation would have been made for the younger children as these were single-room institutions that catered to a wide range of ages. It was preferred that the limited group of children who had access to schooling start their education at home. The concept of a school for very young children is a relatively modern phenomenon as the idea that formal education can be tailored to the specific needs of young children is relatively new. There are some examples of institutions similar to infant schools in continental Western Europe dating from the later 18th century.

The agricultural and industrial revolutions had a disruptive effect on the lives of many children. New forms of child labour developed in factories, which enforced more intensive and disciplined conditions than children had experienced while working under the supervision of parents in pre-industrial times. While factory labourers were typically (but not exclusively) older than eight, children as young as three years did contractual work at home or were employed as climbing boys to clean the inside of chimneys. Many young children with working mothers were left alone or in the care of older children. Dame schools provided a cheap childminding service, generally with low standards of care and education.

Interest developed in expanding access to education as this situation came to public attention. Reformers attempted to protect children from suffering, while instructing them in morality, religion and obedience. The British and Foreign School Society (established 1808) and the National Society for Promoting Religious Education (established 1811) were established to found new &quot;voluntary schools&quot;. These schools were intended for children of &quot;school age&quot;, which was understood to mean older than six or usually seven although children as young as four years were sometimes admitted. Joseph Lancaster (1778–1838), an influential educational theorist, believed that &quot;initiatory&quot; schools should be created to provide safety and education focused on personal character to children younger than seven years. However, the societies did not aim to cater for the younger age group and no initiatory schools were established. From 1833 the two societies began to receive government funding.

== Early infant schools ==

=== First establishments ===
The first infant school in Great Britain was established in 1816 for the children of mill workers in New Lanark, Lanarkshire, in Scotland. It was founded by Robert Owen, who was manager of the cotton mills there. The school catered for children between one and six years old. Information about this infant school is quite limited, accounts often focus more on the uniqueness of the experiment rather than the activities that took place in the school. The children appear to have spent much of their time playing, but some formal education also took place. In 1819, children under the age of four were reported to be learning to recognise letters. Older children were organised into a different class and taught to read simple texts. Owen believed that every aspect of a child&#x27;s personality was formed by the circumstances in which they grew up and saw the infant school as a way of minimising negative influences from the family home. He saw child labour as damaging and forbade children under the age of ten from working in his factory. Owen was sceptical of toys and the children largely did activities that did not require physical objects such as singing, dancing, and marching.

In 1818, the first infant school in England was sponsored by Henry Brougham, and other political radicals, in Brewer&#x27;s Green, Westminster, London. Brougham did believe that the first years of life were developmentally important, but placed less value on early education than Owen. He was primarily interested in providing childcare and moral instruction. He employed James Buchanan, a teacher who had previously worked at New Lanark and used similar methods to the first infant school. The families who lived in the slums around Brewer&#x27;s Green were initially reluctant to send their children to the infant school. Brougham put significant effort into recruitment and numbers increased sharply over several months. Two further infant schools were established in London over the next six years. The London Infant School Society was active from 1824 to 1835. It had some success with founding new infant schools but less in training teachers. The London Society was followed by other regional societies including in Leicester and Glasgow. Employers also established factory infant schools with the aim of preparing pupils to be better-behaved child labourers when they started work.

=== Theory and motivation ===
Samuel Wilderspin was a major advocate of infant schools across England. The philosophy he promulgated had more emphasis on formal instruction than Owen&#x27;s, though he tried to adapt the instruction to the abilities of young children. Nanette Whitbread, an educationalist, suggests that Wilderspin had some understanding of young children but lacked a &quot;unifying pedagogical theory&quot;. In Glasgow, David Stow was a major promoter of infant schools who remained truer to Owen&#x27;s aims even with an increased focus on class teaching. Various other figures also established infant schools and wrote books about the subject. David Turner, an academic who studied 19th-century infant schools, wrote that the pedagogy of the various early iterations of infant schools were heavily influenced by Owen&#x27;s ideas. He commented;

By the mid 1830&#x27;s the schools had sometimes become training grounds for the lower classes, to accustom them to good habits and industry and to prepare them for National [Society for Promoting Religious Education] or British [and Foreign School Society] schools. There was an increasing emphasis on religion, yet the essentials of the system remained: the acceptance of very young children; learning through play; a variety of short lessons; exercise in the playground, and the cultivation of kindly feelings. Some of the methods sometimes deteriorated into mere rote-learning and marching displays ... but the system had at least permeated the country, and had survived through the pioneering efforts of enthusiastic individuals and the financial support of enlightened philanthropists.

The ideals of infant schools were contradictory. They were supposed to be both an ordered environment and give children freedom. Children were seen in a generally positive light and as likely to cooperate if well managed. They would ideally develop an affectionate relationship with the teacher, that would motivate them to learn. These ideas had little connection to a philosophy about child development or education. Some links existed to the ideas of Emanuel Swedenborg, a Swedish philosopher. There were also connections between the infant school movement and phrenology, a pseudoscientific theory about how human thought works that was popular at the time. But the focus of those promoting infant schools was on the practical issue of finding cheap and effective ways to educate large groups of young children.

Promoters of infant schools were interested in reducing petty crime and protecting property. The years after 1811 saw a sharp increase in birth rates. Juvenile crime rates increased as young children were often left alone while their parents and older siblings worked. , a historian, argued that people associated the threat posed to their property by crime with the perceived threat posed to their property by politics (i.e. a revolution in the style of the French Revolution). Alasdair Roberts, an educationalist, suggests that the decline in financial support given to infant school societies in the late 1820s, as revolutionary activity declined, might be evidence of this. There were also a variety of motivations for supporters of various ideological views. In England, the focus was usually on child welfare along with inculcating moral virtues, discipline and practical skills. In Scotland, where the concept of mass schooling was more established, there was greater interest in adapting education for young children. Some people opposed the infant schools, worrying about Owen&#x27;s socialist political views or seeing them as a form of interference in family life.

=== Evolution ===
Overall in Britain, the early infant school movement was strongest in London and Glasgow. Stephens, an historian, is sceptical of the movement, suggesting that infant schools gradually lost most of their distinctiveness and failed to become the preferred childcare option for working-class parents. Teachers, who were largely untrained and under pressure from the lack of time children had to attend school, often focused on introducing children to discipline and formal instruction. Infant schools frequently evolved into institutions focused on preparing children for the voluntary schools, neglecting more play-based aspects of the curriculum. Whitbread argued that this did not reflect the priorities of parents, who were often quite happy to send their children to infant schools that offered some entertainment, in preference to dame schools. In contrast, Roberts argued that early infant schools had limited appeal because working-class parents did not see the value of schools where children appeared to spend their time playing, and resented what they saw as a middle-class attempt to influence their children. He gives examples of infant schools that closed in the 1830s.

Whitbread comments that the early infant schools offered safety and a degree of compassion to young children living in a difficult environment with few other options. Laura Novo, an academic at Columbia University, comments that infant schools were more open to new methods than most other aspects of 19th century teaching. By 1836, there were 3,000 infant schools in England alone, attended by 90,000 children. They usually catered to both boys and girls. Early infant schools were sometimes used to teach English to Welsh- or Scottish Gaelic-speaking children; Wilderspin believed they were effective at language teaching.

== Mid-19th century development ==
=== Theoretical influences, training and inspection ===

Interest developed in the educational theories of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. He believed that lessons should be conducted in a way that, though still guided by a teacher, gave the child more autonomy to think for themselves. For instance, the pupil might be allowed to examine an object before being told what it was. Pestalozzi was not primarily interested in teaching young children, but in Britain, it was infant schools where he had the most influence. The Home and Colonial Infants School Society was founded in 1836 to train infant teachers and promote Pestalozzi&#x27;s technique. By the 1840s, school inspectors preferred infant schools that used teachers trained by the society. 

The Home and Colonial Infant School Society was the largest training college for infant teachers and was considered to be of a high standard. It also supplied equipment and teaching materials to infant schools. The college was an Anglican institution but also taught Nonconformists. Infant schools had a religious element to their teaching; Elizabeth Mayo, a prominent figure in the Home and Colonial Infant School Society, argued that religious and moral education should be the &quot;paramount object&quot; of infant schools. Though they tended to be quite non-sectarian by the standards of the time.

In 1840, guidance issued for newly introduced school inspectors in England and Wales mentioned specific questions for them to ask in infant schools. For instance, &quot;What amusements have the children?&quot; and &quot;Are the children trained in walking, marching, and physical exercises, methodically?&quot;. Roberts suggests that some of the questions indicate a desire to avoid rote learning and maintain the original spirit of the system: for example, &quot;Are the replies of the children made intelligently or mechanically or by rote? Do they appear to have confidence in their master or mistress [teacher] and to regard them with affection?&quot;. One school inspector, HMI Fletcher, wrote in 1845 about the infant system &quot;in the course of improvement in which it appears to be embarked, its preparatory labours will constantly increase in value as they become wider in scope and less ambitious in their immediate aim ... an education at once physical, intellectual, industrial, moral and religious.&quot; The school inspectorate usually supported the infant system but there was some opposition, especially from those who wanted an early start to academic education.

The monitorial system, which allowed a single teacher to educate a larger class by using a number of older children as intermediaries, was being used in some infant schools in the 1840s, with children up to nine years old acting as assistant teachers.

=== Teaching methods ===
In the mid-19th century, there was some ambiguity over the purpose of infant education. School inspectors believed that an infant stage of education was beneficial even if it &quot;did nothing but contribute to their [the children&#x27;s] health and cheerfulness&quot; but also said children should be taught &quot;to read an easy little narrative lesson, have the first notions of numbers, and be able to write on a slate&quot;. The &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; reported on a local infant school in 1835, &quot;They seldom sit on their seats more than fifteen minutes at a time without exercise. All is joyous activity—only pictures and objects are in use, and one-third of their time is spent in amusements in the playground.&quot; Research by a Royal Commission in 1861 indicated that older schoolchildren who had attended an infant school tended to be significantly ahead of those who had not. Nanette Whitbread commented on infant schools in this period:

Infant schools in England and Scotland by mid-century had certain characteristic features. The schoolroom was a large hall complete with gallery for simultaneous instruction, and the walls were lined with black boarding for the children to draw and write on. A playground, equipped with such apparatus as swings and see-saws, was required in any new infant school applying for grant. The curriculum included drawing, music, physical exercises, sewing, knitting, gardening, at least the preliminary steps towards reading and sometimes writing, and Pestalozzian &#x27;object lessons&#x27; on natural objects and domestic utensils.

Tiered galleries were structures in which children were seated in progressively higher rows, used when the whole class was being lectured by a teacher. Galleries were intended to restrict the movement of older children placed at the back, while giving them a clear view of the teacher as a reminder that they were being watched. It was hoped this would encourage self-control. The routine of entering and leaving the gallery reinforced the power hierarchy within the infant school.

Playgrounds were a new concept in the 19th century that had an important role in infant schools. Walled-in, in theory supervised, play areas were seen as a way to control children and thereby teach them to accept adult authority. Teachers were advised to allow accidents and minor incidents of bad behaviour; these could be used later as a negative example in a lesson about correct conduct. Play could take place indoors, but ideally an outdoor playground would be available which was designed to recreate the natural world. Children were provided with various equipment—such as building blocks, vaulting ropes and rotating swings—designed to develop the practical skills and physical strength needed for manual work. Play was often conducted in a disciplined, structured manner. For instance, children were expected to tidy away the blocks and wait in line while others used the swings. Some of the equipment was potentially dangerous, requiring significant skill and adult guidance to use correctly. For instance, Wilderspin&#x27;s advice book on infant teaching included a chapter covering playground safety, that largely focused on swings.

=== Growth ===
The number of infant schools was growing rapidly by the middle of the 19th century. A second wave of industrialisation related to steam power and Irish immigration due to the Great Famine had led to the British population increasing. In 1851 around a quarter of people in Britain were children younger than ten years. Conditions worsened in the industrial slums and dame schools as the youthful population became more urbanised. This meant that infant schools increased in appeal and were often outstripped by demand. These schools&#x27; relatively low fees became more affordable as skilled workers&#x27; wages began to gradually increase after about 1842.

== Integration into state system and rote learning ==

=== Infant departments in state-funded schools ===
The number of children under seven in schools for older children increased in the middle of the 19th century. The first effective restrictions on the labour of children under the age of about nine or ten years were being introduced in some industries and technological advancement was reducing the usefulness of child labour. This meant that the number of seven-to-ten-year-old children available to attend school increased. Parents often relied on older children to provide childcare for younger children so they sent their three-to-six-year-old children to school with their older siblings. 19.8% of three to six-year-olds were attending schools for older children in 1861. School inspectors felt that large numbers of children younger than seven in schools for older children were disruptive to teaching. They did not want to entirely exclude these younger children to avoid older children being kept home to provide childcare. It also seemed sensible to start teaching at an early age as children did not tend to stay at school for long. A parliamentary committee in 1838 concluded that education should be made available to working-class children from the age of three years. In 1840 the Council on Education in England and Wales;directed that a collateral series of plans of school-houses should be drawn, in which an infant school and playground are added to the schoolroom for children above six years of age, in the hope that these plans may promote the adoption of arrangements ... for the combination of an infant school with the [older] boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; school.

The 1870 Education Act made five years the minimum age at which school boards could make education compulsory. Some people believed it was too young; but it was felt that young children could be taught moral lessons at an early age, were safer in school and children who started school sooner could be released to start work sooner. The 1880 Education Act made five years the start of compulsory education across England and Wales. Britain was unusual in the Western World in having that early a start to mandatory education. Many children as young as two or three years were also enrolled at school. The proportion of children between three and five years at school increased throughout the remainder of the 19th century from 24.2% in 1870 to 43.1% in 1900. The relatively small number of children under three years in school increased in the early 1870s but fell thereafter. The skilled working classes, whose wages were broadly going up throughout this period, made use of infant schools as childcare for their preschool children. Many poorer families sent their children to school before the age of five when fees were abolished at elementary schools in 1891. This largely brought about the end of dame schools. Some children who lived a long way from the nearest school were not sent until after the infant stage.

The rise of young children attending school was not seen in Scotland to the same extent as in England and Wales. The philanthropic infant school movement had faded in Scotland by the middle of the century. The 1861 and 1871 censuses found that Scottish children under the age of five were much less likely to be in school than their English or Welsh counterparts. The Education (Scotland) Act 1872 also introduced a start to compulsory education at five years old in Scotland. Only a minority of five-year-olds in Scotland were enrolled at school until around 1900. It appears that the Scottish school boards did not tend to enforce the school starting age. Both Scottish teachers and parents seemed to lack enthusiasm for infant education, seeing little value in lessons for younger children who were less able to respond to formal instruction.

=== Curriculum and facilities ===
The payment by results system of funding schools was introduced in 1862. Children under six were exempt from individual examinations and the exemption was expanded to children under seven a decade later. The system encouraged more emphasis on teaching the three r&#x27;s (reading, writing and arithmetic) at the infant stage to prepare for examinations in later years. The focus of teaching in infant schools moved towards rote learning. In some schools, infants were given little attention by teachers as they did not receive grants for examination. An investigation into infant schools, conducted in 1870, found that they were typically broken into two classes. In the &quot;babies class&quot;, for the under fives, children were taught &quot;to speak clearly, to understand pictures, to recite the alphabet and to march to music&quot;. The &quot;infants class&quot; for the five-to-seven-year-olds taught &quot;a curriculum based on the three Rs, simple manual tasks and sewing.&quot; Babies&#x27; classes were inadequate for the youngest children; often overcrowded, using pens to keep children in their seats and led by adolescent or unqualified teachers.

New infant schools were required to include a playground from 1871, fourteen years before a similar obligation was introduced for other new schools. Regulations also required separation between infant children and their older peers. Schools increasingly had a dedicated adult teacher for the infants. School boards frequently put specific expectations on infant schools. For instance, Bradford School Board&#x27;s infant schools were instructed to emphasise singing lessons and &quot;and such physical exercises as are practised in infant school&quot;. Turner states that many infant schools reflecting the ideas of the early movement continued to exist. He argued that this sometimes created a &quot;new humane and enjoyable approach to teaching&quot; which was often supported by school inspectors. Although infant teaching was less established in Scotland, these kind of methods were also gradually introduced there, influenced by the situation in England. In Wales, where many children were learning English as a second language, Welsh was sometimes used extensively with infants and they were less likely to be punished for speaking it.

This was a period when the ideas of Frederick Froebel were being imported into Britain through &quot;kindergartens&quot; aimed at the middle classes. He had developed a number of &quot;gifts&quot; and &quot;occupations&quot; which were designed to improve young children&#x27;s understanding of the physical world. Froebel put an emphasis on the value of play and felt that children should not be formally educated until they were motivated to learn. A mixture of practical considerations and class prejudice meant that his ideas were broadly considered unsuitable for infant schools. The government wanted to quickly establish basic literacy and numeracy among children who would leave school at an early age. Theories about what it meant to give children a broader education were not important to this goal. Froebel&#x27;s ideas were hard to implement in large classes of children whose parents could usually give them little support at home. Whitbread comments that officials &quot;were not concerned with the development of rational human beings but with ensuring a literate proletariat&quot;. However attempts were made to introduce some of Froebel&#x27;s methods into infant schools, often turning them into whole-class activities that lost much of their original value.

Infant classes in the early 1900s were almost always separated from the older children in all but the smallest village schools. They were generally large with fifty or sixty children seated in rows. The culture of the payment-by-results system remained even though the system had formally ended. Instruction focused on the three R&#x27;s taught, to a large extent, through rote learning. There was an emphasis on discipline and conformity across the curriculum. For instance, pupils were forced to write with their right hand, art lessons consisted of exactly copying an image provided by the teacher and physical education took the form of drills along with marching on occasion to martial music. Some schools were starting to take a more informal approach to teaching babies&#x27; classes for those under fivefor instance, using moveable furniture and in a few of the more liberal-minded schools allowing periods of free play with toysthough, class instruction in the three R&#x27;s was a major part of the teaching of even this youngest group.

== Shift to child-centred approach ==

=== Edwardian era ===
High levels of military recruit rejection on health grounds during the Second Boer War drew the government&#x27;s attention to the poor living conditions experienced by much of the British population. The Inter-Departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration was established and released its report on public health in 1904. Witnesses spoken to by the inquiry believed that schools were damaging the health of children who were sent early by working mothers. Young pupils were reportedly being prevented from moving around and made to do tasks they were not yet developmentally ready for. Some witnesses said that nurseries rather than schools were needed for children between three and five years. Female school inspectors were asked to do a further report on children under the age of five attending school. This report, released in 1905, was very critical, commenting &quot;that the children between the ages of three and five get practically no intellectual advantage from school instruction ... the evidence is very strong against attempts at formal instruction for any children under five&quot;. The report said that children from the poorest households gained a health benefit from being removed from the home, but that nurseries were preferable to schools.

From the government&#x27;s point of view, there were a variety of economic and practical reasons for excluding children under five from school and new guidance issued to local education authorities in 1905 allowed them to do that. All children under three had been removed from infant school by 1904. The proportion of three-and-four-year-olds in England and Wales at school fell to 22.7% in 1910 and 13.1% in 1930. While there were some efforts to create nurseries aimed at the working classes, except for a brief expansion during the First World War to free up mothers to work in the ammunition factories, it would be some time before a significant number were created. Mothers often used childminders if school was not available. 

The 1905 code for elementary schools encouraged infant schools and classes to move away from a focus on reaching a particular standard of attainment in the three R&#x27;s. They would instead emphasise &quot;the more general aim of encouraging mental and physical growth and of developing good habits&quot;. Lessons for five-to-seven-year-olds were to be a maximum of fifteen minutes long. Children of this age would be &quot;trained to listen carefully, to speak clearly, to recite easy pieces, to reproduce simple stories and narratives, to do simple things with their hands, to begin to draw, to begin to read and write, to observe, to acquire an elementary knowledge of number&quot;.

A year later the ideas of John Dewey came to British attention after the publication of a collection of his essays. Dewey argued that lessons for young children should reflect the spirit of Froebel&#x27;s ideas rather than using the specific &quot;gifts&quot; and &quot;occupations&quot; he had suggested. Dewey felt this meant using the kind of activities children were naturally interested in as a basis for teaching. A new attitude developed in infant education that was more open-minded about teaching methods and placed greater emphasis on child development. A senior school inspector Edmond Holmes wrote in 1911 that &quot;the atmosphere of the good infant schools is ... freer, more recreative, and truly educative than that of the upper schools of equivalent merit&quot;. Welsh became the dominant language at infant schools or departments in Welsh-speaking areas of Wales during the early 20th century.

Ivan G. Grimshaw and Maude Morgan Thomas were two British-born immigrants to the United States who wrote children&#x27;s books about their childhoods during this period. Both of the authors discussed their first years at school; Grimshaw noted &quot;I was enrolled in the Infant School, which was the equivalent of the American kindergarten&quot;, while Morgan Thomas just used the American term &quot;kindergarten&quot;. They both remarked on the age of starting school; Grimshaw commented &quot;I was only three years of age ... as it was customary to begin the work very early&quot;, while Morgan Thomas mentioned, &quot;Welsh children usually began school at a very early age, many of them as young as three years&quot;. They both described doing craftwork in lessons; &quot;After folding circular pieces of paper many times, we puffed them out by blowing on them. A great many of these were fastened together to make bright-colored balls which we hung in our homes for decoration.&quot; and &quot;we modeled in plasticine, making birds&#x27; nests and filling them with eggs, and rolling endless snakes.&quot; Morgan Thomas summarised that her early years at school were &quot;very pleasant&quot; and mentioned being rewarded for achievements. Grimshaw described his infant teacher warmly.

=== Interwar period ===

Around the time of the First World War, a substantial reform movement grew out of various groups with grievances towards the education system. There was a general desire for social change and a belief had developed among some people that schools were a repressive part of an unnatural society. This led to the development of a new type of child-centred infant education in the interwar period. The new philosophy drew on various sources, including the work of Susan Isaacs and ideas from America or continental Europe. The main principle of this method was that activities were based on the preferences of the child. Good infant schools of this era used a variety of methods to encourage the children to expand their interests. For instance, pupils would be exposed to writing in the classroom to encourage a desire to learn to read. This was especially important to those from the poorest households who might have almost illiterate parents with no books. Subjects such as &quot;nature study, pre-history, and craft-work&quot; were introduced, based on the idea that children recreated humanity&#x27;s intellectual development throughout history in their play. Subjects such as drama and music, along with speech and language activities, were also included. Project work played a major role in the teaching of older infants, especially. A class might also keep a pet. 

There were flaws in the child centred system; some teachers failed to teach reading to poorer pupils who had no reason to develop an interest in the subject outside of school. Large classes in older schools were often ill-suited to the new methods, while new infant schools were more suitable but frequently inadequate. Child-centred practices were not universal and some schools used a significant amount of formal instruction in the older style. The Hadow reports of 1931 and 1933 broadly encouraged the child-centred approach. The second report recommended that children in the final year of infant school should receive some instruction in the three R&#x27;s and younger children could begin learning to read when they were interested. However, it was felt the bulk of time should be spent on other activities. Infant schools had a positive reputation across the western world in the 1930s. While school inspectors generally supported the new ethos, there was some opposition. For instance, a political appointment in the Board of Education, Lord Eustace Percy later wrote in his memoirs: &quot;Educational philosophy had become dangerously romantic since the [First World] war ... It aimed at civilizing children rather than instructing them&quot;.

Meanwhile, in the 1930s, efforts to expand nursery provision were starting to have some effect. Several new nursery classes were added to infant schools and the proportion of three-and-four-year-olds at school increased marginally after multiple decades of decline. Nurseries tended to have an attached playground and beds for naptime. Children were encouraged to play educational games, physically exercise and become more self-reliant. The curriculum also included musical activities and listening to stories. During the Second World War, the government established multiple childcare schemes for preschool children. Education was a secondary aim of these schemes; they were intended primarily to free up mothers for war work and maintain children&#x27;s health. Exposure to nursery methods encouraged infant schools in some areas to include more emphasis on play in their own teaching. Many middle-class mothers sent their children to infant schools or enrolled them in the childcare schemes for practical reasons during the war years, making middle-class children attending infant schools more socially acceptable.

==Part of primary education==

=== Post-war era ===
The Education Act 1944 placed the infant stage in primary education. Local education authorities often found it practical to build combined primary schools in new housing estates created by the post-war housing programme. The proportion of infant schools and departments that were separate schools fell from more than 70% before the Second World War to 56% in 1965. More middle-class parents sent their children to state schools, at least initially, than in pre-war times. The child-centred approach became increasingly dominant in infant schools, though more focus was placed on teaching the three R&#x27;s. Studies had suggested that delayed teaching of reading could lead to a child&#x27;s abilities in the subject being permanently stunted. The portion of three-and-four-year-olds at school declined during the post-war baby boom. The priority of the authorities was on catering to children of compulsory school age. Historians Gareth Elwyn Jones and Gordon Wynne Roderick give the following description of 1950s infant school teaching:

In the first year, the &quot;reception class&quot;, children were usually occupied with activities similar to those in a nursery school, but were also taught to acquire the rudiments of reading and number, learned to draw and paint and to measure and weigh, while music, dance and movement also played an important part. Teaching methods with the older children varied: some teachers relied on formal instruction, others on informal individual and group activities.

In the interwar period, greater interest had developed in the effect the school environment had on children. The many new schools built in the period after the Second World War were designed to make pupils feel comfortable. An environment that was varied and appealing was seen as an important part of teaching a younger age group, and a reminiscence to a family home was felt to be especially important for infants. Furnishings were scaled down to be easily used by young children and a clear view of the outdoors was included in the design. Space was also set aside for physical activity, which was seen as important for teaching children how to cope with personal freedom. Building guidelines encouraged simple equipment in playgrounds, ideally made out of natural materials; for instance, &quot;the youngest children will enjoy a simple bank to roll down, or a low wall to balance on&quot;. Interest in the physical environment of the school declined among educationalists by the early 1970s.

The Plowden Report in 1967 endorsed the child-centred approach and gave additional autonomy to teachers. Some infant schools responded to this by organising children into mixed-age classes and giving them much more autonomy over their choice of activities. In this type of system, a child had the same teacher throughout their time at infant school. The seven-year-olds would leave at the end of each school year and the almost five-year-olds would join at various points during the year. The classroom was divided into different areas where different skills were worked on; children could move between them when they liked. A few mandatory whole class activities also took place. A 1970 academic report argued that structuring teaching in this manner made lessons more effective and comfortable for both the children and the teacher.

A 1969 academic report commented that the first three years of primary school in Scotland, beginning at the age of five, were known as the infant department. These departmentsdescribed as &quot;bright and happy places for learning&quot;were reportedly similar to their equivalents in England. Teachers said that children could usually read by the end of the first year. The report described Scottish primary schools as generally having more emphasis on formal instruction and discipline than their English counterparts but does not specify if this was true of infant departments.

=== Modern period ===
A backlash developed against the &quot;progressive&quot; method of teaching in the 1970s. While there is no evidence of concern among parents; sections of the political debate began to argue that schools were performing poorly academically and lacked discipline. The 1988 Education Reform Act introduced far more centralised control over state schools with a standardised curriculum and testing being introduced. The primary curriculum consisted of &quot;three &#x27;core subjects&#x27; (mathematics, English and science); six foundation subjects (history, geography, technology, music, art and physical education)&quot;. Teachers of five-to-seven-year-olds were sceptical of these changes and remained close to previous child-centred practices. A 2004 study examined infant classes in England and compared them to the teaching of children of the same age in France. It found that the English schools tended to treat children in a more personalised way; giving them different work based on ability and considering how much effort a child had put into their work when marking it.

Children who had been less well prepared for school at home were given more time to play, in order to develop the skills they had been lacking. The English teachers rarely directly told children if there was a problem with their work, out of concern about their happiness. For instance, if a child had answered a mathematical problem incorrectly the teacher would vaguely allude to the issue (&quot;I think you need to check this one&quot;) or emphasise the positives (&quot;good try, actually it&#x27;s less than that&quot;). Creativity was emphasised in written work; spelling and grammar was considered less of a priority when children were first beginning to write. Children progressed from drawing pictures to writing only the sounds they recognised and eventually began to write unknown words phonetically. In 2006, a report by Jim Rose, Director of Ofsted, recommended synthetic phonicsan approach where children are taught to recognise the sounds represented by letters. This method quickly became the principal method of teaching reading to young children in England, to a greater extent than most of the English-speaking world.

During the mid-1990s, a voucher programme was introduced to allow parents of young children to receive state-funding for childcare. Many schools had free space available due to falling birth rates and encouraged parents to use the vouchers to send their four-year-olds to school early. While the scheme was short-lived, it led to reception classes being established in many schools, though there was little clarity on what or how these classes were supposed to teach. In 2000, the Early Years Foundation Stage was introduced in England to set guidance for educating young children up to the age of five with an emphasis on play and informal learning, including in reception classes. Though some reception classes reportedly emphasised formal instruction in order to prepare children for Key Stage 1.

The creation of the National Assembly for Wales in 1999 began an era of greater divergence in education policy between Wales and England. A new curriculum, the Foundation Phase, was introduced in Wales for children of three to seven years from 2008 onwards. The curriculum was intended to have more emphasis on play and give children greater control over their lessons. In 2022, primary schools in Wales switched to a new curriculum that gave more autonomy to teachers. In 2024, ITV News published a report on the relatively poor reading abilities of Welsh children compared to other parts of the UK. It argued that this was linked to schools in Wales encouraging young children to use pictures to guess the meaning of unknown words as well as phonics.

In 2018, it was reported that about 10% of children in England attended separate infant schools or &quot;first schools&quot; (schools which take children up to eight or nine years). There were approximately 1,700 of these schools, 1,000 less than a decade earlier. An analysis suggested that children who attended these schools likely achieved a similar level of academic attainment to other children. At the same time, there were 28 separate infant schools in Wales. The final separate infant school in Scotland closed in July 2024.

<text>The Agenzia nazionale per le nuove tecnologie, l&#x27;energia e lo sviluppo economico sostenibile (ENEA; &quot;Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development&quot;) is an Italian Government-sponsored research and development agency. The agency undertakes research in areas which will help to develop and enhance Italian competitiveness and employment, while protecting the environment. ENEA is an acronym that stands for &quot;Energia Nucleare ed Energie Alternative&quot; (&quot;Atomic Energy and Alternative Energy&quot;).

==History==

Initially (1982), ENEA was an acronym that stood for &quot;Energia Nucleare ed Energie Alternative&quot; (&quot;Atomic Energy and Alternative Energy&quot;), according to its mission statement.

After a referendum against the production of atomic energy in Italy (following the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster in 1986) passed in 1987, in 1991 ENEA&#x27;s mission statement was changed and, consequently, its complete name, which became &quot;Ente per le nuove tecnologie, l&#x27;energia e l’ambiente&quot; (&quot;Agency for new technologies, energy and environment&quot;).

In January 1999 a new charter readdressed the goals for the agency as follows:
* To undertake initiatives aimed at developing, enhancing and promoting research and innovation, in keeping with Italy&#x27;s EU and international commitments in terms of energy efficiency, environmental protection and technological innovation.
* To support the implementation of high-tech production processes, especially by promoting demand for research and technology oriented towards enhancing sustainable development.
* To promote the transfer of technology and developments in the fields of energy efficiency and environmental protection to public administrations and businesses, in keeping with national and EU guidelines.
* To provide, upon request, specialist technical and organisational support to administrations promoting public initiatives at the international, national, regional and local levels, in all the sectors falling within ENEA&#x27;s purview.

In July 2009 the Italian parliament passed a law readdressing ENEA&#x27;s mission statement, including to back atomic energy, and contextually changing its complete name to the current one.

After Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 a second referendum against atomic energy production was held, and passed again. As the role of ENEA became contradictory to the referendum outcome, it was restructured once again in July 2015 and its mission statement was readdressed in order to be more coherent with the Italian energy policy.

In the nuclear sector ENEA participates in the development of the ITER fusion reactor to produce clean energy.

==Research centers==

Besides the headquarters in Rome, ENEA has the following research centers and laboratories in Italy:

* Bologna Research Center 
* Brasimone Research Center (near Bologna)
* Brindisi Research Center 
* Casaccia Research Center (Roma) 
* Faenza Research Laboratory
* Frascati Research Center 
* Ispra Research Laboratory
* Portici Research Center 
* Santa Teresa Research Center (Pozzuolo di Lerici, near La Spezia)

<text>Enea AB is an information technology company with its headquarters in Kista, Sweden that provides real-time operating systems and consulting services. Enea, which is an abbreviation of &quot;Engmans Elektronik Aktiebolag&quot;, also produces the OSE operating system.

==History==
Enea was founded 1968 by Rune Engman as Engmans Elektronik AB. Their first product was an operating system for a defence computer used by the Swedish Air Force. During the 1970s the firm developed compiler technology for the Simula programming language.

During the early days of the European Internet-like connections, Enea employee Björn Eriksen connected Sweden to EUnet using UUCP, and registered &quot;enea&quot; as the first Swedish domain in April 1983. The domain was later converted to the internet domain &quot;enea.se&quot; when the network was switched over to TCP and the Swedish top domain .se was created in 1986.

==Products==
===OSE===

The ENEA OSE real-time operating system first released in 1985.

The Enea multi core family of real-time operating systems was first released in 2009.

The Enea Operating System Embedded (OSE) is a family of real-time, microkernel, embedded operating system created by Bengt Eliasson for ENEA AB, which at the time was collaborating with Ericsson to develop a multi-core system using Assembly, C, and C++. Enea OSE Multicore Edition is based on the same microkernel architecture. The kernel design that combines the advantages of both traditional asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP). Enea OSE Multicore Edition offers both AMP and SMP processing in a hybrid architecture. OSE supports many processors, mainly 32-bit. These include the ColdFire, ARM, PowerPC, and MIPS based system on a chip (SoC) devices.

The Enea OSE family features three OSs: &quot;OSE&quot; (also named &quot;OSE Delta&quot;) for processors by ARM, PowerPC, and MIPS, &quot;OSEck&quot; for various DSP&#x27;s, and &quot;OSE Epsilon&quot; for minimal devices, written in pure assembly (ARM, ColdFire, C166, M16C, 8051). OSE is a closed-source proprietarily licensed software released on 20 March 2018. OSE uses events (or &quot;signals&quot;) in the form of messages passed to and from processes in the system. Messages are stored in a queue attached to each process. A &quot;link handler&quot; mechanism allows signals to be passed between processes on separate machines, over a variety of transports. The OSE signalling mechanism formed the basis of an open-source inter-process kernel design project named LINX.

===Linux===
Enea Linux provides an open, cross-development tool chain and runtime environment based on the Yocto Project embedded Linux configuration system.

===Hypervisor===
Enea Hypervisor is also based on OSE microkernel technology and runs Enea OSE applications and takes as guests Linux Operating System and optionally semiconductor specific executive environments for bare-metal speed packet processing

===Optima===
Enea Optima development tool suite for developing, debugging, and profiling embedded systems software

===The Element===
The Element middleware software for high-availability systems, based on technology developed by Equipe Communications Corp

==Collaborative project and community memberships==
Enea is a member of various collaborative projects and open source communities:
* Linux Foundation
** Automotive Grade Linux
** Linux OPNFV
** Yocto Project
* Linaro
* Open Data Plane (ODP)

<text>Legends car racing is a style of auto racing designed primarily to promote exciting racing and to keep costs down (as of 2022, a brand-new Legends car could be purchased in the USA for $17,500 USD). The race car bodyshells are 5/8-scale replicas of American automobiles from the 1930s and 1940s, powered by Yamaha XJ1250, FJ1200 (both air-cooled) or, starting in 2018, FZ-09 (water-cooled) engines. The worldwide sanctioning body for legends car racing is INEX.

Legends cars are a &quot;spec&quot; series, meaning all cars are mechanically identical, with the exception of three styles of car (standard coupe, &#x27;34 coupe, and sedan) available with 10 types of body styles. New cars are currently offered with seven body styles, however many used cars exist with the &quot;older&quot; styles.

They are raced on dirt tracks, oval tracks, and road circuits.

==History==
In 1992, Charlotte Motor Speedway officials noticed a need for lower cost racing cars with little maintenance time and cost. They found such a car existed, in the guise of the motorcycle-engined dwarf car, a 5/8-scale, steel-bodied and fenderless 1935 Ford coupé, which was being manufactured by the Dwarf Car Company in Phoenix, Arizona. As the coupé concept was not exactly in line in what they were looking for, and deeming steel replacement bodywork too costly, they adapted the dwarf car concept to fit their needs, creating cars resembling those of the 1930s and 1940s which competed in the early NASCAR modified tour races. To this day, the primary difference between the two cars is the legends have fenders over the tires, whereas the dwarfs have no fenders. The first legends car was unveiled in April 1992 by track president and general manager Humpy Wheeler and road racer Elliott Forbes-Robinson. Legends cars are produced by US Legend Cars International (formerly 600 Racing, Inc.) in Harrisburg, North Carolina. They are the largest mass-producer of race cars in the world.

==Legends car racing around the world==
Although the cars originated from the US, other countries including Canada and many European countries also host championships. Each November, the world finals are held in the US, with the exception of 2017, when the finals were held in Finland, at the Botniaring Racing Circuit.

===United States===
Drivers can be classified into four different divisions. The Pro Division is for the experienced drivers. The Masters Division features drivers 40 years and older. The Semi-Pro Division is for drivers with less than two years of experience in a legends, featuring the drivers that are new to the INEX legends car or have been inactive in other forms of racing for a while. There is also the Young Lions Division, which is designated for drivers between the ages of 12 and 16. There are separate nationals for dirt and asphalt cars.

Legends car drivers who have raced in NASCAR include Brennan Poole, Chris Buescher, Ryan Blaney, Reed Sorenson, David Ragan, Joey Logano, Kyle Busch, and Kurt Busch.

===United Kingdom===

Running since the late 1990s, Legends Racing UK visits tracks all over the country, and ran a 15-round championship, all brought to the UK by music promoter Phil Cooper.

Three races are held – two heats and a final – at a round of the championship, with the heats lasting between 7 and 12 laps depending on the circuit, with the final a few laps longer. The grid for race one is drawn by lots, with the reverse for heat two, and in the final the grid is formed by the reverse of the drivers points in the previous two races – meaning the most successful driver starts near the back. In each race however, all rookies start at the back of the grid.

In 2018, Team 247, a race team set up by engineering firm 24hr Solutions, with rookie driver Phil Turner (Hertfordshire), entered the competition in support of Help for Heroes. With racing and event dates across the country, the Team 247 brand was built on the legends racing platform.

Historically, legends racers from the UK have performed well at the world finals, winning Semi-pro (Glenn Burtenshaw), Pro (John Jon Higgins) and Masters divisions (Peter Morton).

====Scotland====

Brought to Scotland by Aly Hunter, and with only six cars taking to the grid in April 2000 at Knockhill, it is now the norm to find around 20 cars taking part, with 25 competing in the support races at the 2007 BTCC meeting. All the races in 2007 took place at Knockhill, but the series has organised &quot;away&quot; rounds at Croft, Oulton Park, Donington Park, Cadwell Park and Anglesey in recent years. The series observes the same race format rules as the UK legends, however the races are 8 and 10 laps long for the heats and finals respectively.

Legends are available for race or track hire at Knockhill.

===Northern Europe===
Legends have been racing in Finland since 1999 and the Legends Trophy series have existed since 2000. The first cars came to Finland from defunct Swedish series. Since then, over 60 cars have been imported to Finland. Legends is currently the most popular racing class in Finland with over 40 cars in the grid regularly. In 2010 Seinäjoen Vauhtiajot street racing event saw the record breaking 54 legends cars in the entry list.

The most successful racer in Finland is Pasi Matintupa, who won the trophy three times, in 2005–2007. In 2007 Rory Penttinen won the legends car world finals at Infineon Raceway in the pro class.

There is also an ice racing series for legends cars in Finland. Earlier legends have been raced in rallycross and rally sprinting.

Legends Cars Baltic racing run a FIA Northern European Zone championship consisting of racers from Finland, Sweden, Russia and Baltics. In 2016, the series was won by Marko Kilpiä. More than 50 racers participated in three events. Series will continue in 2017 with round in Riga, Parnu and Ahvenisto.

===Western Europe===

Legends have been raced in France since 2004. and have supported the French Grand Prix at Magny Cours; also in Belgium and Spain.

In Italy more than 80 legends cars have been sold, and the official Italian championship counts up to 30 drivers per event. The Italian team regularly takes part in the world finals, winning the Semi-pro Legends Road Course World Final in 2019 with the driver Kevin Liguori.

The Italian former World Cup Alpine ski racer Kristian Ghedina took part in the 2021 Legend Cars Italian Championship.

Since 2020, there has been a Legends Car Ice Challenge which is held in various Italian famous ski resorts during the winter season

===Mexico===
A legends racing series has been announced in Mexico for 2009, consolidating a true ladder system for the NASCAR Corona Series. The series is open for drivers 12 years and older, and is marketed as being the step before the NASCAR Mexico T4 Series.

===Georgia===

In 2012, a legends national championship started in the Republic of Georgia at the rebuilt Rustavi International Motorpark, 10 km from the country&#x27;s capital of Tbilisi. The 2012 season consisted of eight races for the championship of Georgia and one international race where 18 drivers from Georgia, Russia, Belarus and Germany took part. For the 2015 season, seven races are scheduled from April until November.

===Australia===

For a number of years legends raced on Australian oval tracks, surviving as a minor category, as the popularity of oval track racing &quot;down under&quot; is not what it is in the United States. Legends cars have been popular is a speedway category racing on dirt and clay ovals running on midget and sprint car meets, but also briefly became a tarmac category, racing as a support category with the Australian NASCAR series, mainly racing on the Calder Park Thunderdome superspeedway (something that the Legends Cars do not race, as they typically are on smaller ovals and road courses).

Phil Ward, a former touring car racer, recognized the potential for this type of economical racer, and developed the Aussie racing car, with a focus on road racing. The Aussie racing cars retain the same Yamaha motorcycle engines. The classic legends style bodyshape of old Fords and early Holdens have been gradually supplanted by imitations of modern road cars for commercial purposes. The category has visited many of the major Supercars Championship races across Australia. While high grid numbers have long been a feature of the class, calendars have fluctuated wildly as category management has clashed with event promoters. Another very similar category Future Racers also emerged during the 2000s technically very similar although the bodywork was more sportscar in nature.

In recent years, the international Legends category has re-emerged as a grassroots tarmac racing category on road courses, sanctioned by the Australian Auto Sport Alliance rather than the FIA-affiliated Motorsport Australia.

==Legends Big Money 100 at Charlotte==

On January 22, 2010, it was announced that US Legend Cars International would host a million dollar purse race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, from July 15–17, 2010. Three hundred one legends cars were on hand for the inaugural &quot;Legends Million&quot; event. The event was televised live on Speed Channel with Daniel Hemric of Kannapolis, North Carolina, taking the top prize of $250,000.

The event was hosted again at Charlotte Motor Speedway under the name of the &quot;Legends Big Money 100&quot; from 1st-2nd August 2011. The winner was Kyle Plott of Marietta, Georgia. He held off NASCAR driver David Ragan, a past legends car and bandolero champion, to win the 100-lap race at Charlotte.

The third annual Big Money 100 was once again hosted at Charlotte Motor Speedway on 4th July 2012. Tyler Green won the 100-lap feature.

The cars have very tight specifications to ensure cars are quite similar with each other. All cars utilise the same parts, engine and tyres. The only adjustable areas on the cars are: camber angle, caster angle, ride height, tyre pressure, spring rates, wheelbase, and gearing. All of these adjustments are also strictly regulated in the INEX rule book. The overall similarity in the cars ensures good racing, at a low cost. It also puts the race in the hands of the driver and the setup of the race car, instead of being about who can spend the most money.

<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Nautical Almanac Office (HMNAO), now part of the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, was established in 1832 on the site of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich (ROG), where &quot;The Nautical Almanac&quot; had been published since 1767. HMNAO produces astronomical data for a wide range of users, such as astronomers, mariners, aviators, surveyors, the military, police, lawyers, religious groups, architects, schools, diary and calendar manufacturers, photographers and film crews.

In 1937, it became part of ROG and moved with it, when it moved away from Greenwich (and was renamed the Royal Greenwich Observatory) first to Herstmonceux Castle, near Hailsham in East Sussex in 1948, then to Cambridge in 1990. When the RGO closed in 1998 HMNAO was transferred to the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, near Abingdon in Oxfordshire. In December 2006, HMNAO was transferred to the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, which is based in Taunton in Somerset.

==Leaders of HMNAO==
===Superintendents of the Nautical Almanac===
*Thomas Young (1818–1829) physicist and polymath

<text>Krypto, also known as Krypto the Superdog, is a superhero dog appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the character Superman. In most continuities, Krypto is Superman&#x27;s pet dog, usually depicted as a white dog of a generic pedigree.

Krypto has appeared in numerous television series and films, such as an eponymous animated series; the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, the live-action HBO Max series &quot;Titans&quot;, the animated film &quot;DC League of Super-Pets&quot; (2022), voiced by Dwayne Johnson and the fourth season and series finale of &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;. The character will make his live-action cinematic debut in the upcoming film &quot;Superman&quot; (2025), an installment of the DC Universe (DCU) media franchise.

==Publication history==
Krypto&#x27;s first appearance was in a Superboy adventure story in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #210 (March 1955), and was created by writer Otto Binder and artists Curt Swan. Originally intended as a one-off character, the dog attracted positive attention from the audience, and returned four issues later and became a regular member of Superboy&#x27;s cast.

==Character biography==
===The original Krypto===
On Krypton, parallel evolution leads to the emergence of analogous species to Earth birds, dogs, cats, and simians. They are domestic companion animals as they are on Earth. As explained in his first appearance, Krypto is originally the young dog and household pet of toddler Kal-El while they are on Krypton.

Jor-El, testing prototypes for the rocket that will eventually send Kal-El to Earth, decides to use Krypto as a test subject, with the dog launched in extended cryogenic sleep. However, Krypto&#x27;s rocket is knocked off-course by meteors and drifts through space for approximately ten Earth years until it eventually lands on Earth, where Krypto is reunited with the by-then teenaged superhero, Superboy. Due to the environment (Earth&#x27;s yellow sun and lower gravity), Krypto possesses the same powers and abilities as his master, although his physical abilities are proportionate to his smaller size and species. Certain sensory abilities of Krypto&#x27;s (senses of smell and hearing) are more acute than those of Superman, just as an ordinary dog&#x27;s senses are more acute than those of an ordinary human. Krypto also has human-level intelligence, with his thoughts being represented via speech balloons. Although he has normal canine instincts he is able to make decisions rationally and suppress his instincts to achieve Kal-El&#x27;s objectives, such as preserving his secret identity. Upon being reunited with Kal-El, the reawakened Krypto understands due to his sense of scent that the now-teenager is in fact Krypto&#x27;s own companion from Krypton now grown to adolescence.

Krypto is drawn as a medium-sized, short-haired white dog of generic pedigree. The early appearances of the character in the comics feature exaggerated anthropomorphic facial expressions; these are replaced in later appearances by a more generic canine face. When fighting crime, Krypto usually wears a gold collar, a miniature facsimile of the Superman&#x27;s symbol for a dog tag, and a dog-sized version of Superman&#x27;s cape. Whenever he is on Earth and wants to appear as an &quot;ordinary&quot; dog, Krypto pulls his collar and cape off, pulling it back on when necessary. In one story, he is gifted with a collar which contains a retractable cape that can be unfurled or hidden by pressing a stud.

When not accompanying Superboy/Superman, Krypto spends much of his time romping through space; while on Earth, however, he stays with the Kent family, posing as their pet dog, &quot;Skip&quot;. In that identity, his guardians apply a brown dye patch on his back for a disguise which Krypto burns off with his heat vision when he goes into costume; later, the Kents devise a pullcord-activated dye applicator and other methods which Krypto can use to switch to &quot;Skip&quot; and back without assistance.

Krypto is part of two organizations of super-animals: the 30th century Legion of Super-Pets, and the Space Canine Patrol Agents. After the 1971 revamp of Superman by editor Julius Schwartz, Krypto does not appear for several years. The character returns suffering from amnesia in a 1974 two-part Green Arrow backup story in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #440 and #441. His memory is restored in 1975&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; #287. Asked in a 2006 interview why he &quot;liberated Krypto from the limbo kennel&quot;, writer Elliot S. Maggin said, &quot;A man needs a dog. A superman needs a superdog.&quot;

Krypto had his own feature in &quot;The Superman Family&quot; #182 (March–April 1977) to #192 (November–December 1978), written by Bob Toomey.

In Alan Moore&#x27;s send-off to pre-Crisis Superman, &quot;&quot;, Krypto saves Superman by biting the throat out of the Kryptonite Man. Krypto is irradiated in the process and dies with the villain.

In &quot;Superboy&quot; #126 (Jan. 1966) &quot;Krypto&#x27;s Family Tree&quot;, Krypto&#x27;s father&#x27;s name is given as Zypto, his grandfather as Nypto, and his great-grandfather as Vypto.

===The modern Krypto===

====Pocket universe Krypto====
Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity reboot, Superman&#x27;s history is extensively rewritten, initially eliminating Krypto and all other survivors of Krypton. The Time Trapper creates a pocket universe that replicates pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity and has a version of Krypto. While battling three Phantom Zone criminals, Krypto sacrifices his powers by giving Superboy gold kryptonite to depower them.

====Krypto and Bibbo====
The second modern Krypto is a small white pet dog, rescued, and later named by Bibbo Bibbowski. Originally, Bibbo wanted to name the dog &quot;Krypton&quot; after Superman&#x27;s home planet. However, the engraver of the dog tag intentionally drops the letter &quot;n&quot; to extort more money from Bibbo; an angry Bibbo refuses to comply and renames the dog &quot;Krypto.&quot; Soon after, the dog finds two young children who were trapped in a bomb shelter for a month following Superman&#x27;s fight with Doomsday. The children are badly malnourished and dehydrated, but it is learned that they survive and recover. This gives Superman the idea to explain Clark Kent&#x27;s long absence by staging a faked rescue from a similar predicament.

Krypto is later acquired by the modern Superboy; however, this version of Krypto is an ordinary Earth dog with no superpowers. The dog and Kon-El do not get along. For a time, Krypto&#x27;s friends are agent Rex Leech, Dubbilex, and reporter Tana Moon. Krypto becomes involved in many of Superboy&#x27;s adventures. The dog is eventually dropped from the series, remaining in Hawaii when Superboy returns to Project Cadmus. Superboy&#x27;s friends believe him to be missing and Krypto is left in the care of Hillary, a young neighbor that he likes. After &quot;Superboy&quot; #69 of that series, the dog goes to live at Cadmus. Along with a creature called Grokk the Living Gargoyle and a DNAlien named Angry Charlie, Krypto starts an uprising against the Agenda, an evil consortium which is influencing Cadmus at the time. After battling the DNAlien the Gene-gnome, Krypto is never seen again; his last appearance is in &quot;Superboy&quot; #74.

===The dog from Krypton===

The third and more familiar version of Krypto is introduced in the early 2000s Superman comics storyline &quot;Return to Krypton&quot;, as a dog from a false, idealized Krypton created as a trap by Brainiac 13. Superman is able to defeat the trap, and when he returns to Earth, Krypto follows him.

This new version of Krypto has all the physical abilities of his pre-Crisis predecessor, but with a normal canine intellect and instincts. This initially causes a great deal of trouble for his new master when, for instance, he would scratch at a door to indicate he wanted to go out and unintentionally gouged big chunks out of the door with his super strength, or inflicting grievous bodily harm when combating villains (since Krypto bites the way a regular canine would, only without being careful about his super strength). As a result, Krypto is for some time locked away in the Fortress of Solitude under the care of one of Superman&#x27;s robots. This robot is programmed to emit the scent of the dog&#x27;s real master. Superman has gone to great lengths to train the dog, and he now occasionally accompanies the Man of Steel on missions. Batman never misses an opportunity to poke fun at Krypto when Batman and Superman don&#x27;t see eye-to-eye.

Krypto operates on his own for a short period of time, helping out when disasters rocked the planet because of the plans of the invading Imperiex. He is shown rescuing endangered people.

In the &quot;&quot; story arc, Batman uses Krypto to find Poison Ivy after she uses kryptonite to control Superman. It also appears that Krypto has taken a great liking to Catwoman, to her displeasure.

Krypto is part of the rescue force put together late in the &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; storyline &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (#1-6). Thinking Batman and Superman needed to be rescued from President Lex Luthor, a small team of superheroes, which includes such heroes as Superboy, Nightwing, and Robin, invade the White House. Krypto destroys part of the upper floors while subduing some Secret Service agents.

Krypto has a surprisingly violent reaction to Kara Zor-El when he first encounters her. The dog happens upon the girl while she was exploring the Fortress of Solitude and attacks, going so far as to use his heat vision and other potentially lethal attacks. Batman, who distrusted Kara at that time, pointed this out as an argument that Kara might not be who she says she is when he remarks &quot;Doesn&#x27;t it bother you at all that the dog hates her?&quot; Superman&#x27;s response was &quot;It&#x27;s his job to protect the fortress while he&#x27;s here. Besides...the dog hates everybody.&quot;

Some time later, Superman left Krypto in the care of Superboy, saying that Smallville&#x27;s open spaces were a better place for the dog, and that Superboy could use a friend (as shown in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; vol. 3, #7). Their relationship had a shaky start, not helped by Krypto getting Superboy in trouble with Starfire for destroying her garden.

However, they have slowly developed a close friendship, in which Krypto willingly does anything he can to protect Conner. One example of this loyalty was Krypto&#x27;s quick defense of Conner from an enraged Superboy-Prime. He bit Superboy-Prime in the shoulder. Although Krypto was injured with a punch sending him bouncing down the main street of Smallville, this only strengthened his relationship with Conner. Unfortunately Superboy perishes in battle while destroying a multiverse influence tower that Superboy-Prime helped build.

Krypto makes a brief appearance in &quot;JLA&quot; #87, where Martian Manhunter mind-controls him after his evil Fernus persona resurfaces.

Later, he is mentally influenced by an alien armada led by Despero. This is seen in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #32 (March 2007). Along with other Earth-based heroes influenced by alien origins, Krypto attacks Superman and Batman after a gathering in Metropolis. The two titular heroes neutralize the alien threat, freeing the minds of everyone affected.

====One year later====
&quot;Action Comics&quot; #850 presents the latest revision of Superman&#x27;s origin, containing many subtle retcons to &quot;&quot;, the latest major revision of Superman&#x27;s continuity. The current version indicates that Krypto was indeed the El family dog from the real Krypton (as in the Silver Age), showing an identical white dog present at Kal-El&#x27;s birth. Although &quot;Action&quot; #850 does not deal with the specifics of how or when this dog was sent to Earth, subsequent issues of the &quot;Superman&quot; title have contained references to Krypto being around when he was &quot;young&quot;. Both inclusions retconned the origin of the current Krypto hailing from an ersatz Krypton and debuting during Superman&#x27;s adulthood.

Some time later, a back-up feature in &quot;Action Comics&quot; Annual #11, written by Geoff Johns, finally clarified the details of the &quot;New Earth&quot; origin of Krypto: &quot;The Kryptonian canine of the House of El, Krypto was sent in a small prototype rocket created by Jor-El. Lost for years, Krypto was eventually found and rescued by Clark when he was a boy.&quot; This retcon brings the modern Krypto almost identically in line with the original Silver Age version.

Krypto goes missing for over a year following the death of his previous owner Conner Kent, but Superman is unable to devote much time to search for him, having himself been without powers for much of that time. Krypto responds to the call from Jimmy Olsen&#x27;s makeshift signal watch and makes his return. Krypto is quick to defend Jimmy who, along with Superman, falls under attack and is badly injured as a result. Jimmy takes Krypto back to his apartment, and nurses the injured dog back to health. Superman later decides to let Krypto stay with Jimmy when he realizes that Krypto has always preferred the company of younger people, such as himself as a child and Kon-El. Jimmy gives Krypto the secret identity of &quot;Pal&quot;, a play on &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot;.

====Calmer====
During the Green Lantern storyline &quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot;, Robin enlists Krypto&#x27;s aid in battling Superboy-Prime, who has returned to Earth as part of the Sinestro Corps. Under Robin&#x27;s command, Krypto attacks Prime with feral rage, damaging his armor, but is unfortunately beaten aside, although he buys the heroes enough time for Superman, Power Girl, and Supergirl to join the fight.

During Superman&#x27;s battle with the villain Atlas, and after Atlas incapacitates such heroes as Steel and Bibbo Bibbowski, Atlas laments that he has not faced a worthy opponent. Just then, Krypto emerges vowing to &quot;hurt this one&quot; because he &quot;loves man&quot; (Superman). Krypto proves to be more than a match for Atlas, revealing Atlas&#x27; magical nature to Superman. This is the first and only story to show exactly what Krypto &#x27;thinks&#x27;, and although it is translated for readers, Krypto &#x27;speaks&#x27; in a simplistic manner with broken English, rarely using pronouns. This story also focuses on how Superman has taught Krypto to be much calmer and well-behaved; Superman reassures Lois that Krypto loves her as well. Following the death of Jonathan Kent and Brainiac&#x27;s attack on the family farm, Krypto arrives on the front step of the Kent Farm, to protect Martha Kent and provide companionship. A clone of Krypto made by Cadmus made an appearance in &quot;Power Girl&quot;.

Geoff Johns detailed Krypto&#x27;s role in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;. The character appears alongside the resurrected Conner Kent as his companion and sidekick, with a much more amicable relationship than before Connor&#x27;s death.

Krypto is instrumental in helping Conner Kent escape the effects of a Black Lantern power ring. He later participates in the final battle against the Black Lantern Corps. The canine is again seen living calmly on the Kent farm, sitting next to Martha.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In September 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Krypto appears as a normal dog with no powers on Krypton. There is mention of a white dog ghost that is protecting Clark Kent. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #5 (March 2012), during Krypton&#x27;s final moments, Jor-El tries to save his family by opening a portal to the Phantom Zone, when suddenly the incarcerated try to escape. Krypto bravely defends the family but is sucked into the Zone, while baby Kal-El shows anguish at losing the dog.

The now-grown Superman rediscovers Krypto in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #13 (December 2012) after being pulled into the Phantom Zone by the first inhabitant of the prison. At the story&#x27;s conclusion, Superman is able to bring Krypto back to Earth. With Krypto in critical condition, Superman rushes to the observation deck, exposing Krypto to the sun&#x27;s radiation. Krypto is then healed at an accelerated rate and is comforted by him. The rapid healing reveals that the dog has developed superpowers just as Kal-El, Kon-El and Kara Zor-El have.

In &quot;Superboy&quot; #24, Krypto is shown battling polar bears in the Arctic before deciding to join Superboy and Doctor Psycho in battling H.I.V.E. Superboy is knocked out by Psycho-Pirate, with Krypto by his side.

Later, the threat of Warworld looms high above the Earth. Batman and Superman are blackmailed into recruiting members of their &#x27;clan&#x27; and Krypto shows up. He is shown whining after the mention of Superboy, who is suspected of being dead. Krypto assists Superman and Supergirl in fighting various groups of Warworld challengers, as a delaying tactic to save Earth from destruction. Thanks to the secretive efforts of Steel and Batgirl, no innocents are hurt.

Superman becomes sick and voluntarily imprisons himself. Batman recruits Krypto on a mission to the Phantom Zone in an attempt to find a cure; instead they find something extremely dangerous.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Superman&#x27;s previous history prior to &quot;The New 52&quot; is restored. Krypto is seen in the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; continuity, as the family dog of Superman, Lois and their son Jon. His collar is made out of the belt of an old Superman uniform from the Fortress of Solitude, as a present from Jon.

Krypto is later seen as a loyal companion to Supergirl.

The Super-Sons annual of 2017 explores Krypto&#x27;s friendship with various super-animals, such as Titus, Batcow, Streaky, and Detective Chimp.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
In his original Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; incarnation, Krypto possessed the same powers and abilities as an adult Kryptonian, although his physical abilities were proportionate to his smaller size and species. Certain sensory abilities of Krypto&#x27;s (senses of smell and hearing) were more acute than those of Superman, just as an ordinary dog&#x27;s senses would be more acute than those of a normal human. He also had super-canine intelligence (approximately human level, though with his canine traits and interests still present); the comics expressed this via the use of thought balloons indicating what Krypto was thinking.

In his current incarnation, Krypto&#x27;s abilities are essentially identical; however, he possesses normal canine intelligence, though as shown in the storyline with Atlas, Krypto does seem to have a general understanding of speech, and can take initiatives of his own, such as vowing to protect Metropolis from Atlas because of his knowledge of the fact that Superman himself protects and cares for the city, as well as vowing to hurt Atlas for hurting Superman.

In &quot;DC League of Super-Pets&quot;, Krypto gains a new powerful move called the solar paw punch. He absorbs the sun&#x27;s solar energy, and then strikes his opponent down with one solar-powered strike. However, the move also proves to be fatal, because once used, the solar paw Punch not only destroys the villain, but also destroys the hero that uses it. Krypto resorted to using this move to stop Lulu, but survived after being shielded by Ace.

<text>Royal Air Force Akrotiri, commonly abbreviated RAF Akrotiri (; ) is a large Royal Air Force (RAF) military airbase on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. It is located in the Western Sovereign Base Area, one of two areas which comprise Akrotiri and Dhekelia, a British Overseas Territory, administered as a Sovereign Base Area.

The station commander has a dual role, and is also the officer commanding the Akrotiri or Western Sovereign Base Area, reporting to the commander of British Forces Cyprus (BFC) who is also the Administrator.

==History==
RAF Akrotiri was first constructed in the mid-1950s to relieve pressure on the main RAF station in the centre of the island, RAF Nicosia.

===Suez Crisis===

In late 1956, relations between the United Kingdom and Egypt had reached a crisis. The Suez Crisis saw a further increase in the strength of RAF forces in Cyprus. Akrotiri was mainly an airfield for fighter, photo reconnaissance, and ground attack aircraft. Its regular squadrons of Gloster Meteor night fighters, English Electric Canberra photo reconnaissance aircraft, and de Havilland Venom ground attack machines were reinforced by further Canberras which were ready for action if Egypt attacked Israel.

===1960s===
After the Suez Crisis, the main emphasis of life on the airfield shifted to helping fight the EOKA revolt, and training missions. After the withdrawal from both Egypt and Iraq, and Suez Crisis, it was clear that a command centred on Cyprus could not control units stationed in the Arabian Peninsula, of which there were still many. Consequently, the Middle East Command was split; with that east of Suez being controlled from Aden, Yemen, and the remainder being renamed the Near East Command, controlled from Cyprus. From 1957 to 1969, four squadrons operating the Canberra (No. 6 Squadron, No. 32 Squadron, No. 73 Squadron, and No. 249 Squadron) provided first a conventional and then from November 1961, a nuclear striking capability as part of the Baghdad Pact, later the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO).

Akrotiri, along with Nicosia, assumed a very important status, as virtually the sole means for projecting British airpower into the eastern Mediterranean, outside of aircraft carriers. In 1960, independence was granted to Cyprus, with the RAF maintaining both RAF Nicosia and RAF Akrotiri as airfields, controlled by the Near East Air Force (NEAF). However, Akrotiri assumed more importance as Nicosia was used for greater civil aviation traffic. After 1966, it was no longer possible to maintain RAF units at Nicosia due to pressures of space, and Akrotiri became the only RAF flying station left on the island.

===1970s===
In August 1970, detachment &#x27;G&#x27; of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) arrived at the airfield with Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft to monitor the Egypt / Israel Suez Canal fighting and cease-fire. Permanent monitoring of the Middle East Ceasefire was undertaken by the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, known as Operation &#x27;OLIVE HARVEST&#x27;.

Up until 1974, RAF Akrotiri had a balanced force of aircraft assigned to it, including No. 9 Squadron and No. 35 Squadron, both flying Avro Vulcan strategic bombers. The Vulcans provided a bomber force for CENTO, one of the three main anti-Communist mutual defence pacts signed in the early days of the Cold War. However, during that year, Turkish forces invaded Cyprus in connection with a Greek-sponsored coup. The UK then evacuated most of the RAF from Akrotiri as the CENTO treaty had degenerated to the point of uselessness. The two Vulcan squadrons left for UK stations in 1975. What was left at the airfield was the flying unit that is permanently assigned to the station to this day; No. 84 Squadron, a helicopter search and rescue unit. In addition, the role of No. 34 Squadron RAF Regiment provided support.

In September 1976, the US U-2 operations were reassigned to the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (9th SRW), but the U-2 operation at RAF Akrotiri continued to be called Operating Location (OLIVE HARVEST) OH until September 1980. Thereafter, it became Detachment 3 of the 9th SRW, although the name OLIVE HARVEST continues. Two U-2s are stationed at RAF Akrotiri, and they are still monitoring the ceasefire agreement between the Egypt and Israel, although the present operations in the US Central Command area requires further missions. U-2s also transit through RAF Akrotiri either on going into the Central Command theatre, or returning to Beale AFB, California.
===1980s===
Due to the station&#x27;s relative proximity to the Middle East, it was used for the reception of American casualties after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.

Between April 1983 and September 1984, RAF Boeing Chinook helicopters deployed to Akrotiri in support of British United Nations forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL).

In the mid-1980s, the US launched retaliatory attacks against Libya after the country&#x27;s leader, Muammar al-Gaddafi, was implicated in the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque. Although the bombing operations were staged out of the UK, Akrotiri was employed in the role of an alternate in case of emergency, and was used as such by at least one aircraft. This led to retaliatory action against the British base.

===2000s–2010s===

In July 2006, RAF Akrotiri played a major role as a transit point for personnel evacuations out of Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War (see international reactions to the 2006 Lebanon War and Joint Task Force Lebanon).

Akrotiri was the location of the main transmitter of the well known numbers station, the Lincolnshire Poacher, although transmissions ceased in 2008.

In March 2011, the station was used as a staging base for support aircraft involved in Operation Ellamy, the UK&#x27;s contribution to the NATO-led military intervention in Libya. Tanker support and logistical units were based here to support aerial operations over the country.

In August 2013, six RAF Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft were deployed to Akrotiri to defend the base, &quot;to ensure the protection of UK interests and the defence of our sovereign base areas at a time of heightened tension in the wider region&quot;. Earlier, two RAF TriStar aerial refuelling aircraft and a Sentry AEW1 had been deployed to Akrotiri.

The station hosted the main hospital for British Forces Cyprus, The Princess Mary&#x27;s Hospital (TPMH), located on Cape Zevgari. This closed in October 2012, and cases too serious to be dealt with at the base health clinic are sent to the private Ygia Polyclinic in Limassol.

In August 2014, six RAF Panavia Tornado fighter-bombers were deployed to Akrotiri to carry out reconnaissance missions over Iraq, following the rise of Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria. On 26 September 2014, Members of Parliament voted in favour of the RAF carrying out air strikes on ISIS in Iraq, and on 27 September the first two Tornado jets took off from Akrotiri loaded with laser-guided bombs and missiles. On 30 September 2014, two British Tornados successfully intercepted and attacked ISIS targets of a heavily armed truck, at the request of Iraqi Kurdish fighters.

The station was used to support the 2018 missile strikes against Syria.

In June 2019, the station launched the RAF&#x27;s first F-35 Lightning II operational sortie. Six aircraft were deployed to take part in operations against Islamic State.


===2020s===
Flight logs indicated that UK military transport aircraft made numerous flights from Akrotiri to Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport during the Israel-Hamas war. The reasons for the flights were unknown.

Four Typhoons based in Akrotiri struck Houthi targets in Yemen on 12 January 2024.

The RAF reportedly assisted Israel during the April 2024 Iranian strikes on Israeli territory from jets that had taken of from RAF Akrotiri and were flying over Iraq.

During 2024, protesters demonstrated outside the base against the UK and US&#x27; use of the base to support Israel in its military actions in Gaza and Lebanon.

==Controversies==
===Radar===
In 2007, a large over-the-horizon radar antenna was erected within the base. Several demonstrations and protests took place, with the most memorable incident being the act of MP (MEP since 2004) Marios Matsakis chaining himself to the antenna. Matsakis stated &quot;It is outrageous that in the 21st century there are Cypriot villages living under British military rule, neither under their own government&#x27;s jurisdiction nor under the protection of the EU treaties&quot;.

===United States surveillance flights===
In 2010, U-2s from the United States Air Force&#x27;s 9th Reconnaissance Wing were used in Operation Cedar Sweep to fly surveillance over Lebanon, relaying information about Hezbollah militants to Lebanese authorities, and in Operation Highland Warrior to fly surveillance over Turkey and northern Iraq to relay information to Turkish authorities. These flights were the topic of acrimonious leaked diplomatic cables between British officials and the American embassy, with David Miliband saying that &quot;policymakers needed to get control of the military&quot;. The British were concerned that the flights over Lebanon were authorised by the Lebanese Ministry of Defence, rather than the entire cabinet, and that the intelligence so gained could lead to the UK being complicit in the unlawful torture of detainees. After warnings that these issues &quot;could jeopardise future use of British territory&quot;, John Rood, a senior Bush administration official, and Mariot Leslie, the Foreign Office&#x27;s director general for defence and intelligence, became involved. Leslie said that the U.S. was not actually expected to check on detained terrorists, but that future spy missions would require full written applications.

<text>The National Fish Hatchery System (NFHS) was established by the U.S. Congress in 1871 through the creation of a U.S. Commissioner for Fish and Fisheries. This system of fish hatcheries is now administered by the Fisheries Program of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior.

== History ==

When early pioneers began migrating to the western United States, there were no catch limits on fish and no laws preventing people from modifying fish habitats to meet human needs for water, food, and safety. As settlement progressed, abundant fish populations began to decline. By 1870, growing concern for such declines prompted fishery studies, which spurred the establishment of fish spawning stations for collecting and hatching fish eggs and stocking small fish back into waters with declining fisheries. Many of these early spawning stations later became fish hatcheries, marking the beginning of the Fisheries Program and the NFHS.

President Ulysses S. Grant was chiefly responsible for the first official government action to conserve U.S. fishery resources for future generations. President Grant established the U.S. Fish Commission in 1871. The Commission was the forerunner of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Fisheries Program.

In 1872, the first federal fish hatchery, known as the Baird Hatchery, was established on the McCloud River in California. The NFHS has since grown into a large complex system devoted to conserving U.S. fishery resources.

Originally Spencer Fullerton Baird was chosen by President Ulysses S. Grant to manage the fisheries in the country. He was named &quot;Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries&quot;. In 1871 Baird took office but his work was still in effect. The people were now understanding the importance of the fisheries, for sport and food. With much pressure from such organizations as the American Fish Cultural Association and the American Fisheries Society, Congress reserved $15,000 for the fisheries.

The man that was chosen to essentially take Baird&#x27;s position was Livingston Stone. With a group of scientists, his job was to find salmon spawning areas and develop a salmon hatchery so that the eggs could be managed and shipped around the country to make the salmon available for all. Stone and his team located this area and started shipping eggs as soon as possible. A few miles from where they had originally found the salmon eggs, rainbow trout eggs were also found. Now rainbow trout eggs and salmon eggs were being shipped across the world. Essentially every rainbow trout&#x27;s native water is northern California. The Baird Hatchery was formed from Stone and today the hatchery still manages fish as they did back in the 1800s.

== The Fisheries Program ==

The Service&#x27;s Fisheries Program and its fish hatchery system have played a vital role in conserving America&#x27;s fishery resources for over 130 years. The program was established mainly to address the following:
* The growing concern over the observed decline in the United States&#x27; fishery resources;
* the lack of information concerning the status of the Nation&#x27;s fisheries; and
* the need to define and protect U.S. fishing rights.

The Fisheries Program has worked with valued partners including States, Native American tribes, Federal Agencies, other Service programs, and private interests in a larger effort to conserve fish and other aquatic resources.

== Responsibilities ==

The original purpose of the NFHS was to supplement declining native stocks of coastal and lake food fish through fish propagation. The NFHS has extensive experience culturing over 100 different aquatic species, and now propagates fish for reasons beyond supplementing declining food species. Hatchery-reared fish are now used to replace fish that were lost from natural events including drought, flood, habitat destruction, or human influences such as over-harvest, pollution, habitat loss due to development and dam construction. This is necessary in order to establish fish populations that meet specific management needs, and to provide for the creation of new and expanded recreational fisheries opportunities.

The role of the NFHS has changed significantly over the past 30 years as a result of the increasing demands recently placed upon various aquatic systems. Major responsibilities of the NFHS, besides mentioned fish propagation, now include helping to recover species listed under the Endangered Species Act, restoring native aquatic populations, mitigating for fisheries lost as a result of federal water projects, and providing fish to benefit Indian tribes and National Wildlife Refuges. NFHS concentrates its efforts on several fish species including lake trout, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, paddlefish, and sturgeon. Other interesting species that the NFHS helps to restore include freshwater mussels and amphibians.

== Conservation ==

The NFHS is able to conserve U.S. fishery resources by:
* preserving the genes of wild and hatchery-raised fish;
* restoring fish populations that have declined;
* protecting threatened and endangered fish and restoring them to their native waters;
* providing fish health services;
* providing Native American tribes with native and recreation fisheries;
* making up for the loss of fish as a result of Federal water projects, such as canals and dams; and
* serving as education, outreach, and research stations

== Achievements ==
Recently, the Service has maximized the output of its work force by integrating the work of fish hatcheries and fisheries management. This integrated effort has been successful, and has resulted in cohesive, more efficient national restoration programs, such as those for Great Lakes lake trout, Atlantic Coast striped bass, Atlantic salmon, and Pacific salmon. The Fisheries Program continues to work with its stakeholders — Federal agencies, state resource agencies, tribal governments, and private organizations — to complement habitat restoration and other resource management strategies for maintaining healthy ecosystems that support healthy fisheries.

Currently, the system comprises 70 national fish hatcheries, nine fish health centers, seven fish technology centers, and a historic national fish hatchery. National fish hatcheries are located in 35 states and produce more than 60 different species of fish.

<text>Brendan Grace (1 April 1951 – 11 July 2019) was an Irish comedian and singer. He portrayed the comedy schoolboy character &#x27;Bottler&#x27;, appeared in the 1995 film &quot;Moondance&quot;, and played Father Fintan Stack in the Irish TV sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;. His 1975 song &quot;The Combine Harvester&quot; was a number one hit in Ireland, as well as his cover of &quot;The Dutchman&quot; in 1982.

==Early life==
Born in the heart of Dublin in 1951, Grace was raised on Echlin Street, in the inner city Liberties neighbourhood. His father Seamus worked as a bartender, an ambulance man and other odd jobs to keep the family going. Like many young Dubliners of the time, Grace left school young to begin working. His first job was as a messenger boy, an occupation he often referred to in his live act.

==Music career==
At the age of 18, Grace formed a folk group band known as the Gingermen. During a gig one night, the band found themselves two members short; in an attempt to calm an anxious crowd, Grace was thrust upon the stage to humour them. His wit and observations of daily life in Ireland won over the crowd.

Grace&#x27;s hit songs included &quot;Cushie Butterfield&quot;, &quot;The Combine Harvester&quot;—which topped the charts in Ireland in 1975, and in 1976 was a UK number one hit for The Wurzels—and &quot;The Dutchman&quot;.

==Acting career==
In 1995, Grace starred in &quot;Moondance&quot;, and the following year he appeared in the &quot;Father Ted&quot; episode &quot;New Jack City&quot; as Father Fintan Stack. In 2007, he appeared as Big Sean in &quot;Killinaskully&quot;, and in 2015, he starred in &quot;The Gift&quot;.

He also reprised his Bottler character in a TV movie also called &quot;Bottler&quot; in November 2013. It tells of Bottler&#x27;s exploits in his early years.

==Personal life==
Grace married in 1973. They had four children, including Bradley Grace, a member of the American metalcore band Poison the Well.

In November 2009, Grace released his autobiography, &quot;Amuzing Grace&quot; (). In his later life, he divided his time between his home and his pub which he named Brendan Grace&#x27;s Bar.

Grace was diagnosed with pneumonia in June 2019, and died from lung cancer at the Galway Clinic in Galway, Ireland, on 11 July 2019, aged 68. His funeral took place on 15 July at the Church of St. Nicholas of Myra in Dublin, followed by cremation. The funeral was attended by thousands of fans who lined the streets outside the church as well as along the procession route, which included stops outside the Guinness brewery and Grace&#x27;s childhood home on Echlin Street. A year later his family scattered his ashes on Lough Derg near their family home in Killaloe, County Clare. A seat was also dedicated to the entertainer at his favourite spot in Killaloe where he used to feed the ducks and the swans.

<doc id="432797" wikidata="Q2167949" url="?curid=432797" title="Eyebrow piercing">
<text>An eyebrow piercing is a vertical surface piercing, wherein a twelve to eighteen gauge cannula needle is inserted through the bottom of the eyebrow and exits through the top of the eyebrow to permit insertion of jewelry. Those performing the piercing may use a Pennington clamp to better guide the needle through the skin. A curved barbell is the most common jewelry inserted post-piercing.

A piercing of underneath the eye is known as an anti-eyebrow piercing.
A horizontal piercing of the eyebrow is known as a horizontal eyebrow piercing.

==Jewelry==
Barbells, curved barbells and captive bead rings are the common jewelry types worn in eyebrow piercings. Each of these jewelry types put varying degrees of pressure on the piercing, which can cause irritation or piercing migration over time. The larger the gauge used in the piercing, the less likely the piercing is to be rejected or accidentally torn out. Sixteen gauge piercings and jewelry is common.

==Placement==
The placement of the eyebrow piercing varies according to the will of the one receiving the piercing. The area may be pierced anywhere along the eyebrow from directly above the eye, to the edge of the eyebrow by the temple. Care must be taken if the eyebrow is pierced further in than directly above the eye, because of the presence of supra-orbital nerves. Piercing the eyebrow is safe.

==Healing==

After the piercing is completed, the healing process takes a minimum of six weeks to eight weeks for the wound to close properly around the piercing, and it may be six months to a year before the jewelry can be removed for any length of time without the hole closing. It is common for an eyebrow piercing to produce a sticky white discharge or a crust around the jewelry during the healing process. Complications, when reported, are usually fixed with a short-term round of antibiotics. A light bruise is common, due to the high amount of capillaries in the eyebrow and the proximity to the surface of the skin. Sudden pain in the area of the piercing could be a potential sign of infection, and should be checked by a professional immediately.

==History and culture==
Body piercing has been performed in many cultures for millennia, usually as part of a rite of passage or to identify a person as courageous, strong, or worthy. Eyebrow piercing, however, has a short history. It was introduced by the punk subculture in the 1970s as a fashion statement. Eyebrow piercings were also commonly sported by members of nu metal and post-grunge bands of the mid-1990s and early 2000s, Jonathan Davis of Korn and Aaron Lewis of Staind both having pierced eyebrows.

<doc id="432801" wikidata="Q313199" url="?curid=432801" title="Ari Vatanen">
<text>Ari Pieti Uolevi Vatanen (; born 27 April 1952) is a Finnish rally driver turned politician and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1999 to 2009. He won the World Rally Championship drivers&#x27; title in 1981 and the Paris Dakar Rally four times. In addition, he won the 1997 FIA World Cup for Cross-Country Rallies.

==Racing career==
Vatanen&#x27;s debut year in rallying was 1970, and he debuted in the World Rally Championship at the 1974 1000 Lakes Rally. In that year he won the Nortti Rally in an Opel Ascona, beating Hannu Mikkola in the process, which brought him to wider attention. His first international rally was the 1975 Rothmans 747 Rally in Jamaica driving a Datsun 120Y. He placed 12th with co-driver Gerry Phillips. At the end of that season he was offered his first professional drive, in a Ford Escort RS1800, on the RAC Rally. He crashed out on the second day, but by then he had impressed Ford team manager Stuart Turner enough to be offered a seat in the team for the British Rally Championship the following year.

In the 1976 Scottish Rally (part of the British Rally Championship), the Ford works team replaced a broken differential in Ari Vatanen&#x27;s Mk2 Escort RS 1800 with one they removed from a spectator&#x27;s Ford Capri. Vatanen did not finish the Scottish Rally, but he won the championship, a feat he repeated in 1980, co-driven by David Richards, who later became chairman of Prodrive. Between 1977 and 1980, Vatanen also competed in selected World Championship events, initially for the official Ford team and then, after its withdrawal from the sport at the end of 1979, for the semi-private Rothmans Rally Team. He took his debut win at the 1980 Acropolis Rally and became the World Rally Champion in 1981.

Vatanen and Richards parted ways for the 1982 season, and for the next few years Vatanen was co-driven by Terry Harryman. He did not defend his world title in 1982, competing instead in the British Championship in a Ford Escort, before moving to the Opel team for 1983. The Opel Ascona and Opel Manta were only two-wheel-drive and not fully competitive, but Vatanen still won the Safari Rally.

In 1984, Vatanen signed to drive the Peugeot 205 T16 for Peugeot&#x27;s factory team. From the 1984 1000 Lakes Rally to 1985 Swedish Rally, Vatanen won five world rallies in a row. He was tipped to win the 1985 world title, but at mid-season was trailing his teammate Timo Salonen after a series of accidents and mechanical problems. He then had a serious accident on the Rally Argentina, when his car somersaulted at over . His seat broke, and he was thrown around inside the car, suffering severe injuries to his legs and torso and life-threatening internal bleeding. He spent 18 months recovering first from his physical injuries, and then from severe depression. He went on to make a complete recovery and his return to motorsport in 1987 saw him go on to win the Paris-Dakar Rally four times; with Peugeot in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and with Citroën in 1991. He became the centre of controversy when his car was stolen whilst leading the same rally in 1988.

In 1997 he won the FIA World Cup for Cross-Country Rallies with a Citroën ZX Rallye-raid alongside navigator Fred Gallagher (co-driver).
With Peugeot, Vatanen also won the Pikes Peak International Hillclimb, after Peugeot stopped participating in the World Rally Championship in 1986, due to the demise of Group B rallying. Peugeot used the lessons learnt from its 205 T16 to create the 405 T16. With at least , large aerofoils, four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering, Vatanen took the car up the hill in record time, his efforts being captured in the award-winning short film &quot;Climb Dance&quot;.

Vatanen continued competing in the World Rally Championship until the 1998 season. He drove for Mitsubishi Ralliart Europe in four events in 1989 and in five events in 1990. His best result with the Mitsubishi Galant VR-4 was second at the 1990 1000 Lakes Rally. From 1992 to 1993, he competed for Subaru in 11 events, finishing second three times, including on the debut event of the first Subaru Impreza in Finland. Vatanen briefly led the event before being overhauled by eventual winner Juha Kankkunen. Even so, he was dropped by the Subaru team at the end of the 1993 season in favour of Carlos Sainz.

The following year he returned to the wheel of a Ford, driving the Ford Escort RS Cosworth for a semi-private team, and then being co-opted into the Ford factory team where he stood in for the injured Francois Delecour. He scored a podium finish on Rally Argentina, the first time he had contested the event since his accident there nine years previously.

From 1995, Vatanen competed less frequently. He scored a podium finish at the 1998 Safari Rally, and then briefly returned to a works Subaru for the season-ending Rally of Great Britain, marking his 100th World Rally Championship event.

Vatanen joined Nissan in the Paris-Dakar in 2003, finishing seventh. He also made an appearance at the 2003 Rally Finland with a Bozian Racing-prepared Peugeot 206 WRC, finishing eleventh. In 2004 and 2005, he drove the Dakar for Nissan, and in 2007 he made another attempt with Volkswagen, but retired on the seventh stage after a fire destroyed his car.
In September 2008, Vatanen took part in the &quot;Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally&quot;, a round of the Scottish Rally Championship centred in Perth in Scotland. His co-driver was once again David Richards and they competed in the same Rothmans sponsored Ford Escort RS1800 that they drove in 1981. He was one of a number of ex-world champions to take part in the event in memory of McRae, who died in 2007.

==Personal life==
Vatanen was born and grew up in rural Tuupovaara in Eastern Finland. He is married to Rita and has four children, Kim &quot;(1972–2024)&quot;, Ria &quot;(b. 1980)&quot;, Tua &quot;(b. 1982)&quot; and Max &quot;(b. 1990)&quot;. They have homes in Finland and France. Kim was the manager of current WRC driver Sébastien Ogier. In 2016 Max followed his fathers footsteps by entering the British Rally Championship driving an M-Sport prepared Ford Fiesta R5.

In 1993, Vatanen settled in southern France, where he bought a farm and a winery.

Vatanen speaks fluent Finnish, English, and French.

==Political career==

In 1999, Vatanen was elected to the European Parliament from the list of the conservative Finnish National Coalition party although he continued to live in France. The issues on which he worked included car taxation, traffic policies, development aid and agricultural policy.

In 2004, he was re-elected, this time from the list of the conservative French Union for a Popular Movement. In the 2009 European Parliament elections Vatanen was again a National Coalition candidate in Finland, but he did not get elected this time.

In July 2009, Vatanen declared his interest in being a candidate to stand against Max Mosley in the FIA presidential elections in October if Mosley decide to stand for another term as president. Vatanen later confirmed that he would run for the presidency. On 23 October 2009, Vatanen failed in his bid to be elected as president of the FIA, which was won by his former team boss at Peugeot, subsequently Scuderia Ferrari manager Jean Todt.

Vatanen is a signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism.

<doc id="432815" wikidata="Q1048363" url="?curid=432815" title="Party of Five">
<text>Party of Five is an American teen and family drama television series created by Christopher Keyser and Amy Lippman that originally aired on Fox from September 12, 1994, to May 3, 2000, with a total of six seasons consisting of 142 episodes. The series featured an ensemble cast led by Scott Wolf as Bailey, Matthew Fox as Charlie, Neve Campbell as Julia, and Lacey Chabert as Claudia Salinger, who with their baby brother Owen (played by several actors) constitute five siblings whom the series follows after the loss of their parents in a car accident. Notable co-stars included Scott Grimes, Paula Devicq, Michael Goorjian, Ben Browder, Jeremy London, and Jennifer Love Hewitt. While categorized as a series aimed at teenagers and young adults, &quot;Party of Five&quot; explored several mature themes, including substance and domestic abuse, teen pregnancy, mental illness, cancer, and the long-term effects of parental loss.

Despite receiving positive reviews from television critics after its debut, including &quot;TV Guide&quot; naming it &quot;The Best Show You&#x27;re Not Watching&quot; in 1995, the series suffered from low ratings during its first and second seasons, during which speculation arose that it would soon be cancelled. In 1996, &quot;Party of Five&quot; won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama, after which ratings and popularity grew for the majority of the remainder of the series.

A spin-off, &quot;Time of Your Life&quot;, starring Hewitt, debuted on Fox on October 25, 1999, and was cancelled after one season and 19 episodes.

== Synopsis ==
The show, set in San Francisco, centered on the five Salinger siblings (the &quot;party of five&quot; of the show&#x27;s title), who become orphans after their parents are killed in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. The family is composed of 24-year-old Charlie (Matthew Fox), the eldest, a womanizing, immature manual laborer who struggles with the responsibility of being the new head of the family; 16-year-old Bailey (Scott Wolf), the once-rebellious teen forced into a role of responsible caretaker and later veering into alcoholism; 15-year-old Julia (Neve Campbell), a sensitive teen; 11-year-old Claudia (Lacey Chabert), a precocious child prodigy musician; and baby Owen, age one.

The siblings take over the running of their family&#x27;s restaurant, Salinger&#x27;s. Charlie initially serves as bartender and manager, and later Bailey takes over. Over the years, the Salingers face various struggles: the long-term effects of parental loss; in season three, Bailey&#x27;s attempt to recover from alcoholism; in season four, Charlie&#x27;s diagnosis with cancer; and in season five, Julia&#x27;s dealing with domestic violence in a relationship.

As the series progressed, romantic relationships became plot points and new cast members joined the show, including Jennifer Love Hewitt as Sarah, Bailey&#x27;s girlfriend; Jeremy London as Griffin, Julia&#x27;s &quot;bad-boy&quot; boyfriend and later husband; and Paula Devicq as Kirsten, Owen&#x27;s nanny, who develops an on-again-off-again relationship with Charlie throughout the series, until they get married during the show&#x27;s sixth and final season.

== Production ==
Fox Entertainment Group chairman Sandy Grushow commissioned the show as a possible replacement for &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, which was then in its fourth season. Grushow stated that &quot;I wanted a show that would possess many of the same values that &#x27;90210&#x27; had in the beginning. A show about teenagers and for teenagers. I pitched the notion of a group of kids who lost their parents in a tragic accident and therefore were forced to raise themselves.&quot;

When Christopher Keyser and Amy Lippman came on board to create the show, they disliked the more lighthearted premise the network had come up with, essentially of a bunch of teens without parents left to go wild, which Keyser called a &quot;&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead&quot; kind of thing.&quot; They decided to take the show in a more dramatic direction, where the characters have to deal with the serious repercussions of being orphaned and growing up.

Jerry O&#x27;Connell was initially offered the role of Bailey, but he chose to sign with the series &quot;Sliders&quot; instead. Scott Wolf auditioned and was cast the very same day, the first of the actors to be cast.
Neve Campbell, who was still living in Canada at the time, auditioned for &quot;Party of Five&quot; while she was in Los Angeles interviewing with different talent agencies to represent her. She auditioned along with her then-roommate Tara Strong, and ended up winning the role of Julia and moving to Los Angeles for the show, after it was picked up by Fox for a full series.

The show was produced by Columbia Pictures Television (CPT) and High Productions. CPT would later be folded into Columbia TriStar Domestic Television, which soon afterward became Sony Pictures Television.

== Critical reception ==
For the show&#x27;s first season, review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 85% based on 13 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A sincere family drama full of tear-jerking moments, &quot;Party of Five&quot; excels at its authentic depiction of young adult issues.&quot;

== Awards and nominations ==
==Reboot==

In January 2018, Freeform ordered a pilot for a reboot of &quot;Party of Five&quot;, featuring five children who must take care of themselves after their parents are deported back to Mexico. In April 2020, the reboot was canceled after one season.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Party of Five&quot; is credited with &quot;[moving] televised stories about and targeted at young adults away from the soap-opera genre and [helping to] make the medium safer for the more realistic teenagers we’d meet later on &quot;Dawson’s Creek&quot;, &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;, &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;, and &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.&quot;

In 2021, &quot;Party of Five&quot; was one of the shows featured in the third episode of season 1 of Vice Media&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the 90s&quot; entitled &quot;TV for Teens.&quot;

<text>Duncan Hallas (23 December 1925 – 19 September 2002), was a prominent member of the Trotskyist movement and a leading member of the Socialist Workers Party in Great Britain.

==Biography==
Born into a working-class family in Manchester, Duncan Hallas joined the Young Communist League at the age of 14 in 1939 but soon became disillusioned owing to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. In 1940, he met a woman selling &quot;Socialist Appeal&quot; at an Engineering Apprentices College where he was on day release and he joined the Trotskyist Workers International League in 1940 and then its successor organisation the Revolutionary Communist Party while still a young worker during the Second World War. Conscripted into the First Lancashire Regiment in 1943, he served in France, Belgium and Germany and he was also involved in the mutiny in Egypt after the end of the war, earning him three months in military prison. When factional disputes broke out in The Club (the name adopted by British Trotskyists after entering the Labour Party) Hallas became a supporter of Tony Cliff&#x27;s positions.

Hallas was a founder member of the tiny Socialist Review Group when it was organised in 1951 and wrote its only major founding document not authored by Cliff, &quot;On the Stalinist Parties&quot;. He also wrote a number of articles for the early issues of &quot;Socialist Review&quot;. After his job took him to Scotland in 1954/55 he effectively dropped out of the group, although he remained politically active in the National Union of Teachers and elsewhere.

With the upsurge in left-wing political activity in 1968 Hallas joined the International Socialists (IS) and rapidly became a member of the group&#x27;s leadership and a full-time worker at its headquarters. However, Hallas, along with some other leading members, became concerned about Tony Cliff&#x27;s increasing tendency to take decisions without consulting leadership bodies. Hallas initiated an oppositional group alongside John Palmer and Jim Higgins. However, when this oppositional group became a formal faction, the International Socialist Opposition (ISO), Hallas broke with it. He remained within the IS when the ISO&#x27;s members were expelled, becoming a leading figure in its successor organisation, the Socialist Workers Party, until his retirement from active politics, owing to ill health, in 1995.

Hallas was the author of many articles for the publications of the IS/SWP group and of a short guide to the politics of Leon Trotsky.

<doc id="432847" wikidata="Q36371396" url="?curid=432847" title="List of national monuments of Portugal">
<text>The national monuments of Portugal () were constructed throughout the Portuguese territory, and the oldest date back to the period of pre-historic settlement of occupation. Subsequently, the region that is today Portugal has been colonized by many civilizations, which have left marks in the territory, constructing markers, defensive structures, homes and places of worship to suit their requirements and means. The formal organization of the Portuguese state resulted in a process to qualify and quantify those structures that have had an intrinsic value to the Portuguese culture. Starting with the &quot;Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGMEN)&quot;, and later by the &quot;Instituto de Gestão do Património Arquitectónico e Arqueológico (IGESPAR)&quot;, the Portuguese government developed a registry of national monuments that includes a rich heritage of historical monuments throughout the country. This is a compilation of those structures that are designated as National Monuments only.

==History==
The first documented peoples to occupy the western coast of Iberia were the &quot;Ostrimni&quot; recorded in Ancient Latin poetry, whose territory stretched from Galicia (in northwestern Spain) to the Algarve (southern area of Portugal). The Greeks called the area of Portugal Ophiussa, and its inhabitants the Ophi. The serpent-worshipping Ophis are believed to have been a Celtic culture. These areas were eventually conquered, settled and assimilated by Indo-European peoples, made up of two probable invasions, the first by Proto-Celts who became the celebrated Lusitanians and the second by more developed Celts. Phoenicians also settled in trading posts along the coast and may have had contact with the assumably proto-Celtic Lusitanians, who, along with the Celtic Gallaeci, Celtici, Conii and Turduli became the base of the modern Portuguese ethnicity and culture. The Lusitanians along with the Gallaeci developed the Castro culture at the time of their invasion by the legions of Rome.

A formal organization of what would become Portugal began with the Roman occupation of the peninsula, which were responsible for re-purposing many of the castro settlements and moving the settlements from the hills to the valleys in the region. In the process, they constructed new buildings, established modern infrastructures (including internal water and baths) and a road network that connected Roman villas. Although there are many excavated ruins throughout the country, of particular importance are the Roman ruins of Conímbriga (Condeixa-a-Nova), in addition to many vestiges that encountered in the cities of Lisbon or Évora.

The disorganization in the Roman empire, which led to its fall, allowed the conquest by the Visigoths and the Christian Suevi in later years, along with other Germanic tribes. Many of the structures that survived this period include ancient churches and inscriptions built over previous constructions, which were the centre of Lusitanian settlements. Early Christian influences persisted for several centuries, until the Moors and Arab Berber peoples (from North Africa) invaded the Peninsula, including all of the territory which would eventually become Portugal. The Moors were first to construct many of the medieval castles that dot the landscapes of Portugal.

From the northern enclaves (Galicia and Asturias in Portugal&#x27;s case), the Christian Reconquista began, expanding progressively south towards the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. This was not a permanent expansion, since the Moorish-Christian frontier continued to expand and retract for several years, with the victories and defeats of each battle.

Meanwhile, Portugal became a county of the Kingdom of León and briefly during the independence of the Kingdom of Galicia in the 1060s and 1070s. It became an autonomous dominion of the Kingdom of León in 1128, emerging as a fully independent kingdom in 1139, officially recognized by the Treaty of Zamora in 1143. After this period, and with the rise of the Portuguese state after the beginning of the Age of Discovery, Portuguese architecture expanded under the patronage of the wealthy kings, nobility, powerful clergy and through the many battles with rivals such as Castile, the French and Dutch. During these periods, many of the prominent buildings were destroyed, rebuilt, re-purposed and closed on the whims of the monarchy, which progressively used architectural projects to support their power, remember past glories or expand their position in the Iberian Peninsula.

With the demise of the powerful clergy and religious orders, and eventually the fall of the monarchy in Portugal, many of the once important buildings in the country were either reused as seats of governmental power, abandoned into ruin or reused as museum, although some remained places of public use (such as the religious places of worship). The 20th century movement to restore and preserve the architectural history of Portugal was initiated under the &quot;Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGMEN)&quot; during the Estado Novo regime in order to inventory national treasures and preserve existing monuments.

==National monuments==
Although there are numerous monuments from various ages some of them have a special value due to their historical, architectural, artistic and cultural importance. These monuments are classified and protected by the &quot;Instituto de Gestão do Património Arquitectónico e Arqueológico (IGESPAR)&quot; (&quot;Institute for the Management of Architectural and Archaeological Heritage&quot;), which classifies national treasures in terms of several general criteria: historic and cultural, aesthetic and social, technical and scientific, but also includes issues of integrity, authenticity and exemplary importance.

Owing to its relative value and importance, the cultural property may be listed as or national, public or municipal interest. In addition, these definitions are also defined in terms of being monuments, groups of buildings or sites, based on existing international conventions. IGESPAR regularly proposes the listing of new assets based on its mission to safeguard national heritage. As time goes by, a wide variety of new buildings and groups of structures of varying typologies have been added to the national register of monuments, such modernist architecture, vernacular landscapes, archaeological sites, monastic buildings/structures, historical gardens, and more recently human-built business and industrial establishments.

The listing process follows a strict procedure defined by Decree-Law no. 309/2009 (23 October 2009), which entered into force in January 2010.

IGESPAR also monitors and participates in the UNESCO registry of World Heritage Sites as a member state: there are 13 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in territory of Portugal. Similarly, eleven assets in the UNESCO world heritage list of 878 sites were former Portuguese possessions at one time, spread across three continents (Africa, America and Asia) associated with period of Portuguese Discoveries.

<text>Ostallgäu is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Oberallgäu, Unterallgäu, Augsburg, Landsberg, Weilheim-Schongau and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and by the Austrian state of Tyrol. The town of Kaufbeuren is enclosed by but does not belong to the district.

==History==
Before 1803 the region was split into several tiny states, most of them clerical states. When these states were dissolved in 1803, the Ostallgäu region became part of Bavaria. The kings of Bavaria soon developed a special relationship with the region and built their famous castles of Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein there.

The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Kaufbeuren, Marktoberdorf and Füssen.

==Geography==

&quot;Ostallgäu&quot; literally means &quot;Eastern Allgäu&quot;. The term Allgäu is applied to the part of the Alps located in Swabia and their northern foothills.

The district extends from the crest of the Alps to hilly countryside in the north. It is located on either side of the Wertach, an affluent of the Lech. In the south there is a great number of alpine lakes, the largest of them being the Forggensee ().

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the heraldic lion of the medieval county of Ronsberg
* the sword of Saint Martin, the patron saint of Marktoberdorf
* an abbot&#x27;s staff representing the Füssen monastery

==Towns and municipalities==

<doc id="432852" wikidata="Q3531923" url="?curid=432852" title="Tony Valeri">
<text>Tony Valeri (born August 11, 1957) is a former Canadian politician. Valeri was the Government House Leader in Paul Martin&#x27;s government from 2004 until 2006. He was narrowly defeated by New Democratic (NDP) candidate Wayne Marston in the 2006 general election held on January 23, 2006.

==Biography==
Valeri grew up in Hamilton&#x27;s north-end in the working class Barton and Sherman neighbourhood, the son of Italian immigrants Enzo and Maria Valeri, who arrived in Hamilton in the early 1950s. He graduated from Bishop Ryan Catholic Secondary School and then attended McMaster University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. Prior to his political career, Valeri served as President of Canadian Financial Group Ltd. Valeri represented the ridings of Lincoln (1993–1997), then Stoney Creek (1997–2004) and Hamilton East—Stoney Creek (2004–2006). Valeri lives with his wife Terri and children, Anthony and Luca in Stoney Creek.

==Parliamentary career==
Valeri first ran for office in the 1993 election, winning the Liberal Party nomination over former cabinet minister John Munro, and easily won in the Liberal sweep of Ontario. Valeri served as a backbencher and was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance in 1997. He was appointed to the Cabinet on December 12, 2003, by incoming Prime Minister Paul Martin.

===2004 nomination contest===
In 2004, the decennial redistribution process took place and Valeri&#x27;s old riding of Stoney Creek, which straddled the border between Hamilton and Grimsby, was split in two. A part of Valeri&#x27;s Stoney Creek riding was merged with a part of Hamilton - East. A slight majority of the constituents of the new riding of Hamilton East - Stoney Creek were from Valeri&#x27;s former riding. Although the other Hamilton-area Members of Parliament shifted to the eastward half of their ridings, in Valeri&#x27;s case this would have meant shifting from a suburban Hamilton riding to the rural Niagara West—Glanbrook riding, where he would have faced a difficult battle with a candidate of the Conservative Party of Canada.

He therefore decided to run in the western half of his former riding, resulting in a passionate nomination battle with former cabinet heavyweight and party leadership candidate Sheila Copps. Some accused Martin of orchestrating these events to try to expel the left-leaning Copps from the House of Commons. On March 6, 2004, Valeri won the nomination by 311 votes. Stelco&#x27;s economic troubles and the large pension deficit galvanized support for New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Tony DePaulo in Hamilton East—Stoney Creek. The conflict with Copps, public reaction to the first budget of the Ontario Liberals, as well as the government&#x27;s sinking fortunes, almost cost him his seat, but he was narrowly (less than 1,000 votes) re-elected on June 28, 2004.

===Government House Leader===
On July 20, 2004, he was appointed to the sensitive position of Government House Leader in Paul Martin&#x27;s minority government. Valeri&#x27;s appointment to the position of House Leader was originally questioned by many, however Valeri was able to establish a working relationship with his counterparts.

As noted by Libby Davies, NDP House Leader, &quot;We had some crazy moments but we always got down to business in a real way. It was a pleasure to work with (Valeri).&quot; Former Conservative House Leader John Reynolds noted that &quot;Tony was a great House Leader. A man of integrity and good humour.&quot;

In his 2008 memoir, entitled &quot;Hell Or High Water: My Life In And Out of Politics&quot; (), former Prime Minister Paul Martin labeled Valeri as “one of the most gifted House Leaders of recent times.”

===2006 re-election bid===
On January 23, 2006, Valeri was narrowly defeated by a margin of less than 500 votes by the New Democratic Party candidate Wayne Marston. During the election, the Hamilton Spectator reported that Valeri had purchased a property for $225,000 only to later sell it to a Liberal supporter for $500,000 a few months later. While Valeri insisted that the Ethics Commissioner had cleared the transaction, lingering doubts about the sale remained.

==Post-political career==
After his election defeat, Valeri established a public affairs and strategic consulting business and held a residence position within the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University. On December 5, 2007, the Hamilton Port Authority named Valeri its interim CEO effective on December 17, 2007. He left the post in 2008.

As of June 2011, Valeri has held the position of Vice President Public Affairs at ArcelorMittal Dofasco in Hamilton.

<text>Wilhelm Wolff Beer (4 January 1797 – 27 March 1850) was a banker and astronomer from Berlin, Prussia, and the brother of Giacomo Meyerbeer.

==Astronomy==
Beer&#x27;s fame derives from his hobby, astronomy. He built a private observatory with a 9.5 cm refractor in Tiergarten, Berlin. Together with Johann Heinrich Mädler he produced the first exact map of the Moon (entitled &quot;Mappa Selenographica&quot;) in 1834–1836, and in 1837 published a description of the Moon (&quot;Der Mond nach seinen kosmischen und individuellen Verhältnissen&quot;). Both remained the best descriptions of the Moon for many decades.

In 1830, Beer and Mädler created the first globe of the planet Mars. In 1840 they made a map of Mars and calculated its rotation period to be 24 h 37 min 22.7 s, only 0.1 seconds different from the actual period as it is known today.

==Other work==
In addition to his hobby of astronomy, he helped with the establishment of a railway system in Prussia, and promoted the Jewish community in Berlin. In his last decade of life, he worked as a writer and politician. In 1849 he was elected as an MP for the first chamber of the Prussian parliament.

==Named after Beer==
The crater Beer on Mars is named in Wilhelm Beer&#x27;s honor and lies near Mädler. There is also a crater called Beer on the Moon.

<text>A joik or yoik (anglicised, where the latter spelling in English conforms with the pronunciation; also named &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, or &#x27; in the Sámi languages) is a traditional form of song in Sámi music performed by the Sámi people of Sapmi in Northern Europe. A performer of joik is called a &#x27; (in Finnish), a &#x27; (in Norwegian, and anglicised) or  (in Swedish). Originally, &quot;joik&quot; referred to only one of several Sami singing styles, but in English the word is often used to refer to all types of traditional Sami singing. As an art form, each joik is meant to reflect or evoke a person, animal, or place.

The sound of joik is comparable to the traditional chanting of some Native American cultures. Joik shares some features with the shamanistic cultures of Siberia, which mimic the sounds of nature.

== History ==
As the Sami culture had no written language in the past, the origins of joik are not documented. According to oral traditions, the fairies and elves of the arctic lands gave joiks to the Sámi People. Just Qvigstad, who recorded the Sami oral tradition, has documented this legend in several works. Music researchers believe joik is one of the oldest continuous musical traditions in Europe.

During the Christianization of the Sami, joiking was condemned as sinful. The assimilation policies (Norwegianization and similar) and the views of churches and ecclesiastical movements on joiking as sin have played important roles in its devaluation. One of the reasons that joiking was controversial may be its association with &quot;Noaidi&quot; (Sámi shamans) and pre-Christian mythology rituals, with joiking said to resemble magic spells. In the 1950s, it was forbidden to use joiking in Sami area schools. In 2014, a parish council discussed &quot;if they should implement a total ban against music other than [church] hymns in the churches in Kautokeino and Maze. The proposal was shot down, but many still wonder why joiking in church is such a controversial issue&quot;.

Despite this suppression, joiking was strongly rooted in the culture and its tradition was maintained. Joiking is still practiced and is used as a source of inspiration. Recently, joiks are sung in two different styles: a traditional style, known as the &quot;mumbling&quot; style; and a modern style sung mostly by young people, and used as an element in contemporary Sami music.

== Personal and evocative nature ==
The joik is a unique form of cultural expression for the Sami people in Sápmi. This type of song can be deeply personal or spiritual in nature, often dedicated to a human being, an animal, or a landscape as a personal signature. Improvisation is not unusual. Each joik is meant to reflect a person or place. The Sami verb for presenting a joik (e.g. Northern Sami &quot;juoigat&quot;) is a transitive verb, which is often interpreted as indicating that a joik is not a song about the person or place, but that the joiker is attempting to evoke or depict that person or place through song – one joiks one&#x27;s friend, not about one&#x27;s friend (similarly to how one doesn&#x27;t paint or depict &quot;about&quot; a flower, but depicts the flower itself).

== Musical and lyrical forms ==
Traditionally, joiks have short lyrics or no lyrics at all. However, there are other forms of joik (in the expanded sense of the word) that have a more epic type of lyrics. Joik is traditionally chanted a cappella, but in modern times may be accompanied by a drum (though not a Sami drum, which is used for ceremonial purposes only) or other musical instruments. The tonality of joik is mostly pentatonic, but &quot;joikers&quot; are at liberty to use any tones they please.

In northern Sami areas, most joiks are &quot;personal,&quot; that is, tied to a specific person. A joik is often made for a person at the time he or she is born. British actress Joanna Lumley experienced several joiks during her travel program &quot;Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights&quot;, joining a northern Sami elder. Lumley learned that there appeared not to be a joik of the Aurora, and that the Sami do not talk much about them.

Joiking encompasses different styles:

* &quot;Vuelie&quot; is a South Sami joiking with an old-world feel, since its development was halted in the face of Christianity. To avoid being seen as savage or heathen, the South Sami mostly stopped joiking.
* &quot;Luohti&quot; is the North Sami variant and currently the most-developed joiking style.

Leuʹdd, known from the Skolt Sámi tradition is not a variant of joik, but a rather different kind of singing.

== Imitative sounds and shamanism ==

Some of the Sami people&#x27;s traditional Noaidi beliefs and practices shared important features with those of some Siberian cultures. Some of their joiks were sung during shamanistic rites, and this memory is conserved also in a folklore text (a shaman story). As in various cultures of Northern Asia, mimicking sounds from nature can also be present.

== Joiking in popular culture ==
Even though joiking is a traditional form of singing, it has found its way into modern-day pop culture through adaptation and commercialization by various artists. One notable example is the 1980 Norwegian entry &quot;Sámiid ædnan&quot; for the Eurovision Song Contest, which features a song predominantly sung in Norwegian and interwoven with joiking in its chorus. Subsequently, this song has been occasionally used as a game chant by Norwegian football fans, as well as British fans from the Accrington Stanley F.C. Furthermore, an uncredited sample of this song was featured in the 2011 science-fiction horror film &quot;The Thing&quot;. The Norwegian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot;, also has lines of joik in the chorus, and includes a joik solo.

Through its inclusion in other popular films, the Sami culture and joiking in particular has managed to achieve national acclaim. Of particular note is Disney&#x27;s &quot;Frozen&quot; and its sequel &quot;Frozen 2&quot;, which are heavily inspired by Scandinavian and Sami culture. This is evident in its use of typical elements of the Sami people, including reindeer herding and outfit styles. Furthermore, South Sami musician and joiker Frode Fjellheim composed the opening track of &quot;Frozen&quot;, titled &quot;Vuelie&quot;, which is an adaptation of his original track &quot;Eatnemen Vuelie (Song of the Earth)&quot;. This growing adaptation of Sami elements, in particular joiking, points towards a gradual revitalization of the culture.

Joiking is also an important element of the Sami Grand Prix, an annual music competition modeled after the Eurovision Song Contest. This competition draws contestants from Norway, Sweden and Finland, with strong representation from minorities belonging to the Sami community. The traditional art form is significant in both the joik and song competition of the Grand Prix. In the joik component, contestants, usually dressed in traditional Sami clothing, perform joiks that are specifically prepared for the competition, without any accompanying instruments. The succeeding song component features participants who often incorporate elements of joiking into their pop entries, which suggests a revival and growing appeal of infusing traditional Sami musical practices with modern-day music.

In addition, the 1970s proved to be a fruitful period for the Sami people and joik music in particular, with what academics have coined the &quot;joik renaissance&quot;. Specifically, the emergence of Sami-owned record company, Jårgalæddji, in Norway, that resulted from a collaboration between Sami musicians. As a result, it became easier for Sami artistes and producers to gain funding for their projects, with over 40 albums and cassettes of Sami and joik music released in that period. Sources of funding included not only private investors, but also the Norwegian and Swedish culture boards. This led to an unprecedented commercialization of Sami music, as well as the performance of joiking, which was a crucial focus of the Jårgalæddji. While the bankruptcy of this record company in the mid-1980s led to a slowdown in production of Sami and joik albums, such growth led to a resurgence of interest in traditional Sami culture and music.

Other artists who are famous for their interpretations of joik include Mari Boine, Jon Henrik Fjällgren and the band Korpiklaani, who have combined joiks with various other styles such as jazz, metal and rock. In particular, Fjallgren won the Swedish Talang 2014 competition, a reality talent show, through his moving rendition of traditional joik songs. He subsequently released a debut studio album in 2014, Goeksegh, which features multiple joik tracks such as &quot;Daniel’s Joik&quot;, &quot;The Reindeer Herder’s Joik&quot;, and &quot;Nejla’s Joik&quot;, and took part several times in Melodifestivalen, Sweden&#x27;s Eurovision selection, with joik songs.

<doc id="432888" wikidata="Q830370" url="?curid=432888" title="Honda Prelude">
<text>The is a sport compact car produced by the Japanese company Honda. It was once produced over five generations from 1978 to 2001. It is planned to be reintroduced in 2025.

As a two-door coupé loosely derived from the Honda Accord, the Prelude was the first Honda to feature a moonroof, a feature that remained standard equipment throughout its production. 

The Prelude was used by Honda to introduce the Japanese Honda retail sales chain &quot;Honda Verno,&quot; with the international release of the model following shortly after. The Prelude&#x27;s manufacture concluded in 2001 on introduction of the fourth-generation Integra. The Prelude name was originally trademarked by Toyota, but was amicably given to Honda for use. 

The Prelude&#x27;s nameplate aligned with a series of music-themed nameplates in use by Honda, including the Accord, Quintet, Concerto, Jazz, and Ballade.

On 24 November 1978, the Prelude was launched to the Japanese market. It had its world premiere at the 1979 AutoRAI in Amsterdam, two months later. In Japan it was only available at the newly established dealership sales channel &quot;Honda Verno&quot;. This dealership chain also introduced the Honda Quint, the Honda Ballade, and the Accord-based Honda Vigor as its largest sedan and hatchback. The four-wheel independent struts, brakes, and engine were all borrowed from the first-generation Accord, but the chassis was all new and developed by chief engineer Hiroshi Kizawa expressly for the sporting Prelude. At 4,090 mm (length) x 1,635 mm (width) x 1,290 mm (height), it had quite a low and wide profile. The wheelbase was 2,320 mm, and was 60 mm shorter than that of the original Accord. Honda appears to have followed the successful introduction of the Toyota Celica example by taking a small car, like the Accord, installing a more powerful engine, and giving the body a short trunk, and a long engine hood. The Prelude (and period Accord) were the first cars under two liters to receive standard power steering. The Prelude also benefited from Honda&#x27;s experience with sporting cars like the Honda S800 and Coupé 1300.

The Prelude was the first Honda model to offer a power moonroof as standard equipment, which eventually became a Prelude trademark. In Japan, the Prelude was available with a sliding metal sunroof, while US versions received a glass top which freed up more headroom. Japanese buyers were liable for slightly more annual road taxes over the smaller Civic, which also had a smaller engine. While marketed as a 2+2, the rear seat was not usable for anyone larger than a small child.

Initial reviews for the Prelude were favorable. &quot;It is,&quot; wrote Brock Yates for &quot;Motor Trend&quot;, &quot;by any sane measurement, a splendid automobile. The machine, like all Hondas, embodies fabrication that is, in my opinion, surpassed only by the narrowest of margins by Mercedes-Benz. It is a relatively powerful little automobile by anybody&#x27;s standards.&quot; &quot;Motor Trend&quot; measured an early Prelude completing the quarter-mile in 18.8 seconds at 70 mph. In terms of underpinnings it was mostly a Honda Accord, although its more compact package and lower weight allowed for a marginally higher top speed and gas mileage.
The standard engine at the time of introduction was the &quot;EL&quot; SOHC eight-valve 1,602 cc (non-CVCC) inline-four rated at at 5,000 rpm and at 3,500 rpm. It remained the only engine available for most markets, aside from the US and Japan. It featured a non-automatic choke with three positions and a two-barrel carburetor. In September 1978 the larger &quot;EK&quot; SOHC 12-valve 1,751 cc CVCC inline-four was introduced in Japan, rated at at 5,300 rpm (SAE gross). Automatics had five less horsepower. It took until March 1979 for the Prelude to appear in the United States, then with at 4,500 rpm and at 3,000 rpm (SAE net) from the larger 1.8 engine. The EK engine made use of an engine oil cooler and transistor-controlled ignition system.

Transmission choices were either the standard five-speed manual or initially a two-speed &quot;Hondamatic&quot; semi-automatic, which by October 1979 had been replaced by a three-speed automatic that used the final gear as the overdrive. In addition to the standard fabrics offered in most models, an &#x27;Executive&#x27; option was offered in some markets which added power steering and Connolly leather upholstery. Honda used a single central gauge cluster design in this car which housed the speedometer and tachometer in one combined unit where both instrument&#x27;s needles swept along the same arc. They also placed the compact AM/FM radio unit up high next to the gauge cluster. The Prelude featured intermittent wipers, tinted glass, and a remote trunk release. 1980 saw the introduction of the CVCC-II engine which employed the use of a catalytic converter and several other refinements that improved driveability, the Prelude also received a mild facelift in 1981. This facelift meant a return to a more traditional dashboard, rather than the much critiqued &quot;Concentrated Target Meter&quot; used before. The 1981 Prelude also received a stainless steel trim strip along the bumpers and side moldings, as well as a new grille. 313,000 units were manufactured by Honda from 1978 to 1982, with over 80% being sold outside of Japan. 41,190 Preludes were sold in the home market during its production run.

The Prelude was introduced in Europe during 1979, but was not a strong seller, its high asking price not helping its chances of sales success.

==Second generation (1982)==
The second-generation Prelude was released in Japan on 25 November 1982 and worldwide in the spring of 1983. Riding on an all-new platform, the Prelude was initially available with an A18A or ET-2, 1.8 L 12-valve twin carburetor engine, producing . In Japan, Asia and Europe, it later became available with a 2-liter DOHC 16-valve PGM-FI engine (JDM = BA1, EU = BA2) although this engine was not released in Europe until 1986. The JDM B20A produced at 6300 rpm, while the European B20A1 produced only . This was the first generation of Prelude to have pop-up headlights, which allowed for a more aerodynamic front clip, reducing drag. Opening the headlights, however, especially at higher speeds, produced significantly more drag. The design retained nothing of the first generation, being considerably more aerodynamic and with large glass surfaces. As with the predecessor, it was amply equipped, with an air of &quot;mini-gran turismo&quot; rather than that of a sports car. It also offered, as an option, Honda&#x27;s new &quot;A.L.B.&quot; anti-lock brakes.

In Japan, the Prelude was one of the key models sold at Japanese Honda dealership sales channels, called &quot;Honda Verno&quot;, which offered performance-oriented products. All &quot;Honda Verno&quot; products, like the Vigor, initially shared the concealed headlights introduced with this generation Prelude that would help identify &quot;sports&quot; products from Honda in Japan. The approach was short-lived, however. The model with the 2.0 liter engine was regarded as the top level car in Japan because Japanese buyers were liable for a higher annual road tax over the car with the 1.8 liter engine. The Japanese 1.8 had CVCC and claimed , considerably more than export models.
When the 2-liter 16-valve DOHC engine came out the hood had to be slightly modified since the larger engine could not fit under the original hood. The original 1.8-liter engine was developed specifically for the Prelude to allow a low hoodline, even tilting the engine backward to make it lower yet. The European version also saw slight modifications to the rear lights and revised front and rear bumpers which were now color-matched. Due to the fairly low weight of the car () and high power (the 16-valve engine produced in Japanese trim), the car was relatively nimble in comparison to its competitors, which most Preludes had not been up to that time.

The North American 1983 model is identifiable by its standard painted steel wheels with bright trim rings (although alloy rims were optional). The 1984-87 base models had Civic-style full wheel covers. In Canada, a &quot;Special Edition&quot; trim was created, which is essentially the same as the USA 2.0Si &quot;sport injected&quot; model. Fuel injection was introduced in the &quot;Si&quot; models in 1985. North American 1.8&#x27;s offered at 5,500 rpm, while the later 2.0 has at the same engine speed.

This version of the Prelude was far more popular in Britain than its predecessor, and sold well at a time when sports cars were declining in popularity and many manufacturers were withdrawing from this market sector; including Ford, who did not replace the Capri after its 1986 demise, even though it had been one of Britain&#x27;s 10 most popular new cars as recently as 1980. The European lineup originally consisted of the base Prelude, without power steering, and the well-equipped EX which was also available with an automatic transmission and the A.L.B. brakes.

== Third generation (1987)==

On 9 April 1987, the third-generation Prelude was released in the Japanese domestic market and released later that year worldwide, being a 1988 model in North America. Featuring evolutionary styling from its predecessor, it shared design cues from the Honda NSX that would be introduced later in 1990. The Prelude featured innovative features for its time such as a 0.34 drag coefficient, roof pillars made of high-strength metal and its signature feature, the available option of the world&#x27;s first mechanical four-wheel steering system available in a mass-production passenger car, which was later shared with the Honda Ascot 2.0FBT-i sedan.
The mechanical four-wheel steering setup used two steering boxes, linked together with a dedicated steering shaft. Despite its complexity, it provided the driver additional benefits. At highway speeds lane changes required minimal steering input, and served as a safety feature providing more responsive and quicker maneuverability in adverse conditions. It also aided in low speed driving conditions such as parallel parking. The front and rear wheels would turn in opposite directions once the steering wheel had been turned 140 degrees. A &#x27;Road &amp; Track&#x27; magazine comparison between the Prelude and a C4-series Chevrolet Corvette favored the Prelude in a slalom speed test.

Honda had expected 30% of buyers to opt for four-wheel-steering, but the car was a runaway success in the home market and 80% of buyers did in the first year.

The third-generation Prelude was exclusively powered by variants of the Honda B20A engine, a base carbureted version with a SOHC 12-valve valvetrain, or a DOHC variant with Honda&#x27;s PGM-FI fuel injection and 16 valves. The engine was tilted backwards by 18 degrees, which made it possible to make the hood lower than on the previous generation.

It was well received by judges of the European Car of the Year accolade for 1988, finishing third in a contest where the Peugeot 405 was the runaway winner and the Citroën AX came second. This was one of the best performances by a Japanese built or branded car until the Nissan Micra won the award five years later.

In 1987, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; published a test summary that shows the 1988 Honda Prelude 2.0Si 4WS outperforming every car of that year on the slalom, with a speed of , even besting exotics such as Porsche and Ferrari. For reference, the 1988 Chevrolet Corvette C4 took the same course at .

The Prelude was &quot;Wheels magazine&#x27;s&quot; Car of the Year for 1987.

===Mid-cycle refresh and Prelude INX===


The facelift third-generation Prelude was revealed in Japan on 21 November 1989. The front and rear bumpers were revised on the new Prelude. The rear front bumper and rear tail lights featured clear indicators and a revised parking light design. Many of the interior parts were also revised, including the dash bezel, the door handle and window switches. The Japanese version of the Si with the B20A was rated 140 PS with the JDM engine and was rated for 37 MPG.

Along with the facelift, a new Prelude model was introduced to the Japanese domestic market, the Prelude INX. It featured fixed headlights, with a front fascia very similar to the contemporary Honda Legend coupe and Honda Accord of the same time period. It also featured chrome trim on the headlights front and rear bumpers, side moldings, tail lights and both front and rear windscreens to enhance the focus on luxury rather than sportiness. The Prelude INX coincided with changes to North American lighting requirements in the United States and Canada, and a greater focus on safety was offered with available anti-lock brakes and optional driver&#x27;s side airbag exclusively offered on the Si/SR/S models.

In the US, the facelifted Prelude debuted for the 1990 model year, with the carbureted 2.0S model being discontinued. The fuel-injected 2.0 Si became the entry-level model, being supplanted by a new Si model with the B21A1 engine, with Si 4WS or Si ALB (ABS) as optional trim models. The revised version of the B20A5, called the B21A1 was available. It was bored to with a total displacement of 2,056 cc producing up to and had a special cylinder liner featuring FRM (fiber reinforced metal) that is reported to be extremely tough. This causes premature piston ring wear contributing to exceptionally high oil consumption.

For the Canadian market, the S, SR and SR 4WS models were introduced for 1990. In 1991, SR ALB and SE models were introduced. The SE model was closer to the JDM and EDM models in that it was fully optioned with leather interior and was equipped with both 4WS and ALB.

=== Prelude SiStates and Prelude SiTCV ===

Honda released two new special limited edition trim models in Japan in 1989 for the facelift Prelude, the Prelude SiStates and Prelude SiTCV. These cars were a limited production run and very few were built. SiStates catalogues indicate 3,000 built. They both featured standard 4WS, ALB, Viscous limited-slip differential (LSD) transmissions, TCS (SiTCV only), leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear lever, extra sound-deadening insulation on the firewall and hood, and many more features that were usually options. The SiStates also featured a Japanese version of the 2.1 liter B21A1 engine called the B21A rated at . Two major distinctions of the SiStates was that it was the same width as the Prelude sold in North America, from which it took its name, due to the wider side moldings. The other being that it was over 2.0 liters, a limitation in engine displacement in Japan for insurance reasons. The extra width and the larger engine combined to place the Prelude SiStates in a considerably higher road tax obligation; while this slowed sales it also targeted some status hungry buyers. The SiStates model was only available with the MY8A LSD equipped automatic transmission. The SiTCV model was available with the MY8A automatic or the D2M5 5-speed manual gearbox.
== Fourth generation (1991)==
On 19 September 1991, the fourth-generation Prelude was introduced in Japan, and in Europe from early 1992. The car had a 58% front and 42% rear weight distribution. The four-wheel steering system was changed to an electronic version and the 4-cylinder engine was increased in displacement from 2.1 liters to 2.2 liters for the base model &quot;S&quot; (SOHC F22A1 engine, at 5,200 rpm, at 4,000 rpm) and &quot;VTEC&quot; model (DOHC VTEC H22A1, at 6,800 rpm, at 5,500 rpm), with a 2.3-liter for the &quot;Si&quot; (DOHC H23A1, at 5,800 rpm, at 5,300 rpm). The Japanese Si came with the F22B (2.2 L DOHC non-VTEC, ). The VTEC model had an upgraded brake system, going from a 10.3-inch (262 mm) front rotor to an 11.1-inch (282 mm) front rotor and utilizing larger brake caliper and pads, similar to those found in the Honda Vigor. Its styling approach is similar to the Honda Ascot Innova during the same time period.

Additionally, a 2.0i, single overhead cam (SOHC) model was released in Europe, rated at . 1993 was the last year that the &quot;Si-VTEC&quot; (BB4) name was used, and beginning in 1994 it was shortened to just &quot;VTEC&quot; and stayed that way throughout the rest of the generation. In some countries, the Prelude with 2.2 DOHC VTEC 4-cylinder engine was called the VTi-R. Later, the &#x27;96 prelude Si/SR was introduced with a 2.3 DOHC 4-cylinder engine. In Canada, the Si was called the SR, and the VTEC was called the SR-V. Due to the width dimensions and the engine displacement exceeding Japanese government regulations for vehicles classified as &quot;compact&quot;, this generation Prelude obligated Japanese owners to yearly taxes.

This model also marked the end for the pop-up headlights. The 1992 Prelude incorporated other design features that had also become the &quot;Prelude standard&quot;. The rear end was rounded and fairly high in comparison to the previous square trunk line. The front fascia of the car became wider with fixed headlights. The glass moonroof made way for a steel sliding sunroof which no longer retracted into the car but extended out and over it.

The light-blue back lighting introduced in the third generation was continued. Later models (1994 and on) also featured translucent speedometer and tachometer needles. All VTEC &amp; SE models received leather interior. Also featured was an 8-speaker audio system (Gathers DSP 8-speaker System) which included a center dash-mounted speaker and rear center subwoofer, while the U.S. VTEC model received only 7 speakers (center dash speaker not included). U.S. S and Si models received a 6-speaker stereo (no subwoofer). The Japanese version also included a digital climate control system. The Canadian version received some options which were not available in the United States. For instance, the Japanese Prelude had power folding mirrors as well as a rear windscreen wiper, while the Canadian market was the one to have heated mirrors and optional heated seats. The Japanese model came with optional Honda Access accessories such as Typus ski racks, under dash lights, headrest covers, a cabin air filter, and floor mats. Some of the Japanese domestic market fourth-generation Prelude VTECs did not come with options such as a sunroof and 4-wheel steering, as it was possible to skip these options when buying in Japan. The fourth-generation Prelude also shares some suspension components with the fifth-generation (1994–97) Honda Accord.

===Models and markets===


===F1 Racing Uses ===
The Prelude was used in Formula One as its Safety Car during the 1994 Japanese Grand Prix. It was also used once as a pace car, at the Suzuka International Racing Course in 1992.

== Fifth generation (1996)==
Introduced on 7 November 1996, the fifth-generation Prelude retained an FF layout with an independent front suspension and 63/37 weight distribution. The fifth-generation Prelude marked a return to the more square bodystyle of the third generation (1987–1991), in an attempt to curb slumping sales of the fourth-generation bodystyle. The two-door notchback style is retained but the design is less aggressive and more angular than the previous generation. The redesigned sports coupe is slightly larger than its predecessor at longer in wheelbase and overall. Base curb weight increased by and interior dimensions are nearly identical but trunk space expanded by nearly 1 cubic foot.
The ATTS model received Honda&#x27;s Active Torque Transfer System; badged as the Type S in Japan, VTi-S in Europe, and Type SH (&quot;Super Handling&quot;) in North America. ATTS automatically distributes more of the engine&#x27;s power to the outside front wheel when accelerating in a turn. This forces the outside front wheel to rotate up to 15 percent faster than the inside wheel directing up to 80 percent of the torque to a single wheel. ATTS was designed to counteract the understeer inherent in a front-wheel drive car, but the Prelude&#x27;s 63.1 percent front weight distribution was too much for the system to successfully mask.

The Prelude was available in three models for Canada and two models for the US (the Base and Type SH). All North American models came with a (later increased to 200HP) 2.2-liter DOHC VTEC 4-cylinder engine and 16-inch alloy wheels. The optional automatic transmission has a new manual-shift feature called Sequential SportShift. The gear lever can be left in Drive, which allows automatic shifting or it can be tipped forward or backward to allow manual shifting. A 5-speed manual transmission was standard. The Type SH was only available with a 5-speed manual transmission.

The 2.0i and JDM Si trims came with 195/60 R15 tires mounted on steel wheels, and the JDM Xi came with 14-inch steel wheels. Unlike the North American market Preludes, JDM Preludes came with rear windscreen wipers, except for the Xi. Australian and JDM Preludes weigh less than American and European models: VTi-R manual weighs , autos weigh , and the ATTS weighs .

Most fifth-generation Preludes came with aluminum alloy wheels with all-season 205/50 R16 87V tires, featured the 11.1-inch front brakes with 5-lug hubs and anti-lock brakes are standard. US models were well equipped and the Type SH only added ATTS, a leather-wrapped shift knob, and a rear spoiler over the base model.

All models and trim packages stayed within the BB-chassis code (BB5-BB9) and housed either an H-series or F-Series engine:
=== 1999 refresh ===
For the 1999 model year, the Prelude received a mid-cycle refresh; this included a increase in power for manual ( from ) and automatic ( from ) transmission models, a new front grille featuring a small &quot;Prelude&quot; badge, an access door to the cabin air filtration system allowing for cabin air filter replacement without modifications, and changes to available colours.

=== Canadian market ===
Canadian-market Preludes were very similar to US models, although all were equipped with heated seats as standard equipment, and received a 4.5-liter washer fluid reservoir in place of the smaller 2.5-liter US spec. In 2001, Canada received a replacement for the Type SH, the SE trim level. The SE was mechanically identical to base models, but it came equipped with perforated, heated leather seats, Type SH Enkei rims, Type SH spoiler, a leather-wrapped shift knob, and simulated carbon fiber trim kit on the door panels and audio panel. The SE did not receive body-colored side skirts as standard like the Type SH, and also did not feature the active torque transfer system (ATTS). Dealer accessories for Canadian vehicles included: carbon fiber audio panel, sunroof visor, 6-disc-in-dash CD changer, trunk-mounted CD changer, cassette player, roof rack, gold-plated emblem kit, gold-plated exhaust finisher, leather-wrapped shift knob, full and half nose mask, security system, and a cargo mat.

=== Japanese-exclusive Type S ===

One version of the fifth generation Prelude, a high-performance model called the Type S, was only available in Japan. It was equipped with the 2.2 L H22A, featuring VTEC and producing at 7,200 rpm and 163 lbf·ft (221 N·m) at 6,500 rpm. With a compression ratio of 11.0:1, bore x stroke and VTEC-valve timing, lift and duration were adjusted to intake and exhaust. Honda also overhauled the air box and replaced it with a more efficient design that is often referred to as &quot;Dynamic Chambering,&quot; along with a larger throttle body design bored to 62 mm (as opposed to the previous 60 mm). The exhaust system was also treated to a redesign, with the pipe cross sections becoming more cylindrical rather than oval. The three-way catalytic converter was also increased in size, as well as the exhaust piping from (tToV). In addition to a higher output engine Type S and like all ATTS equipped Preludes featured an overhauled front suspension layout which offered a more effective camber curve. The fifth generation curb weight was , and ground clearance was . The Type S, has an electronically controlled torque vectoring system attached to the manual transmission dubbed by Honda the Active Torque Transfer System (ATTS). The gearing on the Type S matches most other fifth-generation Preludes equipped with a manual transmission, excluding the five-speed 2.2 VTi VTEC which has a final drive ratio of 4.266:1. The Type S has an Active Control ABS system, different from the others which have the standard ABS systems. The interior featured newly developed synthentic materials called Cabron and Excene to upholster the seats which most people perceive as leather and Alcantara laced with red stitching. Manufacturer styling options included seat lettering. The exterior styling of fifth generation Preludes was standardized for most models. All had a sunroof except for the Japanese Type S, Xi trim and some BB9s.

=== Prelude Motegi ===
Honda also released a special edition fifth-generation Prelude, called Motegi. The name of this special edition derives from the Twin Ring Motegi motor racing circuit, located in Haga District, Tochigi, Japan. This track was built in 1997 by Honda as part of their effort to bring the IndyCar series to Japan.

The Motegi edition Prelude featured an OEM Honda body kit, 17-inch Honda alloy wheels, lowered sports suspension and a Motegi badge on the trunk lid. All of these items, with the exception of the trunk lid badge, were optional on non-Motegi models.

== Sixth generation (2025)==
The Prelude nameplate has been revived for a hybrid electric concept car, showcased at the 2023 Japan Mobility Show. Another example finished in red made its debut in July 2024 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where the Prelude was also confirmed for a European release. The revival of the Prelude nameplate is part of Honda&#x27;s recent revival of old nameplates, such as Passport and Integra. 

The new Prelude will serve as a replacement for the discontinued Civic and Accord Coupes and is set for global release in 2025. The model features a new drive mode, Honda S+ Shift.

==Sales==
Sales weakened beginning with the third generation Prelude, particularly due to competition from Honda&#x27;s other offerings. The sixth-generation Accord coupe received an exclusive front fascia, rear tail lights, wheels and many other body panels, now being marketed alongside the Prelude with shared brochures in Canada, yet its sedan roots gave it much more utility than the comparatively cramped Prelude, and the option of a V6 engine gave North American buyers an appealing alternative. The sixth-generation Civic Si coupe was considerably less expensive than the Prelude as well, while also providing better fuel economy ratings. The Honda S2000 was another offering that while more expensive than the Prelude, offered rear wheel drive, a six-speed transmission, 40 extra horsepower, and a convertible top. The exterior dimensions of the Prelude were no longer in compliance with Japanese government regulations, and the additional costs resulting from this contributed to the popularity of smaller Honda products. US sales figures below.

==Safety==
===Australia===
In Australia, the safety performance of Honda Preludes manufactured between 1983 and 2001 was assessed in the &quot;Buyers Guide to used Car Safety Ratings 2006&quot;, which was published by the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority (a New South Wales, Australia, government agency). This publication concluded that the level of occupant protection in Preludes from 1983 to 1996 was at an &quot;average&quot; level, while in Preludes from 1997 to 2001 is &quot;significantly better than average.&quot;

===U.S.===
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States has determined frontal crash test ratings of Honda Preludes of different model years.
==Awards==
The Prelude was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual Ten Best list ten times: three times from 1984 to 1986, and then seven times from 1992 to 1998, although the biggest complaint over much of the Prelude&#x27;s lifespan was the lack of availability of a V-6 engine option, especially in the US.

==Convertibles==

Through the years, several German and US companies have converted Preludes into convertibles. There have been convertibles made from the first, second and fourth generation Preludes.

First-generation Preludes were modified into full convertibles by several companies in the US, Canada and Germany. The 
Solaire Corporation, a company in Santa Ana California owned by Al Rowland &amp; Jim Bruemmer, led the idea for mass market sales. He brought in craftsman Bruce Meyers (Known for the famous Meyers Manx Dune Buggy) to help design the tooling and fiberglass work for production. Its believed that between 1980 - 1982, 250 Preludes were modified into convertibles and sold to US Honda dealerships with full factory warranties. Dealer prices ranged from $14,000-$15,000, while the conversion itself sold for around $5,000. Solaire collaborated with other companies including Classic Touch, Con-tec, Silcco, Steas Industries and National Coach. It was marketed as &quot;Honda&#x27;s 450 SL&quot;, drawing aesthetic comparisons to the Mercedes 450SL.

Tropic Design, located in Crailsheim, Germany also converted Preludes into convertibles. Company owner Jürgen Weber learned this trade in the United States. In total, they modified 47 Preludes. Very few have remained in Europe, initially all in Germany. Some have been sold over time to nearby countries, at least one to the Netherlands, one to France and one to Belgium.

Second-generation Preludes were modified by another German company; some 100 Preludes were modified. No DOHC engine-equipped models have been known to be converted into convertibles, however. Three versions were available: a basic version, one which had more luxurious options, and one which added a body kit.

There is believed to be a few third-generation Preludes made however it is not confirmed how many were made. There is currently one confirmed Japanese imported third generation convertible Prelude currently in Australia though not much is known of its history.

Of the fourth-generation Preludes, only some 15 were modified into a convertible by German company Honda-Autohaus Manfred Ernst. No details are known about the engine types and other specifics. Since only 15 were ever made, they are assumed by many to be custom-built.

<text>Wheelchair tennis is one of the forms of tennis adapted for wheelchair users. The size of the court, net height and rackets are the same, but there are two major differences from pedestrian tennis: athletes use specially designed wheelchairs, and the ball may bounce up to two times, where the second bounce may also occur outside the court.

Wheelchair tennis has been played at all four Grand Slams since 2007 and is one of the sports played at the Summer Paralympics. There are three categories, Men, Women, and Quads; each category has singles and doubles tournaments. The Quad, the newest division, is for players that have substantial loss of function in at least one upper limb, but may include various disabilities besides quadriplegia. The division is sometimes called Mixed, especially at the Paralympic Games. Quad players often tape the rackets to their hand, to compensate for loss of function, and some players are allowed to use electric-powered wheelchairs.

==History==
Wheelchair tennis increased in popularity in 1976 due to the efforts of Brad Parks, who is seen as the creator of competitive wheelchair tennis. In 1982, France became the first country in Europe to put a wheelchair tennis program in place. Since then, much effort has been made to promote the sport at the elite-level.

The sport quickly became popular worldwide and was introduced to the Paralympic Games as a demonstration event at the Seoul 1988 Summer Paralympics. In 1990, wheelchair tennis was played alongside the able-bodied players&#x27; event in Miami. This continued for more than 15 years. It was at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona that wheelchair tennis acquired the status of a full-fledged competition. The 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney boosted public appreciation immensely and led to the introduction of the sport to the four annual Grand Slams of Tennis. In 2004, after the efforts of Rick Draney, the Quad category was added to the Paralympic Games.

The wheelchair tennis class 8s at the 2002 Australian Open saw competitive wheelchair tennis take place at the same time and the same venue at a Grand Slam for the first time. In 2005 the Masters series was created, comprising all the events at the Grand Slams and the end of year championships, as Wimbledon and the US Open joined Melbourne. In 2007 Roland Garros joined and the Classic 8s were replaced by the Australian Open which had been held at the same venue two weeks later. In 2009 all events played at the able-bodied players&#x27; Grand Slams were renamed Grand Slams.

The Netherlands has dominated, with numerous victories at major tournaments including the Paralympic Games and the Grand Slams.

Esther Vergeer holds the record for winning four Paralympic gold medals – one each at the 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 Games. She holds the record for most consecutive wheelchair single matches won.

For the 2013 season the ITF decided to adopt match tiebreakers in place of a third and deciding set in doubles matches. However the tiebreaker would only be used at events which were rated as ITF1 or lower and at the World Team Cup. The grand slams, however, were free to decide on the format of their tournaments.

== Major tournaments ==
The ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour consists of international tournaments with different grades and prize money. The wheelchair tennis tournaments are graded by the ITF. Total prize money for the tour in 2016 was over $2million. The wheelchair tennis tour includes the following types of tournaments:
* Grand Slams
* Masters
* ITF Super Series
* ITF 1 Series
* ITF 2 Series
* ITF 3 Series
* ITF Futures Series

The four Grand Slams – Australian Open, Wimbledon, Roland Garros, and US Open – include a wheelchair tennis draw. Until 2018, only the US Open and Australian Open offered a quad draw. Only four Quad players are invited (as opposed to eight for men and women). In 2018, a Quad Wheelchair Doubles Exhibition match was played at Wimbledon. Later that year, it was announced that Wimbledon would offer a quad draw in both singles and doubles, starting in 2019. On early February 2019, Roland Garros announced that on the same year, its competition would start including wheelchair quads draws.

The Super Series events include the Bendigo Open (Bendigo), Cajun Classic (Baton Rouge), British Open (Nottingham), Japan Open (Tokyo), US Open USTA Championships (St. Louis) and Open de France (Paris). The ITF publishes a year-long calendar with all tournaments and their respective grades.

The ITF BNP Paribas World Team Cup is a wheelchair tennis tournament for national teams, held annually since 1985. The BNP Paribas World Team Cup World Group event is played once a year, for men, women, quads and juniors. There are four continental qualification events in Europe, Africa, Asia and Americas, in which men and women compete to qualify for the main event.

The last two major tournaments of the year are the Wheelchair Tennis Masters (singles event) and Uniqlo Wheelchair Doubles Masters. The top eight men, top eight women and top six quads based on ranking are invited to compete there each year.

Wheelchair tennis is played at the Paralympic Games and FESPIC games as well.

<doc id="432891" wikidata="Q213136" url="?curid=432891" title="LithTech">
<text>LithTech is a game engine developed by Monolith Productions and comparable with the Quake and Unreal engines. Monolith and a number of other video game developers have used LithTech as the basis for their first-person shooter games.

Monolith initially developed the engine for Microsoft before purchasing the rights to it and licensing it to other developers via subsidiary LithTech Inc. The licensing company was renamed to Touchdown Entertainment in 2003 and later absorbed into Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment after its acquisition of Monolith.

The last version of LithTech offered for licensing was Jupiter EX, initially released in 2005, however Monolith has continued to use LithTech technology in their games, including &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&quot;, released in 2014.

After the release of &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&quot;, the studio started working on a new engine (based on LithTech technology) for larger-scale battles called &quot;Firebird&quot;.

==Versions==
===LithTech 1.0===
Originally the LithTech engine was supposed to be called DirectEngine, as Monolith was developing it for Microsoft to be included as a 3D engine for use with Microsoft&#x27;s DirectX technology. When Microsoft decided not to use the engine Monolith bought back the rights to it and continued development on their own. They changed the engine&#x27;s name to Lithtech and licensed it to other companies. In the following years, the LithTech team was split off into a separate company, LithTech Inc., which was renamed Touchdown Entertainment in March 2003. In 2024 the Monolith website christened this incarnation as V1.

===LithTech 2.0===
Starting with LithTech 2.0, LithTech Inc. began the process of creating many different versions of the engine. Monolith released their game &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot; (NOLF) featuring this version of the engine, however it was later revised to &quot;LithTech 2.2&quot;. The game received an upgrade to LithTech 2.2 in a patch release. The LithTech team then continued to improve version 2.2 for its licensees, resulting in the 2.3 and 2.4 iterations.

LithTech cooperated with RealNetworks in developing a custom version of LithTech 2.2 called &quot;RealArcade LithTech&quot; (or LithTech ESD). Among its features it supported streaming media for in-game billboards/ads, and could be used with RealNetworks&#x27; gaming site. At one time, RealArcade LithTech could be licensed by developers if they signed an agreement with RealNetworks. This engine was used on an internally developed title, &quot;Tex Atomic&#x27;s Big Bot Battles&quot;. In 2024 the Monolith website christened this incarnation as V2, and seemingly lumps in Talon.

===LithTech Talon===
LithTech Inc. developed a different engine specifically for Monolith&#x27;s title, &quot;Aliens versus Predator 2&quot;. &quot;LithTech Talon&quot; was based on LithTech 2.2, rather than LithTech 2.4. Because of this choice, LithTech 2.4, RealArcade LithTech, and LithTech Talon became largely incompatible with each other. However, reviewers still thought of it as inferior to Unreal or id Tech.

LithTech Talon&#x27;s biggest selling point lay in its capable multiplayer support, more efficient when compared to prior versions of LithTech multiplayer that featured poor networking code. &quot;Aliens versus Predator 2&quot; features comprehensive multiplayer gameplay utilizing these improvements.

By 2003, Talon was still being licensed.

===LithTech 3.0===
LithTech 3.0 was being developed concurrently with Talon, but, along with its revisions, LithTech 3.x would largely be considered an internal version of the engine. While it was sent to licensees, no games were finished on it. The primary feature announced for LithTech 3.x was the Distributed Object System, a new system for MMORPGs and multiplayer. Unfortunately, LithTech 3.x was also plagued by a significant number of bugs and problems and all games developed with LithTech 3.x would eventually convert to the newer LithTech Jupiter or to Talon. 

The unreleased Monolith game &quot;Shogo II&quot; was being developed with this iteration of the LithTech engine.

===LithTech Discovery===
&quot;LithTech Discovery&quot; was created with the MMORPG genre and its unique requirements in mind. Discovery improved upon the working technology from LithTech 2.2, but also included the Distributed Object System which was the centerpiece of LithTech 3.x. The only game title to be powered by LithTech Discovery was &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; by Monolith. The engine was never licensed to any other company.

===LithTech Jupiter===
LithTech Jupiter was a thorough overhaul of the LithTech technology, developed as an alternative to 3.x. In some ways, the original version of Jupiter was even more technologically advanced than its competitors, since it supported Shader Model 1.x and included a visualization tool, whereas at the time Unreal and Quake only supported CPU-based shaders.

A custom version of Jupiter was made especially for Monolith, for use with their &quot;Tron 2.0&quot; game; this release was codenamed &quot;LithTech Triton&quot;. Eventually, LithTech Triton&#x27;s new features were merged back into LithTech Jupiter for licensees. In 2024 the Monolith website christened this incarnation as V3, with no mention of 3.0 or Discovery.

===LithTech Jupiter EX===
As of 2005 the latest public iteration of the LithTech engine was &quot;Jupiter Extended&quot; (or Jupiter EX), which was featured in &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; and &quot;&quot;, both developed by Monolith. Compared to its precursor Jupiter, the Extended version was driven by a new DirectX 9 renderer and other advancements, including the addition of Havok physics software for improved real-world physics simulation, dynamic per-pixel lighting, bump mapping, normal mapping, and specular highlighting. Along with Havok&#x27;s character dynamics, Jupiter EX also includes the &quot;Havok Vehicle Kit&quot;, which adds support for common vehicle behavior. In 2024 the Monolith website christened this incarnation as V4 for the initial releases, and V5 for &quot;F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin&quot; and &quot;Condemned 2: Bloodshot&quot;.

===LithTech Firebird===
&quot;Firebird&quot; was created with purpose of larger-scale battles and the expansion of the Nemesis system for &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot;. In 2024 the Monolith website christened this incarnation as V7, with the engine used in &quot;Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor&quot; titled V6.

<text>The People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (, abbreviated as ERP) was the military branch of the communist Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Party (, PRT) in Argentina.

==History==
===Origins===

The ERP was founded as the armed wing of the PRT, a communist party emerging from the Trotskyist tradition, but soon turned to the Maoist theory, especially the Cultural Revolution. During the 1960s, the PRT adopted the &quot;foquista&quot; strategy of guerilla warfare associated with Che Guevara, who had fought alongside Fidel Castro during the Cuban Revolution.

The ERP launched its guerrilla campaign against the Argentine military dictatorship headed by Juan Carlos Onganía in 1969, using targeted urban guerrilla warfare methods such as assassinations and kidnappings of government officials and foreign company executives. For example, in 1973 Enrique Gorriarán Merlo and Benito Urteaga led the ERP kidnapping of Esso executive Victor Samuelson and obtaining a ransom of $12 million. They also assaulted several companies&#x27; offices using heavily armed commandos of the ERP&#x27;s elite &quot;Special Squad&quot;. Although claim and counter-claim are invariably difficult to reconcile, figures released for an official publication, &quot;Crónica de la subversión en la Argentina&quot; (Buenos Aires: Ediciones Depalma) at least give an indication of the kind of guerrilla activity undertaken, with claims that the rural guerrillas occupied 52 towns, robbed 166 banks and took US$76 million in ransoms for the kidnappings of 185 people.

The group continued the violent campaign even after democratic elections and the return to civilian rule in 1973, with Juan Peron&#x27;s return. On 20 June 1973 the Peronist movement split after the Ezeiza massacre, that started when Lieutenant-Colonel Jorge Osinde&#x27;s crowd monitoring right-wing Peronist militia reported the arrival of heavily armed Montoneros in two buses the day that Peron returned from exile. Victor E. Samuelson, an Exxon executive, was abducted on 6 December 1973 by the ERP. He was released after 144 days in captivity, after the Exxon Corporation paid a record ransom of $14.2 million. The avowed aim of the ERP was a communist revolution against the Argentine government in pursuit of &quot;proletarian rule.&quot;

The ERP publicly remained in the forefront. ERP guerrilla activity took the form of attacks on military outposts, police stations and convoys. In 1971, 57 policemen were killed fighting the left-wing guerrillas, and in 1972 another 38 policemen lost their lives in the guerrilla violence. 
On 17 March 1972, ERP gunmen kill Lieutenant-Colonel Pedro Agarotti from the National Gendarmerie while he tended his garden on his day-off from duties. On 20 March, ERP guerrillas set fire to a number of police vehicles undergoing maintenance in a garage repair shop in the suburb of Villa Devoto in Buenos Aires. On 28 December 1972, Marine Private Julio César Provenzano of the ERP, is killed when the bomb he planted in one of the lavatories of the Argentine Naval Headquarters went off prematurely. On 23 May 1973, two Ford executives (Luis Giovanelli, manager of Ford&#x27;s analysis department and Noemi Baruj de la Rin, supervisor of industrial relations )were wounded and hospitalized after their cars and several other executives were stopped near the entrance of a number of Ford plants and their cars shot-up with sub-machine‐gun fire by masked ERP gunmen. On 3 April 1973, ERP guerrillas kidnapped Rear-Admiral Francisco Agustín Alemán.

In January 1974 the ERP &quot;Compañía Héroes de Trelew&quot;, named in commemoration of the 1972 Massacre of Trelew, during which 16 left-wing guerrillas who had attempted to escape detention had been shot dead, attacked the barracks at Azul, killing the Commanding Officer (Colonel Camilo Arturo Gay) and his wife (Hilda Irma Casaux) and kidnapping and later executing Lieutenant-Colonel Jorge Ibarzábal, with Patricia Gay the daughter of Gay and Casaux later taking her own life. However, in August, an assault on the Argentine Army&#x27;s Villa Maria explosives factory in Cordoba and the 17th Airborne Infantry Regiment at Catamarca by 70 ERP guerrillas dressed in army fatigues, met mixed fortune after killing and wounding eight policemen and soldiers but losing 16 guerrillas shot dead after they surrendered to 300 paratroopers of the 17th Airborne Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant-Colonel Eduardo Humberto Cubas. During the attack in Villa Maria was kidnapped Colonel Argentino del Valle Larraburu. On 23 October 1974, ERP guerrillas shot and killed Lieutenant-Colonel José Francisco Gardón as he was leaving the Buenos Aires hospital where he specialized in blood diseases. On 18 August 1975 Captain Miguel Alberto Keller, accompanied by an NCO and five conscripts were forced to stop their army lorry at what they believed to be a military checkpoint, and Keller was shot dead as he approached the ERP guerrillas waiting in ambush. In December 1975 a force of some 300 ERP guerrillas and supporting militants attacked the Monte Chingolo barracks outside Buenos Aires but lost 63 dead, many of whom were wounded in the attack and subsequently killed. In addition, seven army troops and three policemen were killed and 34 wounded (including 17 policemen). In all, 293 Argentine servicemen and police were killed fighting left-wing guerrillas between 1975 and 1976.
In 1976 there had been plans to send a large part of the Uruguayan &quot;Tupamaros&quot; (MLN-T), the Chilean &quot;Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria&quot; (MIR) and the Bolivian &quot;National Liberation Army&quot; (ELN) to fight alongside the ERP and Montoneros in Argentina, but the plans failed to materialize largely due to the military coup.

===Operations in Tucumán and Buenos Aires===

After the return of Juan Perón to the presidency in 1973, the ERP shifted to a rural strategy designed to secure a large land area as a base of military operations against the Argentine state. The ERP leadership chose to send the &quot;Compania del Monte Ramón Rosa Jimenez&quot; (Ramón Rosa Jimenez Mountain Company) to the province of Tucumán at the edge of the long-impoverished Andean highlands in the northwest corner of Argentina. Many of the officers in the rural &quot;guerrilleros&quot; company were trained in Cuba.

In July 2008, Cuban leader Fidel Castro admitted that he supported the guerrilla forces in South America: &quot;The only place where we didn&#x27;t attempt to promote a revolution was in Mexico. Everywhere else, without exception, we tried&quot;. Politician Gustavo Breide Obeid, who fought as an army captain against ERP guerrillas in Tucumán Province, claimed in 2007 that mercenaries from Jordan, Nicaragua and Angola served in the &#x27;Ramón Rosa Jimenez&#x27; Mountain Company. By December 1974, the guerrillas numbered about 100 fighters, with a 400-person support network from the Montoneros. Led by Mario Roberto Santucho, they soon established control over a third of the province and organized a base of some 2,500 sympathizers.

Santucho&#x27;s armed guerrillas in the northwestern province of Tucuman never exceeded 300 in the first year of the campaign.

The growth in ERP strength in the northwest, together with an increase in urban violence carried out by the left-Peronist Montoneros following Perón&#x27;s death in 1974, led the government of Isabel Perón to issue &quot;annihilation decrees&quot; and expand the military&#x27;s powers to fight a counter-insurgency campaign in February 1975. In all, 83 servicemen and policemen were killed in fighting the left-wing guerrillas, between 1973 and 1974.

Some 3,500 soldiers of the 5th Mountain Infantry Brigade, and two companies of elite commandos, placed under the command of Brigadier-General Acdel Vilas began immediately deploying in the Tucumán mountains in &quot;Operacion Independencia&quot;, joined later by 1,500 more troops from the 4th Airborne Infantry Brigade and 8th Mountain Infantry Brigade. The pattern of the war was largely dictated by the nature of the terrain, the mountains, rivers and extensive jungle denying both sides easy movement. The A-4B Skyhawk fighters and B.62 Canberra bombers of the Argentine Air Force were used for offensive air support while the North American T-34 and FMA IA 58 Pucará served as a light ground-attack and reconnaissance aircraft. While fighting the guerrilla in the jungle and mountains, Vilas concentrated on uprooting the ERP support network in the towns, using state terror tactics later adopted nationwide during the &quot;Dirty War&quot;, as well as a civic action campaign. By July, the Argentine Army commandos were mounting search-and-destroy missions. The Army special forces discovered Santucho&#x27;s base camp in August, then raided the ERP urban headquarters in September. Most of the &quot;Compania del Monte&#x27;s&quot; headquarters staff was killed in October and the remainder dispersed by the end of the year. While most of the leaders of the movement were killed outright, many of the captured ERP subalterns and sympathizers were incarcerated during the government of Isabel Perón, but little mercy was shown to captured guerrillas and civilian collaborators during the military dictatorship.
In May 1975, ERP representative Amilcar Santucho was captured trying to cross into Paraguay to promote the JCR unity effort. As a way to save himself, he provided information about the organization to Secretaría de Inteligencia (SIDE) agents that enabled Argentine security agencies to destroy what was left of the ERP, although pockets of ERP guerrillas continued to operate in the heavily wooded Tucuman mountains for many months. The case, during which an FBI official transmitted information obtained from the prisoners (Amilcar was detained along with a MIR member) to the Chilean DINA, was one practical operation of Operation Condor, which had started in 1973

Meanwhile, the guerrilla movement switched its main effort to the north and on 5 October 1975 guerrillas struck the 29th Mountain Infantry Regiment. The 5th Brigade suffered a major blow at the hands of &quot;Montoneros&quot;, when over one-hundred—perhaps several hundred—Montoneros guerrillas and &quot;milicianos&quot; (militants) were involved in the planning and execution of the most elaborate Montoneros operation in the so-called &quot;Dirty War&quot;, which involved the hijacking of a civilian airliner, taking over the provincial airport, attacking the 29th Infantry Regiment&#x27;s barracks at Formosa province and capturing its cache of arms, and finally escaping by air. Once the operation was over, they made good their escape towards a remote area in Santa Fe province. The aircraft, a Boeing 737, eventually landed on a crop field not far from the city of Rafaela. In the aftermath, 12 soldiers and 2 policemen were killed and several wounded. The sophistication of the operation, and the getaway cars and safehouses they used to escape from the crash-landing site, suggest several hundred guerrillas and their civilian supporters were involved.

In December 1975 most 5th Brigade units were committed to the border areas of Tucumán with over 5,000 troops deployed in the province. There was however, nothing to prevent infiltrating through this outer ring and the ERP were still strong inside Buenos Aires. Mario Santucho&#x27;s Christmas offensive opened on 23 December 1975. The operation was dramatic in its impact, with ERP units, supported by &quot;Montoneros&quot;, mounting a large scale assault against the army supply base &quot;Domingo Viejobueno&quot; at the industrial suburb of Monte Chingolo, south of Buenos Aires. The attackers were defeated and driven off with 53 ERP guerrillas and 9 supporting militants killed. Seven army troops and three policemen were reported killed. In this particular battle the ERP and supporting Montoneros militants had about 1,000 deployed against 1,000 government forces. This large-scale operation was made possible not only by the planning of the guerrillas involved, but also by their supporters who provided houses to hide them, supplies and the means of escape.

On 30 December a bomb exploded at the headquarters of the Argentine Army in Buenos Aires, injuring at least six soldiers. In the eyes of the military, the credibility of the government was now destroyed and the strategy of attrition was bankrupt. The guerrillas had even successfully utilized divers of the Grupo Especial de Combate of the Montoneros: the modern type 42 destroyer was severely damaged by explosives placed under her keel by frogmen of the Montoneros on 22 August 1975 while moored in the port of Ensenada. The damage was so great that the ship remained unseaworthy for several years. By the end of 1975, a total of 137 servicemen and police had been killed that year by left wing guerrillas. Elements within the armed forces, particularly among the junior officers, blamed the weakness of the government and began to seek a leader who they considered was strong enough to ensure a preservation of Argentinian sovereignty, settling on Lieutenant-General Jorge Videla. On 11 February 1976, colonel Raúl Rafael Reyes, the commander of the 601st Air Defence Artillery Group, was killed and two army conscripts (Privates Tempone and Gómez) wounded in an ambush by six ERP guerrillas in the La Plata suburb of Buenos Aires. 

The Argentine armed forces moved ahead with the &quot;Dirty War&quot;, dispensing with the civilian government through a coup d&#x27;état in March 1976. In his editorial immediately after the military takeover, Santucho wrote that &quot;a river of blood will separate the military from the Argentine people&quot;, and this would result in a popular uprising followed by a civil war. On 29 March 1976, the ERP leadership lost twelve killed in a gun battle in downtown Buenos Aires with army elements (including the ERP Chief of Intelligence) but Santucho along with fifty guerrillas were able to fight their way out of the ambush. The Argentine Army and police scored more success in mid-April in Córdoba, when in a series of raids it captured and later killed some 300 militants entrusted with supporting the ERP operations in that province. During the first few months of the military junta, more than 70 policemen were killed in leftist actions In mid-1976, the Argentine Army completely destroyed the ERP&#x27;s elite &quot;Special Squad&quot; in two violent firefights. The ERP&#x27;s commander, Mario Roberto Santucho, and Benito Urteaga were killed in July of that year by military forces led by captain Juan Carlos Leonetti of the 601st Intelligence Battalion. Several hundred guerrillas of the Guevarist Youth Group in training for operations to coincide with the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, were captured and killed in a series of raids in Zárate soon afterwards. Although the ERP continued for a while under the leadership of Enrique Gorriarán Merlo, by late 1977 the guerrilla threat had been eradicated or gone underground. In 2008, the PRT-ERP reported the loss of 5,000 of its members killed in action or having disappeared after being detained. By that time the military dictatorship had expanded its own campaign against &quot;subversives&quot; to include state terror against active civilian collaborators, non-violent students, intellectuals, and political activists who were presumed to form the social, non-combatant base of the insurgents. According to different sources, 12,261 to 30,000 people, are estimated to have disappeared and died during the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. Admittedly there were 12,000 disappeared in the form of PEN detainees that survived the dictatorship, thanks to international pressure to release them from the clandestine detention camps. Terence Roehrig, in his book The Prosecution of Former Military Leaders in Newly Democratic Nations: The Cases of Argentina, Greece, and South Korea (Pg 42, McFarland &amp; Company, 2001), estimates that of the disappeared in Argentina &quot;at least 10,000 were involved in various ways with the guerrillas&quot;. Some 11,000 Argentines have applied for and received up to US$200,000 each as monetary compensation for the loss of loved ones during the military dictatorship.
The PRT continued political activities, although limited to few members, organizing conventions even after democracy returned to the country. In December 2015, Professor Gustavo Morello (SJ) in his book &quot;The Catholic Church and Argentina&#x27;s Dirty War&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2015) concluded that during the &quot;Dirty War&quot; in Argentina &quot;15,000 people were killed, 8,000 were jailed and some 6,000 were exiled.&quot;

===Aftermath===
After the destruction of the left-wing in Argentina, some revolutionary cadres made their way to Nicaragua, where the Sandinistas had taken power in 1979. An ERP commando team comprising veterans of the &quot;Dirty War&quot; under Gorriarán Merlo, for example, demonstrated their active involvement in the revolutionary struggle by killing ex-dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1980. Gorriarán returned to Argentina in 1987 to become a leader of the &quot;Movimiento Todos por la Patria&quot; (All For the Motherland Movement or MTP).

Claiming another military coup by the &quot;Carapintadas&quot; was imminent against the new democratic government of Raúl Alfonsín (which at the time was leading a series of trials against members of the Argentine Military accused of human rights violations), Enrique Gorriarán Merlo led the 1989 attack on La Tablada Regiment, during which the Argentine army used white phosphorus as an anti-personnel weapon, and in which the guerrillas used captured army conscripts as &#x27;shields&#x27; and ended in the capture of the surviving MTP members. Alfonsín countered the claim that the MTP were trying to forestall a military coup and declared that the attack had the ultimate goal of sparking a massive popular uprising, that could have led to civil war. In their newspapers and in the Argentine press, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo denounced the way Alfonsín had handled the La Tablada incident, making a connection between what had happened to their disappeared children and the treatment endured by the MTP guerrillas. Gorriarán was given a life sentence along with other MTP comrades, but was freed by interim president Eduardo Duhalde two days before Néstor Kirchner&#x27;s access to power in 2003. In protest to Duhalde&#x27;s decision, former Lieutenant-Colonel Emilio Guillermo Nani who took part in the fighting to recover the La Tablada barracks and lost an eye as a consequence, formally announced that he would be returning the medal for wounded military personnel that he won during the administration of Argentine president Raúl Alfonsín. The MTP still exist today as a political movement which has abandoned armed struggle.

In January 2016 for the first time in decades, Mauricio Macri (the previous president of Argentina) through the new Human Rights Secretary Claudio Avruj, granted an audience to CELTYV (Centre for Legal Studies on Terrorism and its Victims) representing the victims of left-wing terrorism in Argentina in a move that drew strong condemnation from Estela Barnes de Carlotto, head of the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo.

<text>Bartolomeo Pagano (27 September 1878 – 24 June 1947) was an Italian motion picture actor.

Before his cinema career, Pagano was a stevedore who worked at the port of Genoa. There, he was discovered and selected to play the role of Maciste, a muscular slave, in the silent movie classic &quot;Cabiria&quot; in 1914. As the originator of this role, he went on to play the character for the next 14 years in a series of sequels. Pagano became an international star, and legally changed his name to Maciste. In the 1920s he was one of the most well paid actors in Italy, receiving up to 600.000 lire a year. The actor retired from films in 1929 to marry and raise a family in his home town of Genoa. He died there, aged 68, and is buried on the family estate in Italy.

<text>A mechanical calculator, or calculating machine, is a mechanical device used to perform the basic operations of arithmetic automatically, or (historically) a simulation such as an analog computer or a slide rule. Most mechanical calculators were comparable in size to small desktop computers and have been rendered obsolete by the advent of the electronic calculator and the digital computer.

Surviving notes from Wilhelm Schickard in 1623 reveal that he designed and had built the earliest (known) apparatus fulfilling the widely accepted definition of a mechanical calculator (= &quot;counting machine with an automated tens-carry&quot;). His machine was composed of two sets of technologies: first an abacus made of Napier&#x27;s bones, to simplify multiplications and divisions first described six years earlier in 1617, and for the mechanical part, it had a dialed pedometer to perform additions and subtractions. A study of the surviving notes shows a machine that could have jammed after a few entries on the same dial. argued that it could be damaged if a carry had to be propagated over a few digits (like adding 1 to 999), but further study and working replicas refute this claim.
Schickard tried to build a second machine for the astronomer Johannes Kepler, but could not complete it. During the turmoil of the 30-year-war his machine was burned, Schickard died of the plague in 1635.

Two decades after Schickard, in 1642, Blaise Pascal invented another mechanical calculator with better (but still not perfect) tens-carry. Co-opted into his father&#x27;s labour as tax collector in Rouen, Pascal designed the calculator to help in the large amount of tedious arithmetic required; it was called Pascal&#x27;s Calculator or Pascaline.

In 1672, Gottfried Leibniz started designing an entirely new machine called the Stepped Reckoner. It used a stepped drum, built by and named after him, the Leibniz wheel, was the first two-motion calculator, the first to use cursors (creating a memory of the first operand) and the first to have a movable carriage. Leibniz built two Stepped Reckoners, one in 1694 and one in 1706. The Leibniz wheel was used in many calculating machines for 200 years, and into the 1970s with the Curta hand calculator, until the advent of the electronic calculator in the mid-1970s. Leibniz was also the first to promote the idea of an Pinwheel calculator.

During the 18th century some Inventors in Europe were working on mechanical calculators for all 4 species. Philipp Matthäus Hahn, Johann Helfreich Müller and others constructed machines that were working flawless, but due to the enormous amount of manual work and high precision needed for these machines they remained singletons and stayed mostly in cabinets of couriosity of their respective rulers. Only Müller&#x27;s machine from 1783 was put to use (compilation of tables of lumber prices) before it came into possession of the landgrave in Darmstadt.

Thomas&#x27; arithmometer, the first commercially successful machine, was manufactured in 1851; it was the first mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. For forty years the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator available for sale until the industrial production of the more successful Odhner Arithmometer in 1890.

The comptometer, introduced in 1887, was the first machine to use a keyboard that consisted of columns of nine keys (from 1 to 9) for each digit. The Dalton adding machine, manufactured in 1902, was the first to have a 10 key keyboard. Electric motors were used on some mechanical calculators from 1901. In 1961, a comptometer type machine, the Anita Mk VII from Sumlock comptometer Ltd., became the first desktop mechanical calculator to receive an all-electronic calculator engine, creating the link in between these two industries and marking the beginning of its decline. The production of mechanical calculators came to a stop in the middle of the 1970s closing an industry that had lasted for 120 years.

Charles Babbage designed two new kinds of mechanical calculators, which were so big that they required the power of a steam engine to operate, and that were too sophisticated to be built in his lifetime. The first one was an &quot;automatic&quot; mechanical calculator, his difference engine, which could automatically compute and print mathematical tables. In 1855, Georg Scheutz became the first of a handful of designers to succeed at building a smaller and simpler model of his difference engine. The second one was a &quot;programmable&quot; mechanical calculator, his analytical engine, which Babbage started to design in 1834; &quot;in less than two years he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer. A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom&quot; making it infinitely programmable. In 1937, Howard Aiken convinced IBM to design and build the ASCC/Mark I, the first machine of its kind, based on the architecture of the analytical engine; when the machine was finished some hailed it as &quot;Babbage&#x27;s dream come true&quot;.

==Ancient history==


A short list of other precursors to the mechanical calculator must include a group of mechanical analog computers which, once set, are only modified by the continuous and repeated action of their actuators (crank handle, weight, wheel, water...). Before the common era, there are odometers and the Antikythera mechanism, a seemingly out of place, unique, geared astronomical clock, followed more than a millennium later by early mechanical clocks, geared astrolabes and followed in the 15th century by pedometers. These machines were all made of toothed gears linked by some sort of carry mechanisms. These machines always produce identical results for identical initial settings unlike a mechanical calculator where all the wheels are independent but are also linked together by the rules of arithmetic.

==The 17th century==

===Overview===
The 17th century marked the beginning of the history of mechanical calculators, as it saw the invention of its first machines, including Pascal&#x27;s calculator, in 1642. Blaise Pascal had invented a machine which he presented as being able to perform computations that were previously thought to be only humanly possible.

The 17th century also saw the invention of some very powerful tools to aid arithmetic calculations like Napier&#x27;s bones, logarithmic tables and the slide rule which, for their ease of use by scientists in multiplying and dividing, ruled over and impeded the use and development of mechanical calculators until the production release of the arithmometer in the mid 19th century.
===Invention of the mechanical calculator===

In 1623 and 1624 Wilhelm Schickard, in two letters that he sent to Johannes Kepler, reported his design and construction of what he referred to as an “arithmeticum organum” (“arithmetical instrument”), which would later be described as a Rechenuhr (calculating clock). The machine was designed to assist in all the four basic functions of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). Amongst its uses, Schickard suggested it would help in the laborious task of calculating astronomical tables. The machine could add and subtract six-digit numbers, and indicated an overflow of this capacity by ringing a bell. The adding machine in the base was primarily provided to assist in the difficult task of adding or multiplying two multi-digit numbers. To this end an ingenious arrangement of rotatable Napier&#x27;s bones were mounted on it. It even had an additional &quot;memory register&quot; to record intermediate calculations. Whilst Schickard noted that the adding machine was working, his letters mention that he had asked a professional, a clockmaker named Johann Pfister, to build a finished machine. Regrettably it was destroyed in a fire either whilst still incomplete, or in any case before delivery. Schickard abandoned his project soon after. He and his entire family were wiped out in 1635 by bubonic plague during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Schickard&#x27;s machine used clock wheels which were made stronger and were therefore heavier, to prevent them from being damaged by the force of an operator input. Each digit used a display wheel, an input wheel and an intermediate wheel. During a carry transfer all these wheels meshed with the wheels of the digit receiving the carry.

Blaise Pascal invented a mechanical calculator with a sophisticated carry mechanism in 1642. After three years of effort and 50 prototypes he introduced his calculator to the public. He built twenty of these machines in the following ten years. This machine could add and subtract two numbers directly and multiply and divide by repetition. Since, unlike Schickard&#x27;s machine, the Pascaline dials could only rotate in one direction zeroing it after each calculation required the operator to dial in all 9s and then (method of) propagate a carry right through the machine. This suggests that the carry mechanism would have proved itself in practice many times over. This is a testament to the quality of the Pascaline because none of the 17th and 18th century criticisms of the machine mentioned a problem with the carry mechanism and yet it was fully tested on all the machines, by their resets, all the time.


In 1672, Gottfried Leibniz started working on adding direct multiplication to what he understood was the working of Pascal&#x27;s calculator. However, it is doubtful that he had ever fully seen the mechanism and the method could not have worked because of the lack of reversible rotation in the mechanism. Accordingly, he eventually designed an entirely new machine called the Stepped Reckoner; it used his Leibniz wheels, was the first two-motion calculator, the first to use cursors (creating a memory of the first operand) and the first to have a movable carriage. Leibniz built two Stepped Reckoners, one in 1694 and one in 1706. Only the machine built in 1694 is known to exist; it was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century having been forgotten in an attic in the University of Göttingen.

Leibniz had invented his namesake wheel and the principle of a two-motion calculator, but after forty years of development he wasn&#x27;t able to produce a machine that was fully operational; this makes Pascal&#x27;s calculator the only working mechanical calculator in the 17th century. Leibniz was also the first person to describe a pinwheel calculator. He once said &quot;It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used.&quot;

===Other calculating machines===
Schickard, Pascal and Leibniz were inevitably inspired by the role of clockwork which was highly celebrated in the seventeenth century. However, simple-minded application of interlinked gears was insufficient for any of their purposes. Schickard introduced the use of a single toothed &quot;mutilated gear&quot; to enable the carry to take place. Pascal improved on that with his famous weighted sautoir. Leibniz went even further in relation to the ability to use a moveable carriage to perform multiplication more efficiently, albeit at the expense of a fully working carry mechanism.

The principle of the clock (input wheels and display wheels added to a clock like mechanism) for a direct-entry calculating machine couldn&#x27;t be implemented to create a fully effective calculating machine without additional innovation with the technological capabilities of the 17th century. because their gears would jam when a carry had to be moved several places along the accumulator. The only 17th-century calculating clocks that have survived to this day do not have a machine-wide carry mechanism and therefore cannot be called fully effective mechanical calculators. A much more successful calculating clock was built by the Italian Giovanni Poleni in the 18th century and was a two-motion calculating clock (the numbers are inscribed first and then they are processed).

* In 1623, Wilhelm Schickard, a German professor of Hebrew and Astronomy, designed a calculating clock which he drew on two letters that he wrote to Johannes Kepler. The first machine to be built by a professional was destroyed during its construction and Schickard abandoned his project in 1624. These drawings had appeared in various publications over the centuries, starting in 1718 with a book of Kepler&#x27;s letters by Michael Hansch, but in 1957 it was presented for the first time as a long-lost mechanical calculator by Dr. Franz Hammer. The building of the first replica in the 1960s showed that Schickard&#x27;s machine had an unfinished design and therefore wheels and springs were added to make it work. The use of these replicas showed that the single-tooth wheel, when used within a calculating clock, was an inadequate carry mechanism. (see Pascal versus Schickard). This did not mean that such a machine could not be used in practice, but the operator when faced with the mechanism resisting rotation, in the unusual circumstances of a carry being required beyond (say) 3 dials, would need to &quot;help&quot; the subsequent carry to propagate.
* Around 1643, a French clockmaker from Rouen, after hearing of Pascal&#x27;s work, built what he claimed to be a calculating clock of his own design. Pascal fired all his employees and stopped developing his calculator as soon as he heard of the news. It is only after being assured that his invention would be protected by a royal privilege that he restarted his activity. A careful examination of this calculating clock showed that it didn&#x27;t work properly and Pascal called it an &quot;avorton&quot; (aborted fetus).
* In 1659, the Italian Tito Livio Burattini built a machine with nine independent wheels, each one of these wheels was paired with a smaller carry wheel. At the end of an operation the user had to either manually add each carry to the next digit or mentally add these numbers to create the final result.
* In 1666, Samuel Morland invented a machine designed to add sums of money, but it was not a true adding machine since the carry was added to a small carry wheel situated above each digit and not directly to the next digit. It was very similar to Burattini&#x27;s machine. Morland created also a multiplying machines with interchangeable disks based on Napier&#x27;s bones. Taken together these two machines provided a capacity similar to that of the invention of Schickard, although it is doubtful that Morland ever encountered Schickard&#x27;s calculating clock.
* In 1673, the French clockmaker René Grillet described in &quot;Curiositez mathématiques de l&#x27;invention du Sr Grillet, horlogeur à Paris&quot; a calculating machine that would be more compact than Pascal&#x27;s calculator and reversible for subtraction. The only two Grillet machines known have no carry mechanism, displaying three lines of nine independent dials they also have nine rotating napier&#x27;s rod for multiplication and division. Contrary to Grillet&#x27;s claim, it was not a mechanical calculator after all.

==The 18th century==
===Overview===

The 18th century saw the first mechanical calculator that could perform a multiplication automatically; designed and built by Giovanni Poleni in 1709 and made of wood, it was the first successful calculating clock. For all the machines built in this century, division still required the operator to decide when to stop a repeated subtraction at each index, and therefore these machines were only providing a help in dividing, like an abacus. Both pinwheel calculators and Leibniz wheel calculators were built with a few unsuccessful attempts at their commercialization.

===Prototypes and limited runs===

* In 1709, Italian Giovanni Poleni was the first to build a calculator that could multiply automatically. It used a pinwheel design, was the first operational &quot;calculating clock&quot; and was made of wood; he destroyed it after hearing that Antonius Braun had received 10,000 Guldens for dedicating a pinwheel machine of his own design to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in Vienna.
* In 1725, the French Academy of Sciences certified a calculating machine derived from Pascal&#x27;s calculator designed by Lépine, a French craftsman. The machine was a bridge in between Pascal&#x27;s calculator and a calculating clock. The carry transmissions were performed simultaneously, like in a calculating clock, and therefore &quot;the machine must have jammed beyond a few simultaneous carry transmissions&quot;.
* In 1727, German Anton Braun presented the first fully functional four-operation machine to Emperor Charles VI in Vienna. It was cylindrical in shape and was made of steel, silver and brass; it was finely decorated and looked like a renaissance table clock. His dedication to the emperor engraved on the top of the machine also reads &quot;...to make easy to ignorant people, addition, subtraction, multiplication and even division&quot;. 
* In 1730, the French Academy of Sciences certified three machines designed by Hillerin de Boistissandeau. The first one used a single-tooth carry mechanism which, according to Boistissandeau, wouldn&#x27;t work properly if a carry had to be moved more than two places; the two other machines used springs that were gradually armed until they released their energy when a carry had to be moved forward. It was similar to Pascal&#x27;s calculator but instead of using the energy of gravity Boistissandeau used the energy stored into the springs.
* In 1770, Philipp Matthäus Hahn, a German pastor, built two circular calculating machines based on Leibniz&#x27; cylinders. J. C. Schuster, Hahn&#x27;s brother-in-law, built a few machines of Hahn&#x27;s design into the early 19th century.
* In 1775, Lord Stanhope of the United Kingdom designed a pinwheel machine. It was set in a rectangular box with a handle on the side. He also designed a machine using Leibniz wheels in 1777. &quot;In 1777 Stanhope produced the &quot;Logic Demonstrator&quot;, a machine designed to solve problems in formal logic. This device marked the beginning of a new approach to the solution of logical problems by mechanical methods.&quot;
* In 1784, German Johann-Helfrich Müller built a machine very similar to Hahn&#x27;s machine.

==The 19th century==

===Overview===

Luigi Torchi invented the first direct multiplication machine in 1834. This was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White (1822).

The mechanical calculator industry started in 1851 Thomas de Colmar released his simplified Arithmomètre, which was the first machine that could be used daily in an office environment.

For 40 years, the arithmometer was the only mechanical calculator available for sale and was sold all over the world. By 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold plus a few hundreds more from two licensed arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany, 1878 and Layton, UK, 1883). Felt and Tarrant, the only other competitor in true commercial production, had sold 100 comptometers in three years.

The 19th century also saw the designs of Charles Babbage calculating machines, first with his difference engine, started in 1822, which was the first automatic calculator since it continuously used the results of the previous operation for the next one, and second with his analytical engine, which was the first programmable calculator, using Jacquard&#x27;s cards to read program and data, that he started in 1834, and which gave the blueprint of the mainframe computers built in the middle of the 20th century.
===Desktop calculators produced===

* In 1851, Thomas de Colmar simplified his arithmometer by removing the one-digit multiplier/divider. This made it a simple adding machine, but thanks to its moving carriage used as an indexed accumulator, it still allowed for easy multiplication and division under operator control. The arithmometer was now adapted to the manufacturing capabilities of the time; Thomas could therefore manufacture consistently a sturdy and reliable machine. Manuals were printed and each machine was given a serial number. Its commercialization launched the mechanical calculator industry. Banks, insurance companies, government offices started to use the arithmometer in their day-to-day operations, slowly bringing mechanical desktop calculators into the office.
* In 1878 Burkhardt, of Germany, was the first to manufacture a clone of Thomas&#x27; arithmometer. Until then Thomas de Colmar had been the only manufacturer of desktop mechanical calculators in the world and he had manufactured about 1,500 machines. Eventually twenty European companies will manufacture clones of Thomas&#x27; arithmometer until WWII.
* Dorr E. Felt, in the U.S., patented the Comptometer in 1886. It was the first successful key-driven adding and calculating machine. [&quot;Key-driven&quot; refers to the fact that just pressing the keys causes the result to be calculated, no separate lever or crank has to be operated. Other machines are sometimes called &quot;key-set&quot;.] In 1887, he joined with Robert Tarrant to form the Felt &amp; Tarrant Manufacturing Company. The comptometer-type calculator was the first machine to receive an all-electronic calculator engine in 1961 (the ANITA mark VII released by Sumlock comptometer of the UK).
* In 1890 W. T. Odhner got the rights to manufacture his calculator back from &quot;Königsberger &amp; C&quot;, which had held them since it was first patented in 1878, but had not really produced anything. Odhner used his Saint Petersburg workshop to manufacture his calculator and he built and sold 500 machines in 1890. This manufacturing operation shut down definitively in 1918 with 23,000 machines produced. The Odhner Arithmometer was a redesigned version of the Arithmometer of Thomas de Colmar with a pinwheel engine, which made it cheaper to manufacture and gave it a smaller footprint while keeping the advantage of having the same user interface.
* In 1892 Odhner sold the Berlin branch of his factory, which he had opened a year earlier, to &quot;Grimme, Natalis &amp; Co.&quot; They moved the factory to Braunschweig and sold their machines under the brand name of Brunsviga (Brunsviga is the Latin name of the town of Braunschweig). This was the first of many companies which would sell and manufacture clones of Odhner&#x27;s machine all over the world; eventually millions were sold well into the 1970s.
* In 1892, William S. Burroughs began commercial manufacture of his printing adding calculator Burroughs Corporation became one of the leading companies in the accounting machine and computer businesses.
* The &quot;Millionaire&quot; calculator was introduced in 1893. It allowed direct multiplication by any digit – &quot;one turn of the crank for each figure in the multiplier&quot;. It contained a mechanical product lookup table, providing units and tens digits by differing lengths of posts. Another direct multiplier was part of the Moon-Hopkins billing machine; that company was acquired by Burroughs in the early 20th century.

=== Automatic mechanical calculators ===

* In 1822, Charles Babbage presented a small cogwheel assembly that demonstrated the operation of his difference engine, a mechanical calculator which would be capable of holding and manipulating seven numbers of 31 decimal digits each. It was the first time that a calculating machine could work automatically using as input results from its previous operations. It was the first calculating machine to use a printer. The development of this machine, later called &quot;Difference Engine No. 1,&quot; stopped around 1834.
* In 1847, Babbage began work on an improved difference engine design—his &quot;Difference Engine No. 2.&quot; None of these designs were completely built by Babbage. In 1991 the London Science Museum followed Babbage&#x27;s plans to build a working Difference Engine No. 2 using the technology and materials available in the 19th century.
* In 1855, Per Georg Scheutz completed a working difference engine based on Babbage&#x27;s design. The machine was the size of a piano, and was demonstrated at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855. It was used to create tables of logarithms.
* In 1875, Martin Wiberg re-designed the Babbage/Scheutz difference engine and built a version that was the size of a sewing machine.

=== Programmable mechanical calculators ===

* In 1834, Babbage started to design his analytical engine, which will become the undisputed ancestor of the modern mainframe computer with two separate input streams for data and program (a primitive Harvard architecture), printers for outputting results (three different kind), processing unit (mill), memory (store) and the first-ever set of programming instructions. In the proposal that Howard Aiken gave IBM in 1937 while requesting funding for the Harvard Mark I which became IBM&#x27;s entry machine in the computer industry, we can read: &quot;Few calculating machines have been designed strictly for application to scientific investigations, the notable exceptions being those of Charles Babbage and others who followed him. In 1812 Babbage conceived the idea of a calculating machine of a higher type than those previously constructed to be used for calculating and printing tables of mathematical functions. ...After abandoning the &quot;difference engine&quot;, Babbage devoted his energy to the design and construction of an &quot;analytical engine&quot; of far higher powers than the &quot;difference engine&quot;...&quot;
* In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the analytical engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers. This is considered the first computer program.
* From 1872 until 1910, Henry Babbage worked intermittently on creating the mill, the &quot;central processing unit&quot; of his father&#x27;s machine. After a few setbacks, he gave in 1906 a successful demonstration of the mill which printed the first 44 multiples of pi with 29 places of figures.

=== Cash registers ===

The cash register, invented by the American saloonkeeper James Ritty in 1879, addressed the old problems of disorganization and dishonesty in business transactions. It was a pure adding machine coupled with a printer, a bell and a two-sided display that showed the paying party and the store owner, if he wanted to, the amount of money exchanged for the current transaction.

The cash register was easy to use and, unlike genuine mechanical calculators, was needed and quickly adopted by a great number of businesses. &quot;Eighty four companies sold cash registers between 1888 and 1895, only three survived for any length of time&quot;.

In 1890, 6 years after John Patterson started NCR Corporation, 20,000 machines had been sold by his company alone against a total of roughly 3,500 for all genuine calculators combined.

By 1900, NCR had built 200,000 cash registers and there were more companies manufacturing them, compared to the &quot;Thomas/Payen&quot; arithmometer company that had just sold around 3,300 and Burroughs had only sold 1,400 machines.

===Prototypes and limited runs===

* In 1820, Thomas de Colmar patented the Arithmometer. It was a true four operation machine with a one digit multiplier/divider (The &quot;Millionaire&quot; calculator released 70 years later had a similar user interface). He spent the next 30 years and 300,000 Francs developing his machine. This design was replaced in 1851 by the simplified arithmometer which was only an adding machine.
* From 1840, Didier Roth patented and built a few calculating machines, one of which was a direct descendant of Pascal&#x27;s calculator.
* In 1842, Timoleon Maurel invented the Arithmaurel, based on the Arithmometer, which could multiply two numbers by simply entering their values into the machine.
* In 1845, Izrael Abraham Staffel first exhibited a machine that was able to add, subtract, divide, multiply and obtain a square root.
* Around 1854, Andre-Michel Guerry invented the Ordonnateur Statistique, a cylindrical device designed to aid in summarizing the relations among data on moral variables (crime, suicide, etc.)
* In 1872, Frank S. Baldwin in the U.S. invented a pinwheel calculator.
* In 1877 George B. Grant of Boston in the United States began producing the Grant mechanical calculating machine capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The machine measured 13x5x7 inches and contained eighty working pieces made of brass and tempered steel. It was first introduced to the public at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.
* In 1883, Edmondson of the United Kingdom patented a circular stepped drum calculator.

==1900s to 1970s==

=== Mechanical calculators reach their zenith ===
Two different classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary. The former type of mechanism was operated typically by a limited-travel hand crank; some internal detailed operations took place on the pull, and others on the release part of a complete cycle. The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later on, some of these mechanisms were operated by electric motors and reduction gearing that operated a crank and connecting rod to convert rotary motion to reciprocating.

The latter type, rotary, had at least one main shaft that made one [or more] continuous revolution[s], one addition or subtraction per turn. Numerous designs, notably European calculators, had handcranks, and locks to ensure that the cranks were returned to exact positions once a turn was complete.

The first half of the 20th century saw the gradual development of the mechanical calculator mechanism.

The Dalton adding-listing machine introduced in 1902 was the first of its type to use only ten keys, and became the first of many different models of &quot;10-key add-listers&quot; manufactured by many companies.

In 1948 the cylindrical Curta calculator, which was compact enough to be held in one hand, was introduced after being developed by Curt Herzstark in 1938. This was an extreme development of the stepped-gear calculating mechanism. It subtracted by adding complements; between the teeth for addition were teeth for subtraction.

From the early 1900s through the 1960s, mechanical calculators dominated the desktop computing market. Major suppliers in the USA included Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. These devices were motor-driven, and had movable carriages where results of calculations were displayed by dials. Nearly all keyboards were &quot;full&quot; – each digit that could be entered had its own column of nine keys, 1..9, plus a column-clear key, permitting entry of several digits at once. (See the illustration below of a Marchant Figurematic.) One could call this parallel entry, by way of contrast with ten-key serial entry that was commonplace in mechanical adding machines, and is now universal in electronic calculators. (Nearly all Friden calculators, as well as some rotary (German) Diehls had a ten-key auxiliary keyboard for entering the multiplier when doing multiplication.) Full keyboards generally had ten columns, although some lower-cost machines had eight. Most machines made by the three companies mentioned did not print their results, although other companies, such as Olivetti, did make printing calculators.

In these machines, addition and subtraction were performed in a single operation, as on a conventional adding machine, but multiplication and division were accomplished by repeated mechanical additions and subtractions. Friden made a calculator that also provided square roots, basically by doing division, but with added mechanism that automatically incremented the number in the keyboard in a systematic fashion. The last of the mechanical calculators were likely to have short-cut multiplication, and some ten-key, serial-entry types had decimal-point keys. However, decimal-point keys required significant internal added complexity, and were offered only in the last designs to be made. Handheld mechanical calculators such as the 1948 Curta continued to be used until they were displaced by electronic calculators in the 1970s.

Typical European four-operation machines use the Odhner mechanism, or variations of it. This kind of machine included the &quot;Original Odhner&quot;, Brunsviga and several following imitators, starting from Triumphator, Thales, Walther, Facit up to Toshiba. Although most of these were operated by handcranks, there were motor-driven versions. Hamann calculators externally resembled pinwheel machines, but the setting lever positioned a cam that disengaged a drive pawl when the dial had moved far enough.

Although Dalton introduced in 1902 first 10-key printing &quot;adding&quot; (two operations, the other being subtraction) machine, these features were not present in &quot;computing&quot; (four operations) machines for many decades. Facit-T (1932) was the first 10-key computing machine sold in large numbers. Olivetti Divisumma-14 (1948) was the first computing machine with both printer and a 10-key keyboard.
Full-keyboard machines, including motor-driven ones, were also built until the 1960s. Among the major manufacturers were Mercedes-Euklid, Archimedes, and MADAS in Europe; in the USA, Friden, Marchant, and Monroe were the principal makers of rotary calculators with carriages. Reciprocating calculators (most of which were adding machines, many with integral printers) were made by Remington Rand and Burroughs, among others. All of these were key-set. Felt &amp; Tarrant made Comptometers, as well as Victor, which were key-driven.

The basic mechanism of the Friden and Monroe was a modified Leibniz wheel (better known, perhaps informally, in the USA as a &quot;stepped drum&quot; or &quot;stepped reckoner&quot;). The Friden had an elementary reversing drive between the body of the machine and the accumulator dials, so its main shaft always rotated in the same direction. The Swiss MADAS was similar. The Monroe, however, reversed direction of its main shaft to subtract.

The earliest Marchants were pinwheel machines, but most of them were remarkably sophisticated rotary types. They ran at 1,300 addition cycles per minute if the [+] bar is held down. Others were limited to 600 cycles per minute, because their accumulator dials started and stopped for every cycle; Marchant dials moved at a steady and proportional speed for continuing cycles. Most Marchants had a row of nine keys on the extreme right, as shown in the photo of the Figurematic. These simply made the machine add for the number of cycles corresponding to the number on the key, and then shifted the carriage one place. Even nine add cycles took only a short time.

In a Marchant, near the beginning of a cycle, the accumulator dials moved downward &quot;into the dip&quot;, away from the openings in the cover. They engaged drive gears in the body of the machine, which rotated them at speeds proportional to the digit being fed to them, with added movement (reduced 10:1) from carries created by dials to their right. At the completion of the cycle, the dials would be misaligned like the pointers in a traditional watt-hour meter. However, as they came up out of the dip, a constant-lead disc cam realigned them by way of a (limited-travel) spur-gear differential. As well, carries for lower orders were added in by another, planetary differential. (The machine shown has 39 differentials in its [20-digit] accumulator!)

In any mechanical calculator, in effect, a gear, sector, or some similar device moves the accumulator by the number of gear teeth that corresponds to the digit being added or subtracted – three teeth changes the position by a count of three. The great majority of basic calculator mechanisms move the accumulator by starting, then moving at a constant speed, and stopping. In particular, stopping is critical, because to obtain fast operation, the accumulator needs to move quickly. Variants of Geneva drives typically block overshoot (which, of course, would create wrong results).

However, two different basic mechanisms, the Mercedes-Euklid and the Marchant, move the dials at speeds corresponding to the digit being added or subtracted; a [1] moves the accumulator the slowest, and a [9], the fastest. In the Mercedes-Euklid, a long slotted lever, pivoted at one end, moves nine racks (&quot;straight gears&quot;) endwise by distances proportional to their distance from the lever&#x27;s pivot. Each rack has a drive pin that is moved by the slot. The rack for [1] is closest to the pivot, of course.
For each keyboard digit, a sliding selector gear, much like that in the Leibniz wheel, engages the rack that corresponds to the digit entered. Of course, the accumulator changes either on the forward or reverse stroke, but not both. This mechanism is notably simple and relatively easy to manufacture.

The Marchant, however, has, for every one of its ten columns of keys, a nine-ratio &quot;preselector transmission&quot; with its output spur gear at the top of the machine&#x27;s body; that gear engages the accumulator gearing. When one tries to work out the numbers of teeth in such a transmission, a straightforward approach leads one to consider a mechanism like that in mechanical gasoline pump registers, used to indicate the total price. However, this mechanism is seriously bulky, and utterly impractical for a calculator; 90-tooth gears are likely to be found in the gas pump. Practical gears in the computing parts of a calculator cannot have 90 teeth. They would be either too big, or too delicate.

Given that nine ratios per column implies significant complexity, a Marchant contains a few hundred individual gears in all, many in its accumulator. Basically, the accumulator dial has to rotate 36 degrees (1/10 of a turn) for a [1], and 324 degrees (9/10 of a turn) for a [9], not allowing for incoming carries. At some point in the gearing, one tooth needs to pass for a [1], and nine teeth for a [9]. There is no way to develop the needed movement from a driveshaft that rotates one revolution per cycle with few gears having practical (relatively small) numbers of teeth.

The Marchant, therefore, has three driveshafts to feed the little transmissions. For one cycle, they rotate 1/2, 1/4, and 1/12 of a revolution. . The 1/2-turn shaft carries (for each column) gears with 12, 14, 16, and 18 teeth, corresponding to digits 6, 7, 8, and 9. The 1/4-turn shaft carries (also, each column) gears with 12, 16, and 20 teeth, for 3, 4, and 5. Digits [1] and [2] are handled by 12 and 24-tooth gears on the 1/12-revolution shaft. Practical design places the 12th-rev. shaft more distant, so the 1/4-turn shaft carries freely-rotating 24 and 12-tooth idler gears. For subtraction, the driveshafts reversed direction.

In the early part of the cycle, one of five pendants moves off-center to engage the appropriate drive gear for the selected digit.

Some machines had as many as 20 columns in their full keyboards. The monster in this field was the &quot;Duodecillion&quot; made by Burroughs for exhibit purposes.

For sterling currency, £/s/d (and even farthings), there were variations of the basic mechanisms, in particular with different numbers of gear teeth and accumulator dial positions. To accommodate shillings and pence, extra columns were added for the tens digit[s], 10 and 20 for shillings, and 10 for pence. Of course, these functioned as radix-20 and radix-12 mechanisms.

A variant of the Marchant, called the Binary-Octal Marchant, was a radix-8 (octal) machine. It was sold to check very early vacuum-tube (valve) binary computers for accuracy. (Back then, the mechanical calculator was much more reliable than a tube/valve computer.)

As well, there was a twin Marchant, comprising two pinwheel Marchants with a common drive crank and reversing gearbox. Twin machines were relatively rare, and apparently were used for surveying calculations. At least one triple machine was made.

The Facit calculator, and one similar to it, are basically pinwheel machines, but the array of pinwheels moves sidewise, instead of the carriage. The pinwheels are biquinary; digits 1 through 4 cause the corresponding number of sliding pins to extend from the surface; digits 5 through 9 also extend a five-tooth sector as well as the same pins for 6 through 9.

The keys operate cams that operate a swinging lever to first unlock the pin-positioning cam that is part of the pinwheel mechanism; further movement of the lever (by an amount determined by the key&#x27;s cam) rotates the pin-positioning cam to extend the necessary number of pins.

Stylus-operated adders with circular slots for the stylus, and side-by -side wheels, as made by Sterling Plastics (USA), had an ingenious anti-overshoot mechanism to ensure accurate carries.
=== The end of an era ===
Mechanical calculators continued to be sold, though in rapidly decreasing numbers, into the early 1970s, with many of the manufacturers closing down or being taken over. Comptometer type calculators were often retained for much longer to be used for adding and listing duties, especially in accounting, since a trained and skilled operator could enter all the digits of a number in one movement of the hands on a comptometer quicker than was possible serially with a 10-key electronic calculator. In fact, it was quicker to enter larger digits in two strokes using only the lower-numbered keys; for instance, a 9 would be entered as 4 followed by 5. Some key-driven calculators had keys for every column, but only 1 through 5; they were correspondingly compact. The spread of the computer rather than the simple electronic calculator put an end to the comptometer. Also, by the end of the 1970s, the slide rule had become obsolete.

<doc id="432901" wikidata="Q2477573" url="?curid=432901" title="The Jean Genie">
<text>&quot;The Jean Genie&quot; is a song by the English singer-songwriter David Bowie, originally released in November 1972 as the lead single to his 1973 album &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;. Co-produced by Ken Scott, Bowie recorded it with his backing band the Spiders from Mars − comprising Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey. According to Bowie, it was &quot;a smorgasbord of imagined Americana&quot;, with a protagonist inspired by Iggy Pop, and the title being an allusion to author Jean Genet. One of Bowie&#x27;s most famous tracks, it was promoted with a film clip featuring Andy Warhol associate Cyrinda Foxe and peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Background and recording==
&quot;The Jean Genie&quot; originated on the Ziggy Stardust Tour as an impromptu jam, titled &quot;Bussin&#x27;&quot;, on the tour bus between the first two concerts in Cleveland and Memphis, when Mick Ronson began playing the Bo Diddley-inspired guitar riff on his new Les Paul. It subsequently became the first song Bowie composed for &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, in autumn 1972 during his 1972 US tour, completing the song in New York City, where he spent time with the Warhol set&#x27;s Cyrinda Foxe. Bowie later asserted, &quot;I wrote it for her amusement in her apartment. Sexy girl.&quot; Bowie later in the 1990s described the song as &quot;a smorgasbord of imagined America&quot; and &quot;my first New York song.&quot;

The recording took place at New York&#x27;s RCA Studios on 6 October 1972. &quot;I had a really great conversation with [bassist] Trevor Bolder,&quot; recalled Def Leppard&#x27;s Joe Elliott. &quot;I said, &#x27;You remember when you were doing The Jean Genie?&#x27; He said, &#x27;No. We did it in an hour and a half.&#x27;&quot; 

Mixing occurred the following week at RCA Studio B in Nashville, Tennessee; the original single mix is in narrow stereo, while the stereo soundscape is wider in the album mix.

==Music and lyrics==
The song&#x27;s chugging R&amp;B riff is often compared to the Yardbirds, especially their cover of Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot;, but was most probably inspired by French singer Jacques Dutronc&#x27;s &quot;La Fille du Père Noël&quot; (1966), while the lyrics have been likened to the &quot;stylised sleaze&quot; of the Velvet Underground. The subject matter was inspired in part by Bowie&#x27;s friend Iggy Pop or, in Bowie&#x27;s own words, &quot;an Iggy-type character... it wasn&#x27;t &quot;actually&quot; Iggy.&quot; The line &quot;He&#x27;s so simple minded, he can&#x27;t drive his module&quot; later gave the band Simple Minds their name.

The title has long been taken as an allusion to the author Jean Genet. Bowie was once quoted as saying that this was &quot;subconscious... but it&#x27;s probably there, yes&quot;. In his 2005 book &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;, he stated this less equivocally: &quot;Starting out as a lightweight riff thing I had written one evening in NY for Cyrinda&#x27;s enjoyment, I developed the lyric to the otherwise wordless pumper and it ultimately turned into a bit of a smorgasbord of imagined Americana ... based on an Iggy-type persona ... The title, of course, was a clumsy pun upon Jean Genet&quot;.

==Music video==

Mick Rock directed a film clip to promote the song, in October 1972 in San Francisco, mixing concert and studio footage of Bowie performing with the Spiders from Mars, along with location shots of the singer posing at the Mars Hotel with Cyrinda Foxe. Bowie wanted the video to depict &quot;Ziggy as a kind of Hollywood street-rat&quot; with a &quot;consort of the Marilyn brand&quot;. This led to Foxe&#x27;s casting, and she flew from New York to San Francisco especially for the shoot.

Bowie also recorded &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; for BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the performance being broadcast on 4 January 1973. Unusual for the era, the four-piece band performed live, and included an extended guitar solo by Ronson. Tapes of this edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; were subsequently wiped, but a copy was made by BBC cameraman John Henshall, who had utilised the then new fisheye lens camera techniques for the performance. Henshall was contacted to share his historic material, and was surprised to find he was the only one with a surviving copy. The film has since been preserved and was shown at the British Film Institute in December 2011. The BBC re-broadcast the clip in its &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot; Christmas Special on 21 December 2011, for the first time since the original broadcast in January 1973.

==Release and reception==
&quot;The Jean Genie&quot; was released on 24 November 1972 by RCA Records (as RCA 2302) as the lead single to Bowie&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, with the 1972 song &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; as the B-side. On the album, it appears as the ninth and penultimate track. It spent 13 weeks on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 2, making it Bowie&#x27;s biggest hit until that time; it was kept off the top spot by Little Jimmy Osmond&#x27;s &quot;Long Haired Lover from Liverpool&quot;. In the US, it reached No. 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. While biographer David Buckley has described it as &quot;derivative, plodding, if undeniably catchy&quot;, it remains one of Bowie&#x27;s signature tunes and was often played at his concerts.

Upon release of the single in the U.S., &quot;Record World&quot; found the song &quot;disappointing&quot;, saying that &quot;Bowie, usually a master of melody and dynamics, has used an ancient riff on this more rhythmic number.&quot;

Some controversy arose in the UK when fellow RCA act the Sweet issued the song &quot;Block Buster!&quot;, utilising a riff very similar to &quot;The Jean Genie&quot;. The Sweet&#x27;s single, written by Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, and recorded and released slightly later than Bowie&#x27;s song, made No. 1 in the UK charts and No. 73 on the US charts while &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; was still in the UK Top 10. All parties maintained that the similarity was, in Nicky Chinn&#x27;s words, &quot;absolute coincidence&quot;. Chinn described a meeting with Bowie at which the latter &quot;looked at me completely deadpan and said &#x27;Cunt!&#x27; And then he got up and gave me a hug and said, &#x27;Congratulations...&#x27;&quot;

&quot;The Jean Genie&quot; has appeared on lists ranking Bowie&#x27;s best songs by &quot;Uncut&quot; (11), &quot;The Guardian&quot; (19), &quot;NME&quot; (33), &quot;Mojo&quot; (64) and &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; (67).

==Live versions and subsequent releases==
With 1974&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; was one of Bowie&#x27;s most performed songs, featuring during all of his solo tours except for the 1999 Hours Tour and 2002 Heathen Tour. A live version recorded at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on 20 October 1972 appeared on the bootleg album &quot;Santa Monica &#x27;72&quot; (1994), which received an official release as &quot;Live Santa Monica &#x27;72&quot; in 2008. This live take was also included on the bonus disc of &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; in 2003. The song was often used for experimentation by the musicians, incorporating other rock songs into the guitar breaks. One such version, recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon, London, on 3 July 1973, featured Jeff Beck on guitar and incorporated &quot;Love Me Do&quot; by the Beatles and &quot;Over Under Sideways Down&quot; by the Yardbirds. During the Diamond Dogs Tour, &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; was rearranged as a slow cabaret number, sometimes incorporating &quot;Love Me Do&quot; during the later shows; performances from this tour have featured on &quot;David Live&quot; (1974), &quot;Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles &#x27;74)&quot; (2017) and &quot;I&#x27;m Only Dancing (The Soul Tour 74)&quot; (2020).

During the 1976 Isolar Tour, the song was used as the final encore, extending into lengthy guitar jams, false endings and ad-libbed vocals. A live take recorded on 23 March 1976 was included on &quot;Live Nassau Coliseum &#x27;76&quot;, released as part of the 2010 reissues of &quot;Station to Station&quot;, in the 2016 box set &quot;Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)&quot;, and as a stand–alone album in 2017. Further performances from the 1978 Isolar II tour were included on the 2017 edition of &quot;Stage&quot; (1978) and &quot;Welcome to the Blackout&quot; in 2018. The song again appeared during the 1983 Serious Moonlight Tour into the same cabaret style as the 1974 tour. For the 1987 Glass Spider Tour, guitarists Peter Frampton and Carlos Alomar used the song for duets, incorporating the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;; one performance appeared in the concert video &quot;Glass Spider&quot; (1988/2007). A variety of standards were incorporated into performances of &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; during the 1990 Sound+Vision Tour, most prominently Them&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot;. Bowie debuted a slower, acoustic version of the song at the October 1996 Bridge School benefit concert, while Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins joined him for a more conventional rendition during Bowie&#x27;s fiftieth birthday concert in 1997. A live version from the Earthling Tour the same year was released on &quot;Look at the Moon! (Live Phoenix Festival 97)&quot; in 2021.

&quot;The Jean Genie&quot; has appeared on the compilation albums &quot;Changesonebowie&quot; (1976), &quot;The Best of Bowie&quot; (1980), &quot;ChangesBowie&quot; (1990), &quot;The Singles Collection&quot; (1993), &quot;The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974&quot; (1997), &quot;Best of Bowie&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; (2006), The single mix has also appeared on &quot;Nothing Has Changed&quot; (2014) and &quot;Legacy (The Very Best of David Bowie)&quot; (2016). This mix was also released on the bonus disc of &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; in 2003, and on &quot;Re:Call 1&quot;, part of the &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot; boxed set, in 2015.

==Appearances in popular culture==
* The song is featured in the BBC television series &quot;Life on Mars&quot; (named after a David Bowie song) and is mentioned by DCI Gene &quot;the Gene Genie&quot; Hunt, who periodically refers to himself as &#x27;The Gene Genie&#x27;. In the episode &quot;A Conflict of Interests&quot; it is playing as they enter the club; in a later scene, while they escort Stephen Warren from his club, Sweet&#x27;s &quot;Block Buster!&quot;, with its comparable riff, is played. Hunt refers to himself as the Gene Genie more frequently in the sequel series, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; (also named for a Bowie song) and his individual theme music on the latter programme is an instrumental version of &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; (retitled &quot;Gene Genie&quot;), created by series composer Edmund Butt.
* The song appears in Anton Corbijn&#x27;s 2007 Ian Curtis biopic &quot;Control&quot;. In the film a young Curtis sings along to the song as it plays on a record player in his bedroom; the song continues to play as the scene changes to Curtis and Debbie going to a Bowie concert.

<text>Mascara (, ) is a cosmetic commonly used to enhance the upper and lower eyelashes. It is used to darken, thicken, lengthen, and/or define the eyelashes. Normally in one of three forms—liquid, powder, or cream—the modern mascara product has various formulas; however, most contain the same basic components of pigments, oils, waxes, and preservatives. The most common form of mascara is a liquid in a tube with an application brush.

== Definition ==

The &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;mascara&quot; as &quot;a cosmetic substance for darkening, lengthening, curling, coloring, and thickening the eyelashes, applied with a brush or rod.&quot; The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) adds that mascara is occasionally used on the eyebrows as well.

The &quot;OED&quot; also references &quot;mascaro&quot; from works published in the late 19th century. In 1886, the &quot;Peck &amp; Snyder Catalogue&quot; advertises, &quot;Mascaro or Water Cosmetique... For darkening the eyebrow and moustaches without greasing them and making them prominent.&quot; In 1890, the &quot;Century Dictionary&quot; defined mascara as &quot;a kind of paint used for the eyebrows and eyelashes by actors.&quot; And in 1894, N. Lynn advises in &quot;Lynn&#x27;s Practical Hints for Making-up&quot;, &quot;to darken eyelashes, paint with mascara, or black paint, with a small brush.&quot;

== Etymology ==

The source of the word &quot;mascara&quot; is unclear. It was possibly derived from the Spanish word meaning &#x27;mask&#x27; or &#x27;stain&#x27;, and the Italian word &#x27; meaning &#x27;mask&#x27; is a possible origin. A related Catalan word describes soot or a black smear, and the Portuguese word &#x27; means &#x27;mask&#x27; and &quot;&quot; means dark stain or smut. There is even strong support for a possible source from the Arabic word or &#x27;buffoon&#x27;. The Hebrew word משקרות (in the phrase mesaqqeroth `eynayim) relating to women&#x27;s eyes is found in Isaiah 3:16. It may mean flirting or ogling with the eyes, or painting them with red pigment.

Latin treatises sometimes used the word mascara when referring to witches.

== History ==

The name Mascara was likely given in reference to the city which bears the same name, since in the mid-19th century the French discovered antimony powder during their conquest in the old city of Mascara in Algeria. The nomadic tribes used it as a beauty product but also to protect themselves from various trachomas and eye diseases.

Aesthetic adornment is a cultural universal and mascara can be documented in ancient Egypt. Records from around 4000 BC refer to a substance called kohl that was used to darken eyelashes, eyelids, and eyebrows. Kohl was used to mask the eyes, believed to ward off evil spirits and protect the soul, by both men and women. Often composed of galena; malachite; and charcoal or soot, crocodile stool; honey; and water was added to keep the kohl from running. Through Egypt&#x27;s influence, kohl usage persisted in the subsequent Babylonian, Greek and Roman empires. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, kohl fell into disuse on the European continent, where it had been considered solely a cosmetic; conversely, it continued to be widely used in the Middle East for religious purposes.

During the Victorian era, social opinion shifted radically towards the promotion of cosmetics, and women were known to spend a majority of their day occupied with beauty regimens. Great efforts were made to create the illusion of long, dark eyelashes. Attempting this, Victorian women made a type of mascara in their own homes. They would heat a mixture of ash or lampblack and elderberry juice on a plate and apply the heated mixture to their eyelashes.

The product that people would recognize as mascara today did not develop until the 19th century. A chemist named Eugène Rimmel developed a cosmetic using the newly invented petroleum jelly. The name Rimmel became synonymous with the substance and still translates to &quot;mascara&quot; in the Portuguese, Spanish, Greek, Turkish, Romanian, and Persian languages today.

Across the Atlantic Ocean and at roughly the same time, in 1915, Thomas Lyle Williams created a remarkably similar substance for his sister Mabel. In 1917 he started a mail-order business from the product that grew to become the company Maybelline.
The mascara developed by these two men consisted of petroleum jelly and coal in a set ratio. It was undeniably messy, and a better alternative was soon developed. A dampened brush was rubbed against a cake containing soap and black dye in equal proportions and applied to the lashes. Still it was extremely messy. No significant improvement occurred until 1957 with an innovation by Helena Rubinstein.

The events leading to Rubinstein&#x27;s improvement began in Paris in the early 20th century. There, at the fashion capital of the world, mascara was quickly gaining popularity and common usage. Elizabeth Arden and Helena Rubinstein, two giants in the American beauty industry, watched and kept abreast of its development. After the First World War, American consumers became eager for new products. Sensing an opportunity, both Rubinstein and Arden launched their own brands of cosmetics that included mascara. Through the efforts of these two rivals and public temperament, mascara finally gained respectability and favor in American society.

The invention of the photograph and motion picture launched mascara&#x27;s popularity and usage further forward in America. Motion pictures especially advertised a new standard of beauty and sex appeal. Famous actresses of the classic cinema era, such as Theda Bara, Pola Negri, Clara Bow, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Bette Davis, and Jean Harlow, depended heavily upon mascara for their glamorized appearances, which the average woman sought to mimic.

In 1933, a woman known on court records as Mrs. Brown consented to have her eyelashes permanently dyed. Unfortunately, the product, Lash Lure, used &quot;para&quot;-phenylenediamine, a chemical extremely toxic to the body, as the dyeing agent. At the time, cosmetics were unregulated by the Federal Drug Administration, and the dangers of paraphenylenediamine were unknown. Within hours of the treatment, Mrs. Brown began experiencing severe symptoms of stinging and burning eyes. By the next morning, Mrs. Brown&#x27;s eyes had developed ulcers which oozed and had swollen shut. Use of Lash Lure resulted in blindness in Mrs. Brown and fifteen other women and also caused the death of another through a bacterial infection. It was only after the Lash Lure incident and several others like it, documented in Ruth deForest Lamb&#x27;s book entitled &quot;American Chamber of Horrors&quot;, that Congress granted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the right to regulate cosmetics in 1938.
Years later in 1957, Rubinstein created a formula that evolved mascara from a hard cake into a lotion-based cream. She packaged the new mascara in a tube to be sold with a brush. For use, the cream was squeezed onto the brush and applied to lashes. Although still messy, it was a step towards the modern mascara product.
Soon, a grooved rod was patented. This device picked up the same amount of mascara for each use. Then the grooved rod was altered to the brush similar to the ones used today. The change in applicator led mascara to be even easier to use, and its popularity increased.

Mascara is now trending towards multi-functional usage, with many mascaras including lash-boosting serums, botanicals, and pro-vitamin-enriched formulas. Korean technology is at the forefront of the development, and a number of brands use tubing formulas to coat the lash.

===Ingredients and manufacture===
All formulations contain pigments, oils, and waxes.

=== Cosmetic pigments ===
The pigmentation for black mascara is similar to that used by the Egyptians and Victorian women. Black and brown mascaras typically are colored by use of iron oxides. Some mascaras contain ultramarine blue.

Mascara is composed of a base mixture of pigments, waxes, and oils with varying supporting components. Mascara pigments most commonly include iron oxides and titanium dioxide which provide mascara with its desired color. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) accounts for over 65% of inorganic pigments sales volume. TiO2 gives the pigment a white color while different iron oxides provide a variety of colors such as red, yellow, brown, and black. The particle size of opaque pigments ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 μm.

===Oils, waxes, etc.===
Among the many oils used, linseed oil, castor oil, eucalyptus oil, lanolin, and oil of turpentine are found frequently. Sesame oil is also commonly used. Waxes usually found in mascara are paraffin wax, carnauba wax, and beeswax.

The desired effects of the mascara account for most variations of ingredients. Water-resistant mascaras require hydrophobic ingredients, like dodecane. Non water-resistant mascaras have base ingredients that are water-soluble. Mascaras designed to lengthen or curl the eyelashes often contain nylon or rayon microfibers. Additionally, ceresin, gum tragacanth, and methyl cellulose are regular ingredients and serve as stiffeners.

=== Manufacture===
Mascara is often used on a daily basis around the world. In 2016 alone, U.S. consumers spent US$335.6 million on the top 10 leading mascara brands.

In one method of production, referred to as anhydrous, all waxes, oils, and pigments are mixed, heated, and agitated simultaneously. The alternative method, termed emulsion, starts by combining water and thickeners. Separately, waxes and emulsifiers are combined. Pigment is then added individually to both mixtures. Finally all is combined in a homogenizer, which acts as a high-speed agitator in order to thoroughly mix the oils, water, waxes, and emulsifiers—ingredients that naturally repulse each other.

Mascara has a shelf life of two to four months.

== Artistic usage ==
Smudged mascara has also become a symbolic way to show depression in photographs, such as the or &quot;crying mascara&quot; trend on social media. These references can carry deep emotional resonance and significance.

== Safety ==
Eye cosmetics containing &quot;kohl&quot;, &quot;kajal&quot;, &quot;al-kahal&quot;, &quot;surma&quot;, &quot;tiro&quot;, &quot;tozali&quot;, or &quot;kwalli&quot; often pose a lead poisoning risk. Products containing &quot;kohl&quot;, &quot;kajal&quot;, &quot;surma&quot;, and similar materials are illegal color additives in the United States as defined by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, section 201(t).

Mercury, as thiomersal, is widely used in the manufacture of mascara. In 2008, Minnesota became the first state in the United States to ban intentionally added mercury in cosmetics, giving it a tougher standard than the federal government.

It is more common to develop a stye, or commoner still, swollen eyelids. Styes and swollen eyelids are better classified as allergic reactions. The allergic reactions can be stimulated by any of the components of mascara but is usually attributed to methylparaben, aluminum powder, ceteareth-20, butylparaben, or benzyl alcohol.

If not cleaned properly, mascara can deposit itself under the conjunctiva in form of black lumps. Eyelashes naturally have microbial organisms; applying mascara may expose microbes to incubate in the mascara.

=== Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) ===
A 2021 study tested 231 makeup and personal care products and found organic fluorine, an indicator of PFAS, in more than half of the samples. High levels of fluorine were most commonly identified in waterproof mascara (82% of brands tested), foundations (63%), and liquid lipstick (62%).&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1021/acs.estlett.1c002402&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 13 types of individual PFAS compounds were found in each product. Since PFAS compounds are highly mobile, they are readily absorbed through human skin and through tear ducts, and such products on lips are often unwittingly ingested. Manufacturers often fail to label their products as containing PFAS, which makes it difficult for cosmetics consumers to avoid products containing PFAS.

<doc id="432925" wikidata="Q548921" url="?curid=432925" title="Tommy Mottola">
<text>Thomas Daniel Mottola (born July 14, 1948) is an American businessman, record executive, television producer, theater producer, film producer, investor, and serial entrepreneur. Mottola is the chairman of Mottola Media Group, co-founder of Ntertain Studios, and founding partner of Range Media Partners. He served as chairman and CEO of Sony Music Entertainment, parent company of the Columbia label, for nearly 15 years. Since 2000, he has been married to Mexican actress and singer Thalía.

==Early life==
Mottola was born in the Bronx, New York City, to a middle-class Italian-American family. He graduated from Iona Grammar School in 1962 and Iona Prep in 1966. After a brief period in military school, he attended high school and later Hofstra University on Long Island. However, he dropped out of Hofstra to pursue a music career as a guitarist and singer with The Exotics, an R&amp;B cover band.

==Career beginnings==
Mottola entered the music industry in the mid-1960s as a recording artist for CBS Records, performing under the name &quot;T.D. Valentine.&quot; When his recording career did not achieve commercial success, he transitioned into music management. He began working for Chappell Publishing, where he connected with various artists, and later established his own management company, Champion Entertainment Organization.

One of Mottola’s early successes was managing Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates, helping them secure a record deal and several lucrative endorsements. His innovative promotional strategies, including the use of music videos and tours, contributed significantly to their rise in popularity.

==Management successes==
Mottola successfully managed the black rock group Xavion, leveraging new media formats such as music videos and promotional tours to boost their visibility.

==Sony/Columbia==
In 1988, Mottola was hired by Sony Music Entertainment (then known as CBS Records) by Walter Yetnikoff to run its U.S. operations. In 1990, he succeeded Yetnikoff as chairman and CEO of the newly renamed Sony Music. During his tenure, Sony Music expanded its operations to over 60 countries and became the first major music company to offer digital downloads commercially. By 2000, Sony Music&#x27;s annual revenue exceeded $6 billion.

Mottola is widely recognized for signing and promoting artists such as Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Destiny&#x27;s Child, Gloria Estefan, CoCo Lee, Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Simpson, Shakira, and the Dixie Chicks. He also oversaw the release of digitally remastered compact discs of classic recordings by artists including Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Andy Williams, and Pink Floyd.

Mottola also worked closely with Michael Jackson during the production and promotion of Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous&quot; album. However, their professional relationship deteriorated during the promotion of Jackson&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Invincible&quot;. Jackson publicly accused Mottola of exploitative practices and labeled him a &quot;racist who exploited black talent.&quot; Jackson further alleged that &quot;recording companies really, really do conspire against the artists.&quot;

==After Sony==
Mottola served as the head of Sony Music Entertainment until January 2003. Following his departure, he established a new entertainment company encompassing recorded music, television production, theater, fashion, and branding management. The company was involved in reviving and managing the careers of artists such as Marc Anthony and Lindsay Lohan. Later, Mottola expanded his roster to include artists such as Cassie Ventura and Mika.

In a joint venture with Universal Music Group, Mottola revived the iconic Casablanca Records. Under this venture, he signed artists including Lindsay Lohan and Mika.

In January 2013, Mottola published his memoir, &quot;Hitmaker: The Man and His Music&quot;, co-written with Cal Fussman. The book offers insights into his career, the music industry, and his relationships with artists.

=== Mottola Media Group ===
After leaving Sony in 2003, Mottola founded Mottola Media Group, which has produced various projects across theater, television, and music. Among its notable productions is the musical adaptation of Chazz Palminteri&#x27;s &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot;. Palminteri credited Mottola with realizing the project and bringing it to fruition, stating that Mottola &quot;put the musical on his back&quot; while partnering with Dodger Properties. The production premiered on Broadway in December 2016 and ran until August 5, 2018. A national tour commenced in October 2018 at the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles.

In collaboration with Dodger Properties, Mottola Media Group also produced several other musicals, including &quot;&quot; (2017), &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; (Off-Broadway, 2004), and &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; (2016).

In 2018, Mottola Media Group signed a multi-year first-look deal with eOne, now part of Lionsgate, to develop scripted and unscripted television projects.

Mottola also created and produced documentaries for HBO, including &quot;The Latin Explosion: A New America&quot; (2015) and &quot;15: A Quinceañera Story&quot; (2017), the latter of which earned a Directors Guild of America (DGA) nomination.

=== Ntertain Studios ===
In March 2021, Mottola co-founded Ntertain Studios with Neon16 CEO and co-founder Lex Borrero, alongside representation firm Range Media Partners. Ntertain is described as &quot;an entertainment and media company that creates, develops, and produces content across multiple mediums, highlighting Latino stories and representing Latino talent, brands, and culture.&quot;

Ntertain&#x27;s notable productions include:

&quot;Los Montaner&quot; for Disney+, which was renewed for a second season.
&quot;Thalía&#x27;s Mixtape: El Soundtrack de Mi Vida&quot; for Paramount+.
&quot;La Firma (The Signing)&quot; and &quot;Neon&quot; for Netflix.
In 2023, Ntertain partnered with Audio Up Media to launch original Latino podcast programming and other multimedia projects.

Based in Miami, Ntertain is led by Mottola and Borrero in collaboration with Peter Micelli, CEO of Range Media Partners.

== Personal life ==
Mottola began dating Mariah Carey while she was recording &quot;Mariah Carey&quot;, and they were married at the Episcopal Saint Thomas Church in New York City on June 5, 1993, in a half-million dollar ceremony. The newlyweds moved into a custom-built mansion, located on a estate in Bedford, New York, referred to by Carey as &quot;Sing Sing&quot; (alluding to her feeling imprisoned there). Their relationship began to deteriorate due to their growing creative differences in terms of her music. They separated in December 1996, and announced it publicly on May 30, 1997. The couple divorced on March 4, 1998. Shortly afterwards they sold their home to Nelson Peltz for $20.5 million; it burned down in 1999.
Mottola married Thalía on 2 December 2000. The couple have two children, a daughter born in October 2007, and a son born in June 2011.

*In JAY-Z&#x27;s song &quot;Success&quot; featuring Nas, track 12 from his studio album American Gangster, Nas mentions &quot;Mottola&quot; in the last line of his third verse. &quot;Up your catalog, dog, mine&#x27;s worth too much.
