<text>Earley ( ) is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Wokingham, Berkshire, England. Along with the neighbouring town of Woodley, the Office for National Statistics places Earley within the Reading/Wokingham Urban Area; for the purposes of local government it falls within the Borough of Wokingham, outside the area of Reading Borough Council. Its name is sometimes spelt Erleigh or Erlegh and consists of a number of smaller areas, including Maiden Erlegh and Lower Earley, and lies some south and east of the centre of Reading, and some northwest of Wokingham. It had a population of 32,036 at the 2011 Census.

The main campus of the University of Reading, Whiteknights Park, lies partly in Earley and partly in the borough of Reading.

==History==


Evidence of prehistoric man has been found in locations around Earley. For example, a hand axe was found in the railway cutting; flint implements in a garden in Elm Lane; and hand axes in the gardens in Fowler Close and Silverdale Road. Most of these finds are thought to date from the late Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. Traces of flimsy shelters from the Mesolithic were discovered at the site of the old power station at Thames Valley Park in north Earley. Tools from that time have also been found, including a flint blade found in a garden in Silverdale Road. Archaeological evidence for continued human presence during the Bronze Age and Iron Age was also discovered on the site of the Thames Valley Park, and Roman remains were found on a building site off Meadow Road.

Earley is mentioned in the Domesday Book as &quot;Herlei&quot;, with two main manors: Erleigh St Bartholomew, later known as Erleigh Court; and Erleigh St Nicolas, later Erleigh White Knights. In Domesday Herlei is said to be &quot;held by Osbern Giffard from the King, previously Dunn held it in alod of King Edward. [It was] then [assessed] at 5 hides; now at 2 hides. There is land for 7 ploughs. In demesne are 1 ½ ploughs; and 4 Villeins and 7 bordars with 2 ½ ploughs. There is 1 slave, and 2 fisheries rendering 68d, 20 acres of meadow [and] woodland for 30 pigs. The value was 100 shillings, later 60 shillings, now £4&quot; The Erleghs, a family of knightly rank who took their name from the manors, held the manors of St Bartholemew and St Nicolas in the latter part of the 12th century through the 13th century and part of the 14th century. John de Erlegh (or John of Earley) was known as the White Knight, hence the renaming of the manor of Erleigh St Nicolas to Whiteknights. The Whiteknights estate was later owned by the Englefields, from 1606 to 1798, and then by the Marquis of Blandford, later the 5th Duke of Marlborough.

The manor of Maiden Erleigh was formed out of the manor of Erlegh, as a gift of land by John de Erlegh to Robert de Erlegh in 1368. Later it was transferred to Charles Hide of Abingdon. In 1673 the estate was sold to Valentine Crome, and after many changes of ownership at the end of the 18th century, it belonged to William Matthew Birt, who was Governor General of the Leeward Islands. In 1818 the property passed to the Rt Hon Edward Golding, MP for Downton in Wiltshire. In 1878 it was purchased by John Hargreaves, Master of the South Berks Hunt, who created a course where hunt and yeomanry races, similar to modern hunter chases, were run.

The course extended over an area now covered by Sutcliffe Avenue, Hillside Road and Mill Lane. The grandstand stood on an area opposite Loddon Infant School. The estate was purchased in 1903 by the millionaire Solly Joel who had a racecourse on the estate. The racecourse was demolished during the First World War and the grandstand was re-erected at Newbury Racecourse. Joel donated a piece of his land to the village to be used for sporting purposes: the park and pavilion were opened by the Duke of York, later George VI, as Sol Joel Park in 1927.

Earley&#x27;s boundaries historically extended further north-west towards Reading along the Wokingham Road as far as Cemetery Junction, and included the Newtown area between London Road and the River Kennet. In September 1887 the part of Earley north-west of a new boundary drawn along Whiteknights Road, Wilderness Road, Church Road and the South Eastern Railway was incorporated into the borough of Reading. This area included much of the then main village of Earley around the Three Tuns crossroads, but excluded the village school and the parish church of St Peter on the opposite side of Church Road. The civil parish boundary was adjusted to match the new borough boundary eighteen months later in March 1889, with the part of Earley in the borough of Reading being transferred to the civil parish of Reading St Giles. Ecclesiastical parish boundaries were unaffected by the civil parish and borough boundary changes, and much of the area transferred to the borough of Reading in 1887 still forms part of the ecclesiastical parish of Earley St Peter, which today extends as far as, but does not include, Palmer Park.

The University of Reading began as the University College, Reading, an extension of Oxford University in 1892; it became a university in its own right in 1926 and acquired its new site, which straddles the boundary between Earley and Reading, in 1947. Of the six large villas on the estate four were designed by Alfred Waterhouse (Erleigh Park 1859, Whiteknights 1868 (now called Old Whiteknights House), Foxhill 1868 and the Wilderness 1873). Waterhouse also designed Reading School (1865–71) in Erleigh Road, in the borough of Reading, extended Pepper Manor, now &#x27;Old School&#x27; in Leighton Park School, on Shinfield Road, in 1890, and built Grove House on the north of the school site (1892–94).

Earley established its own branch of the Women&#x27;s Institute, Earley WI, in 1938 to enable women in the local area to come together and develop skills, further their education, and improve the local community. Earley grew rapidly both before and after World War II, and was designated a town in 1974. From 1977, the Lower Earley housing estate was constructed by private companies, almost doubling Earley&#x27;s population to the current level. Two new primary schools were built, together with a large supermarket complex, which opened in 1979, and a sports centre. In 1988 a second shopping area, Maiden Place, opened. An additional secondary school was planned roughly opposite the sports centre next to Rushey Way, possibly on the site next to the police station. However, the school never materialised, and the land was built on.

===Listed buildings===

Despite its generally 19th- and 20th-century appearance, Earley has some remnants of its older past hidden in amongst the newer development.

==Geography==
Earley is bordered by the B3270, Lower Earley] Way, to the south and south-east; the boundary then follows the - railway line until it turns north to run to the east of the B3350 (Church Road and Pitts Lane) as far as the gyratory system where the B3350 joins the A4; the boundary then runs north to the River Thames. The boundary then runs upstream along the Thames as far as the River Kennet, then follows the Reading-Waterloo railway line again, until it meets the B3350; it then runs north-west along Whiteknights Road, cuts irregularly across the University of Reading Whiteknights Campus, and then runs to the east of the A327 (Shinfield Road) until it meets up again with the B3270. The extension of the Reading borough boundaries in 1888 had the result that the section of Earley lying to the north of the railway line (sometimes referred to as Old Earley or North Earley) is connected to the larger part to the south by only a narrow corridor of land. The Borough of Reading lies to the west, the River Thames to the north-west, Woodley to the north-east, Winnersh to the east, and Arborfield and Shinfield to the south.

Lower Earley is often spoken of as a town in its own right, but it is just a development at the southern end of the town. The name Lower Earley is however very old, having originally been applied to the low-lying land between the old Maiden Erlegh Estate and the River Loddon which runs along the eastern edge of the borough.

==Governance==
As of 2024, Earley is in the new parliamentary constituency of Earley and Woodley. It was previously part of the Wokingham constituency, except for the Whitegates Town Ward, comprising the part of Earley lying north of the - railway line, which was in Reading East.

Earley was originally a liberty in the parish of Sonning. It became an independent ecclesiastical parish in 1854 and later a civil parish. Earley has two levels of local government: Earley Town Council, created from the former Parish Council in 1974, based at Radstock House in Radstock Lane, and Wokingham Borough Council based at Shute End in Wokingham. There are 25 councillors representing eight wards on the Town Council and 12 Borough Councillors (out of 54 on the Borough Council) representing four Earley wards (Hillside; Hawkedon; Maiden Erlegh; and Bulmershe and Whitegates). The Bulmershe and Whitegates ward also includes the Bulmershe ward of Woodley Town Council. The Town Wards do not coincide with the Borough Wards: Cutbush and Hawkedon Town Wards make up the Hawkedon Borough Ward; Hillside and Radstock the Hillside Borough Ward; Redhatch, St Nicolas and Maiden Erlegh the Maiden Erlegh Borough ward; and Whitegates together with the Woodley Town Ward of Bulmershe make up the Bulmershe and Whitegates Borough Ward. Town Council elections are held every four years; the last one was in 2023. Borough Elections are held by thirds with one in 3 years out of every 4 for the three member wards and one year with no election.

==Amenities==
Earley town council runs Sol Joel Park, leased from Reading Borough Council for 50 years, Meadow Park off Meadow Road, Bulmershe Park (jointly with Woodley), the BMX track near Paddick Drive which was opened in 2011, two community centres and Maiden Erlegh Lakes, which was declared a local nature reserve in 1997. The council has a large allotment at Culver Lane and a lawn cemetery at Mays Lane. The council also provides the bus shelters at the main Reading bound stops. Within Earley, the council operates the Waterside Centre, a canoe centre in Thames Valley Park, and the Loddon Valley Leisure Centre. They also own Chalfont Park and Laurel Park in Earley, both of which include football pitches.

Even after its recent development, Earley has some remnants of ancient woodland within its boundaries, including Pearman&#x27;s Copse and Redhatch Copse.

==Transport==

Earley railway station is on the line from to . Winnersh Triangle railway station, which opened in 1986, is also near Earley. Earley is served by Reading Buses who provide a number of bus services to and from the centre of Reading, namely the 4, X4, 19a, 19b, 19c; and the 21, a 24-hour service. The 17 bus runs 24 hours a day from the junction at the Three Tuns, through Reading town centre, towards Tilehurst. can be reached by bus on the Wokingham Road or by train from Earley or Winnersh Triangle stations. Earley is to the north of the M4 motorway which connects London with Bristol.

==Economy==

Earley is home to the Thames Valley Park which is alongside the Thames to the east of the A329(M) motorway. The park houses offices of many major companies including the UK headquarters of BG Group, Microsoft, ING Direct and SGI together with offices of Oracle Corporation, Computacenter, David Lloyd Leisure, Cybersource, JP Executive Recruitment, Open Text, Regus, Websense and Worktube CV. The neighbouring Suttons Business Park houses more service and high tech companies such as Rentokil Initial, Service Point, HP Invent, MOOG, FPS and Royal Mail. One of the main industries located in Earley was Sutton Seeds, whose headquarters were in London Road, at the northern end of what was once the A329(M) motorway spur (now the A3290). The building was partly taken over by the civil engineering consultancy Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners in June 1974, when it relocated from London. Sutton Seeds finally departed in 1975 to its new base in Torquay.

Earley was selected by the Central Electricity Board as the site of an innovative power station to provide electricity in support of the war effort which was commissioned in 1942. It was also the site of a pioneering main-service gas turbine electricity generator, this was a 56 MW machine driven by four Rolls-Royce Avon jet engines and was commissioned in 1965. See Central Electricity Board.

==Education==
Earley has 6 primary schools, Aldryngton, Earley St Peters, Hillside, Radstock, Whiteknights and Hawkedon, and Maiden Erlegh School, a coeducational secondary school. In addition, the following schools all have children from Earley and Lower Earley within their designated catchment areas, as defined by Wokingham Borough Council: The Emmbrook School, Forest School, The Holt School and The Piggott School.

<text>The National Alliance of Basketball Leagues (NABL) (founded 1961) is the descendant of the industrial-based basketball clubs that formed into the National Basketball League (NBL) in the early 1930s.

==History==

===Origins in the 1930s===

The league was the brainchild of Indianapolis grocer Irv Kautsky, who sponsored the Indianapolis Kautskys club team, and Goodyear Tire Company, who originally sponsored the Akron Wingfoots. After a false start in the early 1930s, the league was restarted in 1938, with the Wingfoots winning the initial NBL title. By World War II, both the Wingfoots and the Firestone Tire Company&#x27;s Non-Skids had suspended play, but other seminal pro teams such as the Ft. Wayne Zollner Pistons (now the Detroit Pistons), Syracuse Nationals (now the Philadelphia 76ers), Rochester Royals (now the Sacramento Kings), Minneapolis Lakers (now the Los Angeles Lakers), and Tri-Cities BlackHawks (now the Atlanta Hawks), all of whom are currently playing in the NBA, had joined.&lt;br&gt;
After World War II, the fledgling Basketball Association of America was established by arena owners in large cities to try to capture the popularity of the NBL teams from the smaller communities. This attempt failed miserably as 13 of the 16 BAA teams folded. Undaunted, the remaining BAA teams, the Philadelphia Warriors, Boston Celtics, and New York Knicks convinced the top NBL teams to join with them and they formed the NBA. Thus, the early NBA was composed mostly of teams brought over from the NBL and three BAA teams.

===1947–1961: Creation of the NIBL===
The remaining NBL teams reformed and changed the name to the National Industrial Basketball League (NIBL) where teams such as the Denver Truckers, Chicago Jamaco Saints, Akron Wingfoots, Phillips 66ers, Peoria Cats, Philadelphia Tapers, Lexington Marathon Oilers and Cleveland Pipers thrived as club teams. In the 1960s the league recognized the changing sponsorship of the teams away from the large industrial companies and renamed it the National AAU Basketball League (NABL).

===List of champions===

1948: Milwaukee Harnischfegers&lt;br&gt;
1949: Phillips 66ers&lt;br&gt;
1950: Phillips 66ers&lt;br&gt;

1952: Phillips 66ers&lt;br&gt;
1953: Phillips 66ers&lt;br&gt;

1955: Phillips 66ers&lt;br&gt;
1956: Phillips 66ers&lt;br&gt;
1957: Phillips 66ers&lt;br&gt;

1959: Denver-Chicago Truckers
&lt;br&gt;
1960: Phillips 66ers&lt;br&gt;
1961: Cleveland Pipers

===1961–1963: Decline===
During the early 1960s, the Pipers and the Tapers left to join the Hawaii Chiefs, Kansas City Steers, Los Angeles Jets and other teams to form the American Basketball League; when this venture folded, some of these teams returned to the NABL.

By the end of the 1970s, the NABL teams elected to adapt touring schedules rather than league schedules and the NABL format was mothballed until it was brought back in the 1990s when many of the legendary teams had been restarted under a new wave of sponsors. Today, the NABL teams are focused on preparing post-college players for the opportunity to play pro basketball overseas.

==National Amateur Athletic Union Basketball League (1966–1973)==
In 1966, the NABL organized the National Amateur Athletic Union Basketball League, with the league&#x27;s champions playing at FIBA&#x27;s Intercontinental Cup, as the North American Champions. The Akron Wingfoots won the title on the three occasions that they represented the country at the FIBA Intercontinental Cup.

===List of Champions===
1967: Akron Wingfoots
1968: Akron Wingfoots
1969: Akron Wingfoots
1970: 
1971: Lexington Marathon Oil
1972: Dayton Sanders Stone

<text>George Robert Stephanopoulos (born February 10, 1961) is an American television host, political commentator, and former Democratic advisor. Stephanopoulos currently is a coanchor with Robin Roberts and Michael Strahan on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and host of &quot;This Week,&quot; ABC&#x27;s Sunday morning current events news program.
Before his career as a journalist, Stephanopoulos was an advisor to the Democratic Party. He rose to early prominence as a communications director for the 1992 presidential campaign of Bill Clinton and subsequently became White House communications director. He was later senior advisor for policy and strategy, before departing in December 1996.

==Early life and education==
George Stephanopoulos was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, the son of Robert George Stephanopoulos and Nickolitsa &quot;Nikki&quot; Gloria (née Chafos). His parents were of Greek descent. His father was a Greek Orthodox priest and dean emeritus of the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in New York City. His mother was the director of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America National News Service for many years.

Following some time in Purchase, New York, Stephanopoulos moved to the eastern suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio, where he graduated in 1978 from Orange High School in Pepper Pike.

In 1982, Stephanopoulos received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Columbia University in New York and was the salutatorian of his class. While at Columbia, he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa his junior year and was awarded a Harry S. Truman Scholarship. He was also a sports broadcaster for 89.9 WKCR-FM, the university&#x27;s radio station. As a student, he lived in Carman Hall and East Campus.

Stephanopoulos attended Balliol College at the University of Oxford in England, as a Rhodes Scholar, earning a Master of Arts in Theology in 1984.

Stephanopoulos worked in Washington, D.C., as an aide to Democratic congressman Ed Feighan of Ohio. His job included drafting letters, memos, and speeches. His salary was reportedly $14,500 a year. He later became Feighan&#x27;s chief of staff.

In 1988, Stephanopoulos worked on the Michael Dukakis U.S. presidential campaign. He noted that one of his attractions to the campaign was that Dukakis was a Greek-American liberal from Massachusetts. After the campaign, Stephanopoulos became an executive floor assistant to Dick Gephardt, U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader; he held this position until he joined the Clinton campaign.

=== Clinton administration ===

Stephanopoulos was, with David Wilhelm and James Carville, a leading member of Clinton&#x27;s 1992 U.S. presidential campaign. His role on the campaign is portrayed in the documentary film &quot;The War Room&quot; (1993). It was eventually nominated for the Best Documentary Feature Academy Award.

In the Clinton administration, Stephanopoulos served as a senior advisor for policy and strategy. His initiatives focused on crime legislation, affirmative action, and health care. His salary was reportedly $125,000 per year. At the outset of Clinton&#x27;s presidency, Stephanopoulos also served as the &quot;de facto&quot; press secretary, briefing the press even though Dee Dee Myers was officially the White House Press Secretary. Stephanopoulos was regarded as a member of Bill Clinton&#x27;s inner circle.

In 1994, after Paula Jones accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment, Stephanopoulos and James Carville sought to discredit her allegations against Clinton. Both men suggested that Jones was just seeking cash for her story. Stephanopoulos also successfully sought to keep Jones&#x27; news conference off television. Stephanopoulos called NBC journalist Tim Russert, CNN chairman Tom Johnson, as well as several others, whom he convinced to keep her conference off television.

On February 25, 1994, Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes had a conference call with Roger Altman to discuss the Resolution Trust Corporation&#x27;s choice of Republican lawyer Jay Stephens to head the Madison Guaranty investigation as well as discussing if Stephens could be removed. The Madison Guaranty investigation would later turn into the Whitewater controversy.

In 1995, as he was pulling out of a parking space in front of a restaurant in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., he had a collision with a parked vehicle. Stephanopoulos was arrested and charged with leaving the scene of an accident and driving with an expired license and license plates. White House press secretary, Mike McCurry, said that President Clinton told Stephanopoulos &quot;not to worry about&quot; the accident but to get his license renewed. The charge of leaving the scene of an accident was subsequently dropped.

In 1999 Stephanopoulos and James Carville were sued for defamation by Gennifer Flowers. Stephanopoulos had made comments about her allegations that she had an affair with Bill Clinton. He accused Flowers of doctoring her taped conversation with Clinton to make her story look creditable. Stephanopoulos also called her story &quot;tabloid trash&quot;, &quot;garbage&quot;, and &quot;crap&quot;. The suit was dismissed since his comments were not the basis for defamation.

Stephanopoulos resigned from the Clinton administration shortly after Clinton was re-elected in 1996. Stephanopoulos is credited as among the first inside the White House to recognize the damage the Lewinsky affair could cause to the Clinton presidency.

His memoir, &quot;All Too Human: A Political Education&quot; (1999), was published after he left the White House during Clinton&#x27;s second term. It quickly became a number-one bestseller on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for five weeks. In the book, Stephanopoulos spoke of his depression and how his face broke out into hives due to the pressures of conveying the Clinton White House message. Clinton referred to the book in his autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot;, expressed regret for the excessive pressure he placed on the young staffer.

Stephanopoulos&#x27;s book covers his time with Clinton from the day he met him in September 1991, to the day Stephanopoulos left the White House in December 1996, through two presidential campaigns and four years in the White House. Stephanopoulos describes Clinton in the book as a &quot;complicated man responding to the pressures and pleasures of public life in ways I found both awesome and appalling&quot;.

== Journalism ==
After leaving the White House at the end of Clinton&#x27;s first term, Stephanopoulos became a political analyst for ABC News, and served as a correspondent on &quot;This Week&quot;, ABC&#x27;s Sunday morning public affairs program; &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, the evening news broadcast; &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, the morning news program; along with other various special broadcasts.
In September 2002, Stephanopoulos became host of &quot;This Week&quot;, and ABC News officially named him &quot;Chief Washington Correspondent&quot; in December 2005. The program&#x27;s title added the new host&#x27;s name.

When named to the position, Stephanopoulos was a relative newcomer to the show, usurping longtime panelists and short-term co-hosts Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts who, for a few years, briefly replaced the longtime original host, David Brinkley.

ABC News executives reportedly offered Ted Koppel, former &quot;Nightline&quot; anchor, the &quot;This Week&quot; host job in 2005 after the program&#x27;s ratings had become a regular third-, fourth-, and sometimes fifth-place finish after competitors NBC, CBS, Fox, and syndicated programs. However, &quot;This Week&quot; beat &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on January 11, 2009, when Stephanopoulos interviewed president-elect Barack Obama.

On April 16, 2008, Stephanopoulos co-moderated, with Charles Gibson, the twenty-first, and ultimately final, Democratic Party presidential debate between Illinois Senator Barack Obama and New York Senator Hillary Clinton for the 2008 election cycle. While the debate received record ratings, the co-moderators were heavily criticized for focusing most of the first hour of the debate on controversies that occurred during the campaign rather than issues such as the economy and the Iraq War. Stephanopoulos acknowledged the legitimacy of the concerns over the order of the questions, but said they were issues in the campaign that had not been covered in previous debates.

During the 2008 presidential election campaign, Stephanopoulos launched a blog &quot;George&#x27;s Bottom Line&quot; on the ABC News website. Stephanopoulos blogged about political news and analysis from Washington.


In December 2009, ABC News president David Westin offered Stephanopoulos Diane Sawyer&#x27;s job on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; after Sawyer was named anchor of &quot;World News&quot;. Stephanopoulos accepted the new position and began co-anchoring &quot;GMA&quot; on December 14, 2009. Stephanopoulos announced on January 10, 2010, that that would be his last broadcast as the permanent host of &quot;This Week&quot;. However, after his successor, Christiane Amanpour, left the show amid sagging ratings, it was announced that Stephanopoulos would return as host of &quot;This Week&quot; in December 2011. He signed a deal to stay with ABC until 2021 worth $105 million.

On January 7, 2012, Stephanopoulos was the co-moderator of a debate among Mitt Romney, Ron Paul and Rick Santorum. During the debate, Stephanopoulos repeatedly asked Romney whether the former Massachusetts governor believes the U.S. Supreme Court should overturn a 1965 ruling that a constitutional right to privacy bars states from banning contraception. During the debate, Romney said it was a preposterous question.

Following Diane Sawyer&#x27;s departure from World News at the end of August 2014, Stephanopoulos was the Chief Anchor at ABC News from 2014 to 2020 while retaining his roles on &quot;GMA&quot; and &quot;This Week&quot;. Stephanopoulos leads a new documentary unit for Disney&#x27;s digital platforms and hosts four primetime hour-long specials on the ABC network annually.

===Speaking engagements===
In 2009, Stephanopoulos spoke at the annual Tri-C Presidential Scholarship Luncheon held at the Renaissance Cleveland Hotel and praised Cuyahoga Community College.

===Other ventures===

George Stephanopoulos is the co-founder of production companies BedBy8 and George Stephanopoulos Productions. These companies produced &quot;Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields&quot;, &quot;Grand Knighthawk: Infiltrating the KKK&quot;, &quot;Power Trip: Those Who Seek Power and Those Who Chase Them&quot;, and &quot;Out of the Shadows: The Man Behind the Steele Dossier&quot;.

==Controversies==
===Real estate loan controversy===
In 1994, columnist Jack Anderson reported that Stephanopoulos signed an $835,000 commercial real estate deal consisting of a two-story apartment, including an eyewear retailer, with a below-market loan rate from a bank owned by Hugh McColl, who had been called by President Clinton &quot;the most enlightened banker in America&quot;. A NationsBank commercial loan officer said that this loan did &quot;not fit our product matrix&quot; as banks typically offer such loans for only those customers who have deep pockets and on a short-term adjustable rate basis. Stephanopoulos&#x27;s real estate agent explained that &quot;nobody making $125,000 could qualify for the property without the commercial property (lease).&quot; One former senior bank regulator told Anderson, &quot;If his name were George Smith, and he didn&#x27;t work in the White House, this loan wouldn&#x27;t have gotten made.&quot;

Regarding the controversy, NationsBank stated, &quot;The loan described by Jack Anderson as a commercial loan to George Stephanopoulos was, in fact, a residential mortgage loan. At the time the loan commitment was made, Mr. Anderson (or his imaginary &#x27;George Smith&#x27; who &#x27;doesn&#x27;t work in the White House&#x27;) could have walked into any NationsBank Mortgage Company office in the D.C. area and received the same excellent rate and term for the same deal.&quot;

However, Stephanopoulos&#x27;s realtor states that he would not have qualified for the loan without the commercial property rent. One NationsBank source states that the issuance of a residential loan on mixed-use properties is such a rarity that it was not even addressed in the &quot;NationsBank Mortgage Corporation&#x27;s Program Summary&quot; or its &quot;Credit Policy Manual&quot;. A NationsBank underwriting memo revealed that one of the three restrictions for mixed-use properties is that &quot;the borrower must be the owner of the business entity&quot;. The source claims that NationsBank told the listing agent that, &quot;We&#x27;re not (interested in mixed-use properties), but we do have an appetite for this particular loan.&quot; NationsBank&#x27;s primary regulator at the time was Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, a Rhodes scholar who attended Yale Law School with President Clinton, and who had been asked to investigate NationsBank by Democratic congressmen Henry B. Gonzalez and John Dingell.

===Clinton Foundation charity donations ===
Stephanopoulos donated $25,000 in 2012, 2013, and 2014, a total of $75,000, to the Clinton Foundation, but did not disclose the donations to ABC News, his employer, or to his viewers. Stephanopoulos failed to reveal the donations even on April 26, 2015, while interviewing Peter Schweizer, the author of &quot;Clinton Cash&quot;, a book which alleges that donations to the Foundation influenced some of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s actions as Secretary of State. After exposure of the donations by &quot;Politico&quot; on May 14, 2015, Stephanopoulos apologized and admitted he should have disclosed the donations to ABC News and its viewers. The story was broken by &quot;The Washington Free Beacon&quot;, which had questioned ABC News regarding the matter. The donations had been reported by the Clinton Foundation, which Stephanopoulos had considered sufficient, a reliance ABC News characterized as &quot;an honest mistake&quot;.

Based on Stephanopoulos&#x27;s donations to The Clinton Foundation charity and his behavior during prior interviews and presidential debates, Republican party leaders and candidates expressed their distrust, and called for him to be banned from moderating 2016 Presidential debates, due to bias and conflict of interest. He agreed to drop out as a moderator of the scheduled February 2016 Republican presidential primary debate.

In the month prior to the revelation of his donations, Stephanopoulos told Jon Stewart on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; that when money is given to the Clinton Foundation, &quot;everybody&quot; knows there&#x27;s &quot;a hope that that&#x27;s going to lead to something, and that&#x27;s what you have to be careful of.&quot;

===Jeffrey Epstein association===
In 2010, Stephanopoulos attended a dinner party at the home of convicted sex offender socialite Jeffrey Epstein alongside Chelsea Handler, Woody Allen, Katie Couric, Prince Andrew, Charlie Rose and Eva Andersson-Dubin. Following Epstein&#x27;s arrest in July 2019, the guest list of the party was reported online, with those attending receiving backlash, Stephanopoulos denied being friends with Epstein, with the party being the only encounter.

Stephanopoulos told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;That dinner was the first and last time I&#x27;ve seen him, I should have done more due diligence. It was a mistake to go.&quot;

===Donald Trump lawsuit===
On March 19, 2024, Donald Trump filed a defamation lawsuit in Florida against ABC News and Stephanopoulos for an undisclosed sum over a March 10 airing of &quot;This Week&quot;, arguing that Stephanopoulos harmed Trump&#x27;s reputation by claiming he was found liable for raping the writer E. Jean Carroll. The judge presiding over the case stated that the jury did find that Trump raped Carroll. In July 2024, Judge Cecilia Altonaga, presiding over the suit brought by Trump, denied a motion to dismiss by Stephanopoulos, finding that the technical definition used by the judge in the New York case did not examine the findings made by the jury, which was &quot;sexual abuse&quot;, not &quot;rape&quot;. On December 14, 2024 George Stephanopoulos and ABC News settled the lawsuit, paying $15 million to Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential library as a charitable contribution, $1 million for Trump&#x27;s legal fees, and issuing a public apology to Trump for Stephanopoulos&#x27; repeatedly made false statements about Trump during the interview on March 10.

==In popular culture==
In the fourth episode of the first season of the NBC television series &quot;Friends&quot;, entitled &quot;The One with George Stephanopoulos&quot; and originally aired 13 October 1994, the girls spy on Stephanopoulos across the street, after they were delivered his pizza by accident.

Stephanopoulos was the inspiration for the character of Henry Burton in Joe Klein&#x27;s novel &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1996). Burton was subsequently portrayed by Adrian Lester in the 1998 film adaptation. Michael J. Fox&#x27;s character, Lewis Rothschild, in the film &quot;The American President&quot; (1995), written by Aaron Sorkin was modeled after Stephanopoulos. He was also used by Sorkin as the model for Rob Lowe&#x27;s character, Sam Seaborn, on the television drama series &quot;The West Wing&quot;. According to Stephanopoulos, his role in the Clinton administration was more like Bradley Whitford&#x27;s character Josh Lyman than Seaborn or Rothschild.

In 2000, he rivaled John F. Kennedy Jr. as the nineties&#x27; most eligible non-Hollywood bachelor, appearing (along with George Clooney) in a &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Most Wanted&quot; list.

Stephanopoulos appeared in the &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; episode &quot;Buy the Book&quot;, where he bought a first edition of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; for $675.

Stephanopoulos returned to his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Columbia University, in 2003, serving as the keynote speaker at Columbia College&#x27;s Class Day. In 2013, Stephanopoulos played himself in &quot;House of Cards&quot; and in 2014 he played himself &quot;Shadows&quot;, an episode of &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; In September 2016, Stephanopoulos was featured on a €1 (1 euro) Greek postage stamp, along with other notable Greek-Americans.

In 2021, Stephanopoulos was portrayed by George H. Xanthis in two episodes of &quot;&quot;; the third season of the FX true-crime anthology television series &quot;American Crime Story&quot;.

In July 2022, &quot;Loot&quot;&#x27;s episode 4 of season 1 was released, in which main character Molly Novak said, &quot;sometimes I turn on the news and pretend George Stephanopoulos is my husband.&quot;

He is mentioned in the lyrics of the song &quot;The Most Unwanted Song&quot;.

==Personal life==
Stephanopoulos is a Greek Orthodox Christian and has earned a master&#x27;s degree in theology.

Stephanopoulos married Ali Wentworth, an actress, comedian, and writer, in 2001 at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity on New York&#x27;s Upper East Side. They have two daughters, one born in 2002 and one born in 2005. Stephanopoulos was introduced to transcendental meditation by Jerry Seinfeld. Conducting an interview on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, he said, &quot;We&#x27;re all here because we all have something in common—we all practice Transcendental Meditation. … I think that people don&#x27;t really understand exactly what it is and what a difference it has made in people&#x27;s lives.&quot;

==Honors==
In May 2007, Stephanopoulos received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from St. John&#x27;s University in New York City.

He has won two, and been nominated for 17, News and Documentary Emmy Awards.

<doc id="429667" wikidata="Q1650800" url="?curid=429667" title="R. A. F. Penrose Jr.">
<text>Richard Alexander Fullerton Penrose Jr. (December 17, 1863 – July 31, 1931), better known throughout his career as R. A. F. Penrose Jr., was an American mining geologist and entrepreneur.

He was from a prominent Philadelphia family of British descent. His brothers were U.S. senator Boies Penrose, mining engineer Spencer Penrose, and gynecologist Charles Bingham Penrose, and his grandfather was U.S. politician Charles B. Penrose.

Penrose graduated in 1885 with a Ph.D. from Harvard for work on phosphates. Later, he performed geological surveys in Texas and Arkansas until 1892, and then traveled the country as a mining surveyor. Most notable was his survey of Cripple Creek, Colorado, for the U.S. Geological Survey. Penrose refrained from purchasing or investing in mines in the Cripple Creek area because of what he saw as his ethical responsibility as a USGS employee, but did purchase and invest in mines elsewhere, including silver and copper mines in Arizona.

In 1903 his brothers and father were investors who formed the Utah Copper Company.

After his father died in 1908, Penrose made a complete career change, using his knowledge as a mining geologist to succeed as a mining investor and as an entrepreneur in other areas as well. Having amassed considerable wealth in these efforts, Penrose established the Penrose Medal of the Geological Society of America (GSA) in 1927. 

Penrose was very active in GSA: he was elected as a Member of GSA in 1889, served on GSA Council from 1914 to 1916, was GSA vice president in 1919, a member of the Finance Committee from 1924 to 1929, and GSA president in 1930. Upon his death in 1931, he left a generous bequest to GSA, with the remainder of his estate after more minor bequests divided equally between the Geological Society of America and the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia: nearly $4 million went to each society (approximately equivalent to $ million in ). The Penrose bequest serves to support the research grants program of the Geological Society of America. 

Penrose was also a founding member and president of the Society of Economic Geologists (SEG), created in 1920 by GSA members who were especially interested in economic geology. Penrose established the Penrose Gold Medal of the SEG in 1923.

In 1905, Penrose was elected to the American Philosophical Society. Penrose was President of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 1922-1926.

Penrose was inducted into the US National Mining Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Career==
===Business===

Gruener has been working for more than two decades in the fields of software development, systems engineering, and corporate development. In 1982, he founded &quot;Virtual Microsystems&quot;, a communications software company that was later merged with a larger corporation. Garrett specializes in information technology and is on the board of directors of nCircle Network Security, Xelerated, and Nanomix. In 1992, he became a Partner at Burr, Egan, Deleage &amp; Co. In 1996, along with Jean Deleage, Guy Nohra and Marino Polestral, he co-founded Alta Partners, a venture capital firm in life sciences. As of 2018, he is still serving as the company&#x27;s Managing Director. He is also on the Board of Directors of Goldman School of Public Policy, part of the University of California, Berkeley.

====Ask.com====
In 1995, Gruener alongside David Warthen, a consulting engineer, created a company called Ask Jeeves. After both investing over $250,000 they set up their office in Berkeley, California. Named after the butler in the stories by P.G. Wodehouse &quot;who had an answer to every problem&quot;, the firm provides software that operates in a &quot;question-and-answer&quot; format. In 1997, they made their product available for free on the Internet under the name Ask.com. The product utilizes syntactic and semantic analysis to answer the asked question through one of the around 10,000 basic formulas. It shows various versions of the question and allows the user to pick the desired one. In the beginning, the company employed around 40 workers who provided the users with the needed answer to their question. In 1998, the company made around $1 million profit for adverts on its website. In 2003, Gruener stepped out of the chairman position at Ask.com.

====Virtual Microsystems====
&quot;Virtual Microsystems Inc&quot; (VMI) software enabled running MS-DOS and CP/M application programs on Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s VAX minicomputers. As of mid-1988, &quot;Virtual Microsystems Inc&quot; (VMI) and &quot;Logicraft&quot; were &quot;the only commercially available products that let VAX/VMS systems run standard off-the-shelf PC applications from terminals and VAXstations.&quot; VMI&#x27;s &quot;The Bridge&quot; facilitated using the DEC machine&#x27;s hard disk, which in turn provided better backups than individualized floppy-based arrangements. &quot;The Bridge&quot; is slower than a top end PC; VMI&#x27;s &quot;Z-Board&quot; add-on matches that speed.

Other benefits included developing software for PCs and printing on DEC-attached high speed printers.

===Politics===
Gruener was a candidate for the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election from the Democratic Party. He was one of the candidates who aggressively used the Internet to push his message and also ran campaign ads in selected television markets. Eventually, Gruener finished 28th in a field of 135 candidates with 2,562 votes.

==Personal life==

Gruener is married to Amy Slater, an attorney and lecturer on the subject of negotiations and conflict resolution at the Goldman School of Public Policy and at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. They live in the Bay Area. Gruener is also a pilot.

<text>Pentatomidae is a family of insects belonging to the order Hemiptera, generally called shield bugs or stink bugs. Pentatomidae is the largest family in the superfamily Pentatomoidea, and contains around 900 genera and over 4700 species. As hemipterans, the pentatomids have piercing sucking mouthparts, and most are phytophagous, including several species which are severe pests on agricultural crops. However, some species, particularly in the subfamily Asopinae, are predatory and may be considered beneficial.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Pentatomidae&quot; is from the Greek &quot;pente&quot; meaning &quot;five&quot; and &quot;tomos&quot; meaning &quot;section&quot;, and refers to the five segments of their antennae. Pentatomids are generally called &quot;shield bugs&quot; in British English, or &quot;stink bugs&quot; in American English. However, the term shield bugs are also applied broadly to include several related families (e.g. Acanthosomatidae, Scutelleridae, and Cydnidae), or specifically only to refer to species in the family Acanthosomatidae. The term shield bug refers to the generalized body shape of adult bugs in these families which resembles a heraldic shield when viewed from above.

The American name &quot;stink bug&quot; is specific to the Pentatomidae, and refers to their ability to release a pungent defensive spray when threatened, disturbed, or crushed. The composition of this spray may vary between species, and even by sex or age, but generally includes aldehydes and alkanes. Descriptions of the smells vary widely, and include oily, dusty, woody and earthy, and like coriander. In some species, the liquid contains cyanide compounds and a rancid almond scent, used to protect themselves and discourage predators.

The term &quot;stink bug&quot; may also be a vernacular for unrelated insects such as pinacate beetles (in the genus &quot;Eleodes&quot;).

==Description==
All pentatomids have 5-segmented antennae, and 3 tarsal segments on each foot. They generally have a large triangular scutellum in the center of the back. The body shape of adult pentatomids is generally &quot;shieldlike,&quot; when viewed from above, but this varies between species, and is not true for the immature nymphal stages. The forewings of stink bugs are called hemelytra, with the basal half thickened while the apex is membranous. At rest, the wings are laid across the back of the insect, with the membranous wingtips overlapping. The hindwings are entirely membranous.

==Economics==
Several stink bugs and shield bugs are considered agricultural pests, because they can grow into large populations that feed on crops, damage production, and they are resistant to many pesticides. They are a threat to cotton, corn, sorghum, soybeans, native and ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, weeds, and many cultivated crops.

In Mexico, some species of stink bugs are called &quot;jumil&quot;, &quot;chinche de monte&quot;, &quot;xotlinilli&quot;, or &quot;chumil&quot; (e.g. &quot;Edessa mexicana&quot;). They are most often eaten in the states of Morelos and Guerrero. The flavor is sometimes said to resemble cinnamon, or sometimes a bitter medicinal flavor. &quot;Jumiles&quot; may be used for making sauces or as a taco filling.

Since its recent arrival in the U.S., the brown marmorated stink bug population has grown significantly. As of October 2014, brown marmorated stink bugs can be found in 41 out of 50 states within the U.S. In 2016 New Zealand&#x27;s MPI put out an alert to prevent this invasive species from entering via imported cargo.

=== Pest control and management ===
Changes in winter temperatures may exacerbate the threat posed by Pentatomidae pest species. Habitats that have been identified as suitable for Pentatomidae expansion, such as the Midwest region of the United States, are likely to be heavily impacted by the increased threat. Furthermore, temperature affects life table parameters, such as survival, development, reproduction, and daily mortality, which can impact a variety of crops depending on the injury stink bugs have on them.

As the effects of climate change increase the impacts of stinkbugs on crops, improving efficacy of existing controls and developing new solutions will be critical for pest control. Chemical control programs are commonly used to manage stink bugs, however, there is evidence of increasing insecticide resistance that will decrease the efficacy of these programs over time. Alternatives to insecticides include the removal of symbionts, using traps that disrupt stinkbug vibratory communication and chemical pheromone traps.

<text>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of Health and Social Care. 

As the national health technology assessment body of England, it is responsible for judging the cost-effectiveness of medicines and making them available on the NHS through reimbursement, with its judgements informing decisions in Wales and Northern Ireland. It also provides a range of clinical guidance to the NHS in England and Wales, which are considered by Northern Ireland. 

== History ==

=== Organisational history ===
It was set up as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in 1999, and on 1 April 2005 joined with the Health Development Agency to become the new National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (still abbreviated as NICE). Following the Health and Social Care Act 2012, NICE was renamed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on 1 April 2013 reflecting its new responsibilities for social care, and changed from a special health authority to an executive non-departmental public body (NDPB).

NICE was established in an attempt to end the so-called postcode lottery of healthcare in England and Wales, where availability of treatments depended on the NHS Health Authority area in which the patient happened to live, but it has since acquired a high reputation internationally as a role model for the development of clinical guidelines. One aspect of this is the explicit determination of cost–benefit boundaries for certain technologies that it assesses. NICE also plays an important role in pioneering technology assessment in other healthcare systems through NICE International, established in May 2008 to help cultivate links with foreign governments. NICE International has received financial support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation.

=== Policy history ===
The notion of an Institute to determine the clinical effectiveness of interventions first emerged at the end of John Major&#x27;s Conservative Government as moves elsewhere were being made to set professionally agreed standards for clinical care. In 1997, the UK National Screening Committee (NSC) had been established by Sir Kenneth Calman and Muir Gray (now Sir Muir Gray) by the Policy Team led by Timothy Riley for the Department of Health. The NSC aimed to ensure that evidence-based medicine informed policy making on what national screening programmes were approved for funding and what quality assurance mechanisms should be in place. This was a timely action as screening quality in breast cancer screening services came under question at Exeter in 1997 and followed in the wake of the 1995 Calman-Hine Report.

The idea of what was originally called the National Institute for Clinical Excellence took root when Labour came to power in 1997. Frank Dobson became Secretary of State and was supported by a team of Ministers keen on introducing clinical and health outcome measures to achieve improvements in the quality and delivery of care. The team included Alan Milburn, Baroness Margaret Jay, and Tessa Jowell. The name and mission was agreed in a meeting between the Ministerial team, Timothy Riley and Felicity Harvey shortly after the election and it was agreed that NICE should be described in the first policy white paper, The New NHS: Modern, Dependable 1997. Timothy Riley led the team that developed the policy and for NICE and which managed the legislation through Parliament in addition to implementing the new institute as a Special Health Authority. Timothy Riley joined Sir Michael Rawlins (the then recently appointed Chair of NICE) at the Health Select Committee in February 1999 where questions were raised as to whether NICE was just a means to &quot;ration&quot; healthcare. Sir Michael Rawlins and Timothy Riley presented a compelling case that positioned NICE as a standards setting body first and foremost.
However, the reality was that although NICE was principally aimed at aligning professional standards through clinical guidelines and audit, the acceptability of drugs, devices and technological interventions in defining those standards, could not be ignored and so the concept of a &quot;fourth hurdle&quot; for drugs accessing the NHS market was invoked. This controversial policy shift meant that NICE was critical for decisions on drug reimbursement. Indeed, the first drug appraisal by NICE was on the drug Relenza which was turned down amidst criticisms from Glaxo-Wellcome that the appraisal had been fast tracked. Later, this policy development whereby the criteria for decision making, the role of costs, and the degree to which decisions of NICE and the secretary of state would be binding on clinicians was analysed by Andrew Dillon, Trevor Gibbs, Timothy Riley, and Trevor A. Sheldon. As of 1 February 2022, its chief executive is Samantha Roberts, who succeeded Gillian Leng.

== Guidance ==
NICE publishes guidelines in four areas:
* the use of health technologies within England&#x27;s National Health Service (NHS) (such as the use of new and existing medicines, treatments and procedures)
* clinical practice (guidance on the appropriate treatment and care of people with specific diseases and conditions)
* guidance for public sector workers on health promotion and ill-health avoidance
* guidance for social care services and users.

These appraisals are based primarily on evidence-based evaluations of efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness in various circumstances.

=== Technology appraisals ===
Since January 2005, the NHS in England has been legally obliged to provide funding for medicines and treatments recommended by NICE&#x27;s technology appraisal board. This was at least in part as a result of well-publicised postcode lottery anomalies in which certain less-common treatments were funded in some parts of the UK but not in others due to local decision making in the NHS.

Before an appraisal, the Advisory Committee on Topic Selection draws up a list of potential topics of clinical significance for appraisal. The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care must then refer any technology so that the appraisal process can be formally initiated. Once this has been done NICE works with the Department of Health to draw up the scope of the appraisal.

NICE then invites consultee and commentator organisations to take part in the appraisal. A consultee organisation would include patient groups, organisations representing health care professionals and the manufacturers of the product undergoing appraisal. Consultees submit evidence during the appraisal and comment on the appraisal documents. Commentator organisations include the manufacturers of products to which the product undergoing appraisal is being compared. They comment on the documents that have been submitted and drawn up but do not actually submit information themselves.

An independent academic centre then draws together and analyses all of the published information on the technology under appraisal and prepares an assessment report. This can be commented on by the Consultees and Commentators. Comments are then taken into account and changes made to the assessment report to produce an evaluation report. An independent Appraisal Committee then looks at the evaluation report, hears spoken testimony from clinical experts, patient groups and carers. They take their testimony into account and draw up a document known as the &#x27;appraisal consultation document&#x27;. This is sent to all consultees and commentators who are then able to make further comments. Once these comments have been taken into account the final document is drawn up called the &#x27;final appraisal determination&#x27;. This is submitted to NICE for approval.

The process aims to be fully independent of government and lobbying power, basing decisions fully on clinical and cost-effectiveness. There have been concerns that lobbying by pharmaceutical companies to mobilise media attention and influence public opinion are attempts to influence the decision-making process. A fast-track assessment system has been introduced to reach decisions where there is most pressure for a conclusion.

=== Clinical guidelines ===
NICE carries out assessments of the most appropriate treatment regimes for different diseases. This must take into account both desired medical outcomes (i.e. the best possible result for the patient) and also economic arguments regarding differing treatments.

NICE has set up several National Collaborating Centres bringing together expertise from the royal medical colleges, professional bodies and patient/carer organisations which draw up the guidelines. The centres are the National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, the National Clinical Guideline Centre, the National Collaborating Centre for Women and Children´s Health, and the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health.

The National Collaborating Centre appoints a Guideline Development Group whose job it is to work on the development of the clinical guideline. This group consists of medical professionals, representatives of patient and carer groups and technical experts. They work together to assess the evidence for the guideline topic (e.g. clinical trials of competing products) before preparing a draft guideline. There are then two consultation periods in which stakeholder organisations are able to comment on the draft guideline. After the second consultation period, an independent Guideline Review Panel reviews the guideline and stakeholder comments and ensures that these comments have been taken into account. The Guideline Development Group then finalises the recommendations and the National Collaboration Centre produces the final guideline. This is submitted to NICE to formally approve the guideline and issue the guidance to the NHS. To date NICE has produced more than 200 different guidelines.

In October 2014 Andy Burnham said that a Labour government could reduce variation in access to drugs and procedures by making it mandatory for commissioners to follow NICE clinical guidelines. &quot;We need to look at how you strengthen NICE. Where they have said something is effective and affordable, on what basis does a local commissioner withhold that from somebody? I’m not comfortable with that. I don’t support that.&quot;

NICE has a service called Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS) which provides primary care practitioners with a readily accessible summary of the current evidence base and practical guidance.

In 2022 PricewaterhouseCoopers did a study for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry of 13 medicines recommended for asthma, kidney disease, stroke prevention and type 2 diabetes. They found that 1.2 million patients had not received the drugs which could have given them the equivalent of 429,000 extra years in “complete good health” which could have translated into £17.9bn in “productivity gains” for the British economy.

=== Social care guidance ===
Under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, NICE was given responsibility for developing guidance and quality standards for social care, using an evidence-based model. This was delivered by the NICE Collaborating Centre for Social Care (NCCSC), hosted by the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) and four partner organisations - Research in Practice, Research in Practice for Adults, Personal Social Services Research Unit and the EPPI-Centre. Over a five year period, the NCCSC developed social care guidelines and supported the implementation of both the guidelines and social care quality standards.

NICE received referrals for social care guidance from the Department of Health and the Department for Education, and commission the guidance from the NCCSC. NICE, along with the NCCSC, carried out a scoping exercise with a scoping group and with input from key stakeholders, at both a workshop and a public consultation, to ensure the guidance to be produced was focused and achievable. A chairperson and members of the Guidance Development Group were appointed, and posed review questions which enabled systematic evidence reviews to take place, thus delivering the guidance and subsequent recommendations. Service user and carer involvement took place throughout, as well as public consultation on the draft guidance.

The Guidance Development Group then finalised the recommendations and the NCCSC produced the final guideline. This was submitted to NICE for formal approval and publication. The entire process from pre-scoping to publication took approximately 24 months. The guidance was then available to NICE standing committees to develop a quality standard on the topic. The quality standard was developed using the guidance and other accredited sources, to produce high-level concise statements that can be used for quality improvement by social care providers and commissioners, as well as setting out what service users and carers can expect of high quality social care services.

The NCCSC is unique within NICE, in that it is the only collaborating centre to have responsibility for the adoption and dissemination support for guidance and quality standards in the social care arena. Drawing on the expertise of SCIE and their partners within the sector, each of the guidance products and quality standards had a needs assessment carried out to determine the requirements for tools to help embed the guidance and quality standards within the sector. These could include tailored versions of guidance for specific audiences, costing and commissioning tools and even training and learning packages.

As of August 2013, NICE and the NCCSC had scheduled guidance delivery for five topics: domiciliary care, older adults with long-term conditions, transition between health and social care settings, transition from children&#x27;s to adults&#x27; services and child abuse and neglect.

==Cost–effectiveness==

As with any system financing health care, the NHS has a limited budget and a vast number of potential spending options. Choices must be made as to how this limited budget is spent. Economic evaluations are carried out within a health technology assessment framework to compare the cost-effectiveness of alternative activities and to consider the opportunity cost associated with their decisions. By choosing to spend the finite NHS budget upon those treatment options that provide the most efficient results, society can ensure it does not lose out on possible health gains through spending on inefficient treatments and neglecting those that are more efficient.

NICE attempts to assess the cost–effectiveness of potential expenditures within the NHS to assess whether or not they represent &#x27;better value&#x27; for money than treatments that would be neglected if the expenditure took place. It assesses the cost–effectiveness of new treatments by analysing the cost and benefit of the proposed treatment relative to the next best treatment that is currently in use.

===Quality-adjusted life years===

NICE guidance supports the use of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) as the primary outcome for quantifying the expected health benefits associated with a given treatment regime. By comparing the present value (see discounting) of expected QALY flows with and without treatment, or relative to another treatment, the net/relative health benefit derived from such a treatment can be derived. When combined with the relative cost of treatment, this information can be used to estimate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is considered in relation to NICE&#x27;s threshold willingness-to-pay value.

As a guideline rule, NICE accepts as cost-effective those interventions with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than £20,000 per QALY and that there should be increasingly strong reasons for accepting as cost-effective interventions with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of over a threshold of £30,000 per QALY.

Over the years, there has been great controversy as to what value this threshold should be set at. Initially, there was no fixed number. But the appraisal teams created a consensus amount of about £30,000. However, in November 2008 Alan Johnson, the then Secretary of State, announced that for end-of-life cancer drugs the threshold could be increased above £30,000.

The first drug to go through the new process was lenalidomide, whose ICER was £43,800.

===Cost per quality-adjusted life year gained===

The following example from NICE explains the QALY principle and the application of the cost per QALY calculation.

A patient has a life-threatening condition and is expected to live on average for one year receiving the current best treatment which costs the NHS £3,000. A new drug becomes available that will extend the life of the patient by three months and improve his or her quality of life, but the new treatment will cost the NHS more than three times as much at £10,000. Patients score their perceived quality of life on a scale from 0 to 1 with 0 being worst possible health and 1 being best possible health. On the standard treatment, quality of life is rated with a score of 0.4 but it improves to 0.6 with the new treatment. Patients on the new treatment on average live an extra 3 months, so 1.25 years in total. The quality of life gained is the product of &quot;life span&quot; and &quot;quality rating&quot; with the new treatment less the same calculation for the old treatment, i.e. (1.25 x 0.6) less (1.0 x 0.4) = 0.35 QALY. The marginal cost of the new treatment to deliver this extra gain is £7,000 so the cost per quality life year gained is £7000/0.35 or £20,000. This is within the £20,000-£30,000 that is suggested by NICE to be the limit for drugs to be cost-effective.

If the patient was expected to live only one month extra and instead of three then NICE would issue a recommendation not to fund. The patient&#x27;s primary care trust could still decide to fund the new treatment, but if not, the patient would then have two choices. He or she could opt to take the free NHS standard treatment, or he or she may decide to pay out of pocket to obtain the benefit of the new treatment from a different health care provider. If the person has a private health insurance policy the person could check to see whether the private insurance provider will fund the new treatment. About 8% of the population has some private health insurance from an employer or trade association and 2% pay from their own resources.

===Basis of recommendations===

Theoretically, it might be possible to draw up a table of all possible treatments sorted by cost per QALY gained. Those treatments with lowest cost per QALY gained would appear at the top of the table and deliver the most benefit per value spent and would be easiest to justify funding for. Those where the delivered benefit is low and the cost is high would appear at the bottom of the list. Decision makers would, theoretically, work down the table, adopting services that are the most cost effective. The point at which the NHS budget is exhausted would reveal the shadow price, the threshold lying between the CQG (cost per QALY gained) of the last service that is funded and that of the next most cost effective service that is not funded.

In practice this exercise is not done, but an assumed shadow price has been used by NICE for many years in its assessments to determine which treatments the NHS should and should not fund. NICE states that for drugs the CQG should not normally exceed £30,000 but that there is not a hard threshold, though research has shown that any threshold is &quot;somewhat higher&quot; than being in the range £35,000 - £40,000.

The House of Commons Health Select Committee, in its report on NICE, stated in 2008 that &quot;the ... cost-per-QALY it uses to decide whether a treatment is cost-effective is of serious concern. The threshold it employs is not based on empirical research and is not directly related to the NHS budget, nor is it at the same level as that used by primary care trusts (PCTs) in providing treatments not assessed by NICE, which tends to be lower. Some witnesses, including patient organisations and pharmaceutical companies, thought NICE should be more generous in the cost per QALY threshold it uses, and should approve more products. On the other hand, some PCTs struggle to implement NICE guidance at the current threshold and other witnesses argued that a lower level should be used. However, there are many uncertainties about the thresholds used by PCTs.&quot; It went on to recommend that &quot;an independent body should determine the threshold used when making judgements of the value of drugs to the NHS.&quot;

==Criticism==

The work that NICE is involved in, attracts the attention of many groups, including doctors, the pharmaceutical industry, and patients. NICE is often associated with controversy, because the requirement to make decisions at a national level, can conflict with what is (or is believed to be) in the best interests of an individual patient.

Approved cancer drugs and treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy are funded by the NHS without any financial contribution being taken from the patient. Where NICE has approved a treatment, the NHS must fund it. But not all treatments have been assessed by NICE and these treatments are usually dependent on local NHS decision making. In the case of cancer the Cancer Drugs Fund was set up in 2011 after complaints about NICE decisions on new and expensive cancer drugs with limited benefits. Treatment for fertility problems are approved but not always funded by clinical commissioning groups and they may cap the number of rounds.

NICE has been criticised for being too slow to reach decisions. On one occasion, the Royal National Institute of Blind People said it was outraged over its delayed decision for further guidance regarding two drugs for macular degeneration that are already approved for use in the NHS. However the Department of Health said that it had &#x27;made it clear to PCTs that funding for treatments should not be withheld simply because guidance from NICE is unavailable&#x27;.

Some of the more controversial NICE decisions have concerned donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine (review) and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitinib and temsirolimus for renal cell carcinoma. All these are drugs with a high cost per treatment and NICE has either rejected or restricted their use in the NHS on the grounds that they are not cost-effective.

A statement published by the Royal College of Physicians expressed concern that the 2021 NICE guidelines for ME/CFS did not properly evaluate or recommend graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of ME/CFS. A study by 49 academics argued that the dissonance between the 2021 guidelines and the previous guideline was the result of deviating from usual scientific standards of the NICE process. NICE responded that they did follow the standard GRADE approach, and evidence from unblinded trials with subjective outcomes was appropriately downgraded.

A Conservative shadow minister once criticized NICE for spending more on communications than assessments. In its defence, NICE said the majority of its communications budget was spent informing doctors about which drugs had been approved and new guidelines for treatments and that the actual cost of assessing new drugs for the NHS includes money spent on NICE&#x27;s behalf by the Department of Health. When these were added to NICE&#x27;s own costs, the total cost of the technology appraisal programme far outstrips the cost of NICE communications.

A report from the University of York Centre for Health Economics written by Karl Claxton in February 2015 suggested that the maximum threshold, currently around £30,000 a year, for judging a medicine cost-effective should be more than halved. They found that any intervention costing more than £13,000 per quality-adjusted life year risked causing more harm than good by denying cost effective treatment to other patients.

The institute&#x27;s approach to the introduction of new oral therapy for hepatitis C has been criticised. Sofosbuvir was approved in 2015. It costs about £30,000 for 12 weeks treatment. NHS England established 22 Operational Delivery Networks to roll out delivery and proposes to fund 10,000 courses of treatment in 2016-17. Each has been given a “run rate” of how many patients they are allowed to treat. This is the NHS’ single biggest new treatment investment this year. In the North East London network patients with cirrhosis or fibrosis go to the front of the queue and three new patients at the Grahame Hayton Unit at the Royal London Hospital start treatment each month. Those without such complications may faced considerable delays before they start treatment.

<doc id="429681" wikidata="Q1547740" url="?curid=429681" title="Nothingface (band)">
<text>Nothingface was an American nu metal band from Washington, D.C., formed in 1994. Their best-known and most prolific line-up consisted of Matt Holt (vocals), Tom Maxwell (guitar), Bill Gaal (bass) and Chris Houck (drums). They disbanded in 2004, only to reform the following year, reuniting with Gaal and Houck, and then disband four years later. In 2017, Holt died from a degenerative disease.

The band released four studio albums: &quot;Pacifier&quot; (1997), &quot;An Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity&quot; (1998), &quot;Violence&quot; (2000) and &quot;Skeletons&quot; (2003), achieving moderate success, as evidenced by their 2001 single &quot;Bleeder&quot; peaking at number 32 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Chart and touring with high-profile acts such as Soulfly, Pantera, and Ministry, as well as the Tattoo the Earth and Ozzfest 2003 tours. Nothingface&#x27;s studio albums have collectively sold a total of over half a million copies worldwide.

==History==
===Early days (1994–1995)===
Nothingface was originally formed in early 1994. The band&#x27;s original line-up consisted of vocalist David Gabbard, guitarist Tom Maxwell, bassist Bill Gaal and drummer Chris Houck. The band started when Chris Houck put an ad out in a local magazine called Rox Magazine in Baltimore. Tom Maxwell, who was living in Baltimore at the time, contacted Chris about the ad, and said he was interested in getting together and jamming. Tom sent a tape with music that he had been working on. Chris, who was living with Bill Gaal at the time in Damascus, Maryland, got the tape and they were both impressed with what Tom had sent. From there they got together and jammed on covers of Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Jane&#x27;s Addiction and clicked.
They released three tapes with this lineup. These demos featured a grunge and hard rock-influenced sound, in contrast to the heavy metal sound the band would become renowned for later on in their career. Gabbard left the band in 1995, due to disagreements over the heavier musical direction Nothingface was heading in. At this point Matt Holt took over singing duties. Matt Holt became a part of the band as a result of Ingredient 17 (Matt and Tommy Sickles&#x27; band) who had been recording at Chris and Bill&#x27;s house in Damascus. Tom Maxwell heard the material Matt had been doing with Ingredient 17 and thought Matt would be a good match to replace Dave. According to Maxwell, this lineup of Nothingface came together on May 5, 1995. 

===&quot;Pacifier&quot; and &quot;An Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity&quot; (1996–1999)===
The band then recorded a 1995 self-titled album featuring ten songs. DCide then discovered Nothingface, and in 1996, they partially re-recorded the album, with six of the songs featured on their debut album &quot;Pacifier&quot;, released in February 1997.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;An Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity&quot; was released on September 22, 1998, via Mayhem Records. The band toured in support of the album throughout the United States with Stuck Mojo, Sam Black Church, Helmet and Ministry.

===&quot;Violence&quot; (2000–2002)===
Two years later, the band released their third album &quot;Violence&quot; on October 10, 2000. It featured a single called &quot;Bleeder&quot; which peaked at number 32 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The album also peaked at 24 on the Heatseekers Chart and 37 on the Top Independent Chart. It was the band&#x27;s most successful album, and their first under the semi-major label TVT Records. Chris Houck recorded drums for this album but had to leave the group due to medical issues that would prevent him from touring. He was replaced by Tommy Sickles of Ingredient 17 (Matt and Tommy&#x27;s band before Nothingface).

In early 2001, Bill Gaal left the group to pursue a career in music production and engineering. He was replaced by Jerry Montano, formerly of &quot;The Deadlights&quot;. A few months later, Gaal returned. During the 2001–02 interval between &quot;Violence&quot; and their next album, Nothingface experienced significant turmoil when lead singer Matt Holt&#x27;s home burned down, Tom Maxwell&#x27;s mother dying and bassist Bill Gaal divorcing his wife, leading to the band nearly breaking up.

===&quot;Skeletons&quot; and breakup (2003–2004)===
The band released their fourth album &quot;Skeletons&quot; on April 22, 2003, via TVT Records. The album is considered their most diverse, featuring some of the band&#x27;s heaviest as well as most melodic material. That summer, the band played on the second-stage of the popular Ozzfest tour. However, the band dropped off Ozzfest shortly before it ended due to numerous factors, including voice issues experienced by Matt Holt. Nothingface disbanded on February 10, 2004, citing musical differences and lack of support from their label.

===Reformation and second breakup (2005–2009)===

On November 24, 2005, a posting on the Jägermeister website showed Nothingface as the opening act for Disturbed in a 2006 show. The line-up for this show was Matt Holt, Tom Maxwell, Jerry Montano and Tommy Sickles. The band released two new songs online and went on to do a small U.S. club tour that winter/spring, bringing along Crossbreed and Silent Civilian. Jerry Montano was fired from the band after allegedly assaulting Tom Maxwell and making gun threats at Hellyeah&#x27;s debut album party.

During the first half of April 2008, the band sent out a Myspace bulletin and changed their default profile picture to one of the band in the studio, signaling that they were indeed working on new material. On May 20, they posted a short YouTube clip which features them performing and sent out a Myspace bulletin containing said clip. Four days later, on May 24, it was announced through Blabbermouth.net that original members Bill Gaal and Chris Houck had rejoined Nothingface. with Tommy Sickles now playing drums for the L.A.-based band Noise Within. The band then released several additional &quot;teaser&quot; videos and on February 19, 2009, announced that &quot;the band is at Wrightway Studios in Baltimore MD for the next 2 weeks writing and recording.&quot; The re-release of their self-titled album with remastered songs and new artwork was released on April 8, 2009.

On August 14, 2009, it was announced via Blabbermouth.net that Nothingface would be disbanding again. On September 1, 2009, the band released &quot;One Thousand Lies&quot; on their official website. It is a rough &quot;first draft&quot; demo and was recorded in March 2008. On November 13, 2009, the band uploaded &quot;D2&quot; which is another rough &quot;first draft&quot; demo with no vocals. In early 2011, the band launched their brand new website Nothingface.com. Videos linked to YouTube were present so was a Nothingface wiki, forum, guest book, photo gallery and a section for fans to upload their own videos of Nothingface music. Links to other bands were present also. The website has since been suspended for unknown reasons.

===Aftermath and death of Matt Holt (2010–2017)===

In a Talk Toomey podcast interview on October 3, 2016, former guitarist Tom Maxwell stated that a Nothingface reunion is &quot;not gonna happen&quot; and that he and Holt &quot;don&#x27;t get along&quot;. Maxwell elaborated by stating that &quot;there&#x27;s just nothing anymore. There&#x27;s no communication, there&#x27;s no desire.&quot;

On April 15, 2017, Matt Holt died aged 39 from a degenerative disease. On May 6, 2017, Maxwell, Gaal and Tommy Sickles reunited at a Knives Out! concert to perform the Nothingface song &quot;For All the Sin&quot; (with Todd Smith of Dog Fashion Disco on vocals) as a tribute to Holt.

==Other projects==

Bill Gaal went on to form Kingdom of Snakes with former members of the band Gunfighter. Their debut EP features vocal work from Matt Holt on one track. In early 2004, Gaal and Holt announced the formation of a new band called Perfect Enemy, while Tom Maxwell and Tommy Sickles announced the formation of Coldwhitechrist with Jerry Montano and Chad Gray, whose tenure was short-lived due to prior commitments. The trio later announced the formation of Sever, which later became Blessed in Black and also included ex-Skrape vocalist Billy Keeton. Keeton eventually left in late 2005 and the band dissolved.

In 2005, guitarist Tom Maxwell and then-bassist Jerry Montano began a band called Hellyeah with Vinnie Paul, formerly of Pantera and Damageplan, as well as Chad Gray and Greg Tribbett of Mudvayne. They released their debut album on April 10, 2007, via Epic Records. After making drunken gun-threats at the album release party, Jerry Montano was subsequently fired from Hellyeah.

==Musical style and influences==
Nothingface has been most commonly described as alternative metal and nu metal. The band&#x27;s first album &quot;Pacifier&quot; in 1997 featured a sound that was compared to nu metal band Korn. Some critics described it as a &quot;Korn clone&quot;. Although with their second album &quot;An Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity&quot;, they abandoned that sound and featured the nu metal sound they became known for, continuing on their next releases. Some critics deny that Nothingface is a nu metal band due to their use of guitar solos and absence of elements from hip-hop and other characteristics featured in nu metal. The band&#x27;s sound consists of aggressive heavy metal guitar riffs, screamed vocals, and melodic singing. Singer Matt Holt&#x27;s melodic and grunge-esque singing has been compared to Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and the vocals of Alice in Chains. Critics have praised Holt&#x27;s singing style for being able to mix harshness with accessibility. Jennifer Slivka of the &quot;Daily Collegian&quot;, noting that Nothingface &quot;don&#x27;t rap&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t sound like Korn&quot;, distinguished Nothingface from the band&#x27;s contemporaries: &quot;Their music is loud and aggressive, recalling more of the older metal bands like Pantera. However, there are many times when the melody will shift midway through a song, giving way to vocal harmonies much like that of Alice in Chains.&quot; In 1999, Paul Lee of &quot;Lollipop&quot;, categorizing Nothingface as metalcore, described the band as &quot;Earth Crisis-meets-Fugazi&quot;. Lee also wrote that Nothingface &quot;have chops comparable to Rush or King Crimson.&quot;

Matt Holt cites Maryland heavy metal bands Dog Fashion Disco, Spirit Caravan, and Meatjack as influences. Tom Maxwell came from the Baltimore heavy metal scene. Holt and Tommy Sickles &quot;came from more of the D.C. indie, straight-edge kind of thing, where&quot; the two of them would see bands like Fugazi and other bands signed to Dischord Records. Holt&#x27;s other influences also include Clutch, Minor Threat, Bad Brains, and Shudder to Think. Holt also said that Nothingface&#x27;s &quot;influences range from Patsy Cline to Slayer&quot;. He then said: &quot;We listen to a lot of music and very little of it is what would be termed &#x27;heavy&#x27; music.&quot;

<doc id="429690" wikidata="Q304539" url="?curid=429690" title="Sandbar shark">
<text>The sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus), also known as the brown shark or thickskin shark, is a species of requiem shark, and part of the family Carcharhinidae, native to the Atlantic Ocean and the Indo-Pacific. It is distinguishable by its very high first dorsal fin and interdorsal ridge. It is not to be confused with the similarly named sand tiger shark, or &quot;Carcharias taurus.&quot;

==Description and growth==
The sandbar shark is one of the largest coastal sharks in the world, and is closely related to the dusky shark, the bignose shark, and the bull shark. Its dorsal fin is triangular and very high, and it has very long pectoral fins. Sandbar sharks usually have heavy-set bodies and rounded snouts that are shorter than the average shark&#x27;s snout. Its upper teeth have broadly uneven cusps with sharp edges. Its second dorsal fin and anal fin are close to the same height.

Females can grow to 2–2.5 m (6.6–8.2 ft), males up to 1.8 m (5.9 ft). The maximum recorded weight is 240 kg (530 lb). Female sandbar sharks have an average fork-length (tip of the nose to fork in the tail) of 154.9 cm with the males&#x27; average fork-length being 151.6 cm. Its body color can vary from a blue-ish brown, grey or bronze, with a white or pale underside. Sandbar sharks swim alone or gather in sex-segregated schools that vary in size.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The sandbar shark, true to its nickname, is commonly found over muddy or sandy bottoms in shallow coastal waters such as bays, estuaries, harbors, or the mouths of rivers, but it also swims in deeper waters (200 m or more) as well as intertidal zones. Sandbar sharks are found in tropical to temperate waters worldwide; in the western Atlantic they range from Massachusetts to Brazil. Juveniles are common to abundant in the lower Chesapeake Bay, and nursery grounds are found from Delaware Bay to South Carolina. Other nursery grounds include Bonjuk Bay in Marmaris, Muğla/Turkey and the Florida Keys.

== Predators and diet ==
Natural predators of the sandbar shark include the tiger shark and, rarely, great white sharks.

The sandbar shark itself preys on fish, rays, crabs, and molluscs. They have also been found to primarily consume osteichthyes, or bony fish, octopuses, european squid, and cuttlefish when in areas such as the Mediterranean or the Gulf of Gabés. Sandbar sharks have been described as being a top predator in their ecosystem&#x27;s food chain. 

==Maturity and reproduction==
There are disagreements about when exactly sandbar sharks reach sexual maturity, but most studies conclude that females reach sexual maturity around 13 years of age, while males tend to reach maturity around age 12 years old. Sandbar sharks are viviparous, with the embryos supported in placental yolk sac inside the mother. Females have been found to exhibit both biennial, consistently reproducing every two years and returning to the same place to have deliver the pup, and triennial, reproducing every three years and returning to the same place for delivery, migration and gestation periods. They also ovulate in early summer, and give birth to an average of eight pups, which they carry for 1 year before giving birth. The longevity of the sandbar shark is typically 35–41 years.

== Interactions with humans ==

===Fishing restrictions===
Sandbar sharks have been disproportionately targeted by the U.S. commercial shark fisheries in recent decades due to their high fin-to-body weight ratio, and U.S. fishing regulation requiring carcasses to be landed along with shark fins. In 2008, the National Marine Fisheries Service banned all commercial landings of sandbar sharks based on a 2006 stock assessment by SEDAR, and sandbar sharks were listed as vulnerable, due to overfishing. Currently, a small number of specially permitted vessels fish for sandbar sharks for the purpose of scientific research. All vessels in the research fishery are required to carry an independent researcher while targeting sandbars.

===Danger to people===
In spite of their large size and similar appearance to other dangerous sharks such as bull sharks, sandbar sharks are not considered to be dangerous to people. Very few attacks are attributed to sandbar sharks. As a result, they are considered one of the safest sharks to swim with and are popular sharks for aquaria. However, on August 2, 2021, a 12-year-old girl was bitten on her leg by a sandbar shark in Ocean City, Maryland, United States. This was confirmed by Ocean City authorities on August 5, 2021. The victim required 42 stitches.

== Immune system studies ==
Immune system genes, specifically MHC genes, are under study to understand the adaptive immune system in sharks such as the sandbar. Sandbars contain MHC class I, MHC class IIα, and class IIβ genes. Shark MHC genes are known to be similar to tetrapod rather than fish. Similarities include the lack of cysteines in class IIα1 domains in tetrapods and carcharhinids. Also, there are a fewer number of classical loci in sharks and tetrapods, when compared to other animals.

== Conservation status ==
The New Zealand Department of Conservation has classified the sandbar shark as &quot;Data Deficient&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

<text>The National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame was founded in 1950 in Saratoga Springs, New York, to honor the achievements of American Thoroughbred race horses, jockeys, and trainers. In 1955, the museum moved to its current location on Union Avenue near Saratoga Race Course, at which time inductions into the hall of fame began. Each spring, following the tabulation of the final votes, the announcement of new inductees is made, usually during Kentucky Derby Week in early May. The actual inductions are held in mid-August during the Saratoga race meeting.

The Hall of Fame&#x27;s nominating committee selects eight to ten candidates from among the four Contemporary categories (colts and horses, fillies and mares, jockey and trainer) to be presented to the voters. Changes in voting procedures that commenced with the 2010 candidates allow the voters to choose multiple candidates from a single Contemporary category, instead of a single candidate from each of the four Contemporary categories. For example, in 2016, two mares (Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta) were inducted at the same time.

The museum also houses a large collection of art, artifacts, and memorabilia that document the history of horse racing from the eighteenth century to the present.

==History==
The National Museum of Racing was founded in 1950, led by Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney and a group of people interested in thoroughbred racing. The museum first opened its doors in 1951, at which time it occupied a single room in Saratoga&#x27;s Canfield Casino. The establishment was supported by the city of Saratoga Springs, which donated $2,500, the Saratoga Racing Association, which donated $5,000, and various patrons of the sport, who also donated various pieces of art and memorabilia. The first item in the museum&#x27;s collection was a horseshoe worn by the great Lexington.

In 1955, the museum relocated to its current location on Union Avenue, across the street from the main entrance of the historic Saratoga Race Course. The museum was relocated to a newly reconstructed building and a thoroughbred racing Hall of Fame was included. Since then, the museum has expanded several times to allow for the display of its extensive art collection and more multimedia displays on the history of the sport.

==Horses in the Hall of Fame==

In the early years, inductions to the hall of fame were based on the evaluation of a panel of racing historians. In 1955, a group of nine horses from the earliest years of the American turf were inducted. The 1956 class included 11 horses that raced around the turn of the century, while the 1957 class included 10 horses that raced up to the mid-thirties. Since then, the classes have been significantly smaller as the inductions shifted to more contemporary horses. Under current rules, a horse must have been retired for a minimum of five full calendar years to be eligible for the hall of fame. (Exceptions to this rule have been made; for example, Secretariat was inducted the year after his retirement and Ruffian was inducted the year after her death.) Thoroughbreds remain eligible in the contemporary category between five and 25 calendar years following their final racing year. Thoroughbreds retired for more than 25 calendar years may become eligible through the Historic Review Committee.

==Jockeys in the Hall of Fame==
Contemporary jockeys become eligible for the Hall of Fame after they have been licensed for at least 20 years, and remain eligible until 25 years after retirement. In special circumstances such as fragile health, the 20 year requirement may be waived, though there is usually a five-year waiting period after retirement in such cases.

==Trainers in the Hall of Fame==
Contemporary trainers become eligible for the Hall of Fame after they have been licensed for at least 25 years, and remain eligible until 25 years after retirement. In special circumstances such as fragile health, the 25 year requirement may be waived though there is usually a five-year waiting period after retirement in such cases.

==Exemplars of Racing==

==Pillars of the Turf==
Established in 2013, the Hall of Fame states that the Pillars of the Turf category honors those &quot;who have made extraordinary contributions to Thoroughbred racing in a leadership or pioneering capacity at the highest national level.&quot;
==Museum Exhibits==
In addition to the Hall of Fame, the museum houses numerous exhibits. These include:

* The Link Gallery, which features a bronze statue, &quot;Seasick&quot;, and a rotating selection of paintings
* The Sculpture Gallery, which features work by June Harrah, Herbert Haseltine, Marilyn Newmark, Jim Reno, John Skeaping and Eleanor Iselin Wade, among others. The gallery looks out onto the inner courtyard, which features a life-size bronze of Secretariat by Skeaping
* The Colonial Gallery, which covers the ocean transportation of horses and the foundations of American racing
* The Pre-Civil War Gallery, covering the expansion of racing during the early 19th century
* The Post-Civil War Gallery, covering the continued expansion of racing after the Civil War until a backlash to gambling in the early 20th century led to the closure of many tracks
* The 20th Century Gallery, which covers more recent topics
* The Eclipse Gallery, featuring award-winning entries from the Eclipse Award photography competition
* The Racing Day Gallery, which features displays about jockeys, odds and the Breeders&#x27; Cup
* The Anatomy Room, covering the breeding and biology of the Thoroughbred
* The Triple Crown Gallery, including information and artifacts related to Triple Crown history
* The Steeplechase Gallery, covering the history of steeplechase racing in America
* The von Stade Gallery, which displays a selection of paintings, works on paper, or photographic prints from the Museum Collection
* The Peter McBean Gallery, which houses temporary exhibitions, a semi-permanent Hall of Fame Heroes exhibition and seasonal exhibitions. It also houses a collection bequeathed by John Nerud, including trophies and paintings of the Hall of Fame horses he trained, Gallant Man and Dr. Fager

The Museum Collection includes just over 300 paintings. These range from paintings of the early days of racing in England by John E. Ferneley Sr. to more contemporary champions by Richard Stone Reeves. Featured artists include: William Smithson Broadhead, Vaughn Flannery, Sir Alfred J. Munnings, Frederic Remington, Martin Stainforth, George Stubbs, Henry Stull, Edward Troye and Franklin Brooke Voss. Also on display are Kelso&#x27;s five Jockey Club Gold Cup trophies and the Triple Crown trophies of Count Fleet.

<doc id="429693" wikidata="Q2865187" url="?curid=429693" title="Arthur Kill">
<text>The Arthur Kill (sometimes referred to as the Staten Island Sound) is a tidal strait in the New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary between Staten Island (also known as Richmond County), New York, and Union and Middlesex counties, New Jersey. It is a major navigational channel of the Port of New York and New Jersey.

== Etymology ==
The name Arthur Kill is an anglicization of the Dutch &quot;achter kill&quot; meaning &quot;back channel&quot;, which would refer to its location &quot;behind&quot; Staten Island and has its roots in the early 17th century during the Dutch colonial era when the region was part of New Netherland. Placenaming by early explorers and settlers during the era often referred to a location in reference to other places, its shape, its topography, and other geographic qualities. &quot;Kill&quot; comes from the Middle Dutch word &quot;kille&quot;, meaning &quot;riverbed&quot;, &quot;water channel&quot;, or &quot;stream&quot;. The area around the Newark Bay was called Achter Kol. During the British colonial era the bay was known as &quot;Cull bay&quot;. The bay lies behind Bergen Hill, the emerging ridge of the Hudson Palisades which begins on Bergen Neck, the peninsula between it and the Upper New York Bay. The sister channel of Arthur Kill, Kill van Kull, refers to the waterway that flows from the &quot;col&quot; or &quot;ridge&quot; or &quot;passage&quot; to the interior and translates as &quot;channel from the pass&quot; or &quot;ridge&quot;.

== Geography and geology==

The channel is approximately long and connects Raritan Bay on its south end with Newark Bay on the north. Along the New Jersey side it is primarily lined with industrial sites, part of which is called the Chemical Coast. The Staten Island side is primarily lined with salt marshes and is home to the Staten Island boat graveyard. It creates a border for Fresh Kills Landfill and Freshkills Park.

===Course===

Arthur Kill is an abandoned river channel carved by an ancestral phase of the Hudson River resulting from the blockage of the main channel of the Hudson at the Narrows by moraine or an ice dam. The size of Arthur Kill channel is large, suggesting that it was, for a time, the primary drainage from the region. However, it could not have been primary drainage for long because the river did not have enough time to carve a broad flood plain.

Because of the complex nature of the tides in New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary near the mouth of the Hudson River, the hydrology of Arthur Kill is still an open subject. In particular, the net flow of the channel is not well established. It was heavily polluted in the 1960s and 1970s, with few fish species able to live in it. Since the 1990s, crabs, baitfish, striped bass, and bluefish have returned to this water.

===Tributaries and islands===
Arthur Kill contains two small uninhabited islands, Prall&#x27;s Island and the Isle of Meadows, both of which are part of the borough of Staten Island. John&#x27;s Cove is located near its northern end in New Jersey.

On the New Jersey side, the Elizabeth River, Rahway River, Morses Creek, and Piles Creek flow into the kill. The Passaic River and Hackensack River mouth at Newark Bay. On the Staten Island side, Old Place Creek, Fresh Kills (an estuary fed by the Richmond Creek and Main Creek), Bridge Creek (off Goethal Pond), and Sawmill Creek flow into the estuary.

==Shipping==

The channel is dredged periodically to a depth of and a width of to maintain its usefulness for commercial ship passage. As part of its Harboring Deepening Project, the Kill is being deepened to a depth of to accommodate larger ships and allow for their passage while carrying full loads.

A heavily used marine channel, it provides access for ocean-going tankers to industrial facilities along the channel itself. The Howland Hook Marine Terminal is located at its mouth at Newark Bay. It provided the primary marine access to the now-closed Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island and is the location of the Staten Island boat graveyard. The Arthur Kill Terminal is a proposed offshore wind port.

==Crossings==

Arthur Kill is spanned by the Goethals Bridge and the Outerbridge Crossing, as well as by the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge, a railroad bridge and the largest bridge of its type in the United States.

For many years the Kill was traversed by a ferry between Tottenville and the Perth Amboy Ferry Slip. Another ferry ran from the tip of Victory Boulevard in Travis to Carteret. Re-introduction ferry service between Carteret&#x27;s Waterfront Park and Midtown Manhattan via Arthur Kill and Kill van Kull is planned. As of 2021, funding for the construction of a landing dock and purchase of a boat was in place.

==History==
The Arthur Kill was a critical dividing line during the American Revolution, with the British holding Staten Island for the duration of the conflict while New Jersey remained largely in Continental hands. Numerous skirmishes, including the Battle of Staten Island, spanned the Arthur Kill.

The Pilgrim Pipeline, to pipe crude oil, kerosene, and diesel fuel through New York and New Jersey was proposed to terminate at the Linden side of the kill.

<text>Arthur Louis Day (October 30, 1869 – March 2, 1960) was an American geophysicist and volcanologist. He studied high temperature thermometry, seismology and geothermal energy.

==Early life==
Day was born in Brookfield, Massachusetts and received his A.B. from Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in 1892. He earn his Ph.D from Sheffield in 1894, and taught at Yale until 1897. Day received an honorary doctorate from the University of Groningen (The Netherlands) on July 1, 1914.

==Career==
In 1894 and 1895 he worked with German physicist Friedrich Kohlrausch studying the conductive properties of electrolytes. From 1897 to 1900 he worked at Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Berlin and began his study of thermometry.

He worked with the U.S. Geological Survey from 1900 to 1907 studying the properties of rocks and minerals at very high and low temperatures. Day served as the director of the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution for Science from 1907 until his retirement in 1936. From 1933 to 1941 he served as vice president of the National Academy of Sciences. He was president of The Geological Society of America in 1938.

Following his retirement, he traveled to New Zealand to continue his study of seismology and geothermal energy. He studied the area&#x27;s volcanic areas until he had to stop his research in 1946 due to poor health.

He died on March 2, 1960, in Washington, D.C.

==Awards and legacy==
Day was awarded the John Scott Medal, the Wollaston Medal, the Penrose Medal, the Bakhuis Roozeboom Medal and the William Bowie Medal.

Day was elected to both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1912.

In 1948, Day established the Arthur L. Day Medal through the Geological Society of America. The medal is for &quot;outstanding distinction in contributing to geologic knowledge through the application of physics and chemistry to the solution of geologic problems&quot;.

==Family life==
Day was the son of Daniel P. and Fanie (Hobbs) Day. In 1900, he married Helen Kohlrausch, daughter of physicist Friedrich Kohlrausch. Day and his wife had four children: Margaret, Dorothy, Helen and Ralph. In 1933, he married Ruth Sarah Easling. They had no children together.

<text>The Weekly Worker is a newspaper published by the Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee) (CPGB-PCC). The paper is known on the left for its polemical articles, and for its close attention to Marxist theory and the politics of other Marxist groups. It claims a weekly online readership averaging over 20,000, Weekly Worker simultaneously also distributes 500 physical copies a week.

== Outlook ==

The CPGB-PCC&#x27;s declared intention is to emulate &quot;Iskra&quot; in providing Marxist analysis of politics and organisation to an initial vanguard of the working class. The &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; is integral to the CPGB-PCC&#x27;s identity, given that the party, probably dialectically, does not consider itself to be a Marxist party. It aims instead to have the paper provide a focus for Communist organisation and theory that will be absorbed by a Marxist party that will arrive in a time of greater working-class activism.

The paper has a policy of printing a variety of viewpoints. For example, it has printed articles by the Revolutionary Democratic Group (RDC) over a significant part of the paper&#x27;s history. The paper has also given columns to factions within the CPGB-PCC, notably the Red Platform faction during a debate over the CPGB-PCC&#x27;s stance towards the newly founded Respect. The &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; is known for its reporting of the activities of other left-wing groups, with a particular focus on the Socialist Workers Party and the Alliance for Workers&#x27; Liberty. Critics regard this as trading in gossip and amounting to sectarianism, a charge inverted by the CPGB-PCC.

The paper prides itself on publishing a variety of letters, including critical ones. This has often resulted in lengthy debates being conducted through the letters section, leading to a set of familiar names appearing repeatedly.

The paper has also attracted many activists who are not members of the CPGB-PCC to write articles. Leading UK gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, former Soviet dissident Boris Kagarlitsky, Marxist scholar Hillel Ticktin (editor of the magazine &quot;&quot; and Graham Bash of &quot;Labour Left Briefing&quot; have been regular contributors.

== Structure ==
The paper is typically around sixteen pages long (after having been eight pages long until the mid-1990s). Rarely it incorporates publications by other attached groups such as Communist Students. The basic structure is:
* Front Page: typically of magazine format, with a large striking image and overlaid text. The image tends to be artistic: examples include Hieronymus Bosch&#x27;s &quot;The Garden of Earthly delights&quot; to a picture of Barack Obama titled &quot;World&#x27;s No 1&#x27; Terrorist&quot;
* Letters Page: one or two pages of letters sent to the paper during the week.
* Action Column: a column containing upcoming events
* News: the next few pages typically contain Marxist interpretation of World News
* Left Politics: this tends to be followed by articles outlining developments with the left-wing political sphere
* Theory and Reviews: towards the end of the paper there are articles dealing theoretical issues in Marxism, historical points and reviews of recent plays books etc.
* Final News Item: the paper typically ends with a Marxist interpretation and response to a world event.

The paper runs a weekly section &#x27;What we Fight for&#x27; outlining in bullet point the core programme of the CPGB-PCC.

It also has a &quot;Fighting Fund&quot; section, where &quot;Robbie Rix&quot; encourages readers into donating to the paper while providing an update on readership levels. In September 2008 the paper decided to increase its monthly fund raising targets from £500 per month to £1,000. The party is reasonably successful in raising these small, for political party, amounts. The Fighting fund is replaced during the main fund raising drive, the Summer Offensive, with updates on the offensive. Typically the party set themselves the task of raising around £25,000. The paper vigorously denies other sources of funding, priding itself on being solely funded by the membership of the party and readership.

== Production ==
The &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; developed out of &quot;The Leninist&quot;. After the transition to becoming the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; the party succeeded in buying its own printing press. The machine was also operated by a party member, Phil Kent, giving the party complete control over publishing, something it considered integral to its independence. The paper was for the 1990s a large broadsheet printed in black and red, although towards the end of the decade the paper started to develop a web presence. As the new millennium moved on the online version of the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; became more important, till print readership became a small fraction of the total readership.

In 2008 the party&#x27;s press broke irreversibly. After considering stopping print publication altogether the party decided to focus on web publication but attempt to develop the facilities to print an A4 version of the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot;. The party has been involved in its archive of both the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; and &quot;The Leninist&quot;, whilst modernising and overhauling its website.

Back issues of &quot;The Leninist&quot; were published online in July 2012. In May 2014, the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; moved to a website separate from the party website.

== History ==
The paper was first published in 1993, having developed out of &quot;The Leninist&quot;, the eponymous underground publication of the left group opposed to the Euro-communist leadership of the by then dissolved Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). The group was defined by their adherence to orthodox Soviet Marxism and their strong opposition to Euro-communism within the former CPGB. This found primary expression in their stance towards the Soviet Union, where they denounced Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms and the developments within the Warsaw Pact. The party&#x27;s position was as rigorous to lead the group to publish denouncements of the Polish Solidarność trade union for agitation against the workers regime. Such positioning was charactured by the nickname &quot;Tankies&quot;.

&quot;The Leninist&quot; had a convoluted path to publication. After a factional confrontation with the then Euro-communist leaning leadership, a group called the New Communist Party (NCP) split from the CPGB in 1977. An event later regretted as premature and having been a move away from the real site of class struggle, the CPGB. A part of the NCP engaged close alliance with the Communist Party of Turkey (CPT), which left a lasting influence on the groups philosophy. A result of this contact with an active and intellectually lively communist organisation was disillusionment with the inadequacies of the NCP. Another split followed, leading to six joining the CPT and becoming active members. After a period of years this small grouplet, headed by John Chamberlain, decided that they should refocus on Britain&#x27;s political situation. The group now numbering four members, began a two-year period of Marxist study with the aiming to &quot;reforge the CPGB&quot;. These two years of study finally culminated in the publication of the first edition of &quot;The Leninist&quot;.

After the dissolution of the CPGB, the group around &quot;The Leninist&quot; declared their intention to reforge the party on what they declared to be &quot;firm Leninist principles&quot;. They organised an &quot;emergency conference&quot;, at which they claimed the CPGB name, but not its assets. The group are technically named the CPGB-PCC but commonly known as just the CPGB. They are distinct from the Communist Party of Britain, which has the electoral rights to the Communist Party name, and the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist). After having made this transition the group began the first publication of the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; shortly after in 1993 and began its attempts to &#x27;reforge the CPGB&#x27;.

The 1990s marked a period of introspection for the group. The nature of the Soviet Union was reappraised as being Stalinist, however the group reaffirmed their Leninist heritage (as opposed to the Trotskyist heritage of many other left groups). Having decided on the central importance of re-evaluating theory, this debate was primarily conducted through the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot;.
The &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; was a faultline during unity negotiations between left groups during the Socialist Alliance. It was proposed that the groups within the SA produced a single paper. This would have resulted in the loss of the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot;, something that was contentious within the CPGB, both pro and against. The discussions however became moot after the Socialist Workers Party decided to leave the Socialist Alliance and join the movement that would result in the formation of Respect – The Unity Coalition.

The formation of Respect – The Unity Coalition marked an upswing in the importance of the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot;. The CPGB was initially divided whether to embrace the organisation, the PCC initially sided with the pro-affiliation faction led by Ian Donovan. It however reversed this position early in Respect&#x27;s life to agree retrospectively with the anti-affiliation faction; Red Platform led by Manny Neira. This reversal managed to alienate both factions at different times, resulting initially in Manny Neira breaking away to form the short lived Red Party, followed by Ian Donovan after the change of position. This early debate though settled into a strong editorial line against Respect, for being an &#x27;unprincipled unpopular front&#x27;, which followed through to the split resulting in Respect Renewal and Left List. The paper&#x27;s commitment to angular debate and reporting on the topic, combined with the lack of coverage from more official sources, led to increase in readership. The paper, at the height of the Respect project, reached 40,000 readers a week. This controversy has refreshed the party, seemingly leading to a new wave of confidence and generation of recruits.

The paper offered to become the paper of the Campaign for a Marxist Party. This collapsed after repeated disagreements about Marxist theory and the logistics of running the movement with members of the Democratic Socialist Alliance. The paper has also been at the forefront over debates between the CPGB-PCC and the Alliance for Workers Liberty over Communist policy towards Israel.

In line with Marxist tradition the actual CPGB-PCC contributors write under a variety of assumed names. John Chamberlain usually calls himself &quot;Jack Conrad&quot; or &quot;John Bridge&quot;. This explains the multiplicity of authors but familiar sets of prose. The &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; has been estimated to have as few as 37 members as of 2007 (which is consistent with the £2,250 the party attempts to raise through the paper every month to cover printing costs). This is an increase on the 10 or so who were initially part of &quot;The Leninist&quot;.

John Chamberlain and Mike Macnair are reasonable indicators of the party position, with both sitting on the central committee of the CPGB-PCC, writing leading articles on theory and being the only members to have had books published by the party.

<text>The Porteous Riots surrounded the activities of John Porteous, Captain of the City Guard of Edinburgh, Scotland, who was lynched by a mob for his part in the killing of innocent civilians while ordering the men under his command to quell a disturbance during a public hanging in the Grassmarket, Edinburgh in April 1736. Although the rioters were generally supportive of the convicted smugglers, Porteous seems to have been a somewhat overbearing official, despised by the mob and the underclasses of Edinburgh society.

==Riot==

In April 1736 three convicted smugglers, Andrew Wilson, a &quot;notorious smuggler&quot;, William Hall and George Robertson, had been tried and condemned to death. While Hall&#x27;s sentence was commuted to exile, Wilson and Robertson awaited their fate in the condemned cell at Edinburgh&#x27;s notorious Tolbooth Prison next to St Giles Cathedral. A few days before their execution the pair tried to escape. Wilson removed a bar from the cell window but became stuck &quot;being a very stout man&quot; and blocked Robertson&#x27;s escape.

On 14 April 1736, Andrew Wilson and George Robertson were publicly hanged in the Grassmarket. However, when the body of Wilson was cut down by a sailor, Captain Porteous of the City Guard reacted by grabbing a musket and firing at the sailor. Unfortunately he missed and killed a man standing behind in the crowd. Porteous ordered the City Guards to fire on the enraged crowd, killing a further five people. In the ensuing riot, the hangman, Porteous, and the city guards sought refuge in the City Guardhouse on the Royal Mile where the situation worsened. This prompted the Lord Provost of Edinburgh to instruct Captain Porteous to call out the entire City Guard, furnish them with powder and shot, and ensure the guardhouse was not stormed by the rioters.

Accounts of events that followed are confusing but what is certain is that Captain Porteous initially instructed his troops to fire above the heads of the crowd. However, in so doing, they wounded people in the windows of the surrounding tenement buildings which just made the crowd even more violent. As panic set in, Porteous ordered the City Guard to shoot directly into the mob which led to the deaths of another six people. However, the rioters retreated and the streets quietened.

==Conviction and deferment of execution==
Porteous was arrested the same afternoon and charged with murder. On 5 July 1736, he was tried at the High Court of Justiciary. A majority of witnesses testified that Porteous had personally fired into the crowd on 14 April, although sixteen others said they had not seen him do so. Feelings were running high in Edinburgh when the jury unanimously found Porteous guilty of murder. He was sentenced to death and the execution was set to take place in the Grassmarket on 8 September 1736. Porteous was imprisoned in the same condemned cell in the Tolbooth that had earlier held Wilson and Robertson.

Events in Scotland alarmed the government in London, and Sir Robert Walpole attempted to influence events by asking his representative in Edinburgh to become involved. A formal appeal was petitioned to Queen Caroline, who ordered the execution to be deferred by six weeks, pending the return of the king from Hanover. But Walpole had miscalculated, underestimating the depth of feeling in Scotland.

==Public lynching==

The deferment of the sentence caused public resentment in Edinburgh, with people mistakenly believing that Porteous had been fully reprieved. The city authorities increased the guard at the Tolbooth prison when they learned that there was a plot to lynch the imprisoned Captain. However, the evening before it was due to happen, a mob of more than four thousand gathered at Portsburgh, west of the city. They made their way across the Grassmarket to the Cowgate and up to the High Street before converging on the Tolbooth. Eventually the mob was able to overpower the guards and Porteous was dragged from his cell up the Lawnmarket to the West Bow and down to the Grassmarket. It was there that he was hanged from a dyer&#x27;s pole using a rope taken from a local draper&#x27;s shop.

After a short while Porteus was pulled down and stripped naked. His nightgown and shirt were then wrapped around his head before he was hanged again. However, as his hands were untied, he was able to struggle free. Some of the mob began beating him savagely, breaking his arm and shoulder and an attempt was made to set his naked foot alight. He was hauled up again and hung and died a short while later just before midnight on 7 September 1736. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, the following day.

==Aftermath==

The events in Edinburgh heightened the sense of alarm in London, where the government was concerned about its control of Scotland. Prime Minister Robert Walpole, Queen Caroline and the Secretary of State Duke of Newcastle thought that Porteous had been unnecessarily sacrificed to appease the mob and there were even rumours that the local city magistrates had been involved in the conspiracy.

In February 1737 a parliamentary inquiry was held in the House of Lords, It initially proposed the disbanding of the City Guard and removal of Netherbow Port, but these proposals were subsequently dropped. Eventually, the only punishments enforced were a £2,000 fine imposed on the city (used to support Porteous&#x27; widow) and the disbarment from all offices of the Lord Provost, Alexander Wilson.

It was variously thought that Porteous&#x27; murder was carried out by friends of those who had been shot and killed, revenge by the smugglers, a Jacobite plot, or even a conspiracy by Presbyterian extremists. However, the organisation of events seems to imply a degree of planning, thought to be the work of James Maxwell, an Edinburgh journeyman carpenter, together with a small group of city tradesmen and journeymen.

Despite a reward of £200 being made available by the government for information, those responsible for the murder of Porteous were never found.

==Legacy==

The final resting place of John Porteous in Greyfriars Kirkyard had for more than two hundred years been marked by a small square stone engraved with the single letter &quot;P&quot; and the date 1736. More recently, this has been replaced with a headstone of Craigleith stone, bearing the inscription &quot;John Porteous, a captain of the City Guard of Edinburgh, murdered September 7, 1736. All Passion Spent, 1973.&quot;

The spot where Porteous died in the Grassmarket is today marked by a memorial plate. The site of the notorious Tolbooth prison is marked by paving stones arranged in the form of a heart, known as the Heart of Midlothian. Even today, passers-by will spit on the spot, a tradition originally intended to demonstrate their contempt for the hated Tolbooth.

A fictionalised account of the lynching forms part of the early chapters of the novel &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot; by Sir Walter Scott (1818).

<text>In computer science, message queues and mailboxes are software-engineering components typically used for inter-process communication (IPC), or for inter-thread communication within the same process. They use a queue for messaging – the passing of control or of content. Group communication systems provide similar kinds of functionality.

The message queue paradigm is a sibling of the publisher/subscriber pattern, and is typically one part of a larger message-oriented middleware system. Most messaging systems support both the publisher/subscriber and message queue models in their API, e.g. Java Message Service (JMS).

Competing Consumers pattern enables multiple concurrent consumers to process messages on the same message queue. 

==Remit and ownership==
Message queues implement an asynchronous communication pattern between two or more processes/threads whereby the sending and receiving party do not need to interact with the message queue at the same time. Messages placed onto the queue are stored until the recipient retrieves them. Message queues have implicit or explicit limits on the size of data that may be transmitted in a single message and the number of messages that may remain outstanding on the queue.

===Remit===
Many implementations of message queues function internally within an operating system or within an application. Such queues exist for the purposes of that system only.

Other implementations allow the passing of messages between different computer systems, potentially connecting multiple applications and multiple operating systems. These message queuing systems typically provide resilience functionality to ensure that messages do not get &quot;lost&quot; in the event of a system failure. Examples of commercial implementations of this kind of message queuing software (also known as message-oriented middleware) include IBM MQ (formerly MQ Series) and Oracle Advanced Queuing (AQ). There is a Java standard called Java Message Service, which has several proprietary and free software implementations.

Real-time operating systems (RTOSes) such as VxWorks and QNX encourage the use of message queuing as the primary inter-process or inter-thread communication mechanism. This can result in integration between message passing and CPU scheduling. Early examples of commercial RTOSes that encouraged a message-queue basis to inter-thread communication also include VRTX and pSOS+, both of which date to the early 1980s. The Erlang programming language uses &quot;processes&quot; to provide concurrency; these processes communicate asynchronously using message queuing.

===Ownership===
The message queue software can be either proprietary, open source or a mix of both. It is then run either on premise in private servers or on external cloud servers (message queuing service).

* Proprietary options have the longest history, and include products from the inception of message queuing, such as IBM MQ, and those tied to specific operating systems, such as Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ). Cloud service providers also provide their proprietary solutions such as Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), StormMQ, Solace, and IBM MQ.
* Open source choices of messaging middleware systems includes Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Kafka, Apache Qpid, Apache RocketMQ, Enduro/X, JBoss Messaging, JORAM, RabbitMQ, Sun Open Message Queue, and Tarantool.

Examples on hardware-based messaging middleware vendors are Solace, Apigee, and IBM MQ.

==Usage==
In a typical message-queueing implementation, a system administrator installs and configures message-queueing software (a queue manager or broker), and defines a named message queue. Or they register with a message queuing service.

An application then registers a software routine that &quot;listens&quot; for messages placed onto the queue.

Second and subsequent applications may connect to the queue and transfer a message onto it.

The queue-manager software stores the messages until a receiving application connects and then calls the registered software routine. The receiving application then processes the message in an appropriate manner.

There are often numerous options as to the exact semantics of message passing, including:

* Durability – messages may be kept in memory, written to disk, or even committed to a DBMS if the need for reliability indicates a more resource-intensive solution.
* Security policies – which applications should have access to these messages?
* Message purging policies – queues or messages may have a &quot;time to live&quot;.
* Message filtering – some systems support filtering data so that a subscriber may only see messages matching some pre-specified criteria of interest.
* Delivery policies – do we need to guarantee that a message is delivered at least once, or no more than once?
* Routing policies – in a system with many queue servers, what servers should receive a message or a queue&#x27;s messages?
* Batching policies – should messages be delivered immediately? Or should the system wait a bit and try to deliver many messages at once?
* Queuing criteria – when should a message be considered &quot;enqueued&quot;? When one queue has it? Or when it has been forwarded to at least one remote queue? Or to all queues?
* Receipt notification – A publisher may need to know when some or all subscribers have received a message.

These are all considerations that can have substantial effects on transaction semantics, system reliability, and system efficiency.

==Standards and protocols==
Historically, message queuing has used proprietary, closed protocols, restricting the ability for different operating systems or programming languages to interact in a heterogeneous set of environments.

An early attempt to make message queuing more ubiquitous was Sun Microsystems&#x27; JMS specification, which provided a Java-only abstraction of a client API. This allowed Java developers to switch between providers of message queuing in a fashion similar to that of developers using SQL databases. In practice, given the diversity of message queuing techniques and scenarios, this wasn&#x27;t always as practical as it could be.

Three standards have emerged which are used in open source message queue implementations:
#Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) – feature-rich message queue protocol, approved as ISO/IEC 19464 since April 2014
#Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) – simple, text-oriented message protocol
#MQTT (formerly MQ Telemetry Transport) – lightweight message queue protocol especially for embedded devices

These protocols are at different stages of standardization and adoption. The first two operate at the same level as HTTP, MQTT at the level of TCP/IP.

Some proprietary implementations also use HTTP to provide message queuing by some implementations, such as Amazon&#x27;s SQS. This is because it is always possible to layer asynchronous behaviour (which is what is required for message queuing) over a synchronous protocol using request-response semantics. However, such implementations are constrained by the underlying protocol in this case and may not be able to offer the full fidelity or set of options required in message passing above.

==Synchronous vs. asynchronous==
Many of the more widely known communications protocols in use operate synchronously. The HTTP protocol – used in the World Wide Web and in web services – offers an obvious example where a user sends a request for a web page and then waits for a reply.

However, scenarios exist in which synchronous behaviour is not appropriate. For example, AJAX ( JavaScript and XML) can be used to asynchronously send text, JSON or XML messages to update part of a web page with more relevant information. Google uses this approach for their Google Suggest, a search feature which sends the user&#x27;s partially typed queries to Google&#x27;s servers and returns a list of possible full queries the user might be interested in the process of typing. This list is asynchronously updated as the user types.

Other asynchronous examples exist in event notification systems and publish/subscribe systems.
* An application may need to notify another that an event has occurred, but does not need to wait for a response.
* In publish/subscribe systems, an application &quot;publishes&quot; information for any number of clients to read.
In both of the above examples it would not make sense for the sender of the information to have to wait if, for example, one of the recipients had crashed.

Applications need not be exclusively synchronous or asynchronous. An interactive application may need to respond to certain parts of a request immediately (such as telling a customer that a sales request has been accepted, and handling the promise to draw on inventory), but may queue other parts (such as completing calculation of billing, forwarding data to the central accounting system, and calling on all sorts of other services) to be done some time later.

In all these sorts of situations, having a subsystem which performs message-queuing (or alternatively, a broadcast messaging system) can help improve the behavior of the overall system.

==Implementation in UNIX==
There are two common message queue implementations in UNIX. One is part of the SYS V API, the other one is part of POSIX.

===SYS V===
UNIX SYS V implements message passing by keeping an array of linked lists as message queues. Each message queue is identified by its index in the array, and has a unique descriptor. A given index can have multiple possible descriptors. UNIX gives standard functions to access the message passing feature.

;codice_1: This system call takes a key as an argument and returns a descriptor of the queue with the matching key if it exists. If it does not exist, and the codice_2 flag is set, it makes a new message queue with the given key and returns its descriptor.
;codice_3: Used to receive a message from a given queue descriptor. The caller process must have read permissions for the queue. It is of two types.
:*Blocking receive puts the child to sleep if it cannot find a requested message type. It sleeps until another message is posted in the queue, and then wakes up to check again.
:*Non-blocking receive returns immediately to the caller, mentioning that it failed.
;codice_4: Used to change message queue parameters like the owner. Most importantly, it is used to delete the message queue by passing the codice_5 flag. A message queue can be deleted only by its creator, owner, or the superuser.

===POSIX===
The POSIX.1-2001 message queue API is the later of the two UNIX message queue APIs. It is distinct from the SYS V API, but provides similar function. The unix man page codice_6 provides an overview of POSIX message queues.

==Graphical user interfaces==
Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) employ a message queue, also called an &quot;event queue&quot; or &quot;input queue&quot;, to pass graphical input actions, such as mouse clicks, keyboard events, or other user inputs, to the application program. The windowing system places messages indicating user or other events, such as timer ticks or messages sent by other threads, into the message queue. The GUI application removes these events one at a time by calling a routine called codice_7 or similar in an event loop, and then calling the appropriate application routine to process that event.

<doc id="429710" wikidata="Q1379348" url="?curid=429710" title="Oldsmobile Cutlass">
<text>The Oldsmobile Cutlass was a series of automobiles produced by General Motors&#x27; Oldsmobile division between 1961 and 1999. At its introduction, the Cutlass was Oldsmobile&#x27;s entry-level model; it began as a unibody compact car, but saw its greatest success as a body-on-frame intermediate. The Cutlass was named after Vought F7U Cutlass, as well as the type of sword, which was common during the Age of Sail.

Introduced as the top trim level in Oldsmobile&#x27;s compact F-85 Series, the Cutlass evolved into a distinct series of its own, spawning numerous variants. These included the 4-4-2 muscle car in 1964, the upscale Cutlass Supreme in 1966, the high-performance Hurst/Olds in 1968, and the Vista Cruiser station wagon.

By the 1980s, Oldsmobile was using the Cutlass as a sub-marque, with numerous vehicle lines bearing the name simultaneously. The compact Cutlass Calais, midsize Cutlass Ciera, Cutlass Cruiser station wagon, and flagship midsize Cutlass Supreme were among the models available during this time.

In the 1990s, Oldsmobile began moving away from its traditional model lines, with other legacy vehicle nameplates like the 98 and 88 being discontinued in 1996 and 1999, respectively. The Cutlass name was likewise retired in 1999 in favor of the all-new Oldsmobile Alero, ending nearly 40 years of continuous Cutlass production. 


==Origins==

Oldsmobile first used the Cutlass name on an experimental sports coupe designed in 1954. It rode a wheelbase, and featured a dramatic boat-tailed fastback roofline and stock V8. Its platform was similar to the compact F-85 introduced seven years later.

For model years 1939 and 1940, Oldsmobile introduced the Oldsmobile Series 60 and Oldsmobile Series 70 which shared the GM A platform and GM B platform with Chevrolet and Pontiac models. The Series 60 was discontinued in 1948, while the Series 70 was cancelled in 1950. The division then offered multiple models using the Oldsmobile Series 80 and Oldsmobile Series 90 platforms during the 1950s. When the division decided to revisit offering a smaller platform again, they didn&#x27;t return to the traditional naming convention of reintroducing the Series 70 and instead offered the new compact as the F-85 Series, inspired by the North American F-86 Sabre fighter jet, and beginning a new tradition of using fighter jet names for their products as the Jet Age began, and using nameplates as series designations, and was a revival of a naming convention the company offered from 1928 to 1938 called the F-Series. Oldsmobile management decided to continue to take advantage of the &quot;rocket&quot; marketing strategy started with the Rocket V8 engine. The United States Air Force did previously produce a research fighter jet called the McDonnell XF-85 Goblin but it wasn&#x27;t placed into production. During World War II, many GM factories temporarily suspended automobile production and manufactured fighter aircraft, bombers and aircraft engines for the war effort, and emphasizing their contribution was reflected in the division&#x27;s decision to name their products after fighter aircraft. Starting in 1929, GM did own Allison Engine Company which manufactured aircraft engines for the United States Military until 1992 when the Allison Division was sold.
== First generation (1961)==

General Motors began developing its first compact cars in 1956, beginning with initial planning on what would become the Chevrolet Corvair in 1960 on the GM Z platform. The following year a second series of somewhat longer cars was planned for Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac; what would be termed &quot;senior compacts&quot; on the &quot;Y&quot; platform. They would share the same body shell and lightweight engine. Oldsmobile designer Irv Rybicki began work on the Olds model in 1957. It finally went on sale in 1960 as a 1961 model.

The Oldsmobile F-85 shared the new &quot;Y-body&quot; platform with the Buick Special and Pontiac Tempest, using a 112-inch (2845 mm) wheelbase and still-novel unibody construction. It was Oldsmobile&#x27;s smallest, budget priced model—some two feet (60 cm) shorter and $451 ($ in dollars ) less than the next-smallest Olds, the full-sized Dynamic 88. The F-85 had double wishbone front suspension and a four-link live axle in the rear, suspended with coil springs all around; the drum brakes had a diameter of . Standard engine was the new &quot;Rockette&quot; all-aluminum V8, Oldsmobile&#x27;s version of the Buick aluminum V8, which later became the Rover V8. With a two-barrel carburetor and an 8.75:1 compression ratio, it was rated at 4,800 rpm and at 3,200 rpm. Specifications for the base engine remained the same throughout the 1961–1963 production run.

===1961===

The first-year F-85 was offered in two body styles, a four-door sedan or a four-door station wagon with either two or three seats, and in a choice of two trim levels, base or De Luxe. Transmission options were initially a 3-speed manual (with synchromesh on the top two gears) and the newly introduced 3-speed Roto Hydramatic. Overall length was , and curb weight was around . A few months after the model introduction, Oldsmobile added a &quot;power pack option&quot;, which included a four-barrel carbureted, high-compression (10.25:1), dual exhaust version of the 215 cu in aluminum V8, and a shorter 3.36:1 final drive ratio with either manual and automatic transmissions. This premium fuel-only engine was rated at at 4,800 rpm and at 3,200 rpm. Initial sales were somewhat disappointing, but were soon picked up by the May 1961 introduction of a pair of pillared two-door coupes, each with a different roofline and market placement: the F-85 Club Coupe, which became the lowest-priced Oldsmobile model, and the sporty F-85 Cutlass. The Cutlass came equipped with the 185 hp &quot;power pack&quot; drivetrain, and featured De Luxe-type exterior trim with a more upscale interior with standard bucket seats, upholstered in two-tone vertically pleated vinyl, and an optional center console. 80,347 F-85s were built in total for the 1961 model year.

&quot;Car Life&quot; magazine tested an F-85 with the standard engine and automatic transmission, and recorded a 0–60 (0–96 km/h) time of 14.5 seconds, with a top speed just over . They praised its construction, but found its steering too slow and its suspension too soft for enthusiastic driving.
===1962===
For 1962 styling changes were minor, and included a new grille, different chrome ornamentation on the bodysides and new interior trim. The existing F-85 models returned, and a convertible was added to the lineup in September, available in both standard and Cutlass versions. An all-synchromesh four-speed manual became optional. Overall F-85 sales rose to 97,382, with the Cutlass displacing the four-door De Luxe sedan as the top-selling model.
====The Oldsmobile Jetfire====
The Oldsmobile Jetfire was a Cutlass pillarless hardtop with a turbocharged version of the 215 V8, which Oldsmobile referred to as the &quot;Turbo-Rocket&quot;. This made the 1962 Jetfire the first ever turbocharged production car. Equipped with a Garrett AiResearch turbocharger and carburetor, the Turbo-Rocket engine was rated at at 4,600 rpm and at 3,200 rpm.
The Jetfire came with bucket seats and console, unique trim—two chrome fins on the hood and full-length contrast stripes on the bodysides—and a pressure/vacuum gauge mounted in the console (where it was almost hidden). Although much faster than a standard F-85, the Jetfire was criticized for having the same soft suspension as its less-powerful brothers, for its lack of a tachometer and other instruments, and for the poor shift quality of both the automatic transmission and the optional four-speed. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; tested an automatic Jetfire and obtained a 0–60 time of 9.2 seconds, with a top speed of 110 mph (176 km/h). The Jetfire&#x27;s high cost (nearly $300 over a standard Cutlass hardtop) and reliability problems with its turbocharged engines limited sales to 3,765.
Ultimately the Jetfire engine was far ahead of its time. With forced induction and an already high compression ratio, the Jetfire was capable of producing more torque than a naturally aspirated engine that was twice its size, significantly improving the engine&#x27;s efficiency and usability in real-life driving conditions, turbo lag not being an issue at motorway speeds. But since turbo and supercharging the engine essentially means forcing the compression in the combustion chamber even higher, the Jetfire was prone to &#x27;spark-knock&#x27; and without modern engine management systems, the only way to mitigate this was to use a 50/50 mixture of methanol and distilled water.
===1963===
The F-85 was restyled for the 1963 model year, to a crisper, more squared off design than the one of the 1961–62 models. While the wheelbase was unchanged at 112 inches, the new sheetmetal added to the F-85&#x27;s rear overhang, increasing overall length to . The Jetfire and its turbocharged V8 returned, for what would be its final year. Three-row seating was dropped on station wagons. On automatic transmission models only, the compression ratio of the &quot;Cutlass&quot; engine was raised to 10.75:1, pushing output to at 4800 rpm and at 3200 rpm. A Delcotron alternator became standard on all models, as well as on the rest of the Oldsmobile car line. Overall sales climbed again to 121,639, of which 53,492 were Cutlasses.

When the decision was made to upgrade the F-85, Jetfire and Cutlass to the all-new GM A platform, the GM Y platform was repurposed for the Chevrolet Corvette in 1976.
==Second generation (1964)==

Disappointing sales of the compact F-85, along with the introduction of Ford Motor Company&#x27;s intermediate Fairlane in 1962, prompted GM to enlarge the senior compacts for the 1964 model year.

===1964===

The new intermediate F-85 now rode a conventional body-on-frame chassis with a perimeter frame which it shared with the newly introduced &quot;A-body&quot; Chevrolet Chevelle, and upgraded Buick Special and Pontiac Tempest. Wheelbase grew to , overall length to , and weight by more than . Both the aluminum V8 and the Roto Hydramatic were discontinued in favor of a new cast-iron small-block V8 of displacement and an optional two-speed Jetaway automatic transmission with variable-pitch stator. Buick&#x27;s V6 was the standard engine. It was the first time that Oldsmobile used a six-cylinder engine since the Oldsmobile Seventy Six was discontinued in 1950 while it was sourced from a different GM Division.

The body styles of the previous model returned, and a new Vista Cruiser, a stretched-wheelbase () version of the standard station wagon featuring a raised rear roof with tinted skylights and a fold-down, forward-facing third seat, debuted on February 4, 1964. The 4-4-2 model, derived from the BO-9 police package, was also introduced in March 1964 (costing $285.14 in 1964), as an answer to the new intermediate muscle car market created by the Pontiac GTO that same year.

Sales increased to 167,002 for 1964, not counting Vista Cruisers.

===1965===

For 1965 a modest facelift increased overall length to while the front end received a &quot;dumbbell-style&quot; grille similar to full-sized Olds models. A bigger 400 cu in (6.6 L) engine was included with the 4-4-2 option, based on the newly introduced 425 cu in (6.9 L) engine from the full-sized Oldsmobiles while the Buick 225 V6 and Olds 330 Jetfire Rocket V8 were carried over from the previous year, with increased power ratings for the V8 options. Sales increased again to 187,097. The year 1965 was the first for Oldsmobile&#x27;s &quot;Rocket&quot; logo that would last, with minor variations, until the 1990s.
===1966===

The 1966 models were slightly restyled again, with body lines similar to the full-sized 88, and semi-fastback rooflines with extended sail panels and tunneled rear windows on Sport (pillared) and Holiday (hardtop) coupes. The Buick V6 was replaced on base models by an Oldsmobile-badged &quot;Action-Line 6&quot; version of Chevrolet&#x27;s &quot;Turbo-Thrift&quot; straight-6 engine, while the Jetfire Rocket V8 continued with power ratings of . New that year was the Cutlass Supreme four-door hardtop sedan also dubbed the Holiday Sedan by Oldsmobile, the first such body style for Olds&#x27; intermediate line.
===1967===
Changes for 1967 included the availability of optional disc brakes and the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic to supplement the two-speed Jetaway. A new option was the Turnpike Cruiser package on Cutlass Supreme coupes and convertibles, which used a two-barrel carburetor and mild camshaft with the 400 cu in (6.6 L) engine and a (numerically) low axle ratio for efficient and relatively economical freeway cruising. The Turnpike Cruiser used the heavy-duty suspension of the 4-4-2, and was available only with a Turbo-Hydramatic. The term &quot;Turnpike Cruiser&quot; was a naming conflict due to the 1957–1958 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser.

==Third generation (1968)==
===1968===

The F-85/Cutlass underwent a major body restyle in 1968, as did all other GM A-body cars. Oldsmobile&#x27;s was penned by the styling studio headed by Stan Wilen. Two-door and four-door models now rode different wheelbases: for two-doors and for four-doors. Ostensibly, this change was to allow more individual styling, although several engineers were quoted off the record as saying the wheelbase had created problems with uncomfortable &quot;freeway hop&quot; owing to its resonance frequency. Overall length shrunk about , but curb weight rose approximately to for the hardtop coupe. Two-door F-85 and Cutlass models adopted a semi-fastback roofline, which was a revival of a streamlining on all GM products from 1942 until 1950 as demonstrated on the Oldsmobile Rocket 88 Club Coupe.

Base model remained the F-85, with mid-level Cutlass S, and upscale Cutlass Supreme, as well as the 4-4-2, which became a distinct model instead of an option package. A limited-production model was the Hurst/Olds, a special 4-4-2 marketed by Oldsmobile and Hurst Performance. The H/O combined the 4-4-2 suspension package with a Rocket V8, not ordinarily offered in Cutlasses because of a GM policy limiting intermediates to engines of or less. Cutlass and Vista Cruiser station wagons were likewise redesigned; the F-85 wagon was discontinued.

Engine options were similar to the previous year, although the Cutlass&#x27;s V8 option was expanded to , still with both two- and four-barrel carburetion. The variable-pitch stator feature of both optional two-speed Jetaway and three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmissions was discontinued.

===1969===
The 1969 F-85/Cutlass models received only minor trim changes from their &#x27;68 counterparts such as a now-Olds trademark split grille with vertical bars and vertical taillights. Per federal safety regulations, headrests were now standard equipment and the ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column to lock the steering wheel when not in use, in common with all other 1969-model GM cars, one year before the locking steering columns were federally mandated.

Engine offerings were unchanged from 1968, but a new three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 transmission was added to the option list and available with all versions of the Rocket V8, including the standard two-barrel version, four-barrel &quot;Ultra High Compression&quot; option and the W-31 option, conservatively rated at . The two-speed Jetaway automatic was still available with the Chevy-built &quot;Action-Line&quot; six or the two-barrel V8. The Turnpike Cruiser two-barrel Rocket V8 was dropped and the four-barrel 400 engine from the 4-4-2 was available only in the Vista Cruiser wagons.

===1970===
The 1970 F-85 and Cutlass was available in seven body styles, three of which were coupes: a pillared fastback Sports Coupe (in F-85, Cutlass S or 4-4-2 trims), an hardtop fastback Holiday Coupe (Cutlass S and 4-4-2 only), and finally a more formal notchback Holiday Coupe, only offered in Cutlass Supreme trim. This practice was similar to that followed at the time by Ford and Mercury for their intermediates, which were offered in both notchback and fastback coupes starting in 1968. Also available were a four-door hardtop Holiday Sedan, a four-door Town Sedan, a convertible, a flat-top station wagon called the Cutlass Cruiser, as well as the fancier Vista-Cruiser station wagon. Counting all trim level and body style permutations, Oldsmobile&#x27;s 1970 lineup included 15 different intermediate models.

With GM tossing out the 400 cubic-inch limit for intermediates and the 4-4-2 now coming standard with the larger 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 from the big Oldsmobiles and previously used in the 1968–69 Hurst/Olds, Olds discontinued the 400 engine entirely and also offered the 455 as an option in the Cutlass S models and the Vista Cruiser wagons. There was an SX option that became available in 1970 and was available only on the Cutlass Supreme hardtop and convertible. The SX cars all had the 455 engine and TH-400 automatic transmission.

The same assortment of three- and four-speed manual transmissions were carried over from previous years with Hurst shifters used on floor-mounted three-speeds and all four-speeds. The two-speed Jetaway automatic transmission was discontinued entirely with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic now the sole offering for shiftless driving. Cutlass S coupes with the optional Strato bucket seats and Turbo Hydra-matic could be equipped with the Hurst Dual-Gate shifter (also known as the &quot;His and Her-Shifter&quot;) in conjunction with the extra-cost center console. The Hurst Dual-Gate made it possible to either put the transmission in Drive, and let the transmission decide when to shift. Or it could be placed in a manual mode, much like today&#x27;s computer-controlled automatics.
A 1970-only offering was the Oldsmobile Rallye 350, a value-priced high-performance model using the 350 engine. It was intended for younger buyers that wanted the performance and looks of a supercar, but might have trouble with the rising insurance premiums associated with 455-engined cars like the 4-4-2. In essence the Rallye 350 was an appearance package (coded &quot;W45&quot;) tied to mandatory options, and could be ordered on the Cutlass S Holiday or Sports Coupe as well as on the F-85 Sports Coupe. All Rallye 350s were painted in Sebring Yellow with matching urethane-coated bumpers front and rear. The package also included special black and orange decals, blacked out grille and yellow-painted 7&quot; wide Super Stock II rally wheels without trim rings, wearing G70×14&quot; bias-belted Wide Oval blackwall tires. The engine was the &quot;L74&quot; air-inducted high-compression 350 cu.in. Rocket V8 engine, fitted with a Quadrajet carburetor and producing . Required options were the associated &quot;Force-Air&quot; fiberglass vented hood, dual exhaust with 4-4-2-style megaphone outlets, 3.23:1 axle ratio, heavy-duty &quot;Rallye-Sport Suspension&quot; with front and rear stabilizers, sports mirrors and sports steering wheel.

===1971===

The 1971 model shared much of the same exterior sheetmetal as the 1970, but with a new hood, grille, and headlight assemblies, as well as new bumpers and taillights. Four new exterior body colors were offered, Viking Blue, Lime Green, Bittersweet, and Saturn Gold.

The famous &quot;Rocket&quot; V8 continued in several different sizes and power options, with both the large 455 and &#x27;small-block&#x27; 350 available with either 2- or 4-barrel carburetors. This was the last year for the 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine, as it had not been a popular offering in Olds intermediates. All engines were now fitted with hardened valve seats, preparing for the upcoming mandate for unleaded gasoline that took effect with the introduction of catalytic converters on 1975 models. The 1971 Olds engines also featured lowered compression ratios and designed to run on regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded gasoline with a research octane rating of 91 or higher (equivalent to 87 octane by today&#x27;s octane measurements).

===1972===

For 1972, there were minor style changes to the Cutlass, and the 4-4-2 reverted to being a Cutlass trim line (W-29 option) instead of the distinct model it was in 1971.

The primary changes to the 1972 Cutlass were the front grilles and the tail lights. The straight six engine was dropped but would return to the lineup in 1975.

The Hurst/Olds used the Cutlass Supreme notchback hardtop and convertible bodies. A 1972 Hurst/Olds paced the Indianapolis 500, and Olds built about 630 replicas, some 25% of them convertibles.

The entry-level F-85 series was reduced to solely a four-door sedan, then discontinued mid-year due to low sales. This ended the use of the F-85 nameplate, although it would later resurface in 1975 on an entry-level version of the compact Omega.

==Fourth generation (1973)==


===1973===

The Cutlass line was redesigned for 1973 using GM&#x27;s new &quot;Colonnade&quot; A-body platform. The model lineup consisted of the base Cutlass, Cutlass &quot;S&quot;, Cutlass Supreme, Cutlass Salon, Vista Cruiser station wagon, and the 4-4-2 appearance package on the Cutlass &quot;S&quot; colonnade coupe. While rooflines were shared with other GM divisions, the Cutlass bodies had two Oldsmobile-specific convex creases—one starting behind the front wheel and running rearward into the door and curving upward at its trailing end, and the other curving down just ahead of the rear wheel and continued by the crease line of the quarter panel behind the rear wheel. The Cutlass &quot;S&quot; and 4-4-2 offered optional &quot;Strato&quot; bucket seats with high seatbacks and built-in head restraints; these seats could be swiveled 90 degrees to permit easier entry and exit for the driver and front passenger.

The new Salon package was offered first as a 4-door Colonnade sedan, which was joined in 1974 by a 2-door hardtop coupe. It was an upscale &quot;European&quot; style luxury/sports package, similar in concept to the Pontiac Grand Am, and was the first Oldsmobile with the international-flags emblem. The Salon included items such as upgraded suspension, radial tires, reclining bucket seats and a hand-operated headlamp dimmer switch built into the turn signal switch.

All Cutlass models came standard with front disc brakes The standard engine was a 350 Rocket V8 (K VIN engine code), a 350 Rocket V8 with dual exhaust (M code), a 455 Rocket V8 (U code, or L75), and a 455 V8, with a hotter cam and W30-style heads. This engine was called the L77 (V code), and was used primarily in four-speed cars and automatics without air conditioning in the Hurst/Olds. Transmissions included a standard column-shift three-speed manual, optional four-speed Muncie M20 manual with Hurst shifter, and three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic. Upgraded gauges were optional.

===1974===
Changes for 1974 included new taillight lenses and radiator grilles, and a new front fascia with bumper-mounted turn signals used only on the base model. There were newly mandated rear bumpers, with a new hydraulic energy absorpotion system. Both the 350 and 455 Rocket V8s were carried over unchanged from 1973 aside from revisions required to meet 1974 emissions regulations. The Turbo Hydramatic transmission became standard equipment on all Cutlass models.

===1975===

For 1975, Oldsmobile added two smaller engines to attract economy-minded buyers in the aftermath of the 1973–74 energy crisis. These were the Chevrolet-built inline six (previously offered from 1966 to 1971) and a new 260 V8 based on the Olds 350 Rocket V8, which continued as an option. Also continuing was the 455 Rocket V8, rated at . All engines had catalytic converters and required unleaded gasoline in the United States; Canadian buyers could opt to delete the converter. The three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment in conjunction with the six-cylinder engine on all Cutlass models except Salons and station wagons. However, only 0.2% of Cutlasses were built with a manual transmission as most buyers wanted the 350 V8 and Turbo Hydramatic as in previous years.

The 1975 grilles were somewhat more angular and separated into eight pieces on each side. The front turn signals were now incorporated into the grille. At the rear, new two-piece taillights were divided vertically. The S and Supreme both had a chrome strip atop the hood, while the Supreme also had the Oldsmobile logo mounted atop the grille. A fuel economy gauge was optional.

The Cutlass line overtook the full-size Delta 88 as the best-selling Oldsmobile line in 1975, with the Cutlass Supreme coupe accounting for the majority of those sales, surpassing the Chevrolet Chevelle and Ford Torino to become the best-selling intermediate-sized car in America. The Cutlass was also the second-best selling car line in the U.S. in 1975, with only the full-sized Chevrolet Impala/Caprice ahead of it.

===1976===
The Cutlass became America&#x27;s best selling car this year and would hold this title for most years into the 1980s. A restyled front end with waterfall-type split grilles and new rectangular headlights was introduced that would become an Olds Cutlass trademark in coming years, lasting into the late 1980s. Coupe bodies were reshaped for a smoother, less contoured look than the 1973–75 design, a design change shared with Buick&#x27;s A-body coupes. Cutlass sedans and wagons kept their bulges through the end of model year 1977. Taillights were revised and the license plate/fuel filler was moved above the bumper. The base Cutlass line was dropped, with the Cutlass S nameplate now applied to the entry-level coupe and sedan this year – both of which featured an aerodynamic slanted front nose in contrast to the upright front ends of other Cutlass models including the Cutlass Supreme coupe, sedan and wagon, Vista Cruiser wagon, Cutlass Salon coupe and sedan, and the new Cutlass Supreme Brougham coupe. The 4-4-2 option was still offered on Cutlass S coupes as an appearance/handling package.

Engine offerings were carried over from 1975 including the Chevy-built 250 cubic-inch inline six and Olds-built Rocket V8s of 260, 350 or 455 cubic inches. A three-speed manual transmission was standard with the six-cylinder engine but Turbo Hydra-matic was optional with this engine and the 260, and required with the 350 and 455 V8s. A new option this year was the T-50 Borg-Warner five-speed manual transmission, which was available only with the 260 V8.

===1977===
New grilles highlighted all 1977 Cutlass models with Cutlass S sedans and coupes reverting to an upright grille/front end while the more aerodynamic slanted front end was only offered with the 4-4-2 option. &quot;Oldsmobile&quot; nameplates in a new sans-serif typeface replaced the former script ones.

Inside was a slightly revised instrument panel with the clock relocated to the right side of the dash above the glovebox. This also marked the introduction of Oldsmobile&#x27;s new mechanical digital clock. The Chevrolet inline six was replaced by Buick&#x27;s 231 V6 (standard on all models except Salon and Vista Cruiser), while the 260 and 350 Rocket V8s were carried over. The big-block 455 Rocket V8 was discontinued and replaced by a new small-block 403 cubic inch Rocket V8. Transmissions included a three-speed manual (standard and only available with the V6 engine), five-speed manual (coupes with 260 V8 only) or three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic – optional on V6 models, included with the 260 V8 in sedans and 350 and 403 V8s on all models, and standard on station wagons. A sedan was added to the Supreme Brougham line, while the Salon lost its sedan version.

632,742 Cutlasses were built in 1977, the highest production for the model.

==Fifth generation (1978)==


===1978===
The 1978 Cutlass was downsized to the new version of GM&#x27;s A-body with a shorter, wheelbase. This Cutlass was lighter than earlier versions at around , and it could be ordered with any of several engines built by GM&#x27;s different divisions; a Buick 231 V6, Oldsmobile 260 V8, Pontiac 301 V8 or Chevrolet 305 V8s with either two- or four-barrel carburetors. This generation could still be ordered with the T-50 Borg-Warner five-speed manual transmission for several model years.

The &#x27;78 Cutlass lineup included the fastback design &quot;aeroback&quot; Salon and Salon Brougham fastback coupes and sedans, and the formal roof Supreme, Supreme Brougham and Calais coupes. The fastbacks were twins to the Buick Century of the same sales years. The Salons quickly proved to be far less popular than the notchback Supreme and Calais coupes. There were also &quot;two-seat&quot; (6 passengers in two rows) Cutlass Cruiser and Cutlass Cruiser Brougham station wagons; both being smaller, more conventional replacements of the three-seat (8 passenger) Vista Cruiser.

Broughams featured softer, quieter rides, and fancier trim and upholstery. A factory T-top was optional on notchback coupes only. The 4-4-2 appearance and handling package, available on Salon coupes, featured large lower body stripes and 4-4-2 decals outside but not always shown with decals, unique 4-4-2 seats and badges inside, and a taut performance suspension featuring quicker-ratio steering, heavier springs, stiffer shocks, a stiffer front stabilizer bar, a rear stabilizer bar, and bigger tires. The Cutlass Calais used essentially the same suspension as the 4-4-2, but it also came standard with several other performance and touring options, including full instrumentation, an aluminum spoked sport steering wheel, reclining front bucket seats and a center console with floor shifter.

Cosmetically, the 1978 line continued through 1979 with only slight changes front and rear. A bewildering array of grilles were used on the different equipment levels for 1978 and 1979, including two sets each of slotted (Salon), waterfall (Supreme and Brougham), and eggcrate (Calais) style designs.

===1979===

The same model lineup continued, with a revision of both the front grille and taillight lenses. A diesel version of the Oldsmobile 260 (based on the Olds 350 diesel) was optional; diesel Cutlasses had the &quot;Oldsmobile Diesel&quot; badges on the decklids, where gasoline-powered Cutlasses had the &quot;Rocket&quot; logo.

Only 2499 Cutlass Calais coupes were equipped with the Hurst/Olds W-30 package, featuring unique aluminum wheels trimmed with gold paint, an exclusive console-mounted Hurst Dual Gate floor shifter, special gold over black or white two-tone paint and an otherwise unavailable Oldsmobile 350 V8 with a four-barrel carb and dual outlet exhausts. It is estimated that only 537 cars with the H/O package had T-Tops.

===1980===
Cutlass Supreme and Calais coupes received new header panels incorporating four headlights, mimicking the 1977 model. The four-door Salon was dropped due to poor sales. Taking its place was a conventional notchback sedan known simply as &quot;Cutlass&quot;, with base, LS, and Brougham trim levels available. Sister division Buick did the same with their Buick Century sedan (the 1978 to 1980 Centuries shared the bodyshell with the Cutlass Salon). The 4-4-2 package was moved to the Cutlass Calais, and while it lacked the Dual Gate shifter, it was essentially a carryover of the 1979 Hurst/Olds, even having the Oldsmobile 350 V8. 886 442&#x27;s were produced for 1980. The 260 diesel engine was dropped, as it was considerably slower yet no more economic than the 5.7-litre diesel.
===1981===

The fastback Salon coupe was dropped, and the Supreme and Calais got a restyle that included a more aerodynamic nose and smoother body lines. Sedans got quad headlamps and a new grille. The 4-4-2 was dropped. Most of this range continued to be marketed as the Cutlass Supreme until 1986, although the Cutlass Cruiser was replaced for 1984.
==Cutlass family (1982)==
In 1982, Oldsmobile began using the Cutlass nameplate as a sub-marque, with numerous distinct vehicle lines bearing the name simultaneously.

===Cutlass Ciera===

The more space-efficient Cutlass Ciera was introduced on GM&#x27;s new front-wheel drive mid-sized A platform in 1982. The Cutlass Cruiser station wagon nameplate followed the Ciera to its new platform in 1984. Coupes were produced until 1992, sedans and wagons until 1996. For the final year in production, this model was renamed simply Oldsmobile Ciera.

During its run, the Cutlass Ciera was consistently Oldsmobile&#x27;s best-selling model.
===Cutlass Supreme===
====1980–1988====

Meanwhile, the previous-generation Cutlass Supreme continued on the (now renamed) rear-wheel-drive G-body platform for six more years. The Hurst/Olds edition reappeared for two years in 1983 and 1984. From 1985 through 1987 the 4-4-2 replaced the Hurst/Olds as the high performance model.

Until 1984, the deluxe Cutlass Supreme model was known as the Cutlass Calais. When the Calais nameplate moved to its own platform in 1985, the top Supreme was renamed to Cutlass Salon. As the new front-wheel drive Cutlass Supreme model was being launched in 1988, the rear-drive G-special coupe remained in production for one final model year as the Cutlass Supreme Classic.
====1988–1997====
The premium Cutlass Supreme nameplate was moved to the new front-wheel-drive mid-sized GM W platform in 1988. Originally a coupe, a 4-door sedan model was added in 1990. Convertibles were also produced from 1990 to 1995.

In 1998, the Cutlass Supreme was replaced by the Oldsmobile Intrigue.
===Cutlass Calais===

The third Cutlass nameplate introduced was the compact Cutlass Calais (originally just Oldsmobile Calais) on the front-wheel-drive N-body in 1985. The famed 4-4-2 nameplate was revived for the Cutlass Calais in 1990 and 1991.

The Cutlass Calais was replaced by the Oldsmobile Achieva in 1992.
==Sixth generation (1997)==

The Oldsmobile Cutlass name was revived for the 1997 model year as a slightly upscale version of the mechanically identical fifth generation Chevrolet Malibu. The Cutlass did have a few minor differences. Visually, it had a split grille front fascia like other Oldsmobiles at the time and all red rear tail lamps. Mechanically, the 3.1-liter V6 engine was the only engine offered. The Cutlass was available in GL and GLS trim. Available options on the base GL model included power windows, power driver&#x27;s seat, power mirrors, CD player, and alloy wheels. The GLS included most of the GL&#x27;s options as standard equipment plus added leather interior and was available with a power astroroof. This generation of Cutlass was intended as a placeholder model to fill the gap left by the discontinuation of the Ciera, before the all-new Alero arrived. Production of this generation of Cutlass ended July 2, 1999, making it the final vehicle to bear the Cutlass name. This generation of Cutlass was built exclusively at the Oklahoma City Assembly 
plant in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. This generation of Cutlass was not offered in Canada.

<text>A pedicure is a cosmetic treatment of the feet and toenails, analogous to a manicure. 

During a pedicure, dead skin cells are rubbed off the bottom of the feet using a rough stone (often a pumice stone). Skincare is often provided up to the knee, including granular exfoliation, moisturizing, and massage.

The word &quot;pedicure&quot; is derived from the Latin words &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;of the foot&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;care&quot;.

==History==

People have been pedicuring their nails for more than 4,000 years. In southern Babylonia, noblemen used solid gold tools to give themselves manicures and pedicures. The use of nail polish can be traced back even further. Originating in China in 3000 BC, nail colour indicated one&#x27;s social status, according to a Ming Dynasty manuscript; royal fingernails were painted black and red. Ancient Egyptians have been manicuring since 2300 BC.

A depiction of early manicures and pedicures was found on a carving from a pharaoh&#x27;s tomb, and the Egyptians were known for paying special attention to their feet and legs. The Egyptians also colored their nails, using red to show the highest social class. It is said that Cleopatra&#x27;s nails were painted a deep red, whereas Queen Nefertiti went with a flashier ruby shade. In ancient Egypt and Rome, military commanders also painted their nails to match their lips before they went off to battle.

==Pedicures in the United States==
Pedicures generally take approximately 45 minutes to an hour in the US. According to the US Department of Labor, manicure and pedicure specialists earned a median income of around $20,820 in 2015. Most professionals earn an hourly wage or salary which can be augmented through customer tips. Independent nail technicians depend on repeat and consistent business to earn a living. The most successful independent manicure technicians may earn salaries of over $50,000 per year. Nail technicians can earn up to $100 per hour from performing more technical nail treatments, such as a French pedicure and sculpting, although these treatments are not popular for the feet. A standard pedicure treatment usually costs around $40.

==Types of pedicures==
There are various different types of pedicures. Some of the most common types are as follows (names and products may vary from spa to spa):

*Regular pedicure: A simple treatment that includes foot soaking, foot scrubbing with a pumice stone or foot file, nail clipping, nail shaping, foot and calf massage, moisturizer and nail polishing.
*Shanghai pedicure: A traditional foot medicine deriving from Chinese medicine that involves soaking feet in hot water and using a scalpel.
*Spa pedicure: Includes the regular pedicure and generally adds one of the following- Paraffin dip, masks, mud or seaweed treatment.
*Dry or Waterless pedicure: A pedicure typically including nail shaping, cuticle cleanup, callus smoothing, moisturizer with massage, nail polish or buffing, but definitively without soaking the feet in water. Often the callus smoothing, nail shaping, and cuticle cleaning are all performed with an electric file.
*Paraffin pedicure: A treatment that includes a regular pedicure but also includes the use of paraffin wax. The feet are covered with layers of paraffin wax to moisturize feet.
*Stone pedicure: Basically a foot massage that involves the use of different essential oils that are rubbed with the help of hot stones for the massage of the feet and legs.
*French pedicure: A regular pedicure that involves the use of white polish on the nail tips with a sheer pink color on the base.
*Mini pedicure: This focuses mainly on the toes with a quick soak, nail shaping and polish, but does not include the massage or sole care. This is designed for an appointment between regular pedicures for generally well maintained feet.
*Athletic pedicure: Similar to a regular pedicure for both the genders. It includes either a clear polish or toenail buffing. Usually, the aromatics used will be more cooling, such as peppermint, cucumber, or eucalyptus.
*Chocolate pedicure: A pedicure which may include a chocolate foot soak, chocolate foot mask, or chocolate moisturizing lotion.
*Ice Cream pedicure: A pedicure where a &quot;bath ball&quot;, which looks like a scoop of ice cream, is chosen. The soak is followed with a foot scrub (usually vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry) and topped with a whipped moisturizing lotion. Red nail polish simulates the ice cream&#x27;s &quot;cherry&quot;.
*Margarita pedicure: A regular pedicure which includes a salt scrub, soaking water with fresh limes, a lime-based massage oil, and moisturizer.
*Champagne or Wine pedicure: This is a regular pedicure usually featuring a grape-seed scrub, grape mask peel, and finished off with a grape seed oil or moisturizing massage.

==Risks==
Improper or unsanitary pedicures can increase the risk of infection. First, some pedicure practices can damage the skin if performed too aggressively and thus increase infection risk. For example, using a pumice stone to shave off calluses on the sole of the foot can result in abrasions and cuticle nippers may accidentally remove too much of the cuticle. Second, instruments or foot baths may not be properly sterilized, introducing pathogens into already vulnerable skin. &quot;Mycobacterium fortuitum&quot; is known to cause infection in foot spas. These risks are particularly high for people with medical conditions that affect blood flow, sensation, immune response, or healing in the feet, such as diabetes. Major health organizations such as the CDC recommend that diabetics do not soak their feet or remove calluses, and often have a podiatrist cut their toenails, which are some of the key parts of many pedicures.

Solutions and chemicals used to cleanse or soak feet can also cause skin irritation. There can be a risk of developing an ingrown toenail from improper trimming.

<doc id="429716" wikidata="Q410826" url="?curid=429716" title="U.S. Route 95">
<text>U.S. Route 95 (US 95) is a major north–south United States Highway in the western United States. It travels through the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, and Idaho, staying inland from the Pacific Coast. US 95 begins in San Luis, Arizona, at the Mexican border, where Calle 1—a short spur—leads to Highway 2 in San Luis Río Colorado, Sonora. Its northern terminus is at the Canadian border in Eastport, Idaho, where the roadway continues north as British Columbia Highway 95.

Unlike many other US Highways, it has not seen deletion or replacement on most of its length by an encroaching Interstate Highway corridor, due to its mostly rural and mountainous course. Because of this, it still travels from border to border and is a primary north–south highway in both Nevada and Idaho. This is one of the few US Routes to cross from Mexico to Canada.

==Route description==
===Arizona===
US 95 begins in the United States at the San Luis Port of Entry, which connects it with Mexico. It then follows the Colorado River northward to San Luis and on to Yuma, where it goes through town and crosses I-8. As it leaves Yuma, US 95 is an undivided two-lane highway that passes through the U.S. Army&#x27;s Yuma Proving Ground.
It then travels northward between the proving ground to the west and the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge to the east until Quartzsite. Here, it merges with I-10 and runs concurrent, heading westward for until the Colorado River, where it enters California, just shy of Blythe.

US 95 spends in Arizona.

===California===

US 95 enters California at Blythe along its dual segment/concurrency with I-10. It travels largely parallel to the west bank of the Colorado River until it joins I-40 in Needles. The route then travels north from Goffs to the Nevada state line.

The total distance in California is about .

===Nevada===

US 95 in Nevada is a divided highway between Cal-Nev-Ari (the SR 163 junction to Laughlin) and Boulder City. It is the longest highway in Nevada, at nearly . It joins at the interchange as a multi-lane divided freeway past SR 173 and as part of the concurrent route of I-11 and US 93 in Boulder City. It crosses I-15 at the Spaghetti Bowl, where US 93 becomes concurrent with I-15. US 95 continues as a freeway until again becoming a divided highway at Corn Creek Road, where I-11 temporarily ends, northwest of the Las Vegas Valley.

Shortly after entering Nye County, US 95 becomes an undivided two-lane highway past the Mercury interchange, as it meanders northwestward through the state, roughly paralleling the California state line. Along this route, it runs through the Amargosa Valley, serving Beatty before heading north into Goldfield and Tonopah. The highway is concurrent with US 6 for several miles north of Tonopah, before it then heads north towards Hawthorne, Schurz (where it meets US 95 ALT, which heads northwest toward Yerington, Carson City—via US 50 west—Reno—via Ramsey Weeks Cutoff, US 50 east, SR 439 north, and I-80 west—and Fernley) and Fallon. North of Fallon, it meets and runs concurrently with I-80 for , from Exit 83 west of Lovelock to Exit 176 at Winnemucca. It then heads north to the border with Oregon at McDermitt, a distance of .

===Oregon===

In Oregon, US 95 is an undivided two-lane highway in the sparsely-populated high desert in the southeastern corner of the state, running completely in rural Malheur County. From the Nevada state line at McDermitt, the highway heads north and gradually climbs to its crest at Blue Mountain Pass, at an elevation of above sea level. US 95 descends to Basque Station and Burns Junction at , then eastward down to Rome () and up to Jordan Valley (). The highway heads north-northeastward to the Idaho state line, entering southwest of Marsing in Owyhee County. The speed limit on US 95 in Oregon was until March 2016, when it was raised to to match the speed limits set by Nevada and Idaho.
US 95 is designated the I.O.N. Highway No. 456 (see Oregon highways and routes); &quot;I.O.N.&quot; stands for Idaho–Oregon–Nevada. This section of highway is a primary commercial route between Boise and northern California, connecting to I-80 at Winnemucca, Nevada. US 95 crosses into the Mountain Time Zone approximately north of Nevada.


===Idaho===
US 95 is an undivided two-lane highway during most of its length in Idaho, which is over .

US 95 enters Idaho from Oregon in Owyhee County, about southwest of Boise. It passes through Homedale and crosses the Snake River before a junction with concurrent US 20 and US 26, which run together for . As it proceeds north, US 95 crosses I-84 and US 30 before going through the Payette National Forest. Immediately after Riggins, the highway re-enters the Pacific Time Zone as it crosses the Salmon River. US 95 follows the descending river, then climbs over White Bird Hill to the Camas Prairie, then descends the Lapwai Canyon to the Clearwater River. In August 2015, milepost 420 was replaced with one reading 419.9 to prevent the sign from being stolen by marijuana enthusiasts.

US 95 becomes a four-lane divided highway after crossing the river east of Lewiston; it runs concurrent with US 12 for several miles. The highways split as US 12 continues west to Lewiston, and US 95 turns northwest and climbs a steep grade up to the rolling Palouse. At a junction with US 195, US 95 proceeds north to Moscow as a recently completed divided highway. It becomes an undivided highway in Moscow and continues north to Coeur d&#x27;Alene, crossing I-90. US 95 goes north to Sandpoint, where it joins with US 2, after which the highways run concurrent until after Bonners Ferry, where US 2 heads east to Montana, and US 95 continues north to Canada, meeting BC 95 at the Canadian border, at the Eastport-Kingsgate Border Crossing.

==History==

US 95 was one of the original U.S. highways proposed in the 1925 Bureau of Public Roads numbering plan. Under the original proposal, the highway would only exist in Idaho, from Payette to the Canada–US border north of Eastport. When the plan was adopted by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials on November 11, 1926, the route of US 95 had been approved south to Weiser, still existing solely in Idaho. A proposal to extend US 95 south to Winnemucca, Nevada, was considered by AASHO in 1937; however, action was deferred due to sections in Oregon that were incomplete. AASHTO reconsidered the idea at its meeting on June 28, 1939, as part of a larger plan to extend the highway south to Blythe, California. This plan was adopted at that meeting and became effective on January 1, 1940. On June 27, 1960, US 95 was extended further south into Arizona, through Yuma to the Mexican border in San Luis, which still serves as the southern terminus of US 95.

===Washington (former)===
North of Lewiston, Idaho, US 95 entered Washington for , partially concurrent with U.S. Route 195. The route was moved to a new four-lane divided highway that bypassed Washington in October 1977. The section was replaced by an extension of US 195 and a spur route created in 1979.

===Idaho===

In April 2005, the Idaho legislature approved a bill to widen the entire highway from two lanes to four lanes for the entire route starting at the US-Canada port of entry in Eastport, and ending at the border with Oregon in remote Owyhee County. The contract for the project was awarded to Washington Group International and CH2M Hill. The contract is worth more than $1.2 billion, and is slated to last for more than six years, cover 13 major reconstruction projects, affecting over of the highway&#x27;s nearly in the state.

The major factors in the reconstruction are due to the fact that US 95 is the only route that runs from north to south in western Idaho, starting at Eastport in the north and ending in remote Owyhee County; as well as safety concerns because there have been numerous accidents and fatalities on the narrow and very dangerous curves. This change started with the reconstruction and improvements made to White Bird Hill. Major projects have been undertaken including on the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Indian Reservation.

The first stage was completed in August 2005 from just south of Coeur d&#x27;Alene to Fighting Creek Road, and is an upgraded four-lane highway for approximately . The second stage, from Fighting Creek Road to Lake Creek on the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Indian Reservation, was completed in late July-early August 2006 and upgraded a stretch of the highway. The third stage, from Lake Creek to Worley, started mid-to-late 2006 and was completed in 2008. This section is significant, as it is on the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Indian Reservation. The &quot;new&quot; highway bypasses the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Casino, the largest business on the reservation, with the old highway becoming an alternate route that will connect the highway to the casino and the more remote regions of the reservation. This project improved a stretch of highway and shortened the length of the highway by about .

Also, a nearly stretch was completed in 2007 from just north of Lewiston to south of Moscow.

==Future==

===Nevada===

US 95 is part of a proposed northwestward extension of Interstate 11 (I-11) from Las Vegas. The interstate highway would primarily follow the US 95 corridor through central and northwestern Nevada, extending to I-80 near Reno and Sparks via Tonopah. In 2018, the Nevada Department of Transportation had initiated public outreach regarding its long-range planning efforts to narrow down options for the future I-11 corridor.

<text>Virginia Water is a commuter village in the Borough of Runnymede in northern Surrey, England. It is home to the Wentworth Estate and the Wentworth Club. The area has much woodland and occupies a large minority of the Runnymede district. Its name is shared with the lake on its western boundary within Windsor Great Park. Virginia Water has excellent transport links with London–Trumps Green and Thorpe Green touch the M3, Thorpe touches the M25, and Heathrow Airport is northeast.

Many of the detached houses are on the Wentworth Estate, the home of the Wentworth Club which has four golf courses. The Ryder Cup was first played there. It is also home to the headquarters of the PGA European Tour, the professional golf tour. One of the houses featured in a headline in 1998—General Augusto Pinochet was placed under house arrest having unsuccessfully resisted extradition, the facing of a criminal trial in Chile.

In 2011 approximately half of the homes of the postcode district, which is narrower than the current electoral ward, were detached houses. In 2015 Land Registry sales data recorded Virginia Water&#x27;s single postcode district as the most expensive as to the value of homes nationwide.

==Etymology==
The village is named after the nearby artificial Virginia Water Lake, which forms part of Windsor Great Park.

==History==
The Devil&#x27;s Highway Roman Road, running from London, through Staines-upon-Thames (previously Pontes) to Silchester is thought to run through Virginia Water. Some of the local course has been lost, disappearing at the bottom of Prune Hill, and reappearing at the Leptis Magna ruins in the Great Park.

Nicholas Fuentes has argued that defeat of Boudica&#x27;s insurrection by the Romans in AD 60/61 took place at Virginia Water, with the landscape between Callow Hill and Knowle Hill matching the battle landscape described by Tacitus, and the battle commencing roughly where the railway station lies.

The area was for centuries similar to the Strode or (also written) Stroude tything, one of four divisions of the very large &quot;ancient&quot; parish of Egham. &quot;Egham&quot; the Domesday survey valued at £40 per annum. Egham was in the original endowment of Chertsey Abbey in 666–75. The manor was included in all subsequent confirmations of the abbey land, and was held until the surrender of the abbey in 1537, since which time all its vestigial rights remained with the Crown, which thus sold much land piecemeal and controlled who could build major developments for centuries.

Christ Church, in the Church of England was completed in 1838 and established as a parish the same year.

The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s brother-in-law lived at the &#x27;Wentworths&#x27; house; this building now forms the Wentworth Club. In 1850, the house was bought by Ramón Cabrera, 1st Duke of Maestrazgo, an exiled Carlist general. During the Second World War, plans were put into place to move the government to the house, with tunnels dug underneath what is now the club carpark.

To the east of the lake is the Clockcase tower, a Grade I listed, triangular belvedere built in the Great Park during 1750s. It is three-storey Gothic style construction. George III made it into an observatory and Queen Victoria occasionally had tea there. The building is inaccessible to the public, lying within a private part of the park. It is still owned by the Royal Estate and when listed in 1984 used as a residence.

===Virginia Park===

Virginia Park is a gated housing development occupying the site of the former Holloway Sanatorium, a mental asylum constructed in 1885 to the design of William Henry Crossland. This was a private institution where patients paid for their own treatment. In 1948, it was taken over by the newly established National Health Service, and closed in 1980.

After years of neglect, in 2000 the building and grounds were converted into private sector housing by a developer, Octagon. Octagon produced 23 residences in the main building and built 190 new houses and apartments on the grounds. Properties are expensive and typically reach beyond the £1 million mark.

The main building is Grade I listed, the highest category of recognition and protection. The sanatorium chapel is Grade II* listed, meaning in a constrained mid-tier of the statutory scheme. The gated estate includes a spa, gymnasium, multi-purpose sports hall, and all-weather tennis court.

===Wentworth Estate===
 of Virginia Water is owned by a members&#x27; trustee body, known as the Wentworth Estate. Founded in the 1920s, this estate comprises private sector houses, luxury apartments, woodland, several golf courses and a leisure club. It also includes part of the River Bourne, Chertsey.

The estate, due to its high walls and electric gates, has been compared to a &quot;fortified suburb&quot; found more commonly in South Africa and a place &quot;where money disappears from view&quot;. Famous residents have included Elton John, Bruce Forsyth, Diana Dors and various professional golfers. Properties on the estate are regarded as &quot;super prime&quot; and have sold for as much as £50 million.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===
The River Bourne runs from the artificial Virginia Water Lake through the long southern half of Virginia Water.

===Housing and socio-economic geography===
The 2011 census stated that the &quot;Virginia Water&quot; postcode district (post town) had the following dwellings, thus making up the relative proportions shown:

Government data in terms of sales of homes from Autumn 2014 to 2015 showed Virginia Water to be the most expensive post town nationally (i.e. excluding any part of London). The recent averaged sold price for its homes was just over £1.1m.

==Transport==
The village has a junction railway station, built after the first line opened in 1856 to Ascot. Frequent South Western Railway trains run to London Waterloo, Weybridge, Twickenham, Richmond, Staines, Feltham, Clapham Junction, Vauxhall and Reading.

==Education==

Christ Church school was built by the National Society in 1843 on land given by Saint George Francis Caulfeild of &quot;The Wentworths&quot;. He attempted to bind the land with &quot;all buildings thereon erected or to be erected to be forever hereafter appropriated and used as land for a School for the Education of Children and Adults or Children only of labouring manufacturing and other poorer classes&quot;. The school was built for £716. 16 7. In 2020, due to loss of intake, Surrey County Council set underway closure, moving attendees to consolidated Englefield Green Infant School by 2023.

St Ann&#x27;s Heath Junior School is on Sandhills Lane.

Trumps Green Infant School is on Crown Road in the south of the ward and the postcode district (the only of post town in this case).

<text>Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg (; ; 1 March 1868 – 28 June 1914) was the wife of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Their assassination in Sarajevo sparked a series of events that led, four weeks later, to World War I.

== Early life and ancestry ==
Countess Sophie Chotek von Wognin was born in Stuttgart as the fifth child and fourth daughter of Count Bohuslav Chotek von Chotkow und Wognin and his wife, Countess Wilhelmine Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1838–1886). Her father was a Bohemian aristocrat, by birth member of an old House of Chotek, who served as Austrian Ambassador to the royal courts of Stuttgart, Saint Petersburg and Brussels.

As a young woman, Sophie became a lady-in-waiting to Archduchess Isabella, the wife of Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen, head of the Bohemian cadet branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

== Courtship with Franz Ferdinand ==
It is unknown where Sophie first met Archduke Franz Ferdinand, although it may have been at a ball in Prague in 1894. Franz Ferdinand, who was stationed at a military garrison in Prague, paid frequent visits to Halbturn Castle, the home of Archduke Friedrich, and it was assumed that he had fallen in love with Friedrich&#x27;s eldest daughter, Archduchess Marie Christine. The liaison was discovered by Archduchess Isabella, herself only born into a mediatised family (the House of Croÿ). When Isabella discovered Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s locket lying on the tennis court, she opened it, expecting a photo of her daughter. Instead, the locket contained a photo of Sophie. From this, a scandal ensued.

Franz Ferdinand had become heir presumptive to the throne, after the suicide of his cousin Crown Prince Rudolf in 1889 and the death of his father Karl Ludwig of typhoid in 1896. As such his uncle, the Emperor Franz Joseph, informed him that he could not marry Sophie, who could not become an Empress consort. To be an eligible consort for any member of the Imperial House of Habsburg, one needed to belong to one of the reigning or formerly reigning princely dynasties of Europe. Although the Chotek family were noble since at least the 14th century and had been made counts of the Holy Roman Empire in 1745, they were not of dynastic rank (although Sophie was also of royal blood by also being a descendant of the Habsburgs, in particular from Matilda of Habsburg, daughter of King Rudolph I of Germany, who was also Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s ancestor).

Franz Ferdinand refused to renounce Sophie to marry equally and beget an heir to the throne, compounding the scandal surrounding the death and illicit affair of the emperor&#x27;s previous heir.

== Marriage with Franz Ferdinand ==

In 1899, under pressure from family members (especially the Archduchess Maria Theresa, the emperor&#x27;s formidable sister-in-law and Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s stepmother) the couple were granted permission to wed. Franz Ferdinand was allowed to retain his place in the order of succession and a suitable title was promised for his future wife. However, to prevent Franz Ferdinand from attempting to proclaim his wife empress-queen or declaring their future children dynasts and thus eligible to inherit the crown (especially that of Hungary, where morganatic marriages were unknown to law) once he ascended the throne, he was compelled to appear at the Hofburg Imperial Palace before the gathered archdukes, ministers, and dignitaries of the court, the Cardinal-Archbishop of Vienna and the Primate of Hungary on 28 June 1900 to execute by signature an official instrument in which he publicly declared that Sophie would be his morganatic wife, never to bear the titles of empress, queen or archduchess, and acknowledging that their descendants would neither inherit nor be granted dynastic rights or privileges in any of the Habsburg realms.

Sophie and Franz Ferdinand were married on 1 July 1900 at Reichstadt (now Zákupy) in Bohemia. The Emperor did not attend the nuptials, nor did any of the archdukes, including Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s brothers. The only members of the Imperial family who were present were Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s stepmother, Archduchess Maria Theresa, and her two daughters, Maria Annunciata and Elisabeth Amalie.

Upon her marriage, Sophie was given the title &quot;Fürstin von Hohenberg&quot; (&quot;Princess of Hohenberg&quot;) with the style of &quot;Durchlaucht&quot; (&quot;Serene Highness&quot;). In 1909, she was elevated to &quot;Herzogin&quot; (Duchess) and accorded the higher style of &quot;Hoheit&quot; (&quot;Highness&quot;).

Nonetheless, all of the archduchesses, mediatized princesses and countesses of Austria and Hungary took precedence before her. For the fourteen years of their marriage, Sophie never shared her husband&#x27;s rank, title, or precedence. Her position at the Imperial court was humiliating, aggravated by the Imperial &quot;Obersthofmeister&quot;, Alfred, 2nd Prince of Montenuovo, whose insecurity about his own morganatic background is said to have prompted him to rigorously enforce court protocol at Sophie&#x27;s expense. Problems of protocol prevented many royal courts from hosting the couple despite Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s position as heir to the throne. Nonetheless, some did so, including King George V and Queen Mary of the United Kingdom, who warmly welcomed the couple to Windsor Castle from 17 to 21 November 1913. Queen Mary&#x27;s father, Francis, Duke of Teck, was the offspring of a morganatic marriage and was shunned by royal families in Europe.

The couple had four children:
* Princess Sophie of Hohenberg (1901–1990), married Count Friedrich von Nostitz-Rieneck (1891–1973)
* Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg (1902–1962), married Countess Elisabeth von Waldburg zu Wolfegg und Waldsee (1904–1993). His descendants married descendants of the Royal Houses of France and Portugal and Austria (Archduke Joseph Arpad).
* Prince Ernst of Hohenberg (1904–1954), married Marie-Therese Wood (1910–1985)
* stillborn son (1908)

== Assassination ==

In 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was invited by General Oskar Potiorek, Governor of the Austro-Hungarian province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to watch troops on maneuvers for three days in Sarajevo, the provincial capital. Sophie was not usually allowed to accompany her husband on ceremonial visits because of her lower status, but on this occasion, Franz Ferdinand was invited as a military commander rather than a royal personage. The archduke therefore arranged for Sophie to join him on 28 June, the third and final day, for a troop review followed by a visit to the city to dedicate a new museum before returning to Vienna. The date coincided with the 14th anniversary of their Oath of Renunciation and was a rare opportunity to celebrate in public together, although he knew that the visit would be dangerous.

At 10:10 am of Sunday, 28 June 1914, when the procession passed the Sarajevo central police station, Nedeljko Čabrinović hurled a hand grenade at the archduke&#x27;s car. The driver accelerated when he saw the object flying towards the car and the grenade exploded under the wheel of the next car. Two of the occupants, Eric von Merizzi and Count Boos-Waldeck, were seriously wounded. Fourteen spectators were hit by bomb splinters.

After attending the official reception at the City Hall, Franz Ferdinand asked about the members of his party that had been wounded by the bomb. When the archduke was told they were badly injured and had been taken to the hospital, he insisted on being taken to see them. A member of the archduke&#x27;s staff, Andreas, Freiherr von Morsey, suggested this might be dangerous, but General Oskar Potiorek, who was responsible for the safety of the Imperial party, replied, &quot;Do you think Sarajevo is full of assassins?&quot; However, Potiorek did accept it would be better if Sophie remained behind in the city hall. When Freiherr Morsey told Sophie about the revised plans, she refused to stay, arguing: &quot;As long as the Archduke shows himself in public today I will not leave him.&quot;

In order to avoid the city centre, Potiorek decided that the Imperial car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, Potiorek forgot to tell the driver, Leopold Loyka, about this decision. On the way to the hospital, by the Latin Bridge, the driver took a right turn into Franz Joseph Street. One of the conspirators, Gavrilo Princip, was standing on the corner at the time. Oskar Potiorek immediately realized the driver had taken the wrong route and shouted &quot;What is this? This is the wrong way! We&#x27;re supposed to take the Appel Quay!&quot;

The driver put his foot on the brake, and began to back up. In doing so he moved slowly past the waiting Gavrilo Princip. The assassin stepped forward, drew his pistol, and at a distance of about five feet, fired twice into the car. Franz Ferdinand was hit in the neck and Sophie in the abdomen. Sophie said to her husband, &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, what has happened to you?!&quot; She then fell bleeding. Before losing consciousness he pleaded, &quot;Sopherl! Sopherl! Don&#x27;t die! Stay alive for our children!&quot;, using his pet name for the duchess. They were both dead within an hour.

The assassination triggered the July Crisis which led to the First World War.

== Funeral and burial ==
The bodies were transported to Trieste by the battleship and then to Vienna by special train for a joint funeral mass in a short ceremony at the Hofburg Palace attended by the immediate imperial family. The Archduke and Duchess were then taken to be entombed side by side as he had requested in the crypt of Artstetten Castle, the Habsburgs&#x27; summer home, because burial in the Imperial Crypt was forbidden to Sophie. Today the castle houses a museum in their memory.

===Commemorative coin===

Duchess Sophie&#x27;s castle of Artstetten was selected as a main motif for the 10-euro Castle of Artstetten commemorative coin minted on 13 October 2004. The reverse of the coin shows the entrance to the Hohenberg family crypt, with left-set overlay profile portraits of Sophie and Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

<text>The Beta Band are a Scottish musical group formed in 1996. Their style is described as being a blend of folk, psychedelia, electronica, post-rock and trip hop, often involving stylistic experimentation and occasional humour. They were praised by members of both Radiohead and Oasis, the former of which chose them to open for their concerts in 2001.
The band&#x27;s music was featured in &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s All Gone Pete Tong&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
The Beta Band was formed in 1996 by St Andrews musicians Steve Mason (vocals, guitar) and Gordon Anderson. The two had plans to call their group The Pigeons but later changed their minds. As they pulled together songs for their debut EP, &quot;Champion Versions&quot;, they added Robin Jones (drums), John Maclean (DJ, sampler, keyboards), and Steve Duffield (bass). While living in a flat in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush they met Phil Brown, who after hearing their demo took it to Miles Leonard, who promptly signed the band. Duffield quit the band soon after recording &quot;Champion Versions&quot;. Not long after they were signed to Regal/Parlophone, Anderson became ill and quit the band. He later produced recordings under the name Lone Pigeon. The remaining members added Englishman Richard Greentree to play bass and solidified their lineup.

===&quot;The Three E.P.&#x27;s&quot;===
&quot;Champion Versions&quot; was released in July 1997 to critical acclaim not only for the music but also for the record&#x27;s innovative cut-and-paste sleeve design (the work of John Maclean). The trumpet solos recorded for &quot;Dry the Rain&quot; on &quot;Champion Versions&quot; were played by Jonathan Levien, credited as Jon Levien on the record. Jonathan was attending the Royal College of Art in 1997 where he met John Maclean in the Art Bar and mentioned that he could make some interesting whale sounds on his trumpet. Jonathan Levien was invited to Chalk Farm recording studios shortly afterwards where he was asked to play three riffs on his trumpet for Dry the Rain.

Two further EPs followed in 1998 produced by Chris Allison and the band: &quot;The Patty Patty Sound&quot; in March and &quot;Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos&quot; in July. All three EPs received critical praise, and all three appeared on the appropriately titled &quot;The Three E.P.&#x27;s&quot; collection in September 1998. The compilation was rated by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in the &quot;Top 10 Albums of the year&quot;. The song &quot;Dr Baker&quot; featured on the soundtrack of the first series of &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot;.

===&quot;The Beta Band&quot;===
Despite inner conflict, the band commenced work on their first full-length recording after being signed to Regal. The record, titled &quot;The Beta Band&quot;, was released in June 1999. The album was more stylistically diverse than the initial EPs, and was loose and unrefined in comparison to their prior style of production. The mixed press turned decidedly negative when the band announced their own disdain for the record, including Mason who declared that it was &quot;fucking awful&quot;: Regal&#x27;s deadline and tight budgets kept them, they stated, from refining their improvisations into coherent songs, and led to an album that was conceptually incomplete. Also in June that year the band made a four-stop tour in the United States.

The band returned to the studio to record the double A-side single &quot;To You Alone&quot;/&quot;Sequinsizer&quot;, recorded by future The Go! Team producer, Gareth Parton. It was released on 24 January 2000. The single was received favourably and was regarded as a return to form for the band. The &quot;NME&quot; made it their &quot;Single of the Week&quot;, and would later select it as one of the 50 greatest singles of 2000 in their end-of-year awards. &quot;To You Alone&quot; was also included on the soundtrack of the 2000 remake of the television series &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;, released in March.

===&quot;Hot Shots II&quot;===
A hiatus followed, during which Mason released his second King Biscuit Time EP. The band gradually gravitated back into the studio, this time recruiting UK producer Colin Emmanuel, aka C-Swing, to oversee the process. The album, &quot;Hot Shots II&quot;, appeared in mid-2001, and was warmly received by critics and fans. It sacrificed much of the first album&#x27;s experimentation for more boiled-down pop structure and hooks. The band had originally intended to release &quot;Squares&quot; (b/w &quot;Won&quot;), which featured a sample from the Günter Kallmann Choir&#x27;s 1970 version of Wallace Collection&#x27;s &quot;Daydream&quot;, as the lead single. A video had been filmed and promo discs issued, but because another single (&quot;Daydream in Blue&quot; by I Monster) featuring a sample from the same Günter Kallmann Choir recording was to be released at around the same time, the band opted to release &quot;Broke&quot; instead. A performance on Top Of The Pops for &quot;Broke&quot; had been recorded, but was dropped and has never been shown.

Two other singles were released from the album: &quot;Human Being&quot; in October 2001 and &quot;Squares&quot; in February 2002 (with the I Monster track long out of the charts). The band embarked on a long tour to support the album, at one point supporting Radiohead. In August 2002, they made Number 3 on &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die&quot;.

===&quot;Heroes to Zeros&quot; and split===
The band began demo sessions for their third album in September 2002. They entered the studio with producer Tom Rothrock in 2003 and completed a number of tracks; however, neither the band nor Regal&#x27;s executives were pleased with the results. Producer Nigel Godrich was called in to mix the album, which was finally completed in early 2004. Lead single, &quot;Assessment&quot;, was released on 12 April 2004, followed by the album &quot;Heroes to Zeros&quot; on 26 April. One of the tracks, &quot;Liquid Bird&quot; is based on a sample of &quot;Painted Bird&quot; by Siouxsie and the Banshees. A second single, &quot;Out-Side&quot;, followed in July. The band announced their breakup on their website on 2 August 2004, citing financial discord with their label, to whom they owed £1.2 million. In November, they performed at the Summer Sundae festival and set out on a farewell tour. Their final show was at Edinburgh&#x27;s Liquid Rooms venue on 5 December 2004.

On 3 October 2005, the band released a 2-disc DVD set, &quot;The Best of The Beta Band - Film&quot;, featuring most of the band&#x27;s videos and a selection of short films, television footage, documentaries as well as four songs recorded live at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire on 29 November 2004, one of the band&#x27;s final performances. Also released on the same day was a two CD set, &quot;The Best of The Beta Band - Music&quot;, comprising a compilation disc of studio recordings and a disc containing the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush gig.

Since the split, Steve Mason has released music with his solo project King Biscuit Time, as well as new projects Black Affair and Good Face. In May 2010, he released the first record in his own name entitled &quot;Boys Outside&quot;. Robin Jones and John Maclean have become The Aliens along with former Beta Band member Gordon Anderson (a.k.a. Lone Pigeon) and Richard Greentree is working with his new band The General and Duchess Collins.

On 29 September 2017, Because Music agreed to acquire the Beta Band&#x27;s back catalogue from Warner Music Group, along with two EP&#x27;s by Mason&#x27;s King Biscuit Time project. The reissue campaign launched throughout late 2018.

===Recent activity===
In February 2025, The Beta Band refreshed their social media presence, posting a link to a brand new mailing list stating that they&#x27;ll &#x27;be in touch&#x27;. A few days later, a video entitled &quot;A Bent Bed Hat&quot; was posted, hinting at possible reactivity.

<doc id="429739" wikidata="Q1673431" url="?curid=429739" title="Isaac Mizrahi">
<text>Isaac Mizrahi (born October 14, 1961) is an American fashion designer, actor, singer, television presenter and chief designer of the Isaac Mizrahi brand for Xcel Brands. Based in New York City, he is best known for his eponymous fashion lines. Mizrahi was previously a judge on &quot;Project Runway All Stars&quot;. In 2022 he played Amos Hart in the long-running Broadway revival of Chicago.

==Early life==
Mizrahi was born in Brooklyn, the son of Sarah and Zeke Mizrahi, who was a children&#x27;s clothing manufacturer. He is of Syrian-Jewish descent. His maternal grandparents were Jews from Aleppo, Syria. He grew up as the youngest boy of his family in Midwood, Brooklyn. He bought his first sewing machine at the age of ten with money he had saved from babysitting that summer. At 15, he launched his own label, &quot;IS New York&quot;, with the help of a family friend. He attended Yeshivah of Flatbush, Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts, and the Parsons School of Design at The New School.

==Fashion career==

Mizrahi presented his first collection in 1987 at a trunk show held by New York department store Bergdorf Goodman. The line immediately earned praise from fashion editors, prompting several top retailers to place orders. In 1989, he discussed his designs in an interview with Elizabeth Cannon. He described them as &quot;controlled and glamorous&quot;, &quot;elegant&quot;, &quot;distilled, refined&quot;, inspired by decadence, and by the diversity of New York City. He also expressed his interest in appealing to a refined and exclusive clientele. In 1992, the French fashion house Chanel bought a stake in the company and began to bankroll its operations. Despite continued critical acclaim, sales were inconsistent; Bloomingdale&#x27;s executive Kal Ruttenstein stated that Mizrahi had &quot;good years and bad years.&quot; This volatility is mainly attributed to the designer&#x27;s failure to establish a defined aesthetic or &quot;Mizrahi look&quot;, as the frenetic designer was famed for changing gears each season. Though the company grossed $10–20 million a year, it never made a profit, and lost substantial amounts in its final four years of operation. Chanel eventually tired of the mounting losses and pulled financing in October 1998, forcing the closure of the company after the Fall 1998 collection. Among Mizrahi&#x27;s fans and clients were Hollywood stars Nicole Kidman, Selma Blair, Julia Roberts, Sarah Jessica Parker, Debra Messing and Natalie Portman.

From 1995 to 1997, Mizrahi also designed a diffusion line, named &quot;IS**C&quot; in an act of &quot;name effacement&quot; intended to prevent dilution of the designer&#x27;s full name. This lower-priced line (in the $275 to $850 range) was meant to diversify the label from the very expensive Isaac Mizrahi collection, but it failed to gain traction and was shuttered in 1997.

In 1996 Mizrahi collaborated with Louis Vuitton creating the 100th anniversary two way clear bag.

Mizrahi returned to fashion in 2002 when he began designing another diffusion collection, Isaac Mizrahi for Target. The line was an enormous hit, and soon spread to cover accessories, bedding, housewares, and pet products. Sales volume tripled over five years to over $300 million and introduced the designer to mainstream America. The line was discontinued in 2008 as Mizrahi left for Liz Claiborne.

Mizrahi designed for Claiborne for only one year, 2009. Although advertising campaigns for his Claiborne work—featuring Mizrahi and women of all sizes, races, and ages—were found in major fashion magazines, the line was a disaster almost from launch. The clothes and accessories were very difficult to find, as only a few minor department stores, which were not found in major cities, carried Claiborne clothes. Gottschalks carried only a few pieces before declaring bankruptcy and liquidating, only weeks after Mizrahi&#x27;s launch. Furthermore, the few Liz Claiborne outlets that existed were also far from major cities and were found at outlet malls that were too remote for most customers to visit. As a result, in December 2009, the Liz Claiborne website was closed and rumors abounded that the company was bankrupt and in serious debt. As of fall 2010, Liz Claiborne clothes were sold at J.C. Penney and were not designed by Mizrahi.

In 2010, Mizrahi launched a label called IsaacMizrahiLIVE! exclusively on QVC.

In 2011, Mizrahi sold his brand to Xcel Brands, Inc. In addition to continuing the IsaacMizrahiLIVE! business on QVC, Xcel Brands launched various categories under the Isaac Mizrahi New York, Isaac Mizrahi Jeans, and Isaac Mizrahi brands. As of August 2012, footwear and denim have launched in Bloomingdale&#x27;s and Nordstrom, and Mizrahi&#x27;s first-ever fragrance, Fabulous, was set to debut September 6 on QVC, and in Bloomingdale&#x27;s in October. Mizrahi remained a shareholder, creative director, and media personality for his namesake brand under Xcel.

==Media==
Mizrahi has made appearances in numerous television shows and movies since the 1990s. Including the 1993 Michael J. Fox comedy, &quot;For Love or Money&quot;, as an up-and-coming fashion designer, Julian Russell. In 1995, a movie was released about the development of his Fall 1994 collection called &quot;Unzipped&quot;. In Fall 2005, the &quot;Isaac&quot; show debuted on Style Network. He previously had a show on the Oxygen network.

Mizrahi appears on many of E!&#x27;s programs and has become well known for being flamboyant. He also appeared as himself in the episode &quot;Plus One is the Loneliest Number&quot; of the fifth season of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, and in an episode of &quot;Spin City&quot;. He guest starred on the American dramedy series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, in which he played a reporter for the cable channel Fashion TV in the episode &quot;Lose the Boss&quot;. He appeared as himself in &quot;The Apprentice&quot; season 1 (episode 6) as one of the celebrities supporting an auction for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. He also appeared on the public radio game show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; in 2006, saying, &quot;Fat is the new black&quot;. He also appeared in a Season 4 episode of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;.

Mizrahi has stated that he sees himself as an entertainer who can sing and act. On his Oxygen show, he sang jazz in a nightclub. He has also acted in films, appearing in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; and &quot;Celebrity&quot;.

Mizrahi was a contestant in the &quot;Jeopardy! Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational&quot;. While initially finishing second in a quarter-final game to Jane Curtin, as the highest scoring non-qualifier, he replaced semi-finalist Andy Richter, who had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. He eventually lost to Michael McKean.

In 2006, Mizrahi designed pro bono the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery&#x27;s conservators&#x27; denim work aprons.

In 2009, Mizrahi began co-hosting the first season of &quot;The Fashion Show&quot; on Bravo with singer Kelly Rowland. Bravo launched the series to replace its former hit &quot;Project Runway&quot;, which then moved to the Lifetime network. Mizrahi returned as co-host in November 2010 for the show&#x27;s second season, opposite a close friend and colleague, supermodel Iman, who previously hosted the Canadian version of &quot;Project Runway&quot;. A representative of the network indicated that Bravo believed Mizrahi&#x27;s exciting presenting style would work well with newcomer Iman and the credibility that she brought as a genuine pioneer in the fashion world.

In 2012, Mizrahi participated in the debut season of &quot;Project Runway: All Stars&quot; as a head judge, alongside Marchesa designer Georgina Chapman, which aired on the Lifetime TV Network.

In February 2012, Mizrahi served as red carpet correspondent for &quot;Live with Kelly&quot; during the 84th Annual Academy Awards. The segment included interviews with Brad Pitt, Emma Stone, Rooney Mara, and Gwyneth Paltrow. It aired the morning after the Oscars, during a special episode of &quot;Live with Kelly&quot;.

In 2013, Mizrahi played himself in the final season of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Big C&quot;.

== Controversy ==
In 2006 Mizrahi was the center of a scandal when he groped actress Scarlett Johansson&#x27;s breast while conducting an interview for E! at the Golden Globes. In a 2013 &quot;George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight&quot; interview, Mizrahi attempted to minimize the incident, stating: &quot;This wasn&#x27;t nasty ... This was like, &#x27;Are you wearing a bra? Are you wearing an underwire bra?&#x27; And she was like, &#x27;Oh well.&#x27; &quot;

==Costume design==
Mizrahi has worked as the costume designer for three Broadway revivals, including two plays (&quot;The Women&quot; (2001) and &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (2006)), and one operetta (&quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; (2006)).

For his work on &quot;The Women&quot;, Mizrahi won the 2002 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design.

Mizrahi was the costume designer for the Metropolitan Opera production of &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; (2008), directed by Mark Morris. Mizrahi has been a longtime collaborator with Morris in a partnership dating from 1997, when Mizrahi created costumes for a Morris film project with Yo-Yo Ma, &quot;Falling Down Stairs&quot;, from Ma&#x27;s &quot;Inspired By Bach&quot; series.

<doc id="429741" wikidata="Q7896318" url="?curid=429741" title="University of South Carolina Beaufort">
<text>The University of South Carolina Beaufort (USCB or USC Beaufort) is a public college with three campuses in the Lowcountry region of South Carolina. It is part of the University of South Carolina System, enrolls about 2,000 students, and offers over 50 areas of study. The main campus is in Bluffton. The institution&#x27;s campus in Beaufort houses the school&#x27;s honor programs and the Department of Visual Arts &amp; Design. The campus location on Hilton Head Island is home to the institution&#x27;s program for hospitality management.

==History==
In 1795, a preparatory school and college in Beaufort was chartered as the Beaufort College to serve the families of local residents. Classes began in 1802, and the college reached a prominent status in the community during the antebellum period. The college was forced to close in 1861 at the beginning of the Civil War and the Beaufort College building, constructed in 1852, was occupied by the Union forces for use as a hospital.

The college building was used by the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau during Reconstruction, and it was an elementary school from 1909 to 1959. In the 1950s, two factors brought about the return of higher education to the Beaufort region. The University of South Carolina sought to expand its reach throughout the state by the establishment of extension campuses and the Beaufort County Higher Education Commission was formed by citizens of Beaufort to bring a campus to the area. A branch campus of the University of South Carolina was established in 1959 at the site of the old Beaufort College, but the official opening was delayed by Hurricane Gracie.

The campus experienced steady growth through the years, and it expanded south along Carteret Street. In 2002, the campus was upgraded from a regional campus to a senior campus offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees. USCB opened a second, campus with housing in Bluffton. In 2004, it also began offering programs for the United States Marine Corps on Parris Island, South Carolina. In 2018, the institution opened its third campus, located on Hilton Head Island, to house the program for hospitality management.

==Academics==
USCB is one of the three senior campuses in the University of South Carolina system. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

USCB offers the region&#x27;s only human services degree as well as more traditional degrees like English, psychology, business, communication studies, and education. The school opened a nursing facility in spring 2009. Human simulators provide nursing students hands-on training opportunities. Another popular program capitalizing on nearby Hilton Head Island resorts is the hospitality management program, which draws international students and provides internships. The biology program allows students to explore and study first-hand the continental-shelf and estuarine environment with concentrations in marine science and in coastal ecology and conservation. It offers the bachelor&#x27;s degree in human services online through Palmetto College.

==Student life==
The institution has 2,023 undergraduate students. The gender makeup of the student body is 69 percent female and 31 percent male. The racial makeup of the student body is 60 percent white, 20 percent African-American, 10 percent Hispanic, and 10 percent other.

===Student organizations===
USCB offers numerous student organizations, including several special interest clubs, religious groups, honor societies, and academic clubs. The largest organization is its Student Government Association, consisting of twelve student senators, a vice president, president, and an executive board.

=== Greek life ===
USCB recognizes five chapters of national fraternities and sororities. The sole fraternity on campus is Kappa Alpha Psi. Sororities include Alpha Kappa Alpha, Zeta Phi Beta, Phi Mu, and Zeta Tau Alpha. Fraternities and sororities are housed within the residential dorms.

===Move to NCAA Division II===
On April 14, 2021, the athletic department announced its intention to pursue an NCAA Division II and join the Peach Belt Conference (PBC) in that division starting in the fall of 2022. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball were added to the scholarship sports as a condition of its NCAA and Peach Belt memberships, and USC Beaufort intended for the teams to start their first season in 2023–24. By July 15, 2022, USCB was already accepted into the Continental Athletic Conference for its first year of provisional membership while still playing a Peach Belt schedule as part of the Sand Sharks&#x27; one-year NAIA-NCAA dual membership, but are eligible for a Peach Belt post season play but ineligible for the NCAA postseason during the three-year transition.

<text>The Folketing (, ; ), also known as the Parliament of Denmark or the Danish Parliament in English, is the unicameral national legislature (parliament) of the Kingdom of Denmark — Denmark proper together with the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Established in 1849, the Folketing was the lower house of the bicameral parliament called the Rigsdag until 1953; the upper house was the Landsting. 

The Folketing meets in Christiansborg Palace, on the islet of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen. It passes all laws, approves the cabinet, and supervises the work of the government. It is also responsible for adopting the state&#x27;s budgets and approving the state&#x27;s accounts. As set out in the Constitution of Denmark, the Folketing shares power with the reigning monarch. But in practice, the monarch&#x27;s role is limited to signing laws passed by the legislature; this must be done within 30 days of adoption.

The Folketing consists of 179 members; including two from Greenland and two from the Faroe Islands. General elections must be held every four years, but it is within the powers of the prime minister to ask the monarch to call for an election before the term has elapsed. On a vote of no confidence, the Folketing may force a single minister or the entire government to resign.

Members are democratically elected by proportional representation: 135 directly in constituencies using the D&#x27;Hondt method, alongside 40 leveling seats. The Danish political system has traditionally generated coalitions. Most post-war governments have been minority coalitions ruling with the support of non-government parties. The first sitting of the house is usually attended by the king.

==History==
From 1849 to 1953 the &quot;Folketing&quot; was one of the two houses in the bicameral parliament known as the &quot;Rigsdag&quot;; the other house was known as &quot;Landstinget&quot;. The difference between the houses was its size, voter representation, and electoral system.

The Folketing was elected by common vote among men and consisted mainly of independent farmers, traders, and merchants as well as the educated classes. From 1866 to 1915 the right to vote for the Landsting was restricted to the wealthiest, and some of its members were appointed by the king; so it predominantly represented the landed gentry and other conservatives. From 1915 both men and women had the right of vote for both houses, and the Landsting was elected by common vote, although indirectly and with a higher age limit than for the Folketing. During the next decades, law-making mainly took place in the Folketing, and the Landsting came to be regarded as a superfluous rubber stamp.
In 1953 a revised constitution was adopted by a referendum. Among the changes was the elimination of the Landsting and the introduction of a unicameral parliament, known only as the Folketing. Christiansborg Palace (also known by its nickname &quot;Borgen&quot;, Danish for &quot;the castle&quot;) has been the domicile of parliament since 1849. The palace is in the heart of Copenhagen.

Gaining representation in parliament normally requires only 2% of the national vote. With such a low election threshold a large number of parties are represented in the chamber, making it all but impossible for one party to win the 90 seats necessary for a majority. No single party has achieved this since 1901. All Danish governments since then have been coalitions or one-party minority governments. The constitution allows a government to take office without getting a vote of confidence and stay in office as long as it does not lose a vote of no confidence. One consequence is that, unlike in most other parliamentary systems, most Danish governments in modern times are not assured that their legislative agendas will pass, forcing them to assemble a majority for each individual piece of legislation.

==Constitutional requirements and electoral system==

;Composition of members
* The Folketing consists of 179 members all elected for a four-year term or until the prime minister (via the King-in-council) calls for elections, whichever comes first. 175 members are elected in Denmark proper, while Greenland and the Faroe Islands each elect two members in separate constituencies.
* The constitution does not mention political parties at all, although the electoral act does, and MPs are almost always elected for a party. The only independent who has been elected in modern times is the comedian Jacob Haugaard, but independents, usually unknown ones, are seen at every election. Requirements for standing as an independent candidate are much more lenient than for a new party (signatures from 150 eligible voters), but independents are only allowed to contest in a single constituency, making it difficult to gain the needed number of votes for a seat.
;Voting system
* The Constitution requires &quot;equal representation of the various opinions of the electorate&quot;, and for regional representation to be secured. The electoral act stipulates the details for this: 135 seats are elected by proportional representation in 10 constituencies, and 40 levelling seats are allotted to make up for the difference between constituency and nationwide vote. The 135 district seats are distributed to the parties by the D&#x27;Hondt method under a party-list system. The 40 levelling seats are allocated to the parties using the largest remainder method, and then distributed across electoral provinces with the Sainte-Laguë method and across constituencies with quotients of 1, 4, 7, and so on. Each party may choose among a number of methods for how the seats won by that party are to be distributed among its candidates, with most choosing to use an open list.
* The overall result is proportional to the number of votes cast for each party; however, in rare cases, the largest parties may gain one or two seats extra from smaller parties.
* The voter may vote for a party list, one of the candidates on a party list, or an independent candidate. Voting for a candidate on a party list also gives a vote to that party.
* Parties (usually district party associations) decide on the nomination of candidates before the election. When an open list is used, candidates are elected according to personal votes (including assigned votes). When a relatively closed list is used, only an extreme number of personal votes can change the rank of the list order.
* Parties must either pass the threshold of 2% of the national vote, or gain a constituency seat to gain any supplemental seats. Though very rare, it is possible for a party to gain a constituency seat without getting 2% of the national vote. There is also an esoteric third rule that allows a party to be represented, if it has enough votes in two of the three electoral provinces that the country is divided into. No party has ever fulfilled this rule without getting 2% of the national vote.
* To stand for election, parties that are not currently represented in Parliament must collect signatures of support from approximately 20,000 voters (the number of valid votes cast in Denmark proper at the latest election, divided by 175—the equivalent of one seat; after the 2019 election the required number is 20,195). As of 2016, it is possible to submit and collect signatures digitally.
;Voter requirements
* Denmark has universal suffrage for all citizens 18 years and older who live in the realm and who have not been declared incapable of managing their own affairs. The constitution makes it possible to restrict suffrage for convicted criminals and people receiving social benefits, but this option has not been used for several decades.
* All voters who have not been convicted of criminal acts that makes them unworthy for a seat in the parliament, are eligible. Parliament decides if a member is eligible or not (after their election). Parliament can also decide that an incumbent member is ineligible, if a member is convicted of a crime during a term. This happened after the Impeachment of Inger Støjberg in 2021.
;Parliamentary privileges
* Members enjoy immunity, meaning that no criminal charges may be brought against an MP, unless they are caught red-handed, provided the Folketing does not lift the immunity. The purpose of this is to prevent political persecution. In practice the Folketing has almost always lifted the immunity when a member has been accused of a crime, usually with the consent of the accused member themself.
* Debates can be conducted behind closed doors, although this has not happened since 9 April 1940, day of the German invasion in World War II.
;Ministers
* Ministers may hold a seat in parliament, but they do not need to. Supreme Court judges—according to convention—may not hold a seat whilst also acting as judges.
* Ministers may—even if they are not MPs—demand talking time whenever they want.
;Legislating
* Bills may be brought before parliament by members (private member&#x27;s bills) and ministers. Bills are predominantly brought before parliament by ministers, because they have the Law Office of the Ministry of Justice at their disposal. Instead of putting forward a private bill, the opposition usually put forward a proposal for parliamentary decision, i.e., a short resolution that addresses the subject and directs the relevant minister to propose a bill concerning it.

==Forming a parliament==

The 179 members of the folketing are directly elected to four-year terms, subject to calls for early elections. All Danish citizens 18 years or older may vote in legislative elections, which are conducted by secret ballot.
Folketing seats are allocated among the various parties using the D&#x27;Hondt method of party list proportional representation. A party or electoral alliance must pass the election threshold of 2% of the overall vote to be allocated a seat.

===Coalition governments===

The Danish political system is characterised by a fusion of powers, with the government being drawn from the ranks of the Folketing. Denmark is governed by a cabinet and a prime minister who do not have a majority in the Folketing against them (negative parliamentarism). Since no single party in Denmark has had an absolute majority in the Folketing since 1903, in order to pass laws, the prime minister must form alliances with parties outside his or her own party. This either results in a coalition cabinet of multiple parties, or a single-party minority government.

During his first term in 2009 to 2011, Lars Løkke Rasmussen led a centre-right minority government consisting of the Liberal Party () and the Conservative People&#x27;s Party. This coalition government worked with regular parliamentary support from the national conservative Danish People&#x27;s Party and often gained the necessary 90th seat for majority in the Folketing through negotiations with either the sole MP from the Christian Democrats, Ørum-Jørgensen or another MP outside parties, Christmas Møller, both elected in 2007 as conservative MPs and having defected since then.

Since the 2007 elections, the Liberal Alliance (previously Ny Alliance) gained momentum in opinion polls, and since early 2010 the governing coalition have not been able to gather a majority in the polls without the support of the Alliance. The continuing rise in the polls is to an extent the result of the internal crisis in the Conservative People&#x27;s Party over the leadership of Lene Espersen and the continuing debate over a lack of &quot;true&quot; liberal/conservative ideology in government policy.

On 13 January 2011 the continuing turmoil in the Conservative group in the Folketing caused Lene Espersen to resign as political leader of the party and focus on her role as Minister of Foreign Affairs. A leadership election between Brian Mikkelsen, the Minister of Economic and Business Affairs and Lars Barfoed, the Justice Minister, was widely expected, but on 14 January the Conservative group in the Folketing unanimously elected Barfoed as their new political leader.

The Social Democrats under the leadership of Helle Thorning-Schmidt have enjoyed continuing majorities in opinion polls since late 2009 and hope to form a centre-left government coalition consisting of the Socialist People&#x27;s Party and the Social Liberal Party with parliamentary support from the small Red-Green Alliance.

Both Margrethe Vestager (Social Liberal Party) and Villy Søvndal (Socialist People&#x27;s Party) pledged their support to Thorning-Schmidt before the 2011 election. But there has been considerable debate about the future politics of this coalition, mainly because the Social Liberal Party demands a more liberal economic agenda. Also on immigration issues there are political differences between the three coalition parties. This has led some observers to believe that the Social Liberal Party will not join a government coalition but instead opt to be a part of the parliamentary support of a new, centre-left government. In the event the Social Liberals did join the new three-party coalition government formed on 3 October.

Following the 2015 general election, Thorning-Schmidt was replaced as prime minister by her predecessor Lars Løkke Rasmussen. Until 28 November 2016, he led a government consisting only of Venstre—a very unusual situation in Danish politics.

== Organisation ==

=== Speaker ===

The Speaker is the presiding officer of the Folketing. The Speaker determines which members may speak, and is responsible for maintaining order during debates. The position was created in 1850, and the inaugural holder of the office was Carl Christoffer Georg Andræ. The current Speaker is Søren Gade of . The Speaker and four Deputy Speakers are elected by MPs at the opening of parliament after each general election and compose presidium of the body.
=== Standing committees ===

The members of parliament are allocated into thirty standing parliamentary committees. The standing committees have a portfolio that covers that of one or more government ministers.

==Composition==
===Demographics===
Although Denmark is a representative democracy, a bias is seen in the demographics of the Folketing as opposed to the demographics of Denmark, with middle-aged men over-represented, the Folketing is therefore not a direct representation of the country.

About one-third of seats have been switched for new members every election, a figure that has stayed more or less constant over previous elections. The largest change in these figures was seen in the election of 1973, where 45 percent of seats saw new members, and the lowest change was in the election of 1988, when 14.8 percent of members were newcomers.

Since the incorporation of women into the Folketing in 1915, a general rise in the seats held by women has been observed. In the most recent election in 2022, 78 of 179 seats were held by women.

===Historical composition===

Between 1918 and 1920 the Folketing had 140 seats, this was then increased to 149. The number was increased to 179 in 1953, which it remains to this day.

<text>The International Rose Test Garden is a rose garden in Washington Park in Portland, Oregon, United States. There are over 10,000 rose bushes of approximately 650 varieties. The roses bloom from April through October with the peak coming in June, depending on the weather. New rose cultivars are continually sent to the garden from many parts of the world and are evaluated on several characteristics, including disease resistance, bloom formation, color, and fragrance. It is the oldest continuously operating public rose test garden in the United States and exemplifies Portland&#x27;s nickname, &quot;City of Roses&quot;. The garden draws an estimated 700,000 visitors annually.

==History==
In 1915 Jesse A. Currey, president of Portland&#x27;s Rose Society and Sunday editor of the Oregon Journal, convinced city officials to institute a rose test garden to serve as a safe haven during World War I for hybrid roses grown in Europe. Rose lovers feared that these unique plants would be destroyed in the bombings. The Park Bureau approved the idea in 1917 and by early 1918, hybridists from England began to send roses.

A decade before the test garden was proposed, of Portland&#x27;s streets had been lined with rose bushes for the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Portland was already dubbed &quot;The City of Roses&quot; and the test garden was a way to solidify the city&#x27;s reputation as a rose-growing center internationally.

In early 1918, the garden began receiving plants from growers in England and Ireland, as well as Los Angeles, Washington and the Eastern United States. In 1921 Florence Holmes Gerke, the landscape architect for the city of Portland, was charged with designing the International Rose Test Garden and the amphitheatre. The garden was dedicated in June 1924. Currey was appointed as the garden&#x27;s first rose curator and served in that capacity until his death in 1927. Since 1940, the rose garden has been one of the official testing gardens for what is now called the All-America Rose Selections.

Originally, the garden occupied about a block, sandwiched between a playground and an elk corral. A parking lot replaced the original rose garden when the garden moved to its current location in 1928. The garden later expanded in the 1950s when Washington Park&#x27;s zoo moved to its current location.

The award called Portland&#x27;s Best Rose was established in 1996. Rose experts from around the world attend a one-day judging in June and select the best rose that day from thousands of submissions. Portland remains the only North American city to issue such an award.

By 2013, the garden&#x27;s collection had expanded to over 10,000 rose bushes of over 650 varieties.

==Features==
The International Rose Test Garden covers in several tiers facing downtown Portland, the Willamette River, and East Portland. On clear days, there are views of the Cascade Range, with Mount Hood featured prominently. The Queens Walk is a brick walkway at the base of the garden with bronze plaques featuring each Queen&#x27;s hand written name and year, honoring each Rose Festival queen since 1907. The plaques originally were installed in Lambert Gardens near Reed College, but were moved to the International Rose Test Garden in the early 1950s.

The roses and other plantings are tended by three paid staffers and dozens of volunteers. The garden is one of eleven American Garden Rose Selections test sites in the United States. Rose breeders and distributors from across the world typically donate about 2,500 roses per year to the garden. Sometimes the garden gets roses a year or two before they&#x27;re introduced to the market, but most of the roses in the garden are commercially available. The garden features an inventory that shows the names and locations for all of the roses.

The Rose Garden Store opened May 1, 2000. The store sells rose-themed books, merchandise, and garden supplies. The garden includes an amphitheater designed with the original garden. It hosts many events throughout the year, predominantly classical music concerts and a few plays. During good weather, the amphitheater is popular for picnicking and flying disc games. The &quot;Frank E. Beach Memorial Fountain&quot; (officially titled &quot;Water Sculpture&quot;) is an abstract stainless steel sculpture and fountain along the main promenade, designed and built by Oregon artist Lee Kelly and dedicated in 1975. The fountain honors Frank Edwin Beach (1853–1934), the man who is said to have christened Portland the &quot;City of Roses&quot; and who first proposed the annual Rose Festival. &quot;Royal Rosarian&quot; is a bronze statue depicting a Royal Rosarian tipping his hat. It was created by American artist Bill Bane and dedicated in 2011.

===Gardens===
The American Garden Rose Selection (AGRS) test garden covers two terraces of the Rose Garden. The roses testing in the garden are identified by number rather than by name; the plants are evaluated for two years by multiple criteria before being judged. The Gold Award Garden, dedicated in 1970, features award-winning roses from the AGRS Test Garden. The garden features a gazebo added in 1991, and a wall honoring past presidents of the Portland Rose Society. It is a popular site for weddings.

The Royal Rosarian Garden displays roses honoring past Prime Ministers of the Royal Rosarians, a civic group which serves as the official greeters and goodwill ambassadors for the City of Portland who serve in the many Rose Festival events, and features a stone bench honoring Jesse Currey. The Royal Rosarian Garden contains many roses that are no longer commercially available.

Established in 1975, the Miniature Rose Garden is a test ground to help determine what miniature roses will go to market. The Miniature Rose Garden is one of only eight such miniature rose testing grounds for the American Rose Society. The national annual American Rose Society winners are displayed in the middle of the garden along the center aisle.

The Shakespeare Garden was donated by the Shakespeare Society in 1943. It originally featured botanicals mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare. Over time, the Shakespeare Garden has evolved, planted with summer annuals, tropical plants, year-round shrubs, and roses. The rose varieties are named after characters in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. The Shakespeare Garden includes a formal walkway and a raised sitting area.

==Public access==
Parking at the International Rose Test Garden costs $2 per hour, to a maximum of $8 per day. The rose garden is served by TriMet bus route 63-Washington Park, which runs seven days a week. Washington Park Shuttle, a free service which connects the Rose Garden to MAX light rail at the Washington Park station, operates seven days a week from April through October, and only on weekends from November through March.

<doc id="429746" wikidata="Q3399484" url="?curid=429746" title="Marston, Oxford">
<text>Marston is a village in the civil parish of Old Marston about northeast of the centre of Oxford, England. It was absorbed within the city boundaries in 1991. It is commonly called Old Marston to distinguish it from the suburb of New Marston that developed between St. Clement&#x27;s and the village in the 19th and 20th centuries. The A40 Northern Bypass, part of the Oxford Ring Road forms a long north-west boundary of the village and parish and a limb, namely a distributary, of the Cherwell forms the western boundary.

==History==
The toponym is said to come from &quot;Marsh-town&quot;, because of the low-lying nature of the land, still green space, near the River Cherwell, which in earlier times was liable to frequent flooding. The parish used to be part of the manor of Headington. The Church of England parish church of St Nicholas began as a chapel, first mentioned in a charter of 1122 by which it was granted to the Augustinians canons of St Frideswide&#x27;s Priory. The building dates from the 12th century, and has substantial additions in the 15th century.

The village played an important part in the Civil War, during the siege of Oxford. While the Royalist forces were besieged in the city, which had been used by King Charles I as his capital, the Parliamentary forces under Sir Thomas Fairfax had quarters in Marston, and used the church tower as a lookout post for viewing the enemy&#x27;s artillery positions in what is now the University Parks. Oliver Cromwell visited Fairfax at Manor House, which is now known as &quot;Cromwell House&quot; at 17 Mill Lane, and &quot;Manor House&quot; at 15 Mill Lane, and the Treaty for the Surrender of Oxford was signed there in 1646.

In the 20th-century expansion of Oxford, new housing followed the Marston Road from St Clement&#x27;s towards Marston, which was soon absorbed by the city. New Marston became a separate parish in the 1950s. Old Marston parish become part of the City of Oxford in 1991. It retains its (civil) parish council. Marston has had a number of notable residents, including members of the Oxford penicillin team: Howard Florey and his second wife Margaret Jennings, and Norman Heatley. The village has been associated with the origin of the Jack Russell breed of terrier.

==Amenities==
A cycle route links Marston with central Oxford &quot;via&quot; the meadows west of New Marston, over a bridge on the River Cherwell, past the southern boundary of The Parks to the junction of South Parks Road and St Cross Road near the Science Area of Oxford University. It is also possible to walk on footpaths across the meadows to the Parks, either via Mesopotamia Walk or Rainbow Bridge.

<text>U.S. Route 75 is a north–south U.S. Highway that runs in the central United States. The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is located at the Canadian border near Noyes, Minnesota, at a now-closed border crossing. From this point, the highway once continued farther north as Manitoba Highway 75. Its southern terminus is located at Interstate 345 (I-345) and Texas State Highway Spur 366 (Spur 366) in Dallas, Texas, where US 75 is known as North Central Expressway.

US 75 was previously a cross-country route, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico at Galveston, Texas, but the entire segment south of Dallas has been decommissioned in favor of I-45; a cutoff section of town-to-town surface road having become Texas State Highway 75.

==Route description==

===Texas===

The first freeway in Texas was a several-mile stretch of US 75 (now I-45)—The Gulf Freeway—opened to Houston traffic on October 1, 1948. The stretch of US 75 between I-30 and the Oklahoma state line has exits numbered consecutively from 1 to 75 (with occasional A and B designations), excluding 9-19. All other Texas freeways that have exit numbers are coordinated with mile markers.

US 75 and Interstate 635 cross at the High Five Interchange, a five level exchange in Dallas, Texas.

North of Denison, US 75 runs concurrently with US 69.

===Oklahoma===

US 75 remains concurrent to US 69 from the Texas border north to Atoka. While US 69 continues to the northeast as a multilane highway, US 75 turns north to serve several small communities between Atoka and Henryetta. Through travellers bypass this segment of US 75 via US 69 and the Indian Nation Turnpike, where the speed limit is .

From Henryetta through Tulsa and on through Bartlesville to the Kansas State Line, US 75 is once again a multilane highway.

In the early 1990s, some portions of US 75 in Oklahoma were slated to become part of the Interstate Highway System. The 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) states that &quot;upon the request of the Oklahoma State highway agency, the Secretary shall designate the portion of United States Route 69 from the Oklahoma–Texas State line to Checotah in the State of Oklahoma as a part of the Interstate System.&quot; This would have created an Interstate route from I-40 south to the Texas line, including the portion of US 75 co-signed with US 69 south of Atoka. The legislation was unclear whether the route would enter Texas to connect with or become an extension of I-45. A current plan is to construct a new segment of the Oklahoma Turnpike along the US 69 corridor to bring it to corridor standards.

===Kansas===

A major north–south artery in Kansas, US 75 enters the state at Caney. It passes through Independence and crosses I-35 south of Olivet at the BETO Junction. From I-35 to Melvern Lake, US 75 is a Super-2 highway, with controlled access interchanges at Township Road, K-278, and K-31 southbound. From Melvern Lake to just north of Lyndon, US 75 and K-31 share a long concurrency. At US 56 near Scranton US 75 becomes a freeway. There is no direct access to the Kansas Turnpike from US 75, but the highway joins with I-470 less than from I-470&#x27;s interchange with the turnpike. US 75 and I-470 run together along the west side of Topeka to I-70. US 75 turns east along I-70 for about before exiting northbound as a freeway. This freeway segment runs to Elmont, then becomes an expressway to Holton. The remainder of US 75 in Kansas is two lanes. The highway exits the state north of Sabetha.

There was a US 75 Alternate in Topeka. It was on Topeka Boulevard and was the route US 75 originally took through the city.

===Nebraska===
US 75 enters Nebraska south of Dawson. From Nebraska City northward, it closely parallels the Missouri River. A brief section that serves as a bypass for Nebraska City is an expressway called the J. Sterling Morton Beltway. Nebraska City itself is served with Business Route US 75. US 75 and US 34 overlap from Union to Plattsmouth. North of Plattsmouth, US 75 becomes the Kennedy Freeway, serving as an arterial highway through Bellevue and the South Omaha neighborhood of Omaha. It follows I-480 briefly through central Omaha before branching off as the North Omaha Freeway. From I-680 northward to Nashville ( south of Fort Calhoun) US 75 is an expressway. South of Nashville it becomes a two-lane road again. It is briefly concurrent with US 30 in Blair. It joins with US 77 at Winnebago. The two highways run together until their junction with I-29 and US 20 at South Sioux City. US 75 follows I-29 and US 20 towards the Missouri River and Iowa.

===Iowa===

US 75 is a major north–south artery in the northwestern corner of Iowa. It enters the state by a Missouri River crossing at Sioux City concurrent with I-29 and US 20. US 75 and US 20 run together on a freeway bypass around the southeast side of Sioux City before US 20 turns east at Gordon Drive. US 75 continues as a freeway to the Woodbury–Plymouth county line, where it becomes an expressway. This expressway becomes a freeway bypass of Le Mars. North of Le Mars, US 75 exits off the freeway bypass, which continues on as Iowa Highway 60, and turns north. US 75 continues as a two-lane, undivided highway passing through Sioux Center and Rock Rapids before leaving the state north of Iowa Highway 9.

The segment from the Missouri River to LeMars is part of a larger expressway project that will eventually provide a direct connection between Sioux City and the Twin Cities region in Minnesota.

===Minnesota===

In Minnesota, US 75 stays very close to the state&#x27;s western border. It passes through few large towns. US 75 enters Minnesota south of Luverne near Ash Creek and Steen, and passes through Pipestone, Canby, and Breckenridge. It is the main north–south route through Moorhead. North of Moorhead, the route turns northeast to pass through Crookston (east of Grand Forks, North Dakota), then turns northwest towards the Red River of the North. US 75 does not cross the Red River, ending instead at the Canadian border at the unincorporated community of Noyes. It is not legally possible to cross the border at Noyes as the Noyes–Emerson East Border Crossing closed in July 2006 (however, since there is no security, it is possible to illegally bypass the old crossing into Emerson). Border traffic is instead directed to the nearby crossing in Pembina, North Dakota, (via MN 171, ND 59 and I-29). Manitoba Highway 75 previously continued on the other side of the Noyes border crossing, but has since been rerouted to the Pembina crossing.

All of US 75 in Minnesota is officially designated the &quot;Historic King of Trails&quot;, sponsored by the towns along the route. The &quot;King of Trails&quot; was in fact the historic Auto Trail name for this road before the trunk highway system was commissioned in 1920.

Legally, the Minnesota section of US 75 is defined as Routes 6 and 175 in Minnesota Statutes §§ 161.114(2) and 161.115(106).

==History==

===Texas===
In the initial assignment of state highways in 1917, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston were connected by a branch of SH 2 (SH 2, the Meridian Highway), which ran via Waco and Bryan and continued on to Galveston. The more direct route followed by US 75 was not initially part of the system between Richland (connected to Dallas by SH 14) and Huntsville (connected to Houston by SH 19). This Richland–Huntsville cutoff was added by 1919 as State Highway 32, and US 75 was assigned to the alignment, as well as SH 6 north of Dallas, in 1926. The branch of SH 2, which US 75 followed between Houston and Galveston, eventually became part of SH 6, and these numbers were dropped in the 1939 renumbering.

Prior to the coming of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s, the only improvements to US 75 in Texas beyond building a two-lane paved roadway were in the Houston and Dallas areas. The highways in and near these cities included some of the first freeways in the state, however: the Gulf Freeway (Houston) and the Central Expressway (Dallas). When Interstate 45 was built in the 1960s, its alignment bypassed many of the towns and built-up areas between downtown Dallas and Houston. The bypassed routes retained the US 75 designation until the designation was truncated to downtown Dallas in 1987. Many of the original alignments continue to exist under other designations.

In Dallas, the route followed what is now the Good Latimer Expressway (formerly Spur 559) southeast, out of downtown, along US 175 and south along SH 310.

Near Ferris, Trumbull, Palmer, Ennis, and Corsicana I-45 veers east to avoid the more populated areas. The old US 75 alignments through these towns, decommissioned in 1987, now carry the following designations:

*Interstate 45 Business (originally Loop 560) through Ferris
*Loop 561 through Trumbull
*Interstate 45 Business through Palmer (originally Loop 562)
*Spur 469, Interstate 45 Business (originally U.S. Highway 287 and Spur 563) through Ennis
*Interstate 45 Business (originally Loop 564) through Corsicana

Through Streetman, Fairfield, Buffalo, Centerville, Madisonville, Huntsville, New Waverly, Willis, and Conroe, US 75 followed what is now SH 75.

In Galveston, the alignment of SH 87 from 20th Street to the southern terminus of I-45 was also part of US 75 until its 1987 truncation.

In other cases alignments were bypassed while US 75 remained in existence; they now carry the following designations:
*SH 3 through La Marque, Dickinson, League City, South Houston and Houston, bypassed 1952
*SH 5 from north of Dallas via Plano, McKinney, Anna and Van Alstyne to Howe, bypassed 1959-1967
*SH 91 from Sherman to Denison, bypassed 1984
*Spur 503 and U.S. Highway 69 around downtown Denison to near Oklahoma
**SH 91 through downtown Denison, bypassed 1957

===Oklahoma===
The main line of US 75 between Okmulgee and Tulsa, known locally as the &quot;Okmulgee Beeline&quot;, is a modern four-lane highway. The prior route continues to exist, beginning with North Oklahoma Avenue in Okmulgee and becoming Old Highway 75 to the town of Beggs, Oklahoma. The part of the original route from Beggs north to the city of Sapulpa, Oklahoma was re-designated, together with a connecting segment along SH 16 between new US 75 and Beggs, as Alternate US 75, also signed as US 75A or SH 75A. Historically, the old US 75 met US 66 (now SH 66) in Sapulpa, and the routes were co-signed into Tulsa.

===Nebraska===
Development of US 75 in North Omaha was the source of much contention in when it was constructed. One state agency reports, &quot;Construction of the North Omaha Freeway, coupled with social unrest in the 1970s, greatly impacted the North Omaha area. One neighborhood experienced a 30 percent housing loss and major increase in crime.&quot; Further, the City of Omaha refused to complete upgrades to the freeway, eliminating the possibility of achieving the I-580 designation planned for it.

===Nebraska–Iowa===
From when the route was created in 1926 until 1984, US 75 left Nebraska in Omaha, crossing over the Missouri River into Council Bluffs, Iowa over the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge before 1966, and the I-480 Bridge from 1966 until 1984. US 75 then followed an alignment that went through western Iowa between Council Bluffs and Sioux City. After I-29 was built, US 75 was eventually moved onto I-29. In 1984, US 75 was rerouted into Nebraska to replace most of US 73. Previously, US 73 was concurrent with US 75 between Dawson, Nebraska and Omaha, and occupied the current segment of US 75 between Omaha and Winnebago.

<doc id="429754" wikidata="Q1515605" url="?curid=429754" title="Renaissance Tower (Dallas)">
<text>Renaissance Tower is a , 56-story modernist skyscraper at 1201 Elm Street in downtown Dallas, in the U.S. state of Texas. The tower is the second-tallest in the city, the fifth-tallest in Texas, and the 47th-tallest in the United States. Renaissance Tower was designed by the architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, completed in 1974, and renovated by architects Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in 1986. Major tenants include Neiman Marcus Group, Hilltop Securities and Godwin Lewis PC.

==History==
At the time of completion in 1974, it was the tallest building in Dallas at and was originally known as the First International Bancshares Tower (First International Bancshares, Inc. was the new holding company parent of First National Bank in Dallas). In 1985, it was surpassed by Bank of America Plaza, which became Dallas&#x27;s tallest building by far. It was also clear that Renaissance Tower would be overtaken by Comerica Bank Tower and Chase Tower then under construction. Therefore, in order to regain some status, the building underwent a major renovation in 1986 that included a re-glazed exterior and removal of the lighting on its sides. In 1986, James T. Chiles was brought in by the owner, the Prudential Insurance Company of America to design the broadcast center and towers on top the building, one of which was . This brought the structural height of the building up to , securing its place as the second-tallest building in Dallas. Excluding antennas and spires, the Renaissance Tower is the fifth-tallest.

Dan Goodwin, a high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate, scaled the outside of the Renaissance Tower on November 7, 1981, clad in a Spider-Man suit and using only suction cups and his hands and feet to climb the outside of the building. Goodwin later stated he made the climb as a gift to a young Dallas boy stricken with cystic fibrosis whom he had met shortly after his ascent of Chicago&#x27;s Sears Tower on May 25, 1981. Goodwin scaled the Renaissance Tower on his twenty-sixth birthday.

In 1986, Winstead PC moved from the Mercantile National Bank complex to the Renaissance Tower. In 2008, Winstead PC occupied almost of space in the building. During that year, the firm hired CB Richard Ellis to study possibilities for relocation. Winstead selected an Uptown Dallas as a location and relocated in 2012.

In 1996, Blockbuster Inc., which was then headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, began studying the idea of moving its headquarters, which consisted of 400 employees, into of space in the Renaissance Tower. In November 1996, Blockbuster confirmed that it was moving into of space on eight floors in the Renaissance Tower, choosing floor 23 as their center of operations. Blockbuster moved all employees out of Renaissance Tower in 2011 following its bankruptcy.

In 2014, Westhan Global Logistics moved from its company&#x27;s registered address to Renaissance Tower. Occupying a space on the seventh floor.

At the base of the building, there is a glass-pyramid structure that houses a two-story underground food court and cafeteria. The food court connects to other nearby structures with tunnels via the Dallas Pedestrian Network.

In May 2022, the building was sold to Gray Street Partners, a San Antonio, Texas real estate investment firm.

==Tenants==
Nationally recognized law firm Simon Greenstone Panatier, PC occupy Suite 3400.
*Previously Trizec Properties had its Dallas offices in Suite 3838.
*Westhan Global Logistics currently occupies Suite 2964*

==In popular culture==
The building lobby and exteriors were used for on location filming and for establishing shots for the home of the fictional Ewing Oil in Seasons 2-10 of the 1980s television series &quot;Dallas&quot;. Subsequently, the building was also used as home of the fictional company Ewing Energies on the 2012 reboot &quot;Dallas&quot;.

A room on the 54th floor was used as the OCP boardroom set in the movie &quot;RoboCop&quot;.

The building, like most of downtown Dallas, was featured in the music video &quot;Robo Sapien&quot; by German industrial band Die Krupps.

<text>Deryck Cooke (14 September 1919 – 26 October 1976) was a British musician, musicologist, broadcaster and Gustav Mahler expert.

==Life==
Cooke was born in Leicester to a poor, working-class family; his father died when he was a child, but his mother was able to afford piano lessons. Cooke acquired a brilliant technique and began to compose. From Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys he won an organ scholarship to Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he was taught by Patrick Hadley and Robin Orr. His undergraduate studies were interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served in the Royal Artillery and took part in the invasion of Italy. Towards the end of the war he became pianist in an army dance band.

Back in Cambridge, a number of his compositions were successfully performed, but he was insecure about their unfashionably conservative idiom, and eventually destroyed most of his works. After graduating in 1947 Cooke joined the BBC; apart from an interlude (1959–65) working as a freelance writer and critic, he worked for the corporation for the remainder of his life. His job involved writing and editing scripts for the music department and broadcasting for radio and television, where his thoughtful, unaffected manner made him an ideal communicator. In 1959 his first book, &quot;The Language of Music&quot;, argued that music is essentially a language of the emotions, and showed that composers throughout history had tended to choose the same musical phrases to express similar feelings or dramatic situations.

Beginning in the run-up to the Mahler centenary in 1960, Cooke (in association with Berthold Goldschmidt) made his first attempt at producing a &#x27;performing version&#x27; of the unfinished draft of Mahler&#x27;s 10th Symphony. Originally a lecture demonstration broadcast by the BBC in 1960, the first full (continuous) version was premièred on 13 August 1964 at the Proms by the London Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Goldschmidt. Revised editions followed, with the composers David Matthews and Colin Matthews assisting Cooke and Goldschmidt in the attempt to produce an authentically Mahlerian orchestration. Finally seen into print by Cooke and his collaborators in 1976, the work has now become a part of the repertoire.

Cooke&#x27;s last years were marred by ill health, and he died prematurely of a cerebral haemorrhage in 1976, at the age of 57. During the final years of his life he had worked on a large-scale study of Wagner&#x27;s massive operatic tetralogy &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. However, only part of the first volume, dealing with the text, was finished; it was published after his death as &quot;I Saw the World End&quot;. A collection of Cooke&#x27;s essays and talks was also published after his death as &quot;Vindications&quot;. Cooke&#x27;s archive is held at Cambridge University Library (CUL MS Cooke &amp; MS Add 10045).

<text>U.S. Highway 175 (US 175) is a east-west United States Numbered Highway located completely within the state of Texas. It comes very close to meeting its parent route, US 75, but decommissioning and rerouting in Downtown Dallas leaves it short a couple of miles. Before the decommissioning of US 75 south of downtown Dallas in favor of Interstate 45 (I-45), US 175 met US 75. US 175&#x27;s western terminus is in Dallas at I-45. The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is in Jacksonville at an intersection with US 69.

Much of the US 175 corridor (from I-20 in Balch Springs to US 69 in Jacksonville) is part of TxDOT&#x27;s network of evacuation routes in the event of a hurricane. TxDOT also considers the highway an alternative to using I-20 to travel to and from Dallas-Fort Worth, and feels the corridor is an important connection for students to get to Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, as well. Besides its hurricane evacuation route status, US 175 is considered part of the National Highway System, the Texas Trunk System (later revised to just the portion between Mabank and Jacksonville), and is also included in the state&#x27;s highway freight network.

Of all the three-digit U.S. Highways located within Texas, US 175 is the shortest.

==Route description==

===Dallas County===
US 175 begins south of downtown Dallas at an interchange with Interstate 45. At this point, US 175 is four lanes in width—two eastbound and two westbound. The highway is a freeway-style structure that is, at first, elevated over the nearby neighborhoods of Ideal and Bonton, in South Dallas. US 175 also carries the name of the C.F. Hawn Freeway here, named after Charles Fred Hawn, a former lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy from Athens.

After passing over State Highway 310 (the S.M. Wright Freeway), a third lane is added in each direction of the freeway. After passing Bexar Street and Municipal Drive, the freeway goes into a lowland area that includes a crossing of White Rock Creek, then the freeway turns southeastward at the Second Avenue/Bruton Road exit. US 175 comes back up from the lowland area at the Lake June Road exit.

US 175 passes through the Pleasant Grove area of Dallas past an interchange with Loop 12 (Buckner Blvd.), and then Interstate 20 a few miles later. The interchange with I-20 is a “stack” style, and is located just south of I-20’s interchange with Interstate 635 which US 175 also connects into; this is also a brief point where US 175 passes out of Dallas and into Balch Springs, then right back into Dallas. The freeway continues, but narrows to four lanes (two in each direction) at the I-20 interchange.

After the Woody Road exit, US 175 leaves Dallas and enters the city of Seagoville. On the east side of Seagoville, US 175 leaves Dallas County.

===Kaufman County===

As US 175 comes into Kaufman County, the surroundings become more rural. The freeway descends into a river valley and wetlands area, and then crosses the East Fork of the Trinity River. This marks the city limit boundary between Seagoville and Crandall.

After rising out of the valley area, the highway goes through Crandall by intersecting Farm to Market Road 741 (which connects Crandall to Forney), then passing the center of town, and another exit, with Farm to Market Road 148 (connecting Crandall to Terrell). A few miles later, a rural interchange for County Road 4104-Bud Stoy Road marks the city limit border of Crandall and Kaufman. The freeway continues into Kaufman past a wide right curve at the State Highway 243 interchange, then passes by a brief urban section at the Business State Highway 34 (Washington Street) exit. After another mile, an exit for State Highway 34 comes along.

After that exit, US 175 loses its freeway characteristics but continues as a four-lane divided highway. The highway proceeds for several miles before approaching Kemp. Here a bypass takes US 175 around the north and east of town, while the first of four business routes of US 175 goes through Kemp along US 175&#x27;s previous routing in the area. After the bypass makes its way past a freeway-style exit at State Highway 274 (which also forms the east end of Business US 175), US 175 leaves the main part of Kemp.

The highway continues as a divided four-lane road past two multi-bridge spans of Cedar Creek Reservoir. Between the two spans is the city limit border between Kemp and Mabank. After the second span of the lake, US 175 begins bypassing the main part of Mabank while another US 175 business route serves a through-town portion along a previous routing of the highway. One part of US 175 along its bypass is freeway-style, at an interchange with State Highway 198. The highway leaves Kaufman County just before completing its bypass of Mabank.

===Henderson County===
US 175 enters Henderson County as it approaches an at-grade intersection with the east end of Business US 175. The highway continues being divided with four lanes. A rural at-grade intersection with a county road marks the city limit border between Mabank and Gun Barrel City, then US 175 approaches a freeway-style interchange with State Highway 334. This state highway connects to the main portion of Gun Barrel City to the west, and is the last major road connecting US 175 to Cedar Creek Reservoir.
After the interchange, US 175 leaves the city limits of Gun Barrel City, and within a mile, it enters the city limits of Eustace. Soon afterward, the highway narrows to an undivided four-lane road with a left-turn lane. US 175 approaches its first signal light at the intersection of Farm to Market Road 316, which comes into Eustace from the south; the intersection is the beginning of a brief overlap of the two roads near the center of town. FM 316&#x27;s overlap concludes after four short blocks by turning left at another signal-lighted intersection to go north out of Eustace. US 175 continues out of Eustace and goes on another mile or so before becoming divided once again with four lanes. Once out of Eustace, US 175&#x27;s speed limit goes up to , the highest maximum speed of any segment of the highway.
US 175 continues southeast for several more miles, then it passes a state-maintained roadside picnic area, the only one on the whole highway. An intersection with Ranch to Market Road 2329 comes up right afterward, then within a mile, US 175 enters the city limits of Athens. A few more miles later, the divided roadway narrows again, to an undivided four-lane road with a left-turn lane. After another mile, US 175 intersects Loop 7; it begins bypassing Athens by turning left and overlapping the loop (as well as State Highway 31, which also bypasses Athens by way of the loop). At this same intersection, the third of US 175&#x27;s four business routes goes into Athens, along a previous routing of US 175. The portion of the route carrying US 175, SH 31, and Loop 7 is a four-lane highway with a left turn lane. On the north side of Athens, the highway intersects State Highway 19 with a grade-separated exit; the south-bound SH 19 bypasses Athens by merging with US 175, SH 31, and Loop 7 here while north-bound SH 19 turns left to go away from Athens, and a business route of SH 19 begins here to go south into the main part of town.
The four routes continue around Athens eastward past an at-grade intersection with Farm to Market Road 1616. SH 31 turns away from the four-route overlap at the next exit; it leaves by turning left (northeast) toward Tyler, while a business route of SH 31 turns right at the exit to go into Athens. US 175, SH 19, and Loop 7 continue their overlap around to the east edge of Athens, past a grade-separated exit of Farm to Market Road 2495. This road connects to Lake Athens and the Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center. A short distance later, US 175 turns away from SH 19 and Loop 7 at the next exit; US 175 goes left to return to its southeastward path, and the east end of Business US 175 is also found at this exit by turning right from the exit intersection.

The roadway US 175 takes after leaving the Loop and the southeast side of Athens is once again a divided four-lane. After a few miles, US 175 intersects Farm to Market Road 804 in the community of Baxter. The divided four-lane arrangement continues past rural, rolling terrain, then after several miles is an intersection with Loop 60 in the community of Larue. The signage at the at-grade turn to the left also points to an eventual intersection with Farm to Market Road 607. A short distance later is an intersection with Ranch to Market Road 2588, on the south side of Larue. A short distance further is another intersection with Loop 60.

Leaving the vicinity of Larue, and after a few miles, the LaPoynor consolidated school campus can be found on the left side of the highway; it includes a school zone with a speed limit of . For less than a mile along the north side of the highway, a service road can be found along the frontage of the school, which provides a safe connection and access for faculty and students. The service road continues a short distance further west past the school campus until an intersection with a local county road. About a mile past the school campus, at a county road crossing, is the city limits for the town of Poynor. Just before reaching the center of town, a left turn accesses the west end of Business US 175-H, which connects US 175 with Poynor&#x27;s main crossroad, Farm to Market Road 315. US 175 continues on as a bypass around the center of Poynor, crossing a bridge that spans but does not connect to FM 315. After another half mile, US 175 reaches the east end of Business US 175-H.
At this point, US 175 becomes part of the Texas Forest Trail, one of several posted regional byways across the state. The Trail wanders around to several protected forest areas and scenic spots around eastern Texas. About a mile further, US 175 reaches the city limit border on the east side of Poynor, then it leaves Henderson County around a mile after that.

===Anderson County===
US 175 enters Anderson County by continuing its divided four-lane arrangement. After a few miles, the four lanes narrow, excluding the dividing median, but including a left-turn lane. Not long afterward, US 175 crosses the city limit line of Frankston. US 175 also goes by the name of Pine Street in Frankston. A few blocks after entering the town, the business district can be seen, with Frankston&#x27;s downtown area just south of US 175. It is here where the highway intersects State Highway 155, the other major highway that serves the vicinity of Frankston. There is a full signal light at the intersection as well as a left-turn lane on each approach. This intersection marks the end of US 175&#x27;s segment of the Texas Forest Trail; from here, it turns north to follow SH 155. After SH 155, and over a hill, US 175 leaves the urban portion of Frankston and, for the first time along the road, the four-lane section narrows to two lanes.
The east city limits of Frankston is crossed in less than two more miles. An assortment of hills, climbing lanes, and gentle curves are encountered on the highway. At the top of a hill east of Frankston is an intersection with Farm to Market Road 1892; this road connects to the south end of Lake Palestine near its dam. After a gradual downward slope and at the bottom of a hill, the bridge crossing of the Neches River is reached; this is the point where US 175 leaves Anderson County.

===Cherokee County===

After the bridge span over the Neches River and into Cherokee County, and a short distance later, US 175 reaches the west city limit border of Cuney. There is not much of a town center besides a city hall and post office, mainly scattered stores, modest homes, and a church along the way. Just after crossing the east city limit border of Cuney, US 175 comes to an intersection with Farm to Market Road 855.

A left curve is ahead, then US 175 enters the community of Reese. There are two cemeteries, one on each side of the highway, then mostly homes and acreages in the community. Upon leaving Reese, there is a curve in the road to the right, then a slight ascent up a long hillside, with a climbing lane eastbound. At the top of the hill and around a wide right curve, US 175 approaches Cove Springs. The community is similar to Reese with mostly homes and acreages alongside the highway.

As US 175 departs Cove Springs, it descends a long hillside with a climbing lane on the westbound side. A county road intersection at the top of the next hill leads south into the community of Church Hill. Then US 175 descends down a slightly longer hill, and a slight right curve to an intersection with County Road 3405, which leads north. The site of the Killough Monument can be accessed by way of this same road.
Across from this intersection is a Texas Historical Marker commemorating the past existence of the Neches Saline Road (a part of which is traversed by County Road 3405), a path once used by Native Americans and early area settlers.

After another mile, a county road turns off to the right toward the community of Lakeview. A short hill ahead features climbing lanes in both directions. After another mile or so, US 175 approaches the city limit border on the northwest side of Jacksonville. This part of US 175 in Jacksonville is also known as Frankston Street. Between the city limits and the next street intersection, Pineda Street, an elementary school is on the right, with a special lower school zone speed.

A signal light after three blocks marks an intersection with Farm to Market Road 347 (North Bolton Street). For its final three blocks, US 175 changes street names to Alexander Boulevard and widens to four lanes with a left turn lane, with wide berms beyond the sides of the street, separating it from neighborhoods to the north and south. Another signal light ahead marks an intersection with U.S. Highway 69 (North Jackson Street); this point marks US 175&#x27;s eastern terminus.

==Business routes==
There are currently four business routes of U.S. Highway 175.

Business U.S. Highway 175-D (formerly Loop 346) is a business loop that goes east into Kemp from its intersection of US 175 west. The route runs along Elm Street to an intersection with State Highway 274, then turns left to go north, overlapped with SH 274, until intersecting again with US 175. Most of the route is part of a previous route of US 175. The Business route was created in 1991 and is long.

Business U.S. Highway 175-E is a business loop that runs through Mabank. This route runs on Mason Street, along a previous route of US 175, past an intersection with State Highway 198 until intersecting again with US 175. The business route was created in 1991 when US 175 was rerouted further north and east around town. The route is long.

Business U.S. Highway 175-G is a business loop that runs through Athens. This route runs southeast on a previous routing of US 175 from an intersection of US 175 west / State Highway 31 / Loop 7, to an intersection with Business SH 31, then turns left where the two routes overlap on Corsicana Street. At the center of town by the courthouse square, Business SH 31 turns left away from Business US 175-G. The road passes an intersection with Business SH 19 on the east side of the square, then proceeds east, then later curves to the southeast, eventually intersecting again with US 175 / Loop 7 (as well as State Highway 19). The route was created in 2004 when US 175 was rerouted to go to the north and east of Athens on Loop 7. Business US 175-G is long.

Business U.S. Highway 175-H is a business loop that passes through the town of Poynor. This route runs southeast on a previous routing of US 175 from an intersection of US 175 on the west side of town, past an intersection with Farm to Market Road 315, then intersecting again with US 175 on the east side of Poynor. The route was created in 2019 after US 175 was rerouted on a new bypass alignment to the south and east of town. Business US 175-H is long.

===Former Business routes===
There is one former Business Route along US 175. Business U.S. Highway 175-B was located in Crandall between 1992 and 2002 and was long. The route went southeast along Main Street from an intersection with the eastbound service road of US 175, to an intersection with Trunk Street, then turned left (northeast) until another intersection with the eastbound service road of US 175. This route had been previously designated Loop 219 before 1992; since 2002, though, the portions along Main and Trunk have been maintained by the city of Crandall.

==History==
An early figure in the formation of what would become US 175 was William Richardson, who settled with his family on land just northwest of Athens in late 1855. Richardson was called upon to help map out an early road path between Athens and Kaufman. The routing US 175 takes now in that area is based in part on what Richardson helped to plan.

For a time during the auto trails era, much or most of the path of today&#x27;s US 175 was part of the Hobby Highway. It followed a path from southeast Texas, through Beaumont, Nacogdoches, Jacksonville, Dallas, and on to Gainesville. It is uncertain how long the Hobby Highway naming was in existence, nor how well and often it was marked and signed.

Before 1920, and subsequently into the 1930s, a state highway, SH 40, existed from Beaumont to the Texas-Oklahoma border. The routing of SH 40 included a portion between Dallas and Jacksonville. It was this portion that became U.S. Highway 175 by July 1932. The other parts of SH 40 became parts of other US highways (US 77 north of Dallas by 1926; US 271 south of Jacksonville from 1930 to 1934, when the designation transitioned to US 69) as well (Map sources into at least the mid-1930s show a co-signing of US 175 and SH 40 along US 175&#x27;s entire route; it is unclear whether these were mapping mistakes of some kind or if the two designations were allowed as an orientative transition, if so, it is unclear as to for how long.). Traces of SH 40&#x27;s pre-US 175 route exist on 2 street signs, one near Cedar Creek Country Club (between Kemp and Mabank), the other just off SH 274 on the edge of Kemp. These changes phased out the SH 40 designation until almost 60 years later, when a short portion of highway in College Station was given the SH 40 designation in 1994.

As the U.S. system of highways was beginning to spread across the country, there were some routes—and routings—still to be decided. US Highway 77 was one of those. It had made it as far south as Dallas by 1930, but there would be more of it to the south to come. So far in Texas, the path to Dallas for US 77 was along SH 40&#x27;s route. A petition with over 1000 signatures favoring the extension of US 77 along SH 40 between Dallas and Jacksonville was brought to a September 1930 meeting of the Texas Highway Commission. The delegation heading up the presentation of the petition included W.W. Gibbard, president of the Highway No. 77 Association, R.A. Thompson with the Dallas Chamber of Commerce, and W.R. Cousins of Beaumont, a state Senator. At the meeting, the Commission went on to pass an order requesting the executive committee of AASHO (the American Association of State Highway Officials; now called AASHTO) to consider the US 77 extension. It is not exactly clear what eventually took place with the extension request, but US 77 would go on to be extended southward, toward Waco instead of toward Jacksonville, and of course, US 175 ended up being the numeric designation of the Dallas to Jacksonville SH 40 segment almost 2 years later.

In 1988, the portion of US 75 between Galveston and Dallas was truncated; this included much of South Central Expressway south of downtown. In US 75&#x27;s place, US 175 was extended north from the South Central-C.F. Hawn interchange to I-45; a separate numbering, SH 310, was used for the portion of South Central south of US 175. The state decreed in the mid-1990s that all of South Central Expressway south of I-45 be renamed for Sylvester (S.M.) Wright, who grew up just south of the future Hawn Freeway, in the Bon Ton neighborhood of South Dallas. A pastor at Peoples Missionary Baptist Church, Rev. Wright was influential in his community towards solutions dealing with race in the late 1950s and into the 1960s. George W. Bush, Texas&#x27; governor at the time, was in attendance for the rededication ceremony of the freeway.
On April 25, 2013, a minute order was issued by the state Transportation Commission authorizing the change of designation for US 175 to a new direct routing west to I-45. This extension is currently under construction.

At a meeting of the Texas Transportation Commission in January 2015, a minute order was issued authorizing the increase of US 175 speed limits in Kaufman County. In a reversal of what had been a reduction in 2001 of speed limits because of emissions concerns, the commissioners approved the change to a 70 mile per hour speed limit for the whole county. Previously, the part of US 175 between the Dallas County-Kaufman County line and the east side of Crandall had a 60 mile per hour speed limit; while the part from Crandall to the Kaufman County-Henderson County line in Mabank had a 65 mile per hour limit beforehand. By mid-April 2015, updated speed limit signs were in place in the affected area.

===Construction projects===

* In the 1950s, one of the first improvements along US 175 in Dallas occurred at a signal-lighted intersection in Pleasant Grove; it was the site of several previous accidents. The intersection was made into a freeway-style exit with grade separation and ramps. At the time of construction, US 175 had a vehicles-per-day count of more than 10,000 at the intersection. Right of way there, went from a width of to . The project commenced in February 1956, and was completed in March 1957. It is at the present-day site of the Loop 12-Buckner Blvd. exit off US 175.

* Not long after work commenced on the new freeway exit in Pleasant Grove, a new machine was being used for installing curbs of concrete down the center of streets surrounding the courthouse square in Athens. One of the streets was Corsicana Street, which was the through-town path of US 175 at the time (now Business US 175).

* In January 1964, a new west terminus was completed, connecting South Central Expressway with Second Avenue. This formed one of the first freeway segments in Dallas on US 175. It also, for the first time, bypassed sections of Dallas which had been served since 175 became a US highway some 32 years earlier. No longer would it connect Deep Ellum, Fair Park, or the Second Avenue corridor of South Dallas. The new freeway&#x27;s namesake, Charles (C.F.) Hawn, was a businessman from Athens who served on the Texas Highway Commission for six years. He was involved in the family&#x27;s lumber store, as well as banking, ranching, and development. After aiding in funding dilemmas between Dallas County and the city of Dallas, it was decided that the new freeway east of South Central Expressway in Dallas be named for Hawn. He was present at the dedication, which was attended by dignitaries and family from all along Highway 175, including Athens. The same day, a luncheon was held in Hawn&#x27;s honor at Market Hall in Dallas.

* Eight years later, in January 1972, an interchange with I-635 was completed. The interchange was constructed in a multi-layer &quot;stack&quot; style. I-635 was originally built along the northern, eastern, and southern sides of Dallas east of I-35E, but a transition between the late 1970s and 1990 eventually truncated I-635&#x27;s southern part back to just north of its interchange with US 175. The freeway that directly crosses at the US 175 interchange is now part of the path of I-20. Charles Hawn was present at the dedication for the interchange.

Along US 175&#x27;s path, several cities have been bypassed that previously had been served with through-town routings, including Seagoville, Crandall, Kaufman, Kemp, Mabank, and Athens. Other updates to US 175 have included widenings that have transformed much of the highway; it has become freeway over the years between Dallas and Kaufman, while further southeastward, US 175 has been widened to a divided four-lane highway as far as Baxter, in Henderson County.

The bypassed sections in Seagoville and Crandall came in conjunction with a new alignment between the two cities and a higher bridge over the East Fork of the Trinity River. In Kaufman, the bypass was built as a freeway style to the west and south of downtown, where US 175 was previously routed there. The center of Kemp was bypassed to the north and east in an incomplete freeway style. Mabank&#x27;s bypass came later, with a mostly freeway-style route to the north and east of town. The construction of Loop 7 around Athens was the catalyst for US 175&#x27;s bypass there; the city decreed that the loop would be made a truck route, so, as such, the city was able to get the state to reroute the designations of each highway serving the town (US 175, State Highway 19 and State Highway 31) to the loop, making each route bypass the city. US 175&#x27;s portion was signed afterward along the north and east sides of Loop 7. It appears that LaRue may have been first to be bypassed, but it is unclear as to whether it was formulated in the early years of US 175&#x27;s time, or if it was done while the path was signed as SH 40. The section in question is currently designated as Loop 60.

There have been many sections that have been widened, mostly to a divided four-lane arrangement, while some have four lanes with a left-turn lane in the middle of the highway. From Kaufman to Kemp, a previously two lane section was made into a four lane divided section, with crossovers to access each side of the highway. From Kemp to Mabank, a two lane section was made into a four lane divided section, with crossovers to access each side of the highway, along with new bridge spans over two sections of Cedar Creek Reservoir, which were built for the new westbound lanes. These were built higher than the bridge spans along the original two lane portion. A multi-phase project from Mabank to Athens began in 2006 to make a two lane section into a four lane divided section between Mabank and Eustace, which included a grade-separation for the intersection of US 175 and SH 334, then, a four-lane section with a left-turn lane within Eustace, then the other phase was widening the two-lane Eustace to Athens portion into a divided four lane highway. The work was completed by 2011. During the 1980s, a two-lane section of US 175 between Athens and Baxter was made into a four-lane divided highway.

* Between May 2001 and April 2002, US 175&#x27;s east terminus was relocated and straightened in Jacksonville. After many years of zigzagging its way to the center of town, the highway was finally rerouted to a new, wider path for its last three blocks prior to the new intersection with US Highway 69. Harold Alexander, a past city council member in Jacksonville, donated land for the straightening and improvements for the new east terminus and was a proponent of the project. The city named the new three-block section for Alexander at its dedication. There had previously been three east termini in Jacksonville: Frankston Street at North Bolton Street until sometime in the 1960s, when US 69 was rerouted off North Bolton; South Jackson at East Rusk Street, at the south end of a new railroad overpass; and North Jackson at Cherokee Street around 1999.

* In October 2016, a new bypass around the south and east parts of Kaufman was completed for State Highway 34; this project included a new exit on US 175. The exit on US 175 at South Washington Street, SH 34&#x27;s previous routing, became an exit for Business SH 34 after the opening of the new bypass. In August 2018, the SH 34 bypass bridge was named for longtime local Congressman Ralph Hall at a dedication ceremony.

* A three-phase project widened the portion of US 175 between Baxter and Frankston. One phase widened the highway from Baxter to just east of LaRue from a very narrow two-lane section to a four-lane divided highway; this phase began construction in April 2015. The second phase was from LaRue to just east of Poynor; it also made a very narrow two-lane section into a four-lane divided road, with a short service road-style section in front of the LaPoynor School complex, as well as a short bypass of Poynor&#x27;s downtown area that included a bridge over FM 315; work started on this phase in October 2015. The third of the three phases went from just east of Poynor to Frankston with a widening of a two-lane section to a four-lane divided arrangement. The Poynor–Frankston phase of construction was the last to be completed, in late 2019.
* In 2020, work was completed in South Dallas on a project to reroute US 175 off the S.M. Wright Freeway onto an extension of the C.F. Hawn Freeway. The extension goes from the former 90-degree curve at the S.M. Wright Freeway interchange (colloquially known as the &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot;) westward across South Lamar Street to a new interchange with I-45. This was part of the first phase of a transportation project known as the S.M. Wright Project. This project mainly aims to convert the S.M. Wright Freeway, the former alignment of US 175 through South Dallas, into a six-lane arterial with at-grade intersections. Other associated changes will be made to I-45 just north of the new US 175 interchange. The new interchange was only constructed with ramps from I-45 south to US 175 east and US 175 west to I-45 north. The first ramp from I-45 south to US 175 east was opened to traffic in March 2020 and the other from US 175 west to I-45 in early July 2020. 
* In 2021, a project was completed which switched the westbound on-ramp of FM 1389&#x27;s interchange and westbound off-ramp of the Malloy Bridge Road exit. Previously, each ramp was in close proximity to its crossing/intersection. Since the completion, the Malloy Bridge exit ramp is just west of FM 1389&#x27;s bridge overpass, and the entrance ramp to westbound US 175 from FM 1389 is now located in about the same placement as the previous off-ramp location for Malloy Bridge Road. None of the other ramps by FM 1389 or Malloy Bridge were switched or changed at that time.

===Native artifacts unearthed during construction project===

After construction commenced on a US 175 widening project between Baxter and Frankston, and prior to July 2015, at least three sites were found by construction workers that contained various items which included stone tools and ceramic vessels. Research showed that Natives settled or farmed in these areas between the 1400s and the mid-1600s. As the archeological process was still taking place by July 2015, TxDOT felt it necessary not to disclose the exact locations of the finds to ensure a secure process, as it is against the law to trespass on sites such as those. Construction workers were able to continue their work elsewhere on the widening project as the protected areas were being probed by investigators.

==Future==

* There are plans to continue and finish widening the remainder of US 175. The final segment, to be constructed in three phases, is 17 miles (27 km) between Frankston and Jacksonville. Right-of-way acquisition has not been finalized for the portion of the highway between the Neches River and Jacksonville.
* Another project involves adding a missing service road along the south side of US 175 between FM 148 in Crandall and the County Road 4106 exit; it wasn&#x27;t originally built when US 175 was made a freeway there due to close proximity to a parallel section of the Southern Pacific railroad (which has since been abandoned). Construction is scheduled to begin in 2020 and be completed by 2022.
* In conjunction with the service road project, a plan proposed by TxDOT would build a bypass for FM 148 to the east of the current alignment in Crandall; this would include a new exit and overpass at US 175. A public hearing was held in Crandall in August 2018 to inform residents there about project plans. According to those plans, letting for construction is due to take place by 2021.
* The intersection of FM 2860 between Kaufman and Kemp has been a candidate for years to be upgraded to a grade-separated, freeway-style exit, but funding hasn&#x27;t been set aside for this project.
* The US 175 bypass of Kemp is the site of another potential project, to make the intersections at Business US 175 west and at FM 1895 into full freeway-style, grade-separated exits, but no funding has been made available.
* A proposal by TxDOT to widen US 175 in Dallas from 6 lanes to 8 lanes between the SH 310 exit and the I-20 interchange is being studied; reportedly no funding is yet available for the project.
* Loop 9, a planned outer loop continuation of the Bush Turnpike, will run between US 67 south of Dallas and I-20 east of Dallas; it is due to intersect with US 175 east of the Malloy Bridge Road exit in Seagoville.
* A TxDOT project that would improve the US 175/I-20 interchange has been proposed. There are no specifics as of yet, other than the affected span (from the Masters Road exit east to the Edd Road exit), and the amount of funding it may need ($200 million) to complete it. No timeline has yet been posted, nor have any designs been made public.

===Current construction===
* Work is due to begin on East Corsicana Street (Business US 175-G) in Athens; TxDOT wants to change the lane arrangement between the downtown square and the beginning of the divided four-lane section on the east side of town. East Corsicana has been a four-lane street up to now, but the change will make the street two-lane with a left-turn lane. There have been reports of accidents on this part of Business US 175-G in the past due to no turn lanes.
* Work began in 2022 to widen US 175 to 4 lanes between Frankston and the Neches River. As of January 2023, several portions alongside the current highway were being cleared, but those were not yet the site of new construction. In Frankston, meanwhile, the US 175 eastbound lanes east of the SH 155 intersection were blocked off to traffic and the pavement had been removed.
* Work began in 2022 on a new bridge span of the Neches River at the Anderson County-Cherokee County line. This phase will add 2 westbound lanes across the river when completed.

==Major intersections==






















==In popular culture==
* In the reality series &quot;Police Women of Dallas&quot;, during transitions between scenes and in return-from-commercial-break bumpers, occasional evening shots of US 175 entrance ramps (signage included) could be seen, with the Dallas skyline lit up in the background.
* The &quot;Route 66&quot; episode &quot;1800 Days to Justice&quot; was filmed in Crandall, and used a previous routing of US 175 (Trunk Street) in one scene.

<text>The Outerbridge Crossing, also known as the Outerbridge, is a cantilever bridge that spans the Arthur Kill between Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and Staten Island, New York, United States. It carries New York State Route 440 and New Jersey Route 440, with the two roads connecting at the state border at the river&#x27;s center. The Outerbridge Crossing is one of three vehicular bridges connecting New Jersey with Staten Island, and like the others, is maintained and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The others are the Bayonne Bridge (also carrying Route 440), which connects Staten Island with Bayonne, and the Goethals Bridge (carrying Interstate 278), which connects the island with Elizabeth.

== Description ==

Constructed from 1925 to 1928, the bridge was named for Eugenius Harvey Outerbridge, the first chairman of the then–Port of New York Authority and a resident of Staten Island. Rather than calling it the &quot;Outerbridge Bridge&quot;, the span was labeled a &quot;crossing&quot;. The bridge&#x27;s etymology is sometimes incorrectly attributed to the fact that the Outerbridge Crossing is the most remote bridge in New York City and the southernmost crossing in New York state.

The bridge is of a steel cantilever construction, designed by John Alexander Low Waddell and built under the auspices of the Port of New York Authority, now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which currently operates it. It opened simultaneously with the first Goethals Bridge on June 29, 1928. Both spans had similar designs prior to replacement of the Goethals with the current cable-stayed bridge in 2018. Neither bridge saw high traffic counts until the opening of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 1964. Traffic counts on both bridges were also depressed due to the effects of the Great Depression and World War II.

The Outerbridge Crossing has undergone numerous repairs as a result of the high volume of traffic that crosses the bridge each day. On October 11, 2013, the Port Authority announced the completion of the bridge&#x27;s repaving project.

On March 2, 2017, Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye announced the funding of a study into a potential replacement bridge.

== Traffic ==
The Outerbridge Crossing carried 32,438,000 vehicles (both directions) in 2006, or approximately 90,000 each day.

== Tolls ==
, the tolls-by-mail rate going from New Jersey to New York City is $18.31 for cars and motorcycles; there is no toll for passenger vehicles going from New York City to New Jersey. New Jersey and New York–issued E-ZPass users are charged $14.06 for cars and $13.06 for motorcycles during off-peak hours, and $16.06 for cars and $15.06 for motorcycles during peak hours. Users with E-ZPass issued from agencies outside of New Jersey and New York are charged the tolls-by-mail rate. Frequent users traveling more than three trips per month can receive discounts under the &quot;Staten Island Bridges Plan&quot; ($8.03 per trip for cars at all times).

Tolls are only collected for eastbound traffic. Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. In August 1970, the toll was abolished for westbound drivers, and at the same time, eastbound drivers saw their tolls doubled. The tolls of eleven other New York–New Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were also changed to south- or eastbound-only at that time.

In 2003, the Port Authority raised the speed limit for the three inner E-ZPass lanes at the toll plaza from , separating these lanes from the rest of the eight-lane toll plaza by a barrier. Two years later, the tollbooths adjacent to the 25-mph E-ZPass lanes were removed and overhead gantries were installed with electronic tag readers to permit E-ZPass vehicles to travel at in special high-speed lanes. Motorists using the high-speed E-ZPass lanes cannot use exit 1 to Page Avenue, which is located immediately after the toll plaza.

Open road tolling began on April 24, 2019. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers are no longer able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, there are cameras mounted onto new overhead gantries located on the Staten Island side. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.

<doc id="429784" wikidata="Q1018482" url="?curid=429784" title="Bye Bye Birdie">
<text>Bye Bye Birdie is a stage musical with music by Charles Strouse and lyrics by Lee Adams, based upon a book by Michael Stewart.

Originally titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Steady&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; is set in 1958. The play&#x27;s book was influenced by Elvis Presley being drafted into the Army in 1957. The rock star character&#x27;s name, &quot;Conrad Birdie&quot;, is word play on the name of Conway Twitty. Twitty later had a long career as a country music star, but in the late 1950s he was one of Presley&#x27;s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll rivals.

The original 1960–1961 Broadway production was a Tony Award–winning success. It spawned a London production and several major revivals, a sequel, a 1963 film, and a 1995 television production. The show also became a popular choice for high school and college productions due to its variable cast size and large proportion of ensemble numbers.

==History==
Producer Edward Padula had the idea for a musical initially titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Steady&quot;, a &quot;happy teenage musical with a difference&quot;. Padula contracted with two writers and Charles Strouse and Lee Adams wrote seven songs for their libretto. Padula, Strouse, and Adams sought Gower Champion as director/choreographer, who until that time had choreographed only a few musicals. (Fred Astaire and Morton DaCosta had already declined.) However, Champion did not like the book, and the writers were fired. Michael Stewart then took their place. Stewart&#x27;s first draft, &quot;Love and Kisses&quot;, focused on a couple thinking of divorce whose children persuade them to stay together, a theme soon taken up by the Disney film, &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;.

Champion wanted &quot;something more&quot;. &quot;The &#x27;something more&#x27; had been right there in the newspaper. Rock-and-roll idol Elvis Presley was drafted into the Army in September 1957, and soon left the US for eighteen months in Germany, provoking a media circus that included Elvis&#x27;s giving a specially-selected member of the Women&#x27;s Army Corps &quot;one last kiss&quot;. After brainstorming, Stewart and Adams &quot;came up with the idea of a rock-and-roll singer going off to the Army and its effect on a group of teenagers in a small town in Ohio. The name of the singer initially was &#x27;Ellsworth&#x27;, which was soon changed to &#x27;Conway Twitty&#x27; before we discovered there was already a Conway Twitty who was threatening to sue us, and then, finally, &#x27;Conrad Birdie.

==Synopsis==
===Act one===
New York–based songwriter Albert Peterson finds himself in trouble when his client, hip-thrusting rock and roll superstar and teen idol Conrad Birdie, is drafted into the Army, leaving his heavily indebted firm Al-Mae-Lou Music (a spoof of the real-life Aldon Music) in jeopardy. Albert&#x27;s secretary, Rose &quot;Rosie&quot; Alvarez, comes up with a last-ditch publicity stunt to have Birdie record and perform a song before he is sent overseas. Having been stuck in a sort of romantic limbo for eight years, she longs for the Albert she once knew, an aspiring English teacher, before he wrote Birdie&#x27;s first hit and abandoned those plans to pursue the seedier music industry (&quot;An English Teacher&quot;). Rose&#x27;s plan is to have Birdie sing &quot;One Last Kiss&quot; (a song she assigns Albert to write on the spot) and give one lucky girl, chosen randomly from his fan club, a real &quot;last kiss&quot; on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; before going into the Army.

In Sweet Apple, Ohio, all the teenagers are catching up on the latest gossip about 15-year-old Kim MacAfee and Hugo Peabody going steady (&quot;The Telephone Hour&quot;). Kim reflects on how happy she is with her maturity, believing at 15 she has fully reached adulthood (&quot;How Lovely to Be a Woman&quot;). She quits the Conrad Birdie fan club over the phone because of the new milestone happening in her life. Her best friend Ursula is shocked. Kim reconsiders when, after a lengthy phone conversation with Ursula, she receives the phone call telling her that she has been chosen to be Birdie&#x27;s last kiss before going into the armed forces.

Meanwhile, Conrad, Albert and Rosie prepare to go to Sweet Apple. A crowd of teenage girls sees them off at the New York City train station, although one girl is sad because she thinks that by the time Conrad gets out of the army, she will be too old for him. Albert advises her to be optimistic (&quot;Put On a Happy Face&quot;). Soon, tabloid reporters arrive with questions about the seedy details of Conrad&#x27;s personal life, but Rosie, Albert and the girls answer for him, hoping to protect his reputation and bankability (&quot;Normal American Boy&quot;).

Conrad receives a hero&#x27;s welcome in Sweet Apple, and Hugo worries that Kim likes Conrad more than she likes him, but Kim assures Hugo that he is the only one she loves (&quot;One Boy&quot;). Conrad shocks the town&#x27;s parents and drives the teenage girls crazy with his performance of &quot;Honestly Sincere&quot;, which causes all of the girls (including Edna, the mayor&#x27;s wife) to faint. Conrad becomes a guest in the MacAfee house and irritates Kim&#x27;s father, Harry, by being rude and selfish. Harry does not want Kim to kiss Conrad, until Albert tells him their whole family will be on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Kim, Harry, Kim&#x27;s mother Doris, and younger brother Randolph sing Sullivan&#x27;s praises (&quot;Hymn for a Sunday Evening&quot;).

Albert&#x27;s overbearing mother, Mae, comes to Sweet Apple to break up her son&#x27;s relationship with Rosie (she objects to Rosie&#x27;s Hispanic heritage). She introduces Albert to Gloria Rasputin, a curvy blonde she met on the bus who could replace Rosie as his secretary. Gloria, a tap dancer, secretly hopes that a connection with Albert could be her way into show business. Mae sings &quot;Swanee River&quot; as Gloria tap-dances (usually depicted as her making a fool of herself). Albert gives Gloria a typing job. Rosie is furious, and fantasizes about violent ways to murder Albert (&quot;One Hundred Ways Ballet&quot;), but instead comes up with a better idea: she convinces Hugo to sabotage the last kiss.

Since both Rosie and Hugo are jealous and angry, they plot to ruin Conrad&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. On the broadcast, Conrad sings &quot;One Last Kiss&quot;, and as he leans in to kiss Kim, Hugo runs onstage and punches him in the face, knocking Conrad unconscious. Rosie dumps Albert who, trying to cover for the mishaps of the evening, then leads a chorus of &quot;Normal American Boy&quot;.

===Act two===
Despite plans to re-film the broadcast, Rosie and Kim resolve to leave Albert and Hugo, lamenting their stupidity for having fallen in love (&quot;What Did I Ever See in Him?&quot;). Conrad, with no visible effects from being knocked out, decides he wants to go out and have a good time on his last night as a civilian, and encourages the Sweet Apple teens to party (&quot;A Lot of Livin&#x27; to Do&quot;). Kim sneaks out of her house and joins her friends. Conrad, Kim, and all the teenagers, except Hugo, head for the Ice House, &quot;where people go when they want to be alone.&quot; Hugo goes to Maude&#x27;s Roadside Retreat, the town bar, hoping to get drunk, but grumpy proprietor Charles F. Maude sees that he&#x27;s underage and refuses to serve him.

When Harry discovers Kim has run away, he and Doris lament how disobedient kids are these days (&quot;Kids&quot;). Rosie ends up at Maude&#x27;s Roadside Retreat and starts flirting with other men, but Albert phones her and begs her to return to him (&quot;Baby, Talk to Me&quot;). Rosie interrupts a Shriners meeting in Maude&#x27;s private dining room. She flirts with all the Shriners, and they begin a wild dance. Hugo and Albert rescue Rosie from the crazed Shriners, and Albert finally stands up to his mother, telling her to go home. Mae leaves, but not before lamenting the sacrifices she made for him (&quot;A Mother Doesn&#x27;t Matter Anymore&quot;). Hugo tells the MacAfees and the other parents that the teenagers have gone to the Ice House, and they all declare that they do not know what&#x27;s wrong with their kids (&quot;Kids Reprise&quot;). Randolph joins in, stating that his older sister and the other teens are &quot;so ridiculous and so immature&quot;.

The adults and the police arrive at the Ice House and arrest Conrad for attempted statutory rape. Kim, who unconvincingly claimed to be in her late 20s to Conrad, claims she was intimidated and gladly returns to Hugo. After a reconciliation with Albert, Rosie tells Mae that she will marry Albert despite Mae&#x27;s racist objections, and despite being a natural-born American citizen from Allentown, Pennsylvania, she will deliberately play up her Hispanic heritage if it annoys Mae that much (&quot;Spanish Rose&quot;). Albert bails Conrad out of jail and arranges for him to sneak out of town dressed as a middle-aged woman, presumably so he can report for Army induction as scheduled; in turn, Conrad offers Albert a lifetime contract for bailing him out. Albert gets Mae to leave Sweet Apple on the same train, getting Conrad and his mother out of his life for good. Albert tells Rosie they&#x27;re not going back to New York; they&#x27;re going to Pumpkin Falls, Iowa, a small town in need of a (married) English teacher.

==Productions==
===Original productions===
In New York, the Broadway production opened on April 14, 1960, at the Martin Beck Theatre, transferring to the 54th Street Theatre and then the Shubert Theatre, closing on October 7, 1961 after 607 performances. The show was produced by Edward Padula and directed and choreographed by Gower Champion, with orchestrations by Robert Ginzler, scenic design by Robert Randolph, costumes by Miles White and lighting by Peggy Clark.

The original Broadway cast included Dick Van Dyke, Chita Rivera, Paul Lynde, Dick Gautier, Susan Watson, Kay Medford, Charles Nelson Reilly, and Michael J. Pollard. Reilly understudied as Albert Peterson for Van Dyke, who periodically took time off (including a two-week hiatus to film the pilot episode of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;) and returned to the leading role. During pre-production, Chita Rivera took the role of Rosie after both Carol Haney and Eydie Gormé turned it down, and the character&#x27;s last name was changed from &quot;Grant&quot; to &quot;Alvarez&quot;. Replacements during the run included Gene Rayburn as Albert and Gretchen Wyler as Rosie, both of whom joined the cast on April 9, 1961.

The musical played in July 1961 at the Los Angeles Philharmonic Auditorium as part of the 1961 season of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. After a two-and-a-half-week pre-run tryout at the Manchester Opera House, the show opened in London&#x27;s West End at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in June 1961, with Peter Marshall as Albert, Rivera reprising her role as Rosie, Angela Baddeley as Mae and Marty Wilde as Conrad Birdie. That production ran for 268 performances.

===1990 US tour===
A U.S. tour from mid-1990 through June 1991 starred Tommy Tune as Albert, Ann Reinking as Rosie, Marc Kudisch as Conrad, Marcia Lewis as Mrs. Peterson, Steve Zahn as Hugo, and Susan Egan as Kim.

===2004 Encores! concert===
The New York City Center Encores! staged concert production ran in May 2004, with Karen Ziemba as Rosie, Daniel Jenkins as Albert, Jessica Grové as Kim, and Bob Gaynor as Conrad.

===Kennedy Center productions===
An abridged version of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; was presented at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, October 2–5, 2008, as part of its &quot;&quot; production. Laura Osnes played Kim and Leslie Kritzer played Rosie.

From June 7-15, 2024, a new production was produced at the Kennedy Center, directed by Marc Bruni, and starring Christian Borle as Albert, Krysta Rodriguez as Rosie, Ephraim Sykes as Conrad, and Richard Kind as Harry MacAfee.

===2009 Broadway revival===
The Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s limited-run Broadway revival began previews at Henry Miller&#x27;s Theatre on September 10, 2009, opened to unanimously negative reviews on October 15, and was scheduled to close January 10, 2010 before it was extended until April 25. Due to poor advance sales after the departures of lead actors John Stamos and Gina Gershon&#x27;s contracts, the closing date was moved up by three months to January 24. Robert Longbottom was the director-choreographer, with Stamos and Gershon starring as Albert and Rosie, Bill Irwin as Harry MacAfee, Jayne Houdyshell as Mrs. Mae Peterson, Nolan Gerard Funk as Conrad, Allie Trimm as Kim MacAfee and Matt Doyle as Hugo Peabody.

Although Longbottom spoke extensively about how the show was being revised and refined for the revival, there were no interpolations from the film or TV adaptations of the show barring the title tune written for the film, which was used as a finale.

==Film and television adaptations==
===1963 film===

&quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; was first adapted for film in 1963. It starred Dick Van Dyke reprising his stage role as a slightly rewritten Albert Peterson, Maureen Stapleton as Mama Mae Peterson, Janet Leigh as Rosie, Paul Lynde reprising his stage role as Mr. MacAfee, Bobby Rydell as Hugo Peabody, and Ann-Margret as Kim MacAfee. Jesse Pearson played Conrad Birdie. Ed Sullivan makes a guest appearance as himself. The film is credited with making Ann-Margret a superstar during the mid-1960s, leading to her appearing with the real Elvis Presley in &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; (1964). The film ranked number 38 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;s list of the 50 Best High School Movies.

Several significant changes were made in the plot and character relationships in the film version. Albert is not Birdie&#x27;s agent but a talented research chemist who is struggling as a songwriter only to please his mother, who is overbearing and insensitive, but not racist as in the musical. He contributed to Birdie&#x27;s initial success, and therefore Birdie &quot;owes&quot; him a favor. The film version includes an additional character, a suave English teacher who flirts with Rosie. She plays up to him in several scenes after Albert has made her angry by caving in to his mother. The positioning and context of several songs were changed as well. &quot;An English Teacher&quot;, &quot;Normal American Boy&quot;, &quot;One Hundred Ways&quot;, &quot;What Did I Ever See in Him?&quot;, &quot;Baby, Talk to Me&quot;, and &quot;Spanish Rose&quot; were omitted from the film. &quot;Kids&quot; was performed in the MacAfee kitchen by Mr. MacAfee, Mama Mae Peterson, Albert, and Randolph. &quot;Put On a Happy Face&quot; was performed by Albert and Rosie in the MacAfees&#x27; back yard; &quot;A Lot of Livin&#x27; to Do&quot; was performed by Conrad, Kim, and Hugo at a teen dance; and &quot;Rosie&quot; was sung at the end of show by Albert, Rosie, Hugo, and Kim. Kim also opens and closes the film version singing the title song, &quot;Bye Bye, Birdie&quot;, a song written for the film. The film version ends on a brighter and lighter note than the stage musical. Conrad is not arrested, but Hugo knocks him out with a single punch &quot;live&quot; on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and wins Kim&#x27;s heart. Thus, there is no necessity for Albert to bail Conrad out of jail and arrange for him to sneak out of town dressed as a middle-aged woman, presumably so he can report for Army induction as scheduled. There is also no need for Conrad to offer Albert a lifetime contract for bailing him out. Albert&#x27;s mother shows up after the broadcast with Charles F. Maude (the bartender), informs Albert and Rosie that she has married him, and gives Albert and Rosie her blessing for their long-postponed wedding.

Van Dyke and other members of the Broadway production were unhappy with the film adaptation due to the focus shift to Kim. Van Dyke stated that Birdie was &quot;a romp&#x27;&quot; on Broadway, but they &quot;Hollywood-ized&quot; the movie. &quot;They made it a vehicle for Ann-Margret.&quot; Paul Lynde, who played Mr. MacAfee on stage and in the film, later quipped &quot;They should have retitled it &#x27;Hello, Ann-Margret!&#x27; They cut several of my and the other actors&#x27; best scenes and shot new ones for her so she could do her teenage-sex-bombshell act.&quot; Susan Watson, who created the role of Kim on Broadway, later said, &quot;Anyone who likes the film didn&#x27;t see the show.&quot; In January 2009, Adam Shankman signed on to develop and produce a remake.

===1995 TV movie===

A TV-movie adaptation was produced for ABC in 1995 by RHI Entertainment. It starred Jason Alexander in the role of Albert and Vanessa Williams as Rosie. Tyne Daly played Mae Peterson. Marc Kudisch, who played Conrad Birdie on tour opposite Tommy Tune, reprised the role. Chynna Phillips played Kim MacAfee, Sally Mayes played Mrs. MacAfee and George Wendt played Harry MacAfee. While this version remained mostly faithful to the original musical (Michael Stewart remains the only credited author of this version), several songs were added and re-arranged, and dialogue was slightly rewritten to smoothly facilitate the musical changes. The title song &quot;Bye Bye, Birdie&quot;, written for the 1963 film and sung by Ann-Margret, was re-arranged and rewritten as a quintet for Ursula and the Sweet Apple Birdie fan club girls at the soda shop. The verse of &quot;One Boy&quot; that Rosie sings was replaced with &quot;Let&#x27;s Settle Down&quot;. The reference to Sammy Kaye in &quot;Kids&quot; was cut. The &quot;How to Kill a Man&quot; ballet was cut. &quot;What Did I Ever See in Him?&quot; was given a reprise sung by Albert, called &quot;What Did I Ever See in Her?&quot;. The song &quot;Baby, Talk to Me&quot; returned to the show. &quot;Spanish Rose&quot; was moved to earlier in the story. &quot;A Mother Doesn&#x27;t Matter Anymore&quot;, sung by Mae Peterson was written for this version using some of the monologue it replaces. Albert tells Rosie how he has finally broken free of his overbearing mother in &quot;A Giant Step&quot;. This song was written for the 1990 US tour.

===&quot;Bye Bye Birdie Live!&quot;===
On October 27, 2016 it was announced that Jennifer Lopez would star in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Bye Bye Birdie Live&quot; as Rose &quot;Rosie&quot; Alvarez and executive produce with her producing partners Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina alongside film, TV, and live musical executive producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron. The live television musical was initially announced to premiere in December 2017, but on May 25, 2017, it was announced that it would be pushed to sometime in 2018 to accommodate Lopez&#x27;s busy schedule. On March 2, 2018, it was announced that the production had been pushed back once again, this time to 2019 at the earliest due to Lopez&#x27;s busy schedule and the producers focusing on &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert&quot;.

NBC had in May 2018 announced plans to broadcast a live production of &quot;Hair&quot; but canceled those plans in the wake of the failure of Fox&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in early 2019, as well as being up against the series finale of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and the season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;. NBC said it intends to replace it with a more family-friendly musical and noted that if Lopez&#x27;s cooperation could be secured, &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; could replace &quot;Hair&quot;.

However due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Bye Bye Birdie Live got cancelled indefinitely and was replaced by &quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27; The Grinch Musical Live!&quot; 

==1981 Broadway sequel==
In 1981, there was a short-lived Broadway sequel, &quot;Bring Back Birdie&quot;, starring Donald O&#x27;Connor and returning original cast member Chita Rivera. It closed after 31 previews and four performances.

==Critical reception==
The original production of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; opened to mostly positive reviews, with several critics marveling at the unexpected success of a musical crafted by an inexperienced production team. John Champman of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; called it &quot;the funniest, most captivating, and most expert musical comedy one could hope to see ... the show is pure, plain musical comedy, with jokes, dancing, oddball costumes ... exceptionally catching orchestrations ... and a completely enthusiastic cast.&quot; He noted that &quot;one of the best things about it is that practically nobody is connected to it. Who ever heard of Edward Padula ... Charles Strouse and Lee Adams ... Gower Champion?&quot;

Frank Aston of the &quot;New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun&quot; declared &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; &quot;the peak of the season&quot; and especially liked Chita Rivera as Rosie: &quot;Chita Rivera ... is triumphant as dancer, comic, and warbler.&quot; In the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot;, Robert Coleman wrote that &quot;Edward Padula put over a sleeper in the Broadway sweepstakes, and it&#x27;s going to pay off in big figures ... Rivera explodes like a bomb over West 45th Street. Michael Stewart has penned a sassy and fresh book, while Lee Adams and Charles Strouse have matched it with tongue-in-cheek lyrics and music.&quot;

&quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; critic Walter Kerr praised Gower Champion&#x27;s direction but criticized the libretto and score, stating that &quot;Mr. Champion has been very much responsible for the gayety (sic), the winsomeness, and the exuberant zing of the occasion ... he has not always been given the very best to work with ... every once in a while, Michael Stewart&#x27;s book starts to break down and cry ... Lee Adams&#x27;s lyrics lean rather heavily on the new &quot;talk-out-the-plot&quot; technique, and Charles Strouse&#x27;s tunes, though jaunty, are whisper-thin.&quot; Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; conceded that &quot;the audience was beside itself with pleasure&quot; but dryly stated that &quot;this department was able to contain itself. &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; is neither fish, fowl, nor good musical comedy. It needs work.&quot;

<doc id="429787" wikidata="Q6740961" url="?curid=429787" title="Malafrena">
<text>Malafrena is a 1979 novel by Ursula K. Le Guin. The only fantastic element of this novel is that it takes place in the imaginary Central European country of Orsinia, which is also the setting of her collection &quot;Orsinian Tales&quot;.

In many ways, &quot;Malafrena&quot; reads like a 19th-century novel, with its many detailed characters, its political and romantic subplots, its lack of the supernatural, and its settings that range from the mansions of the aristocracy to slums and a prison. 
&quot;Malafrena&quot; is written for an adult audience, rather than children and young adults, the target readership of most of Le Guin&#x27;s works in the period of 1979–1994.

== Plot summary ==
The story takes place from 1825 to 1830, when Orsinia is ruled by the Austrian Empire. The hero is &quot;Itale Sorde&quot;, the son of the owner of an estate on a lake called Malafrena in a valley of the same name. Itale leaves the estate, against his father&#x27;s will, to engage in nationalistic and revolutionary politics in the capital.

== Characters ==
* Itale Sorde: The protagonist of the story.
* Laura Sorde: Itale&#x27;s sister.
* Guide Sorde: Itale&#x27;s father.
* Emanuel Sorde: Itale&#x27;s uncle.
* Eleonora: Itale&#x27;s mother.
* Tomas Brelavay: School friend and collaborator in Krasnoy.
* Givan Frenin: School friend and collaborator in Krasnoy.
* Count Orlant Valtorskar: Neighbor and family friend.
* Piera Valtorskar: Neighbor and family friend.
* Luisa Paludeskar: A young noble woman in Krasnoy.
* Enrike Paludeskar: Luisa&#x27;s brother.
* Amadey Estenskar: A writer from Polana province.

== Literary significance and criticism ==
Mike Cadden notes that &quot;Malafrena&quot; has not received as much critical attention as many of le Guin&#x27;s other works, primarily because the characters in the story do not connect well with one another. An imperceptible, omniscient author is used to tell the story, and le Guin herself acknowledges one of the strongest influences on her Orsinian works is Russian literature.

In a review of &quot;Malafrena&quot;, Greg Costikyan commented that
: &quot;&quot;Malafrena&quot; seems to say that visionaries are often or usually destroyed, and though tragic, this must always be the case, for humanity cannot progress without them.&quot;

<doc id="429789" wikidata="Q1117940" url="?curid=429789" title="Coupled cluster">
<text>Coupled cluster (CC) is a numerical technique used for describing many-body systems. Its most common use is as one of several post-Hartree–Fock ab initio quantum chemistry methods in the field of computational chemistry, but it is also used in nuclear physics. Coupled cluster essentially takes the basic Hartree–Fock molecular orbital method and constructs multi-electron wavefunctions using the exponential cluster operator to account for electron correlation. Some of the most accurate calculations for small to medium-sized molecules use this method.

The method was initially developed by Fritz Coester and Hermann Kümmel in the 1950s for studying nuclear-physics phenomena, but became more frequently used when in 1966 Jiří Čížek (and later together with Josef Paldus) reformulated the method for electron correlation in atoms and molecules. It is now one of the most prevalent methods in quantum chemistry that includes electronic correlation.

CC theory is simply the perturbative variant of the many-electron theory (MET) of Oktay Sinanoğlu, which is the exact (and variational) solution of the many-electron problem, so it was also called &quot;coupled-pair MET (CPMET)&quot;. J. Čížek used the correlation function of MET and used Goldstone-type perturbation theory to get the energy expression, while original MET was completely variational. Čížek first developed the linear CPMET and then generalized it to full CPMET in the same work in 1966. He then also performed an application of it on the benzene molecule with Sinanoğlu in the same year. Because MET is somewhat difficult to perform computationally, CC is simpler and thus, in today&#x27;s computational chemistry, CC is the best variant of MET and gives highly accurate results in comparison to experiments.

== Wavefunction ansatz ==
Coupled-cluster theory provides the exact solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the Hamiltonian of the system, formula_3 is the exact wavefunction, and &quot;E&quot; is the exact energy of the ground state. Coupled-cluster theory can also be used to obtain solutions for excited states using, for example, linear-response, equation-of-motion, state-universal multi-reference, or valence-universal multi-reference coupled cluster approaches.

The wavefunction of the coupled-cluster theory is written as an exponential ansatz:

: formula_4

where formula_5 is the reference wave function, which is typically a Slater determinant constructed from Hartree–Fock molecular orbitals, though other wave functions such as configuration interaction, multi-configurational self-consistent field, or Brueckner orbitals can also be used. formula_6 is the cluster operator, which, when acting on formula_5, produces a linear combination of excited determinants from the reference wave function (see section below for greater detail).

The choice of the exponential ansatz is opportune because (unlike other ansatzes, for example, configuration interaction) it guarantees the size extensivity of the solution. Size consistency in CC theory, also unlike other theories, does not depend on the size consistency of the reference wave function. This is easily seen, for example, in the single bond breaking of F2 when using a restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) reference, which is not size-consistent, at the CCSDT (coupled cluster single-double-triple) level of theory, which provides an almost exact, full-CI-quality, potential-energy surface and does not dissociate the molecule into F− and F+ ions, like the RHF wave function, but rather into two neutral F atoms. If one were to use, for example, the CCSD, or CCSD(T) levels of theory, they would not provide reasonable results for the bond breaking of F2, with the latter one approaches unphysical potential energy surfaces, though this is for reasons other than just size consistency.

A criticism of the method is that the conventional implementation employing the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian (see below) is not variational, though there are bi-variational and quasi-variational approaches that have been developed since the first implementations of the theory. While the above ansatz for the wave function itself has no natural truncation, however, for other properties, such as energy, there is a natural truncation when examining expectation values, which has its basis in the linked- and connected-cluster theorems, and thus does not suffer from issues such as lack of size extensivity, like the variational configuration-interaction approach.

== Cluster operator ==

The cluster operator is written in the form

: formula_8

where formula_9 is the operator of all single excitations, formula_10 is the operator of all double excitations, and so forth. In the formalism of second quantization these excitation operators are expressed as

: formula_11

: formula_12

and for the general &quot;n&quot;-fold cluster operator

: formula_13

In the above formulae formula_14 and formula_15 denote the creation and annihilation operators respectively, while &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; stand for occupied (hole) and &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; for unoccupied (particle) orbitals (states). The creation and annihilation operators in the coupled-cluster terms above are written in canonical form, where each term is in the normal order form, with respect to the Fermi vacuum formula_5. Being the one-particle cluster operator and the two-particle cluster operator, formula_9 and formula_10 convert the reference function formula_5 into a linear combination of the singly and doubly excited Slater determinants respectively, if applied without the exponential (such as in CI, where a linear excitation operator is applied to the wave function). Applying the exponential cluster operator to the wave function, one can then generate more than doubly excited determinants due to the various powers of formula_9 and formula_10 that appear in the resulting expressions (see below). Solving for the unknown coefficients formula_22 and formula_23 is necessary for finding the approximate solution formula_3.

The exponential operator formula_25 may be expanded as a Taylor series, and if we consider only the formula_9 and formula_10 cluster operators of formula_6, we can write

: formula_29

Though in practice this series is finite because the number of occupied molecular orbitals is finite, as is the number of excitations, it is still very large, to the extent that even modern-day massively parallel computers are inadequate, except for problems of a dozen or so electrons and very small basis sets, when considering all contributions to the cluster operator and not just formula_9 and formula_10. Often, as was done above, the cluster operator includes only singles and doubles (see CCSD below) as this offers a computationally affordable method that performs better than MP2 and CISD, but is not very accurate usually. For accurate results some form of triples (approximate or full) are needed, even near the equilibrium geometry (in the Franck–Condon region), and especially when breaking single bonds or describing diradical species (these latter examples are often what is referred to as multi-reference problems, since more than one determinant has a significant contribution to the resulting wave function). For double-bond breaking and more complicated problems in chemistry, quadruple excitations often become important as well, though usually they have small contributions for most problems, and as such, the contribution of formula_32, formula_33 etc. to the operator formula_6 is typically small. Furthermore, if the highest excitation level in the formula_6 operator is &quot;n&quot;,

: formula_36

then Slater determinants for an &quot;N&quot;-electron system excited more than formula_37 (formula_38) times may still contribute to the coupled-cluster wave function formula_3 because of the non-linear nature of the exponential ansatz, and therefore, coupled cluster terminated at formula_40 usually recovers more correlation energy than CI with maximum &quot;n&quot; excitations.

== Coupled-cluster equations ==

The Schrödinger equation can be written, using the coupled-cluster wave function, as

: formula_41

where there are a total of &quot;q&quot; coefficients (&quot;t&quot;-amplitudes) to solve for. To obtain the &quot;q&quot; equations, first, we multiply the above Schrödinger equation on the left by formula_42 and then project onto the entire set of up to excited determinants, where &quot;m&quot; is the highest-order excitation included in formula_6 that can be constructed from the reference wave function formula_5, denoted by formula_45. Individually, formula_46 are singly excited determinants where the electron in orbital &quot;i&quot; has been excited to orbital &quot;a&quot;; formula_47 are doubly excited determinants where the electron in orbital &quot;i&quot; has been excited to orbital &quot;a&quot; and the electron in orbital &quot;j&quot; has been excited to orbital &quot;b&quot;, etc. In this way we generate a set of coupled energy-independent non-linear algebraic equations needed to determine the &quot;t&quot;-amplitudes:

: formula_48

: formula_49

the latter being the equations to be solved, and the former the equation for the evaluation of the energy. (Note that we have made use of formula_50, the identity operator, and also assume that orbitals are orthogonal, though this does not necessarily have to be true, e.g., valence bond orbitals can be used, and in such cases the last set of equations are not necessarily equal to zero.)

Considering the basic CCSD method:

: formula_51
: formula_52
: formula_53

in which the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian formula_54 can be explicitly written down using Hadamard&#x27;s formula in Lie algebra, also called Hadamard&#x27;s lemma (see also Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula (BCH formula), though note that they are different, in that Hadamard&#x27;s formula is a lemma of the BCH formula):

: formula_55

The subscript &quot;C&quot; designates the connected part of the corresponding operator expression.

The resulting similarity-transformed Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian, resulting in different left and right vectors (wave functions) for the same state of interest (this is what is often referred to in coupled-cluster theory as the biorthogonality of the solution, or wave function, though it also applies to other non-Hermitian theories as well). The resulting equations are a set of non-linear equations, which are solved in an iterative manner. Standard quantum-chemistry packages (GAMESS (US), NWChem, ACES II, etc.) solve the coupled-cluster equations using the Jacobi method and direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS) extrapolation of the &quot;t&quot;-amplitudes to accelerate convergence.

== Types of coupled-cluster methods ==

The classification of traditional coupled-cluster methods rests on the highest number of excitations allowed in the definition of formula_6. The abbreviations for coupled-cluster methods usually begin with the letters &quot;CC&quot; (for &quot;coupled cluster&quot;) followed by
# S – for single excitations (shortened to &quot;singles&quot; in coupled-cluster terminology),
# D – for double excitations (&quot;doubles&quot;),
# T – for triple excitations (&quot;triples&quot;),
# Q – for quadruple excitations (&quot;quadruples&quot;).

Thus, the formula_6 operator in CCSDT has the form

: formula_58

Terms in round brackets indicate that these terms are calculated based on perturbation theory. For example, the CCSD(T) method means:
# Coupled cluster with a full treatment singles and doubles.
# An estimate to the connected triples contribution is calculated non-iteratively using many-body perturbation theory arguments.

== General description of the theory ==

The complexity of equations and the corresponding computer codes, as well as the cost of the computation, increases sharply with the highest level of excitation. For many applications CCSD, while relatively inexpensive, does not provide sufficient accuracy except for the smallest systems (approximately 2 to 4 electrons), and often an approximate treatment of triples is needed. The most well known coupled-cluster method that provides an estimate of connected triples is CCSD(T), which provides a good description of closed-shell molecules near the equilibrium geometry, but breaks down in more complicated situations such as bond breaking and diradicals. Another popular method that makes up for the failings of the standard CCSD(T) approach is -CC(2,3), where the triples contribution to the energy is computed from the difference between the exact solution and the CCSD energy and is not based on perturbation-theory arguments. More complicated coupled-cluster methods such as CCSDT and CCSDTQ are used only for high-accuracy calculations of small molecules. The inclusion of all &quot;n&quot; levels of excitation for the &quot;n&quot;-electron system gives the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation within the given basis set, within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation (although schemes have also been drawn up to work without the BO approximation).

One possible improvement to the standard coupled-cluster approach is to add terms linear in the interelectronic distances through methods such as CCSD-R12. This improves the treatment of dynamical electron correlation by satisfying the Kato cusp condition and accelerates convergence with respect to the orbital basis set. Unfortunately, R12 methods invoke the resolution of the identity, which requires a relatively large basis set in order to be a good approximation.

The coupled-cluster method described above is also known as the &quot;single-reference&quot; (SR) coupled-cluster method because the exponential ansatz involves only one reference function formula_5. The standard generalizations of the SR-CC method are the &quot;multi-reference&quot; (MR) approaches: state-universal coupled cluster (also known as Hilbert space coupled cluster), valence-universal coupled cluster (or Fock space coupled cluster) and state-selective coupled cluster (or state-specific coupled cluster).

== Historical accounts ==
Kümmel comments:

Considering the fact that the CC method was well understood around the late fifties[,] it looks strange that nothing happened with it until 1966, as Jiří Čížek published his first paper on a quantum chemistry problem. He had looked into the 1957 and 1960 papers published in &quot;Nuclear Physics&quot; by Fritz and myself. I always found it quite remarkable that a quantum chemist would open an issue of a nuclear physics journal. I myself at the time had almost given up the CC method as not tractable and, of course, I never looked into the quantum chemistry journals. The result was that I learnt about Jiří&#x27;s work as late as in the early seventies, when he sent me a big parcel with reprints of the many papers he and Joe Paldus had written until then.
Josef Paldus also wrote his first-hand account of the origins of coupled-cluster theory, its implementation, and exploitation in electronic wave-function determination; his account is primarily about the making of coupled-cluster theory rather than about the theory itself.

== Relation to other theories ==

=== Configuration interaction ===
The &quot;Cj&quot; excitation operators defining the CI expansion of an &quot;N&quot;-electron system for the wave function formula_60,

: formula_61

: formula_62

are related to the cluster operators formula_6, since in the limit of including up to formula_64 in the cluster operator the CC theory must be equal to full CI, we obtain the following relationships

: formula_65

: formula_66

: formula_67

: formula_68

etc. For general relationships see J. Paldus, in &quot;Methods in Computational Molecular Physics&quot;, Vol. 293 of &quot;Nato Advanced Study Institute Series B: Physics&quot;, edited by S. Wilson and G. H. F. Diercksen (Plenum, New York, 1992), pp. 99–194.

=== Symmetry-adapted cluster ===
The symmetry-adapted cluster (SAC) approach determines the (spin- and) symmetry-adapted cluster operator
: formula_69
by solving the following system of energy-dependent equations:

: formula_70

: formula_71

: formula_72

where formula_73 are the excited determinants relative to formula_74 (usually, in practical implementations, they are the spin- and symmetry-adapted configuration state functions), and formula_75 is the highest order of excitation included in the SAC operator. If all of the nonlinear terms in formula_76 are included, then the SAC equations become equivalent to the standard coupled-cluster equations of Jiří Čížek. This is due to the cancellation of the energy-dependent terms with the disconnected terms contributing to the product of formula_77, resulting in the same set of nonlinear energy-independent equations. Typically, all nonlinear terms, except formula_78 are dropped, as higher-order nonlinear terms are usually small.

== Use in nuclear physics ==
In nuclear physics, coupled cluster saw significantly less use than in quantum chemistry during the 1980s and 1990s. More powerful computers, as well as advances in theory (such as the inclusion of three-nucleon interactions), have spawned renewed interest in the method since then, and it has been successfully applied to neutron-rich and medium-mass nuclei. Coupled cluster is one of several ab initio methods in nuclear physics and is specifically suitable for nuclei having closed or nearly closed shells.

<doc id="429797" wikidata="Q380318" url="?curid=429797" title="Quorthon">
<text>Thomas Börje Forsberg (17 February 1966 – 3 June 2004), better known by the stage name Quorthon, was a Swedish musician. He was one of the founders, as well as the sole songwriter, of the band Bathory, which pioneered the black metal genre and is credited with creating the Viking metal style. A multi-instrumentalist, Quorthon wrote the music and lyrics on all of Bathory&#x27;s albums and performed vocals and guitars.

== Career ==
Quorthon formed Bathory in 1983 when he was 17 years old, after briefly playing in the Oi! band Stridskuk, which also featured drummer Johan &quot;Jolle&quot; Elvén and bass player Rickard &quot;Ribban&quot; Bergman, who later played on early Bathory demos and in the case of Bergman, albums. He recorded his early albums together with the help of his father Börje Forsberg (1944 - 2017) who was also the head of the Swedish record label Tyfon Grammofon that would go on to release most of Bathory&#x27;s albums through the subsidiary Black Mark Production. The first album was recorded in the garage of schlager writer Peter Himmelstrand, dubbed Studio Heavenshore.

During the mid-to-late 1980s, live performances by Bathory were rare. Albums from this period contributed to the then-burgeoning black metal subgenre, and rare photographs of the band helped in part to define its image. Beginning in the 1990s, Quorthon took full control of Bathory, choosing to forgo performing live in order to spend time recording music with hired musicians, as well changing style from the black metal of the 1980s to a slower, heavier style which eventually became the founding of the Viking metal genre, due to its lyrics being focused on Norse mythology. From this point onward, he also played bass guitar on almost all of his albums, and mostly used a drum machine or a session drummer.

Quorthon also personally paid for the production of Bathory&#x27;s only music video, for the song &quot;One Rode to Asa Bay&quot;, taken from their fifth studio album, &quot;Hammerheart&quot;. The video was shown on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, though Quorthon had not yet seen it at the time he was interviewed for the program.

In 1993 Quorthon set Bathory aside and recorded and released two albums under the name &quot;Quorthon&quot;. The first, called &quot;Album&quot;, was released in 1994. The final two solo releases emerged in 1997, &quot;Purity of Essence&quot; and the EP &quot;When Our Day Is Through&quot;. The albums released under the Quorthon moniker were more rock-oriented than Bathory&#x27;s black/Viking metal style. While working on these albums he found new inspiration to continue composing music for Bathory. Bathory&#x27;s next albums were in a retro-thrash metal style, before he veered towards his Viking metal style once again, especially on the &quot;Nordland&quot; saga.

== Death and tributes ==
On 3 June 2004, Quorthon was found dead in his apartment in Stockholm. The cause of his death was a congenital heart defect. He was 38 years old. The following month, several members of the Norwegian black metal scene gathered to perform Bathory songs in a set titled A Tribute to Quorthon at the Hole in the Sky festival in Bergen, Norway. The lineup included Abbath (Immortal), Apollyon (Aura Noir), Faust and Samoth (Emperor and Zyklon), Gaahl (Gorgoroth), Grutle Kjellson and Ivar Bjørnson (Enslaved), Nocturno Culto (Darkthrone) and Satyr (Satyricon). The black metal supergroup I featuring Abbath, Ice Dale of Enslaved, King ov Hell of Gorgoroth and former-Immortal drummer Armagedda dedicated the song &quot;Far Beyond the Quiet&quot; from their 2006 album &quot;Between Two Worlds&quot; to Quorthon.

<text>Emir Kusturica (, ; born 24 November 1954) is a Serbian film director, screenwriter, actor, film producer and musician. Kusturica has been an active filmmaker since the 1980s.

He has competed at the Cannes Film Festival on five occasions and won the Palme d&#x27;Or twice (for &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot; and &quot;Underground&quot;), as well as the Best Director prize for &quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot;. Kusturica has won a Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for &quot;Arizona Dream&quot;, a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival for &quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot; and a Silver Lion for Best First Work for &quot;Do You Remember Dolly Bell?&quot;. He has also been made a Commander of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Kusturica has been a member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the Republika Srpska since 9 November 2011. Among other accolades, Kusturica became a UNICEF ambassador in 2002 and eight years later he was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in France.

Kusturica has also been recognized for his projects in town-building. Since the mid-2000s, Kusturica&#x27;s primary residence has been in Drvengrad, a town built for his film &quot;Life Is a Miracle&quot;, in the Mokra Gora region of Serbia. He had portions of the historic village reconstructed for the film. He published an autobiography &quot;Smrt je neprovjerena glasina&quot; (&#x27;Death Is an Unverified Rumour&#x27;) in 2010, which was followed by four other books.

== Early life ==
Kusturica was born in Sarajevo, the son of Murat Kusturica, a journalist employed at Sarajevo&#x27;s Secretariat of Information, and Senka (), a court secretary. Emir grew up as the only child of a Muslim secular family in Sarajevo, the capital of PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, then a constituent republic within FPR Yugoslavia. As he writes in 1993, his father&#x27;s mother was &quot;strongly tied to Muslim rites&quot; while his father &quot;did not belong to any cult, he was not religious at all&quot;. Kusturica primarily defined himself as Yugoslavian at least until the year 2000.

A lively youth, Kusturica was by his own admission a borderline delinquent while growing up in the Sarajevo neighbourhood of Gorica. Through his father&#x27;s friendship with the well-known director Hajrudin &quot;Šiba&quot; Krvavac, Kusturica, aged seventeen, got a small part in Krvavac&#x27;s &quot;Walter Defends Sarajevo&quot;, a 1972 partisan film funded by the Yugoslav state.

==Work==
In 1978, Kusturica graduated from the film school (FAMU) at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, which is why he is sometimes considered a part of the &quot;Prague film school&quot;, an informal group of Yugoslav film directors who studied at FAMU and shared similar influences and aesthetics. After graduating from FAMU, Kusturica began directing made-for-TV short films in Yugoslavia.

===1980s===
He made his feature film debut in 1981 with &quot;Do You Remember Dolly Bell?&quot;, a coming-of-age drama that won the prestigious Silver Lion for Best First Work at that year&#x27;s Venice Film Festival. The same year, at age 27, he became a lecturer at the newly established Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo, a job he held until 1988. He was also art director of Open Stage Obala (&quot;Otvorena scena Obala&quot;). 

Kusturica&#x27;s second feature film, &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot; (1985), earned a at Cannes and five Yugoslav movie awards, as well as a nomination for an American Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. In 1989 he earned more accolades for &quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot;, a film about Romani culture and the exploitation of their youth. In 1989 he was a member of the jury at the 16th Moscow International Film Festival.

===1990s===
Kusturica continued to make highly regarded films into the next decade, including his American debut, the absurdist comedy &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; (1993). 

He won the Palme d&#x27;Or for his black comedy epic &quot;Underground&quot; (1995), based upon a scenario of Dušan Kovačević, a noted Serbian playwright. Kusturica and his work have provoked controversy at home and abroad. &quot;Underground&quot; was partly financed by state-owned Yugoslav television. It recounted the history of Yugoslavia from World War II until the conflicts during the 1990s. Bosnian and French critics claimed the film contained pro-Serb propaganda. Sarajevo-born novelist Aleksandar Hemon, who emigrated to the United States before the war, said &quot;Underground&quot; downplayed Serbian atrocities by presenting &quot;the Balkan war as a product of collective, innate, savage madness.&quot; French philosopher and writer Alain Finkielkraut, a supporter of the Croatian president Franjo Tuđman during the 1990s, denounced the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s jury award, saying &quot;it was it was honouring a creator with a thriving imagination&quot; and that the jury &quot;praised a version of the most hackneyed and deceitful Serb propaganda.&quot; It was later revealed that Finkielkraut had not seen the film before writing his criticism. 

French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy made a film criticizing &quot;Underground&quot;. In a discussion with Levy, the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek said:I hope we share another point, which is – to be brutal – hatred of [director] Emir Kusturica. &quot;Underground&quot; is one of the most horrible films that I&#x27;ve seen. What kind of Yugoslav society do you see in Kusturica&#x27;s &quot;Underground&quot;? A society where people fornicate, drink, fight – a kind of eternal orgy.Emir Kusturica taught Film Directing at Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate Film Division.

In 1998, he won the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Silver Lion for Best Direction for &quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot;, a farcical comedy set in a Gypsy (Romani) settlement on the banks of the Danube. The music for the film was composed by the Belgrade-based band No Smoking Orchestra.

===2000s===
In 2001, Kusturica directed &quot;Super 8 Stories&quot;, a documentary road and concert movie about The No Smoking Orchestra, of which he is a band member. He was appointed &quot;President of the Jury&quot; of the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. His film &quot;Maradona by Kusturica&quot;, a documentary on Argentine football star Diego Maradona, was released in Italy in May 2007. It premiered in France during the Cannes Film Festival in 2008. His film &quot;Promise Me This&quot; premiered at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. In June 2007, Kusturica directed the music video to Manu Chao&#x27;s single &quot;Rainin in Paradize&quot;, from the latter&#x27;s &quot;La Radiolina&quot; album.

In 2002 Kusturica became a UNICEF National Ambassador for Serbia.

Since January 2008 he has organized the annual private Küstendorf Film Festival. Its first installment was held at Drvengrad/Küstendorf, a village built for his film &quot;Life Is a Miracle&quot;, from 14 to 21 January 2008. His next film, &quot;Cool Water&quot;, is a comedy set against the background of a Middle East conflict. Filming started in November 2010 in Germany.

===2010s===
Andrej Nikolaidis, a Montenegrin writer and columnist, criticized Kusturica for appearing to agree with Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s propaganda during the Bosnian War. Kusturica sued Nikolaidis and the &quot;Monitor&quot; newspaper for civil damages at the Supreme Court of Montenegro. In the end, Nikolaidis was ordered to pay $6,490 to Kusturica for calling the famed director a &quot;media star of Milosevic&#x27;s war machinery&quot;. The judge ruled that the evidence was not credible enough. In the end Nikolaidis and the paper were fined 12,000 euros for breaking the code of journalism by calling Kusturica &quot;stupid, ugly and corrupt&quot; in the article.

In October 2010, Kusturica withdrew from the jury of Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival after being publicly criticized and accused by Turkish director Semih Kaplanoğlu and Turkey&#x27;s minister of culture Ertuğrul Günay over his alleged remarks and opinions about the Bosnian War. The criticism of Kusturica was started by an organization called the Turkish-Bosnian Cultural Federation as soon as Kusturica was announced as a jury member. Turkish media reported that Kusturica repeatedly downplayed the number of people killed and the rape of Muslim women during the war. The daily newspaper &quot;Milliyet&quot; said Kusturica denied the allegations. Public sentiment in Turkey and in Serbia was such that a couple of days after Kusturica left Turkey, there were unsubstantiated news reports by Serbian tabloids claiming that a mob of Turkish youths in Antalya physically assaulted Swiss actor Michael Neuenschwander (in town to promote his movie &quot;180° – Wenn deine Welt plötzlich Kopf steht&quot;) because they mistook him for Kusturica due to apparent physical resemblances between the two. Later, Neuenschwander&#x27;s press agent said there was no physical assault and that Neuenschwander was verbally abused by a small group. Kusturica later commented on the incident:

At the 64th Cannes Film Festival, held 11–22 May 2011, Kusturica presided over the jury of the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the festival&#x27;s official selection. On 14 May, in Cannes, he was invested with the insignia of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, France&#x27;s highest decoration.

In September 2012, Kusturica accepted an offer to be the head juror of the first Saint Petersburg International Film Festival. During the festival he also performed for the residents and guests of Saint Petersburg with his band The No Smoking Orchestra.

Kusturica was awarded the Order of St. Sava, First Class, for his &quot;selfless care and presentation of the Serbian nation in the world&quot;, on 12 May 2012.

During the last months of 2013, Kusturica started shooting a documentary on the life of Uruguayan president José Mujica, whom he considers &quot;the last hero of politics&quot;. &quot;El Pepe: A Supreme Life&quot; was released in 2018.

=== 2020s ===
Kusturica announced that he will be filming his next project in Moscow. The film will be based on works of Russian writers Dostoyevski, Gogol and Tolstoy. It is titled &quot;Just One More Time&quot;. He was also planning to direct, in 2024, &quot;The Engineer of Easy Walks&quot; to be shot in Sochi.

===Acting===
After numerous film cameo appearances over the years, Kusturica&#x27;s first sizable acting role was in &quot;The Widow of St. Pierre&quot;, a 2000 movie by director Patrice Leconte, as a convict on the French island colony of Saint Pierre.

In 2002, Kusturica appeared as an electric guitar player/security specialist in &quot;The Good Thief&quot;, directed by Neil Jordan.

In the French movie &quot;L&#x27;affaire Farewell&quot; (2009), he played the role of a KGB agent, Colonel Sergei Gregoriev.

In &quot;On the Milky Road&quot; (2016), he played Kosta, a milkman and falconer.

==Musical career==

In mid-1986, thirty-one-year-old Kusturica started playing bass guitar in Zabranjeno Pušenje, a Sarajevan punk/garage rock outfit and part of the New Primitivism movement. Kusturica, an already established and celebrated Palm d&#x27;Or-winning film director, joined the band just after Zabranjeno Pušenje frontman Nele Karajlić had caused a media scandal that led to his legal prosecution on the verbal offence grounds and the band being shadow banned in the Yugoslav media, all of which hurt its commercial prospects and led to three of the six members leaving the group.

Kusturica ended up playing bass on three track from the band&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Pozdrav iz zemlje Safari&quot; and composing one of the songs as well as directing a music video for the track &quot;Manijak&quot; off the album. Though never fully involved in the band&#x27;s day-to-day activities, Kusturica left Zabranjeno Pušenje in 1988 once the filming of &quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot; began.

Kusturica returned to the group in the late 1990s following the &quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot; film and the band&#x27;s name changed to Emir Kusturica &amp; The No Smoking Orchestra. In 1999, the No Smoking Orchestra recorded a new album, &quot;Unza Unza Time&quot;, produced by the Universal record company, as well as a music video, directed by Emir Kusturica. The band has been touring internationally since 1999. The musician and composer Goran Bregović has composed music for three of Kusturica&#x27;s films: &quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot;, &quot;Arizona Dream&quot;, which featured Iggy Pop; and &quot;Underground&quot;.

==Writing==

===&quot;Death is an Unverified Rumour&quot;===
Kusturica&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Death is an Unverified Rumour&quot; (Смрт је непровјерена гласина / &quot;Smrt je neprovjerena glasina&quot;), was published in October 2010 in Belgrade by Novosti. The launch took place on 26 October during the Belgrade Book Fair and was attended by Nele Karajlić, Dušan Kovačević, foreign minister Vuk Jeremić, Vojislav Koštunica, etc. Initially released only in Serbia, Montenegro, and Republika Srpska, the book&#x27;s first printing of 20,000 copies quickly sold out. The second printing of 32,000 copies was out in November and it too sold within weeks. On 8 December, the third printing in 40,000 copies was out and promoted a day later at Belgrade&#x27;s Dom Sindikata. In February 2011, a fourth printing with further 10,000 copies was out and soon the sale of the 100,000th book was announced. The final number of copies sold by the publisher was 114,000.

Translations were published in Italy (translated by Alice Parmeggiani) on 30 March 2011 under the title &quot;Dove sono in questa storia&quot; (&quot;Where am I in this Story&quot;), in France by JC Lattès on 6 April 2011 as &quot;Où suis-je dans cette histoire ?&quot;, and in Germany in September 2011 as &quot;Der Tod ist ein unbestätigtes Gerücht&quot;. In 2012, the book was published in Bulgaria as &quot;Cмъpттa e нeпoтвъpдeн cлуx&quot;, in Greece as &quot;Κι εγώ πού είμαι σ&#x27; αυτή την ιστορία;&quot;, in Romania as &quot;Unde sunt eu în toată povestea asta&quot;, and in Hungary as &quot;Hogy jövök én a képbe?&quot;.

===&quot;Hundred Pains&quot;===
Kusturica&#x27;s second book was a novel, &quot;Hundred Pains&quot; (Сто јада / &quot;Sto jada&quot;), released in Serbia on 24 April 2013 by Novosti a.d. in the initial printing of 35,000 copies. On 6 June, the second printing came out in the circulation of 25,000. The book&#x27;s translated form was released in France in January 2015 by JC Lattès as &quot;Étranger dans le mariage&quot;.

===&quot;Why Did I Need This&quot;===
His third book, a diary titled &quot;Why Did I Need This&quot; (Шта ми ово треба / Šta mi ovo treba) was published in October 2018 and for the first time presented at the Belgrade Book Fair.

=== &quot;Vidiš li da ne vidim&quot; ===
In 2022, Kusturica published a book titled &quot;Vidiš li da ne vidim.&quot; The main protagonists of the book are the author and his friend and Austrian Nobel laureate novelist Peter Handke. 

=== &quot;Kada mrtve duše marširaju&quot; ===
His fifth book, &quot;Kada mrtve duše marširaju&quot; (&quot;When the dead souls march&quot;) was published in 2023.

==Other endeavors==

===Drvengrad===

Drvengrad (meaning &#x27;Wooden Town&#x27;) is a traditional village that Kusturica built for his film &quot;Life Is a Miracle&quot;. It is located in the Zlatibor District near the city of Užice, two hundred kilometers southwest of Serbia&#x27;s capital, Belgrade. It is located near Mokra Gora and Višegrad, best known for Yugoslav Ivo Andrić&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot;.

===&quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot; punk opera===
During 2007, Kusturica and Nele Karajlić prepared a punk opera, &quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot;. The initial idea came five years earlier in 2002 from Kusturica&#x27;s collaborator Marc di Domenico while the support of the Paris Opera director Gerard Mortier got the project rolling. Basing the production on his eponymous 1988 film, Kusturica wrote the libretto by adapting the story of the Gypsy youth from the Balkans relocating to Italy in order to obtain money for his ill sister&#x27;s surgery. The director cast young Serbian folk singers Stevan Anđelković and Milica Todorović in the roles of Perhan and Azra, respectively, while the experienced Karajlić took the role of Ahmed Đida. The music in the original movie had been composed by Goran Bregović; however, since Kusturica and he have not been on speaking terms since the late 1990s, those pieces could not be used. The all-new score was composed by Dejan Sparavalo of the No Smoking Orchestra.

The premiere took place in June 2007, at the Opéra Bastille in Paris, to positive reviews. Following the vast open stage of Bastille, the show was performed in smaller arenas. In March 2008, the production was staged in Paris&#x27; Palais des congrès.

In fall 2010, the production was staged in Belgrade at Sava Center.

On 29 June 2012, the opera was staged in Banja Luka at the City Stadium, for the very first time under the open skies, with 10,000 people in attendance. This was followed with the July staging in Cartagena, Spain, as part of La Mar de Músicas de Cartagena.

Future staging of the punk opera is scheduled for August 2013 in Krasnodar, Russia, during Kubana Festival.

===Küstendorf Film and Music Festival===
Since 2008, Drvengrad hosts the annual Küstendorf Film and Music Festival, which showcases films and music from all around the world as well as a competition programme for student short films. The festival is known for not having a red carpet as well as none of the popular Hollywood festival artifacts.

The reverence Kusturica enjoys in the film circles along with his professional and personal contacts ensure the arrival of top guests from the European and world cinema every year. The festival hosted global stars Johnny Depp and Monica Bellucci along with Nikita Mikhalkov, Gael García Bernal, Abel Ferrara, Kim Ki-duk, Audrey Tautou, etc.

===Andrićgrad===
On 28 June 2011 Kusturica started the construction project of Andrićgrad (also known as &quot;Kamengrad&quot;, meaning &quot;Stone Town&quot;), located in Višegrad, Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was scheduled to be completed by 2014. Andrićgrad is located several kilometers from Kusturica&#x27;s first town Drvengrad, in Serbia. Andrićgrad will be used as a filming location for his new film &quot;Na Drini ćuprija&quot;, based on the book &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot;, by Nobel Prize for Literature laureate Ivo Andrić. His last name is used in the town name Andrićgrad, meaning &quot;Town of Andrić&quot; in Serbian.

==Personal life==
He also has French citizenship. 

Kusturica is married to Maja Mandić; the couple has two children. They live in Drvengrad.

Film director Živojin Pavlović and writer Fyodor Dostoyevski are his main artistic influences.

===Ethnic and religious identity===

On Đurđevdan (St. George&#x27;s Day) in 2005, he was baptised into the Serbian Orthodox Church as Nemanja Kusturica (Немања Кустурица) at the Savina monastery near Herceg Novi, Montenegro. To his critics who considered this the final betrayal of his Bosnian roots, he replied that: 

Despite the aforementioned conflict of religion, Kusturica refused to see himself as either a Bosnian or Serb. Instead, he had continued to insist that he was simply a Yugoslav.

When his mother was on her deathbed he wanted to find out his ancestry and learnt that the origin of the Kusturica family stemmed from two Orthodox Christian branches. An ancestor of his, who helped build the Arslanagić Bridge in the 18th century, hailed from Bileća and the Babić family. According to the studies of geographer Jevto Dedijer (1880–1918) in the Bileća region (1902): the Kusturica family lived in a &quot;čopor&quot; (grouped area, literally &quot;pack&quot;) in the village of Plana; they had eight houses next to the Kozjak family (four houses), northwest across a field from the Avdić family (23 houses). In Granica, there was a family surnamed Kusturica which had left Plana 80 years earlier.

According to the Avdići, their progenitor Avdija Krivokapić, an Islamized Montenegrin, reportedly was honoured by the Sultan for his military service and on the way home to Herzegovina, in Kyustendil, he bought a gypsy and brought him to Plana; this gypsy was, according to them, an ancestor of the Kusturica family. The story, however, as was common, was motivated by traditional disputes of neighbouring families regarding status in the village. According to Savo Pujić, an ancestor was Hajdarbeg Kusturica who was a &quot;čauš&quot; (officer) who lived in Volujak and was said to have been fair, having repurchased Muslim slaves, protected Orthodox clergy and his subject peasants. The name is derived from &quot;kustur&quot;, an Old Slavic word for dull knives, sabres, etc., most often referring to sabres.

===Political views and public positions===
====Serbian issues====
Kusturica was an early supporter of Ante Marković&#x27;s Union of Reform Forces of Yugoslavia. 
At the 2007 parliamentary elections, he gave indirect support to Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica and his center-right Democratic Party of Serbia. In 2007, he also supported the Serbian campaign Solidarity - Kosovo is Serbia, a campaign against the separation of Kosovo.
====Roman Polanski====
In 2009, Kusturica signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski following his arrest in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot;, and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects.&quot;

====Putin and Russia====

Regarding President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, he said in 2012: &quot;If I was English I would be very much against Putin. If I was American I would even fight with him, but if I was Russian I would vote for him&quot;. Kusturica was present at the Kremlin for Putin&#x27;s third inauguration as president in May 2012. He has expressed support for the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea.

On 4 November 2016 he received the Order of Friendship from Vladimir Putin in Moscow. He communicated in Russian at the event.

In April 2022, Kusturica signed a petition calling for Serbia not to impose sanctions on Russia after it invaded Ukraine, with the petition reportedly arguing that alliance between the Russian and Serbian people is the only guarantee for maintaining Serbia&#x27;s territorial integrity.

<text>U.S. Route 77 (US 77) is a major north–south United States Numbered Highway which extends for in the central United States. As of 2005, Its southern terminus is in Brownsville, Texas, at Veteran&#x27;s International Bridge on the Mexican border, where it connects with both Mexican Federal Highway 101 and Mexican Federal Highway 180, and the highway&#x27;s northern terminus is in Sioux City, Iowa, at an interchange with Interstate 29 (I-29), less than north of the Nebraska state line.

It is unsigned in and around Dallas, Texas. Its historic segment through South Dakota and Minnesota was decommissioned with the advent of I-29 but otherwise the route has been spared the decommissioning that has shortened other US Highways. The route has major freeway sections in Oklahoma City including the Broadway Extension connecting suburban Edmond to downtown Oklahoma City.

The section between the Oklahoma–Texas state line and Waco is mostly co-located with I-35 and the I-35E branch through Dallas, and where it is co-located, it is not signed.

The two stretches in Texas that are not co-located are a stretch wholly within the city of Denton and a longer stretch from near Red Oak, to Hillsboro, the reason being that US 77 is a separate road between the two, serving the town of Waxahachie.

As of 2004, US 77 Alternate has a northern terminus in Hallettsville, Texas. It rejoins US 77 at Refugio, Texas. While the main line of US 77 passes through Victoria, Alternate US 77 veers to the west to serve Yoakum and Cuero.

The southern end extends from I-37 near Corpus Christi to Harlingen, where it merges with US 83 and runs through the cities of Harlingen, San Benito and Brownsville to its southern terminus at the United States/Mexico border.

A section of US 77 located in the Giddings, Texas area is known as the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Highway.

Another section of US 77, from I-37 to SH 44 in Nueces County, was redesignated I-69/US 77 in 2011.

As of 2017, US 77 is being co-signed with I-35E as part of the reconstruction co-signed between Denton and I-635.

===Oklahoma===

In Oklahoma, US 77 runs north–south, paralleling I-35, connecting Texas to Kansas and running for through the central part of the state. It passes through many major cities, including Ardmore, Oklahoma City and Norman, Guthrie, and Ponca City. It has a freeway section, the Broadway Extension, connecting Oklahoma City to its northern suburb Edmond, in addition to sections that are co-flagged with I-35 and I-235.

===Kansas===
US 77 runs for in Kansas. Between the US 40 junction and the Cowley County line is designated as a Blue Star Memorial Highway. In Cowley County, it is the Robert B. Docking Memorial Highway. Near Arkansas City it is the Walnut Valley Greenway.

From Nebraska to US 24 and from K-15 to Arkansas City, it is part of the National Highway System.

===Nebraska===
In Nebraska, US 77 is a major north–south artery connecting the capital city of Lincoln with outlying areas to the north and south. The highway is designated as the Homestead Expressway from Beatrice to I-80 at Lincoln. In Lincoln, US 77 becomes a full controlled-access expressway before it overlaps with I-80 for about . North of I-80, US 77 continues as an expressway to Wahoo, where it becomes a two-lane undivided road. It remains a two-lane highway except for two sections near Fremont, which are four-lane divided highways. The expressway north of Fremont is shared with US 275 and Nebraska Highway 91. US 275 and NE 91 separate from US 77 just south of Winslow, and US 77 continues north as a two-lane highway until it meets US 75 at Winnebago. The two highways run together to the junction of I-129 and US 20 at Dakota City, where US 75 breaks off and US 77 continues northward as a divided highway through South Sioux City before exiting the state via the Siouxland Veterans Memorial Bridge.

===Iowa===

US 77 barely enters Iowa. After crossing the Missouri River via the Veteran&#x27;s Bridge at Sioux City, the highway ends at a diamond interchange with I-29. Its total length in Iowa is slightly more than .

==History==

US 77 previously extended north through South Dakota to Ortonville, Minnesota. It followed the current I-29 corridor up to the Toronto, South Dakota area, and then followed current South Dakota Highway 15 north to Milbank, South Dakota. After reaching Milbank, it traveled to the east, concurrently with US 12 to Ortonville, where it ended at an intersection with US 75. The segment between Milbank and Ortonville was decommissioned in 1966; the remaining South Dakota portion along with most of the highway&#x27;s length in Iowa section was removed in October 1981. Portions of the old highway in the Sioux Falls, South Dakota area exist today as South Dakota Highway 115, and further north, as Moody County Road 77 and Brookings County Road 77.

==Future==
US 77 is currently being upgraded between the Mexican border in Brownsville to Victoria, Texas, as I-69E.

<text>George Porteous (April 7, 1903 – February 6, 1978) was the 14th lieutenant governor of Saskatchewan, from 1976 to 1978.

==Early life==
George Porteous was born in Douglas, Lanarkshire, Scotland on 7 April 1903. His family emigrated to Canada in 1910 and he attended secondary school in Saskatoon, going on to the University of Saskatchewan, where he was awarded BA in 1927. He began working for the YMCA as boys’ work secretary in Saskatoon in 1922, later becoming an Army physical education instructor. At the outbreak of World War II he went with the 1st Canadian Division to England as a YMCA Auxiliary Service officer, returning later on to Canada to train others.

==War service==
In 1941 Porteous was posted with the Winnipeg Grenadiers to Hong Kong, to reinforce the British garrison. The regiment arrived just in time to be overwhelmed by invading Japanese forces, and Porteous was to spend a total of 44 months in one of the notorious prisoner of war camps, where he remained until the end of the war. In due course he was decorated as an MBE, Member of the Order of the British Empire, for his outstanding contribution in maintaining prisoner morale while imprisoned.

==Honours==
Porteous returned to Saskatoon after the war and was named executive director of the Saskatoon Community Chest. He was later awarded the Order of Canada in 1974 for dedication to community affairs, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan, the Queen’s representative, on 3 March 1976, thus becoming that Province&#x27;s 14th Lieutenant Governor. He died in office on 6 February 1978.

==Medical research==
An interesting insight into Porteous&#x27; experience is that from 1960 until his death in 1978 Porteous was an enthusiastic advocate of the medical benefits of niacin. Dr. Abram Hoffer had approached him to request that he recommend it to the senior citizens in the social housing development which Porteous administered. Hoffer believed large doses of niacin, up to six grams a day, could retard the development and even reverse senility, as it dilates the blood vessels, thus improving circulation.

Porteous insisted he would not recommend anything to anyone which he had not first tried himself. For six months, he took the six grams a day and then recommended it to the senior citizens without reservation. As he told the Department of Veterans Affairs doctor on his next annual visit (he was on a 100% disability pension) that he had not felt as well since before the war; he could even touch his hands together above his head, not having been able to raise them above his shoulders before the treatment. He discovered that niacin had greatly relieved the severe arthritis and insomnia that had plagued him as a result of his wartime imprisonment and systematic starvation over a four-year period. He supported the use of this vitamin for all Canadian and US ex-prisoners of war suffering from similar symptoms.

<text>Comerica Bank Tower (formerly Momentum Place, Bank One Center and Chase Center) is a 60-story postmodern skyscraper located at 1717 Main Street in the Main Street District in downtown Dallas, Texas. Standing at a structural height of , it is the third tallest skyscraper in the city of Dallas. (If the antennas and spires of Renaissance Tower were excluded, Comerica Bank Tower would be the second tallest.) It is also the sixth tallest building in Texas and the 61st tallest building in the United States. The building was designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, and was completed in 1987. The structure has of office space.

== History ==
Originally known as Momentum Place, the tower was built as the new headquarters of MCorp Bank. The site, which included the Woolf Brothers and Volk Brothers department stores, was one of the busiest blocks in downtown Dallas. Adjacent blocks included the Neiman Marcus Building, Wilson Building, Titche-Goettinger Building and Mercantile National Bank Building. The entire block from Ervay to St. Paul was leveled to make way for the new tower. The original design as proposed by Johnson called for several office buildings, a hotel and a large shopping mall designed in an ornate classical style. MCorp Bank instead desired a more restrained office tower without any retail; the design for the banking hall was also scaled down.

Construction began in 1985 and the tower opened in 1987, with MCorp initially leasing of space after moving from the Mercantile National Bank Building. At time of completion it was the most legally-contested building on the Dallas skyline due to the economic downturn of the late 1980s and the savings and loan scandal. MCorp Bank collapsed shortly after the building&#x27;s opening and the bank was dissolved by Bank One. Developers and financial backers sued over ownership of the tower. Other parties defaulted on loans, and the building went into foreclosure in 1991 and again in 1995, the two largest in city history. Without a lead tenant, the tower was remarketed into fully leasable class AA office space. Due to the economic downturn, this was the last high-rise to be completed in downtown in the 1980s.

In 1997 Crescent Real Estate Equities, in partnership with the financer Trizec Properties, bought the Bank One Center from Cigna and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas for $238 million.

On December 14, 2006, Crescent sold the structure for US$216 million to Los Angeles–based Metropolitan Real Estate Developers.

On March 6, 2007, Comerica announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters to Dallas. In August the company announced that it selected 1717 Main Street in Downtown Dallas and that the tower would be renamed Comerica Bank Tower. The company executives began moving into 1717 Main Street in November 2007.

The firm TM Advertising planned to move into the building on January 2, 2008. It was scheduled to take four floors, with a total of of space. 340 employees were scheduled to move there. The space TM moved into was previously occupied by TXU Energy.

==Design==
* The tower uses a traditional three-sectioned skyscraper form with upper level setbacks. A modern interpretation of the classic barrel vault is used throughout the structure, giving the building an overall art deco style. The setbacks carve a cross shape from the building&#x27;s top section, but sheets of glass descending like a waterfall from the vaults continue the illusion to street level.
* The first five floors contain a massive banking/stock exchange hall with a vaulted ceiling and skylight.
* The building contains a 3 level underground parking garage and is connected to the Elm Street Garage, giving tenants 1,530 parking spaces.
* Comerica Tower is a main hub in the Dallas Pedestrian Network and features several retail spaces below ground.
* The east side of the building features a small plaza with a grid of trees and benches facing the Titche-Goettinger Building.
* The building has been criticized heavily for its poor urban environment at street level. The lack of retail, block-long walls of polished granite and dark glass cause the tower to seem very formidable. The west side entrance plaza, located at one of the busiest corners in downtown Dallas, isolates the building from the street instead of acting like a true public space. At the time of opening, MCorp stated that the stolid exterior was intended. &quot;We wanted a banking building, not an office building,&#x27; says MCorp chairman Gene Bishop. &quot;We didn&#x27;t want the block to be crowded. And we prevailed.&#x27; In 2009 a small restaurant extension was constructed along Main Street in the east plaza, hoping to mitigate some of these problems.

<text>Malacostraca is the second largest of the six classes of pancrustaceans behind insects, containing about 40,000 living species, divided among 16 orders. Its members, the malacostracans, display a great diversity of body forms and include crabs, lobsters, spiny lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill, prawns, isopods, amphipods, mantis shrimp, and many other less familiar animals. They are abundant in all marine environments and have colonised freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are segmented animals, united by a common body plan comprising 20 body segments (rarely 21), and divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen.

==Etymology==
The name Malacostraca is . The word was used by Aristotle, who contrasted them with oysters, in comparison with which their shells are pliable.

It was applied to this taxon by French zoologist Pierre André Latreille in 1802. He was curator of the arthropod collection at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris.

This scientific name is misleading, since the shell is soft only immediately after moulting, and is usually hard.

Malacostracans are sometimes contrasted with entomostracans, a name applied to all crustaceans outside the Malacostraca, and named after the obsolete taxon Entomostraca.

==Description==

The class Malacostraca includes about 40,000 species, and &quot;arguably ... contains a greater diversity of body forms than any other class in the animal kingdom&quot;. Its members are characterised by the presence of three tagmata (specialized groupings of multiple segments) – a five-segmented head, an eight-segmented thorax and an abdomen with six segments and a telson, except in the Leptostraca, which retain the ancestral condition of seven abdominal segments. Malacostracans have abdominal appendages, a fact that differentiates them from all other major crustacean taxa except Remipedia. Each body segment bears a pair of jointed appendages, although these may be lost secondarily.

===Tagmata===
The head bears two pairs of antennae, the first of which is often biramous (branching into two parts) and the second pair bear exopods (outer branches) which are often flattened into antennal scales known as scaphocerites. The mouthparts consist of pairs each of mandibles, maxillules (second pair of mouthparts) and maxillae. Except for fairy shrimps, malacostracans are the only extant arthropods with compound eyes placed on moveable stalks, although in some taxa the eyes are unstalked, reduced or lost.

Up to three thoracic segments may be fused with the head to form a cephalothorax; the associated appendages turn forward and are modified as maxillipeds (accessory mouthparts). A carapace may be absent, present or secondarily lost, and may cover the head, part or all of the thorax and some of the abdomen. It is variable in form and may be fused dorsally with some of the thoracic segments or occasionally be in two parts, hinged dorsally. Typically, each of the thoracic appendages is biramous and the endopods are the better developed of the branches, being used for crawling or grasping. Each endopod consist of seven articulating segments; the coxa, basis, ischium, merus, carpus, propodus and dactylus. In decapods, the claw is formed by the articulation of the dactylus against an outgrowth of the propodus. In some taxa, the exopods are lost and the appendages are uniramous.

There is a clear demarcation between the thorax and the six or seven-segmented abdomen. In most taxa, each abdominal segment except the last carries a pair of biramous pleopods used for swimming, burrowing, gas exchange, creating a current or brooding eggs. The first and second abdominal pleopods may be modified in the male to form gonopods (accessory copulatory appendages). The appendages of the last segment are typically flattened into uropods, which together with the terminal telson, make up the &quot;tail fan&quot;. It is the sudden flexion of this tail fan that provides the thrust for the rapid escape response of these crustaceans and the tail fan is also used in steering. In Leptostraca, the appendages on the telson instead form caudal rami (spine-like protrusions).

===Internal anatomy===
The digestive tract is straight and the foregut consists of a short oesophagus and a two-chambered stomach, the first part of which contains a gizzard-like &quot;gastric mill&quot; for grinding food. The walls of this have chitinous ridges, teeth and calcareous ossicles. The fine particles and soluble material are then moved into the midgut where chemical processing and absorption takes place in one or more pairs of large digestive caeca. The hindgut is concerned with water reclamation and the formation of faeces and the anus is situated at the base of the telson.

Like other crustaceans, malacostracans have an open circulatory system in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it supplies the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing in different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness.

==Ecology==

Malacostracans live in a wide range of marine and freshwater habitats, and three orders have terrestrial members: Amphipoda (Talitridae), Isopoda (Oniscidea, the woodlice) and Decapoda (terrestrial hermit crabs, crabs of the families Ocypodidae, Gecarcinidae, and Grapsidae, and terrestrial crayfish). They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although some, such as the porcelain crabs, are filter feeders, and some, such as mantis shrimps, are carnivores.

==Life cycle==
Most species of malacostracans have distinct sexes (a phenomenon known as gonochorism), although a few species exhibit hermaphroditism. The female genital openings or gonopores are located on the sixth thoracic segment or its appendages, while the male gonopores are on the eighth segment or its appendages, or in a small number of species, on the seventh. The naupliar larval stages are often reduced and take place before hatching, but where they occur, a metamorphosis usually occurs between the larval and the adult forms. Primitive malacostracans have a free-swimming naupliar larval stage. Research suggests the common ancestor of Malacostraca had lost the free-living nauplius larval stage, but re-evolved it again through heterochrony in Dendrobranchiata and Euphausiacea, which both have a lecithotrophic (non-feeding) nauplius stage.

==Mating==
Mating behavior has been studied in the freshwater shrimp &quot;Caridina ensifera&quot;. Multiple paternity, common in the &quot;Malacostrica&quot;, also occurs in &quot;C. ensifera&quot;. Reproductive success of sires was found to correlate inversely with their genetic relatedness to the mother. This finding suggests that sperm competition and/or pre- and post-copulatory female choice occurs. Female choice may increase the fitness of progeny by avoiding inbreeding that can lead to expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations.

==Phylogenetics==

The monophyly of Malacostraca is widely accepted. This is supported by several common morphological traits which are present throughout the group and is confirmed by molecular studies. However, a number of problems make it difficult to determine the relationships between the orders of Malacostraca. These include differences in mutation rates in different lineages, different patterns of evolution being apparent in different sources of data, including convergent evolution, and long branch attraction.

There is less agreement on the status of the subclass Phyllocarida with its single extant order, Leptostraca, depending on whether foliaceous (leaf-like) limbs have a single or multiple origin. Some authors advocate placing Phyllocarida in Phyllopoda, a group used in former classification systems, which would then include branchiopods, cephalocarids and leptostracans. A molecular study by American biologists Trisha Spears and Lawrence Abele concluded that phylogenetic evidence did not support the monophyly of this grouping, and that Phyllocarida should be regarded as a subclass of Malacostraca that had diverged from the main lineage at an early date.

The following cladogram is based on the 2001 phylogenetic analysis of Richter &amp; Scholtz.

===Subclass Phyllocarida===
Leptostraca is the only extant order of Phyllocarida, the other two orders, Archaeostraca and Hoplostraca being extinct. Leptostracans are thought to be the most primitive of the malacostracans and date back to the Cambrian period. They range in length from , most being suspension feeders though some are carnivores or scavengers. They have a two part carapace which encloses the head, the whole thorax and part of the abdomen and are the only malacostracans with seven abdominal segments. Three families are known with several genera and about twenty species. They are found worldwide from the intertidal zone to the deep ocean, all but one species being benthic (living on the seabed).

===Subclass Hoplocarida===

Stomatopoda is the only extant order of Hoplocarida, the other two orders, Aeschronectida and Archaeostomatopoda being extinct. Stomatopodans, commonly known as mantis shrimps, range in length from and are predators. They have a dorso-ventrally flattened body and a shield-like carapace and are armed with powerful, raptorial claws normally carried in a folded position. There are about 300 species, most living in tropical and subtropical seas although some live in temperate areas. They are benthic, mostly hiding in cracks and crevices or living in burrows, some emerging to forage while others are ambush predators.

===Subclass Eumalacostraca===
The Eumalocostraca contains the vast majority of the approximately 40,000 living species of malacostracans and consists of three superorders, Syncarida, Peracarida and Eucarida. Syncaridans are mostly small and found in freshwater and subterranean habitats. Peracaridans are characterised by having a marsupium in which they brood their young. They are found in marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and include Amphipoda, Cumacea, Isopoda and Mysida. Eucarida includes lobsters, crabs, shrimps, prawns and krill.

===Fossil record===
The first malacostracans appeared sometime in the Cambrian, when animals belonging to the Phyllocarida appeared.

==Classification==

The following classification of living malacostracans is based on &quot;An Updated Classification of the Recent Crustacea&quot; (2001) by the American marine biologists Joel W. Martin, curator of crustaceans at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and George E. Davies. Extinct orders have been added to this and are indicated by an obelisk (†).

<doc id="429814" wikidata="Q1095072" url="?curid=429814" title="Large panel system building">
<text>The large panel system building is a building constructed of large, prefabricated concrete slabs. Such buildings are often found in housing development areas. Although large panel system-buildings are often considered to be typical of Eastern Bloc countries in the second half of the 20th century, this prefabricated construction method was also used extensively in Western Europe and elsewhere, particularly in public housing (see tower block).

==History==
Prefabrication was pioneered in the Netherlands following World War I, based on construction methods developed in the United States. The first German use of large panel system-building construction is what is now known as the &quot;Splanemann-Siedlung&quot; in Berlin&#x27;s Lichtenberg district, constructed in 1926–1930. These two- and three-storey apartment houses were assembled of locally cast slabs, inspired by the Dutch &quot;Betondorp&quot; in Watergraafsmeer, a suburb of Amsterdam.

In East Germany, large panel system-building areas have been designated as &quot;Neubaugebiet&quot; (&quot;New development area&quot;). Virtually all new residential buildings since the 1960s were built in this style, as it was a quick and relatively inexpensive way to curb the country&#x27;s severe housing shortage, which had been caused by wartime bombing raids and the large influx of German refugees from further east. At the same time, many buildings from earlier eras had substantial drawbacks, such as coal heat, no hot running water, or bathrooms shared by multiple units. As these buildings fell into disrepair, many of their inhabitants moved into newer large panel system-building housing. Today, large panel system-buildings are often no longer desirable, due in part to both their low thermal efficiency, and their rapid deterioration as a result of their vulnerability to damp ingress and their cheap and quick construction methods, while older housing stock has undergone extensive renovation or been replaced with more modern dwelling units.

There were several common large panel system-building designs. The most common series was the P2, followed by the WBS 70, the WHH GT 18, and Q3A. The designs were flexible and could be built as towers or rows of apartments of various heights. The short sides of building blocks often featured large-scale murals or colourful mosaics. 

Since the entire building had a standard structure, apartment layouts were also standardized. Furniture producers used this to offer prefabricated sets that matched a variety of typical apartment setups. 

There have been projects with low rise &quot;P&quot;lattenbauten&quot;&quot; such as the town of Bernau just north of Berlin. This town had an almost complete historic center of mainly wooden framed buildings within its preserved city walls. Most of these were torn down after 1975 and during the eighties to be replaced by 2–4 storey buildings constructed of prefabricated concrete slabs. To fit in with the medieval church and the almost complete city wall, the houses used rather small design units and decreased in height the farther away they were from the Church and the nearer they came to the city wall. A similar project was the Nikolaiviertel around the historic Nikolai church in Berlin&#x27;s old centre. In the case of the Nikolaiviertel the buildings were made to look more historic.

Large panel system-building apartments were once considered highly desirable in East Germany, largely due to the lack of any other viable alternative. The main alternatives of the time were overcrowded, deteriorating prewar housing, often with wartime damage still visible, due to policies that preferred new construction over repairing the damaged housing stock. Plattenbau suburbs were planned not only for apartment buildings, but included schools, shopping centers, hospitals, restaurants and recreational facilities. Commercial areas were either on the ground floor of high-rise apartment blocks, or in separate structures. Since few citizens owned cars, the developments were planned to include tramways, subways and bus lines. 

Since reunification a combination of decreasing population, renovation of older buildings, and construction of modern alternative housing has led to high vacancy rates, with some estimates placing the number of unoccupied units at around a million. Many large panel system-building apartments were built in giant settlements, often on the edge of cities (such as Marzahn and Hellersdorf in Berlin and Halle-Neustadt), making them inconveniently located.

While some large panel system-building apartments have been being torn down, many are renovated to a modern standard. Especially in bigger cities, these districts are slowly getting more popular again, since they provide affordable apartments and often walkable environments with good public transport systems. 

Berlin-based architect David Chipperfield has suggested that the plain appearance of Plattenbau housing does not promote gentrification, and may be a factor that helps preserve social continuity for local residents and neighborhoods.

In Finland, particularly in northern towns, such as Rovaniemi, Plattenbauten are commonplace. Rovaniemi was nearly completely destroyed during World War II and subsequently rebuilt from scratch, with new concrete panel buildings replacing old wooden houses and becoming a symbol of modernization. Whereas in the rest of Europe large panel system-building are associated with public housing, in Rovaniemi they are favoured by the middle classes on their way to purchasing a bungalow.

<doc id="429816" wikidata="Q222010" url="?curid=429816" title="2C-T-7">
<text>2C-T-7 is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C family. In his book &quot;PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story&quot;, Alexander Shulgin lists the dosage range as 10–30 mg. 2C-T-7 is generally taken orally, and produces psychedelic and entactogenic effects that last 8 to 15 hours. Up until Operation Web Tryp and three deaths, two of which involved the use of other drugs in addition to 2C-T-7, and one which involved an excessive insufflated dose, 2C-T-7 was sold commercially in Dutch and Japanese smartshops and online. It is known on the streets as Blue Mystic or 7th Heaven. There has been little real research done on this chemical other than Shulgin&#x27;s comments in PiHKAL and a few small animal studies mostly aimed at detecting metabolites.

==Pharmacology==
The mechanism that produces the psychedelic and entactogenic effects of 2C-T-7 is most likely to result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by most currently-known hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines. 2C-T-7 has structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to those of 2C-T-2.

==Effects==

2C-T-7 is psychedelic. In &quot;PiHKAL&quot;, Shulgin records that the hallucinations are unique, and that the chemical may cause muscle tension and an altered vocal quality. Shulgin rated it as one of the &quot;magical half-dozen&quot; most important psychedelic phenethylamine compounds, together with Mescaline, 2C-B and 2C-T-2.

==Deaths==
There have been at least three reported deaths related to 2C-T-7 use as of August 2007, mainly at insufflated (snorted) doses of 30 mg or more. In the fall of 2000, a young healthy male died following insufflation of an excessive amount of 2C-T-7. Two additional deaths reported in April 2001 have been linked to 2C-T-7. These two deaths were reported by the DEA as being the result of the co-abuse of 2C-T-7 with MDMA. 

In January 2002, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published an article about 2C-T-7 entitled &quot;The New (legal) Killer Drug&quot;. Although the article suggested that the drug was legal, the legal status of 2C-T-7 was ambiguous at the time due to the United States&#x27; Federal Analogue Act. A detailed response on the website disinfo.com challenged the accuracy of much of the reporting in the aforementioned &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article. 2C-T-7 has since been officially made illegal and declared a schedule 1 substance in the United States.

The Partnership for a Drug-Free America reported in 2006 that 2C-T-7 can be lethal even in small doses; however, they provide no source for their claim and of the three known deaths (as of August 2007) of 2C-T-7 intoxicated individuals, all involved either uncommonly large insufflated doses or the concomitant ingestion of other stimulants such as ephedrine and/or MDMA. 

All of the three aforementioned known deaths of individuals under the influence of 2C-T-7 occurred in those known to be either intoxicated with other stimulants such as ephedrine or MDMA (which are known to be potentially lethal in certain situations or at excessive doses) or after the individual insufflated an amount of 2C-T-7 much greater than necessary to induce the full range of effects typically sought after by users of the drug; for example, the reported 35 mg insufflated dose taken by the individual who died in the fall of 2000. This reported dose was characterized as &quot;excessive&quot; by the US DEA.

==Legal status==
Around the year 2000, 2C-T-7 began to change from an obscure chemical to a drug used at parties and clubs in North America and Europe as it became available through a number of grey-market commercial vendors. This aroused the attention of the authorities, and many countries have since scheduled the chemical.

===Germany===
2C-T-7 is scheduled in Germany. (BTMG)

===Australia===
In Australia, 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 are covered by the country&#x27;s analogue drug laws.

===Canada===
As of October 31, 2016, 2C-T-7 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

===China===
As of October 2015 2C-T-7 is a controlled substance in China.

===The Netherlands===
The Netherlands was the first country in the world to ban 2C-T-7, after being sold in smartshops for a short period. After 2C-T-2 was first banned, 2C-T-7 quickly appeared on the market, but was soon banned as well. 2C-T-7 is a list I drug of the Opium Law.

===Sweden===
Schedule I in Sweden. 2C-T-7 was first classified as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act &quot;Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor&quot; (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of April 1, 1999, under SFS 1999:58 that made it illegal to sell or possess.

===United Kingdom===
In 1999, Alexander Shulgin was sent a copy of a letter from the British Home Office to several of its administrative associates that in effect placed all compounds listed in PiHKAL into Class A.

===United States===
On September 20, 2002, 2C-T-7 was classified as a Schedule I substance in the United States by an emergency ruling by the DEA. On March 18, 2004, the DEA published a Final Rule in the Federal Register permanently placing 2C-T-7 in Schedule I. (69 FR 12794) 

As of April 2024, law enforcement have encountered 2C-T-7 in 16 states, with the highest number of encounters being in Florida. Purchases made over the internet are believed by the DEA to be the most common source by which users of the drug acquire it in the United States, and one laboratory manufacturing the drug was discovered by police in Las Vegas, Nevada.

<text>Frederick Wellington Ruckstull (German: &quot;Friedrich Ruckstuhl&quot;; May 22, 1853 – May 26, 1942) was a French-born American sculptor and art critic.

==Life and career==
Born &quot;Ruckstuhl&quot; in Breitenbach, Alsace, France, his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1855. He worked at a variety of unsatisfying jobs until his early twenties when an art exhibition in St. Louis inspired him to become a sculptor. He studied art locally, visited Paris and then worked for years as a toy store clerk to save enough to study in Paris for three years. In 1885, Ruckstull entered the Académie Julian, and studied under Gustave Boulanger, Camille Lefèvre, Jean Dampt and Antonin Mercié. He considered studying with Auguste Rodin, but claimed to be disgusted with his style.

On returning to U.S. in 1892, Ruckstull opened a studio in New York City. His work &quot;Evening&quot; won the grand medal for sculpture at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. As a result of this national exposure, he was commissioned to make an equestrian statue of Major-General John F. Hartranft for the Pennsylvania State University. In 1893, Ruckstull was appointed to teach modeling and marble carving at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Schools in New York City.

He was also deeply involved with creating Confederate memorial sculpture, forging a sculptural iconography for the Southern ideology of the Lost Cause.

Ruckstull was a founding member of the National Sculpture Society as well as the editor of the conservative magazine &quot;Art World,&quot; where he wrote under the pseudonym Petronius Arbiter, a reference to the &quot;Satyricon&quot;. In the spring of 1917, he wrote a manifesto inveighing against degenerate modernist art, where he attacked both the artworks and the artists, using racist tropes and the quasi-medical language of physiognomy to attack them.

In 1925 he wrote the book &quot;Great Works of Art and What Makes Them Great,&quot; a collection of essays he had published previously, which has recently been reprinted. His sculpture was in the figurative Beaux-Arts style, with its realism, and detailed modeling. He and other prominent sculptors of the era such as Daniel Chester French championed the French style of studio system teaching, art societies, and exhibitions. Following the Armory Show of 1913, he continued to represent the old guard of academic sculpture, a perspective clearly expressed in his book.

Ruckstull married in 1896 and had one son. He died at his home in New York on May 26, 1942, four days after his 89th birthday, and was cremated.

<doc id="429826" wikidata="Q2622118" url="?curid=429826" title="New Acropolis">
<text>New Acropolis (NA; ; OINA; ) is a non-profit organisation originally founded in 1957 by Jorge Ángel Livraga Rizzi in Argentina positioning itself as a school of philosophy. As of 2010, it claimed branches in more than forty countries. As of 2020, its president is Carlos Adelantado Puchal.

==Aims==
New Acropolis describes its founding principles as follows:

According to the organization&#x27;s 2018 assembly resolution, New Acropolis has &quot;three lines of action&quot;: philosophy, culture and volunteering.

== Teachings ==
The organization describes itself as a school of philosophy, which it defines as &quot;a way of life [and] as a means of access to spiritual knowledge and collective and individual realization.&quot; According to the organization&#x27;s webpage, its official introduction program includes the philosophies of Buddhism, Tibet, China, Greece, and Rome among others. The school also offers advanced studies in courses such as psychology, history of philosophy, and symbology. An article published by the organization in &quot;The Parliamentary Review&quot; describes NA as an educational charity promoting the renewal of philosophy in the &quot;classical tradition&quot;.

Scholar of Western esotericism Antoine Faivre asserts that Jorge A. Livraga Rizzi wanted to create an &quot;eclectic and rational approach&quot; to Eastern and Western thought. In addition to the study of ancient sources, New Acropolis also tries to promote modern authors such as CG Jung, Mircea Eliade, Joseph Campbell, Gilbert Durand, Henry Corbin, Paul Ricœur, Dane Rudhyar, Jean Chevalier, Jacob Boehme, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, and Edgar Morin. Some ancient authors it promotes in its literature are Pythagoras and Plato; it draws on Livraga&#x27;s understanding of neoplatonism, Alexandrine hermeticism, renaissance philosophy, eastern philosophy (Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism) as well.

French writer Jean-Pierre Bayard describes New Acropolis as a school of philosophy focused on esotericism and symbolism. It is described by Clifton L. Holland as &quot;a post-theosophical movement that combines elements from many sources: Theosophy, Esoteric thought, alchemy, astrology, and Eastern and Greek philosophy&quot;.

According to Peter B. Clarke, NA teaches a certain esoteric apocalypticism regarding the imminent Age of Aquarius which according to the group &quot;will give rise to great pain and suffering at the outset&quot;. It has also been described as an spiritist group.

==Activities==
The organization reported in 2010 having around 10,000 members around the world in more than forty countries. According to the organization, the governing board of the association is composed of a representative of each of its member associations and it functions through a decentralized financial system.

The organization&#x27;s music competitions attract many participants, such as one in Peru which in 2018 attracted more than 6,000. The organization&#x27;s 2018 commemoration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, which took place in Mumbai, India, was endorsed by right-wing Indian Prime minister Narendra Modi, the Dalai Lama, and Devendra Fadnavis.

New Acropolis has been promoting World Philosophy Day seminars around the world; its India branch was supported in this effort by UNESCO.

In 2020, the Peruvian branch of the organization was awarded the Congressional Diploma of Honor by congresswoman Maria Teresa Cabrera, for its educational work promoting culture, philosophy and volunteering.

==Organization and structure==
According to 1976&#x27;s &quot;Manual del Dirigente&quot; (Leader&#x27;s Handbook) the organization&#x27;s structure is pyramidal and hierarchical. The highest level is the World Command, an office that once belonged to Livraga. Under the World Command is the Guardian of Seals, followed by the Continental Commands, the Central Commands, the National or Federal Councilors, the Unified Zone Commands, and Branch Chiefs in descending order.

The handbook itself expresses in its page 3 that its contents should be kept secret not only from the public but from every non-directive members of the organization. It also establishes that it is valid for the leaders to hide their Acropolitan ideas, beliefs, and concepts when speaking in public or adapt them to the listener&#x27;s wishes, and that most of the symbols, salutes, and customs of the organization should be kept secret as other political movements have used them in the past staining its image in the public eye.

The &quot;Reglamento para miembros&quot; (Members’ bylaws) of the organization establishes a series of norms for the participants including the obligation of at least 12 hours per month of voluntary work (although this can be increased if the person is sanctioned or if they can&#x27;t afford the monthly payments), the prohibition of any kind of critique to the leaders and fellow members &quot;to the former in any sense, to the later in their personal affairs&quot;, the requirement of the students to stand up anytime the teacher enters the room, the mandatory use of tie and jacket for men and skirts for women in all official events, and to refrain from any kind of so-called &quot;immorality&quot;, among others.


==Political ideology==
New Acropolis officially condemns Nazism, racism, and political extremism, but the organization has been accused of supporting neo-fascism and neo-Nazism. Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke stated in 2003 that &quot;the structure, organization, and symbolism of the Nouvelle Acropole [New Acropolis] is clearly indebted to fascist models.&quot; According to Jean-Marie Abgrall, &quot;New Acropolis has borrowed elitist and Aryanist symbols and ideas.&quot;

As stated in 2010 by &quot;Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices&quot; : &quot;The alleged use of paramilitary language, symbols, and forms of organization, along with more recent charges of brainwashing, have led to many criticisms of the New Acropolis in Europe, especially in France, since the mid-1970s.”

The Theosophical Society, of which Livraga was a member before founding New Acropolis, officially denies any links to New Acropolis, saying that Livraga was expelled from the organization due to his connection with &quot;extremism of the ultra right and Nazism&quot;.

==Cult status==
The French Commission on Cults (1995) as well as a Belgian parliamentary commission have, as of 1997, registered it as a cult in their respective countries in an annexed blacklist to their report, along with 171 other associations. On May 27, 2005, the public cult blacklists were abandoned by the French government. However, Serge Blisko, director of the French Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances (MIVILUDES) said to &quot;Vice&quot; magazine in 2014 that &quot;the French government still considers New Acropolis a cult and it remains under surveillance&quot;.

It offers an extensive overview of Nelson&#x27;s term &quot;hypertext&quot; as well as Nelson&#x27;s Project Xanadu. It also includes other theories by Nelson, including &quot;tumblers&quot; for addressing bits in files past and present, &quot;transclusion&quot; as a method for including original work in one&#x27;s own work, and &quot;micropayments&quot; to pay for the use. The format of the book is nonlinear, as the chapters are arranged in such a way that the text can be read out of order.

The preface to the 1993 edition states &quot;&quot;The first edition of &quot;Literary Machines,&quot; done on a typewriter, appeared in April of 1981. We printed it on a Saxon copier that filled the house with a vinegar smell. But it had a beautiful cover, its white title silk-screened on mirrored plastic. Since that time the book has gone through various editions with different-colored covers, printed by various people with various degrees of permission. The main revision took place in 1987, when I added most of the technical material...&quot;

The preface to the second edition, also in 1981, states &quot;This special edition of Literary Machines has been printed by XOC, Inc. under special arrangement with Ted Nelson. Certain changes have been made in the text by XOC, Inc. to reflect the current status of the Xanadu System. These changes are clearly indicated.&quot;&quot;

The first edition of the book, referred to by Nelson as &quot;The Humanist Edition&quot;, featured a silver Mylar cover. Subsequent editions, referred to by Nelson as &quot;The Technical Edition&quot; featured a white soft cover.
