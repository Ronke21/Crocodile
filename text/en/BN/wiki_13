<text>Richard Allen Davis (born June 2, 1954) is an American convicted murderer whose criminal record fueled support for the passage of California&#x27;s &quot;three-strikes law&quot; for repeat offenders and the involuntary civil commitment act for sex offenders and predators. He was convicted in 1996 of first-degree murder with special circumstances (burglary, robbery, kidnapping, and an attempted lewd act upon a child under the age of 14) of 12-year-old Polly Klaas. As of January 2024, Davis remains on California&#x27;s death row in the Adjustment Center at San Quentin State Prison.

==Early life==
=== Childhood ===
Davis was born to Robert Davis and Evelyn Smith in San Francisco, the third of their five children. He has two older brothers, Donald and Ronald, and two younger sisters, Darlene and Patricia (deceased). Davis is of partial Northern Paiute heritage through his maternal grandmother, Norma Wasson Johnny, with whom he and his family lived for a time before his father moved them into a house in La Honda.

His early life was disadvantaged; both parents were violent alcoholics and his mother had once punished Davis and his brothers for smoking by burning their hands on a hot stove. His father had also been described as &quot;unloving and abusive.&quot; His mother had also held his hands to a hot stove for playing with matches when Davis was three. He witnessed many violent domestic disputes between his parents, who separated when Davis was nine, leading his mother to take him and his siblings back to their maternal grandmother. 

The couple divorced when Davis was 11, and the children were given the choice of whom they would like to live with. Davis and his sisters chose their father, while his brothers chose their mother. Donald later joined his father. Robert, a longshoreman, was frequently unable or unwilling to care for his children, so he had them shuttled among family members, hired caretakers, and women he was romantically involved with. Robert was mentally unstable and suffered from hallucinations; he was reported to have taken a gun outside the home and shot at mirages. Robert would also beat Richard, breaking his jaw on one occasion and pushing him through an interior wall on another, and was known to be harsh with the others. Robert remarried twice, and Richard resented both of his stepmothers.

=== Adolescence ===
When Davis was 14, his 10-year-old sister Patricia died of an illness. By the time he entered his teens, Davis was already involved in criminal actions. When he was 12, Davis was placed on probation for burglary and forgery, and burglary again when he was 15. Davis dropped out of school in his sophomore year of high school. Davis told a psychiatrist that stealing relieved whatever &quot;tensions&quot; were building up inside him. At 17, when Davis was in court for a motorcycle theft, a judge told him that he could either go to the California Youth Authority or join the United States Army. Davis chose the latter and received a general discharge after 13 months of service.

On October 12, 1973, Davis went to a party at the home of 18-year-old Marlene Voris. That night, Voris was found dead of a gunshot wound. There were seven suicide notes at the scene. The police concluded that she committed suicide, although friends of Voris believe Davis murdered her. In 1977, he told a psychiatrist that her death had deeply affected him; Davis had heard her voice in his head, and, at times, another woman&#x27;s voice would appear, telling him that she wanted to be assaulted, robbed, or raped. 

A few weeks after Voris&#x27; death, Davis was arrested for attempting to pawn property he had stolen. Davis confessed to a string of burglaries in La Honda and served six months in the county jail. Five weeks after his release, on May 13, 1974, he was arrested for another burglary. Davis was sentenced to six months to 15 years in prison, but he was released on parole after serving a year of his sentence.

Davis has been diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and schizoid personality disorder.

== Murder of Polly Klaas ==

On October 1, 1993, Polly Klaas and two friends were having a slumber party at her home in Petaluma, California. Around 10:30 p.m., an intoxicated Davis entered their bedroom carrying a knife from the Klaas&#x27; kitchen. He told the girls he meant them no harm, and was only there for money. Davis tied both of Klaas&#x27; friends up, pulled pillowcases over their heads, and told them to count to 1,000. Davis then kidnapped Klaas.

An APB (all-points bulletin) with the suspect&#x27;s information was broadcast within 30 minutes of the kidnapping. The broadcast, however, only went out over Sonoma County Sheriff&#x27;s Channel 1.

Within hours of the kidnapping, in a rural area of Santa Rosa, about north of Petaluma, a babysitter on her way home noted a suspicious vehicle stuck in a ditch on her employer&#x27;s private driveway. She phoned the property owner, who decided to leave with her daughter. As she drove down the long driveway to Pythian Road, the owner passed Davis. She called 911 when she got to a service station and two deputies were dispatched on the call. The deputies did not know of the kidnapping or the suspect&#x27;s description, due to Sonoma Valley units being on Channel 3. 

The deputies ran Davis&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license and license plate number, but they came back with no wants or warrants. The deputies tried to convince the property owner to perform a citizen&#x27;s arrest for trespassing. Under California law, a civilian may make an arrest for this type of misdemeanor. The property owner would have had to go to the car with the deputies and say &quot;I arrest you.&quot; The deputies then would have taken Davis into custody. The property owner refused.

The deputies called for a tow truck to get Davis&#x27; car out of the ditch. They searched it thoroughly before the arrival of the tow truck and did not find evidence of anyone else in the car. The only possible violation was an open container of beer, but Davis was not driving at the time of the deputies&#x27; contact and mere possession of an open container was not illegal. Before Davis was allowed to leave, he was instructed to pour out the beer and the deputies filled out an FI (Field Interrogation) card with his information and the FI card was filed.

On November 28, 1993, the property owner was inspecting her property after loggers had partially cleared the area of trees. She discovered items that made her think they may be related to the kidnapping. She called the sheriff&#x27;s department to report her discovery, and deputies and crime scene investigators were dispatched. A torn pair of ballet leggings were found that were later matched by the FBI Crime Laboratory to the other part of the leggings which were taken as evidence on the night of the kidnapping. A review of calls in the area the day of the kidnapping turned up the contact with Davis, who had only been identified because both deputies had filled out and filed the FI card. Once the identity of Davis was revealed, his palm print at the scene of the kidnapping was also traced to him. Authorities had been unable to match the partial print earlier due to the poor quality of the print left.

The Sonoma County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, in cooperation with Petaluma Police and the FBI, launched a search of the property and the Pythian Road area during a heavy rainstorm. The first two days of the search were kept as low-key as possible, since Davis was under surveillance at an Indian rancheria near Ukiah, California. When nothing was found during the initial search and the surveillance of Davis also produced no results, the decision was made to arrest him for the kidnapping of Klaas.

While Davis was being interrogated by Petaluma PD and the FBI, a massive search was launched on Friday, December 3. The Sonoma County Sheriff&#x27;s Department was assisted by over 500 search team members from 24 agencies, coming from as far away as Kern County, California, and Washoe County, Nevada. The mutual aid effort was coordinated by the California State Office of Emergency Services (now known as the California Governor&#x27;s Office of Emergency Services), FBI Crime Scene teams, and numerous other state and federal agencies. The search remains today as one of the largest ever conducted in California.

The search continued through Saturday, December 4. The search effort produced other items of evidence but did not produce any evidence of human remains. The search was planned to continue on Sunday, December 5, but on the evening of December 4, Davis confessed to kidnapping and murdering Klaas and led investigators to her body. He had buried her in a shallow grave just off Highway 101, about a mile south of the city limits of Cloverdale, California. The gravesite is about 20 air miles and about 30 road miles from the search site.

Although Davis admitted to strangling Klaas to death, he refused to give investigators a timeline of the events from October 1. Investigators thought he was fearful that both people who passed him would call the sheriff&#x27;s department. It is believed that Davis killed Klaas before the arrival of deputies and hid her body in the thick brush on the hillside above where his car was stuck. Davis then waited for an undetermined period of time after being escorted back to Highway 12, about 1.5 miles from where his car was stuck, and drove back up to retrieve her body. 

He was reportedly out of breath, sweating profusely, despite it being a cool night, and had twigs and leaves in his hair when contacted by deputies. It is also believed that Davis had chosen the gravesite in advance, since it would not have been discovered by a casual observer. The gravesite area would be directly visible from Highway 101, but not the grave itself. Davis had to drive from the Indian Rancheria in Ukiah once a week to meet with his parole officer and he would have seen any police activity in the area.

==Conviction==
A Santa Clara County jury rendered a death verdict on August 5, 1996. After the verdict was read, Davis stood and made an obscene finger gesture at the courtroom camera with both hands. Later, at his formal sentencing, Davis read a statement during which he claimed that Polly had said to him, &quot;Just don&#x27;t do me like my dad,&quot; right before he killed her. However, no evidence supports that Polly had ever been sexually abused by her father, Marc. An enraged Marc attempted to lunge at Davis but was restrained by the bailiffs, leaving the courtroom to avoid causing further commotion.

Judge Thomas C. Hastings proceeded to formally sentence Davis to death, saying, &quot;Mr. Davis, this is always a traumatic and emotional decision for a judge. You made it very easy today by your conduct.&quot;
In July 2006, Davis was found unconscious in his cell following an opiate overdose, but was resuscitated.

===Appeal===
On June 1, 2009, the California Supreme Court upheld Davis&#x27; death sentence. He had argued that his jailhouse confession was inadmissible because it was given without an attorney present. The court ruled this was justified by the public safety exception to &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;. His lawyer, Phillip Cherney, told reporters he intended to ask for a rehearing and that he would be lodging a habeas corpus appeal with state and federal courts.

Davis remains on California&#x27;s death row in the Adjustment Center at San Quentin State Prison However, his execution has yet to be set in accordance with the moratorium on capital punishment issued by California governor Gavin Newsom.

==Aftermath==
The all-points bulletin was broadcast on the CHP (California Highway Patrol) channel, which only CHP radios could receive. CHP practice changed after the case. The radio system was upgraded and such bulletins are now broadcast on all police channels through a centralized 911 dispatch system.

In the wake of the murder, politicians in California and other U.S. states supported three strikes laws and California&#x27;s Three Strikes act was signed into law on March 8, 1994.

==Media==
Investigation Discovery re-enacted the kidnapping and murder in &quot;Motives &amp; Murder: Cracking the Case: Who Took Polly Klaas?&quot; (Season 4 Episode 4, 10/22/2014).

The A&amp;E television series &quot;American Justice&quot; released the episode &quot;Free to Kill: The Polly Klaas Murder&quot;. The episode exposes the challenges of the penal system to rehabilitate inmates. Davis had been in and out of jail, his convictions ranging from kidnapping to burglary. The episode originally aired October 23, 1996.

The Discovery Channel crime series &quot;The FBI Files&quot;&#x27; first episode&#x27;s topic was the Polly Klaas case. The episode reveals the details of the FBI agents&#x27; collection of evidence and their hunt for the criminal, and originally aired October 20, 1998.

On May 9, 2022, &quot;Crime Junkie&quot; released an episode on Polly Klaas and discussed how the case set a precedent for California&#x27;s Three Strikes law.

ABC aired an episode of &quot;20/20&quot; centered on the Polly Klaas case called &quot;Taken In The Night&quot; on September 22, 2023.

<doc id="429099" wikidata="Q180083" url="?curid=429099" title="Menton">
<text>Menton (; , , written &quot;Menton&quot; in classical norm or &quot;Mentan&quot; in Mistralian norm; ) is a commune in the Alpes-Maritimes department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region on the French Riviera, close to the Italian border. 

Menton has always been a frontier town. Since the end of the 14th century, it has been on the border between the County of Nice, held by the Duke of Savoy, and the Republic of Genoa. It was an exclave of the Principality of Monaco until the disputed French plebiscite of 1860 when it was added to France. It had been always a fashionable tourist centre with grand mansions and gardens. Its temperate Mediterranean climate is especially favourable to the citrus industry, with which it is strongly identified.

==Etymology==
Although the name&#x27;s spelling and pronunciation in French are identical to those for the word that means &quot;chin&quot;, there does not seem to be any link with this French word. According to the French geographer Ernest Nègre, the name &quot;Menton&quot; comes from the Roman name &quot;Mento&quot;. However, it is possible that the name of the city comes from &quot;Mons Ottonis&quot; (reconstituted) from the name of Otton II, the count of Ventimiglia from 1162-1200. In Mentonasc, the city&#x27;s name is &quot;Mentan&quot; (), and in Italian &quot;Mentone&quot; ().

An inhabitant of Menton, &quot;un mentonnais&quot; or &quot;un mentonasque&quot; in French, would be &quot;O mentonasc&quot; in the local dialect.

==History==
The Menton area has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era, and is the site of the original &quot;Grimaldi Man&quot; find of early modern humans, as well as remains of Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons. In Roman times, the Via Julia Augusta, a road connecting Placentia (now Piacenza) with Arelates (now Arles) passed through Menton, running along the Rue Longue in the old town.
The first major settlement occurred during the 11th century CE, when the count of Ventimiglia constructed the &quot;Château de Puypin&quot; (&quot;Podium Pinum&quot;) on the Pépin hill, north and west of the modern town centre. During the 13th century, the seigneury of Puypin fell to the Vento family of Genoa who built a new castle along the Roman road, now the site of the &quot;Vieux-Château&quot; cemetery, providing the core around which the current town grew. Menton was thus incorporated into the Republic of Genoa. The first mention of Menton dates from 21 July 1262, in the peace treaty between Charles of Anjou and Genoa. Its position on the border between the Angevin-ruled Provence and the Republic of Genoa, which at the time claimed Monaco as its western limit, made it a coveted location.
Acquired in 1346 by Charles Grimaldi, Lord of Monaco, Menton was ruled by the princes of Monaco until the French Revolution. Annexed during the Revolution, Menton remained part of France through the First Empire. It belonged to the district of Sanremo in the department of Alpes-Maritimes, which at the time included Monaco and Sanremo.

In 1814, Menton was included in a reconstituted principality of Monaco which, after Napoleon&#x27;s Hundred Days in 1815, became a protectorate of the king of Sardinia. The princes of Monaco were obliged to do homage to the king for Menton, although not for Monaco itself.

In 1848, Menton, along with its neighbour Roquebrune, seceded from Monaco, due at least in part to a tax imposed on lemon exports. They proclaimed the Free Cities of Menton and Roquebrune during the 1848 revolutions related to the Italian Risorgimento. The Free Cities of Menton and Roquebrune hoped to be part of the Italian kingdom of Sardinia. Two years later placed themselves under the protection of the Italian kingdom of Sardinia where they were administered by the House of Savoy for ten years.

The Treaty of Turin concluded on 24 March 1860 between the Kingdom of Mauricio and Napoleon III&#x27;s France called for the annexation of the County of Nice to France, subject to a plebiscite, as a reward for French assistance in Italy&#x27;s war against Austria. The plebiscite, with universal adult male suffrage, was held on 15 and 16 April 1860, and resulted in an overwhelming vote in favour of annexation (833 for versus 54 against in Menton and Roquebrune), The County of Nice was thus annexed to France that June, and Napoleon III paid 4 million francs in compensation to the prince of Monaco, who renounced his rights in perpetuity on 2 February 1861. Nice-born Giuseppe Garibaldi, who promoted the union of the County of Nice to Italy, complained that the plebiscite was not done with &quot;universal vote&quot; and consequently Menton was requested by Italian irredentists.

The publication of &quot;Winter and Spring on the Shores of the Mediterranean&quot; (1861) by the English doctor James Henry Bennett had a profound effect on Menton, making it a destination for sufferers of tuberculosis. By the end of the 19th century, tourism was an important factor in Menton&#x27;s growth. The town was popular with British and Russian aristocrats who built many of the hotels, villas, and palaces which still grace Menton today. Many of these hotels and palaces were pressed into service as hospitals during World War I to allow injured troops to recuperate in a pleasant climate.
Menton was the only sizable settlement captured by Italy during its invasion of France in June 1940. Following the armistice of 22 June 1940, two-thirds of the territory of the commune was annexed by Italy as &quot;terra irredenta&quot;. The annexation lasted until 8 September 1943.

Although officially returned to Vichy France, Menton was in fact occupied by Nazi Germany until its liberation by American and Canadian troops of the First Special Service Force on 8 September 1944.

==Geography==
Menton, nicknamed the &quot;Pearl of France&quot;, is located on the Mediterranean Sea at the Franco-Italian border, just across from the Ligurian town of Ventimiglia. Menton station has rail connections to Paris, Marseille, Cannes, Antibes, Nice and Ventimiglia. The smaller Menton-Garavan station is situated between Menton and Ventimiglia.

The fishing industry was devastated in the 1980s and 1990s due to a combination of overfishing and hypoxia in the bay. At the time, the devastation was erroneously attributed to the dubiously nicknamed &quot;killer algae&quot; &quot;Caulerpa taxifolia&quot; (a non-native Asian tropical green alga first discovered in the Mediterranean Sea adjacent to the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco in 1984) spread throughout the coastal sea floor. Later, sound scientific findings revealed that the seaweed was adept at absorbing pollutants and excess nutrients, actually aiding the recovery of native &quot;Posidonia&quot; sea grass and enhancing local fish populations and overall biodiversity.

===Climate===

Menton has a very mild subtropical microclimate with an average of 316 clear or mostly clear/mostly sunny days per year. Under the Köppen system, Menton features a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;). However, the milder winters (on average) and the warmer nights in summer (on average), compared to the rest of the French Mediterranean coastal area, provide Menton with a particular micro-climate, with significant warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) influences and characteristics, like coastal Southern California. This is usually experienced along the coast between Nice and Menton, toward the Italian border town of Ventimiglia and as far as San Remo). It is favourable to groves of hardy clementines, mandarin oranges, satsuma orange, tangerines, oranges and lemons (SRA 625 is protected Citron de Menton variety), hence one of the town&#x27;s symbols, the lemon. Winter frosts are extremely rare but may occasionally occur at ground level, and snow falls on average once every 10 years. Likewise, summer temperatures are relatively moderate with day temperatures of 28 °C to 32 °C, but rarely rising above 32 °C. 

Menton is sheltered from the west winds by Mont-Agel, and the steep foothills of the Alps, to the north and the north-east, protect the town from freezing winter cold. The winters are therefore very mild and sunny; the thermometer rarely drops below 0°C, and the lowest average temperature is 11.3°C in January. Summers are hot at 25°C on average in July and August but tempered by the sea breeze.

Menton holds the French record for the highest average temperature in July with an average temperature of 24.8°C.

Menton is known for its gardens, including the Jardin Serre de la Madone, the Jardin botanique exotique de Menton (&#x27;Le Val Rahmeh&#x27;), the Fontana Rosa, the Maria Serena garden, and the modernist gardens of Les Colombières. Le Val Rahmeh was established in 1905 by Englishman Sir Percy Radcliffe, the first owner of the gardens, and named for his wife. Villa Fontana Rosa was built in 1922 by Blasco Ibáñez, a Spanish novelist and the gardens of the villa are now open to the public.

* The Institut d&#x27;Etudes politiques de Paris, the leading French university in social and political sciences, also known as Sciences Po, has been hosting a regional Middle East and Mediterranean campus in Menton since 2005.

==Mentonasc language==
The &quot;Mentonasc&quot; dialect is currently spoken by about 10% of the population in Menton, Roquebrune, and the surrounding villages. It is taught within the French educational system, as a variety of Niçard (i.e. Provençal and Occitan). However, in nineteenth-century linguistic descriptions, as well as in contemporary linguistic scholarship, Mentonasc is described as an intermediate between Niçard and the Intemelio dialect of Ligurian. Some scholars insist that Mentonasc is, at its base, a Ligurian dialect, with French influences coming only later.

==Annual town events==
The Fête du Citron (Lemon Festival) takes place every February. The event follows a given theme each decade; past themes include Viva España, Disney, Neverland, and India. The carnival lasts a few days, with different bands passing through Menton&#x27;s streets on foot or on truck trailers. The Casino Gardens in the centre of town are decorated in the theme of the festival, using lemons and oranges to cover the exhibits, and huge temporary statues are built and covered with citrus fruit.

The Casino Gardens are also the location for Menton&#x27;s Christmas Festival.

The Menton Classical Musical Festival is also held every year in the centre of the old town.

Also in Menton, celebrated on the first weekend of July, is the procession and celebration of Saint-Pierre (Sant Pie ), the patron of fishermen. The procession begins in the Basilique Saint-Michel de Menton. Dancers, singers, and musicians in traditional costumes from La Capelina de Menton perform in the basilica. The crowds then head to a dock where boats are filled with people throwing flowers into the port. They then pay tribute to those who have lost their lives at sea. After the boats return, they start celebrating with the traditional fish soup.

==Sport and recreation==
Menton has a football team, Rapid de Menton, who play at the stadium Stade Lucien Rhein. Menton also has a rugby team, Le rugby Club Webb Ellis de Menton.

There is a municipal swimming pool, Piscine Alex Jany.

The town is famous in the cycling world as being the start of the climb of the Col de la Madone de Gorbio (generally shortened to Col de la Madone), which rises to 925 metres and was (in)famously used by Lance Armstrong to train for the Tour de France; many professionals based in neighbouring Monaco still use the climb for training and testing.

Menton was also the location of an international tennis tournament the Riviera Championships that ran from 1902 to 1976. It was hosted by the Menton Lawn Tennis Club. The event was part of the French Riviera circuit tour.

<text>Wangaratta ( ) is a city in the northeast of Victoria, Australia, from Melbourne along the Hume Highway. The city had a population of 29,808 per the 2021 Australian Census.

The city is located at the junction of the Ovens and King rivers, which drain the northwestern slopes of the Victorian Alps. Wangaratta is the administrative centre and the most populous city in the Rural City of Wangaratta local government area.

==History==
The original inhabitants of the area were the &quot;Pallanganmiddang&quot;, &quot;WayWurru&quot;, &quot;Waveroo&quot;.

The first European explorers to pass through the Wangaratta area were Hume and Hovell (1824) who named the Oxley Plains immediately south of Wangaratta. Major Thomas Mitchell during his 1836 expedition made a favourable report of its potential as grazing pasture. The first squatter to arrive was Thomas Rattray in 1838 who built a hut (on the site of the Wangaratta RSL) founding a settlement known as &quot;Ovens Crossing&quot;.

The Post Office in the area opened on 1 February 1843 as Ovens. The Ovens office, and the Kilmore office which opened the same day, were the fifth and sixth to open in the Port Phillip District and the first two inland offices.

The name Wangaratta was given by colonial surveyor Thomas Wedge in 1848 after the &quot;Wangaratta&quot; cattle station, the name of which is believed to have been derived from an indigenous language and meaning &quot;nesting place of cormorants&quot; or &quot;meeting of the waters&quot;. The first land sales occurred shortly afterward and the population at the time was around 200. The first school was established by William Bindall on Chisholm Street with 17 students.

Gold was found nearby at Beechworth in February 1852 and by the end of the year more than 8,000 prospectors rushed the fields of Ovens and Beechworth. Wangaratta became a major service centre to these goldfields. As a result, the first bridge over the Ovens was completed in early 1855. 
A seven-member council incorporated the Borough of Wangaratta on 19 June 1863.

The 1870s saw the settlement establish a number of key infrastructure and services including the first water supply. Wangaratta hospital was opened in 1871 and the fire brigade was established in 1872. The railway to Melbourne was opened on 28 October 1873.

In 1884, the railway was connected through to Sydney.

The population at the turn of the century reached 2,500 and the centre had developed an imposing streetscape of hotels, commercial public and religious buildings.

The Duke of Gloucester visited Wangaratta during his tour of Australia in 1934.

Bruck textile mills was established in 1946, employing over a thousand workers.

Wangaratta was proclaimed a city on April 12, 1959 with a population of 12,000 people. New municipal offices were opened in 1980 which became the headquarters of the Rural City of Wangaratta after the amalgamation of municipalities in 1995.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census of Population, there were 29,808 people in Wangaratta.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.9% of the population. 
* 84.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 1.9%, Italy 1.0% and New Zealand 0.7%. 
* 89.0% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian at 1.4%. 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 41.7%, Catholic 23.6% and Anglican 12.0%.

==Geography and landmarks==
The geographical layout of the city is unusual in that the business district is located at the north-eastern extremity of the urban area, with outlying suburbs extending only to the south and west. The reason for this arrangement is that the area beyond the rivers, to the north and east of the business district, was until the 1990s prone to flooding and so unsuitable for building. Levees were constructed in the 1990s to alleviate the flooding, however development in this area has been slow.

Notable buildings include the Holy Trinity Anglican Cathedral and its Cathedral Close, St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church and the eccentric art déco courthouse.

==Climate==
Since the warmest month mean reaches , Wangaratta would have a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification). Sleet falls occasionally, but settled snowfalls are a rare occurrence.

Rain falls as thunderstorms in the summer, and in winter with cold fronts. Occasional severe heat waves are caused by hot, dry air from the central deserts of Australia moving over the area. Temperatures of and slightly above occur 2–4 times a year on average; however, heatwaves are often succeeded by cold fronts, which cause a significant drop in the temperature. Wangaratta has cool nights and mornings in the summer, due in part to its south-western location exposing it to cold airmasses off the Southern Ocean. The city gets 105.1 clear days annually, which is akin to Sydney and Wollongong, however the distribution is wildly different; Wangaratta being much sunnier from December to March, but the inverse from May to September.

Rainfall averages out to a year, most of which falls in winter with cold frontal showers; however, these can occur at any time of year; and the main form of rainfall in late spring and summer is that from thunderstorms. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 3 January 1990 and again on 7 February 2009 to on 14 June 2006. 
==Governance==

In local government, the Wangaratta region is covered by the Rural City of Wangaratta. The council was created in 1994 as an amalgamation of a number of other municipalities in the region with the council chambers located at the Government Centre in central Wangaratta. The city is represented by seven councillors elected once every four years by postal voting. The mayor is elected from these councillors by their colleagues for a one-year term.

In September 2013 the council was sacked by the state government. Victorian Local Government Minister Jeanette Powell said this was because &quot;Council has failed to provide effective leadership and service for the community&quot;. The council will be replaced by an administrator who will serve until the 2016 local government elections.

In state politics, Wangaratta is located in the Legislative Assembly district of Ovens Valley currently held by the National Party of Australia. Tim McCurdy is the current Member of Parliament for the Ovens Valley district.

In federal politics, Wangaratta is located in a single House of Representatives division—the Division of Indi. The Division of Indi was seen as a safe Liberal Party of Australia seat from 1977 until 2013, when the sitting member, Sophie Mirabella was defeated by independent candidate Cathy McGowan. Dr Helen Haines is currently the federal Member of Parliament for the Division of Indi, making history as the first independent candidate to succeed another independent, namely Cathy McGowan, in Federal Parliament.

==Industry==
There is a considerable wine and gourmet food industry in the nearby Milawa and King Valley region. Other notable industries in the area include Australian Textile Mills formerly Bruck Textiles, Wilson Fabrics that now occupies the old IBM facility, Merriwa Industries and Australian Country Spinners.

Previously multi-national IBM manufactured computers in Wangaratta.

==Culture and sport==

===Sport===

Australian rules football, cricket and Netball are the most popular sports

There are four Australian rules football clubs in Wangaratta.

The Wangaratta Football Club, the Wangaratta Rovers Football Club, both competing in the Ovens and Murray Football League, and the North Wangaratta Football Club, which competes in the Ovens and King Football League. The close proximity of the Rovers and Wangaratta grounds reflects the historical sectarian split in membership of the clubs; Rovers membership being predominantly Catholic and Wangaratta being predominantly Protestant.

The city hosted several games for the 2005 Australian Football International Cup event, with several countries competing in the sport of Australian rules football. The event was played at the City Oval and Showgrounds and set the attendance records for the tournament to date.

Cricket in Wangaratta is organised by the Wangaratta and District Cricket Association. Clubs include City Colts, Wangaratta-Magpies &amp; Rovers United Bruck.

Wangaratta City Football Club is a soccer club based at South Wangaratta Reserve. Founded in 1951, they compete in the Albury Wodonga Football Association.

Wangaratta Knights play rugby league in NRL Victoria. 

Wangaratta has a horse racing club, the Wangaratta Turf Club, which schedules around eleven race meetings a year including the Wangaratta Cup meeting in April.

The Wangaratta Greyhound Racing Club, which held regular meetings at the same venue, has been discontinued. Avian Park is no longer used.

Golfers play at the course of the Wangaratta Golf Club on Yarrawonga Road, or at the course of the Jubilee Golf Club at Wangandary nearby. A nine-hole course is at Boorhaman to the north of Wangaratta.

Between 1953 and 1956, the North Eastern Car Club ran motor racing meetings on the gravel and earth airstrip located on Wangarratta Common, south of the town centre. The circuit ran up and down the airstrip, with a loop at the western end.

The North East Windsport Club regularly sail &quot;Land Yachts&quot; called Blokarts (Blo-karts) at their sailing site at the nearby town of Springhurst, Victoria,

The city is home to the Northeast Bushrangers who play in the Big V basketball league. They play their home games at the Wangaratta YMCA.

===Events===
The main annual event is the Wangaratta New Years Eve event, attracting 10,000 people to the Wangaratta Showgrounds to see fireworks and popular live music. The Outdoor Ball featuring Latin inspired music and international food vendors is another main attraction for the town. Both these events are free to attend and hosted by the Rural City of Wangaratta.

==Education==
Wangaratta has three secondary schools: Galen Catholic College (private), Cathedral College (private) and Wangaratta High School which has three campuses.
Wangaratta has seven primary schools: Our Lady&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Appin Park Primary School, Wangaratta West Primary School, Yarrunga Primary School, St. Bernand&#x27;s Primary School, St. Patrick&#x27;s Primary School, and Wangaratta (Chisolm Street) Primary School

Wangaratta also has its own specialist school for people with disabilities, Wangaratta District Specialist School

The Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE has two Wangaratta campuses. The Docker street campus offers a broad range of courses from business studies to music with a central area containing a cafeteria, library and student services. The Christensens Lane campus on the outskirts of Wangaratta is the home for the National Centre for Equine Education as well as providing courses in horticulture.

In 2015 the Christensens Lane campus moved to a bigger site in Tone Road. And in 2016 Charles Sturt University also added a campus there. The old Christensens Lane campus was then dismantled to make way for a new housing estate.

==Transport==

The Hume Freeway (M31) bypasses the city to the south and east, while the C314 now forms the main road through it (as Murphy Street and Wangaratta Road). The city is located at the junction of several other major roads, the Great Alpine Road (B500), Wangaratta-Yarrawonga Road (C374), Wangaratta-Whitfield Road (C521) and Wangaratta-Kilfeera Road (C523). A city bus service runs every half an hour during the day on weekdays and on Saturday mornings on a route covering Wangaratta&#x27;s West End, the business district, Yarrunga and more recently, Yarrawonga Road.

Rail transport services both passengers and freight. Wangaratta railway station is on the North East railway line, the main railway line between Sydney and Melbourne. It is served by the Albury V/Line rail service thrice-daily as well as the NSW TrainLink XPT service twice-daily in both directions.

Historically, Wangaratta was the busy junction of several railway branch lines including; the broad gauge 5&#x27; 3&quot;Yackandandah railway line, a narrow gauge 2&#x27; 6&quot; Whitfield railway line and the broad gauge 5&#x27; 3&quot; Bright and Beechworth railway line, all of which have since closed. Another short 5&#x27; 3&quot; gauge branch line ran west to a wheat silo located on the north side of the Ovens River at Boorhaman. The current rail line through the town is the 4&#x27; 8&quot; standard gauge rail opened in 1962.

The Murray to the Mountains Rail Trail is a shared cycling and walking track that follows the way of the former Bright railway line. The Hume Freeway runs directly next to Wangaratta.

Wangaratta is also serviced by a small regional airport, Wangaratta Airport.

== Environmental issues ==

=== Land contamination at Wangaratta Clay Target Club ===
In 2016, EPA Victoria received reports that lead shot were being used at the North Wangaratta Recreation Reserve. Several shots were found near the Wangaratta Clay Target Shooting Club in the Reserve. The Rural council tested the area and discovered lead levels to be above healthy conditions. The club closed for six months to remove the contaminated soil which has been stored by the club. A risk mitigation plan has been established to safely manage the soil.
=== Odour pollution at sausage skin manufacturing factory ===
Van Hessen Australia is an Australian sausage skin manufacturer whose factory is situated on Shanley street in Wangaratta and impacted local communities with odour pollution in 2022. More than 160 reports were received in 2 months by EPA Victoria.

The smell was due to Van Hessen&#x27;s private wastewater treatment system which included desludging activities and upset conditions in the wastewater treatment pond. The company exceeded its licence boundary and received several notices from EPA to prevent further smell and maintain stable conditions.

In December 2023, Van Hessen was found guilty in court and was ordered to provide $75,000 to an environmental improvement project in South Wangaratta.

<text>USS &quot;S-26&quot; (SS-131) was an &quot;S&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy. She was lost in a collision with a friendly escort ship at night in late January 1942, when both vessels were operating without navigation lights to avoid detection by enemy forces.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-26&quot;′s keel was laid down on 7 November 1919 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. She launched on 22 August 1922, sponsored by Mrs. Carlos Bean, and commissioned on 15 October 1923.

==Service history==
===1923–1942===
Operating from New London, Connecticut, from 1923 to 1925, &quot;S-26&quot; visited St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands and Trinidad from January to April 1924 and Hawaii from 27 April to 30 May 1925. Cruising from California ports, mainly Mare Island, San Diego, and San Pedro, &quot;S-26&quot; served in the Panama Canal area from March to May 1927, visited Hawaii again during the summers of 1927 to 1928, again served in the Panama Canal area in February 1929, and made visits to Hawaii during the summers of 1929 and 1930.

&quot;S-26&quot; departed San Diego on 1 December 1930 and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 12 December 1930. She then served at Pearl Harbor until 15 October 1938, when she departed to return to New London. She arrived at on 25 March 1939 and entered a period in commission in reserve with a partial crew there on 15 April 1939. She resumed full duty on 1 July 1940. She then performed duty at New London and hydrogen tests at Washington, D.C.

After the United States entered World War II with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor of 7 December 1941, &quot;S-26&quot; departed New London on 10 December 1941 and arrived at Coco Solo, Panama on 19 December 1941. She subsequently conducted her first war patrol in the waters of the Pacific Ocean off Panama, but did not encounter enemy forces.

===Loss===
On the night of 24 January 1942, &quot;S-26&quot; departed the harbor at Balboa, Panama, to begin her second war patrol as part of a division that also included the submarines , , and , under escort by the submarine chaser &quot;PC-460&quot; (later renamed ). All four submarines were on the surface, and all five vessels operated without navigation lights to reduce the chance of detection by enemy forces, with &quot;PC-460&quot; steaming ahead of the leading submarine, &quot;S-21&quot;. After the vessels were at sea in the Gulf of Panama, &quot;PC-460&quot; made a visual signal at 22:10 to the submarines that she intended to make a wide, 180-degree turn to starboard to return to port and that they could proceed with their assigned duties. Only &quot;S-21&quot; received the message. &quot;PC-460&quot; then executed her turn, and shortly thereafter encountered &quot;S-26&quot;, which was running behind &quot;S-21&quot;. The two darkened vessels sighted each other at close range. &quot;PC-460&quot; put her engines full astern, but this caused them to fail. Both vessels took evasive action to avoid a collision, but too late, and &quot;PC-460&quot; rammed &quot;S-26&quot; amidships on her starboard side at 22:23. The impact tore a large hole in &quot;S-26&quot;′s side and caused her to roll, throwing three of the four men on her bridge overboard. &quot;S-26&quot; sank by the bow in less than a minute in of water about west of San Jose Light.

&quot;S-26&quot;′s only survivors were the three men – her commanding officer, executive officer, and a lookout – who went overboard from her bridge. The rest of her crew – three officers and 43 crew members, one of whom also had been on her bridge – were killed. Rescue operations began on the morning of 25 January 1942, with divers making 25 dives to the wreck over the following days in the hope of finding men still alive in &quot;S-26&quot;′s hull, but they found no signs of life. &quot;S-26&quot;′s wreck lies upright on the seabed and is a protected war grave.

<text>Interstate 585 (I-585) is a auxiliary Interstate Highway of I-85 in the US state of South Carolina. It is an orphan auxiliary route to I-85 since 1995 when the Interstate was relocated further north bypassing Spartanburg. In a concurrency with US Highway 176 (US 176) throughout, it spurs south from I-85 Business (I-85 Bus) for a couple of miles before entering Spartanburg.

==Route description==
I-585 is cosigned the entire length with US 176 and it uses US 176&#x27;s exit number system instead of its own. The route is also signed as North Pine Street its entire length. The southern terminus begins at exit 25, where the road continues as US 176/South Carolina Highway 9 (SC 9). I-585 remains concurrent with US 176 starting at exit 25 as it heads northwest. It then comes across a partial interchange with California Avenue at exit 24. Before exit 23, there are two at-grade auxiliary lanes, one on each side which connects Milliken Road on the north side and Graham Road on the south side to the highway. At exit 23, the highway comes across I-85 Bus, forming a parclo interchange, ending just north of it. US 176 continues west to I-85.

==History==
From the highway&#x27;s initial designation until 1995, I-85 followed what is now designated I-85 Bus. In that year, I-85 moved to the north, orphaning I-585 from a direct connection to its parent route, a situation that remained until upgrades to US 176 over the next decade provided a freeway connection between I-85 and I-85 Bus, except for a stoplight at Upper Valley Falls Rd/Fairforest Rd. Additionally, US 176 is connected to I-85 with a stoplight-controlled diamond interchange instead of a freeway-to-freeway interchange. The upgraded segment is cosigned with I-585, although it is not officially part of that route.

==Exit list==
Exit numbers, where present, are based on US 176 mileage.


==Interstate 585 Business==

Interstate 585 Business (I-585 Bus) was a boulevard-grade business route of I-585 along Pine Street, between Whitney Road (US 221) and St. John Street (US 29). It traveled concurrently with US 176 and SC 9. Sometime between 2000 and 2012, the route was removed, with no current state or federal maps listing it nor any physical signage.

<text>The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), established on April 3, 1848, is one of the world&#x27;s oldest futures and options exchanges. On July 12, 2007, the CBOT merged with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to form CME Group. CBOT and three other exchanges (CME, NYMEX, and COMEX) now operate as designated contract markets (DCM) of the CME Group.

==History==

The concerns of U.S. merchants to ensure that there were buyers and sellers for commodities have resulted in forward contracts to sell and buy commodities. Still, credit risk remained a serious problem. The CBOT took shape to provide a centralized location, where buyers and sellers can meet to negotiate and formalize forward contracts. An early 1848 discussion between Thomas Richmond and W. L. Whiting regarding the propriety of creating a board of trade led to the March 13 meeting merchants and businessmen in favor of establishing it and a resulting resolution for such an establishment and a Constitution. A committee then developed bylaws that were adopted on the first Monday of April by 82 charter members of the Board of Trade.

In 1864, the CBOT listed the first ever standardized &quot;exchange traded&quot; forward contracts, which were called futures contracts. In 1919, the Chicago Butter and Egg Board, a spin-off of the CBOT, was reorganized to enable member traders to allow future trading, and its name was changed to Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The Board&#x27;s restrictions on trading after hours on any prices other than those at the Board&#x27;s close gave rise to the 1917 case &quot;Chicago Board of Trade v. United States&quot;, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890&#x27;s language outlawing &quot;every contract ... in restraint of trade&quot; was not to be taken literally, but rather should be interpreted under a &quot;rule of reason.&quot;

On October 19, 2005, the initial public offering (IPO) of 3,191,489 CBOT shares was priced at $54.00 (USD) per share. On its first day of trading the stock closed up +49% at $80.50 (USD) on the NYSE.

In 2007, the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange merged to form the CME Group.

==Chicago Board of Trade Building==

Since 1930, the Chicago Board of Trade has been operating out of 141 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, in a building designed by architects Holabird &amp; Root that is 605 feet (184 m) tall, the tallest in Chicago until the Richard J. Daley Center superseded it in 1965. This Art Deco building incorporates sculptural work by Alvin Meyer and is capped by a 31-foot (9.5 m) tall statue of the Roman goddess Ceres in reference to the exchange&#x27;s heritage as a commodity market. &quot;Ceres&quot; is often claimed to be faceless because its sculptor, John Storrs, believed that the forty-five story building would be sufficiently taller than any other nearby structure and as a result that no one would be able to see the sculpture&#x27;s face anyway. However, this popular rumor was disproved, with the sculptor intending to give the statue an ethereal and god-like look by being faceless.

On May 4, 1977, the Chicago Board of Trade Building was designated a Chicago Landmark. The building is now a National Historic Landmark. Today the Board of Trade Building is closely joined by numerous skyscrapers in the heart of Chicago&#x27;s busy Loop commercial neighborhood.

==Trading platforms==

===The Pit===

The pit is a raised octagonal structure where open-outcry trading takes place. Operating during regular trading hours (RTH), the CBOT trading floor contains many such pits.

The steps up on the outside of the octagon and the steps down on the inside give the pit something of the appearance of an amphitheater, and allow hundreds of traders to see and hear each other during trading hours. The importance of the pit and pit trading is emphasized by the use of a stylized pit as the logo of the CBOT. &quot;The Pit: a story of Chicago&quot; is also the title and subject of a classic novel (1903) by Frank Norris.

Trades are made in the pits by bidding or offering a price and quantity of contracts, depending on the intention to buy (bid) or sell (offer).

This is generally done by using a physical representation of a trader&#x27;s intentions with his hands. If a trader wants to buy ten contracts at a price of eight, for example, in the pit he would yell &quot;8 for 10&quot;, stating price before quantity, and turn his palm inward toward his face, putting his index finger to his forehead denoting ten; if he were to be buying one, he would place his index finger on his chin. If the trader wants to sell five contracts at a price of eight, they would yell &quot;5 at 8&quot;, stating quantity before price, and show one hand with palm facing outward, showing 5 fingers. The combination of hand-signals and vocal representation between the way a trader expresses bids and offers is a protection against misinterpretation by other market participants. For historical purposes, an illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CBOT&#x27;s trading pits has been compiled and published.

With the rise of electronic trading, the importance of the pit has decreased substantially for many contracts, though the pit remains the best place to get complex option spreads filled. In 2015, The Chicago Board of Trade officially eliminated the use of open outcry in all agricultural products in favor of electronic trading, a controversial move that angered some long-time traders.

<doc id="429118" wikidata="Q3241559" url="?curid=429118" title="Linguistics and the Book of Mormon">
<text>According to most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement, the Book of Mormon is a 19th-century translation of a record of ancient inhabitants of the American continent, which was written in a script which the book refers to as &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot;. Mainstream modern linguistic evidence has failed to find any evidence of a language matching this description – or indeed, any evidence of Old World linguistic influences in the New World whatsoever.

Some proponents of the Book of Mormon have published claims of stylistic forms that they think Joseph Smith and his contemporaries were unlikely to have known about, in particular things they think are similar to Egyptian and Hebrew. However, the Book of Mormon includes language that is anachronistic and reflective of its 19th-century and English-language origins consistent with Smith&#x27;s upbringing and life experience, as well as the books and other literature published just preceding the time that the Book of Mormon was published.

==Native American language==


In 1922, LDS Church general authority B. H. Roberts (1857–1933) conducted a review of the research regarding language development and dialects among the Native American peoples; the University of Illinois Press published Roberts&#x27;s study posthumously in 1985 as &quot;Studies of the Book of Mormon&quot;.

Roberts based his discussion on the assumption that the majority of Native Americans descend from the peoples described in the Book of Mormon – as is implied by the hemispheric model of Book of Mormon geography, which was the prevailing view among Mormons at the time. Roberts noted that linguistic evidence among the Native American peoples does not support the Book of Mormon narrative, inasmuch as the diverse language stocks and dialects that exist would not have had enough time to develop from a single language dating from A.D. 400 (the approximate date of the conclusion of the Book of Mormon record). Roberts noted:

The fragmentation of language into many groups in the pre-Colombian Americas is at odds with a hemispherical geography model of the Book of Mormon’s peoples – and indeed with the Book of Mormon’s narrative of agricultural Nephites coming to the Americas and building a large-scale society. In &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;, anthropologist Jared Diamond writes that “had any food-producing Native American peoples succeeded in spreading far with their crops and livestock and rapidly replacing hunter-gatherers over a large area, they would have left legacies of easily recognized language families, as in Eurasia,” which did not occur.

Mainstream investigations hold that there is no known special similarity between Native American languages and ancient Egyptian.

==Linguistic anachronisms==

A variety of linguistic anachronisms exist in it which show that it is the product of nineteenth century American authorship. These anachronisms include words that represent concepts that did not exist in the Americas between 2500 BC and AD 400, or in ancient Israel and Judah.

===&quot;Christ&quot; and &quot;Messiah&quot;===
The words &quot;Christ&quot; and &quot;Messiah&quot; are used several hundred times throughout the Book of Mormon. The first instance of the word &quot;Christ&quot; occurs in parts of the narrative that many Mormons attribute to between 559 and 545 BC. The first instance of the word &quot;Messiah&quot; occurs in the narrative that Mormons believe happened around 600 BC.

&quot;Christ&quot; is the English transliteration of the Greek word (transliterated as &quot;Christós&quot;); it is relatively synonymous with the Hebrew word משיח, pronounced and rendered &quot;Messiah&quot;. Both words have the meaning of &quot;anointed&quot;, and are used in the Bible to refer to &quot;the Anointed One&quot;. In Greek translations of the Old Testament (including the Septuagint), the word &quot;Christ&quot; is used for the Hebrew &quot;Messiah&quot;, and in Hebrew translations of the New Testament, the word &quot;Messiah&quot; is used for the Greek &quot;Christ&quot;. Any passage in the Bible that uses the word &quot;Christ&quot; can substitute the word &quot;Messiah&quot; or &quot;the Messiah&quot; with no change in meaning (e.g., ).

The Book of Mormon uses both terms throughout the book. In the vast majority of cases, it uses the terms in an identical manner as the Bible, where it does not matter which word is used:

Richard Packham argues that the Greek word &quot;Christ&quot; in the Book of Mormon challenges the authenticity of the work since Smith clearly stated that &quot;there was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon.&quot;

===&quot;Church&quot; and &quot;synagogue&quot;===

The word &quot;church&quot; first occurs in 1 Nephi 4:26, where a prophet named Nephi disguises himself as Laban, a prominent man in Jerusalem whom Nephi had slain:

And he [Laban&#x27;s servant], supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me ().

According to the Book of Mormon, this exchange happened in Jerusalem, around 600 BC. The meaning of the word &quot;church&quot; in the Book of Mormon is more comparable to usage in the Bible than Modern English. The concept of a church, meaning &quot;a convocation of believers&quot;, existed among the House of Israel prior to Christianity. For instance, Psalms speaks of praising the Lord &quot;in the congregation of the saints&quot;; the Septuagint contains the Greek word &quot;ecclesia&quot; for &quot;congregation&quot;, which is also translated as &quot;church&quot; in the New Testament.

A similar question regards the word &quot;synagogue&quot;, found in Alma 16:13:

And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews ().

Synagogues did not exist in their modern form before the destruction of the temple and the Babylonian captivity. The oldest known synagogue is located in Delos, Greece, and has been dated to 150 BC.

===Other anachronisms===
Craig L. Blomberg has pointed out several verses in the Book Mormon apparently similar to biblical verses in the King James version of the Bible. According to Blomberg, includes overt references to , , , and were most likely written with their direct influence in mind. Furthermore, Blomberg claims that contains allusions to . Blomberg summarizes his overall position on Book of Mormon anachronisms as follows: &quot;Indeed, the entire Book of Mormon abounds with explicit references to Christ, to his life and ministry and to the three persons of the Godhead long before New Testament times ... even though none of these concepts or terms ever appear in these forms in the Old Testament or any other ancient Jewish literature.&quot;

==Chiasmus==
In 1969, John W. Welch discovered a variety of instances of chiasmus in the Book of Mormon and along with his discovery came attention to the phenomenon. The most commonly cited example of chiasmus in the Book of Mormon is the prophet Alma&#x27;s religious experience, as recorded in . Welch claims that it is unlikely, although not impossible, that Smith knew about chiasmus at the time of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s publication, which implies that chiasmus could only be present in the text if indeed the text is a translation and not a fabrication.

Critics argue that chiasmus is not necessarily evidence of Hebrew origin.

Still others disagree on the extent to which chiasmus occurs in the text. With regard to the Alma chapter 36 chiasmus, one critic alleges that Welch &quot;fashioned a chiasm by selecting elements from repetitious language, creatively labeling elements, ignoring text, pairing unbalanced elements, and even including asymmetrical elements&quot;.

Welch himself offers the following caution regarding a tendency of enthusiastic readers to see chiasmus where it is not actually present:

Some people, of course, have gone overboard with this search, and caution must be employed; otherwise, it is possible to find chiasmus in the telephone book, and the effort becomes meaningless . ... One must be careful in this quest, however, to avoid the problems of the &#x27;hammer syndrome&#x27;—to the person holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. To the person who knows only chiasmus and no other form of literary composition, everything may start looking like a chiasm.

===Occurrence in other LDS scriptures===
Some claim writings in the form of chiasmus can also be found in the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, two other works of scripture in the LDS canon that were dictated by Smith. Critics believe this supports their claim that Smith knew about chiasmus, and that it may have been a characteristic of his personal writing style.

Charles G. Kroupa and Richard C. Shipp are notable for publishing arguments for chiasmus in the Doctrine and Covenants in 1972. In 1975, Shipp affirmed that writings found in the Doctrine and Covenants also had literary patterns similar to chiasmus. In 2004, a study was published by LDS researchers which used statistical analysis to determine the likelihood that a chiastic structure in LDS works appeared by chance as opposed to being created deliberately. The authors concluded “that the likelihood is high that chiastic structure appeared by design in the Pentateuch and in the Book of Mormon. Our estimates do not support such a conclusion for the Doctrine and Covenants [or] the Book of Abraham ... indicating instead that chiasms could have appeared in these works by chance.”

===Other works containing chiasmus===
Chiastic patterns have also been found in the Book of the Law of the Lord, a purported translation of an ancient text by James J. Strang. This book is not considered authentic by the LDS Church, the Community of Christ or any Latter Day Saint sect other than the Strangite church.

Critics point out that the presence of chiasmus in Strang&#x27;s writing as well as in the literature of other cultures implies that the source could be non-Hebrew. Additionally, that the presence of chiasmus is not necessarily indicative of ancient origins.

==Stylometry==
In 1980, researchers at LDS Church-owned Brigham Young University used stylometric techniques they called &quot;wordprint analysis&quot; to examine possible Book of Mormon authorship, through statistical analysis of the occurrence of specific words and phrases. They concluded that none of the Book of Mormon selections they studied resembled writings of any of the suggested nineteenth-century authors, including Joseph Smith. Jerald and Sandra Tanner challenged these findings on various points, most notably questioning the reliability of the data sources used and the methodology of the &quot;wordprint analysis&quot;. Additionally, D. James Croft wrote in &quot;Sunstone&quot; that there were several flaws in the methodology that were vulnerable to criticism.

A later stylometric study was undertaken by Mormon researcher John Hilton and his non-LDS colleagues at Berkeley, who &quot;went to great pains to immunize the methodology from criticism&quot; through the use of control tests. Hilton concluded that, if wordprinting is a valid technique, then this analysis suggests that it is &quot;statistically indefensible&quot; to claim that Smith, Oliver Cowdery, or Solomon Spalding wrote the 30,000 words in the Book of Mormon attributed to Nephi and Alma. 

In a peer-reviewed study using a traditional authorship method and a new pattern-classification technique, several researchers at Stanford University concluded that Sidney Rigdon, Solomon Spalding, and Oliver Cowdery were more likely to have written the book out of a pool of authors that also included Parley P. Pratt and two statistical control authors (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Joel Barlow). Smith was not included in the pool of authors because a set of original works written by Smith alone could not be identified with confidence. However, this study only examined the relative likelihood of the five above-mentioned authors writing the Book of Mormon, not the possibility of an author or authors outside the five-person pool. Another study was published in the same journal that critiqued the methodology used in the earlier study and, using Smith&#x27;s personal writings written in his own handwriting, concluded that stylometric evidence supports neither Smith nor a Spalding–Rigdon authorship.

In a 1991 study for the journal &quot;History and Computing&quot;, non-Mormon David Holmes used a multivariate technique to analyze the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine of the Covenants. He concluded that they were from the same author, Joseph Smith. He noted that “the style of [Smith’s] &#x27;prophetic voice&#x27; as evidenced by the main cluster of the textual samples studied, differs from the style of his personal writings or dictations of a personal nature.”

==Proper names==
Apologists have argued that apparent similarities between proper names found in the Book of Mormon, and names from known ancient civilizations (which presumably Smith would not have known about) can be an argument for the book&#x27;s ancient historicity. Conversely, critics have pointed out the appearance of names in the Book of Mormon which appear to be anachronistic. 

Language specialists discourage the use of small non-random lists of words to compare two separate languages.

===Hebrew names===
Critics have pointed out that many of the names in the Book of Mormon that are not drawn from the King James Bible are found in the local environment around Palmyra, New York, and would have been known to Smith. Richard Packham has pointed out that several Biblical Hebrew names, including &quot;Aaron&quot;, &quot;Ephraim&quot;, and &quot;Levi&quot; are listed as Jaredites in the Book of Ether. He argues that these are anachronisms, since the Jaredites are supposed to have originated from the time of the Tower of Babel, and presumably did not speak Hebrew. In addition, Packham has pointed out that while &quot;Isabel&quot; is derived from the ancient Hebrew Elizabeth, the name Isabel did not exist until 12th century Spain, which he argues is evidence against the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.

===Egyptian names===
In his book &quot;Lehi in the Desert&quot;, Mormon apologist Hugh Nibley compares names found in the Book of Mormon with ancient Egyptian names from Upper Egypt. The comparisons allegedly show that many names in the Book of Mormon are similar to names in a certain region and era of ancient Egypt. 

Smith, in a letter written in 1843 to the Mormon publication &quot;Millennial Star&quot;, wrote that the name &quot;Mormon&quot; came from &quot;the Egyptian Mon, hence with the addition of more, or the contraction, mor, we have the word Mormon, which means, literally, more good.&quot; Benjamin Urrutia suggests the name &quot;Mormon&quot; is derived from Egyptian &quot;mor&quot; (&quot;love&quot;) and &quot;mon&quot; (&quot;firmly established&quot;), rendering &quot;Mormon&quot; as &quot;love is firmly established.&quot; Packham criticizes Smith&#x27;s interpretation, stating that the English word &quot;more&quot; or &quot;mor&quot; is out of place in an Egyptian name.

===Greek names===
In 1843, Smith stated publicly &quot;there was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I... translated the Book of Mormon.&quot; Richard Packham has pointed out that the Book of Mormon contains some Greek and Latin names, some of which are hellenizations of Hebrew names (e.g., &quot;Antipas&quot;, &quot;Archeantus&quot;, &quot;Esrom&quot;, &quot;Ezias&quot;, &quot;Judea&quot;, and &quot;Zenos&quot;) and some of which are Greek or Latin.

<doc id="429122" wikidata="Q1140748" url="?curid=429122" title="Pinctada">
<text>Pinctada is a genus of saltwater oysters, marine bivalve mollusks in the family Pteriidae. These pearl oysters have a strong inner shell layer composed of nacre, also known as &quot;mother of pearl&quot;.

Pearl oysters are not closely related to either the edible oysters of family Ostreidae or the freshwater pearl mussels of the families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae.

&quot;Pinctada margaritifera&quot; and &quot;P. maxima&quot; are used for culturing South Sea and Tahitian pearls. They are cultured widely primarily in the central and eastern Indo-Pacific. A pearl oyster can be seen on the reverse side of the 1,000-peso note of the Philippines.

==Species of commercial value==
All species within the genus produce pearls. Attempts have been made to harvest pearls commercially from many &quot;Pinctada&quot; species. However, the only species that are currently of significant commercial interest are:
* Gulf pearl oyster, &quot;Pinctada radiata&quot;; Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea and throughout the Indo-Pacific as far as Japan and Australia.
* Black-lip oyster, &quot;Pinctada margaritifera&quot;; Persian Gulf and southwestern part of Indian Ocean; Fiji; Tahiti; Myanmar; Baja California; Gulf of Mexico
* Gold-lip oyster, &quot;Pinctada maxima&quot;; Australia; Fiji; Tahiti; 
* White-lip oyster, &quot;Pinctada maxima&quot;; Australia; Fiji; Tahiti; Myanmar; 
* &quot;Pinctada mazatlanica&quot;; Mexico; Panama;
* Akoya pearl oyster, &quot;Pinctada fucata&quot; (also called &quot;P. martensii&quot;), Red Sea; Sri Lanka; Persian Gulf; Indian Ocean; Western Pacific Ocean; Australia; China; Venezuela;
* Shark Bay pearl oyster &quot;Pinctada albina&quot;; Australia

The various species of &quot;Pinctada&quot; produce different maximum sizes and colors of pearls, depending on the size of the species and the natural color of the nacre inside the shell. Black South Sea pearls, or Tahitian pearls come from the black-lip oyster; gold and silver South Sea pearls from the gold-lip and silver-lip oysters; and Akoya cultured pearls from &quot;Pinctada fucata martensii&quot;, the Akoya pearl oyster.

Pearls are also obtained in commercial quantities from some species of the closely related winged oyster genus &quot;Pteria&quot;.

Pearls are also produced from freshwater mussel species unrelated to pearl oysters. These freshwater species include &quot;Hyriopsis cumingii&quot;, &quot;Hyriopsis schlegelii&quot;, and a hybrid of the two species.

At danger from the large demand for pearls, the typical lifespan of a pearl oyster is usually around 3 years to 14 years. &quot;Pinctada maxima&quot; are seeded at about 2 years of age and take 2 years to fully develop a pearl. They can be reseeded up to 3 or 4 times. Akoya pearls are harvested after about 9 to 16 months.

Research carried out by biologist Aldemaro Romero Jr. allowed him to discover that the first animal population depleted by Europeans in the American continent was a pearl oyster species (&quot;Pinctada imbricata&quot;) off the coast of Venezuela. He analyzed historical records and used information about the biology of these and other species to explain its rapid disappearance.

==Species list==
The World Register of Marine Species includes the following species in the genus:

* &quot;Pinctada albina&quot; – Shark Bay pearl oyster
* &quot;Pinctada capensis&quot;
* &quot;Pinctada chemnitzii&quot;
* &quot;Pinctada cumingii&quot;
* &quot;Pinctada fucata&quot; – Akoya pearl oyster – now accepted as &quot;Pinctada fucata martensii &quot; 
* &quot;Pinctada galtsoffi&quot;
* &quot;Pinctada imbricata&quot; – Gulf pearl oyster
* &quot;Pinctada inflata&quot;
* &quot;Pinctada longisquamosa&quot;
* &quot;Pinctada maculata&quot; – pipi pearl oyster
* &quot;Pinctada margaritifera&quot; – Black-lipped oyster
* &quot;Pinctada maxima&quot; – gold-lipped oyster or silver-lipped oyster
* &quot;Pinctada mazatlanica&quot;
* &quot;Pinctada nigra&quot;
* &quot;Pinctada petersii&quot;
* &quot;Pinctada radiata&quot; – Atlantic pearl-oyster – now accepted as &quot;Pinctada radiata&quot; 
* &quot;Pinctada reeveana&quot;
* &quot;Pinctada sugillata&quot;
* &quot;Pinctada vidua&quot;

<text>The 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army. The division was raised in 1908 following the creation of the Territorial Force (TF) as the East Anglian Division. During the First World War the division fought at Gallipoli and in the Middle East. The division was disbanded after the war but reformed in the Territorial Army in 1920. During the Second World War it was a home service division and did not see any combat service abroad and was disbanded in late 1943 but many of its component units went to see service in the Normandy Campaign and North-western Europe from June 1944 to May 1945.

==Formation==
The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. One of the divisions was the East Anglian Division. The infantry of the division was composed of the Essex, East Midland, and Norfolk and Suffolk Brigades. Divisional headquarters was based at Claremont House in Warley, while the infantry brigades were headquartered at Brentwood, Bedford, and Norwich. Its subunits were spread across East Anglia and the East Midlands.

==First World War==
While on annual training, the division was ordered to mobilize on 4 August 1914, concentrating in the vicinity of Brentwood by 10 August. After moving to Chelmsford, Bury St Edmunds, and Norwich on 20 August, the division served on coast defence duty. Three battalions – the 4th Suffolk Regiment, 1st Cambridgeshire, and 1st Hertfordshire – were sent to France between November 1914 and February 1915. They were replaced in April by the 8th Hampshires, 10th Londons, and 11th London. The battalions of the division were reorganized to include four companies (instead of eight) in January 1915, and in May it concentrated near St. Albans, preparing to be sent overseas. Its destination was revealed to be Gallipoli on 8 July. Leaving behind the divisional artillery and most of the train, the division departed St. Albans for Devonport and Liverpool between 20 and 30 July, boarding transports for Mudros, where it began arriving on 6 August.

The 54th (East Anglian) Division landed at Suvla on 10 August in the Gallipoli campaign, as a
part of IX Corps under Lieutenant-General Stopford. By the end of 11 August, ten battalions and the divisional headquarters had landed. As part of the evacuation of the Gallipoli peninsula the division was ordered to re-embark from Gallipoli on 26 November, and returned to Mudros between 3 and 8 December. On 9 December, it included 240 officers and 4,480 other ranks, including reinforcements to bring the division up to strength. It began embarking for Egypt on 13 December, and arrived in Alexandria on 18 December. On the next day, it was concentrated at Sidi Bishr before moving to Mena Camp near Cairo.

As a result of the Senussi uprising, the 161st Brigade was sent into the Western Desert on 28 December 1915. Between 11 and 15 February 1916, the divisional artillery, which had been sent to France in November 1915 and attached to the 33rd Division, rejoined the division at Mena. The 161st Brigade returned to the division on 5 March, without the 4th Essex, which returned on 23 March. The division took over the southern section of the Suez Canal defences on 2 April, as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, commanded by General Sir Archibald Murray.
Then in the Sinai and Palestine campaign, during the First Battle of Gaza, on 26 March 1917, the 161st Brigade and divisional artillery were in reserve while the 53rd (Welsh) Division carried out the main attack. These reserves were committed as the battle progressed resulting in the British gaining a foothold in the Turkish defences but the British commander called off the attack as night fell. In the Second Battle of Gaza, the 1/4th and 1/5th battalions of the Norfolk Regiment sustained 75 per cent casualties (about 1,200 men). It took part in the successful Third Battle of Gaza as part of XXI Corps led by Lieutenant General Sir Edward Bulfin, and by the end of 1917 General Sir Edmund Allenby&#x27;s forces had taken Jerusalem. The division fought in the Battle of Jaffa on 21 and 22 December.

The 162nd Brigade participated in the Fight at Ras el&#x27;Ain during the Battle of Tell &#x27;Asur on 12 March 1918. The division fought in the attack at Berukin on 9 and 10 April/ In September 1918 the division took part in the Battle of Sharon between 19 and 23 September. After the end of the battle, the division concentrated at Hableh on 24 September and was ordered to move to Haifa three days later. It began advancing to Haifa on 28 September through Atlit, and finished concentrating there on 4 October, where it improved communications. The division was ordered to begin the advance to Beirut on 20 October, which was conducted by brigade group in daylong intervals. The advance began three days later, through Acre, Naqoura, Tyre, and Sidon. The division reached Beirut between 31 October and 5 November, as the war with the Ottoman Empire ended on 31 October.

The division moved back by sea to El Qantara from 28 November, beginning with the 163rd Brigade, and then moved to Helmie, where it concentrated on 7 December without its artillery and train. The divisional artillery and train arrived via El Qantara by 14 December, except for the CCLXXII Brigade, which marched from Beirut to Tulkarm before entraining for Helmie on 9 December. The demobilization of the division began on 6 January 1919 with the disbandment of the three brigade trench mortar brigades. The division personnel filled the time with educational courses in January as they were gradually demobilized. By 22 May only six battalions remained, and on 29 May the 77th Brigade joined the division and was renumbered as the 161st Brigade. The CII Brigade joined and temporarily became the division artillery on 1 June. The Territorial units were reduced to cadre strength and the war-time units were disbanded, with the division ceasing to exist in Egypt on 30 September 1919.

==Between the wars==
The division was disbanded after the Great War when the whole of the Territorial Force was disbanded. However, it was reformed in 1920 as the Territorial Army (TA) and the division was reconstituted with Eastern Command, initially with a similar composition to before the First World War but, over the next few years, with a much different composition.

===Buildup to the Second World War===

Throughout the 1930s, tensions built between Germany and the United Kingdom as well as its allies. During late 1937 and throughout 1938, German demands for the annexation of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Sudetenland led to an international crisis. In an attempt to avoid war, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met the German Chancellor Adolf Hitler in September and brokered the Munich Agreement. The agreement averted immediate war and allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland. Chamberlain had intended the agreement to lead to further peaceful resolution of issues, but relations between both countries soon deteriorated. On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying the remnants of the Czech state.

In response, on 29 March, the British Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha announced plans to increase the Territorial Army from 130,000 men to 340,000 and in so doing double the number of territorial divisions. The plan of action was for the existing units to recruit over their allowed establishments (aided by an increase in pay for territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion that had been a major hindrance to recruiting during the preceding years, the construction of better quality barracks, and an increase in supper-time rations) and then form Second Line divisions from small cadres that could be built upon. As a result, the 54th was to provide cadres to form a Second Line duplicate unit, which would become the 18th Infantry Division following the start of the war. In April, limited conscription was introduced. At that time 34,500 militiamen, all aged 20, were conscripted into the regular army, initially to be trained for six months before being deployed to the forming second line units. Despite the intention for the army to grow in size, the programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on the expansion and duplication process and issues regarding the lack of facilities, equipment and instructors.

==Second World War==
Upon the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the 54th Division, commanded by Major-General John Priestman, a Regular Army officer, and serving under Eastern Command, was mobilised for full-time war service. Comprising still the 161st, 162nd and 163rd Infantry Brigades and divisional troops, the division absorbed hundreds of conscripts and spent the first few months of the war, after guarding various designated &#x27;vulnerable points&#x27;, training for eventual overseas service.

The division remained in the United Kingdom as a local defence formation, being downgraded to a Lower Establishment in January 1942. The division was disbanded and broken up on 14 December 1943. Its component units would take part in the Normandy Campaign as support units, with the HQ Royal Artillery becoming HQ 8th Army Group Royal Artillery and HQ Royal Engineers becoming HQ Royal Engineers for the 6th Airborne Division. The divisional HQ was redesignated HQ Lines of Communication (54th Division) for the 21st Army Group. The division was not reformed in the post-war Territorial Army in 1947 but the 161st and 162nd Infantry Brigades both survived until disbandment in the 1960s.

==Postwar==
The formation became known as East Anglian District when the Territorial Army was reformed on 1 January 1947. In 1961 it became a district headquarters as 54th (East Anglian) Division/District, and it was disbanded on the reduction of the TA into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve on 1 April 1967, when many individual TA units lost their identities. The district headquarters itself formed the core of the structure for the creation of Eastern District under HQ UK Land Forces in 1972.

<text>The title of Earl of Northumberland has been created several times in the Peerage of England and of Great Britain, succeeding the title Earl of Northumbria. Its most famous holders are the House of Percy (&quot;alias&quot; Perci), who were the most powerful noble family in Northern England for much of the Middle Ages. The heirs of the Percys, via a female line, were ultimately made Duke of Northumberland in 1766, and continue to hold the earldom as a subsidiary title.

==History==
===Percy family===
&lt;section begin=Percy Family/&gt;
William de Percy, 1st Baron Percy, was in the train of William I. After arriving in England following the Harrying of the North (1069–70), he was bestowed modest estates in Yorkshire by Hugh d&#x27;Avranches. However, by the reign of Henry II the family was represented by only an heiress, Agnes de Percy (died 1203) following the death of the third feudal baron. As her dowry contained the manor of Topcliffe in Yorkshire, Adeliza of Louvain, the widowed and remarried second wife of Henry I, arranged the marriage of Agnes with her own young half-brother, Joscelin of Louvain. After their wedding, the nobleman from the Duchy of Brabant in the Holy Roman Empire settled in England. He adopted the surname Percy and his descendants were later created Earls of Northumberland. The Percys&#x27; line would go on to play a large role in the history of both England and Scotland. As nearly every Percy was a Warden of the Marches, Scottish affairs were often of more concern than those in England.

====1309: 1st Baron Percy====
In 1309, Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy purchased Alnwick Castle from Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham. The castle had been founded in the late 11th century by Ivo de Vesci, a nobleman from Vassy or Vichy. A descendant of Ivo de Vesci, John de Vesci, succeeded to his father&#x27;s titles and estates upon his father&#x27;s death in Gascony in 1253. These included the barony of Alnwick and a large property in Northumberland and considerable estates in Yorkshire, including Malton. Due to being under age, King Henry III of England conferred the wardship of John&#x27;s estates to a foreign kinsman, which caused great offence to the de Vesci family. The family&#x27;s property and estates had been put into the guardianship of Bek, who sold them to the Percys. From this time, the fortunes of the Percys, although they still held their Yorkshire lands and titles, were linked permanently with Alnwick and its castle.

====1316: 2nd Baron Percy====
Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy, who was granted the lands of Patrick IV, Earl of March, in Northumberland, by Edward II in 1316, began to improve the size and defences of the castle. He was appointed to Edward III&#x27;s Council in 1327 and was given the manor and castle of Skipton. Was granted, by Edward III, the castle and barony of Warkworth in 1328. He was at the siege of Dunbar and the Battle of Halidon Hill and was subsequently appointed constable of Berwick-upon-Tweed. In 1346, Henry commanded the right wing of the English Army which defeated a larger Scottish force at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross near Durham. His son, Henry de Percy, 3rd Baron Percy married Mary of Lancaster, an aunt of John of Gaunt&#x27;s wife Blanche of Lancaster.&lt;section end=Percy Family /&gt;

===1377 creation===
&lt;section begin=1377/&gt;

In 1377, the next Henry Percy was created Earl of Northumberland, a title given to him after the coronation of Richard II. He supported the takeover by Henry IV but subsequently rebelled against the new king, leading to his estates being forfeited under attainder. In his rebellion he was aided by his son, the most famous Percy of all, Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot;, who was slain at Shrewsbury in the lifetime of his father. Both the 1st Earl of Northumberland as well as his son Hotspur play a chief role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot;.&lt;section end=1377/&gt;

===1416 creation===
&lt;section begin=1416/&gt;Henry V restored Hotspur&#x27;s son, the second Earl, to his family honours, and the Percys were staunch Lancastrians during the Wars of the Roses which followed, the third Earl and three of his brothers losing their lives in the cause.

The fourth Earl was involved in the political manoeuvrings of the last Yorkist kings Edward IV and Richard III. Through either indecision or treachery he did not respond in a timely manner at the Battle of Bosworth Field, and thus helped cause his ally Richard III&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Henry Tudor (who became Henry VII). In 1489, he was pulled from his horse and murdered by some of his tenants.

The fifth Earl displayed magnificence in his tastes, and being one of the richest magnates of his day, kept a very large household establishment.

Henry Percy, the sixth Earl of Northumberland, loved Anne Boleyn, and was her accepted suitor before Henry VIII married her. He married later to Mary Talbot, the daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury, but as he died without a son, his nephew Thomas Percy became the seventh Earl.

Thereafter, a succession of plots and counterplots—the Rising of the North, the plots to liberate Mary Queen of Scots, and the Gunpowder Plot – each claimed a Percy among their adherents. On this account the eighth and ninth Earls spent many years in the Tower, but the tenth Earl, Algernon, fought against King Charles in the Civil War. The male line of the Percy-Louvain house ended with Josceline, the eleventh Earl. The heiress to the vast Percy estates married the Duke of Somerset; and her granddaughter married a Yorkshire knight, Sir Hugh Smithson, who in 1766 was created the first Duke of Northumberland and Earl Percy, and it is their descendants who now represent the famous old house.

The current duke lives at Alnwick Castle and Syon House, just outside London.&lt;section end=1416/&gt;

==List of titleholders==

===Early earls===
===Earls of Northumberland, first creation (1377)===
* Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland (1341–1408) (attainted 1405)
** Sir Henry Percy, also called Harry Hotspur KG (c. 1365–1403) &quot;heir apparent&quot;

===Earls of Northumberland, second creation (1416)===
* Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland (1394–1455), grandson of Henry (1341–1408) and son of &quot;Hotspur&quot;
* Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland (1421–1461), (forfeit 1461), son of Henry 2nd Earl

===Earl of Northumberland, third creation (1464)===
* John Neville, Earl of Northumberland, (1st Marquess of Montagu) (1431–1471), (1464–1470 released)

===Earls of Northumberland (1416, cont.)===
* Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland (1449–1489) (restored 1470–1473), son of Henry 3rd
* Henry Algernon Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland (1478–1527), son of Henry 4th
* Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland (1502–1537), son of Henry 5th, died without children
* Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland (1528–1572) (father attainted, restored 1557), grandson of Henry 5th
* Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland (1532–1585), also grandson of Henry 5th, younger brother of Thomas
* Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland (1564–1632), son of Henry 8th
* Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland (1602–1668), son of Henry 9th
* Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644–1670), son of Algernon, died leaving only one daughter, so the Earldom became extinct

Various references use at least three different sequences of numbers for the Earls; the ones shown here are those used in the individual articles on the 12 Earls. The major difference arises from the question of whether Henry (1394–1455) was 1st as a new creation or 2nd as a restoration of the rights of his grandfather, Henry (1341–1408). Additionally, there is some debate about whether the 7th Earl was restored to the previous creation or was given a new creation.

===Earls of Northumberland, fourth creation (1674)===
* George FitzRoy, Earl of Northumberland (1665–1716) (became Duke of Northumberland in 1683; extinct)

===Earls of Northumberland, fifth creation (1749)===
* Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset (1684–1750), female-line grandson and heir of the 11th Earl of the 1416 creation
** Elizabeth Percy &quot;née&quot; Seymour (1716–1776), only daughter of the 1st Earl, married Sir Hugh Smithson
* Hugh Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland (1714–1786), changed his name to Percy when he inherited the Earldom of Northumberland from his father-in-law by special remainder; became Duke of Northumberland in 1766
The line continues with the Dukes of Northumberland (third creation)

<text>Dream On is an American sitcom television series created by Marta Kauffman and David Crane. It follows the family life, romantic life, and career of Martin Tupper, a divorced New York City book editor played by Brian Benben. The show distinctively interjected clips from older black-and-white television series to punctuate Martin&#x27;s feelings or thoughts. It ran for six seasons on HBO between July 8, 1990, and March 27, 1996.

==Premise==
The show centered on Martin Tupper&#x27;s life in an apartment in New York City with his young son, and relating to his ex-wife, while trying to date other women and succeed as an editor for a small book publisher with Toby, his brassy secretary. Judith, his ex-wife, went on to marry Dr. Richard Stone – the never-seen (until the end of the series), most impossibly successful man on the planet (astronaut, brain surgeon, the fifth Beatle and consultant to the Pope); despite Martin&#x27;s undying love for Judith, he could never compete with the legendary Dr. Stone.

The opening indicates Martin&#x27;s mother parked him in front of the TV and he then grew up engrossed in it. It briefly shows a babysitter making out with a boyfriend behind young Martin, hence the association of sex with his memories. The show was notable for its frequent use of clips from old movies and TV shows to express Martin&#x27;s inner life and feelings, which lent it much of its quirky appeal, reminding viewers about the effect of television on their consciousness. The show was also significant for being one of the first American sitcoms to use uncensored profanity and nudity.

==Cast==
* Brian Benben as Martin Tupper, a book editor for a smaller publishing house that usually specializes in romance novels and other less prestigious literary fare. Having practically been raised by television in the 1950s, his thoughts are shown to the viewer through clips of classic black and white programming. He struggles to find love (or something like it) while sorting out the feelings he still has for his ex-wife, Judith.
* Wendie Malick as Judith Tupper Stone, Martin&#x27;s ex-wife who has since remarried the &quot;literal&quot; perfect man, Dr. Richard Stone.
* Chris Demetral as Jeremy Tupper, Martin&#x27;s teenaged son. 
* Dorien Wilson (seasons 2–6) and Jeff Joseph (season 1) as Eddie Charles, a talk show host and Martin&#x27;s best friend.
* Denny Dillon as Toby Pedalbee, Martin&#x27;s secretary/assistant
* Michael McKean as Gibby Fiske, Martin&#x27;s boss (recurring during seasons 2–6)
* Renée Taylor as Martin&#x27;s mother, Doris Tupper (occasional during seasons 3–5)

==Production==
The show was created by Marta Kauffman and David Crane, who also served as producers. &quot;Dream On&quot; was executive produced by Kevin Bright and John Landis. Landis also directed several episodes of the series.

==Episodes==

==Broadcast==
Dream On first aired on July 8, 1990, on HBO, and was cancelled by HBO in March 1996. A bowdlerized version was later made available in syndication.

===Syndication===
The series aired in syndication on Comedy Central from 1996 to 1999, with language and nudity edited for broadcast.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Time&quot; magazine called the show &quot;engaging&quot;, noting that its use of old clips was &quot;a clever gimmick [that] perks up familiar material&quot; and later called the second season of the &quot;decidedly adult sitcom...better than ever.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; had mixed opinions about the show. In their first-season review, John J. O&#x27;Connor said &quot;Dream On&quot; was not &quot;different from ordinary network fare...except for, as might be expected, the more freewheeling language and treatments of sex&quot;; by the season&#x27;s third episode, the show&#x27;s protagonist is &quot;already becoming just another nice bachelor father, not all that different from the one John Forsythe played on television several decades ago.&quot; About a year later, O&#x27;Connor said, while the show &quot;has its weak spots, most notably in a pointless tendency to be smarmy&quot; with &quot;clips... that are sometimes less witty than painfully obvious. But &quot;Dream On&quot; takes unusual chances and has a habit of turning out to be refreshingly original.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
==Home media==
Seasons one and two were released on DVD for both regions 1 and 2; seasons three through six have not been released.

<text>Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, Lord of Roslin () was a Scottish nobleman. Sinclair held the title Earl of Orkney (which refers to Norðreyjar rather than just the islands of Orkney) and was Lord High Admiral of Scotland under the King of Scotland. He was sometimes identified by another spelling of his surname, &quot;St. Clair&quot;. He was the grandfather of William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness, the builder of Rosslyn Chapel. He is best known today because of a modern legend that he took part in explorations of Greenland and North America almost 100 years before Christopher Columbus. William Thomson, in his book &quot;The New History of Orkney&quot;, wrote: &quot;It has been Earl Henry&#x27;s singular fate to enjoy an ever-expanding posthumous reputation which has very little to do with anything he achieved in his lifetime.&quot;

==Biography==

Henry Sinclair was the son and heir of William Sinclair, Lord of Roslin, and his wife Isabella (Isobel) of Strathearn. She was a daughter of Maol Ísa, Jarl of Orkney. Henry Sinclair&#x27;s maternal grandfather had been deprived of much of his lands (the earldom of Strathearn being completely lost to the King of Scots).

Sometime after 13 September 1358, Henry&#x27;s father died, at which point Henry Sinclair succeeded as the 9th Baron of Roslin, Pentland and Cousland, a group of minor properties in Lothian.

Although the Norwegian Jarldom of Orkney was not an inheritable position, successive appointments had operated as if it had been. After a vacancy lasting 18 years, three cousins – Alexander de L&#x27;Arde, Lord of Caithness; Malise Sparre, Lord of Skaldale; and Henry Sinclair – were rivals for the succession. Initially trialing de L&#x27;Arde as &quot;Captain of Orkney&quot;, King Haakon VI of Norway was quickly disappointed in de L&#x27;Arde&#x27;s behaviour, and sacked him.

On 2 August 1379, at Marstrand, near Tønsberg, Norway, Haakon chose Sinclair over Sparre, investing Sinclair with the Jarldom or Earldom in the Peerage of Scotland. In return Henry pledged to pay a fee of 1000 nobles before St. Martin&#x27;s Day (11 November), and, when called upon, serve the king on Orkney or elsewhere with 100 fully armed men for 3 months. It is unknown if Haakon VI ever attempted to call upon the troops pledged by Henry or if any of the fee was actually paid.

As security for upholding the agreement the new jarl left hostages behind when he departed Norway for Orkney. Shortly before his death in summer 1380, the king permitted the hostages to return home. In 1389, Sinclair attended the hailing of King Eric in Norway, pledging his oath of fealty. Historians have speculated that in 1391 Sinclair and his troops slew Malise Sparre near Scalloway, Tingwall parish, Shetland.

Sinclair is later described as an &quot;admiral of the seas&quot; in the &quot;Genealogies of the Saintclaires of Roslin&quot; by Richard Augustine Hay. This refers to his position as the Lord High Admiral of Scotland while in service to the King of Scotland. It is a title he is said to have inherited from his father William Sinclair in 1358 but it&#x27;s more likely he acquired it much later in life.

It is not known when Henry Sinclair died. The Sinclair Diploma, written or at least commissioned by his grandson states: &quot;...he retirit to the parts of Orchadie and josit them to the latter tyme of his life, and deit Erile of Orchadie, and for the defence of the country was slain there cruellie by his enemiis...&quot; We also know that sometime in 1401: &quot;The English invaded, burnt and spoiled certain islands of Orkney.&quot; This was part of an English retaliation for a Scottish attack on an English fleet near Aberdeen. The assumption is that Henry either died opposing this invasion, or was already dead.

Henri Santo Claro (Henry St. Clair) signed a charter from King Robert III in January 1404. It is supposed that he died shortly after that although his son did not take the title until 1412. Therefore, he died somewhere between 1404 and 1412, killed in an attack on Orkney, possibly by English seamen. Or in an attack from the south.

According to Sir Robert Douglas, 6th Baronet, Sinclair had received the honours of the Orders of the Thistle, Saint Michael (Cockle) and the Golden Fleece. However all these orders were created after Sinclair&#x27;s death.

==Marriage and issue==
Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, married Jean Haliburton, daughter of Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton (d. 1392) by his spouse Margaret Cameron and sister of Sir Walter de Haliburton, 1st Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, and had issue:
# Henry II Sinclair, Earl of Orkney (c. 1375–1422), married Egidia Douglas, daughter of Sir William Douglas of Nithsdale and his wife Egidia Stewart, daughter of King Robert II of Scotland and second wife Euphemia de Ross
# John Sinclair, said to have married Ingeborg, a natural daughter of Waldemar IV, King of Denmark
# William Sinclair
# Elizabeth Sinclair (b. 1363), married Sir John Drummond of Cargill and Stobhall, 12th Thane of Lennox, Chief of Clan Drummond (b. Drymen, Stirlingshire, 1356, d. 1428), Justiciar of Scotia, and had issue: 
## Sir Walter Drummond of Cargill and Stobhall, Chief of Clan Drummond (d. 1455), married Margaret Ruthven, daughter of Sir William Ruthven of that Ilk and wife, had issue: 
### Sir Malcolm Drummond of Cargill and Stobhall, Chief of Clan Drummond (d. 1470), married in 1445 Mariot or Mariota Murray, daughter of Sir David Murray of Tullibardine and wife Margaret Colquhoun, had issue
#### James Drummond of Coldoch, married and had female issue
#### John Drummond, 1st Lord Drummond
### John Drummond
### Margaret Drummond (d. aft. 26 March 1482), married Andrew Mercer of Meikleour and Aldie (d. 1473), son of Michael Mercer (b. c. 1378, d. c. 1440) and wife Elizabeth Stewart, daughter of Sir Robert Stewart of Durrisdeer and wife Janet Macdougall, had issue
### Walter Drummond, 1st of Ledcrieff (d. aft. 1486), married and had issue
## John Drummond, who has been suggested, based on a reported deathbed confession, to be João Escórcio (John the Scotsman), a high ranking official in 15th century Madeira, Portugal, who hid his identity, and the progenitor of people bearing the surnames of Escórcio and Drummond in Madeira (the latter recognised by the gift of armorial bearings by Clan Drummond in 1519), though John Drummond being João Escórcio cannot be established beyond doubt. Born between 1395 and 1400 and died between 1460 and 1470, he was a Knight who in 1418 was in France with the Dauphin Charles VII against the English; in 1427 he went to Castille, Spain, where he fought alongside John II of Castile, ending up settling in Madeira, Portugal; in 1430 he obtained a land grant on the island of Madeira, where he married c. 1440 Branca Afonso, born in Covilhã, sister of the first vicar of Santa Cruz in Madeira Frei Hércules da Cunha, and had issue, soon extinct in male line. In 1519, and even later (1604, 1634), some descendants of João Escórcio established correspondence with members of the Drummond family of Stobhall, exchanging letters, some written in Latin. They are published in the book &quot;The Genealogy of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Drummond&quot;, published in Edinburgh in 1831 and translated and published in Volume III of the Madeira Historical Archive. In these letters, the Drummonds of Scotland confirm that a son of Lord Drummond, brother of Queen Arabella, went to France in the 1420s in search of honor and fame, with his family no longer hearing anything about him.
# Margaret Sinclair, married James of Cragy, Laird of Hupe in Orkney
# Marjory Sinclair, married David Menzies of that Ilk, and Weem
# Bethoc Sinclair, married William Borthwick of that Ilk
# Katherine Sinclair (1358-1430), married John Seton, 2nd Lord Seton, and had issue

==Fringe theories==
In the 1980s, modern alternative histories of Earl Henry I Sinclair and Rosslyn Chapel began to be published. Popular books (often derided as pseudo-historical) such as &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot; by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln (1982) and &quot;The Temple and the Lodge&quot; by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh (1989) appeared. Books by Timothy Wallace-Murphy and Andrew Sinclair soon followed from the early 1990s onwards.

===The alleged voyage to North America===

One of the most common theories about Sinclair is that he was one of the first Europeans to visit North America in a voyage pre-dating Columbus. In 1784, he was identified by Johann Reinhold Forster as possibly being the Prince Zichmni described in letters allegedly written around the year 1400 by the Zeno brothers of Venice, in which they describe a voyage throughout the North Atlantic under the command of Zichmni.

The letters and the accompanying map, allegedly rediscovered and published in the early 16th century, are regarded by most historians as a hoax by the Zenos or their publishers. Moreover, the identification of Zichmni as Henry Sinclair has not been accepted by most historians, although this identification and their overall authenticity are taken for granted by the supporters of the theory.

The claim that Henry Sinclair explored North America has been popularised by several other authors, notably by Frederick J. Pohl, Andrew Sinclair, Michael Bradley, William S. Crooker (who claimed to have discovered Henry Sinclair&#x27;s castle in Nova Scotia), Steven Sora, and more recently by David Goudsward. 

The claim requires the acceptance not only that the letters and map ascribed to the Zeno brothers and published in 1558 are authentic, but that the voyage described in the letters as taken by Zichmni around the year 1398 to Greenland actually reached North America and that Zichmni is Henry Sinclair. It is also bolstered by claims that carvings in Rosslyn Chapel represent American plants. 

The name &quot;Zichmni&quot; is either totally fictitious, or quite possibly a transliteration error when converting from handwritten materials to type. Forster tried to relate this to the name &quot;Sinclair&quot;, while to Pohl &quot;Prince Zichmni&quot; was a misread rendering of the title &quot;Prince of Orkney&quot;, which he attributed to Sinclair.

One primary criticism of this theory is that if either a Sinclair or a Templar voyage reached the Americas, they did not, unlike Columbus, return with a historical record of their findings. In fact, there is no known published documentation from that era to support the theory that such a voyage took place. The physical evidence relies on speculative reasoning to support the theory, and all of it can be interpreted in other ways. For example, according to one historian, the carvings in Rosslyn Chapel may not be of American plants at all but are nothing more than stylised carvings of wheat and strawberries.

=== Alleged Templar connections ===
Intertwined with the Sinclair voyage story is the claim that Henry Sinclair was a Knight Templar and that the voyage either was sponsored by or conducted on the behalf of the Templars, though the order was suppressed almost half a century before Henry&#x27;s lifetime.

Knight and Lomas speculate that the Knights Templar discovered under the Temple Mount in Jerusalem a royal archive dating from King Solomon&#x27;s times that stated that Phoenicians from Tyre voyaged to a westerly continent following a star called &quot;La Merika&quot; named after the Nasoraean Mandaean morning star. According to Knight and Lomas, the Templars learned that to sail to that continent, they had to follow a star by the same name. Sinclair supposedly followed this route.

The theory also makes use of the supposed Templar connection to explain the name Nova Scotia (&quot;New Scotland&quot; in Latin). It is based on the 18th-century tale that some Templars escaped the suppression of their order by fleeing to Scotland during the reign of Robert the Bruce and fought in the Battle of Bannockburn.

Claims persist that Rosslyn Chapel contains Templar imagery. Andrew Sinclair speculates that the grave slab now in the crypt is that of a Templar knight: According to author Robert Lomas, the chapel also has an engraving depicting a knight templar holding the sword over a head of an initiate, supposedly to protect the secrets of the templars. Rosslyn Chapel was built by Sir William St Clair, last St Clair Earl of Orkney, who was the grandson of Henry. According to Lomas, Sir William, the chapel builder, is also the direct ancestor of the first Grand Master of Masons of Scotland, also named William St Clair (Sinclair).

According to Lomas, the Sinclairs and their French relatives, the St. Clairs, were instrumental in creating the Knights Templar. He claims that the founder of Templars Hugues de Payens was married to a sister of the Duke of Champaine (Henri de St. Clair), who was a powerful broker of the First Crusade and had the political power to nominate the Pope, and to suggest the idea and empower it to the Pope.

However, a biography of Hughes de Payens by Thierry Leroy identifies his wife and the mother of his children as Elizabeth de Chappes. The book draws its information on the marriage from local church cartularies dealing chiefly with the disposition of the Grand Master&#x27;s properties, the earliest alluding to Elizabeth as his wife in 1113, and others spanning de Payens’ lifetime, the period following his death and lastly her own death in 1170.

Historians Mark Oxbrow, Ian Robertson, Karen Ralls and Louise Yeoman have each made it clear that the Sinclair family had no connection with the mediaeval Knights Templar. Karen Ralls has shown that among those testifying against the Templars at their 1309 trial were Henry and William Sinclair – an act inconsistent with any alleged support or membership.

<text>Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, 4th Baron Percy, titular King of Mann, KG, Lord Marshal (10 November 134120 February 1408) was the son of Henry de Percy, 3rd Baron Percy, and a descendant of Henry III of England. His mother was Mary of Lancaster, daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, son of Edmund, Earl of Leicester and Lancaster, who was the son of Henry III.

==Life==

Henry Percy was originally a follower of Edward III of England, for whom he held high offices in the administration of northern England. At a young age, he was made Warden of the Marches towards Scotland in 1362, with the authority to negotiate with the Scottish government. In February 1367, he was entrusted with the supervision of all castles and fortified places in the Scottish marches. He went on to support King Richard II, was formally created an Earl on Richard&#x27;s coronation in 1377, and was briefly given the title of Marshal of England. Between 1383 and 1384, he was appointed Admiral of the Northern Seas. After Richard elevated his rival Ralph Neville to the position of Earl of Westmorland in 1397, Percy and his son, also Henry and known as &quot;Hotspur&quot;, supported the rebellion of Henry Bolingbroke, who became King as Henry IV.

On King Henry IV&#x27;s coronation, Henry Percy was appointed Constable of England and granted the lordship of the Isle of Man. Percy and Hotspur were given the task of subduing the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr, but their attempts to make peace with the Welsh rebels did not meet with the king&#x27;s approval.

==Rebellion==
In September 1402 the Percys took part in the Battle of Homildon Hill, which led to the capture of many Scots nobles. Henry did not want them to be ransomed, leading to another quarrel.
In 1403 the Percys turned against Henry IV in favour of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, and then conspired with Owain Glyndŵr against Henry. The Percy rebellion failed at the Battle of Shrewsbury, where Hotspur was killed. Since the earl did not directly participate in the rebellion, he was not convicted of treason. However, he lost his office as Constable.

In 1405 all three parties signed the Tripartite Indenture, which divided England up between them. Glyndŵr was to be given Wales, and a substantial part of the west of England, Northumberland was to have received the north of England, as well as Northamptonshire, Norfolk, Warwickshire, and Leicestershire. The Mortimers were to have received the rest of southern England, below the river Trent.

Later in 1405 Percy supported Richard le Scrope, Archbishop of York, in another rebellion, after which Percy fled to Scotland, and his estates were confiscated by the king.

In 1408 Percy invaded England in rebellion once more and was killed at the Battle of Bramham Moor. His severed head was subsequently put on display at London Bridge.

==Marriages and issue==

In 1358, he married Margaret Neville (12 February 133912 May 1372), daughter of Ralph Neville, 2nd Baron Neville de Raby, and Alice de Audley. They had four sons (Harry &quot;Hotspur&quot; Percy, Thomas, Ralph, and Alan) and one daughter (Margaret).
In 1381, he married Maud Lucy (134318 December 1398), daughter of Sir Thomas de Lucy, 2nd Baron Lucy, and Margaret de Multon, and thus sister and heiress of Anthony Lucy, 3rd Baron Lucy (died 1368), of Cockermouth Castle, Cumbria, which estate he inherited on condition that he and his heirs male should bear the arms of Lucy (&quot;Gules, three lucies hauriant argent&quot;) quarterly with their own. They had no issue.

== In literature and media ==

Northumberland is a major character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, part 1&quot;, and &quot;Henry IV, part 2.&quot;

His position as a character in the Shakespearean canon inspired the character of Lord Percy Percy, heir to the duchy of Northumberland in the historical sitcom &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, set during the very late Plantagenet era.

The novel &quot;Lion of Alnwick&quot; by Carol Wensby-Scott is the first volume of the Percy Saga trilogy which retells the story of &quot;the wild and brilliant Percy family&quot; and relates a fictionalised account of the lives of the 1st Earl of Northumberland and his son Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot; Percy. The other novels in the trilogy, &quot;Lion Dormant&quot; and &quot;Lion Invincible&quot; tell the story of his other descendants and their role in the English War of the Roses.

Henry Percy and his son Hotspur are also essential characters in Edith Pargeter&#x27;s novel, &quot;A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury&quot; which recounts the events leading up to the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403.

He is a major character in &quot;My Lord John&quot; by Georgette Heyer.

<text>Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland (3 February 139322 May 1455) was an English nobleman and military commander in the lead up to the Wars of the Roses. He was the son of Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot; Percy, and the grandson of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. His father and grandfather were killed in different rebellions against Henry IV in 1403 and 1408, respectively, and the young Henry spent his minority in exile in Scotland. Only after the death of Henry IV in 1413 was he reconciled with the Crown, and in 1414 he was created Earl of Northumberland.

In the following years, Northumberland occasionally served with the king in France, but his main occupation was the protection of the border to Scotland. At the same time, a feud with the Neville family was developing, particularly with Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury. This feud became entangled with the conflict between the Dukes of York and Somerset over control of national government. The conflict culminated in the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, at St Albans, where both Somerset and Northumberland were killed.

==Family background==
Henry Percy was the son of Sir Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot; Percy, and Lady Elizabeth Mortimer. Elizabeth was the daughter of Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March and Philippa, Countess of Ulster, daughter of Elizabeth de Burgh and Lionel of Antwerp, son of Edward III. Hotspur&#x27;s father—the young Henry&#x27;s grandfather—was also called Henry Percy, and in 1377 became the first of the Percy family to hold the title of Earl of Northumberland. 

Both Hotspur and his father were early and active supporters of Henry Bolingbroke, who usurped the throne from Richard II in 1399, and became King Henry IV. They were initially richly rewarded, but soon grew disillusioned with the new regime. Hotspur rose up in rebellion, and was killed at Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403.

Hotspur&#x27;s father, the earl, was not present at the battle, but there is little doubt that he participated in the rebellion. After a short imprisonment, he was pardoned, and in June 1404 he delivered his grandson into the king&#x27;s custody at Doncaster. 

By May 1405, however, the earl was involved in another rebellion. His plans failed, and he was forced to flee to Scotland, taking his grandson with him. The following years were marked by an itinerant life and further plotting, while the young Henry remained in the custody of the Duke of Albany. On 19 February 1408, the first earl of Northumberland was killed in the Battle of Bramham Moor, leaving the young Henry Percy as heir apparent to the earldom. 

Henry remained in Scotland until the accession of Henry V in 1413, when he tried to claim his grandfather&#x27;s title. His cause was aided by the king&#x27;s aunt, Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, who arranged his marriage to her daughter Eleanor. 

It was in Henry V&#x27;s interest to reconcile with the Percys, with their vast network in the north of England; on 11 May 1414, Henry Percy was restored to the Earldom of Northumberland, followed by a formal creation on 16 March 1416.

==Service to the king==

Northumberland served occasionally in Henry V&#x27;s wars in France over the following years. He joined the king on an expedition to the Continent in 1416, and sent a minor contingent of soldiers the next year. His main task, however, was the defence of the Scottish Borders, and on 16 December 1416 he was appointed Warden of the East March. In late August 1417, the Scots invaded northern England; while Albany laid siege to Berwick Castle, the Earl of Douglas attempted to take Roxburgh Castle. Percy lifted the siege of Berwick, and forced both Albany and Douglas across the border. At the same time, he was also involved in national political affairs, and acted as steward at the coronation of Henry&#x27;s queen Catherine on 24 February 1421.

When Henry V died in 1422, Northumberland was appointed a member of the council appointed to govern during the minority of Henry VI. He might have been involved in an embassy to the Council of Siena in 1423, but still, his main area of responsibility lay in the border region. In the council, he seems to have belonged to Bishop Henry Beaufort&#x27;s social circle, and he followed Beaufort—now cardinal—to peace negotiations at Berwick in 1429. As Warden of the East March, he was constantly occupied with peace negotiations and defence of northern England, but his efforts were constantly frustrated, and in 1434 he resigned his commission. The next year, Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, equally exasperated by the lack of royal support, gave up his commission as Warden of the West March. Northumberland was appointed joint warden with the earl of Huntingdon of both marches for one year, during which time, although suffering defeat by the Earl of Angus at the Battle of Piperdean, he was able to repel a siege on Roxburgh by James I of Scotland. In 1440 he was once more appointed Warden of the West March, and this time held the position until his death.

==Feud with Neville family==
Initially, Northumberland&#x27;s relations with the other great northern family, the Nevilles, were friendly. He was already connected to the Beaufort-Nevilles through his marriage with Eleanor Neville, and in 1426 he married his sister Elizabeth to the young Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland. In the early 1440s, Northumberland was involved in other disputes. A conflict over land with the Archbishop of York escalated into open violence. The king intervened on the archbishop&#x27;s side, though Northumberland remained in favour at court. Nevertheless, he spent less time involved in central affairs at Westminster in the later 1440s.

In the early 1450s, the relationship between the Percy family and the Earl of Salisbury—Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland&#x27;s son by his second wife Joan Beaufort—started to deteriorate. What triggered the conflict was the marriage between Salisbury&#x27;s son Thomas and Maud Stanhope, niece and heiress of Lord Cromwell. By this marriage Wressle Castle, which had traditionally been in the possession of the Percy family, would pass to the Nevilles. At the same time, the Neville-Cromwell wedding had led Huntingdon (now Duke of Exeter) to join the cause of the Percys, because of a territorial dispute with Cromwell. Northumberland himself, who was nearing sixty, did not take action at the time, but one of his younger sons did. Thomas Percy had been created Baron Egremont in 1449, relating to his possessions in the Neville-dominated county of Cumberland. On 24 August 1453, Thomas attacked the Neville-Cromwell wedding party at Heworth near York with a force of over 700 men. No one was killed in the skirmish, and the wedding party escaped intact.

The conflict, however, continued over the following years. On 8 October, Northumberland and Salisbury were summoned to court and ordered to end the conflict, but the warnings were ignored. Instead, the collective forces of the Percy and Neville families gathered at their Yorkshire strongholds of Topcliffe and Sand Hutton, respectively, only a few miles apart. Both sides had ignored royal commands to disband, and battle seemed inevitable, but eventually a truce ensued and the forces withdrew. Then, in October 1454, Thomas Percy and his brother Richard were captured by the Nevilles in a battle at Stamford Bridge. The conflict was escalating, and converging with events in national politics.

==Towards civil war==

Discontent was brewing in England against the personal rule of Henry VI, who had been declared of age in 1437. The main antagonists were Richard, Duke of York, and Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. Somerset enjoyed great influence over the king, but after Henry had been incapacitated by mental illness in 1453, York was appointed protector in 1454. The Nevilles were by this time closely associated with York, so the natural option for Northumberland was to side with Somerset and the king. Attempts were made to reconcile Northumberland and Salisbury in the north, but little was accomplished. In December, the king rallied sufficiently to resume control of government, and York&#x27;s protectorate was terminated. With Somerset back at the centre of power, civil war seemed imminent.

In May 1455, Northumberland was travelling with the king and Somerset to a great council at Leicester, when the party was intercepted by York and the Nevilles. On 22 May 1455, at the First Battle of St Albans, the royal forces clashed with the forces loyal to the Duke of York, in what has been described as the first battle of the Wars of the Roses. The battle was a complete victory for the Yorkist side, and led to another reversal of the political situation. The king was taken captive, and Somerset was killed. Northumberland was also among the casualties, and was buried at the nearby St Albans Abbey. A suggestion made by a contemporary chronicler, and supported by modern-day historians, said that the true purpose of the battle was to settle personal scores. Once York and Salisbury had killed Somerset and Northumberland, respectively, the battle was effectively over.

== Estates and family ==
The Percy estates were primarily located in the northern counties of Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Cumberland. Even though the title was restored in 1416, and the Percy estates were officially regranted, this did not mean the immediate return of all the family possessions. Protracted legal battles followed, particularly with John, Duke of Bedford. Even at the time of his death, Northumberland had not recovered all the estates once held by his grandfather.

Northumberland&#x27;s marriage to Eleanor Neville produced at least ten children. Henry Percy was succeeded by his son Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, who himself died fighting in the Wars of the Roses, at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461.

<text>Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, (25 July 1421 – 29 March 1461) was an English magnate.

The Earldom of Northumberland was then one of the greatest landholdings in northern England; Percy also became Lord Poynings on his marriage. This title would bring him into direct conflict with the Poynings family themselves, and indeed, feuds with neighbouring nobles, both lay and ecclesiastical, would be a key occupancy of his youth.

Percy married Eleanor Poynings, who outlived him; together they had four children. He was a leading Lancastrian during the Wars of the Roses, from which he managed to personally benefit, although his father died early in the war. He was not, however, to live to enjoy these gains, being killed at the Battle of Towton in 1461 on the defeated Lancastrian side.

==Early life and war with Scotland==
Percy was the son of Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, and Lady Eleanor Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and his second wife, Joan Beaufort.

Percy was knighted in 1426 together with Henry VI. He was appointed Warden of the Eastern March on the Scottish border on 1 April 1440, originally for four years, and subsequent extensions in 1444, and 1445, for the next seven years. This came as well with the custody of Berwick Castle and responsibility for its defence He was to hold this post until March 1461. In May 1448, Percy, with his father and Sir Robert Ogle, invaded Scotland and burnt Dunbar and Dumfries, for which, in revenge, the Scots attacked his father&#x27;s castles of Alnwick and Warkworth. King Henry made his way north, and whilst at Durham sent Percy – now Lord Poynings – to raid Dumfrieshire; the sortie – &quot;only to return with some 500 cattle&quot; – of around 5,000 men failed, and he was captured whilst caught in a marsh following his father&#x27;s defeat at the River Sark on 23 October. Sir Robert Ogle was now outlawed and the king used half of his estates to compensate Poynings for the ransom he had expended arranging his release from captivity.

Tensions with Scotland remained, to the extent that Poynings, his father, and other nobles were requested to stay and guard the border rather than attend Parliament, for which they were excused. In summer 1451, with an Anglo-Scottish truce pending, Poynings was commissioned to treat with Scottish embassies. In July 1455, he successfully prevented an assault on Berwick by the Scottish King, James II, and was congratulated by the English King as a result.
==Feud with the Poynings==
In the late 1440s, the Yorkshire tenants of his father, the Earl of Northumberland, were in almost constant conflict with their neighbours, those of the Archbishop of York, involving armed skirmishes which Percy&#x27;s brothers led. These events were deemed so severe that in 1448 they led to the only progress north for the King during his reign. The same year, because of a dispute over the inheritance his family received as a result of Henry Percy&#x27;s marriage, the Earl of Northumberland&#x27;s retainers had ejected the earl&#x27;s relative, Robert Poynings, from his Sussex manors. A year later, Henry Percy – now Lord Poynings by right of his wife – took direct part, with his father, in raiding the manor of Newington Bertram in Kent, which was also enfeoffed by Robert. This attack also apparently involved cattle rustling and theft, and Robert later claimed it to be so brutal that he was &quot;deterred from seeking a remedy at law for three years&quot;.

==Feud with Nevilles==

By the early 1450s, relations with a powerful neighbouring family, the Nevilles, became increasingly tense, and Poynings&#x27; brother Thomas, Lord Egremont, had finally ambushed a Neville force, returning from a wedding, near Sheriff Hutton, with a force of between 1,000 and 5,000 men. Although this was a bloodless confrontation, a precedent for the use of force in this particular dispute had already been laid in the previous violence in the region. By October 1453, Poynings was directly involved, with his father, brothers Egremont and Richard, and joined by Lord Clifford, in forcing a battle with John and Richard Neville at Topcliffe. The feud continued into the next year, when Poynings reportedly planned on attending parliament accompanied by a large force of men in February, and three months later both he and the earl were summoned by the king to attend council in an attempt to impose a peace; a second letter was &quot;written but not despatched&quot;. Neither, along with John Neville or Salisbury, did as requested.

==Wars of the Roses==

During the Wars of the Roses, Percy followed his father in siding with the Lancastrians against the Yorkists. The Earl himself died at what is generally considered to be the first battle of the wars, at St Alban&#x27;s on 22 May 1455, and Poynings was elevated as third Earl of Northumberland, without having to pay relief to the Crown, because his father had died in the King&#x27;s service. He in his turn &quot;swore to uphold the Lancastrian dynasty&quot;. Although a reconciliation of the leading magnates of the realm was attempted in October 1458 in London, he arrived with such a large body of men (thought to be around 1,500) that the city denied him entry. The new earl and his brother Egremont were bound over £4,000 each to keep the peace.

When conflict broke out again, he attended the so-called &quot;Parliament of Devils&quot; in October 1459, which condemned as traitors those Yorkists accused of, among other offences, causing the death of his father four years before. On 30 December 1460, Percy led the central &quot;battle&quot; or section of the victorious Lancastrian army at the Battle of Wakefield, following which, the army marched south, pillaging on the road to London. He fought against Warwick at the second Battle of St. Albans on 17 February 1461, and he commanded the Lancastrian van at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461, however, &quot;his archers were blinded by snowstorms&quot;, and he was either slain in close fighting or died of his wounds soon after. He was buried at St Denys&#x27;s Church, York. He was posthumously attainted by the first parliament of the victorious Edward IV in November 1461, and his son and namesake was committed to the Tower.

==Estates, offices and finances==
The estates of the Earls of Northumberland had traditionally been in constant use as a source of manpower and wages in defence of the border since the Percy family first gained the office the previous century. The wages assigned to the third Earl were substantial: £2,500 yearly in time of peace, and £5,000 during war, as well as an annual payment for the maintenance of Berwick&#x27;s upkeep (£66 in peacetime and £120 in wartime). Percy often had to provide from his own resources, however, as &quot;securing payment was not easy&quot; from the Exchequer, (for example, in 1454 he received no payments at all). In July 1452 he gained a twenty-year fee-farm (£80 yearly, from Carlisle), although he subsequently lost it in favour of Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, in July 1454. Throughout the 1450s, the Crown continually made efforts at paying Percy his Warden&#x27;s wages and fees promptly (paying him full wartime rates for the whole of the year 1456–7, for example), and since he was a loyal Lancastrian he achieved this more often than his counterpart on the west march, Salisbury, who by now had publicly aligned himself with York. The fee farm of Carlisle was returned to Percy in November 1459, following Salisbury&#x27;s attainder in Coventry. He also benefited from the attainder of York, being granted an annuity of £66 from the latter&#x27;s forfeited Wakefield Lordship in Yorkshire; he also received £200 from the profits of Penrith.

As a reward for his role in the Lancastrian victory at Ludford Bridge, he was made Chief Forester north of the River Trent and the Constable of Scarborough Castle on 22 December 1459 for life. He was nominated to a wide-ranging commission of oyer and terminer (from the old French, literally a commission &quot;to hear and determine&quot;) on 30 May 1460, his new rank was a tactic to deal with the treasons and insurrections in Northumberland. On 3 July, he was granted Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Cambridgeshire, all belonging to Salisbury, on a twelve-year lease. After the Yorkists captured Henry VI at the Battle of Northampton in 1460, they accused Percy of having looted York&#x27;s northern estates during his exile in Ireland. This charge was likely to have had some truth in it, as it was his continued pillaging of those estates, with the Lords Clifford and Dacre, that led to York marching north to Wakefield in December 1460. These incomes, however collected, would have been vital to the Earl both personally and militarily as his northern estates especially had been a victim of feudal decline for most of the first half of the fifteenth century: even on the forfeit of the earldom to the Crown in 1461, his arrears have been calculated as still standing at approximately £12,000.

==Family==

On or before 25 June 1435, by the arrangement in 1434 of his father and Cardinal Beaufort, he married Eleanor Poynings (c.1422-11 February 1484), &quot;suo jure&quot; Baroness Poynings, daughter and heiress of Sir Richard Poynings of Poynings in Sussex, by his second wife Eleanor Berkeley, a daughter of Sir John Berkeley of Beverston Castle in Gloucestershire. In 1446 she became heir general to her grandfather Robert Poynings, 4th Baron Poynings (1380–1446), inherited his title of Baron Poynings (which having been created by writ was able to descend to females) and his large estates across the south of England. He was summoned to Parliament from 14 December 1446 to 26 May 1455, by writs directed &quot;Henrico de Percy, chivaler, domino de Ponynges&quot; (&quot;Henry de Percy, Knight, lord of the manor of Poynings&quot;). His wife was a legatee in the 1455 will of her mother, Eleanor, Countess of Arundel (widow of John FitzAlan, 13th Earl of Arundel). They had at least one son and four daughters:

*Anne Percy (1444–1522), who married Sir Thomas Hungerford in 1460.
*Margaret Percy (b. c. 1447), who married Sir William Gascoigne 
*Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland (c. 1449 – 28 April 1489), who married Maud Herbert, daughter of the first Earl of Pembroke.
*Eleanor Percy (1455-c. 1477), who married Thomas West, 8th Baron De La Warr; they had no children.
*Elizabeth Percy (1460–1512), who married Henry Scrope, 6th Baron Scrope of Bolton.

<text>Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland ( 1449 – 28 April 1489) was an English aristocrat during the Wars of the Roses. After losing his title when his father was killed fighting the Yorkists, he later regained his position. He led the rearguard of Richard III&#x27;s army at the Battle of Bosworth, but failed to commit his troops. He was briefly imprisoned by Henry VII, but later restored to his position. A few years later he was murdered by citizens of York during a revolt against Henry VII&#x27;s taxation.

==Origins==
Percy was the son of Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, and his wife Eleanor Poynings.

His father was first cousin to (among others) Edward IV of England, Anne, Duchess of Exeter, Edmund, Earl of Rutland, Elizabeth, Duchess of Suffolk, Margaret of York, George, Duke of Clarence, and Richard III of England. Percy himself was second cousin to (among others) Elizabeth of York, Edward V of England, Richard, Duke of York, Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, Edward, Earl of Warwick, and Edward of Middleham. Both Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel claimed to be his second cousins.

==Loss and restoration of title==
His father was loyal to the House of Lancaster. His wife, Maud Herbert, had in fact been first betrothed to Henry of Richmond, who would usurp the throne in 1485 and become Henry VII. His father was killed in the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461. The earldom of Northumberland was forfeited to the victorious Yorkists. The adolescent Percy was imprisoned in the Fleet Prison. He was transported to the Tower of London in 1464.

In 1465, John Neville was named Earl of Northumberland in his place. Percy eventually swore fealty to Edward IV and was released in 1469. He petitioned for the return of his paternal titles and estates to him. He gained support from Edward IV himself. John Neville had to quit his title and was instead named Marquess of Montagu in 1470. However, the restoration of the title to Percy was delayed by the Parliament of England until 1473. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1474 by Edward IV.

For the following twelve years, Percy held many of the important government posts in northern England, such as warden of the east and middle marches, which were traditional in his family.

==Bosworth campaign and aftermath==
He commanded the Yorkist reserve at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. Percy never committed his forces to the battle. His inactivity played an important part in the defeat and death of Richard III. Historians suspect him of treason in favour of victor Henry VII of England, although there is an alternative theory that his forces, placed behind those of King Richard, were in no position to take part in the battle before Richard was killed.

Percy was arrested along with Ralph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland and Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. He was nominally imprisoned for several months but swore allegiance to the new King. Henry VII released him on terms of good behaviour. Percy was allowed to retain his titles and lands as well as being allowed to return to his old posts, and was in fact sent on diplomatic missions for the crown, something that would not have occurred had Henry VII not trusted him implicitly.

== Marriage and children ==
At some time between 1473 and 1476 he married Maud Herbert (died before 1485), daughter of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke and his wife Anne Devereux. Their children included:
*Henry Algernon Percy (died 1527), his heir, who married Catherine Spencer.
*Eleanor Percy (died 1530), who first married Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham.
*Sir William Percy (died 1540), who married first Agnes Constable and secondly Margaret Sothill, widow of Sir John Normanville.
*Alan Percy (died 1560), who became Master of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.
*Sir Josceline Percy (died 1532), who married Margaret Frost and was grandfather to Thomas Percy.
*Anne Percy (died 1552), who married as his second wife William FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel.

==Death==
In April 1489, Percy held temporary residence in his estates of Yorkshire. Henry VII had recently allied himself to Anne of Brittany against Charles VIII of France. Taxes rose to finance the military action. Sir John Egremont of Yorkshire led a riot in protest at the high taxation, known as the Yorkshire rebellion. Percy was targeted by the rioters as he approached the city and was slain on 28 April. He was buried at Beverley Minster.

<doc id="429143" wikidata="Q6142397" url="?curid=429143" title="USS Trigger (SS-237)">
<text>USS &quot;Trigger&quot; (SS-237) was a submarine, the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the triggerfish.

==Construction==
&quot;Trigger&quot;″s keel was laid down on 1 February 1941 at Mare Island, California, by the Mare Island Navy Yard. She was launched on 22 October 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Walter N. Vernou, and commissioned on 30 January 1942.

==Battle of Midway==
The submarine sailed for Hawaii on 22 May and reached Pearl Harbor the following week. She sortied for Midway Island with Task Group 7.2 (TG 7.2) on 29 May in anticipation of a Japanese attack on that island. Her station during the ensuing Battle of Midway was northeast of Midway, but her usefulness was curtailed when she ran aground. She freed from her grounding and returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 June.

== First patrol: June–August 1942 ==
On 26 June, &quot;Trigger&quot; got underway for the Aleutian Islands to patrol an area west of Cape Wrangell, Attu Island. She encountered six destroyers, three freighters and a patrol boat, attacking none, before calling at Dutch Harbor on 8 August &quot;en route&quot; back to Hawaii.

== Second patrol: September–November 1942 ==
Roy S. Benson assumed command before &quot;Trigger&quot; began her second war patrol, conducted from 23 September to 8 November in &quot;Empire Waters&quot; (the seas immediately surrounding Japan). In the early morning hours of 5 October, the submarine sighted smoke on the horizon and headed for it. A vessel soon appeared, coming toward the submarine. As the target approached, the submarine identified it as a small ship. &quot;Trigger&quot; then surfaced and manned her machine guns. As the target neared, however, the submarine learned that the Japanese ship was larger than initially thought. Enemy shells soon began exploding close to &quot;Trigger&quot;, and the 4,000 ton ship turned and accelerated in an attempt to ram the submarine. &quot;Trigger&quot; barely avoided a collision as she submerged for an attack; she launched two torpedoes and heard one hit. She then surfaced and gave chase, only to have the target again open fire. The submarine missed with three more torpedoes and then discontinued the pursuit.

Before dawn on the morning of 17 October, &quot;Trigger&quot; made a surface attack on a freighter off the Bungo Suido. She fired two spreads of torpedoes which sank &quot;Holland Maru&quot; with her guns still firing. That night, a destroyer came out of Bungo Suido and dropped a string of depth charges near the submarine. &quot;Trigger&quot; launched three torpedoes &quot;down the throat&quot; at the onrushing destroyer and, one minute later, observed an explosion so powerful it threw enough flame and water into the air to obscure the target. When the air cleared, the enemy ship was still intact, suggesting &quot;Trigger&quot;&#x27;s first torpedo may have exploded prematurely, detonating the next two by its turbulence. The submarine fired one more torpedo as the enemy disappeared, but failed to score a hit.

Near midnight of 20 October, &quot;Trigger&quot; fired a spread of four torpedoes from very close range, , in a surface attack on a 10,000-ton tanker. Two torpedoes hit the enemy ship as it turned in an attempt to ram. The submarine went to to evade a counterattack, and heard a heavy explosion as either gasoline, magazines, or boilers blew up. &quot;Trigger&quot; then came up to periscope level but found nothing in sight. (This sinking was not confirmed by JANAC postwar.) Four days later, &quot;Trigger&quot; attacked a large enemy tanker in ballast. A spread of three torpedoes produced three observed hits, one near the target&#x27;s stern. The screws of the enemy ship stopped, and she began emitting heavy white smoke aft, but she soon got underway again. &quot;Trigger&quot; fired her last torpedo at the ship as it was moving off and missed. That night, she surfaced and began her homeward voyage.

== Third patrol: December 1942–January 1943 ==

From 3 December 1942 to 22 January 1943, the submarine conducted a combined minelaying and offensive patrol, again in waters surrounding the Japanese home islands. On 20 December, she began planting a minefield off Inubo Saki, Honshū. &quot;Trigger&quot; planted the northern half of the field and was working on the southern part when a cargo ship passed her, heading into the newly-laid mines. Five minutes later, a violent explosion rocked the freighter which sank while an escort circled her. The submarine later heard another explosion from the direction of the minefield and, when she surfaced the next day, found the field was covered by smoke.

On 22 December, &quot;Trigger&quot; sighted a ship approaching from Uraga and made a surface attack. A spread of three torpedoes produced one hit forward of the bridge, and the target started to settle by the bow. The submarine fired one more torpedo into the ship and, when last seen, &quot;Teifuku Maru&quot; was awash forward with her screws nearly out of the water. On 31 December 1942, she attacked a cargo ship loaded with planes. &quot;Trigger&quot; fired three torpedoes from extremely close range , and watched two hit. The target began to list to starboard and was down by the bow. Sound reported a heavy secondary explosion. The submarine came up to periscope level and saw the freighter with her stern high out of the water and a destroyer approaching. &quot;Trigger&quot; went deep and when she next came up for a look, there was nothing to be seen. (The sinking was not confirmed by JANAC postwar.)

On 10 January 1943, a Japanese destroyer approached &quot;Trigger&quot;, and the submarine fired three torpedoes from . One hit under the well deck and folded the destroyer&#x27;s forecastle up at a 45° angle, and another hit the target&#x27;s stern. Soon, the destroyer sank on an even keel.

== Fourth patrol: February–April 1943 ==
&quot;Trigger&quot; stood out of Midway on 13 February to patrol off the Palau Islands. Two weeks later, she launched four torpedoes at a freighter, but the target managed to steer between them. Heavy air cover prevented a second attack. On 4 March, the submarine attacked a freighter in a rain squall, but all three of her torpedoes missed. On 15 March, &quot;Trigger&quot; sighted a convoy steaming in two columns. There were two freighters in the right hand column and three in the left, with an escort on the outboard bow of each column. &quot;Trigger&quot; worked her way between the two columns and launched three torpedoes at each of the leading ships. She hit the lead freighter in the left hand column twice but missed her target on the right because it unexpectedly changed course. &quot;Trigger&quot; then fired three more torpedoes at the right lead ship at just and observed two hits before the escorts forced her to go deep. When she surfaced again, there was nothing to be seen. &quot;Trigger&quot; was later officially credited with having sunk &quot;Momoha Maru&quot;, a 3,103-ton cargo ship.

That night, the submarine fired six torpedoes at a ship that was being towed by a smaller freighter. Five of the torpedoes missed, and the sixth made a circular run and passed over the submarine&#x27;s engine room. A shaken crew broke off the attack.

On 20 March, the submarine launched three torpedoes at the lead ship in a convoy of four cargo ships. One hit caused the target to list 10° to port and stop, but it soon got underway and rejoined the convoy. &quot;Trigger&quot; terminated the patrol at the Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor, on 6 April.

== Fifth patrol: April–June 1943 ==
Between 30 April and 22 June, the submarine made a patrol which returned her to Empire waters. Directed by an Ultra from Pearl Harbor, &quot;Trigger&quot; lay athwart the projected track of Admiral Koga&#x27;s task force returning from Truk. Koga&#x27;s force came in sight the morning of 22 May, but zigged away, out of range, &quot;a bitter disappointment&quot;. On 28 May, &quot;Trigger&quot; contacted two freighters off Iro Saki and fired three torpedoes at the larger. One hit aft. When last seen, the ship was down by the stern. The next day, the submarine fired a spread of three torpedoes at a small cargo ship. Two missed and the third exploded prematurely. She then fired a fourth torpedo, which apparently hit but failed to explode.

On 1 June, the submarine was searching for Japanese shipping off Sagami Nada when she sighted two columns of smoke. She closed the range toward a firing position, made out two cargo ships, and fired a spread of three torpedoes at each target. Hit in her stern, the lead ship, &quot;Noborikawa Maru&quot;, sank immediately. The second ship saw the torpedo wakes, turned and passed between them. &quot;Trigger&quot; then fired a torpedo at the oncoming ship; if the torpedo reached the target, it failed to explode.

Again alerted by Ultra, on 10 June (her last day on station), &quot;Trigger&quot; sighted an aircraft carrier protected by two destroyers. She closed and fired six torpedoes from only . Although as she went deep the submarine heard four explosions, postwar accounting showed two of the torpedoes missed ahead and one failed to explode. The escorts kept &quot;Trigger&quot; down for several hours. The damaged limped into Tokyo Bay and was out of action for almost a year. Admiral Lockwood (), who knew &quot;Hiyō&quot;″s fate, was furious. Had the torpedoes functioned correctly, Benson would have sunk her. The next day, &quot;Trigger&quot; began her return voyage to Pearl Harbor; just after her triumphant return, the Mark 14 torpedo&#x27;s defective Mark 6 exploder was ordered deactivated.

== Sixth patrol: September 1943 ==
On 1 September, after a yard overhaul, &quot;Trigger&quot; (now in the charge of Commander Robert &quot;Dusty&quot; Dornin) was ready to begin her sixth war patrol. The patrol took her into the East China Sea, off the China coast, north of Formosa. On 17 September, she made two hits on a Japanese freighter, one aft and one on the bow, but both torpedoes proved to be duds. The next day, she again contacted the same ship and launched four torpedoes at her. One struck &quot;Yowa Maru&quot;, and the 6,435-ton cargo ship slid beneath the waves.

21 September was &quot;Trigger&quot;″s best day. She was patrolling some north of the Hoka Sho light when she sighted a convoy of three tankers and three freighters protected by Japanese planes. The submarine attacked the tankers first, firing three torpedoes at the leader and three at the second. One hit aft was seen on the lead tanker, and flames shot over into the air. The target&#x27;s crew, dressed in whites, could be seen running forward to escape the fire. One torpedo hit the second tanker amidships, and it broke in half beneath the stack and sank immediately. &quot;Trigger&quot; turned and fired three stern tubes at the third tanker. This target swung toward the submarine, and all three torpedoes missed. &quot;Trigger&quot; then fired another torpedo which hit that ship&#x27;s starboard side. When the submarine went deep, Dornin slipped and fell into the periscope well as the quartermaster was lowering it. He supported himself on his elbows, and the quartermaster heard his shouts in time to prevent a serious accident. Sonar reported two more explosions before the submarine came back up to periscope depth to resume the attack. &quot;Trigger&quot; fired two bow torpedoes at the third freighter in the column and scored two hits on the target which went down by the bow. The submarine then made two more attacks on the freighter, but all of her torpedoes either missed or were duds. During the three and one-half hours of action, &quot;Trigger&quot; sank two tankers, &quot;Shiriya&quot; and &quot;Shoyo Maru&quot;, and a freighter, &quot;Argun Maru&quot;, for a total of 20,660 tons of enemy shipping. The submarine returned to Midway on 30 September to be refitted and rearmed.

== Seventh patrol: October–December 1943 ==
The East China Sea and Yellow Sea were &quot;Trigger&quot;″s objective for her seventh patrol. She stood out of Midway on 22 October and proceeded to her patrol area. At 22:00 on 1 November, she sighted a convoy that was steaming in two columns. When a ship in the nearer column overlapped one in the more distant group, &quot;Trigger&quot; fired a spread of three torpedoes at them. One torpedo struck the nearer freighter in the bow and one hit the farther ship amidships. The submarine saw the nearer ship go down by the bow, before she herself was forced to go deep where she was severely depth-charged by two escorts.

Early the next morning (2 November), &quot;Trigger&quot; launched three torpedoes at a freighter and scored one hit. At 00:50, she attacked the ship again with another three-torpedo spread. Two of them hit forward, and &quot;Yawata Maru&quot; went down, bow first, in a vertical plunge. Two hours and 25 minutes later, &quot;Trigger&quot; launched three torpedoes at a 7,148-ton transport. All hit, and &quot;Delagoa Maru&quot; disintegrated. On 5 November, the submarine attacked a convoy of three cargo ships protected by one destroyer and two planes. &quot;Trigger&quot; fired three bow tubes at the second ship in the convoy and one bow tube at the third before going deep to avoid the escort which dropped 20 depth charges. Thinking she was clear, the submarine came to periscope depth and was greeted by five near bomb misses.

On 13 November, &quot;Trigger&quot; made a submerged approach on a convoy of nine merchantmen and four escorts. After the Japanese ships zigged, the submarine found herself between two columns of ships, but &quot;Trigger&quot; had no torpedoes remaining in her bow tubes. She emptied her stern tubes at the last and biggest ship, believed to be a transport, from a pointblank range, . The target, which carried a large deck cargo, took one hit aft and one under her stack. The submarine went deep, received a short depth charge attack, and came up to periscope depth to learn that her target had gone down. On 21 November, &quot;Trigger&quot; sighted a cargo ship and closed to before firing four torpedoes. Two hits started the victim down by the bow as the submarine&#x27;s crew took turns at the periscope to watch &quot;Eizan Maru&quot; sink. More than a fortnight later, the submarine arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 December 1943.

== Eighth patrol: January–February 1944 ==
&quot;Trigger&quot; stood out to sea on New Year&#x27;s Day 1944 to begin her eighth war patrol, this time in the Truk-Guam shipping lanes. On 27 January, she sighted the conning tower of an submarine dead ahead. &quot;Trigger&quot; set up to fire a bow shot from . She came to periscope depth and saw the Japanese submarine, then less than away, was preparing to attack. &quot;Trigger&quot; submerged to , expecting a torpedo at any minute, but sound heard no torpedo screws. She came up to periscope depth and saw the Japanese periscope so she decided to make an end around. When &quot;Trigger&quot; returned to periscope depth, the enemy had disappeared.

Four days later, she contacted a convoy of three ships accompanied by two destroyers. The submarine scored two hits on the coastal minelayer &quot;Nasami&quot;, which disappeared in a cloud of smoke and debris. The nearer destroyer began closing the range, and &quot;Trigger&quot; missed it with four aft tubes. She caught up with the convoy again and fired five torpedoes at the last ship. Two hits produced flames that reached mast height and several secondary explosions that marked the end of the 11,933-ton converted submarine tender . Over three weeks later, the submarine terminated the patrol when she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 February.

==Ninth patrol: March–May 1944==
On 23 March, &quot;Trigger&quot; (now in the able hands of Commander Frederick J. &quot;Fritz&quot; Harlfinger II, and still with &quot;Ned&quot; Beach as executive officer) headed for the Palau Islands on her ninth war patrol. In the early morning of 8 April, she contacted a convoy of approximately 20 large ships with an estimated 25 escorts, and closed to attack. When she raised her periscope, she saw a destroyer away firing at the scope and attempting to ram. The submarine loosed four torpedoes at the convoy and went deep as several more escorts joined the attack. On her way down, she heard four explosions. &quot;Trigger&quot; ran at or more for 17 hours as six escorts dogged her trail and rained down numerous depth charges. Six exploded extremely close. When the submarine surfaced, her forward torpedo room was flooded to her deck plates, and the hull air induction and most compartments were in about the same condition. The bow planes, trim pump, sound gear, and both radars were all dead. Her radio antenna was grounded, and the submarine could not transmit. The crew spent the next four days making repairs &quot;by use of spares, baling wire, and considerable ingenuity.&quot;

&quot;Trigger&quot; met submarine on 14 April and exchanged information by line gun. The next day, &quot;Trigger&quot;″s executive officer went on board &quot;Tang&quot; by a rubber boat, to borrow an air compressor part and to make plans for a coordinated search and attack. On 18 April, &quot;Tang&quot;″s executive officer delivered spare parts for the air compressor to &quot;Trigger&quot;, and she continued on patrol.

Shortly before midnight on 26 April, &quot;Trigger&quot; contacted a convoy of six ships off the eastern Palaus. She fired six torpedoes, from , at four ships that were closely bunched and overlapping. Four hits were seen and heard, with a big explosion on each ship. Suddenly, a terrific explosion blew up one of the closer ships. One of the more distant ships stood straight up on her bow and sank immediately. At six minutes after midnight, &quot;Trigger&quot; launched three torpedoes at another group of ships and heard one timed explosion. At 01:57, she launched four torpedoes at a damaged cargo ship and two at an escort. The cargo ship received two more hits. Five minutes later, the submarine fired three stern tubes at a group of three escorts, and the middle one disappeared in a cloud of smoke. During the attack, &quot;Trigger&quot; sank the 11,739-ton passenger/cargo ship &quot;Miike Maru&quot; and heavily damaged the destroyer escort &quot;Kasado&quot;, the 9,467-ton cargo ship , and the 8,811 ton cargo ship &quot;Asosan Maru&quot;. &quot;Trigger&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 May and four days later, headed for the United States for a major overhaul. She arrived at San Francisco, California, on 31 May and, after overhaul, returned to Hawaii on 11 September.

== Tenth patrol: September–November 1944 ==
On 24 September, &quot;Trigger&quot; got underway to take station off the east coast of Formosa and perform life guard patrol for bomber strikes due on 12 October. The morning of the strikes, she rescued a pilot from aircraft carrier whose burning plane had crash-landed nearby. On 19 October, as the invasion of the Philippines was about to begin, &quot;Trigger&quot; contacted a convoy of two heavy cruisers, one cruiser, two other light cruisers, and several destroyers with air cover. &quot;Trigger&quot; had no chance to fire but reported the contact. On 30 October, she launched four torpedoes at a tanker but missed. She then fired another four from her stern tubes and heard one hit the target before running up the periscope to watch the other three blow off part of the stern, but the ship did not sink. &quot;Trigger&quot; went deep as 78 depth charges were rained down on her within the next hour, but caused no damage. The damaged 10,021-ton tanker &quot;Takane Maru&quot; was later sunk by submarines and . The next morning, &quot;Trigger&quot; received word from &quot;Salmon&quot; that she had been heavily damaged by depth charges and was unable to submerge. &quot;Trigger&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Salmon&quot; that night and was joined by and &quot;Sterlet&quot; to escort the damaged submarine to Saipan. They were provided with air cover from the Mariana Islands and arrived at Tanapag Harbor on 3 November. A week later, &quot;Trigger&quot; departed with six other submarines but was ordered to discontinue her patrol on 17 November and returned to Guam.

== Eleventh patrol: December 1944–February 1945 ==
On 28 December 1944, &quot;Trigger&quot; headed for the Bungo Suido-Kii Suido area to begin her 11th war patrol. At 21:05 on 3 January 1945, she sighted a light, and radar made a doubtful contact. Thirty minutes later, a torpedo passed by her starboard side. &quot;Trigger&quot; reversed course and cleared the area but returned two days later. That day, she sighted a periscope at , and—realizing that instead of hunting, she was being hunted—she slipped away.

On 29 January, the submarine made radar contact from on a large convoy with six escorts and well covered by aircraft. As she closed, the moon came out bright and clear. An enemy bomber turned and started in as radar picked up another plane coming in astern at . The submarine went deep, and the convoy slowly pulled away. The next day, the ship was ordered to terminate her patrol, and she returned to Guam on 3 February.

== Twelfth patrol: March 1945 ==

&quot;Trigger&quot; (with new skipper Commander David R. Connole) stood out to sea on 11 March to begin her 12th war patrol and headed for the Nansei Shoto area. On 18 March, she attacked a convoy west of the islands, sinking the cargo ship &quot;Tsukushi Maru No.3&quot; and damaging another. She reported the attack on 20 March, and the submarine was subsequently ordered to radio as many movements of the convoy as possible to help find a safe passage through a known mined area of the East China Sea. On 24 March, &quot;Trigger&quot; was ordered to begin patrolling west of the islands the next day, outside the curve, and to steer clear of restricted areas. On 26 March, she was ordered to join a wolf pack called &quot;Earl&#x27;s Eliminators&quot; and to acknowledge receipt of the message. A weather report came from the submarine that day but no confirmation of her having received the message. The weather report was &quot;Trigger&quot;″s last transmission. On 4 April, she was ordered to proceed to Midway, but she had not arrived by 1 May and was reported as presumed lost.

Postwar records indicate she torpedoed and sank the repair ship on 27 March. The next day, Japanese planes and ships joined in a two-hour attack on a submarine heard by &quot;Silversides&quot;, , , and in adjacent areas. &quot;Threadfin&quot; was the only one of these submarines attacked that day, and she reported hearing many depth charges and several heavy explosions east of her after the attack on her ceased. Postwar Japanese records showed a Japanese aircraft detected and bombed a submarine on 28 March 1945. &quot;Kaibokan&quot; &quot;Mikura&quot;, &quot;CD-33&quot;, and &quot;CD-59&quot; were then guided to the spot and delivered an intensive depth charging. After two hours, a large oil slick appeared.

&quot;Trigger&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 July 1945.

&quot;Trigger&quot; was immortalized and eulogized in Beach&#x27;s 1952 book &quot;Submarine!&quot;.

Destroyer escort (DE-1056, later FF-1056) was named in honor of Commander David R. Connole.

== Awards ==
&quot;Trigger&quot; received 11 battle stars for World War II service and the Presidential Unit Citation for her fifth, sixth, and seventh war patrols. She is credited with sinking 18 ships (tied with and for seventh on the list of confirmed sinkings by number of ships), totaling 86,552 tons (seventh on the list of confirmed sinkings by tonnage), according to the official JANAC accounting postwar.
===Presidential Unit Citation===

<text>Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, KG (c. 1502 – 1537) was an English nobleman, active as a military officer in the north. He is now primarily remembered as the betrothed of Anne Boleyn, whom he was forced to give up before she became involved with and later married King Henry VIII.

==Early life==
Henry Percy was born about 1502, the eldest son of Henry Algernon Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, by Catherine, daughter of Sir Robert Spencer. Through his mother he was a first cousin of William Carey, who was the brother-in-law to Anne Boleyn.

When quite young, Henry was sent to serve as a page in Thomas Wolsey&#x27;s household. It was a way for young aristocrats to learn about their societies. He was knighted in 1519. The principal source for the early passages of Percy&#x27;s life is the biography of Wolsey by George Cavendish.

==Involvement with Anne Boleyn==
Though his father had planned by 1516 to betroth Percy to Mary Talbot, the daughter of George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, he fell in love with Anne Boleyn, then a young lady about the court. Percy became betrothed to Anne, probably in the spring of 1523 when he was still page to Wolsey. On hearing the news, Wolsey scolded Lord Percy before his household, as permission for the marriage had not been sought from his father nor from the King. The latter had an interest due to the importance of the Northumberland earldom. While Cavendish claimed that the King already had a personal interest in Anne at this point, driving Wolsey&#x27;s angry reaction, this has been debated. The intrigue was soon discovered, and the Earl of Northumberland sent for young Lord Percy.

Besides the proposed Talbot match, another serious obstacle was that Anne was intended to wed James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond (who was then a page in Wolsey&#x27;s household). This match was intended to manage and resolve a dispute over the earldom of Ormond involving Sir Thomas Boleyn, her father, who had a somewhat feeble claim on the vast Ormond estates in Munster through his grandfather.

Another significant reason for Percy&#x27;s father&#x27;s refusal to permit the match was that he believed Anne Boleyn, a mere knight&#x27;s daughter, not a high enough rank for his son and heir.

==Marriage to Mary Talbot==

Percy&#x27;s father reportedly scolded him, saying &quot;thou hast always been a proud, presumptuous, and unthrift waster,&quot; and he was quickly and unhappily married to Lady Mary Talbot, daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury, by early 1524 or in 1525, with earlier legal stages. Starkey dates it at August 1525 or August 1526. The old earl allowed the couple little in the way of comforts or income. Wolsey attempted to insinuate his own servants into the household as a means of controlling the young Henry.

By 1528, only four years into their marriage, the couple&#x27;s relationship had broken down irretrievably. Northumberland suspected his wife of spying on him for Norfolk, while her father worried that the young husband was abusing her and might even poison her. Northumberland was outraged at Shrewsbury&#x27;s suspicions and refused to permit his father-in-law&#x27;s servants to see or speak to his wife. When the countess&#x27;s brother-in-law, William, Lord Dacre, asked the Duke of Norfolk to defend her, Northumberland told Norfolk that he, Northumberland, would never see her again as long as he lived. The couple may have separated shortly thereafter, at least temporarily, since Mary delivered a stillborn child at her father&#x27;s home in April 1529. In 1532, Mary accused her husband of a precontract (i.e. betrothal with legal force) with Anne Boleyn. She confided her alleged grievance to her father, who then mentioned the matter to Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. Anne Boleyn, consulted, ordered an inquiry. Northumberland denied the accusation on oath.

In 1536 Shrewsbury noted his daughter had been living with him for two and half years. At about the same time, Northumberland announced that he was bequeathing his entire inheritance to the King since he had no children, and he and his wife were not likely to have a legitimate heir. He was by then also estranged from his brothers, and did not want them to inherit his property. Mary Talbot hated Henry heartily for the rest of his short life, and later sought a divorce.

==Border warfare==
In July 1522 Northumberland was made a member of the Council of the North; in October he was made deputy warden of the East Marches. His brother-in-law William Dacre suggested that, young as Northumberland was, he should be made warden the same year.
On 19 May 1527 he succeeded his father as sixth Earl of Northumberland; he was made steward of the honour of Holderness on 18 June. On 2 December he became Lord Warden of the East and West Marches.

Northumberland was constantly ill with an ague–a feverish, shivery illness, probably malaria–and was burdened with debt, and yet had to keep up an establishment and engage in fighting on his own account. Cardinal Wolsey treated him in a patronising manner. He was not often allowed to go to court, nor even to his father&#x27;s funeral. His chief friend was Sir Thomas Arundell.

In spite of all this, Northumberland was very active on the borders. He had leave in 1528 to come to London; in 1530, while he was at Topcliffe, he received a message from the king ordering him to go to Cawood and arrest Wolsey. He sent his prisoner south in the custody of Sir Roger Lascelles, while he remained to make an inventory of the Cardinal&#x27;s goods. He was one of the peers who signed the letter to the Pope in July 1530 asking that the divorce might be hurried on, was a friend of Sir Thomas Legh, and possibly was a reformer. On 23 April 1531 he was created Knight of the Garter. On 11 May 1532 he was made High Sheriff of Northumberland for life and on 26 April, a privy councillor.

Northumberland took part in the trial of Lord Thomas Fiennes, 9th Baron Dacre, who at first pleaded ‘not guilty.’ to charges of treason. Dacre, however, was ‘over persuaded.’ He changed his plea to guilty. He must have hoped for, or expected, leniency. The judges and Dacre then tried to get the king&#x27;s mercy. It wasn&#x27;t forthcoming. 
Dacre was executed at Tyburn by hanging, having been given false hope when a stay of execution arrived in the morning. Three other of Dacre&#x27;s party were also executed.

Northumberland was accused of slackness on the borders, and also of having a sword of state carried before him when he went as justiciary to York. If illness was in part responsible, Eustace Chapuys also ranked him, on information which he had from his doctor, among the disaffected early in 1535.

In May 1536 Northumberland, by now a man in broken health, formed one of the jury for the trial of Anne Boleyn. Anne is said to have confessed a precontract with him in the hope of saving her life. He collapsed following the verdict and had to be carried out.

==Later life==
Having no children, Northumberland began to arrange his affairs. In February 1535 he wrote to Thomas Cromwell that he had decided to make the king his heir, a decision he confirmed later. In 1536 he was created Lord President of the Council of the North, and vicegerent of the Order of the Garter.

In September 1536 he had a grant of £1,000 to come to London to make arrangements about his lands. The matter was incomplete when the Pilgrimage of Grace began. Northumberland&#x27;s brothers and mother were open sympathisers with the rebels, but the Earl himself remained loyal to the Crown. The rebel leader Robert Aske and his men came to Wressle Castle, where Percy was ill in bed, and asked him to resign his commands of the marches into the hands of his brothers, or at least go over to the rebels. He refused both requests; and when the lawyer William Stapleton went up to see him, he was in despair. Aske sent him to York, to protect him from his followers, who wanted to behead him.

Northumberland made a grant to the king of his estates, on condition that they pass to his nephew. When, however, his brother, Sir Thomas, was attainted and executed, Northumberland made the grant unconditional in June 1537. By this time his mind was fast failing. He moved to Newington Green, where Richard Layton visited him on 29 June 1537. Layton found him yellow and distended.

Northumberland died on 30 June 1537 and was buried in St Augustin&#x27;s Church, now the site of St John at Hackney parish church. Writing in the early seventeenth century, the antiquarian John Weever recorded Percy&#x27;s original epitaph in the church, which read: &#x27;Here lieth interred, Henry lord Percy, earl of Northumberland, knight of the most honourable order of the Garter, who died in this town the last of June 1537, the 29th of HEN VIII.&#x27; A (presumed Victorian era) memorial plaque was discovered during the 2020 refurbishment of St John at Hackney, and was re-installed inside the church.
==Family==
He married, in 1524, Mary Talbot, daughter of George, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, but left no surviving issue. They did have one known child, stillborn on April 1529 at the home of the earl of Shrewsbury, where Mary had gone to escape her husband. The earldom fell into abeyance on his death, but was revived in favour of his nephew Thomas. His widow lived until 1572. 

Northumberland&#x27;s two brothers, Sir Thomas and Sir Ingelram Percy, took an active part in the management of his estates. They were both leaders of the Pilgrimage of Grace. Both were arrested. Sir Thomas was attainted and executed in 1537. His sons succeeded to the earldom: Thomas as seventh earl and Henry as eighth earl. Sir Ingelram Percy was confined in the Beauchamp Tower, where his name is to be seen cut in the stone. He was soon liberated, went abroad into exile, and died June 30 1537. He left an out-of-wedlock daughter, Isabel, who, in 1544, married Henry Tempest of Broughton.

<text>Hans Robert Hiegel (born 1954) is a German architect.

==Career==
Hiegel was born in Kaiserslautern. He lived in London until 1978 and his first work was &quot;House Agne&quot;, 1983. Succeeding projects tend to a classical architectural style. Important articles include &quot;Werkheft04&quot; (), and by Thilo Hilpert in the Frankfurt Lounge, first published in the Japanese architectural journal A+U, Tokyo.
He studied architecture at the University of Karlsruhe and at the Architectural Association (AA), together with Steven Holl. His teaching locations include the AA, the HfG Karlsruhe and the Bezalel Academy, Jerusalem.

==Work==
In 1983, he designed the project Campanile in Frankfurt am Main, which turned out to be most influential on the Messeturm. 
Personal contacts to Joseph Rykwert who introduced him to the work and the person of Hans-Georg Gadamer were seminal to his philosophy and his thinking. &quot;Oase&quot; is the name of his prizewinning design for a Kindergarten near Baden-Baden which continues his quest for classical positions in architectural language.

<doc id="429149" wikidata="Q187704" url="?curid=429149" title="Nutria">
<text>The nutria () or coypu () (Myocastor coypus) is a herbivorous, semiaquatic rodent from South America.
Classified for a long time as the only member of the family Myocastoridae, &quot;Myocastor&quot; has since been included within Echimyidae, the family of the spiny rats.
The nutria lives in burrows alongside stretches of water and feeds on river plant stems. Originally native to subtropical and temperate South America, it was introduced to North America, Europe and Asia, primarily by fur farmers. Although it is still hunted and trapped for its fur in some regions, its destructive burrowing and feeding habits often bring it into conflict with humans, and it is considered an invasive species in the United States. Nutria also transmit various diseases to humans and animals, mainly through water contamination.

== Etymology ==
The genus name &quot;Myocastor&quot; derives from the two Ancient Greek words () &#x27;rat, mouse&#x27;, and () &#x27;beaver&#x27;. Therefore, the name &quot;Myocastor&quot; literally means &#x27;mouse beaver&#x27;.

Two names are commonly used in English for &quot;Myocastor coypus&quot;. The name &quot;nutria&quot; (from the Spanish word &quot;nutria&quot; &#x27;otter&#x27;) is generally used in North America, Asia, and throughout countries of the former Soviet Union; however, in most Spanish-speaking countries, the word &quot;nutria&quot; refers primarily to the otter. To avoid this ambiguity, the name &quot;coypu&quot; or &quot;coipo&quot; (derived from Mapudungun) is used in South America, Britain and other parts of Europe. In France, the nutria is known as a &quot;ragondin&quot;. In Dutch, it is known as &quot;beverrat&quot; &#x27;beaver rat&#x27;. In German, it is known as &quot;Nutria&quot;, &quot;Biberratte&quot; &#x27;beaver rat&#x27;, or &quot;Sumpfbiber&quot; &#x27;swamp beaver&#x27;. In Italy, instead, the popular name is, as in North America and Asia, &quot;nutria&quot;, but it is also called &quot;castorino&quot; &#x27;little beaver&#x27;, by which its fur is known in Italy. In Swedish, the animal is known as &quot;sumpbäver&quot; &#x27;marsh/swamp beaver&#x27;. In Brazil, the animal is known as &quot;ratão-do-banhado&quot; &#x27;big swamp rat&#x27;, &quot;nútria&quot;, or &quot;caxingui&quot; (the last from Tupi).

== Taxonomy ==

The nutria was first described by Juan Ignacio Molina in 1782 as &quot;Mus coypus&quot;, a member of the mouse genus. The genus &quot;Myocastor&quot; was assigned in 1792 by Robert Kerr. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, independently of Kerr, named the species &quot;Myopotamus coypus&quot;, and it is occasionally referred to by this name.

Four subspecies are generally recognized:
*&quot;M. c. bonariensis&quot;: northern Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Brazil (RS, SC, PR, and SP)
*&quot;M. c. coypus&quot;: central Chile, Bolivia
*&quot;M. c. melanops&quot;: Chiloé Island
*&quot;M. c. santacruzae&quot;: Patagonia

&quot;M. c. bonariensis&quot;, the subspecies present in the northernmost (subtropical) part of the nutria&#x27;s range, is believed to be the type of nutria most commonly introduced to other continents.

== Phylogeny ==
Comparison of DNA and protein sequences showed that the genus &quot;Myocastor&quot; is the sister group to the genus &quot;Callistomys&quot; (painted tree-rats). In turn, these two taxa share evolutionary affinities with other Myocastorini genera: &quot;Proechimys&quot; and &quot;Hoplomys&quot; (armored rats) on the one hand, and &quot;Thrichomys&quot; on the other hand.

== Appearance ==

The nutria somewhat resembles a very large rat, or a beaver with a small, long and skinny hairless tail. Adults are typically in weight, and in body length, with a tail. It is possible for nutria to weigh up to , although adults usually average . Nutria have three sets of fur. The guard hairs on the outer coat are three inches long. They have coarse, darkish brown midlayer fur with soft dense grey under fur, also called the nutria. Three distinguishing features are a white patch on the muzzle, webbed hind feet, and large, bright orange-yellow incisors. They have approximately 20 teeth with four large incisors that grow during the entirety of their lives. The orange discoloration is due to pigment staining from the mineral iron in the tooth enamel. Nutria have prominent four inch long whiskers on each side of their muzzle or cheek area. The mammary glands and teats of female nutria are high on her flanks, to allow their young to feed while the female is in the water. There is no visible distinction between male and female nutria. Both are similar in coloring and weight.

A nutria is often mistaken for a muskrat (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;), another widely dispersed, semiaquatic rodent that occupies the same wetland habitats. The muskrat, however, is smaller and more tolerant of cold climates, and has a laterally flattened tail it uses to assist in swimming, whereas the tail of a nutria is round. It can also be mistaken for a small beaver, as beavers and nutria have very similar anatomies and habitats. However, beavers&#x27; tails are flat and paddle-like, as opposed to the round tails of nutria.

==Life history==
Nutria can live up to six years in captivity, but individuals rarely live past three years old in the wild. According to one study, 80% of nutrias die within the first year, and less than 15% of a wild population is over 3 years old. A nutria is considered to have reached old age at 4 years old. Male nutria reach sexual maturity as early as four months, and females as early as three months; however, both can have a prolonged adolescence, up to the age of nine months. Once a female is pregnant, gestation lasts 130 days, and she may give birth to as few as one or as many as 13 offspring. The average nutria reproduction is four offspring. Female nutria will mate within two days after offspring are born. The years of reproduction cycle by litter size. Year one might be large, year two litter size will be smaller and year three the litter size will be another larger size. Females can only produce six litters in her life, rarely seven litters. A female on average will have two litters a year.

Nutria generally line nursery nests with grasses and soft reeds. Baby nutria are precocial, born fully furred and with open eyes; they can eat vegetation and swim with their parents within hours of birth. A female nutria can become pregnant again the day after she gives birth to her young. If timed properly, a female can become pregnant three times within a year. Newborn nutria nurse for seven to eight weeks, after which they leave their mothers. Nutria have been known to be territorial and aggressive when caught or cornered. They will bite and attack humans and dogs when threatened. Nutria are mainly crepuscular or nocturnal, with most activity occurring around dusk and sunset with highest activity around midnight. When food is scarce, nutria will forage during the day. When food is plentiful, nutria will rest and groom during the day.

== Distribution ==
Native to subtropical and temperate South America, its range includes Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and the southern parts of Brazil and Bolivia. It has been introduced to North America, Europe and Asia, primarily by fur ranchers.
The distribution of nutrias outside South America tends to contract or expand with successive cold or mild winters. During cold winters, nutria often suffer frostbite on their tails, leading to infection or death. As a result, populations of nutria often contract and even become locally or regionally extinct as in the Scandinavian countries and such US states as Idaho, Montana, and Nebraska during the 1980s. During mild winters, their ranges tend to expand northward. For example, in recent years, range expansions have been noted in Washington and Oregon, as well as Delaware.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, nutria were first introduced to the United States in California, in 1899 by William Franklin Frakes. , they had spread to the San Francisco Bay Area, where their digging threatened storm levees, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife had an active eradication program.

They were first brought to Louisiana in the early 1930s for the fur industry, and the population was kept in check, or at a small population size, because of trapping pressure from the fur traders. The earliest account of nutria spreading freely into Louisiana wetlands from their enclosures was in the early 1940s; a hurricane hit the Louisiana coast for which many people were unprepared, and the storm destroyed the enclosures, enabling the nutria to escape into the wild. According to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, nutria were also transplanted from Port Arthur, Texas, to the Mississippi River in 1941 and then spread due to a hurricane later that year.

==Habitat and feeding==
Besides breeding quickly, each nutria consumes large amounts of aquatic vegetation. An individual consumes about 25% of its body weight daily, and feeds year-round. Being one of the world&#x27;s larger extant rodents, a mature, healthy nutria averages in weight, but they can reach as much as . They eat the base of the above-ground stems of plants, and often dig through soil for roots and rhizomes to eat. Nutria eat parts and whole plants, and go after roots, rhizomes, tubers and black willow tree bark in the winter. Their creation of &quot;eat-outs&quot;, areas where a majority of the above- and below-ground biomass has been removed, produces patches in the environment, which in turn disrupts the habitat for other animals and humans dependent on wetlands and marshes. Nutria eat the following plant varieties: cattail, rushes, reeds, arrowheads, flatsedges, and cordgrasses. Commercial crops that nutria also eat are lawn grasses, alfalfa, corn, rice, and sugarcane.

Nutria are found most commonly in freshwater marshes and wetlands, but also inhabit brackish marshes and rarely salt marshes. They either construct their own burrows, or occupy burrows abandoned by beaver, muskrats, or other animals. They are also capable of constructing floating rafts out of vegetation. Nutria live in partially underwater dens. The main chamber is not submerged underground. Nutria are considered to be a species that lives in colonies. One male will share a den with three or four females and their offspring. Nutria use &quot;feeding platforms&quot; which are constructed in the water from cut pieces of vegetation supported by a structure like a log or branches. Muskrat dens and beaver lodges are also often used as feeding platforms.

==Commercial use and issues==
=== Farming and the fur trade ===
Local extinction in their native range due to overharvesting led to the development of nutria fur farms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The first farms were in Argentina and then later in Europe, North America, and Asia. These farms have generally not been successful long-term investments, and farmed nutria often are released or escape as operations become unprofitable. The first attempt at nutria farming was in France in the early 1880s, but it was not much of a success. The first efficient and extensive nutria farms were located in South America in the 1920s. The South American farms were very successful, and led to the growth of similar farms in North America and Europe. Nutrias from these farms often escaped, or were deliberately released into the wild to provide a game animal or to remove aquatic vegetation.

Nutria were introduced to the Louisiana ecosystem in the 1930s, when they escaped from fur farms that had imported them from South America. Nutria were released into the wild by at least one Louisiana nutria farmer in 1933 and these releases were followed by E. A. McIlhenny who released his entire stock in 1945 on Avery Island. In 1940, some of the nutria escaped during a hurricane and quickly populated coastal marshes, inland swamps, and other wetland areas. From Louisiana, nutria have spread across the Southern United States, wreaking havoc on marshlands.

Following a decline in demand for nutria fur, nutria have since become pests in many areas, destroying aquatic vegetation, marshes, and irrigation systems, and chewing through man-made items such as tires and wooden house panelling in Louisiana, eroding river banks, and displacing native animals. Damage in Louisiana has been sufficiently severe since the 1950s to warrant legislative attention; in 1958, the first bounty was placed on nutria, though this effort was not funded. By the early 2000s, the Coastwide Nutria Control Program was established, which began paying bounties for nutria killed in 2002. In the Chesapeake Bay region in Maryland, where they were introduced in the 1940s, nutria are believed to have destroyed of marshland in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. In response, by 2003, a multimillion-dollar eradication program was underway.

In the United Kingdom, nutria were introduced to East Anglia, for fur, in 1929; many escaped and damaged the drainage works, and a concerted programme by MAFF eradicated them by 1989. 

=== Food products ===
A small number of game meat websites on the internet sell nutria meat for consumption. As of 2016, at least one Moscow restaurant serves nutria meat dishes. In 1997 and 1998, Louisiana attempted to encourage the public to consume nutria meat. Nutria meat is leaner with a lower fat content and lower in cholesterol compared to ground beef. In an effort to encourage Louisianians to eat nutria, several recipes were distributed to locals and published on the internet. People in poor and rural Louisiana have trapped and consumed nutria meat for decades.

Marsh Dog, a US company based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, received a grant from the Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program to establish a company that uses nutria meat for dog food products. In 2012, the Louisiana Wildlife Federation recognized Marsh Dog with &quot;Business Conservationist of the Year&quot; award for finding a use for this eco-sustainable protein. A claimed environmentally sound solution is the use of nutria meat to make dog food treats.

In Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, nutria (Russian and local languages Нутрия) are farmed on private plots and sold in local markets as a poor man&#x27;s meat. As of 2016, however, the meat is used successfully in Moscow restaurant Krasnodar Bistro, as part of the growing Russian localvore movement and as a &#x27;foodie&#x27; craze. It appears on the menu as a burger, hotdog, dumplings, or wrapped in cabbage leaves, with the flavour being somewhere between turkey and pork.

== Ecological impacts ==
=== Herbivory and habitat degradation ===
Nutria herbivory &quot;severely reduces overall wetland biomass and can lead to the conversion of wetland to open water.&quot; Unlike other common disturbances in marshlands, such as fire and tropical storms, which are a once- or few-times-a-year occurrence, nutria feed year round, so their effects on the marsh are constant. Also, nutria are typically more destructive in the winter than in the growing season, due largely to the scarcity of above-ground vegetation; as nutria search for food, they dig up root networks and rhizomes for food. 

While nutria are the most common herbivores in Louisiana marshes, they are not the only ones. Feral hogs, also known as wild boars (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), swamp rabbits (&quot;Sylvilagus aquaticus&quot;), and muskrats (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;) are less common, but feral hogs are increasing in number in Louisiana wetlands. On plots open to nutria herbivory, 40% less vegetation was found than in plots guarded against nutria by fences. This number may seem insignificant, and indeed herbivory alone is not a serious cause of land loss, but when herbivory was combined with an additional disturbance, such as fire, single vegetation removal, or double vegetation removal to simulate a tropical storm, the effect of the disturbances on the vegetation were greatly amplified. 

As different factors were added together, they resulted in less overall vegetation. Adding fertilizer to open plots did not promote plant growth; instead, nutria fed more in the fertilized areas. Increasing fertilizer inputs in marshes only increases nutria biomass instead of the intended vegetation, therefore increasing nutrient input is not recommended. The problem became so serious that Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish used SWAT sharpshooters against the animals.

Wetlands in general are a valuable resource both economically and environmentally. For instance, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined wetlands covered only 5% of the land surface of the contiguous 48 United States, but they support 31% of the nation&#x27;s plant species. These very biodiverse systems provide resources, shelter, nesting sites, and resting sites (particularly Louisiana&#x27;s coastal wetlands such as Grand Isle for migratory birds) to a wide array of wildlife. Human users also receive many benefits from wetlands, such as cleaner water, storm surge protection, oil and gas resources (especially on the Gulf Coast), reduced flooding, and chemical and biological waste reduction, to name a few. In Louisiana, rapid wetland loss occurs due to a variety of reasons; this state loses an estimated area about the size of a football field every hour.

In 1998, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) conducted the first Louisiana coast-wide survey, which was funded by the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act and titled the Nutria Harvest and Wetland Demonstration Program, to evaluate the condition of the marshlands. The survey revealed through aerial surveys of transects that herbivory damage to wetlands totaled roughly . The next year, LDWF performed the same survey and found the area damaged by herbivory increased to about . The LDWF has determined the wetlands affected by nutria decreased from an estimated minimum of of Louisiana wetlands in 2002–2003 season to about during the 2010–2011 season. The LDWF stresses that coastal wetland restoration projects will be greatly hindered without effective, sustainable nutria population control.

=== Pathogenic and viral reservoirs of zoonotic diseases ===
In addition to direct environmental damage, nutria are the host for a roundworm nematode parasite () that can infect the skin of humans, causing dermatitis similar to strongyloidiasis. The condition is also called &quot;nutria itch&quot;. Other parasites they can host are tapeworms, liver flukes, and blood flukes. Waterbody contamination by nutria occurs through urine and feces. Nutria also host fleas, ticks and chewing louse. They can carry several zoonotic diseases (diseases transmitted from animals to humans). They are reservoirs for salmonellosis, encephalomyocarditis virus, chlamydia psittaci and antibiotic resistant bacteria, Aeromonas spp. Other zoonotic disease of concern they are host reservoirs for are mycobacterium tuberculosis, septicemia, toxoplasmosis, and rickettsiosis. According to the CDC, nutria carry two out of eight diseases of concern for the United States, rabies and salmonellosis. Nutria are considered a global alien species and have potential to spread disease to livestock and humans. Nutria are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Native to the southern hemisphere and spreading globally requires preventive monitoring for zoonotic disease transmission. Nutria immigration is monitored for habitat destruction of wetlands, farmlands, marshes and is measured in habitat loss in acres. Increased local awareness of viral, bacterial and parasitic transmission from nutria to humans and livestock will be of greater importance as climate change progresses.

==Control efforts==
As a global alien species, nutria are monitored and managed throughout the world. Many countries have attempted eradication efforts with varying degrees of success.

Nutria are predicted to expand their range northward over the next century as global temperatures increase.

=== European Union ===
This species is included since 2016 in the EU list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This implies that this species cannot be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.

==== Ireland ====
A nutria was first sighted in the wild in Ireland in 2010. Some nutria escaped from a pet farm in Cork City in 2015 and began breeding on the outskirts of the city. Ten were trapped on the Curraheen River in 2017, but the rodents continued to spread, reaching Dublin via the Royal Canal in 2019. Animals were found along the River Mulkear in 2015. The National Biodiversity Data Centre issued a species alert in 2017, saying that nutria &quot;[have] the potential to be a high impact invasive species in Ireland. […] This species is listed as among 100 of the worst invasive species in Europe.&quot;

=== Great Britain===
In the UK, nutria escaped from fur farms and were reported in the wild as early as 1932. There were three unsuccessful attempts to control nutria in East Anglia between 1943 and 1944. Nutria population and range increased, causing damage to agriculture in the 1950s. During the 1960s, a grant was awarded to rabbit clearance societies that included nutria. This control allowed for the removal of 97,000 nutria in 1961 and 1962. From 1962 to 1965, 12 trappers were hired to eradicate as many nutria as possible confining the remaining population within the Norfolk Broads. The campaign used live traps allowing non-target species to be released while any nutria caught were shot. Combined with cold winters in 1962 to 1963, almost 40,500 nutria were removed from the population. Although nutria populations were greatly reduced after the 1962–1965 campaign ended, the population increased until another eradication campaign began in 1981. This campaign succeeded in fully eradicating nutria in Great Britain. The trapping areas were broken into eight sectors leaving no area uncontrolled. The 24 trappers were offered an incentive for early completion of the 10-year campaign. In 1989 nutria were assumed eradicated, as only three males were found between 1987 and 1989.

=== Japan ===
Nutria were introduced to Japan in 1939. They were imported from France during World War II to support food shortages as well as the fur trade. After the war in 1950, many nutria were released en masse or escaped, and became one of Japan&#x27;s worst invasive species, damaging river banks, rice fields and other valuable crops. In 1963 an eradication program was started to remove nutria but has shown little to no success. Nutria are still present in Japan and there is a restriction on importing, transporting and obtaining nutria per the Invasive Alien Species Act established in 2004.

===New Zealand===
Nutria are classed as a &quot;prohibited new organism&quot; under New Zealand&#x27;s Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing it from being imported into the country.

===United States===
====Atlantic Coast====
An eradication program on the Delmarva Peninsula, between Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Coast, where nutria once numbered in the tens of thousands and had destroyed thousands of hectares of marshland, had nearly succeeded by 2012. In September 2022 government officials announced that nutria have been completely eradicated on the Maryland Eastern Shore.

====California====
The first records of nutria invading California dates from the 1940s and 1950s, when the species was found in the agriculture-rich Central Valley and the south coast of the state, but by the 1970s the animals had been statewide. They were found again in Merced County in 2017, on the edge of the San Joaquin River Delta. State officials are concerned that they will harm infrastructure that sends water to San Joaquin Valley farms and urban areas. In 2019, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) received nearly $2 million in Governor Gavin Newsom&#x27;s first budget, and an additional $8.5 million via the Delta Conservancy (a state agency focused on the Delta) to be spent over the course of three years. The state has adopted an eradication campaign based on the successful effort in the Chesapeake Bay, including strategies such as the &quot;Judas nutria&quot; (in which individualized nutria are caught, sterilized, fitted with radio collars, and released, whereupon they can be tracked by hunters as they return to their colonies) and the use of trained dogs. The state has also reversed a prior &quot;no-hunting&quot; policy, although hunting the animals does require a license. California has a restriction on importation and transportation without a permit. If nutria are found or captured in the state of California, local authorities must be notified right away and the nutria cannot be released. Licensed hunters in the state of California may hunt nutria as a non-game animal. Bounty programs are not advised in California due to native species of muskrat and beaver being misidentified.

====Louisiana====
The Louisiana Coastwide Nutria Control Program provides incentives for harvesting nutria. Starting in 2002, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) performed aerial surveys just as they had done for the Nutria Harvest and Wetland Demonstration Program, except under a different program title. Under the Coastwide Nutria Control Program, which also receives funds from CWPPRA, 308,160 nutria were harvested the first year (2002–2003), revealing damage and totaling $1,232,640 in incentive payouts to those legally participating in the program. Essentially, once a person receives a license to hunt or trap nutria, that person is allowed to capture an unlimited number. When a nutria is captured, the tail is cut off and turned in to a Coastal Environments Inc. (CEI) official at an approved site. As of 2019, each nutria tail is worth $6, which is an increase from $4 before the 2006–2007 season. Nutria harvesting increased drastically during the 2009–2010 season, with 445,963 nutria tails turned in worth $2,229,815 in incentive payments. Each CEI official keeps record of how many tails have been turned in by each individual per parish, the method used in capture of the nutria, and the location of capture. All of this information is transferred to a database to calculate the density of nutria across the Louisiana coast, and the LDWF combines these data with the results from the aerial surveys to determine the number of nutria remaining in the marshes and the amount of damage they are inflicting on the ecosystem.

Another program executed by LDWF involves creating a market of nutria meat for human consumption, though it is still trying to gain public notice. Nutria is a very lean, protein-rich meat, low in fat and cholesterol with the taste, texture, and appearance of rabbit or dark turkey meat. Few pathogens are associated with the meat, but proper heating when cooking should kill them. The quality of the meat and the minimal harmful microorganisms associated with it make nutria meat an &quot;excellent food product for export markets&quot;.

Several desirable control methods are ineffective for various reasons. Zinc phosphide is the only rodenticide registered to control nutria, but it is expensive, remains toxic for months, detoxifies in high humidity and rain, and requires construction of expensive floating rafts for placement of the chemical. It is not yet sure how many nontarget species are susceptible to zinc phosphide, but birds and rabbits have been known to die from ingestion. Therefore, this chemical is rarely used, especially not in large-scale projects. Other potential chemical pesticides would be required by the US Environmental Protection Agency to undergo vigorous testing before being acceptable to use on nutria. The LDWF has estimated costs for new chemicals to be $300,000 for laboratory, chemistry, and field studies, and $500,000 for a mandatory Environmental Impact Statement. Contraception is not a common form of control, but is preferred by some wildlife managers. It is also expensive to operate– an estimated $6 million annually to drop bait laced with birth-control chemicals. Testing of other potential contraceptives would take about five to eight years and $10 million, with no guarantee of FDA approval. Also, an intensive environmental assessment would have to be completed to determine whether any non-target organisms were affected by the contraceptive chemicals. Neither of these control methods is likely to be used in the near future.

In Louisiana, a claimed environmentally sound solution is the killing of nutria to make dog food treats.

<text>Knock First is an American reality television series in which an adolescent is chosen for a total room makeover by the Knock First crew. The series first aired in October 2003 on ABC Family.

The premise of the show was to shape the room in which the teenager lives into a space that represents them better. Teenagers who had been living in the same room since they were toddlers are able to redesign the room according to their desires. The series included four designers: Taniya Nayak, John Gidding, Kathy Kuo, Shane Booth, and two carpenters: Carrie Roy and Andy Hampton.

The first season of Knock First centered mainly around teenagers in and around the Northeast, whereas the second season expanded to homes in California, to a slightly older audience.

The show theme for the first season was titled &quot;(This Is The Way) I Am&quot;, and was written and produced by Widelife, also creators of the theme for Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Queer Eye&quot;, and performed by Faith Trent. The show theme for the second season was titled &quot;Bring it to Life,&quot; written and performed by Kat Meoz.

The show was supposed to be redesigned for its third season, but was canceled after two seasons instead.

<doc id="429154" wikidata="Q860490" url="?curid=429154" title="Bilateralism">
<text>Bilateralism is the conduct of political, economic, or cultural relations between two sovereign states. It is in contrast to unilateralism or multilateralism, which is activity by a single state or jointly by multiple states, respectively. When states recognize one another as sovereign states and agree to diplomatic relations, they create a bilateral relationship. States with bilateral ties will exchange diplomatic agents such as ambassadors to facilitate dialogues and cooperations.

Economic agreements, such as free trade agreements (FTAs) or foreign direct investment (FDI), signed by two states, are a common example of bilateralism. Since most economic agreements are signed according to the specific characteristics of the contracting countries to give preferential treatment to each other, not a generalized principle but a situational differentiation is needed. Thus through bilateralism, states can obtain more tailored agreements and obligations that only apply to particular contracting states. However, the states will face a trade-off because it is more wasteful in transaction costs than the multilateral strategy. In a bilateral strategy, a new contract has to be negotiated for each participant. So it tends to be preferred when transaction costs are low and the member surplus, which corresponds to &quot;producer surplus&quot; in economic terms, is high. Moreover, this will be effective if an influential state wants control over small states from a liberalism perspective, because building a series of bilateral arrangements with small states can increase a state&#x27;s influence.

==Examples==
* Australia and Canada have a bilateral relationship; both have similar governments and share similar values as well as having the same titular head of state. In 1895 the Government of Canada sent John Larke to Sydney to establish a trade commission and in 1935 Canada sent Charles Burchell (Australia&#x27;s first Canadian High Commissioner) to formalise ties between the two countries. Both nations have been wartime allies, and their trade and economic relations are strong.
* India and Nepal have had a bilateral relationship since ancient times even before the birth of the Buddha in 563 BC. In modern times, this traditional relationship has been confirmed by written treaties. The India-Nepal treaty of friendship was signed in July 1950. That provided economically and politically important effects for both countries. In 2011, the two countries signed a new Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement. These bilateral treaties have played a significant role in the evolution of international investment law. Citizens of both countries can move across the border freely without passport or visa, live and work in either country and own property and business in either country. Gurkhas form a part of the Indian Army. Millions of Nepalis have been living in India for long periods of time.
* The United States has bilateral relationships with several East Asian countries, particularly South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. The United States formed a bilateral alliance with Japan during the Security Treaty between the United States and Japan. The U.S. also formed a bilateral alliance with Korea during the 1953 U.S.–South Korea Status of Forces Agreement and one with the Republic of China during the 1954 Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty. Unlike its relationship with European nations which takes multilateral alliances centered in NATO, the U.S. prefers a direct relationship with each of the East Asian countries. Rather than establishing a security alliance or hosting a summit, the U.S. tends to make a direct connection with each nation. From both historical and political perspectives, every country in the East Asian region can be an opponent or a target to any other. Therefore, it is comparatively difficult to construct multilateral alliances, which depend upon mutual reliance. A main U.S. reason for choosing a bilateral treaty was to avoid conflict, as might have been the case with multilateral treaties (e.g. risk of multilateral treaty defects). An example is the &quot;hub and spokes&quot; reference, where the U.S. is the &quot;hub&quot; and the East Asian countries are the &quot;spokes&quot;; they each have a connection with the U.S. but not with each other.
** There are multiple factors that are unique when discussing why the United States has chosen to form bilateral relations particularly with East Asian countries, in comparison to the multilateral relations, such as NATO. Firstly, the United States had existing and longer relations with countries in Europe. Thus it was easier for the United States to build and form this multilateral bond. Victor Cha states &quot;Acheson argued that NATO was the product of a long, deliberative process, that West European powers had carefully developed their plan for collective defense before asking for U.S. help, and most revealing, that the United States viewed NATO as a mutual collective defense arrangement.&quot; Another factor which contributed is the geography of East Asia compared to Europe. Because Europe is &quot;connected&quot;, it is better for the security and economy. Whereas in East Asia, states are divided over a large space and is separated by large amounts of water and distance, making it a less admirable condition to form multilateral bonds for the United States. In East Asia, there are also a variety of regimes: communist, authoritarian regimes as well as democratic regimes. In comparison to the states in NATO, who are consisted of democracies, causing a level of difficulty in creating multilateral relations. Another factor is that the states in NATO recognised the same source of threat, which was USSR. This allowed for an agreement amongst these NATO states to form this multilateral relation. However, in the case with East Asia, there was no unified threat. For the ROC (Republic of China, otherwise known as Taiwan), China was seen as the threat. For the ROK (Republic of Korea, otherwise known as South Korea), DPRK (Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, otherwise known as North Korea) was the threat. Thus there was a great level of difficulty in the United States forming an alliance with East Asia as the threats were different. Among many of the different explanations behind the United States&#x27; choice of intervening in the bilateral alliances in East Asia, some social historians added that the U.S. decision makers firmly believed that unlike Europe, &quot;inferior&quot; Asians presumably did not possess the level of sophistication and responsibility that was required for the complex organization of the multilateral security arrangements. Christopher Hemmer and Peter J. Katzenstein concluded, &quot;trust [was] absent, religion and domestic value were shared in only few cases, and race invoked as a powerful force separating the U.S. from Asia&quot;.
** Victor Cha proposed the Powerplay theory in his article &quot;Powerplay: Origins of the U.S. Alliance System in Asia&quot;, which explains the reasons behind the United States&#x27; decision in creating a series of bilateral alliances with East Asian countries. Powerplay is commonly used in any political or social situation when one uses its knowledge or information against others in order to gain benefits using situational advantages the one has. According to the powerplay theory, the alliances were created to both contain and constrain potential rogue allies (rogue state) from performing aggressive behavior that would trigger larger military conflict and involvement. The rogue allies (rogue states) include Taiwan&#x27;s Kai Shek Chiang, who was publicly planning and looking forward to take back mainland China, and Korea&#x27;s Syngman Rhee, who wanted to unify the Korean peninsula. The United States was also worried that Japan would recover its regional power in Asia. Cha concludes that the postwar United States planners had selected such a type of security architecture as an attempt to prevent aggression by the East Asian pro-west dictators and to increase leverage and states&#x27; dependency on the U.S. economy. 
** The U.S.–Japan alliance was a bilateral security order created with the intention of preventing the expansion of Soviet power and communism in the Asia Pacific. The U.S. provided Japan, and the other Asia Pacific countries, with the offer of security protection and access to American markets, technology, and supplies in exchange for providing diplomatic, economic, and logistical support for the U.S., as this, according to John Ikenberry, would lead to the &quot;wider, American-centered anti-Communist postwar order&quot;.
* The United States also has a history of bilateral agreements with Panama, beginning with the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty (1903) which established the United States&#x27; right to build a canal and own it and adjacent property across the otherwise-sovereign nation of Panama. This was replaced by the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal and the Panama Canal Treaty (both signed 1977). A bilateral investment treaty amendment was signed by the two countries in 2000, and several more limited agreements have been signed between various law-enforcement and financial agencies of the two countries.

==History==
There has been a long debate on the merits of bilateralism versus multilateralism. The first rejection of bilateralism came after the First World War when many politicians concluded that the complex pre-war system of bilateral treaties had made war inevitable. This led to the creation of the multilateral League of Nations (which was disbanded in failure after 26 years).

A similar reaction against bilateral trade agreements occurred after the Great Depression, when it was argued that such agreements helped produce a cycle of rising tariffs that deepened the economic downturn. Thus, after the Second World War, the West turned to multilateral agreements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

Despite the high profile of modern multilateral systems such as the United Nations and World Trade Organization, most diplomacy is still done at the bilateral level. Bilateralism has a flexibility and ease lacking in most compromise-dependent multilateral systems. In addition, disparities in power, resources, money, armament, or technology are more easily exploitable by the stronger side in bilateral diplomacy, which powerful states might consider as a positive aspect of it, compared to the more consensus-driven multilateral form of diplomacy, where the one state-one vote rule applies.

A 2017 study found that bilateral tax treaties, even if intended to &quot;coordinate policies between countries to avoid double taxation and encourage international investment&quot;, had the unintended consequence of allowing &quot;multinationals to engage in treaty shopping, states&#x27; fiscal autonomy is limited, and governments tend to maintain lower tax rates.&quot;

<text>Last Comic Standing is an American reality television talent competition show on NBC that aired from June 1, 2003, to August 9, 2010, and again in 2014 and 2015. Each season a comedian from an initially large group of hopefuls was picked as a winner. For the first seven seasons, the winner received a cash prize and a television special; for season eight in 2014, the winner won a cash prize, a talent deal with NBC, and a half-hour scripted project developed by Universal Television.

==Format==
The show varied its format season by season. For seasons 1–2 and 4–7, NBC talent scouts Ross Mark and Bob Read held open casting calls in various locations around the United States. At each casting call, Mark and Read selected comics to participate in callback auditions in front of live audiences. Mark and Read selected a predetermined number of comics from each callback, who were invited to participate in a semifinal qualifying round.

The comics who advanced to the semifinal qualifying round were divided into two groups. In Season Four, 40 comics were divided into two groups of 20; the comics performed competing against each other at the Alex Theatre in Glendale, California. During the semifinal qualifying rounds, a panel of celebrity judges, and the show&#x27;s producers, selected the finalists who would move forward to the final qualifying round, and live together in a group residence.

Once the residence finalists were selected, the comics participated in some type of comedic challenge each television week. Challenges included performing stand-up at a local laundromat, working as a tour guide in Los Angeles, participating in a roast at the Friars Club of Beverly Hills, and performing comedy related to a specific subject with little preparation time on a radio show. Usually the winner of each challenge is rewarded with immunity from being eliminated from the competition for that week; the remaining comics are vulnerable to elimination during a &quot;head-to-head&quot; standup challenge.

As the conclusion of each television week drew near, each comic selected one other comic whom they believed they could defeat in a head-to-head challenge. The comics were sent off individually to a secluded booth, and named the person selected using the phrase &quot;I know I&#x27;m funnier than _____.&quot; The comic who received the most nominations participated in that evening&#x27;s head-to-head competition, and selected their opponent from any of the comics who had challenged them.

The head-to-head competition occurs in front of a live studio audience. For the first seven seasons, the studio audience voted electronically for their preferred performer, while in the eighth season the judges always selected the winner. The winning comic remains &quot;in the house&quot;, while the losing comic is eliminated from the competition.

For the first seven seasons, when only five comics remained, the format changed again. All remaining comics performed for a large theatre audience as before, but now the decision-making power shifted from the studio audience to the television audience. Viewers cast their votes for their favorite comic by calling a specific number, by voting online at the network&#x27;s website, or both. Unlike some other &quot;audience-vote reality&quot; programs, the producers imposed a maximum number of eligible votes per originating phone number and email address. The comic receiving the lowest number of votes each week was eliminated from the competition, until there was only the &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;.

The &quot;in the house&quot; concept was dropped for season 7, and each week consisted of all remaining comics performing in front of a theater audience and being voted on by the television viewers to determine who leaves and who remains. It was essentially identical to the &quot;final five&quot; format used previously.

The 3rd season was also unique in that it pitted the contestants of the first two seasons against one another.

==Seasons==

===Season 1 (2003)===
Season one aired in the summer of 2003 and was hosted by Jay Mohr. The winner of the audience-participation final vote in season one was Dat Phan, with 35% of the vote. Other finalists included Ralphie May (28%), Rich Vos (18%), Cory Kahaney (12%), and Tess (7%). Contestants &quot;in the house&quot; who did not make the final five were Geoff Brown, Tere Joyce, Sean Kent, Dave Mordal, and Rob Cantrell.

The other finalists were Ant, Tammy Pescatelli, Bonnie McFarlane, Jay London, Kathleen Madigan, Todd Glass, Chris Voth, and Corey Holcomb.

Buck Star, who became infamous for appearing at every &quot;LCS&quot; audition, first appeared in season two. After being repeatedly rejected by talent scouts Mark and Read, Mark acquiesced, allowing Buck to perform in the callback auditions in Tampa, Florida (the final audition site of the season). Buck failed to impress the live audience, however, and did not advance further in the competition.

After five head-to-head eliminations, a wildcard competition was set up among the five eliminated comics the top voter-getting returning to the competition. Jay London won this competition, but was ultimately eliminated again in the next vote.

===Season 3 (2004)===
While Season 2 was still airing, NBC agreed to produce a third season, which would air during the fall of 2004. Season three, dubbed the &quot;Battle of the Best&quot;, consisted of a competition between the final ten comedians from seasons one and two. The grand prize awarded for the season was only $250,000 (unlike previous seasons&#x27; prizes which included a talent contract and a television special). Alonzo Bodden, the runner-up from Season 2, was the winner and Dave Mordal, the seventh place man from Season 1, was the runner-up. The third place men were John Heffron, the Season 2 winner and Rich Vos, the third place man from Season 1 and Bonnie McFarlane&#x27;s husband. Season 2&#x27;s first-eliminated Bonnie McFarlane chose not to participate in this season for unspecified reasons. She was replaced by a finalists judge competition of four comics who made it to the Hawaii round; the winner of that competition was Jessica Kirson, who was eliminated first from season 2. Celebrities appearing in the season were Jeffrey Ross, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, Louie Anderson and Carrot Top. Episodes were 1 hour and the finale was a half-hour long.

====Cancellation====

===Season 4 (2006)===

On May 30, 2006, the show returned to NBC with a two-hour special and a new host, Anthony Clark.

Nielsen ratings from Season 4 averaged a 4.4 share (4,848,800 households).

Josh Blue, a St. Paul, Minnesota native who has cerebral palsy, was the Last Comic Standing on the August 9, 2006, conclusion of the contest. Ty Barnett was the runner-up, while third place went to Chris Porter. Other finalists were (in order of placement) Michele Balan, Roz, Kristin Key, Rebecca Corry, Gabriel Iglesias, Joey Gay, Bil Dwyer, April Macie, and Stella Stolper. Additionally, Theo Von won the separate online contest to be the &quot;Last Comic Downloaded&quot;. Iglesias was disqualified for multiple violations of his contract including using a BlackBerry and became the first in the history of the show to be thrown out of the competition.

===Season 8 (2014)===
Season 8 premiered on May 22, 2014, and consisted of 13 episodes. Roseanne Barr, Keenen Ivory Wayans, and Russell Peters served as judges and J. B. Smoove was the host. The winner received $250,000 and an NBC comedy development deal. Eliminated contestants faced off in an online head-to-head competition called the &quot;Comic Comeback&quot;, with fans voting via Twitter to bring back a comic to perform on the season finale.

Rather than holding open &quot;live&quot; auditions as in previous seasons, the eighth season began with 100 comedians who were invited by an NBC panel, based on reviews of emailed audition submissions. The first four nights of the season (&quot;Invitationals&quot;) featuried 25 comics with the winning comics from these rounds advancing to the semifinals.

Night one and night two aired in a two-hour block on May 22, 2014. These comics advanced to the semi-finals on night one: Tracey Ashley, Mark Normand, Dave Landau, Aida Rodriguez, Joe Machi, and Rod Man. On night two, comics advancing to the semi-final round included: Dana Eagle, Nick Guerra, Erin Jackson, Mike Vecchione, Jasper Redd, Lachlan Patterson, Tyree Elaine, and Jimmy Shubert. Night three aired on May 29, during which the following comics advanced to the next round of the competition: Chloe Hilliard, Alingon Mitra, Gerald Kelly, Zainab Johnson, DC Benny, Emily Galati, and Rocky LaPorte. Airing on June 5, the fourth night saw the advancement of Karlous Miller, DeAnne Smith, Nikki Carr, Tommy Ryman, Yamaneika Saunders, Mike Gaffney, and Monroe Martin. In all, 28 of the initial 100 comics advanced to the semi-finals.

The semi-finals consisted of two shows of 14 contestants each; five comics from each episode advancing to the Top Ten. In the rounds, Amy Schumer and executive producer Wanda Sykes appeared in segments giving advice to the contestants. Comics advancing through the semi-finals into the Challenge Rounds are shown in the accompanying table.

In the Challenge Rounds, the comics attempted to gain immunity from the head-to-head showdown that closed each episode. They participated in challenges which tested their skills in various comic situations. In the sketch comedy challenge (Episode 7), teams of five received advice from comic actress Cheryl Hines, with one entire team being granted immunity. Jay Leno provided advice for the talk show guest challenge (Episode 8), while Ellen DeGeneres hosted the challenge on the set of her show to determine the one comic granted immunity. For the improvisation challenge (Episode 9), Howie Mandel provided advice and one comic was granted immunity. Jeff Ross helped the comics prepare for a roast of Gilbert Gottfried (Episode 10), which determined immunity from the final head-to-head showdown. In all, the Challenge Rounds eliminated five contestants.

After the Challenge Rounds, the five finalists competed in the Title Rounds. They performed for the judges who eliminated whoever they deemed as the weakest performer. They narrowed down the contestants over three episodes (11, 12 and 13) deciding on the winner. The finale included performances by judges Barr, Peters, and the winner of the online Comic Comeback poll, Alingon Mitra.

Beginning with this season, the public did not vote for the Last Comic Standing at any time. The judges made every decision and picked the winner. That happened because Sykes decided that the judges would make a better decision than the potential voting public.

The eighth season winner was Rod Man. He beat out Nikki Carr and Lachlan Patterson in what turned out to be a double-elimination final set. The judges were supposed to narrow the field down to two contestants following the first sets of the two-hour finale, but could not agree on a weakest performance. All three finalists performed another set to determine the winner.

: LCS means the comic was the last comic standing
: WIN means the comic won an immunity challenge
: SAFE means the comic was nominated and won a head-to-head showdown
: LOW means the comic was the last to advance in a judges&#x27; vote
: OUT means the comic was nominated lost a head-to-head showdown (episodes 7-10) or lost judges&#x27; vote (episodes 11-13), and was eliminated
: SD means the comic was nominated and eliminated in a sudden-death round 

 Joe Machi opposed Monroe Martin in Week 9&#x27;s head-to-head elimination. After their sets, the judges said that they were &quot;blown away&quot; by the performance of each comic, and could not agree on a winner. They asked each comic to perform two additional minutes, after which they still could not pick a winner. (Judge Russell Peters was heard shouting, &quot;That solved &quot;nothing&quot;!&quot;) The comics performed a final joke in a sudden-death showdown, Machi won.

After the semi-finals, viewers voted for the &quot;Comic Comeback&quot;, in which a dismissed comic can earn the chance to return and perform a set in the final episode of Season 8. Alingon Mitra beat out the 5 other dismissed contestants to become the Comic Comeback winner. He performed a set in the season finale on August 14.

===Season 9 (2015)===
NBC renewed &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; for a ninth season, which premiered on July 22, 2015. Season 9 was hosted by Anthony Jeselnik; the judges were Keenen Ivory Wayans and Roseanne Barr, returning from the previous season, as well as new judge Norm Macdonald. The top prize, as in the previous season, was $250,000 and an NBC development deal. Season 9 was shorter than any previous season, with only 8 episodes. It eliminated much of the structure of previous seasons, including contestants competing against one another in a variety of challenges, and unstructured interactions between contestants, in favor of a simple series of stand-up performances.

As in the previous season, 100 comics were selected by an NBC panel to compete in the Invitationals. There were five rounds of Invitationals, with 20 comics starting each round. Invitationals Part 1 aired in a two-hour block on July 22, and consisted of the first two rounds. These comics from Round 1 moved on to the semifinals: Taylor Tomlinson, Ian Bagg, Ryan Conner, Ms. Pat, Mehran Khaghani, Moses Storm, DC Ervin, and K-Von. 

Moving on from Round 2 were: Ambrose Jones III, Esther Povitsky, Crystian Ramirez, Bryan Kellen, Kevin Bozeman and Amy Miller. Invitationals Part 2 (Round 3) aired on July 29 and saw the following comics make it to the semifinals: Andy Erikson, Greg Warren, Dominique, Tony Baker, Francisco Ramos, Cyrus McQueen, KT Tatara, Alycia Cooper and Sammy Obeid. Advancing from Invitationals Part 3 (Round 4) that aired August 5 were: Sheng Wang, Joe List, Mike Siegel, Drew Thomas, Andi Smith, Amir Gollan, Brad Loekle and Shakir Standley. The final round of invitationals (Part 4) aired on August 12 and sent the following to the semifinals: Clayton English, Noah Gardenschwarz, Ricarlo Flanagan, Melanie Barchow, Amir K, Lavar Walker, Angelo Tsarukas, Harrison Greenbaum, Mia Jackson, and Michael Palascak.

Part 1 of the two-part semifinals aired August 19 and saw Taylor Tomlinson, Andy Erikson, Francisco Ramos, Sheng Wang and Clayton English advance the Top 10 finals. In Part 2 of the semifinals, aired on August 26, Ian Bagg, Ryan Conner, Dominique, Joe List, and Michael Palascak advanced to the Top 10 finals.

On September 2, 2015, the Top 10 comics were paired in head-to-head duels, as follows, and trimmed to five finalists (winners in bold):
* Michael Palascak vs. Taylor Tomlinson
* Francisco Ramos vs. Ian Bagg 
* Andy Erikson vs. Ryan Conner
* Sheng Wang vs. Dominique
* Clayton English vs. Joe List

The finale aired on September 9, 2015. All five remaining finalists performed one set, after which Clayton English was declared the Season 9 winner.

==Controversy==
During season two, a panel of four celebrity judges was used to shrink the field of 40 semifinalists to ten finalists. The celebrity judges rated each of the semifinalists as they performed and cast votes for the 10 top comedians. When the ten finalists were announced the list did not seem to correspond with the judges&#x27; votes, which the judges noticed. Two celebrity judges, comedians Drew Carey and Brett Butler, left the judges&#x27; table visibly angry after the finalists were announced. 

The two were shown backstage arguing with producers. Carey and Butler did not understand how the finalists who were announced could have advanced, given the way the judges had voted. It was revealed that a panel of four producers were also casting votes in the process, assuring that unless all four celebrity judges cast exactly the same ten votes, their voting power could be usurped by the four unanimously agreeing producers. If for some reason all four celebrity judges did cast exactly the same votes, the worst the producers could be faced with was a tie.

After learning of that, Carey became angry that the producers made it seem he had a deciding vote in the outcome of the show, calling the situation &quot;crooked and dishonest.&quot; It was also revealed that some of the finalists who advanced were clients or employees of the producers or directors of the show.

According to a March 2004 &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; article by Gene Collier, some of the competitors in opening rounds were plants hired by the producers to give bad performances on purpose to liven up the auditions on television.

Top local agents are usually given a number of specific call times for their clients. The first round of auditions were in front of a producer early in the morning; those who were chosen performed for the celebrity judges in the afternoon. Mark Breslin, the owner of Yuk Yuk&#x27;s comedy clubs, which hosted the Toronto audition for season 6, also confirmed that while only two were shown advancing in the final broadcast, four comics had been initially chosen to advance to the finals. Brian Lazanik, one of the two finalists who did not end up at the Las Vegas finals said that he was also chosen as a finalist in season 5&#x27;s Toronto auditions, but was similarly cut. Producers for the show called his agent, urging him to try out again for season 6.

In season 9, Esther Povitsky had an argument with judge Norm Macdonald. Her stand-up section was cut from the show.

<doc id="429161" wikidata="Q16910723" url="?curid=429161" title="Pathognomy">
<text>Pathognomy is &quot;a ″&quot;semiotik&quot;″ of the transient features of someone&#x27;s face or body, be it voluntary or involuntary&quot;. Examples of this can be laughter and winking to the involuntary such as sneezing or coughing. By studying the features or expressions, there is then an attempt to infer the mental state and emotion felt by the individual.

Johann Kaspar Lavater separated pathognomy from physiognomy to limit the so-called power of persons to manipulate the reception of their image in public. Such division is marked by the disassociation of gestural expressions, and volition from the legibility of moral character. Both he and his critic Georg Christoph Lichtenberg branched this term from &quot;physiognomy&quot;, which strictly focused on the static and fixed features of peoples faces and the attempt to discover the relatively enduring traits from them.

Pathognomy is distinguished from physiognomy based on key differences in their features. The latter, which is concerned with the examination of an individual&#x27;s soul through the analysis of his facial features, is used to predict the overall, long-term character of an individual while pathognomy is used to ascertain clues about one&#x27;s current character. Physiognomy is based on the shapes of the features, and pathognomy on the motions of the features. Furthermore, physiognomy is concerned with man&#x27;s disposition while pathognomy focuses on man&#x27;s temporary being and attempts to reveal his current emotional state.

Georg Christoph Lichtenberg states that physiognomy is often used to cover pathognomy, including both fixed and mobile facial features, but the term is overall used to distinguish and identify the characteristics of a person. Pathognomy falls under the term of non-verbal communication, which includes various expressions, ranging from gestures to tone of voice, posture and bodily cues, all of which influence the knowledge and understanding of such emotions.

== Study of pathognomy ==
The science of pathognomy stands as a platform towards the practicality of identifying certain emotions, some of which may be more challenging to identify, such as subtle signs of disease to various psychological disorders. Psychological disorders include depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar personality disorder, eating disorders, Williams syndrome, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders. Emotional recognition through facial expression seems to be the core focus of perception towards understanding the signs of emotions. Over the years, there has been a significant improvement as to how much one can detect emotional signals through non-verbal cues across a variety of databases, from what was based on human emotion recognition, to now a database on computers that provide the same stimuli to research this recognition of emotion further.

== Methods used ==

=== Computer-based methods ===
In 1978, Ekman and his colleague Wallace V. Friesen created a taxonomy of facial muscles and their actions, providing an objective measurement, whereby the system describes the facial behaviour being presented. This is known as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Previous coding systems had a more subjective approach, only attempting to infer the underlying expressions, which heavily relied on an individual&#x27;s perspective and judgement. The FACS mainly focuses on describing the facial expression being portrayed, but interpretation can later be added by the researcher where the facial behaviours closely relate to the emotional situation.

A freely available database that was based on the FACS is Radboud Faces Database (RaFD). This data set contains Caucasian face images of &quot;8 facial expressions, with three gaze directions, photographed simultaneously from five different camera angles&quot;. All RaFD emotions are perceived as clearly expressed, with contempt being the only emotion being less clear than others. Langner et al. concluded that the RaFD is a valuable tool for different research fields towards facial stimuli, including recognition of emotions. In most forms of study that use this database, a method is carried out as follows; participants are presented with the images, and then requested to rate the facial expressions and also rate the attractiveness of each image. This can be further interpreted by the researcher to select the correct stimuli needed for their own research to be carried out.

=== Facial expression method ===
The conventional method for studying emotional perception and recognition, which can also be called the basic emotion method, typically consists of presenting facial expression stimuli in a laboratory setting, through the exposure of stimuli that presents males and females, to adults and children, participants are asked to determine the emotion being expressed. Silvan S Tomkins and his protégés, Carol E. Izard and Paul Ekman conducted such a method in the controlled lab environment. They created sets of photographs, posing the six core emotions; anger, fear, disgust, surprise, sadness and happiness. These photos provided the most precise and most robust representations for each emotion that was to be identified. Participants were then required to choose which word fit the face the most through these photographs. This type of method is commonly used to understand and infer the emotions portrayed through expressions made by individuals.

=== Auditory method ===
Recognition of emotion can be heavily identified through auditory modality; something which plays a vital role in communication within societies. In terms of the study or recognition of emotions through voice, this can be carried out in multiple ways. The main method of strategy for recognising emotion through voice is labelling and categorising which vocal expression matches which emotional stimuli (for example, happiness, sadness or fear). Older studies presented this method through paper-and-pencil tests with audio being played. The researcher then requested the participant to match the audio to the emotion shown on the paper. In Sauter et al.&#x27;s research, they had presented audio stimuli on speakers and asked participants to match the audio to the corresponding emotion by choosing, on a printed sheet, a label illustrated with a photo depicting the facial expression. Chronaki et al. used a fully-computerised method to present the stimuli on headphones and ask participants to select amongst keyboard keys with emotional word labels printed on them. These many modes of research on vocal expression follow a standard method, presenting the stimulus and requesting the participant to provide a matching emotion towards what they have heard. This form can further increase the knowledge of emotions and passions through such non-verbal communications.

<text>Spiral Jetty is a work of land art constructed in April 1970 that is considered to be the most important work by American sculptor Robert Smithson. Smithson documented the construction of the sculpture in a 32-minute color film also titled &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;. Built on the northeastern shore of the Great Salt Lake near Rozel Point in Utah entirely of mud, salt crystals, and basalt rocks, &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; forms a , counterclockwise coil jutting from the shore of the lake.

In 1999, the artwork was donated to the Dia Art Foundation; it is one of 12 locations and sites owned by the foundation. Since its initial construction, those interested in its fate have dealt with questions of proposed changes in land use in the area surrounding the sculpture. In order to preserve the work, Dia asks that visitors not take existing rocks from the artwork, make fire pits, or trample vegetation. There are no facilities at the site, so visitors must carry any waste away with them.

==Description==
The sculpture is built of mud, precipitated salt crystals, and basalt rocks. It forms a , counterclockwise coil originally jutting from the shore of the lake, though due to the drying of the lake, as of 2022 a mile of lakebed separates &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; from the shore. Depending upon the water level of the Great Salt Lake, the sculpture is sometimes visible and sometimes submerged.

==Construction==

Smithson reportedly chose the Rozel Point site based on the blood-red color of the water and its connection with the primordial sea. The red hue of the water is due to the presence of salt-tolerant bacteria and algae that thrive in the extreme 27 percent salinity of the lake&#x27;s north arm, which was isolated from freshwater sources by the building of a causeway by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1959.

Smithson was reportedly attracted to the Rozel Point site because of the stark anti-pastoral beauty and industrial remnants from nearby Golden Spike National Historic Site, as well as an old pier and a few unused oil rigs. While observing the construction of the piece from a helicopter, Smithson reportedly remarked &quot;et in Utah ego&quot; as a counterpoint to the pastoral Baroque painting &quot;et in Arcadia ego&quot; by Nicolas Poussin.

To move the rock into the lake, Smithson hired Bob Phillips of nearby Ogden, Utah, who used two dump trucks, a large tractor, and a front end loader to haul the 6,650 tons of rock and earth into the lake. It is reported that Smithson had a difficult time convincing a contractor to accept the unusual proposal. &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; was the first of his pieces to require the acquisition of land rights and earthmoving equipment. Phillips often told people that his best-known construction job was &quot;the only thing I ever built that ... was to look at and had no purpose&quot;.

Phillips described the use of earth-moving equipment along the lakeside as &quot;tricky&quot;, and said of Smithson that &quot;I don&#x27;t think he had done any geology work or anything on it. He just had in his mind what it should look like... He just had the eye for it. I assume it was the artist in him.&quot; Work began on the jetty in April 1970. The work was constructed twice; the first time requiring six days. After contemplating the result for two days, Smithson called the crew back and had the shape altered to its present configuration, an effort requiring moving 7,000 tons of basalt rock during an additional three days.

Phillips&#x27; son appeared on the PBS &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; program in 2017 with a photograph and collection of documents related to the building of the project.

==Ownership==
The sculpture was financed in part by a $9,000 USD grant from the Virginia Dwan Gallery of New York. In 1999, &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; was donated to Dia. As owner and custodian of &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;, the foundation maintains the lease from the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire &amp; State Lands of state sovereign lands in Great Salt Lake upon which the artwork is sited.

Smithson died in a plane crash in Texas three years after finishing the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;.
Dia, along with the Holt/Smithson Foundation, claim ownership of copyright for &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;. However, the work itself does not meet the legal standard for copyrightable material, which in the United States includes the stipulation that a work must be &quot;fixed&quot; in a &quot;tangible medium.&quot; While &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; was created in a tangible medium, its inherent physical composition — piles of dirt, rocks, and salt that are subject to the erosive forces of the Great Salt Lake — means it is not fixed: &quot;This lack of fixed form problematizes the work’s intellectual property protection. The heart of the work — the idea that it presents made manifest through an ephemeral environmental intervention — cannot be protected based on the guidelines provided under the Copyright Act.&quot; Dia can and does claim copyright over images of &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; created by the foundation. However, due to the physical work&#x27;s lack of copyright protection, visitors do not need permission to create or publish their own photographs of the sculpture.

==Preservation==

Preservation efforts for &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; face considerable challenges due to the remote location of the site and its vulnerability to natural environmental conditions. These challenges are exacerbated by the impacts of climate change and increased tourism activity.

At the time Dia acquired &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;, the work was fully submerged in the lake. Beginning in the early 2000s, however, sustained drought in Utah caused water levels to recede, and &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; became visible for the first prolonged period in its history. As a result, the prominence of &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; has risen dramatically over the past decade, increasing both the visitorship to the site and the public&#x27;s interest in the artwork, at the local, national, and international levels.

Dia is committed to maintaining a photographic record of the work and documenting changes to the piece over time. Dia collaborates with two organizations in Utah, the Great Salt Lake Institute at Westminster College (GSLI) and the Utah Museum of Fine Arts (UMFA) at the University of Utah, who have been deeply involved in the advocacy of &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; over the years.

In 2008, plans were announced for exploratory oil drilling approximately five miles from the jetty. This was met with strong resistance from artists, and the state of Utah received more than 3,000 emails about the plan, most of them opposing the drilling.

The year 2009 marked a collaboration between Dia and the Getty Conservation Institute, with the objective of creating a repeat photography system. This system was specifically designed to document the evolving changes taking place at the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; site and to closely monitor it for any conservation requirements.

Starting in late 2016, Dia initiated the practice of sharing aerial photographs of &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;, captured twice a year since 2012. These photographs were taken from nearly identical vantage points as part of Dia&#x27;s dedication to documenting the evolving changes of the artwork over time through photographic records.

The issue of preservation has been complicated by ambiguous statements by Smithson, who expressed an admiration for entropy in that he intended his works to mimic earthly attributes in that they remain in a state of arrested disruption and not be kept from destruction.

Dia&#x27;s website states that visitors are prohibited from removing rocks from the artwork or from stepping on vegetation that is on the grounds of the artwork. Visitors are also prohibited from constructing fire pits near the artwork or on the parking lot. If caught, visitors will face strict fines. The website also states that visitors are instructed to carry out their waste.

==Film==
In 1970 during the construction of the jetty, Robert Smithson wrote and directed a 32-minute color film, &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;. The film was shot by Smithson and his wife Nancy Holt, and funded by Virginia Dwan and Douglas Christmas.

The film documented the construction process and also formed an ancillary artwork. Smithson combines his interest in geology, paleontology, astronomy, mythology and cinema, stating that he had an interest in documenting &quot;the earth&#x27;s history&quot;. In conjunction with filmed sequences of the jetty, Smithson incorporates footage of dinosaurs in a natural history museum and the ripped pages from a history text. During this scene, Smithson refers to the institutions of history: &quot;the earth&#x27;s history seems at times like a story recorded in a book, each page of which is torn into small pieces. Many of the pages and some of the pieces of each page are missing&quot;. Smithson&#x27;s narrative supports an alternative view of historical discourse and the art object&#x27;s placement or production outside of the museum institution. His writings also indicate that the helicopter film sequences over the jetty were a method of &quot;recapitulating the scale of the jetty&quot;. By visually disorienting the viewer, Smithson is able to negate a time and place for the materiality of the artwork or create what he calls a &quot;cosmic rupture&quot;. Through this state, the viewer is meant to be unable to categorize or classify the site, and will be left in a state free from the dialect of history.

The film has been described as Smithson&#x27;s attempt to &quot;leave the viewer with a sense that the monumental artwork is connected to a vast mental landscape of meanings and associations&quot;.

== Legacy ==

The work was named Utah&#x27;s official state work of land art in 2017. April 2020 marked the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;″s 50th anniversary, which Smithson referred to shortly before his death in 1973 as &quot;the work of the decade&quot;. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2024.

== Criticism ==
The ephemeral nature of the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; (sometimes visible, sometimes submerged) sparked inquiries into the enduring influence of the artwork and the importance of its various representations, such as photographs, films, and essays. The photographs played a critical role in preserving and promoting the earthwork&#x27;s growing renown, acting as the primary connection between the object and its state of being forgotten. Smithson&#x27;s conceptual framework, centered around the concepts of temporality and entropy, emphasized the dynamic and destructive elements at play, often referencing the gradual decline and disintegration of the artwork. Through his essays and interviews, the artist articulated his awareness of these forces at work within his artistic practice. Borrowing from the term &quot;entropy&quot;, Smithson indicated that the earthworks were &quot;suggestions of sites external to the gallery situation&quot;.

In his 1970 interview, Smithson mentioned his interest in working on raw materials with abstract geometrical forms. The ephemeral material changes the properties of the artwork over time, which could be regarded as process-oriented art. In the end, it &quot;dramatizes the sense of context and discontext&quot;. With spiraling screw dislocation in the crystal formation and the enclosed nature of the Salt Lake, Smithson created a sense of containment and movement. The complexity of matter creates an irrational &quot;surd&quot; area. The idea of a closed space is established through the aesthetic concept of crystalline mapping.

Influenced by Wiener&#x27;s system of feedback and entropy, Smithson was aware that the circulation of its photographs would have a tendency to move &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; into an empty signifier without the signified. He mentioned in an interview, &quot;If you make a system, you can be sure the system is bound to evade itself, so I see no point in pinning any hope on systems.&quot; Smithson realized the instability of fugitivity of one&#x27;s surroundings but still required the viewers to apprehend them through their eyes and ears.

Over the decades since the unexpected submersion in 1972, &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; has become known through its wide circulation of photographs. Scholars such as Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin and Henri Bergson frequently debated the issue of timelessness and the fixation of its photographs and multiple referents as signifiers without the signified. Since the 1960s, the notion of life as a multi-formed complexity has challenged the concept of space as a static condition, leading to a reassessment of the notion of temporality. According to Manuel DeLanda, &quot;Rocks and winds, germs and words, are all different manifestations of this dynamic reality...this single matter-energy expresses itself.&quot;

While time and space are seen as key in the discussion of modern sculpture, it raises challenges for analyzing &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; through photographs as it suggests another temporality and hence different values.

As Krauss explains:&quot;In using the form of the spiral to imitate the settlers&#x27; mythic whirlpool, Smithson incorporates the existence of the myth into the space of the work. In doing so, he expands on the nature of that external space located at our bodies&#x27; centers, which had been part of the Double Negative&#x27;s image. Smithson creates an image of our psychological response to time and of the way we are determined to control it by the creation of historical fantasies. But the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; attempts to supplant historical formulas with the experience of a moment-to-moment passage through space and time.&quot;

However, the site experience and the referents are not self-sufficient, as art historian Ann Morris Reynolds says:Although I acknowledged that these descriptions were partial and distanced from their referent ... I still felt they provided visual and conceptual proxies, images and ideas, that seemed sufficient. September for the very first time, I was deeply aware of the fact that neither my on-site experience nor the descriptions that I was familiar with, both old and new, were self-sufficient or even clearly distinct.
As time has passed since the completion of the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;, the photographs have become the most accessible and vivid remnants of the artwork. However, they no longer serve as helpful maps leading to a physical location; instead, they have become signs that direct viewers to an apparitional and chemically vanished object. Lunberry questions the grounding and ontological location of the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;, suggesting that its various manifestations, including photographs, essays, films, and the actual earthwork, refer to each other but do not fully settle on a singular object. He states:
The photographs thus remain as utterly believable substitutes, authentic apparitions, all that has been needed to restore to our eager eyes the vanished earthwork, raise the form once and for all from out of the waters that both reflect and conceal the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;, affirm and deny its place upon the lake.

The disappearance of the earthwork raises perplexing questions about the significance and impact of its material absence. The photographs, the essay, and the film become intertwined with the submerged earthwork, but what happens to the object itself when all that remains are these representations? Additionally, the disappearance of thousands of tons of stone and soil raises the challenge of accounting for such a massive fact. Lunberry continues: 
Then, looking into our own desiring eyes, we may begin to wonder if the issue of seeing itself - the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;&#x27;s appearance or disappearance, its ontology as an object or an image - has finally proven itself to be far more intricate and involved than initially imagined. If Henri Bergson is to be believed and &quot;perception is only a true hallucination&quot;, then where would we have to go, what would we have to do to locate the precise vanishing point of Smithson&#x27;s &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;, to arrive at the site of our own craving, to see the source of our own hallucination?

Lunberry suggested that there is a &quot;dialectical play arises in the process of creating affective awareness&quot; Lunberry&#x27;s affective memories were primarily produced by his own picture of the Spiral Jetty, and an active recall of his past conscious and unconscious memories of seeing the Spiral Jetty years &quot;after&quot; his last visit. Similar to Krauss, Lunberry&#x27;s viewing experience involved an imaginary voyage, except that he is aware of temporality: Spiral Jetty has vanished. Lunberry stated, &quot;the effect of a ghost whose mysterious apparitions

During and after the completion of the work, Gianfranco Gorgoni documented the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; with Smithson. Since 2012, the present owner of the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;, the Dia Foundation, has committed to annual aerial documentation. Smithson was confident that &quot;if the work is strong enough and photographed properly, it is fed back into mass distribution&quot;.

<text>Erich Auerbach (9 November 1892 – 13 October 1957) was a German philologist and comparative scholar and critic of literature. His best-known work is &quot;&quot;, a history of representation in Western literature from ancient to modern times frequently cited as a classic in the study of realism in literature. Along with Leo Spitzer, Auerbach is widely recognized as one of the foundational figures of comparative literature.

==Biography==
Auerbach, who was Jewish and born in Berlin, was trained in the German philological tradition and eventually became, along with Leo Spitzer, one of its best-known scholars. After participating as a combatant in World War I, he earned a doctorate in 1921 at the University of Greifswald, served as librarian at the Prussian State Library for some years, and in 1929 became a member of the philology faculty at the University of Marburg, publishing a well-received study titled &quot;Dante: Poet of the Secular World&quot;.

With the rise of National Socialism Auerbach was forced to vacate his position in 1935. Exiled from Nazi Germany, he took up residence in Istanbul, Turkey, where he wrote &quot;Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature&quot; (1946), generally considered his masterwork. He was chair of the faculty for Western languages and literatures at Istanbul University from 1936 to 1947. Auerbach&#x27;s life and work in Turkey is detailed and placed in historical and sociological context in Kader Konuk&#x27;s &quot;East West Mimesis: Auerbach in Turkey&quot; (2010).

Auerbach moved to the United States in 1947, teaching at Pennsylvania State University and then working at the Institute for Advanced Study. He was appointed professor of Romance philology at Yale University in 1950, a position he held until his death in 1957 in Wallingford, Connecticut.

While at Yale, Auerbach was one of Fredric Jameson&#x27;s teachers.

==Reception==
In the 50-year commemoration reprinting of Auerbach&#x27;s &quot;Mimesis&quot;, Edward Said of Columbia University included an extended introduction to Auerbach and mentioned the book&#x27;s debt to Giambattista Vico, writing: &quot;As one can immediately judge by its subtitle, Auerbach&#x27;s book is by far the largest in scope and ambition out of all the other important critical works of the past half century. Its range covers literary masterpieces from Homer and the Old Testament right through to Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust, although as Auerbach says apologetically at the end of the book, for reasons of space he had to leave out a great deal of medieval literature as well as some crucial modern writers like Pascal and Baudelaire.&quot;

<text>Edwin Donald &quot;Duke&quot; Snider (September 19, 1926 – February 27, 2011), nicknamed &quot;the Duke of Flatbush&quot;, was an American professional baseball player. Primarily a center fielder, he spent most of his Major League Baseball (MLB) career playing for the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers (1947–1962), later playing one season each for the New York Mets (1963) and San Francisco Giants (1964).

Snider was named to the National League (NL) All-Star roster eight times and was the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) runner-up in 1955. In his 16 seasons with the Dodgers, he helped lead the team to six World Series, with victories in 1955 and 1959. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1980.

==Early life==
Born in Los Angeles, Snider was nicknamed &quot;Duke&quot; by his father at age 5 as the result of a self-confident swagger that caused his parents to say he carried himself like royalty. Growing up in Southern California, Snider was a gifted all-around athlete, playing basketball, football, and baseball at Compton High School, class of 1944. He was a strong-armed quarterback, who reportedly could throw the football 70 yards.

== Minor leagues ==
Spotted by one of Branch Rickey&#x27;s scouts in the early 1940s, he was signed to a baseball contract out of high school in 1943. He played briefly for the Montreal Royals of the International League in 1944 (batting twice) and for the Newport News Dodgers in the Piedmont League in the same year. After serving in the U.S. Navy in 1945 and part of 1946, he came back to play for the Fort Worth Cats that year, and also for St. Paul in 1947.

==Major leagues ==

=== The Boys of Summer ===
Snider earned a tryout with the Brooklyn Dodgers during their spring training in 1947. He got his first major league at bat in the second Dodgers game of the 1947 season on April 17 and hit a single. He played in 39 more games that season and became a friend of Jackie Robinson before he was sent to the St. Paul team in early July. Snider returned to the Dodgers at the end of the season in time for the World Series against the New York Yankees. Snider (after spring training with the Dodgers) started the 1948 season with Montreal, and after hitting well in that league with a .327 batting average, he was called up to Brooklyn in August and played in 53 games. In 1949, Snider became a regular major leaguer hitting 23 home runs with 92 runs batted in, helping the Dodgers into the World Series. Snider also saw his average climb from .244 to .292. A more mature Snider became the &quot;trigger man&quot; in a power-laden lineup which boasted players Joe Black, Roy Campanella, Billy Cox, Carl Erskine, Carl Furillo, Gil Hodges, Clem Labine, Pee Wee Reese, Jackie Robinson, and Preacher Roe. Often compared with two other New York center fielders, fellow Baseball Hall of Famers, Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays, he was the reigning &quot;Duke&quot; of Flatbush.

In 1950, he hit .321 and led the National League with 199 base hits and 343 total bases, earning his first All-Star Game appearance. When his average slipped to .277 in 1951 (a season when the Dodgers lost a 13‑game August lead and finished second to the Giants after Bobby Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot;), Snider was roundly criticized in the newspapers. Snider recalls, &quot;I went to Walter O&#x27;Malley and told him I couldn&#x27;t take the pressure&quot;, and, &quot;I told him I&#x27;d just as soon be traded. I told him I figured I could do the Dodgers no good.&quot; The trade did not happen.
Usually batting third in the lineup, Snider established impressive offensive numbers. He hit 40 or more home runs in five consecutive seasons (1953–1957), and between 1953 and 1956 he averaged 42 home runs, 124 RBI, 123 runs, and a .320 batting average. He led the National League (NL) in runs scored, home runs, and RBI in separate seasons. He appeared in six post-seasons with the Dodgers (1949, 1952–53, 1955–56, 1959), facing the New York Yankees in the first five and the Chicago White Sox in the last. The Dodgers won the World Series in 1955 and in 1959.

Snider&#x27;s career numbers declined when the team moved to Los Angeles in 1958. Coupled with an aching knee and a right field fence at the cavernous Coliseum, Snider hit only 15 home runs in 1958. However, he had one last hurrah in 1959 as he helped the Dodgers win their first World Series in Los Angeles. Duke rebounded that year to hit .308 with 23 home runs and 88 RBI in 370 at bats while sharing fielding duties in right and center fields with Don Demeter and rookie Ron Fairly. Injuries and age would eventually play a role in reducing Snider to part-time status by 1961.

In 1962 when the Dodgers led the NL for most of the season (only to find themselves tied with the hated Giants at the season&#x27;s end), it was Snider and third-base coach Leo Durocher who reportedly pleaded with manager Walter Alston to bring in future Hall of Fame pitcher (and Cy Young Award winner that year) Don Drysdale in the ninth inning of the third and deciding playoff game. Instead, Alston brought in Stan Williams to relieve a tiring Eddie Roebuck. A 4–2 lead turned into a 6–4 loss as the Giants rallied to win the pennant. Snider was subsequently sold to the New York Mets. It is said that Drysdale, his roommate, broke down and cried when he got the news of Snider&#x27;s departure.

===Final years===
When Snider joined the Mets, he discovered that his familiar number 4 was being worn by Charlie Neal. Snider wore number 11 during the first half of the season, then switched back to 4 after Neal was traded. He proved to be a sentimental favorite among former Dodger fans who now rooted for the Mets. On April 16, 1963, Snider recorded his 2,000th hit, doing so at Crosley Field against the Cincinnati Reds on a single off Jim Maloney in the 2nd inning. On June 14, he recorded his 400th home run, once again against the Reds, doing so in the first inning off Bob Purkey. He was named to the All-Star Game in Cleveland, his eighth and final selection. He entered the game as a pinch hitter for Tommy Davis in the top of the ninth inning. Facing Dick Radatz, he struck out looking. For the season with the Mets, he appeared in 129 games while batting a slashline of .243/.345/.401, with 14 home runs, 45 RBIs, 45 walks, and 56 strikeouts. After one season, Snider asked to be traded to a contending team.

Snider was sold to the San Francisco Giants on Opening Day in 1964. Knowing that he had no chance of wearing number 4, which had been worn by Mel Ott and retired by the Giants, Snider took number 28. In 91 games played with the Giants, he batted a line of .210/.302/.323 while having four home runs and 17 RBIs. He had no triples for the first and only time in his career. He had 40 strikeouts and 22 walks. He appeared in three different positions for the Giants, playing 26 games in right field and 18 in left field for a combined total of 288.2 innings. He made 44 putouts, two assists with one error for a .979 fielding percentage. He retired at the end of that season.

He finished his major league career with a lifetime .295 batting average, 2,116 hits, 1,259 runs, 407 home runs, and 1,333 RBI. Defensively, he posted a .985 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions.

=== 1955 MVP balloting controversy ===
Snider finished second to teammate Roy Campanella in the 1955 Most Valuable Player (MVP) balloting conducted by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. He trailed Campanella by just five points, 226–221, with each man receiving eight first-place votes. A widely believed story, summarized in an article by columnist Tracy Ringolsby, holds that a hospitalized writer from Philadelphia had turned in a ballot with Campanella listed as his first-place and fifth-place vote. It was assumed that the writer had meant to write Snider&#x27;s name into one of those slots. Unable to get a clarification from the ill writer, the BBWAA considered disallowing the ballot but decided to accept it, counting the first-place vote for Campanella and counting the fifth-place vote as though it were left blank. Had the ballot been disallowed, the vote would have been won by Snider 221–212. Had Snider gotten that now-blank fifth-place vote, the final vote would have favored Snider 227–226.

Sportswriter Joe Posnanski, however, has suggested that this story is not entirely true. Posnanski writes that there was a writer who &quot;did&quot; leave Snider off his ballot and write in Campanella&#x27;s name twice, but it was in first and sixth positions, not first and fifth. Had Snider received the sixth place vote, the final tally would have created a tie, not a win for Snider. Additionally, the position wasn&#x27;t discarded — everyone lower on the ballot was moved up a spot, and pitcher Jack Meyer was inserted at the bottom with a 10th place vote.

Snider did win the Sporting News National League Player of the Year Award for 1955, and the Sid Mercer Award, emblematic of his selection by the New York branch of the BBWAA as the National League&#x27;s best player of 1955.

==Later life==
Following his retirement from baseball, Snider became a popular and respected TV/radio analyst and play-by-play announcer for the San Diego Padres from 1969 to 1971 and for the Montreal Expos from 1973 to 1986. He was characterized by a mellow, low-key style.

Snider occasionally took acting roles, sometimes appearing in television or films as himself or as a professional baseball player. He played himself in &quot;Hero Father&quot; (1956) in the Robert Young television series &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, made one guest appearance on the Chuck Connors television series &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, and played Wallace in &quot;The Retired Gun&quot; (1959). Other appearances include an uncredited part as a Los Angeles Dodgers center fielder in &quot;The Geisha Boy&quot; (1958), the Cranker in &quot;The Trouble with Girls&quot; (1969), and a Steamer Fan in &quot;Pastime&quot; (1990). As recently as 2007, he was featured in &quot;Brooklyn Dodgers: Ghosts of Flatbush&quot;.
In 1995, Snider and Willie McCovey pleaded guilty to federal tax fraud charges after they had failed to report income from sports card shows and memorabilia sales. Snider admitted to intentionally failing to report $100,000 of income between 1984 and 1993, and said he did it because he needed the money after failed investments depleted his savings. Snider paid $30,000 in back taxes and a $5,000 fine, and was sentenced to two years of probation. McCovey also paid a fine and was sentenced to probation. In 2017, President Barack Obama issued pardons for Snider and McCovey.

Snider was featured, along with Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays, in the 1981 song &quot;Talkin&#x27; Baseball&quot; by Terry Cashman.

He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1980. That same year, in a ceremony at Dodger Stadium, Snider&#x27;s jersery number 4 was retired by the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1999, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; placed Snider at number 83 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Players&quot;. He was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

Snider married Beverly Null in 1947; they had four children.

Snider died on February 27, 2011, at age 84 of an undisclosed illness at the Valle Vista Convalescent Hospital in Escondido, California. He was the last living Brooklyn Dodger who was on the field for the final out of the 1955 World Series.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Snider as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II.

<text>Human Touch is the ninth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen. The album was released on March 27, 1992, the same day as &quot;Lucky Town&quot;. It was the more popular of the two, peaking at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and lead single &quot;Human Touch&quot; (double A-side single with &quot;Lucky Town&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Better Days&quot;) peaking at number one on the Mainstream Rock and number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. &quot;Human Touch&quot; has since Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for over one million copies sold in the US, and was nominated for Best Rock Vocal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards.

==Background==
Not long after Springsteen broke up the E Street Band in October 1989, pianist Roy Bittan played Springsteen three instrumental songs he had written: &quot;Roll of the Dice&quot;, &quot;Real World&quot; and &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot;. Springsteen later added lyrics to the songs, and liked them to the point where he began writing and recording more songs. With the E Street Band gone—except for Bittan, who played keyboards and co-produced the album—Springsteen assembled a band of studio musicians in Los Angeles, mostly using the services of Randy Jackson on bass guitar and Jeff Porcaro on drums. A wide variety of background vocalists were used, including Sam Moore, Bobby Hatfield, and Bobby King. Overall, at least 25 or so songs were recorded, but the exact number is unknown.

The album was originally set for a spring-summer 1991 release date, having been pushed back from early 1991, but was once again halted when Springsteen began recording &quot;Lucky Town&quot; later that year. Springsteen ultimately decided to release both albums on the same day, with &quot;Human Touch&quot; released on March 27, 1992—more than two years after starting the project.

Porcaro was asked by Springsteen to join the band for the subsequent tour, but declined because he was engaged with his own band Toto. Porcaro died a few months later of a heart attack in his garden.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Human Touch&quot; debuted and peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 selling 246,000 copies during its first week. The album was met with a generally mixed critical reception. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 4 stars and noted that the songs &quot;explore the movement from disenchanted isolation to a willingness to risk love and its attendant traumas again.&quot; The review also stated that the title track &quot;stands among Springsteen&#x27;s best work.&quot; However Bill Wyman of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; gave the album a very harsh review, calling it &quot;the worst piece of [expletive] you can imagine coming from a talent on Springsteen&#x27;s level.&quot; Out of the album&#x27;s 14 tracks, Wyman said there was only &quot;one passable Springsteen song, &#x27;The Long Goodbye.&#x27; The lyrics don&#x27;t make much sense...but it has a bruising musical onslaught that covers up a lot.&quot;

Though his initial review was more positive, Greg Kot of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; later wrote that &quot;in retrospect, &quot;Human Touch&quot; tried to re-create the stadium-rocking aura of an E Street album, with session musicians unsuccessfully replacing the road-tested band.&quot; AllMusic later described the album as &quot;generic pop&quot; and &quot;his first that didn&#x27;t at least aspire to greatness.&quot;

The album is generally disliked by Springsteen fans, and in 2012 was ranked last among Springsteen&#x27;s albums by the online magazine &quot;Nerve&quot;. Regarding the bad reputation of &quot;Human Touch&quot; and &quot;Lucky Town&quot; among his fans, Springsteen said: &quot;I tried it [writing happy songs] in the early &#x27;90s and it didn&#x27;t work; the public didn&#x27;t like it.&quot;

===Unreleased outtakes===
Springsteen&#x27;s first album without the E Street Band featured numerous outtakes, many of which have been released. A cover of &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; was released as a B-side and on &quot;The Essential Bruce Springsteen&quot;, &quot;Chicken Lips and Lizard Hips&quot; was released on a children&#x27;s album, and &quot;30 Days Out&quot; was also a B-side. &quot;Part Man, Part Monkey&quot;, a track originally recorded during the &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; session and performed on that tour, was re-recorded and released as a B-side and on &quot;Tracks&quot; along with other outtakes such as &quot;Trouble In Paradise&quot;, &quot;Sad Eyes&quot;, &quot;Leavin&#x27; Train&quot;, &quot;Seven Angels&quot;, &quot;My Lover Man&quot;, &quot;When the Lights Go Out&quot;, &quot;Over the Rise&quot;, &quot;Goin&#x27; Cali&quot; and &quot;Loose Change&quot;. &quot;Trouble River&quot; was released on &quot;18 Tracks&quot;. Springsteen also recorded &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot;, a tribute to his wife Patti Scialfa and a song performed often, eventually released as a live version on the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; album, &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, which would later get re-worked with the reunited E Street Band in 1995 for &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, and &quot;All the Way Home&quot;, a song Springsteen gave to Southside Johnny and one that Springsteen would not release until 2005&#x27;s &quot;Devils &amp; Dust&quot;.

<doc id="429167" wikidata="Q931805" url="?curid=429167" title="Shaku (unit)">
<text>or Japanese foot is a Japanese unit of length derived (but varying) from the Chinese , originally based upon the distance measured by a human hand from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the forefinger (compare span). Traditionally, the length varied by location or use, but it is now standardized as 10/33 m, or approximately .

==Etymology in English==
 entered English in the early 18th century, a romanization of the Japanese Go-on reading of the character for .

==Use in Japan==
The had been standardized as since 1891. This means that there are about 3.3 () to one meter.

This definition was established by Meiji government law; until then, even though the unit was given the same name, its length varied depending on the era. At the same time, other units were established based on shaku.

English：1Shaku = 10Cun = 100bu
Japanese：1尺 = 10寸 = 100分

The use of the unit for official purposes in Japan was banned on March 31, 1966, although it is still used in traditional Japanese carpentry and some other fields, such as kimono construction. The traditional Japanese bamboo flute known as the ( and ) derives its name from its length of one and eight . Similarly, the remains in use in the Japanese lumber trade. In the Japanese construction industry, the standard sizes of drywall, plywood, and other sheet goods are based on , with the most common width being three (rounded up to ). 

In Japanese media parlance, refers to screen time: the amount of time someone or something is shown on screen (similar to the English &quot;footage&quot;).

==History==
Traditionally, the actual length of the varied over time, location, and use. By the early 19th century, the was largely within the range of , but a longer value of the (also known as the ) was also known, and was 1.17 times longer than the present value (). 

===Carpenter&#x27;s unit and tailor&#x27;s unit===
Another variant was used for measuring cloth, which measured meters (), and was known as the , as baleen (whale whiskers) were used as cloth rulers.

To distinguish the two variants of , the general unit was known as the . The Shōsōin treasure house in Nara preserves some antique ivory one- rulers, known as the .

==Derived units==

===Length===
Just as with the Chinese unit, the is divided into ten smaller units, known as in Japanese, and ten together form a larger unit known in Japanese as a . The Japanese also had a third derived unit, the , equal to six ; this was used extensively in traditional Japanese architecture as the distance between supporting pillars in Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines.

===Volume===
Ten cubic comprised a , reckoned as the amount of rice necessary to sustain a peasant for a year.

== Outside Japan ==
The Japanese also forms the basis of the modern Taiwanese foot.

In 1909, the Korean Empire adopted the Japanese definition of the as that of the ().

<doc id="429168" wikidata="Q1033187" url="?curid=429168" title="Skull and crossbones">
<text>A skull and crossbones is a symbol consisting of a human skull and two long bones crossed together under or behind the skull. The design originated in the Late Middle Ages as a symbol of death and especially as a &quot;memento mori&quot; on tombstones. Actual skulls and bones were long used to mark the entrances to Spanish cemeteries (campo santo).

In modern contexts, it is generally used as a hazard symbol, usually in regard to poisonous substances, such as deadly chemicals.

It is also associated with piracy and software piracy, due to its historical use in some Jolly Roger flags.

== Military use ==

The skull and bones are often used in military insignia, such as the coats of arms of regiments.

Since the mid-18th century, skull and crossbones insignia has been officially used in European armies as symbols of superiority. One of the first regiments was the Frederick the Great&#x27;s Hussars in 1741, also known as the &quot;&quot;. From this tradition, the skull became an important emblem in the German army. Identical insignia has been used in the Prussian army after the First World War by and in Nazi Germany by the Wehrmacht and the SS. The idea of elitism symbolized by the skull and crossbones has influenced sub- and pop culture and has become part of the fashion industry.
== Symbol for poisonous substances ==
The skull and crossbones has long been a standard symbol for poison.

In 1829, New York State required the labeling of all containers of poisonous substances. The skull and crossbones symbol appears to have been used for that purpose since the 1850s. Previously a variety of motifs had been used, including the Danish &quot;+ + +&quot; and drawings of skeletons.

In the 1870s poison manufacturers around the world began using bright cobalt bottles with a variety of raised bumps and designs (to enable easy recognition in the dark) to indicate poison, but by the 1880s the skull and cross bones had become ubiquitous, and the brightly coloured bottles lost their association.

In the United States, due to concerns that the skull-and-crossbones symbol&#x27;s association with pirates might encourage children to play with toxic materials, the Mr. Yuk symbol was created to denote poison. However, in 2001, the American Association of Poison Control Center voted to continue to require the skull and crossbones symbol.

<text>Characterology () is the academic study of character which was prominent in German-speaking countries during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is considered a historic branch of personality psychology, which extended into psychoanalysis and sociology.

The name dates from 1867, having been introduced by the German philosopher Julius Bahnsen, though the discipline itself dates back to classical antiquity. In German psychology, the term &quot;character&quot; was often used in place of &quot;personality&quot;. As such, characterology was the study of personality, its development, and its differences between individuals. The term &quot;personality&quot; however, which was dominant in English use, came to be preferred after the end of World War II.

In the 1920s, the term characterology was appropriated by American writer Leander Hamilton McCormick to promote a physiognomical and phrenological pseudoscience. McCormick&#x27;s views have further been regarded as scientific racism.

<doc id="429172" wikidata="Q15933047" url="?curid=429172" title="Umbellularia">
<text>Umbellularia californica is a large hardwood tree native to coastal forests and the Sierra foothills of California, and to coastal forests extending into Oregon. It is the sole species in the genus Umbellularia. The tree&#x27;s pungent leaves have a similar flavor to bay leaves, though stronger, and it may be mistaken for bay laurel.

The tree is endemic to the California Floristic Province. It is a host of the pathogen that causes sudden oak death. The dry wood has a color range from blonde (like maple) to brown (like walnut). It is considered an excellent tonewood and is sought after by luthiers and woodworkers.

==Description==
It is an evergreen tree growing to tall with a trunk up to in diameter. The largest recorded tree is in Mendocino County, California, and measured (as of 1997) in height with a spread. The thin bark is smooth and gray-brown when young, later turning reddish brown and scaly.

The fragrant leaves are smooth-edged and lance-shaped, long and around a third as wide, similar to the related bay laurel, though usually narrower, and without the crinkled margin of that species. The leaves are green, and lighter on the underside. The bark and leaves have a pungent scent resembling camphor when bruised, due to a chemical known as umbellulone.

The flowers are small, yellow or yellowish-green, produced in small umbels (hence the scientific name &quot;Umbellularia&quot;, &quot;little umbel&quot;). Unlike other &quot;bay laurels&quot; of the genus &quot;Laurus&quot;, &quot;Umbellularia&quot; has perfect flowers (male and female parts in the same flower).

The fruit, also known as &quot;California bay nut&quot;, is a round and green berry 2–2.5 cm long and 2 cm broad, lightly spotted with yellow, maturing purple. Under the thin, leathery skin, it consists of an oily, fleshy covering over a single hard, thin-shelled pit, and resembles a miniature avocado. (&quot;Umbellularia&quot; is related to the avocado&#x27;s genus &quot;Persea&quot;, within the family Lauraceae.) The fruit ripens around October–November in the native range.

The oldest-known living laurel is the Jepson Laurel, named after Willis Linn Jepson, in San Mateo County. The tree lives on San Francisco Water Department land, the agency caring for the tree.

== Taxonomy ==
The tree was formerly known as &quot;Oreodaphne californica&quot;. In Yuki, it is called pōl’-cum ōl. In Oregon, this tree is known as Oregon myrtle, while in California it is called California bay laurel, which may be shortened to California bay or California laurel. It has also been called pepperwood, spicebush, cinnamon bush, peppernut tree, headache tree, mountain laurel, and balm of heaven.

== Distribution and habitat ==

&quot;Umbellularia&quot; is found in southwest Oregon and in California south to San Diego County. It is also found in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. It occurs at altitudes from sea level up to . It is an introduced species in British Columbia, Washington, and northern Oregon.

It mostly inhabits redwood forests, California mixed woods, yellow pine forest, and oak woodlands. Bays occur in oak woodland close to the coast, and in northern California where moisture is sufficient, usually in or near riparian areas. The species is very shade tolerant. It is reduced to a shrub in extreme dry and hot habitats.

During the Miocene, oak-laurel forests were found in Central and Southern California. Typical tree species included oaks ancestral to present-day California oaks, and an assemblage of trees from the laurel family, including &quot;Nectandra, Ocotea, Persea,&quot; and &quot;Umbellularia&quot;. Only one native species from the laurel family, &quot;Umbellularia californica&quot;, remains in California today.

== Ecology ==
The trees resprout after being killed by fire. Deer browse the fresh sprouts.

The species is a host of &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot;, the pathogen that causes the disease sudden oak death. It is important in this sense because it is one of two tree species (tanoak being the other) on which the pathogen readily produces spores.

== Uses ==

===Historical usage===
&quot;Umbellularia&quot; has long been valued for its many uses by Native Americans throughout the tree&#x27;s range, including the Cahuilla, Chumash, Ohlone, Pomo, Miwok, Yuki, Coos, and Salinan people. The Concow tribe call the plant sō-ē’-bä (Konkow language).

Poultices of &quot;Umbellularia&quot; leaves were used to treat rheumatism and neuralgias. A tea was made from the leaves to treat stomach aches, colds, sore throats, and to clear up mucus in the lungs. The leaves were steeped in hot water to make an infusion that was used to wash sores. The Pomo and Yuki tribes of Mendocino County treated headaches by placing a single leaf in the nostril or bathing the head with a laurel leaf infusion.

Both the flesh and the inner kernel of the fruit have been used as food by Native Americans. The fatty outer flesh of the fruit, or mesocarp, is palatable raw for only a brief time when ripe; prior to this the volatile aromatic oils are too strong, and afterwards the flesh quickly becomes bruised, like that of an overripe avocado. Native Americans dried the fruits in the sun and ate only the lower third of the dried mesocarp, which is less pungent.

The hard inner seed underneath the fleshy mesocarp, like the pit of an avocado, cleaves readily in two when its thin shell is cracked. The pit itself was traditionally roasted to a dark chocolate-brown color, removing much of the pungency and leaving a spicy flavor. Roasted, shelled &quot;bay nuts&quot; were eaten whole, or ground into powder and prepared as a drink which resembles unsweetened chocolate. The flavor, depending on roast level, has been described variously as &quot;roast coffee,&quot; &quot;dark chocolate&quot; or &quot;burnt popcorn&quot;. The powder might also be used in cooking or pressed into cakes and dried for winter storage. It has been speculated that the nuts contain a stimulant; however this possible effect has been little documented by biologists.

===Modern usage===

The leaf has been used in cooking but contains large amounts of the toxic compound umbellulone, which causes methemoglobinemia. Umbellulone is absent from culinary bay leaves (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;). &quot;Umbellularia&quot; leaf imparts a somewhat stronger camphor/cinnamon flavor compared to the Mediterranean bay.

Some modern-day foragers and wild food enthusiasts have adopted Native American practices regarding the fruit, the bay nut, edible when roasted.

&quot;Umbellularia californica&quot; is also used in woodworking. It is considered a tonewood, used to construct the backs and sides of acoustic guitars. The wood is very hard and fine, and is also made into bowls, spoons, and other small items and sold as &quot;myrtlewood&quot;. It is also grown as an ornamental tree, both in its native area, and further north up the Pacific coast to Vancouver in Canada, and in western Europe. It can be planted as a hedge or windbreak. It is occasionally used for firewood.

According to a modern Miwok recipe for acorn soup, &quot;it is essential that you add a generous amount of California laurel&quot; when storing acorns to dry, to keep insects away from the acorns.

One popular use for the leaves is to put them between the bed mattresses to get rid of, or prevent, flea infestations.

The wood is used as lumber in furniture making, especially highly figured specimens.

==== &quot;Myrtlewood&quot; money ====
&quot;Myrtlewood&quot; is the only wood still in use as a base &quot;metal&quot; for legal tender. During the 1933 &quot;interregnum of despair&quot; between Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s election and his inauguration, the only bank in the town of North Bend, Oregon—the First National—was forced to temporarily close its doors, precipitating a cash-flow crisis for the City of North Bend. The city solved this problem by minting its own currency, using myrtlewood discs printed on a newspaper press. These coins, in denominations from 25 cents to $10, were used to pay employees, with the city promising to redeem them for cash as soon as it became available.

However, when the bank reopened and the city appealed for people to bring their myrtlewood money in to redeem it, many opted to keep their tokens as collector&#x27;s items. After several appeals, the city announced that the tokens would remain legal tender in the city of North Bend in perpetuity. The unredeemed tokens have become very valuable, because of scarcity and historical interest. Fewer than 10 full sets are believed to exist.

<doc id="429176" wikidata="Q6138306" url="?curid=429176" title="USS Nathan Hale">
<text>USS &quot;Nathan Hale&quot; (SSBN-623) was the sixth nuclear-powered fleet ballistic missile submarine produced. She was named for Captain Nathan Hale (1755–1776), a Connecticut schoolteacher who served in the Continental Army and known most famously for giving his life as a spy during the American Revolutionary War.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract for &quot;Nathan Hale&quot;″s construction was awarded on 3 February 1961. Construction began on 2 October 1961 by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 12 January 1963, sponsored by Mary Lee Lamar Anderson, the wife of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral George Whelan Anderson, Jr., and commissioned on 23 November 1963 in a subdued ceremony due to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the day before.

==Operational history==
&quot;Nathan Hale&quot; entered service on 21 May 1964 with her home port at Charleston, South Carolina, and performed deterrent patrols as a member of the United States Atlantic Fleet. She was originally outfitted with the Polaris missile system and in the 1970s underwent conversion to the Poseidon missile system. In the period 1967-68 she underwent overhaul and refueling, and was subsequently transferred to the Pacific Fleet, home ported in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and operating out of Agana, Guam. By April 1986 she had completed 69 deterrent patrols in the Atlantic and Pacific.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Nathan Hale&quot; was decommissioned on 3 November 1986 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 January 1987. Ex-&quot;Nathan Hale&quot; entered the Navy&#x27;s Nuclear-Powered Ship-Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington on 2 October 1991. Recycling of Ex-&quot;Nathan Hale&quot; was completed on 5 April 1994.

==In fiction==
&quot;Nathan Hale&quot;″s hull number, &quot;623&quot;, was used on the submarine portraying the fictional U.S. Navy nuclear submarine USS &quot;Sawfish&quot; in the 1959 film &quot;On the Beach&quot;. However, the U.S. Navy did not cooperate in the making of &quot;On the Beach&quot;, and the submarine portraying USS &quot;Sawfish&quot; was in reality the British Royal Navy diesel-electric submarine , which bore no connection to USS &quot;Nathan Hale&quot;.

&quot;Nathan Hale&quot; was the name of the U.S. Navy nuclear submarine in the 1967 novel &quot;Pre-Empt&quot; by John R. Vorhies. Pub Date: 23 Oct. 1967, Publisher: Regnery. The novel involved a U.S. Navy nuclear missile submarine commander who goes rogue and threatens to launch his submarine&#x27;s missiles unless all the world&#x27;s nuclear powers surrender their nuclear weapons to an international body.

<text>A Liseuse desk is a medium-sized writing table with a small hinged panel in the middle which can spring up by the aid of a mechanism or be propped up at a desired angle to facilitate reading, or writing on its slanted surface. Many have lateral panels which swing out on both sides to give a larger desk surface.

The name comes from &quot;liseuse&quot; which is the feminine form of &quot;liseur&quot; in French. This is often translated as &quot;reader&quot; but it is used normally to describe a person who really likes to read, while a simple reader is called &quot;lecteur&quot; or &quot;lectrice&quot; in the feminine gender. This is one indication of who this type of desk was originally marketed to.

The Liseuse is an antique desk form which was popular in France during the 18th century and produced again in the first part of the 19th century. It was copied in several continental countries and in the United Kingdom.

Many Liseuses are polyvalent pieces of furniture with a double or triple use. Geared towards an 18th-century feminine market for the most part, they often have drawers made specially for storing toiletry and cosmetics in addition to the drawer or drawers containing paper, quill, ink and other writing implements.

<text>Henryk Józef Muszyński (born 20 March 1933 in Kościerzyna, Kashubia) is the Primate Emeritus of Poland and former archbishop of Gniezno, Poland, having been appointed by Pope John Paul II when the Polish hierarchy was reorganized in March 1992. He had previously been Bishop of Włocławek since 1987.

== Life ==

He is known for his Biblical studies, especially concerning the Qumran manuscripts.

He has been described as &quot;an advocate of open and tolerant Catholicism&quot;.

Together with Danuta Hubner and Tadeusz Pieronek, Muszyński coauthored a reflection on the integration of Polish Christianity into the European Union. This reflection persuaded many Polish rectors to become proponents of Poland&#x27;s accession to the European Union in 2004.
Historically, the Archbishop of Gniezno served simultaneously as the Primate of Poland. But when the reorganization of the Polish Church&#x27;s ecclesiastical structure severed the See from Warsaw, an exception was made to continue the long-standing tradition until the retirement of the Archbishop of Warsaw, who had previously been Archbishop of both cities. On 1 November 2006 Pope Benedict XVI sent a letter to Józef Glemp confirming that Cardinal Glemp would be the Primate of Poland until 18 December 2009, his 80th birthday.

According to controversial records saved in Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, since 1985 to 1989 Henryk Muszyński was registered as secret collaborator of communist Służba Bezpieczeństwa, however he did not agree to this and not even know about that fact, and that his superiors where informed about all talks with communist authorities. Muszyński expressed regret that he could not refuse such talks.

Archbishop Muszynski has sought to constantly improve relations with Jews and Germans. In 1999, he received the Buber-Rosenzweig-Medal for his contributions to Christian–Jewish understanding. He was praised by Pope Benedict XVI for doing this in 2005.

<doc id="429190" wikidata="Q1501025" url="?curid=429190" title="Utah War">
<text>The Utah War (1857–1858), also known as the Utah Expedition, the Utah Campaign, Buchanan&#x27;s Blunder, the Mormon War, or the Mormon Rebellion, was an armed confrontation between Mormon settlers in the Utah Territory and the armed forces of the US government. The confrontation lasted from May 1857 to July 1858. The conflict primarily involved Mormon settlers and federal troops, escalating from tensions over governance and autonomy within the territory. There were several casualties, predominantly non-Mormon civilians. Although the war featured no significant military battles, it included the Mountain Meadows Massacre, where Mormon militia members disarmed and murdered about 120 settlers traveling to California.

The resolution of the Utah War came through negotiations that permitted federal troops to enter Utah Territory in exchange for a pardon granted to the Mormon settlers for any potential acts of rebellion. This settlement significantly reduced the tensions and allowed for the re-establishment of federal authority over the territory while largely preserving Mormon interests and autonomy. At the same time the conflict was widely seen as a disaster for President Buchanan, who many felt botched the situation, and it became known as &quot;Buchanan&#x27;s Blunder&quot; in later years. Many believe the war along with Buchanan&#x27;s failings contributed to the rising tensions that would lead to the Civil War in 1861.

== Overview ==

In 1857–1858, President James Buchanan sent U.S. forces to the Utah Territory in what became known as the Utah Expedition. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), also known as Mormons or Latter-day Saints, fearful that the large U.S. military force had been sent to annihilate them and having faced persecution in other areas, made preparations for defense. Though bloodshed was to be avoided, and the U.S. government also hoped that its purpose might be attained without the loss of life, both sides prepared for war. The Mormons manufactured or repaired firearms, prepared war scythes, and burnished and sharpened long-unused sabers.

Rather than engaging the Army directly, the Mormon strategy was one of hindering and weakening them. Daniel H. Wells, Lieutenant-General of the Nauvoo Legion, instructed Major Joseph Taylor:

On ascertaining the locality or route of the troops, proceed at once to annoy them in every possible way. Use every exertion to stampede their animals and set fire to their trains. Burn the whole country before them and on their flanks. Keep them from sleeping by night surprises; blockade the road by felling trees or destroying the river fords where you can. Watch for opportunities to set fire to the grass on their windward so as, if possible, to envelop their trains. Leave no grass before them that can be burned. Keep your men concealed as much as possible, and guard against surprise.

The Mormons blocked the army&#x27;s entrance into the Salt Lake Valley, and weakened the U.S. Army by hindering them from receiving provisions.

The confrontation between the Mormon militia, called the Nauvoo Legion, and the U.S. Army involved some destruction of property and a few brief skirmishes in what is today southwestern Wyoming, but no battles occurred between the contending military forces.

At the height of the tensions, on September 11, 1857, at least 120 California-bound settlers from Arkansas, Missouri and other states, including unarmed men, women, and children, were killed in remote southwestern Utah by a group of local Mormon militia. The Mormon militia responsible for the massacre first claimed that the migrants were killed by Natives but it was proven otherwise. This event was later called the Mountain Meadows Massacre, and the motives behind the incident remain unclear.

The Aiken Massacre took place the following month. In October 1857, Mormons arrested six Californians traveling through Utah and charged them with being spies for the U.S. Army. They were released but were later murdered and robbed of their stock and $25,000.

Other incidents of violence have also been linked to the Utah War, including a Native American attack on the Mormon mission of Fort Lemhi in eastern Oregon Territory, modern-day Idaho. They killed two Mormons and wounded several others. The historian Brigham Madsen notes, &quot;[T]he responsibility for the [Fort Limhi raid] lay mainly with the Bannock.&quot; David Bigler concludes that the raid was probably caused by members of the Utah Expedition who were trying to replenish their stores of livestock that had been stolen by Mormon raiders.

Taking all incidents into account, William MacKinnon estimated that approximately 150 people died as a direct result of the year-long Utah War, including the 120 migrants killed at Mountain Meadows. He points out that this was close to the number of people killed during the seven-year contemporaneous struggle in &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;.

In the end, negotiations between the United States and the Latter-day Saints resulted in a full pardon for the Latter-day Saints (except those involved in the Mountain Meadows murders), the transfer of Utah&#x27;s governorship from church president Brigham Young to non-Mormon Alfred Cumming, and the peaceful entrance of the U.S. Army into Utah.

==Background==

===Exodus to the Utah Territory===

Mormons began settling in what is now Utah (then part of Alta California in the Centralist Republic of Mexico) in the summer of 1847. Mormon pioneers began leaving the United States for Utah after a series of severe conflicts with neighboring communities in Missouri and Illinois resulted, in 1844, in the death of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement.

Brigham Young and other LDS Church leaders believed that the isolation of Utah would secure the rights of Mormons and would ensure the free practice of their religion. Although the United States had gained control of the settled parts of Alta California and Nuevo México in 1846 in the early stages of the Mexican–American War, legal transfer of the Mexican Cession to the U.S. came only with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ending the war in 1848. LDS Church leaders understood that they were not &quot;leaving the political orbit of the United States&quot;, nor did they want to. When gold was discovered in California in 1848 at Sutter&#x27;s Mill, which sparked the famous California Gold Rush, thousands of migrants began moving west on trails that passed directly through territory settled by Mormon pioneers. Although the migrants brought opportunities for trade, they also ended the Mormons&#x27; short-lived isolation.

In 1849, the Mormons proposed that a large part of the territory that they inhabited be incorporated into the United States as the State of Deseret. Their primary concern was to be governed by men of their own choosing rather than &quot;unsympathetic carpetbag appointees&quot;, who they believed would be sent from Washington, D.C. if their region were given territorial status, as was customary. They believed that only through a state run by church leadership could they maintain their religious freedom. The U.S. Congress created the Utah Territory as part of the Compromise of 1850. President Millard Fillmore selected Brigham Young, the LDS Church&#x27;s president, as the first governor of the Territory. The Mormons were pleased by the appointment, but gradually the amicable relationship between Mormons and the federal government broke down.

===Polygamy, popular sovereignty, and slavery===


During this period, the leadership of the LDS Church supported polygamy, which Mormons called &quot;plural marriage&quot;. An estimated 20% to 25% of Latter-day Saints were members of polygamous households, with the practice involving approximately one-third of Mormon women who reached marriageable age. The Mormons in territorial Utah viewed plural marriage as religious doctrine until 1890, when it was removed as an official practice of the church by Wilford Woodruff.

However, the rest of American society rejected polygamy, and some commentators accused the Mormons of gross immorality. During the Presidential election of 1856 a key plank of the newly formed Republican Party&#x27;s platform was a pledge &quot;to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism: polygamy and slavery&quot;. The Republicans associated the Democratic principle of popular sovereignty with the party&#x27;s acceptance of polygamy in Utah and turned this accusation into a formidable political weapon.

Popular sovereignty was the theoretical basis of the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854. This concept was meant to remove the divisive issue of slavery in the Territories from the national debate, allowing local decision-making and forestalling armed conflict between the North and South. But during the campaign, the Republican Party denounced the theory as protecting polygamy. Such leading Democrats as Stephen A. Douglas, formerly an ally of the Latter-day Saints began to denounce Mormonism in order to save the concept of popular sovereignty for issues related to slavery. The Democrats believed that American attitudes toward polygamy had the potential of derailing the compromise on slavery. For the Democrats, attacks on Mormonism had the dual purpose of disentangling polygamy from popular sovereignty and distracting the nation from the ongoing battles over slavery.

In March 1852, the Utah Territory passed Acts that legalized black slavery and Indian slavery.

===Theodemocracy===

Many east-coast politicians, such as U.S. President James Buchanan, were alarmed by the semi-theocratic dominance of the Utah Territory under Brigham Young. Young had been appointed territorial Governor by Millard Fillmore.

In addition to popular election, many early LDS Church leaders received quasi-political administrative appointments at both the territorial and federal level that coincided with their ecclesiastical roles, including the powerful probate judges. In analogy to the federal procedure, these executive and judicial appointments were confirmed by the Territorial Legislature, which largely consisted of popularly elected Latter-day Saints. Additionally, LDS Church leaders counseled Latter-day Saints to use ecclesiastical arbitration to resolve disputes among church members before resorting to the more explicit legal system. Both President Buchanan and the U.S. Congress saw these acts as obstructing, if not subverting, the operation of legitimate institutions of the United States.

Numerous newspaper articles continued sensationalizing Mormon beliefs and exaggerated earlier accounts of conflicts with frontier settlers. These stories led many Americans to believe that Mormon leaders were petty tyrants and that Mormons were determined to create a Zionist, polygamous kingdom in the newly acquired territories.

Many felt that these sensationalized beliefs, along with early communitarian practices of the United Order, also violated the principles of republicanism as well as the philosophy of laissez-faire economics. James Strang, a rival to Brigham Young who also claimed succession to the leadership of the church after Joseph Smith&#x27;s death, elevated these fears by proclaiming himself a king and resettling his followers on Beaver Island in Lake Michigan, after the main body of the LDS Church had fled to Utah.

People also believed that Brigham Young maintained power through a paramilitary organization called the Danites. The Danites were formed by a group of Mormons in Missouri in 1838. Most scholars believe that following the end of the Mormon War in the winter of 1838, the unit was partially disbanded. These factors contributed to the popular belief that Mormons &quot;were oppressed by a religious tyranny and kept in submission only by some terroristic arm of the Church ... [However] no Danite band could have restrained the flight of freedom-loving men from a Territory possessed of many exits; yet a flood of emigrants poured &quot;into&quot; Utah each year, with only a trickle ... ebbing back.&quot;

===Federal appointees===
These circumstances were not helped by the relationship between &quot;Gentile&quot; (non-Mormon) federal appointees and the Mormon territorial leadership. The territory&#x27;s Organic Act held that the governor, federal judges, and other important territorial positions were to be filled by appointees chosen by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, but without any reference to the will of Utah&#x27;s population—as was standard for all territorial administration.

Some federal officials sent by the President maintained essentially harmonious relationships with the Mormons. For instance, from 1853 to 1855, the territorial supreme court was composed of two non-Mormons and one Mormon. However, both of these non-Mormons were well respected in the Latter-day Saint community and were genuinely mourned for their deaths. Others had severe difficulties adjusting to the Mormon-dominated territorial government and the unique Mormon culture. Historian Norman Furniss writes that although some of these appointees were basically honest and well-meaning, many were highly prejudiced against the Mormons even before they arrived in the territory and woefully unqualified for their positions, while a few were down-right reprobates.

On the other hand, the Mormons had no patience for the federal domination entailed by territorial status and often showed defiance toward the representatives of the federal government. In addition, the Saints sincerely declared their loyalty to the United States and celebrated the Fourth of July every year with unabashed patriotism, but they were undisguisedly critical of the federal government, which they felt had driven them out from their homes in the east. Like the contemporary abolitionists, Latter-day Saint leaders declared that the judgments of God would be meted out upon the nation for its unrighteousness. Brigham Young echoed the opinion of many Latter-day Saints when he declared &quot;I love the government and the Constitution of the United States, but I do not love the damned rascals that administer the government.&quot;

The Mormons also maintained a governmental and legal regime in &quot;Zion&quot;, which they believed was perfectly permissible under the Constitution, but which was fundamentally different from that espoused in the rest of the country.

The Latter-day Saints and federal appointees in the Territory faced continual dispute. These conflicts regarded relations with the Indians (who often differentiated between &quot;Americans&quot; and &quot;Mormons&quot;), acceptance of the common law, the criminal jurisdiction of probate courts, the Mormon use of ecclesiastical courts rather than the federal court system for civil matters, the legitimacy of land titles, water rights, and various other issues. Many of the federal officers were also appalled by the practice of polygamy and the Mormon belief system in general and would harangue the Mormons for their &quot;lack of morality&quot; in public addresses. This already tense situation was further exacerbated by a period of intense religious revival starting in late 1856 dubbed the &quot;Mormon Reformation&quot;.

Beginning in 1851, a number of federal officers, some claiming that they feared for their physical safety, left their Utah appointments for the east. The stories of these &quot;Runaway Officials&quot; convinced the new President that the Mormons were nearing a state of rebellion against the authority of the United States. According to LDS historians James B. Allen and Glen M. Leonard, the most influential information came from William W. Drummond, an associate justice of the Utah territorial supreme court who began serving in 1854. Drummond&#x27;s letter of resignation of March 30, 1857, contained charges that Young&#x27;s power set aside the rule of law in the territory, that the Mormons had ignored the laws of Congress and the Constitution, and that male Mormons acknowledged no law but the priesthood.

This account was further supported by Territorial Chief Justice Kinney in reports to Washington, where he recited examples of what he believed to be Brigham Young&#x27;s perversion of Utah&#x27;s judicial system and further urged his removal from office and the establishment of a one-regiment U.S. Army garrison in the territory. There were further charges of treason, battery, theft, and fraud made by other officials, including Federal Surveyors and Federal Indian Agents. Furniss states that most federal reports from Utah to Washington &quot;left unclear whether the [Mormons] habitually kicked their dogs; otherwise, their calendar of infamy in Utah was complete&quot;.

As early as 1852, Dr. John M. Bernhisel, Utah&#x27;s Mormon delegate to Congress, had suggested that an impartial committee be sent to investigate the actual conditions in the territory. This call for an investigation was renewed during the crisis of 1857 by Bernhisel and even by Senator Stephen A. Douglas. However, the President would not wait. Under massive popular and political pressure, President Buchanan decided to take decisive action against the Mormons soon after his inauguration on March 4, 1857.

President Buchanan first decided to appoint a new governor in place of Brigham Young. The position was offered to several individuals who refused, and the President finally settled on Alfred Cumming during the summer. While Young became aware of the change in territorial administration through press reports and other sources, he received no official notification of his replacement until Cumming arrived in the Territory in November 1857. Buchanan also decided to send a force of 2,500 army troops to build a post in Utah and to act as a posse comitatus once the new governor had been installed. They were ordered not to take offensive action against the Mormons but to enter the territory, enforce the laws under the direction of the new governor, and defend themselves if attacked.

===July–November 1857: tactical standoff===

====Preparations====
Although the Utah Expedition had begun to gather as early as May under orders from General Winfield Scott, the first soldiers did not leave Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, until 18 July 1857. The troops were originally led by Gen. William S. Harney. However, affairs in &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; forced Harney to remain behind to deal with skirmishes between pro-slavery and free-soiler militants. The Expedition&#x27;s cavalry, the 2nd Dragoons, was kept in Kansas for the same reason. Because of Harney&#x27;s unavailability, Col. Edmund Alexander was charged with the first detachment of troops headed for Utah. However, the overall command was assigned to Col. Albert Sidney Johnston, who did not leave Kansas until much later. As it was, July was already far into the campaigning season, and the army and their supply train were unprepared for winter in the Rocky Mountains. The army was not given instructions on how to react in case of resistance.

The Mormons&#x27; lack of information on the army&#x27;s mission created apprehension and led to their defensive preparations. While rumors spread during the spring that an army was coming to Utah and Brigham Young had been replaced as governor, this was not confirmed until late July. Mormon mail contractors, including Porter Rockwell and Abraham O. Smoot, received word in Missouri that their contract was canceled and that the Army was on the move. The men quickly returned to Salt Lake City and notified Brigham Young that U.S. Army units were marching on the Mormons. Young announced the approach of the army to a large group of Latter-day Saints gathered in Big Cottonwood Canyon for Pioneer Day celebrations on 24 July.

Young disagreed with Buchanan&#x27;s choices for governor of the territory. Although Young&#x27;s secular position simplified his administration of the Territory, he believed his religious authority was more important among a nearly homogeneous population of Mormons. Young and the Mormon community feared renewed persecution and possibly annihilation by a large body of federal troops. Mormons remembered previous conflicts when they had lived near numerous non-Mormons. In 1838, they were driven from Missouri into Illinois under the direction of the Governor of Missouri, who issued the infamous Extermination Order. Mormons&#x27; state of mind was further alarmed when they learned in late June 1857 that LDS Apostle Parley P. Pratt had recently been murdered while serving a mission in Arkansas.

Fearing the worst, Young ordered residents throughout Utah territory to prepare for evacuation, making plans to burn their homes and property and stockpile food and stock feed. Guns were manufactured, and ammunition was cast. Mormon colonists in small outlying communities in the Carson Valley and San Bernardino, California were ordered to leave their homes to consolidate with the main body of Latter-day Saints in Northern and Central Utah. All LDS missionaries serving in the United States and Europe were recalled. Young also sent George A. Smith to the settlements of southern Utah to prepare them for action. Young&#x27;s strategies to defend the Saints vacillated between all-out war, a more limited confrontation, and retreat.
An alliance with the Indians was central to Young&#x27;s strategy for war, although his relations with them had been strained since the settlers&#x27; arrival in 1847. Young had generally adopted a policy of conversion and conciliation towards native tribes. Some Mormon leaders encouraged intermarriage with the Indians so that the two peoples might &quot;unite together&quot; and their &quot;interests become one&quot;.
Between August 30 and September 1, Young met with Indian delegations and gave them permission to take all of the livestock then on the northern and southern trails into California (the Fancher Party was at that time on the southern trail). This meeting may have been Young&#x27;s attempt to win Indian support against the United States and refrain from raids against Mormon settlements. In sermons on August 16 and again one month later, Young publicly urged the emigrant wagon trains to keep away from the Territory. Despite Young&#x27;s efforts, Indians attacked Mormon settlements during the course of the Utah War, including a raid on Fort Limhi on the Salmon River in Oregon Territory in February 1858 and attacks in Tooele County just west of Great Salt Lake City.
In early August, Young re-activated the Nauvoo Legion. This was the Mormon militia created during the conflict in Illinois. The Nauvoo Legion was under the command of Daniel H. Wells and consisted of all able-bodied men between 15 and 60. Young ordered the Legion to take delaying actions, essentially harassing federal troops. He planned to buy time for the Mormon settlements to prepare for either battle or evacuation and create a window for negotiations with the Buchanan Administration. Thus, in mid-August, militia Colonel Robert T. Burton and a reconnaissance unit were sent east from Salt Lake City with orders to observe the oncoming American regiments and protect LDS emigrants traveling on the Mormon Trail.

====Captain Van Vliet====
On July 18, 1857, U.S. Army Captain Stewart Van Vliet, an assistant quartermaster, and a small escort were ordered to proceed directly from Kansas to Salt Lake City, ahead of the main body of troops. Van Vliet carried a letter to Young from General Harney ordering Young to make arrangements for the citizens of Utah to accommodate and supply the troops once they arrived. However, Harney&#x27;s letter did not mention that Young had been replaced as governor, nor did it detail what the mission of the troops would be once they arrived, and these omissions sparked even greater distrust among the Saints. On his journey, reports reached Van Vliet that his company might be in danger from Mormon raiders on the trail. The Captain, therefore, left his escort and proceeded alone.

Van Vliet arrived in Salt Lake City on September 8. Historian Harold Schindler states that his mission was to contact Governor Young and inform him of the expedition&#x27;s mission: to escort the new appointees, to act as a posse comitatus and to establish at least two and perhaps three new U.S. Army camps in Utah. Conversing with Van Vliet, Young denied complicity in the destruction of the law offices of U.S. Federal Judge Stiles and expressed concern that he (Young) might suffer the same fate as the previous Mormon leader, Joseph Smith, to which Van Vliet replied, &quot;I do not think it is the intention of the government to arrest you,&quot; said Van Vliet, &quot;but to install a new governor of the territory&quot;. Van Vliet&#x27;s instructions were to buy provisions for the troops and to inform the people of Utah that the troops would only be employed as a posse comitatus when called on by the civil authority to aid in the execution of the laws.

Van Vliet&#x27;s arrival in Salt Lake City was welcomed cautiously by the Mormon leadership. Van Vliet had been previously known by the Latter-day Saints in Iowa, and they trusted and respected him. However, he found the residents of Utah determined to defend themselves. He interviewed leaders and townspeople and &quot;attended Sunday services, heard emotional speeches, and saw the Saints raise their hands in a unanimous resolution to guard against any &#x27;invader. Van Vliet found it impossible to persuade resentful Mormon leaders that the Army had peaceful intentions. He quickly recognized that supplies or accommodations for the Army would not be forthcoming. But Young told Van Vliet that the Mormons did not desire war, and &quot;if we can keep the peace for this winter, I do think there will be something turned up that may save the shedding of blood&quot;. However, marking a change from earlier pronouncements, Young declared that under threat from an approaching army, he would not allow the new governor and federal officers to enter Utah. Nevertheless, Van Vliet told Young that he believed that the Mormons &quot;have been lied about the worst of any people I ever saw&quot;. He promised to stop the Utah Expedition on his own authority, and on September 14, he returned east through the Mormon fortifications then being built in Echo Canyon (see below).

Upon returning to the main body of the army, Van Vliet reported that the Latter-day Saints would not resort to actual hostilities but would seek to delay the troops in every way possible. He also reported that they were ready to burn their homes and destroy their crops and that the route through Echo Canyon would be a death trap for a large body of troops. Van Vliet continued on to Washington, D.C., in company with Dr. John M. Bernhisel, Utah Territory&#x27;s delegate to Congress. There, Van Vliet reported on the situation in the west and became an advocate for the Latter-day Saints and the end of the Utah War.

====Martial law====
As early as August 5, Young had decided to declare martial law throughout the Territory, and a document was printed to that effect. However, historians question the intent of this proclamation as it was never widely circulated, if at all, and while copies of the document exist, there is no mention of it in any contemporary sources. One commentary opines that &quot;during most of August, the Mormon leaders had not precisely focused on a strategy for dealing with the approaching army; and after the first proclamation was struck off, they likely had second thoughts about a direct confrontation with the federal government. On August 29, Brigham Young instructed Daniel H. Wells to draft a second proclamation of martial law.&quot;

On September 15, the day after Van Vliet left Salt Lake City, Young publicly declared martial law in Utah with a document almost identical to that printed in early August. This second proclamation received wide circulation throughout the Territory and was delivered by messenger to Col. Alexander with the approaching army. The most important provision forbade &quot;all armed forces of every description from coming into this Territory, under any pretense whatsoever&quot;. It also commanded that &quot;all the forces in said Territory hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment&#x27;s notice to repel any and all such invasion.&quot; But more important to California and Oregon bound travelers was the third section that stated &quot;Martial law is hereby declared to exist in this Territory ... and no person shall be allowed to pass or repass into, through or from this territory without a permit from the proper officer.&quot;

====Contact====
The Nauvoo Legion finally made contact with federal troops in late September just west of South Pass. The militia immediately began to burn grass along the trail and stampede the army&#x27;s cattle. In early October, Legion members burned down Fort Bridger lest it falls into the hands of the army. A few days later, three large Army supply trains that were trailing the main army detachments were burned by Mormon cavalry led by Lot Smith. Associated horses and cattle were &quot;liberated&quot; from the supply trains and taken west by the militia. Few if any shots were fired in these exchanges, and the Army&#x27;s lack of cavalry left them more or less open to Mormon raids. However, the army began to grow weary of the constant Mormon harassment throughout the fall. At one point, Colonel Alexander mounted roughly 100 men on army mules to combat the Mormon militia. In the early morning of 15 October, this &quot;jackass cavalry&quot; had a run-in with Lot Smith&#x27;s command and fired over 30 bullets at the Mormons from 150 yards. No one was killed, but one Mormon took a bullet through his hat band, and one horse was grazed.

Through October and November, between 1,200 and 2,000 militiamen were stationed in Echo Canyon and Weber Canyon. These two narrow passes lead into the Salt Lake Valley, and provided the easiest access to the populated areas of northern Utah. Dealing with a heavy snowfall and intense cold, the Mormon men built fortifications, dug rifle pits and dammed streams and rivers in preparation for a possible battle either that fall or the following spring. Several thousand more militiamen prepared their families for evacuation and underwent military training.

On October 16, Major Joseph Taylor and his Adjutant William Stowell of the Nauvoo Legion encountered a camp in the fog ahead of them. Supposing them to be the battalion of Lot Smith, they approached not realizing it was a detachment of US Army soldiers. They were captured and taken back to the main detachment where they were questioned by Col. Alexander. Taylor and Stowell gave exaggerated accounts of &quot;twenty-five to thirty thousand&quot; Mormon militia camped in Echo Canyon to repel the army if they were to pass through. The two men were held as prisoners at Camp Scott near Fort Bridger.

Colonel Alexander, whose troops referred to him as &quot;old granny&quot;, opted not to enter Utah through Echo Canyon following Van Vliet&#x27;s report, as well as news of the Mormon fortifications by Taylor and Stowell. Alexander instead maneuvered his troops around the Mormon defenses, entering Utah from the north along the Bear River before being forced to turn back upon running into a heavy blizzard in late October. Colonel Johnston took command of the combined U.S. forces in early November, by this time the command was hampered by a lack of supplies, animals, and the early onset of winter. Johnston was a more aggressive commander than Alexander but this predicament rendered him unable to immediately attack through Echo Canyon into Utah. Instead, he settled his troops into ill-equipped winter camps designated Camp Scott and Eckelsville, near the burned-out remains of Fort Bridger, now in the state of Wyoming. Johnston was soon joined by the 2nd Dragoons commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cooke, who had accompanied Alfred Cumming, Utah&#x27;s new governor, and a roster of other federal officials from Fort Leavenworth. However, they too were critically short of horses and supplies.

In early November, Joseph Taylor of the Nauvoo Legion escaped captivity at Camp Scott and returned to Salt Lake City to report conditions of the army to Brigham Young. On 21 November, Cumming sent a proclamation to the citizens of Utah declaring them to be in rebellion. On November 26, 1857, Brigham Young wrote letter to Colonel Johnston at Fort Bridger inquiring of the prisoners and stating of William &quot;...if you imagine that keeping, mistreating or killing Mr. Stowell will resound to your advantage, future experience may add to the stock of your better judgment.&quot;

At Eckelsville, Chief Justice Eckels and Governor Cumming set up a temporary seat of territorial government. Eckels convened a grand jury on December 30, which indicted twenty Mormons for high treason, including Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Daniel H. Wells, John Taylor, George D. Grant, Lot Smith, Orrin Porter Rockwell, William A. Hickman, Albert Carrington, Joseph Taylor, Robert Burton, James Ferguson, Ephraim Hanks, and William Stowell, among others. On January 5, 1858, Justice Eckels held a court proceeding where William Stowell was arraigned in person on behalf of all of the defendants on charges of high treason. Stowell pled not guilty and requested more time to prepare for trial. Johnston awaited resupply and reinforcement and prepared to attack the Mormon positions after the spring thaw.

===December 1857 – March 1858: winter intermission===

====Soldiers advance up the Colorado River====
During this winter season, Lt. Joseph Christmas Ives was embarking on an assigned task of exploring and surveying the Colorado River by steamship to determine the extent of the river&#x27;s navigability. While steaming upstream in the Explorer from the Colorado River Delta toward Fort Yuma in early January 1858, Ives received two hastily written dispatches from his commanding officer informing him of the outbreak of the Mormon War. These letters reported that Mormons were already engaged in hostilities with United States Army forces who were attempting to enter Utah from the east, and Ives&#x27;s expedition took on a new meaning. The War Department was now considering launching a second front in Utah via the Colorado. Ives, who had anticipated a leisurely ascent of the river, was instructed to disregard his original orders. He was now ordered to ascend the Colorado to the head of navigation with utmost speed to determine the feasibility of transporting troops and war material up the Colorado by steamer to the mouth of the Virgin River, and thence overland to Utah. It was also rumored in Washington that Mormons might try to retreat down the Colorado River and into Sonora. An army advancing up the Colorado River would cut off this escape route. Ives was instructed to proceed with extreme caution, since treacherous Mormons might already be lurking on the Colorado above Yuma.

Meanwhile, George Alonzo Johnson, a merchant who had an established business transporting goods by steamship between the Colorado River Delta and Fort Yuma, was upset that he had not been awarded command of the expedition&#x27;s original exploratory mission. When Ives was chosen instead, he used the rumors of Indian unrest and purported Mormon designs on the Colorado river and successfully organized a second armed expedition in competition with Ives. He obtained an escort of soldiers commanded by Lt. James A. White from Fort Yuma&#x27;s acting commander, Lt. A. A. Winder. On December 31, 1857, several days before Ives&#x27;s arrival at Fort Yuma, Johnson&#x27;s party steamed upstream from Yuma aboard the steamer &quot;General Jesup&quot;.

Ives arrived at Yuma on the evening of January 5, 1858. Reacting to Johnson&#x27;s departure and urgent dispatches from Washington, Ives had taken an overland shortcut on horseback in order to reorganize his command prior to the steamer&#x27;s arrival and to facilitate a rapid ascent to the Virgin River as commanded. Ives&#x27; party steamed up the Colorado River with frequent contact with Mojaves and other natives who traded with them and were allowed to board their vessel. Determining that they could not ascend the river beyond Black Canyon they turned back downstream. During their descent, the Mojave informed Ives that Mormons had recently been among the Mojaves and were inciting unrest by intimating that the real purpose of the river expedition was to steal Indian lands.

Upon hearing of Ives&#x27;s steamer on the Colorado, Mormons feared that Ives might be bringing an army to Utah from the South. Jacob Hamblin, famed Mormon missionary of the Southwest, whose activities including establishing and maintaining Mormon–Indian alliances along the Colorado, set out in March with three other companions from Las Vegas to learn more about Ives&#x27;s intentions. From excited Indians they learned of the approach of an &quot;army&quot; marching overland from Yuma – which in reality was Ives&#x27;s packtrain.

Hamblin&#x27;s group made direct contact with Ives expedition by sending Thaïes Haskell, to hail the steamer&#x27;s crew from the bank while the other Mormons remained in hiding. He was to pass himself off as a renegade from Utah and then learn as much as possible about Ives&#x27;s intentions; however, his guise failed since one of Ives&#x27;s men who had been to Utah claimed to recognize him as a Mormon bishop.

The journals of members of the Ives expedition as well as the Mormons from Hamblin&#x27;s group attest to the tension and war hysteria among both the US Army and the Mormons in these remote territories.

====Thomas L. Kane====

The lull in hostilities during the winter provided an opportunity for negotiations, and direct confrontation was avoided. As early as August 1857, Brigham Young had written to Thomas L. Kane of Pennsylvania asking for help. Kane was a man of some political prominence who had been helpful to the Mormons in their westward migration and later political controversies. In December, Kane contacted President Buchanan and offered to mediate between the Mormons and the federal government. In Buchanan&#x27;s State of the Union address earlier in the month, he had taken a hard stand against the Mormon rebellion, and had actually asked Congress to enlarge the size of the regular army to deal with the crisis. However, in his conversation with Kane, Buchanan worried that the Mormons might destroy Johnston&#x27;s Army at severe political cost to himself, and stated that he would pardon the Latter-day Saints for their actions if they would submit to government authority. He therefore granted Kane unofficial permission to attempt mediation, although he held little hope for the success of negotiations. Upon approval of his mission by the President, Kane immediately started for Utah. During the heavy winter of 1857–1858, he traveled under the alias &quot;Dr. Osborne&quot; over 3,000 miles from the East coast to Utah, first by ship to Panama, crossing the isthmus via the newly constructed (1855) the Panama Railway, and then taking a second ship to San Francisco. Upon learning that the Sierra passes were blocked for the winter, he immediately took a ship to San Pedro, the unimproved harbor for what is now Los Angeles. He was met there by Mormons who took him overland through San Bernardino and Las Vegas, to Salt Lake City on the strenuous southern branch of the California Trail, arriving in February 1858.

When Kane arrived in February 1858, Mormons referred to him as &quot;the man the Lord had raised up as a peacemaker&quot;. Details of the negotiations between Kane and Young are unclear. It seems that Kane successfully convinced Young to accept Buchanan&#x27;s appointment of Cumming as Territorial governor, although Young had expressed his willingness to accept such terms at the very beginning of the crisis. It is uncertain if Kane was able to convince Young at this time to allow the army into Utah. After his meeting with Brigham Young, Kane traveled to Camp Scott arriving on March 10, 1858. After deliberations, Governor Cumming and a small non-military escort which included Thomas Kane, left Camp Scott on April 5 and traveled to Salt Lake to formally install the new Governor. Governor Cumming was welcomed to Utah by &quot;its most distinguished citizens&quot; on April 12, 1858 and was shortly installed in his new office. Three days later, word was sent to Colonel Johnston that the Governor had been properly received by the people and was able to fully discharge his duties as Governor.

After spending some time in Salt Lake City, Governor Cumming made the return trip back to Eckelsville, departing Salt Lake on May 16. He met with military commanders and new authorities to make plans to travel into the valley. At the end of May, Major Benjamin McCulloch of Texas and Kentucky senator-elect Lazarus W. Powell arrived at Camp Scott as peace commissioners with a proclamation of general pardon from President Buchanan for previous indictments handed down to Mormon leaders. As the Governor and his military escort descended Echo Canyon to Salt Lake city, many of the Mormon militia men including now released prisoner William Stowell, successfully fooled Cumming as to the size of the armed contingent lining the canyon. Mormon militia men marched in front of camp fires in circles at night to make it appear there were many shadows. When Cumming approached an encampment, the heavy set Governor lumbered over to speak to the saluting men telling them the conflict was over and they could return to their families. After each meeting, Cumming would travel with his escort to the next encampment down Echo Canyon to give the same address, not realizing many of the men had run through the dark ahead of the Governor with a small change of costume from the last encampment, making their numbers appear much larger than they were. Many of the Mormon militia men heard the Governor speech multiple times without being detected by Cumming.

The new Governor was courteously received by Young and the Utah citizenry in the first week of June 1858. Cumming thereafter became a moderate voice, and opposed the hardline against the Mormons proposed by Colonel Johnston and other federal officials traveling with the army to be installed in the territory. Kane left Utah for Washington, D.C. in May to report to President Buchanan on the results of his mission.

===April–July 1858: resolution===

====Move south====

Despite Thomas Kane&#x27;s successful mission, tension continued throughout the spring and summer of 1858. Young was willing to support Cumming as governor, but he still feared persecution and violence if the army entered Utah. Indeed, as the snows melted, approximately 3,000 additional U.S. Army reinforcements set out on the westward trails to resupply and strengthen the Army&#x27;s presence.

In Utah, the Nauvoo Legion was bolstered as Mormon communities were asked to supply and equip an additional thousand volunteers to be placed in the over one hundred miles of mountains that separated Camp Scott and Great Salt Lake City. Nevertheless, by the end of the winter Young had decided to enforce his &quot;Sevastopol Policy&quot;, a plan to evacuate the Territory and burn it to the ground rather than fight the army openly. Members of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the British government feared that the Mormons planned to seek refuge on Vancouver Island off the coast of British Columbia.

David Bigler has shown that Young originally intended this evacuation to go northwards toward the Bitterroot Valley in present-day Montana. He believed conditions there were sufficient for the Mormons to live, but difficult enough that others would be discouraged from following them or settling there. However, the Bannock and Shoshone raid against Fort Limhi in February 1858 blocked this northern retreat. Consequently, at the end of March 1858, settlers in the northern counties of Utah including Salt Lake City boarded up their homes and farms and began to move south, leaving small groups of men and boys behind to burn the settlements if necessary. As early as February 1858, Young had sent parties to explore the White Mountains on what is now the Utah/Nevada border where he, erroneously, believed there were valleys that could comfortably harbor up to 100,000 individuals. Residents of Utah County just south of Salt Lake were asked to build and maintain roads and to help the incoming inhabitants of the northern communities. Mormon Elias Blackburn recorded in his journal, &quot;The roads are crowded with the Saints moving south. ... Very busy dealing out provisions to the public hands. I am feeding 100 men, all hard at work.&quot; Even after Alfred Cumming was installed as governor in mid-April, the &quot;Move South&quot; continued unabated. The movement may have included the relocation of nearly 30,000 people between March and July. Historians Allen and Leonard write:

== Utah War Peace Commission ==


In the meantime, President Buchanan had come under considerable pressure from Congress to end the crisis. In February 1858, Senator Sam Houston of Texas stated that a war against the Mormons would be

On April 1, Senator Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania declared that he would support a bill to authorize volunteers to fight in Utah and other parts of the frontier only because

Therefore in April, the President sent an official peace commission to Utah consisting of Benjamin McCulloch and Lazarus Powell, which arrived in June. The commission offered a free pardon to the Mormons for any acts incident to the conflict if they would submit to government authority. This included permitting Johnston&#x27;s Army into the Territory. The commissioners further assured that the government would not interfere with their religion. They also hinted that once the new governor was installed and the laws yielded to, &quot;a necessity will no longer exist to retain any portion of the army in the Territory, except what may be required to keep the Indians in check and to secure the passage of emigrants to California.&quot; While all these private assurances were inducements for the Latter-day Saints to bend to federal will, Buchanan maintained a tougher stance in his public statements.

Brigham Young accepted Buchanan&#x27;s terms and pardon, although he denied Utah had ever rebelled against the United States. Buchanan&#x27;s proclamation was also unpopular among the Mormon rank and file. Arthur P. Welchman, a member of a company of missionaries that was recalled due to the war, wrote of the document:

On June 19, a newly arrived reporter for the &quot;New York Herald&quot; somewhat inaccurately wrote, &quot;Thus was peace made – thus was ended the &#x27;Mormon war&#x27;, which ... may be thus historicized: – Killed, none; wounded, none; fooled, everybody.&quot; At the end of June 1858, the Army troops under General Johnston entered the Salt Lake Valley unhindered. Riding through the still empty streets of Salt Lake City on June 26, an embittered Johnston was heard to say that he would have given &quot;his plantation for a chance to bombard the city for fifteen minutes&quot;. Lt. Col. Charles Ferguson Smith stated that he &quot;did not care a damn who heard him; he would like to see every dammed Mormon hung by the neck.&quot; Philip St. George Cooke, who had led the Mormon Battalion during the Mexican War, merely bared his head in respect.

In early July, the Mormons from the northern settlements began to return to their homes after it was clear that no more reinforcements were being sent into Utah from either the east or west. Johnston&#x27;s Army settled in Camp Floyd, in a valley 50 miles southwest of Salt Lake City and separated from Provo (the second-largest city in the territory) by Utah Lake and a small range of mountains. This remote location, neighbor only to a few farms and ranches, was chosen to decrease friction between the troops and the Mormons. The Army and the Mormons continued in a fragile co-existence until the troops left in 1861 when called back east for service in the American Civil War.

==Consequences==
Although Eastern editors continued to condemn the Mormons&#x27; religious beliefs and practices, they praised their heroism in the face of military threat. By the time Governor Cumming was securely placed in office, the Utah War had become an embarrassment for President Buchanan. Called &#x27;Buchanan&#x27;s Blunder&#x27; by elements of the national press, the President was criticized for:
* failing to officially notify Governor Young about his replacement,
* incurring the expense of sending troops without investigating the reports on Utah&#x27;s disloyalty to the United States,
* dispatching the expedition late in the season, and
* failing to provide an adequate resupply train for the winter.

However, the people of Utah lost much during the brief period of conflict. Largely due to their evacuation, the settlers&#x27; livelihoods and economic well-being were seriously impacted for at least that year and perhaps longer. Field crops had been ignored for most of the two-month-long planting season and livestock herds had been culled for the journey. A year&#x27;s worth of work improving their living conditions had essentially been lost. Some poverty would be widespread in the territory for several years. A number of Mormon settlements in Idaho, Nevada and California would not be resettled for decades and some were permanently abandoned.

In addition, Utah was under nominal military occupation. Historian Leonard J. Arrington noted that &quot;the cream of the United States Army&quot; reviled the Mormon settlers. Relations between the troops and their commanders with the Mormons were often tense. Fortunately, the near isolation of Camp Floyd kept interaction to a minimum, as troops stayed on or near their base. Settlers living near the 7,000 troops quartered in Cedar Valley did sell the troops lumber for building construction, farm produce and manufactured goods. When the army finally abandoned Camp Floyd in 1861 at the outbreak of the American Civil War, surplus goods worth an estimated four million dollars were auctioned off for a fraction of their value. However, in 1862, new troops arrived and built Fort Douglas in the foothills east of Salt Lake City.

One consequence of the Utah War was the creation of the famous Pony Express. During the war, Lot Smith and the Nauvoo Legion burned roughly 52 wagons belonging to outfitters Russell, Majors and Waddell. The government never reimbursed the outfitters for these losses, and in 1860 they formed the Pony Express to earn a government mail contract to keep them from falling into bankruptcy.

In the aftermath of the Utah War, Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 1858. But every significant bill that they passed fell before the votes of southern Democratic Senators or suffered a presidential veto. The federal government remained stalemated and little could be done. By 1860, sectional strife split the Democratic Party into northern and southern wings, indirectly leading to the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860. Popular sovereignty, the defense of which had been a major cause of the Utah Expedition, was finally repudiated when the resolution of the slavery question sparked the American Civil War. Yet with the start of the Civil War, Republican majorities were able to pass legislation meant to curb the Mormon practice of polygamy such as the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act of 1862. However, President Abraham Lincoln did not enforce these laws; instead, Lincoln gave Brigham Young permission to ignore the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act in exchange for not becoming involved with the American Civil War. General Patrick Edward Connor, commanding officer of the federal forces garrisoned at Fort Douglas, Utah beginning in 1862 was explicitly instructed to not confront the Mormons. In March 1863, Judge Kinney issued a writ against Young for violation of the Suppression of Polygamy Act. The writ was served by the United States marshal and the prisoner promptly appeared at the state-house where an investigation was held. A $2,000 bail bond was posted awaiting the decision of the grand jury. The all Mormon grand jury refused an indictment citing a lack of evidence for Young&#x27;s marriage to Amelia Folsom in January of that year.

In the end, the Utah War started a slow decline for Mormon isolation and power in Utah. The Latter-day Saints lost control of the executive branch and the federal district courts, but maintained political authority in the Territorial Legislature and the powerful probate courts. In 1869, the Transcontinental Railroad was completed, and soon large numbers of &quot;Gentiles&quot; arrived in Utah to stay. Despite this, complete federal dominance was slow in coming. Conflict between the Mormons and the federal government, particularly over the issue of polygamy, would continue for nearly 40 years before Utah was finally made a state in 1896, and was perhaps not fully resolved until the Smoot Hearings of 1904–1907.

<text>[[Gamut|Typical [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) gamut]]
The grayed-out horseshoe shape is the entire range of possible [[chromaticity|chromaticities]], displayed in the [[CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram]] format (see below). The colored triangle is the gamut available to the [[sRGB]] color space typically used in computer monitors; it does not cover the entire space. The corners of the triangle are the [[primary color]]s for this gamut; in the case of a CRT, they depend on the colors of the phosphors of the monitor. At each point, the brightest possible RGB color of that chromaticity is shown, resulting in the bright [[Mach band]] stripes corresponding to the edges of the [[RGB color cube]].

In color reproduction and colorimetry, a gamut, or color gamut , is a convex set containing the colors that can be accurately represented, i.e. reproduced by an output device (e.g. printer or display) or measured by an input device (e.g. camera or visual system). Devices with a larger gamut can represent more colors. Similarly, gamut may also refer to the colors within a defined color space, which is not linked to a specific device. A trichromatic gamut is often visualized as a color triangle. A less common usage defines gamut as the subset of colors contained within an image, scene or video.

==Introduction==
The term &quot;gamut&quot; was adopted from the field of music, where the medieval Latin expression &quot;gamma ut&quot; meant the lowest tone of the G scale and, in time, came to imply the entire range of musical notes of which musical melodies are composed. Shakespeare&#x27;s use of the term in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; is sometimes attributed to the author / musician Thomas Morley. In the 1850s, the term was applied to a range of colors or hue, for example by Thomas de Quincey, who wrote &quot;Porphyry, I have heard, runs through as large a gamut of hues as marble.&quot;

The gamut of a device or process is that portion of the color space that can be represented, or reproduced. Generally, the color gamut is specified in the hue–saturation plane, as a system can usually produce colors over a wide intensity range within its color gamut.
Device gamuts must use real primaries (those that can be represented by a physical spectral power distribution) and therefore are always &quot;incomplete&quot; (smaller than the human visible gamut). No gamut defined by a finite number of primaries can represent the entire human visible gamut. Three primaries are necessary for representing an approximation of the human visible gamut. More primaries can be used to increase the size of the gamut. For example, while painting with red, yellow and blue pigments is sufficient for modeling color vision, adding further pigments (e.g. orange or green) can increase the size of the gamut, allowing the reproduction of more saturated colors.

While processing a digital image, the most convenient color model used is the RGB model. Printing the image requires transforming the image from the original RGB color model to the printer&#x27;s CMYK color model. During this process, the colors from the RGB model which are out of gamut must be somehow converted to approximate values within the CMYK model. Simply trimming only the colors which are out of gamut to the closest colors in the destination space would burn the image. There are several algorithms approximating this transformation, but none of them can be truly perfect, since those colors are simply out of the target device&#x27;s capabilities. This is why identifying the colors in an image that are out of gamut in the target color space as soon as possible during processing is critical for the quality of the final product. It is also important to remember that there are colors inside the CMYK gamut that are outside the most commonly used RGB color spaces, such as sRGB and Adobe RGB.

=== Color management ===
Color management is the process of ensuring consistent and accurate colors across devices with different gamuts. Color management handles the transformations between color gamuts and canonical color spaces to ensure that colors are represented equally on different devices. A device&#x27;s gamut is defined by a color profile, usually the ICC profile, which relates the gamut to a standardized color space and allows for calibration of the device. Transforming from one gamut to a smaller gamut loses information as &quot;out-of-gamut&quot; colors are projected on to the smaller gamut and transforming back to the larger gamut does not regain this lost information.

== Colorimetry ==

Colorimetry is the measurement of color, generally in a way that mimics human color perception. Input devices such as digital cameras or scanners are made to mimic trichromatic human color perception and are based on three sensors elements with different spectral sensitivities, ideally aligned approximately with the spectral sensitivities of human photopsins. In this sense, they have a similar gamut to the human visual system. However, most of these devices violate the Luther condition and are not intended to be truly colorimetric, with the exception of tristimulus colorimeters. Higher-dimension input devices, such as multispectral imagers, hyperspectral imagers or spectrometers, capture color at a much larger gamut, dimensionally, than the human visible gamut. To be perceived by humans, the images must first be down-dimensionalized and treated with false color.

=== Visible gamut ===

The extent of color that can be detected by the average human, approximated by the standard observer, is the &quot;humanly visible gamut&quot;. The visible gamut is usually visualized in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram, where the spectral locus (curved edge) represents the monochromatic (single-wavelength) or spectral colors. As the device you are using to view the diagram has a smaller gamut than the visible gamut, the colors that are out-of-gamut are reproduced as colors inside the display&#x27;s gamut. Device gamuts are generally depicted in reference to the visible gamut. The standard observer represents a typical human, but colorblindness leads to a reduced visible gamut.

===Limitations of color representation===
====Surfaces (optimal colors)====
Optimal colors are the most chromatic colors that surfaces can have*. The color solid bounded by the set of all optimal colors is called the optimal color solid or Rösch–MacAdam color solid. For now, we are unable to produce objects with such colors, at least not without recurring to more complex physical phenomena.

&quot;*(with classical reflection. Phenomena like fluorescence or structural color may produce objects whose color lies outside the optimal color solid)&quot;

The reflectance spectrum of a color is the amount of light of each wavelength that it reflects, in proportion to a given maximum, which has the value of 1 (100%). If the reflectance spectrum of a color is 0 (0%) or 1 (100%) across the entire visible spectrum, and it has no more than two transitions between 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, then it is an optimal color. With the current state of technology, we are unable to produce any material or pigment with these properties.

Thus four types of &quot;optimal color&quot; spectra are possible: 
* The transition goes from zero at both ends of the spectrum to one in the middle, as shown in the image at right. 
*It goes from one at the ends to zero in the middle.
*It goes from 1 at the start of the visible spectrum to 0 in some point in the middle until its end.
*It goes from 0 at the start of the visible spectrum to 1 at some point in the middle until its end. 

The first type produces colors that are similar to the spectral colors and follow roughly the horseshoe-shaped portion of the CIE xy chromaticity diagram (the spectral locus), but are, in surfaces, more chromatic, although less spectrally pure. The second type produces colors that are similar to (but, in surfaces, more chromatic and less spectrally pure than) the colors on the straight line in the CIE xy chromaticity diagram (the line of purples), leading to magenta or purple-like colors.

In optimal color solids, the colors of the visible spectrum are theoretically black, because their reflectance spectrum is 1 (100%) in only one wavelength, and 0 in all of the other infinite visible wavelengths that there are, meaning that they have a lightness of 0 with respect to white, and will also have 0 chroma, but, of course, 100% of spectral purity. In short: In optimal color solids, spectral colors are equivalent to black (0 lightness, 0 chroma), but have full spectral purity (they are located in the horseshoe-shaped spectral locus of the chromaticiy diagram).

In linear color spaces that contain all colors visible by humans, such as LMS or CIE 1931 XYZ, the set of half-lines that start at the origin (black, (0, 0, 0)) and pass through all the points that represent the colors of the visible spectrum, and the portion of a plane that passes through the violet half-line and the red half-line (both ends of the visible spectrum), generate the &quot;spectrum cone&quot;. The black point (coordinates (0, 0, 0)) of the optimal color solid (and only the black point) is tangent to the &quot;spectrum cone&quot;, and the white point ((1, 1, 1)) (only the white point) is tangent to the &quot;inverted spectrum cone&quot;, with the &quot;inverted spectrum cone&quot; being symmetrical to the &quot;spectrum cone&quot; with respect to the middle gray point ((0.5, 0.5, 0.5)). This means that, in linear color spaces, the optimal color solid is centrally symmetric.

In most color spaces, the surface of the optimal color solid is smooth, except for two points (black and white); and two sharp edges: the &quot;warm&quot; edge, which goes from black, to red, to orange, to yellow, to white; and the &quot;cold&quot; edge, which goes from black, to blue, to cyan, to white. This is due to the following: If the portion of the reflectance spectrum of a color is spectral red (which is located at one end of the spectrum), it will be seen as black. If the size of the portion of total or reflectance is increased, now covering from the red end of the spectrum to the yellow wavelengths, it will be seen as red. If the portion is expanded even more, covering the green wavelengths, it will be seen as orange or yellow. If it is expanded even more, it will cover more wavelengths than the yellow semichrome does, approaching white, until it is reached when the full spectrum is reflected. The described process is called &quot;cumulation&quot;. Cumulation can be started at either end of the visible spectrum (we just described cumulation starting from the red end of the spectrum, generating the &quot;warm&quot; sharp edge), cumulation starting at the violet end of the spectrum will generate the &quot;cold&quot; sharp edge.

===== Maximum chroma colors, semichromes, or full colors =====
Each hue has a maximum chroma point, semichrome, or full color; objects cannot have a color of that hue with a higher chroma. They are the most chromatic, vibrant colors that objects can have. They were called semichromes or full colors by the German chemist and philosopher Wilhelm Ostwald in the early 20th century.

If B is the complementary wavelength of wavelength A, then the straight line that connects A and B passes through the achromatic axis in a linear color space, such as LMS or CIE 1931 XYZ. If the reflectance spectrum of a color is 1 (100%) for all the wavelengths between A and B, and 0 for all the wavelengths of the other half of the color space, then that color is a maximum chroma color, semichrome, or full color (this is the explanation to why they were called semichromes). Thus, maximum chroma colors are a type of optimal color.

As explained, full colors are far from being monochromatic. If the spectral purity of a maximum chroma color is increased, its chroma decreases, because it will approach the visible spectrum, ergo, it will approach black.

In perceptually uniform color spaces, the lightness of the full colors varies from around 30% in the violetish blue hues, to around 90% in the yellowish hues. The chroma of each maximum chroma point also varies depending on the hue; in optimal color solids plotted in perceptually uniform color spaces, semichromes like red, green, blue, violet, and magenta have a high chroma, while semichromes like yellow, orange, and cyan have a slightly lower chroma. 

In color spheres and the HSL color space, the maximum chroma colors are located around the equator at the periphery of the color sphere. This makes color solids with a spherical shape inherently non-perceptually uniform, since they imply that all full colors have a lightness of 50%, when, as humans perceive them, there are full colors with a lightness from around 30% to around 90%. A perceptually uniform color solid has an irregular shape.

===== History of the idea of optimal colors =====
In the beginning of the 20th century, industrial demands for a controllable way to describe colors and the new possibility to measure light spectra initiated intense research on mathematical descriptions of colors.

The idea of optimal colors was introduced by the Baltic German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald. Erwin Schrödinger showed in his 1919 article &quot;&quot; (Theory of Pigments with Highest Luminosity) that the most-saturated colors that can be created with a given total reflectivity are generated by surfaces having either zero or full reflectance at any given wavelength, and the reflectivity spectrum must have at most two transitions between zero and full.

Schrödinger&#x27;s work was further developed by David MacAdam and . MacAdam was the first person to calculate precise coordinates of selected points on the boundary of the optimal color solid in the CIE 1931 color space for lightness levels from Y = 10 to 95 in steps of 10 units. This enabled him to draw the optimal color solid at an acceptable degree of precision. Because of his achievement, the boundary of the optimal color solid is called the &quot;MacAdam limit&quot; (1935).

On modern computers, it is possible to calculate an optimal color solid with great precision in seconds. Usually, only the MacAdam limits (the optimal colors, the boundary of the Optimal color solid) are computed, because all the other (non-optimal) possible surface colors exist inside the boundary.

====Light sources====
Light sources used as primaries in an additive color reproduction system need to be bright, so they are generally not close to monochromatic. That is, the color gamut of most variable-color light sources can be understood as a result of difficulties producing pure monochromatic (single wavelength) light. The best technological source of monochromatic light is the laser, which can be rather expensive and impractical for many systems. However, as optoelectronic technology matures, single-longitudinal-mode diode lasers are becoming less expensive, and many applications can already profit from this; such as Raman spectroscopy, holography, biomedical research, fluorescence, reprographics, interferometry, semiconductor inspection, remote detection, optical data storage, image recording, spectral analysis, printing, point-to-point free-space communications, and fiber optic communications.

Systems that use additive color processes usually have a color gamut which is roughly a convex polygon in the hue-chroma plane (not to be confused with the chromaticity diagram). The vertices of the polygon are the most chromatic colors that the system can produce.

====Substractive color mixing====
In subtractive color systems, the color gamut is more often an irregular, rounded region.

The gamut of a CMYK color space is, ideally, the same as that for an RGB one. In practice, due to the way raster-printed colors interact with each other and the paper and due to their non-ideal absorption spectra, the gamut has rounded corners.

===Comparison of various systems===

Following is a list of representative color systems more-or-less ordered from large to small color gamut:

* A laser video projector uses three lasers to produce the broadest gamut available in practical display equipment today, derived from the fact that lasers produce truly monochromatic primaries. The systems work either by scanning the entire picture a dot at a time and modulating the laser directly at high frequency, much like the electron beams in a cathode-ray tube (CRT), or by optically spreading and then modulating the laser and scanning a line at a time, the line itself being modulated in much the same way as in a DLP projector. Lasers can also be used as a light source for a DLP projector. More than three lasers can be combined to increase the gamut range, a technique sometimes used in holography.
* Digital Light Processing or DLP technology is a trademarked technology from Texas Instruments. The DLP chip contains a rectangular array of up to 2 million hinge-mounted microscopic mirrors. Each of the micromirrors measures less than one-fifth the width of a human hair. A DLP chip&#x27;s micromirror tilts either toward the light source in a DLP projection system (ON) or away from it (OFF). This creates a light or dark pixel on the projection surface. Current DLP projectors use a quickly rotating wheel with transparent colored &quot;pie slices&quot; to present each color frame successively. One rotation shows the complete image.
* Photographic film can reproduce a larger color gamut than typical television, computer, or home video systems.
* CRT and similar video displays have a roughly triangular color gamut which covers a significant portion of the visible color space. In CRTs, the limitations are due to the phosphors in the screen which produce red, green, and blue light.
* Liquid crystal display (LCD) screens filter the light emitted by a backlight. The gamut of an LCD screen is therefore limited to the emitted spectrum of the backlight. Typical LCD screens use cold-cathode fluorescent bulbs (CCFLs) for backlights. LCD Screens with certain LED or wide-gamut CCFL backlights yield a more comprehensive gamut than CRTs. However, some LCD technologies vary the color presented by viewing angle. In Plane Switching or Patterned vertical alignment screens have a wider span of colors than Twisted Nematic.
* Television normally uses a CRT, LCD, LED or plasma display, but does not take full advantage of its color display properties, due to the limitations of broadcasting. The common color profile for TV is based on ITU standard Rec. 601. HDTV is less restrictive and uses a slightly improved color profile based on ITU standard Rec. 709. Still somewhat less than, for example, computer displays using the same display technology. This is due to the use of a limited subset of RGB in broadcasting (values from 16-235), versus full RGB in computer displays, where all bits from 0 to 255 are used.
* Paint mixing, both artistic and for commercial applications, achieves a reasonably large color gamut by starting with a larger palette than the red, green, and blue of CRTs or cyan, magenta, and yellow of printing. Paint may reproduce some highly saturated colors that cannot be reproduced well by CRTs (particularly violet), but overall the color gamut is smaller.
* Printing typically uses the CMYK color space (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black). Very few printing processes do not include black; however, those processes (with the exception of dye-sublimation printers) are poor at representing low saturation, low intensity colors. Efforts have been made to expand the gamut of the printing process by adding inks of non-primary colors; these are typically orange and green (see Hexachrome) or light cyan and light magenta (see CcMmYK color model). Spot color inks of a very specific color are also sometimes used.
* A monochrome display&#x27;s color gamut is a one-dimensional curve in color space.

====Wide color gamut====
The Ultra HD Forum defines a wide color gamut (WCG) as a color gamut wider than that of BT.709 (Rec. 709). Color spaces with WCGs include:

* Rec. 2020 – ITU-R Recommendation for UHDTV
* Rec. 2100 – ITU-R Recommendation for HDR-TV (same chromaticity of color primaries and white point as Rec. 2020)
* DCI-P3
* Adobe RGB color space
* DxO Wide Gamut

====Extended-gamut printing====

The print gamut achieved by using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks is sometimes a limitation, for example when printing colors of corporate logos. Therefore, some methods of color printing use additional ink colors to achieve a larger gamut. For example, some use green, orange, and violet inks to increase the achievable saturation of hues near those. These method are variously called heptatone color printing, extended gamut printing, and 7-color printing, etc.

<doc id="429192" wikidata="Q1415722" url="?curid=429192" title="Lucky Town">
<text>Lucky Town is the tenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen. The album was released on March 27, 1992, the same day as Springsteen&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Human Touch&quot;. &quot;Lucky Town&quot; peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with lead single &quot;Better Days&quot; (double A-side single with &quot;Human Touch&quot;&#x27;s title track) peaking at number one on the US Mainstream Rock and number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. &quot;Lucky Town&quot; has since been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for over one million copies sold in the US.

==Background==
Springsteen was working on &quot;Human Touch&quot;, which he intended to release sometime in 1990, but the project took him longer than he thought. He shelved the project in early 1991 and came back to it in September of the same year. Intending to record one more song for the album (&quot;Living Proof&quot;), he ended up with 10 new songs. Once he completed the sessions, he decided to put the 10 new songs on a separate album, which became &quot;Lucky Town&quot;, and to release it at the same time as &quot;Human Touch&quot;. While most of the songs from the album have received few performances since the reunion of the E Street Band, &quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot; was played at every show during the 1999–2000 Reunion Tour and was included in the &quot;Live in New York City&quot; DVD and CD release.

==Themes==
Compared to &quot;Human Touch&quot;, &quot;Lucky Town&quot; has a more stripped down, folk-based sound and is more personal in its songs&#x27; lyrics. &quot;Human Touch&quot; consisted of mostly love songs, while &quot;Lucky Town&quot; focuses on more specific events in Springsteen&#x27;s life. The opening track &quot;Better Days&quot; expresses his desire to start over after some rough patches in his life (his divorce from his first wife). &quot;Living Proof&quot; is about the birth of his first son and &quot;Local Hero&quot; is about a time that he saw a picture of himself in a store window, which the salesgirl said was a picture of &quot;just a local hero&quot;. &quot;Souls of the Departed&quot; recalls &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; in its sound and social commentary. The song was inspired by the Gulf War.

==Critical reception==

Upon release the album received generally positive reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a positive review (a combined review with its companion album, &quot;Human Touch&quot;), but thought that the aims of the two albums &quot;would have been better realized by a single, more carefully shaped collection.&quot; In a mostly positive review, AllMusic said of the album: &quot;While &quot;Human Touch&quot; was a disappointing album of second-rate material, &quot;Lucky Town&quot; is an ambitious collection addressing many of Springsteen&#x27;s major concerns and moving them forward.&quot;

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it a &quot;ponderous, well-crafted disappointment, a shorter and by most accounts lighter piece of work than its more songful corelease &quot;Human Touch&quot;.&quot; Bill Wyman of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; compared it favorably to &quot;Human Touch&quot;, calling &quot;Lucky Town&quot; &quot;obviously the superior work&quot; and &quot;a much more interesting beast, primarily because of the potency of the first three numbers [which] could have made a respectable anchor to a strong album.&quot; However, he added that &quot;the record&#x27;s illegitimate beginnings soon take their toll, and formula returns to the fore...What themes there are on the record - a sort of Catholic wonder and love of life alternating with the usual fears and worries of the characters in Springsteen&#x27;s ongoing New Jersey gothic - never come alive.&quot; Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; later wrote that &quot;Lucky Town&quot; was &quot;highly underrated...containing some of the strongest songwriting of Springsteen&#x27;s career and ranks as one of his most completely realized albums.&quot;

In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for the year&#x27;s best albums, &quot;Lucky Town&quot; placed at number 17 in the voting, way ahead of &quot;Human Touch&quot; which finished at number 80.

<doc id="429195" wikidata="Q3267331" url="?curid=429195" title="USS Bullhead">
<text>USS &quot;Bullhead&quot; (SS-332), a , was the last US Navy ship sunk by enemy action during World War II, probably on the same day that an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. She was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bullhead (a name given to a number of large-headed bottom-dwelling fish, especially the catfish, miller&#x27;s thumb, and sculpin).

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Bullhead&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 16 July 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Grace Moody Doyle, wife of shipyard employee Howard R. Doyle who had won the privilege of naming the ship&#x27;s sponsor in a special election. Commander Walter T. Griffith, who had previously made three successful war patrols as commander of , was assigned as the new commanding officer for &quot;Bullhead&quot;. Griffith oversaw the submarines’ sea trials, and assembled &quot;Bullhead&quot;″s new crew around four experienced sailors who had followed him from &quot;Bowfin&quot;. &quot;Bullhead&quot; was commissioned 4 December 1944 and spent the next three months doing shakedown training around Narragansett Bay, Key West, and the Panama Canal Zone before heading to Pearl Harbor and then Guam.

== Operations ==
=== First patrol ===

Prior to &quot;Bullhead&quot; departing on her first patrol, Commander, Submarines, Pacific (COMSUBPAC) Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood met with Commander Griffith and introduced him to war correspondent and &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reporter Martin Sheridan. Sheridan had just finished covering B-29 firebombing raids over Tokyo, and requested permission to go on a submarine war patrol from the office of Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT) Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. His request was approved, and Sheridan was allowed to go on &quot;Bullhead&quot;″s first war patrol.

&quot;Bullhead&quot; departed Apra Harbor on 21 March 1945, bound for the South China Sea south of Formosa for lifeguard duty. With no airmen needing rescue, &quot;Bullhead&quot; received permission from COMSUBPAC to bombard the Japanese-occupied Pratas Island with deck guns on 31 March, and later on 24 April. On 8 April, &quot;Bullhead&quot; was nearly bombed by a U.S. Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator while travelling in a safety lane southwest of Macao, China, which caused Griffith to demand an investigation into reports of Fifth Air Force planes improperly patrolling submarine safe zones. On 16 April, &quot;Bullhead&quot; rescued three airmen from a downed B-25 Mitchell that had already been picked up by Chinese fishermen in Bias Bay near Hong Kong. The risky rescue mission was conducted only four miles from the Japanese-occupied Chinese coast and in 12 fathom (72 feet) deep water, which led to Griffith ordering the preemptive destruction of secret decoding equipment onboard prior to going in for the rescue. On 19 April, an aircraft — possibly another U.S. Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator, although Sheridan reported it as being a Japanese floatplane — dropped two depth charges on &quot;Bullhead&quot; as she submerged in the South China Sea. The depth charges detonated as &quot;Bullhead&quot; reached . She suffered no damage or casualties. &quot;Bullhead&quot; was ordered back to port on 25 April, but prior to leaving his patrol area, Griffith ordered that &quot;Bullhead&quot;″s extra provisions be distributed to local fishermen. &quot;Bullhead&quot; finished her first patrol at Subic Bay, Philippines on 28 April having only sunk four mines with gunfire.

Upon the return from the patrol, Admiral James Fife Jr. was very pleased with Sheridan&#x27;s reporting on submarine life and operations, and requested permission from Washington to send more war correspondents on submarine war patrols. However, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (COMINCH) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King sent the response: &quot;WAR CORRESPONDENTS MAY NOT REPEAT MAY NOT GO ON SUBMARINE WAR PATROLS.&quot; Thus, Martin Sheridan was the only war correspondent to go on a submarine war patrol in World War II.

=== Second patrol ===
Following a few weeks of refitting and training, &quot;Bullhead&quot; left for her second patrol on 21 May 1945, transiting the South China Sea on her way towards the Gulf of Siam and Java Sea. The first four weeks saw very little action, save for sinking a 150 ton lugger off the coast of Thailand on 30 May. On 19 June, &quot;Bullhead&quot; conducted an extensive surface gun action off St. Nicholas Point, Java where she sunk or damaged several small coastal freighters. On 24 June, &quot;Bullhead&quot; spent several hours stalking an 8,000-10,000 ton ship with red cross markings that was operating suspiciously, but Griffith was denied permission from headquarters to attack it with torpedoes. The next day, &quot;Bullhead&quot; rescued 10 Javanese conscripts from a Japanese coastal freighter that it had sunk. After a Dutch-speaking &quot;Bullhead&quot; crew member interrogated one of the survivors, they were released. &quot;Bullhead&quot; finished her second patrol at Fremantle submarine base on 2 July, claiming 1,850 tons across 2 large and 2 small vessels as sunk, as well as 1,300 tons and 3 vessels damaged, all in gun actions.

=== Third patrol and sinking ===

On 4 July 1945, Griffith was relieved by Lieutenant Commander Edward R. Holt, Jr. as commander of &quot;Bullhead&quot;. Holt, who had already served on 10 war patrols in junior officer positions, wrote to his wife that he hoped to &quot;live up to the wonderful job Comdr. Griffith had done.&quot; Griffith spent a few weeks planning &quot;Bullhead&quot;″s third patrol with Holt before departing for Guam to become Assistant Operations Officer to Vice Admiral Lockwood. During this time, &quot;Bullhead&quot; was refitted with a second 5-inch deck gun on her forward deck, as well as a second 40 mm Bofors autocannon to replace the Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon on the forward bridge.

On 31 July 1945 &quot;Bullhead&quot; left Fremantle to commence her third war patrol. Her orders were to patrol in a &quot;wolfpack&quot; with and in the Java Sea until 5 September and then head for Subic Bay in the Philippines. On 4 August, &quot;Bullhead&quot; met the Dutch submarine HNLMS O 21 350 miles south of the Lombok Strait and transferred a sack of mail intended for the United States. This was the last confirmed sighting of &quot;Bullhead&quot;.

&quot;Bullhead&quot; reported on 6 August that she had passed through Lombok Strait. That was the last word received from &quot;Bullhead&quot;. On 12 August, &quot;Capitaine&quot;, planning to arrive on 13 August, ordered &quot;Bullhead&quot; to take position the following day in a scouting line with &quot;Capitaine&quot; and &quot;Puffer&quot;. Receiving no reply, &quot;Capitaine&quot; reported on 15 August, &quot;Have been unable to contact &quot;Bullhead&quot; by any means since arriving in area.&quot;

Since the British submarines and were in the same general area as &quot;Bullhead&quot;, and and passed through in transit at various times, it is difficult to determine precisely which of the many Japanese anti-submarine attacks was the one that sank &quot;Bullhead&quot;. However, one occurred on 6 August 1945, when a Mitsubishi Ki-51 from the 73rd Independent Chutai (literally &quot;company&quot; or squadron) of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force attacked with depth charges. It claimed two direct hits, and for ten minutes thereafter, there was a great amount of gushing oil and air bubbles rising in the water. Since the position given is very near the Balinese coast, it is presumed that the proximity of mountain peaks shortened &quot;Bullhead&quot;″s radar range and prevented her from receiving a warning of the plane&#x27;s approach. 84 men were lost while serving on &quot;Bullhead&quot; during the sinking.

== Honors and awards ==
&quot;Bullhead&quot; received two battle stars for her World War II service.

==Commemoration==
In August 2022, on the 76th anniversary of the submarine&#x27;s sinking, a new memorial for USS &quot;Bullhead&quot; was unveiled at the Western Australian Maritime Museum, Fremantle, Western Australia in the presence of the U.S. Consul General David Gainer.

<text>The Texas Legislature is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Texas. It is a bicameral body composed of a 31-member Senate and a 150-member House of Representatives. The state legislature meets at the Capitol in Austin. It is a powerful arm of the Texas government not only because of its power of the purse to control and direct the activities of state government and the strong constitutional connections between it and the lieutenant governor of Texas, but also due to Texas&#x27;s plural executive.

The Legislature is the constitutional successor of the Congress of the Republic of Texas since Texas&#x27;s 1845 entrance into the Union. The Legislature held its first regular session from February 16 to May 13, 1846.

==Structure and operations==
The Texas Legislature meets in regular session on the second Tuesday in January of each odd-numbered year, one of only four states (and by far the largest) not to hold annual sessions. The Texas Constitution limits the regular session to 140 calendar days. The lieutenant governor, elected statewide separately from the governor, presides over the Senate, while the Speaker of the House is elected from that body by its members. Both have wide latitude in choosing committee membership in their respective houses and have a large impact on lawmaking in the state.

Only the governor may call the Legislature into special sessions, unlike other states where the legislature may call itself into session. The governor may call as many sessions as desired. For example, Governor Rick Perry called three consecutive sessions to address the 2003 Texas congressional redistricting. The Texas Constitution limits the duration of each special session to 30 days; lawmakers may consider only those issues designated by the governor in his &quot;call,&quot; or proclamation convening the special session (though other issues may be added by the Governor during a session).

Any bill passed by the Legislature takes effect 90 days after its passage unless two-thirds of each house votes to give the bill either immediate effect or earlier effect. The Legislature may provide for an effective date that is after the 90th day. Under current legislative practice, most bills are given an effective date of September 1 in odd-numbered years (September 1 is the start of the state&#x27;s fiscal year). Bills can (and many are) pre-filed before the start of a session: for regular sessions the lower numbers are reserved for bills with high priority by Legislative leadership (with HB1 and SB1 specifically reserved for each chamber&#x27;s version of the General Appropriations Act, the state&#x27;s budget and spending authority).

Although members are elected on partisan ballots, both houses of the Legislature are officially organized on a nonpartisan basis, with members of both parties serving in leadership positions such as committee chairmanships. As of 2022, a majority of the members of each chamber are members of the Republican Party.

==Qualifications for service==
The Texas Constitution sets the qualifications for election to each house as follows:

*A senator must be at least 26 years of age, a resident of Texas for five years prior to election and a resident of the district from which elected one year prior to election. Each senator serves a four-year term and one-half of the Senate membership is elected every two years in even-numbered years, with the exception that &quot;all&quot; the Senate seats are up for election for the first legislature following the decennial census in order to reflect the newly redrawn districts (this takes place in years ending in &quot;2&quot;). After the initial election, the Senate is divided by lot into two classes, with one class having a re-election after two years and the other having a re-election after four years.
*A representative must be at least 21 years of age, a citizen of Texas for two years prior to election and a resident of the district from which elected one year prior to election. They are elected for two-year terms, running for re-election in even-numbered years.
*Neither may, for the time they were originally elected, hold any civil office under the State that was created during that term, nor for any such office whose compensation was increased during such time. Furthermore, judges (and their clerks) and any person holding a &quot;lucrative office&quot; under the United States, this State or a foreign government, cannot, while remaining in those offices, be a member of the Legislature; tax collectors and those entrusted with public money must receive a discharge for those funds before they are eligible to the Legislature.

== Salary of legislative officials ==
State legislators in Texas make $600 per month, or $7,200 per year, plus a per diem of $221 for every day the Legislature is in session (also including any special sessions). That adds up to $38,140 a year for a regular session (140 days), with the total pay for a two-year term being $45,340. Legislators receive a pension after eight years of service, starting at age 60.

==Makeup==

===Senate===

===House of Representatives===

====2021 House quorum bust====
Article III, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution requires that 2/3 of a chamber&#x27;s members be present to constitute a quorum for conducting business (this is greater than what is required for the United States Congress, which only requires a simple majority of a chamber&#x27;s members). This has resulted in several instances where, in an effort to block legislation from passing, a sufficient number of members have fled the state in order to deny a quorum.

The most recent of these attempts took place during a 2021 special session of the Legislature. On July 12, 2021, during a special session, at least 51 Democratic members of the House fled the state in two charter jets bound for Washington, D.C., in an effort to block Republican-backed election legislation from passing. The lawmakers planned to spend at least three weeks in Washington, running out the clock on the special session, which began July 8. During their time away from the state legislative chambers, they also advocated for federal voting legislation such as the For the People Act.

Governor Abbott stated that representatives, upon return to the state, would be arrested and escorted to the state legislative chambers to fulfill their lawmaking duties. He additionally noted he would use his power to call successive special sessions until such a time as the legislature met quorum to vote on the bill. After the first special session expired on August 6, Governor Abbott called a second session the next day. State District Judge Brad Urrutia granted a restraining order on August 9 temporarily protecting the absent Democrats from arrest by the state, however this restraining order was overturned by the Texas Supreme Court. On August 10, with the chamber still lacking a quorum, Speaker Dade Phelan issued arrest warrants for the 52 absent Democratic members of the House. The bill passed upon the eventual return of enough state Democrats to constitute a quorum in the legislature.

==Support agencies==
The Texas Legislature has five support agencies that are within the legislative branch of state government.

Those five agencies are as follows:
* Texas Legislative Budget Board
* Texas Legislative Council
* Texas Legislative Reference Library
* Texas State Auditor
* Texas Sunset Advisory Commission

== Scandals ==
* On May 14, 2007, CBS Austin affiliate KEYE reported on the rampant multiple voting by members of the Texas House of Representatives during a voting session. The report noted how representatives would race to the nearest empty seats to register votes for absent members on the legislature&#x27;s automated voting machines. Each representative would vote for the nearest absent members, apparently regardless of party affiliation. This practice was in direct violation of a Rule of the Texas Legislature; however, no house member had ever been disciplined for the practice. The then-Speaker of the House Tom Craddick, responsible for enforcement of the rule, issued a statement that discipline for violations of the rule is left to the individual house members. Subsequent similar violations under House Speaker Joe Straus were unenforced. Current House rules allow any member to demand &quot;strict enforcement&quot; on any record vote; this requires members to vote from their desks (only the proponent of a bill can vote from the front microphone in front of the dais) and only for themselves.
* On April 10, 2023, a complaint against Republican Rep. Bryan Slaton was made public, alleging that Slaton had an &quot;inappropriate relationship&quot; with an intern. The Texas House General Investigating Committee investigated the alleged incident, and found that Slaton had provided alcohol to a 19-year old legislative aide before the two had sexual relations at Slaton&#x27;s apartment in Austin. The committee, composed of three Republicans and two Democrats, unanimously recommended Slaton&#x27;s expulsion from the House. Slaton resigned from the House on May 8, 2023, but unless expelled he would have been entitled to his salary and per diem under Texas law until a successor was elected. On May 9, 2023, the House expelled Slaton by a vote of 147–0.

<doc id="429199" wikidata="Q4768368" url="?curid=429199" title="Anne Garrels">
<text>Anne Longworth Garrels (July 2, 1951 – September 7, 2022) was an American broadcast journalist who worked as a foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, as well as for ABC and NBC, and other media.

In the mid-1970s, when she worked for ABC (including as producer), Garrels was one of the few women national broadcast journalists in the United States—eventually serving as ABC&#x27;s Moscow Bureau Chief in the Soviet Union, until expelled for her detailed, unflattering reporting on the country and its issues. She became a war correspondent for ABC, covering Central American conflicts. She later became NBC&#x27;s reporter at the U.S. State Department.

In 1988, Garrels began her 22-year career as a foreign correspondent for National Public Radio (NPR), closely covering conflicts and other major events throughout the world, earning numerous media awards, most famously for covering the 2003 Iraq War and its aftermath—at one point the only American broadcast journalist in Iraq&#x27;s war-torn capital.

Garrels was active in journalism-related organizations, and global affairs causes, and wrote two noted books—one about the Soviet Union, and one about the Iraq war and its aftermath, both recounting her own experiences, as well as providing detailed historical coverage of those places in that time.

==Background and education==
Anne Longworth Garrels was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on July 2, 1951, the daughter of Valerie (Smith) and John C. Garrels Jr. She spent part of her childhood in London, where her father worked as an executive for Monsanto. She was educated at St Catherine&#x27;s School, Bramley.

Garrels returned to the United States and enrolled at Middlebury College, but later transferred to Harvard University&#x27;s Radcliffe College, where she studied Russian and graduated in 1972.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1975, Garrels worked for the ABC television network in several positions for ten years, including as producerone of the few women broadcast journalists at the time.

She served ABC in the Soviet Union as Moscow bureau chief and correspondent until she was expelled in 1982. Able to speak Russian, and &quot;in love&quot; with the country, she was noted for more in-depth reporting from that country than most other U.S. journalists. She interviewed prominent Soviet dissidents Andrei Sakharov, Roy Medvedev, and Sergei Kovalyov. Her reporting exposed numerous hardships of Soviet citizens, displeasing the Soviet government, resulting in her 1982 expulsion. She did not return until 1988, just before the collapse of the Soviet Union.

As ABC&#x27;s Central American bureau chief from 1984 to 1985, she covered the wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador.

From 1985 to 1988, Garrels reported for NBC News as its correspondent at the U.S. State Department.

In mid-1988, Garrels hosted &quot;Science Journal,&quot; a 25-part weekly news series on science, medicine and technology, at WETA-TV, and aired by PBS. It was the first such television series of its kind, with panel discussions among experts and journalists. However, Garrels&#x27; workload at National Public Radio (particularly as State Department correspondent), and a family illness, forced her to withdraw from the program that November.

===NPR career===
Garrels joined NPR in 1988 and reported on conflicts in Chechnya, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, the West Bank, and Iraq. She also reported from China (and covered the Tiananmen Square Protests) and Saudi Arabia. She returned to Russia in 1988, as the Soviet Union began to collapse, and from 1993 until 1997 was NPR&#x27;s Moscow bureau chief.

Garrels was the Edward R. Murrow Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in 1996, and was a member of the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists from 1999 until her death in 2022. She also served on the board of Oxfam America.

Following the 9/11 attacks on the U.S., in September 2001, and during the subsequent U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, Garrels spent several months in northern Afghanistan with the Northern Alliance, and in or around Kabul, also traveling to Pakistan and Israel in early 2002.

Shortly before the U.S. and its coalition invaded Iraq in 2003, Garrels traveled there. and was one of the sixteen Western journalists who remained in Baghdad, and reported live during the 2003 Iraq War—and for a while was the only American broadcast reporter still broadcasting from the middle of Baghdad. Garrels survived the April 8, 2003, U.S. tank attack on the Palestine Hotel, where she and hundreds of other journalists were living.

Following the April 8, 2003, U.S. bombing of the Al Jazeera office in Baghdad, which killed journalist Tareq Ayyoub (&quot;Tariq/Tareq Ayoub&quot;), Garrels reportedly said that Ayyoub should have known better than to be in his office during the invasion—a comment that raised angry responses from some in the international journalism community, who accused her of &quot;blaming the victim.&quot;

Shortly after her return from Iraq, she published &quot;Naked in Baghdad&quot; (2003, Farrar, Straus, and Giroux), a memoir of her time covering the events surrounding the invasion. She subsequently returned to Iraq several times for NPR. She was an embedded reporter with the U.S. Marines during the November 2004 attack on Fallujah. Garrels also covered the January 2005 Iraqi national elections for an interim government, as well as constitutional referendum and the December 2005 elections for the first full term Iraqi government. As sectarian violence swept much of central Iraq Garrels continued to report from Baghdad, Najaf and Basra.

In 2007 Garrels was criticized by FAIR for using confessions by prisoners who had been tortured, during a story about an Iraqi Shiite militia (broadcast on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot;). Garrels later defended her story on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Letters&quot; program, saying: &quot;Of course, I had doubts. But the details that were given seemed to me to gel with other things that I had heard from people who had not been tortured. But I was as uncomfortable as the listeners were with the conditions.&quot;

Garrels retired from NPR in 2010.

===Late career===
Garrels continued her work with the Committee to Protect Journalists until the end of her life, serving on its board of directors.

In 2016, she published her second book, &quot;Putin Country: A Journey into the Real Russia,&quot; with Farrar, Straus, and Giroux.

Toward the end of her life, Garrels served as a judge for the Overseas Press Club Awards, including the Lowell Thomas Award which she judged in 2021.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Garrels, then 70 years old and undergoing treatment for cancer, approached NPR about coming out of retirement to cover the conflict. While her offer was declined, she started a non-profit organization, Assist-Ukraine, to raise money to support Ukraine and victims of the war, particularly medical supplies, reportedly raising US$1 million for the cause.

==Personal life==
In 1986, Garrels married J. Vinton Lawrence, one of two CIA paramilitary officers from the Special Activities Division stationed in Laos in the early 1960s, who worked with Hmong tribesmen and the CIA-owned airline Air America. They were married until Lawrence&#x27;s death from leukemia in 2016.

Garrels lived in Norfolk, Connecticut, where she died from lung cancer on September 7, 2022, aged 71.

<text>Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me! is an hour-long weekly news radio panel show produced by WBEZ and National Public Radio (NPR) in Chicago, Illinois. On the program, panelists and contestants are quizzed in humorous ways about that week&#x27;s news. It is distributed by NPR in the United States, internationally on NPR Worldwide and on the Internet via podcast, and typically broadcast on weekends by member stations. The show averages about six million weekly listeners on air and via podcast.

==Format==

&quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; premiered in 1996 and was recorded in front of a live audience in the Chase Auditorium beneath Chicago&#x27;s Chase Tower on Thursday nights. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, episodes were recorded remotely beginning March 2020, largely from panelists&#x27; homes, with sound effects added for broadcast. Live audience recordings resumed in August 2021. In June 2022, the show moved to the Studebaker Theater in Chicago&#x27;s Fine Arts Building. Episodes are periodically recorded on tour in venues across the United States.

The show is hosted by playwright and actor Peter Sagal. When the program had its debut in January 1998, Dan Coffey of &quot;Ask Dr. Science&quot; was the original host, but a revamping of the show led to his replacement in May of that year. The show has also been guest-hosted by Tom Bodett, Luke Burbank, Adam Felber, Peter Grosz, Tom Papa, Mike Pesca, Richard Sher, Bill Radke, Susan Stamberg, Robert Siegel, Brian Unger, Drew Carey, Tom Hanks, Helen Hong, Jessi Klein, Maz Jobrani, Negin Farsad, Alzo Slade, Josh Gondelman, Karen Chee. and Dulcé Sloan.

The announcer, also serving as judge and scorekeeper, has been Bill Kurtis since 2014, though Chioke I&#x27;Anson, Lakshmi Singh, Andy Richter Helen Hong, Ayesha Rascoe, Joshua Johnson and Tim Meadows have substituted. Carl Kasell preceded Kurtis, who often filled in for him.

&quot;Wait Wait...&quot; listeners also participate by telephoning or sending emails to nominate themselves as contestants, or as of January 9, 2024, followers of the show&#x27;s official Instagram account can click a link in the bio which will take them to a form to fill out and register to be a contestant. The producers select several listeners for each show and call them to appear on the program, playing various games featuring questions based on the week&#x27;s news. Prior to October 21, 2017, the usual prize for winning any game was to have Kasell (named &quot;Scorekeeper Emeritus&quot; following his retirement) record a greeting on the contestant&#x27;s home answering machine or voice mail system; after Kasell&#x27;s death in 2018, the prize was changed to have a host or panelist of the contestant&#x27;s choice record a greeting.

==On-air segments==

Though there are some deviations from time to time, episodes of &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; feature the following format:

===Opening tease===
As with other NPR programs, &quot;Wait Wait&quot; offers a one-minute top-of-hour billboard teasing the program that will follow the network&#x27;s hourly newscast (which traditionally starts at one minute past the hour). In this minute, the host offers a humorous comment on the week&#x27;s news, mentions the identity of the week&#x27;s interview guest, and sets up an out-of-context reading by the announcer of a quote or game title from the episode.

===Who&#x27;s Bill This Time?===
The contestant is asked to identify the speaker or explain the context of three quotations from that week&#x27;s major news stories as read by the announcer (usually Bill Kurtis). Each answer is followed by a humorous discussion of the story by the host and the panelists. Two correct answers constitute a win for the contestant. Prior to Kasell&#x27;s retirement, the segment was known as &quot;Who&#x27;s Carl This Time?&quot; and he read the quotations. Whenever Kurtis is absent, his first name is replaced by that of the person filling in for him in the game&#x27;s name.

===Panel questions===
In two separate segments each week, the host asks the panelists questions regarding less serious stories in the week&#x27;s news, awarding them one point for each correct answer. The questions are phrased similarly to those featured on &quot;The Match Game&quot; or &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; to allow the panelists to offer a comedic answer in addition to their real guess as well as a hint from the host if needed. The answer is often followed by a discussion of the story.

===Bluff the Listener===
Each panelist reads an unusual story, all sharing a common theme. Only one of the three stories is genuine; the contestant wins the prize by choosing it. A sound bite from a person connected to the genuine story is played to reveal whether the contestant&#x27;s guess is correct. Regardless of the outcome, the panelist whose story is chosen scores one point.

===Not My Job===

A celebrity guest calls in (or occasionally appears onstage) to be interviewed by the host and the panelists as well as take a three-question multiple-choice quiz. In &quot;Wait Wait&quot;″s early years, &quot;Not My Job&quot; guests were mainly pulled from NPR&#x27;s roster of personalities and reporters; the pool of guests later expanded to include guests of greater celebrity. As the segment&#x27;s title suggests, the guests are quizzed on topics that are not normally associated with their field of work. For example, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked questions on the history of Hugh Hefner and &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, while author Salman Rushdie was asked about the history of Pez candy. Often, the subject matter of the quizzes serve as an oblique yet comic juxtaposition to the guests&#x27; fields of work, such as when &quot;Mad Men&quot; creator/producer Matthew Weiner was quizzed on ways people try to cheer others up (&quot;Glad Men&quot;) in a March 2015 appearance.

===Listener Limerick Challenge===
Kurtis (or the announcer) reads three limericks connected to unusual news stories, leaving out the last word or phrase of each. The contestant wins the prize by correctly completing any two of them. The limericks are written by Philipp Goedicke.

=== Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank ===
In the Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank, each panelist has to answer as many questions as they can in 60 seconds with each correct answer earning the panelist 2 points. At the end there is a question whose answer gets an expanded clarification by Peter or whomever is guest hosting; this question usually deals with an especially odd or obscure news story from the week.

==Television==
In 2008, National Public Radio reached an agreement with CBS Entertainment to create a television pilot of &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; Peter Sagal and Carl Kasell would be in the pilot, and Doug Berman would be the executive producer.

On November 16, 2011, BBC America announced that the show would make its television debut with a &quot;2011 Year in Review&quot; special airing on December 23, to be retransmitted by NPR stations on the 24th and 25th. The taping included two American panelists—&quot;Wait Wait&quot; regulars Paula Poundstone and Alonzo Bodden—and British newcomer Nick Hancock. In December 2018, NBCUniversal announced it was developing a television version of &quot;Wait Wait… Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;

==Live cinema==
On May 2, 2013, an episode was performed at the NYU Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York City and was streamed live via satellite as a Fathom Events presentation to hundreds of cinema theaters throughout the United States and Canada. The show included host Peter Sagal, announcer Carl Kasell, and panelists Mo Rocca, Paula Poundstone, and Tom Bodett. Celebrity guest Steve Martin won in the &quot;Not My Job&quot; segment.

==Awards==
In April 2008, &quot;Wait Wait&quot; won a Peabody Award. The program website was nominated for a Webby Award for Humor in 2008.

<doc id="429211" wikidata="Q731665" url="?curid=429211" title="Fiddler's Green">
<text>Fiddler&#x27;s Green is an after-life where there is perpetual , a fiddle that never stops playing, and dancers who never tire.
In 19th-century English maritime folklore, it was a kind of after-life for sailors who had served at least fifty years at sea.

==In literature==
Not all early mentions of Fiddler&#x27;s Green are positive. For example, Edward Rose&#x27;s &quot;The Sea-Devil, or, Son of a Bellows-Mender&quot; (1811) has the following dialogue:
and a description published in a number of magazines around 1825:
More positively, Fiddler&#x27;s Green is mentioned in Frederick Marryat&#x27;s novel &quot;Snarleyyow; or, The Dog Fiend&quot; (1837), in a sailors&#x27; song with the chorus:

Herman Melville describes a Fiddler&#x27;s Green as a sailors&#x27; term for the place on land &quot;providentially set apart for dance-houses, doxies, and tapsters&quot; in his posthumous novella &quot;Billy Budd, Sailor&quot;.

In Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s novel &quot;Post Captain&quot; (1972), the character Jack Aubrey describes several seamen living together on land by saying, &quot;We&#x27;ll lay in beer and skittles – it will be Fiddler&#x27;s Green!&quot;.

In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; comic book series, Fiddler&#x27;s Green is a place located inside of the Dreaming, a place that sailors have dreamed of for centuries. Fiddler&#x27;s Green is also personified as a character as well as a location in the fictional world, the former largely based upon casual associations of G. K. Chesterton. In the 2022 TV adaption of the books, the personification is played by Stephen Fry. From November 12 to 14, 2004, a comic book convention promoted as &quot;Fiddler&#x27;s Green, A Sandman Convention&quot; was held at the Millennium Hotel in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Author Neil Gaiman and several &quot;Sandman&quot; series artists, and others involved in the series&#x27; publication, participated in the convention, with profits benefiting the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund. 

Fiddler&#x27;s Green is an extrasolar colony mentioned in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s novels &quot;Friday&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; (1985).

===Title names===
&quot;Fiddler&#x27;s Green&quot; is the title of a 1950 novel by Ernest K. Gann, about a fugitive criminal who works as a seaman after stowing away. The author Richard McKenna wrote a story, first published in 1967, titled &quot;Fiddler&#x27;s Green,” in which he considers the power of the mind to create a reality of its own choosing, especially when a number of people consent to it. The main characters in this story are also sailors, and have known of the legend of Fiddler&#x27;s Green for many years. It is also the title of the last book of Richard Woodman&#x27;s history of the British Merchant Navy.

==In music==
* A song called &quot;Fiddler&#x27;s Green&quot;, or more often &quot;Fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle Song&quot;, was written by John Conolly in 1966, a Lincolnshire songwriter.

* In George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Land of the Dead&quot;, the human holdout, surrounded by water, is a former luxury development called Fiddler&#x27;s Green.

==In the United States military==
The Cavalrymen&#x27;s Poem, also entitled &quot;Fiddlers&#x27; Green&quot; was published in the US Army&#x27;s &quot;Cavalry Journal&quot; in 1923 and became associated with the 1st Cavalry Division.

&lt;poem&gt;Halfway down the trail to Hell in a shady meadow green,
are the Souls of all dead troopers camped near a good old-time canteen,
and this eternal resting place is known as Fiddlers&#x27; Green.

Marching past, straight through to Hell, the Infantry are seen, 
accompanied by the Engineers, Artillery and Marine,
for none but the shades of Cavalrymen dismount at Fiddlers&#x27; Green.

Though some go curving down the trail to seek a warmer scene,
no trooper ever gets to Hell ere he&#x27;s emptied his canteen 
and so rides back to drink again with friends at Fiddlers&#x27; Green.
And so when man and horse go down beneath a saber keen,
or in a roaring charge fierce melee you stop a bullet clean,
and the hostiles come to get your scalp,
just empty your canteen and put your pistol to your head
and go to Fiddlers&#x27; Green.&lt;/poem&gt;

The name has had other military uses. Many places associated with the US military have been named Fiddler&#x27;s Green:

<doc id="429216" wikidata="Q52080" url="?curid=429216" title="Cortona">
<text>Cortona (, ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Arezzo, in Tuscany, Italy. It is the main cultural and artistic centre of the Val di Chiana after Arezzo.

==Toponymy==

Cortona is derived from Latin Cortōna, and from Etruscan 𐌂𐌖𐌓𐌕𐌖𐌍 (&quot;curtun&quot;, 𐌍𐌖𐌕𐌓𐌖𐌂 in Etruscan). According to linguist Helmut Rix, ethnic in Etruscan was &quot;curthute&quot; (&quot;curѳute&quot;), attested as a gentile in an inscription from Chiusi, in the province of Siena.

==History==

===Etruscan period===

An Etruscan presence is found archaeologically from the late Villanovan while there is no such evidence of an Umbrian origin of the city. Between the 8th and 7th centuries BC it became an important member of the Etruscan League or a &quot;lucumonia&quot;. Most likely, Cortona became a very powerful city thanks to its strategic position, which allowed a wide control of nearby territory.

In the 4th century BC the Etruscans built the imposing walls that surround the city for about 3 km, the &quot;melon&quot; tombs scattered around the city and the monumental funerary altar (Tumulus II of the Sodo) adorned with sphinxes, a unique example in Italy. The Tabula Cortonensis was also found here, a bronze sheet with one of the longest inscriptions in the Etruscan language.

In 310 BC many Etruscan cities were subdued by Rome and Cortona made an alliance with Rome which however was not respected and led to a violent clash near Lake Trasimeno.

===Roman period===

Cortona eventually became a Roman colony under the name &quot;Corito&quot;. Cortona lost much of its influence under Roman rule. The Via Cassia, the main Roman artery through central Etruria, led directly from Chiusi to Arezzo, bypassing Cortona.

During the Second Punic War Hannibal besieged and attacked Cortona. The famous battle of Trasimeno took place not far away and the hamlet of Ossaia, not far from the battlefield, takes its name because the remains of the dead were amassed there, becoming an ossuary.

Traces from the Roman period can also be found in the names of some local hamlets, in particular Metelliano, derived from the toponym of the patrician family Metelli, and Centoia on an ancient checkpoint near the via Cassia, seat of a Century, sub-unit of the Roman army.

In 450 AD the Goths occupied Cortona. In the final stages of the Gothic War (535–554), Cortona was sacked and destroyed.

===Later History===

Cortona became a Ghibellinian city state in the 13th century, with its own currency. From 1325 to 1409, the Ranieri-Casali family successfully ruled the town. After being conquered by Ladislaus of Naples in 1409, Cortona was sold to the Medici in 1411. In 1737, the senior branch of the Medici line became extinct and Cortona came under the authority of the House of Lorraine. Following the Italian Wars of Independence, Tuscany—Cortona included—became part of the Kingdom of Italy.

===Cortona foundation myth===
The foundation of Cortona remains mixed in myths dating to classic times. These were later reworked especially in the late Renaissance period under Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici. The 17th-century Guide of Giacomo Lauro, reworked from writings of Annio da Viterbo, states that 108 years after the Great Flood, Noah entered the Valdichiana via the Tiber and Paglia rivers. He preferred this place to anywhere else in Italy, because it was so fertile, and dwelt there for thirty years. One of Noah&#x27;s descendants was Crano, his son who came to the hilltop and, liking the high position, the fine countryside and the calm air, built the city of Cortona on it in 273 years after the Great Flood.

== Main sights ==


The prevailing character of Cortona&#x27;s architecture is medieval with steep narrow streets situated on a hillside at an elevation of that embraces a view of the whole of the Valdichiana. From the Piazza Garibaldi (still referred to by the local population by its older name, Piazza Carbonaia) is a fine prospect of Lake Trasimeno, scene of Hannibal&#x27;s ambush of the Roman army in 217 BC (Battle of Lake Trasimene). 

Cortona Archaeological Park hosts interesting remains from the Etruscan city state, including ancient walls, buildings and ceremonial tombs. boasts a number of interesting remains from its past as an Etruscan city state. The surrounding countryside is dotted with sections of ancient walls, buildings and ceremonial tombs. Parts of the Etruscan city wall can still be seen today as the basis of the present wall. The main street, via Nazionale, is the only street in the town with no gradient, and is still usually referred to by locals by its older name of Ruga Piana. Outside Cortona are the Roman villa at Ossaia and the Roman roads in the hills nearby which can still be traveled today.

The &quot;Palazzo Casali&quot;, also known as &quot;Palazzo Pretorio&quot;, houses the &quot;Museo dell&#x27;Accademia Etrusca&quot;, displaying items from Etruscan, Roman, and Egyptian civilizations, as well as art and artefacts from the Medieval and Renaissance eras. The distinguished Etruscan Academy Museum had its foundation in 1727 with the collections and library of Onofrio Baldelli. Among its most famous ancient artefacts is the bronze &quot;lampadario&quot; or Etruscan hanging lamp, found at Fratta near Cortona in 1840 and then acquired by the Academy for the large sum of 1600 Florentine scudi. Its iconography includes (under the 16 burners) alternating figures of Silenus playing panpipes or double flutes, and of sirens or harpies. Within zones representing waves, dolphins and fiercer sea-creatures is a gorgon-like face with protruding tongue. Between each burner is a modelled horned head of Achelous. It is supposed that the lampadario derived from some important north Etruscan religious shrine of around the second half of the 4th century BC. A later (2nd century BC) inscription shows it was rededicated for votive purposes (tinscvil) by the &quot;Musni&quot; family at that time. The Museum contains several other important Etruscan bronzes.

Etruscan chamber-tombs nearby include the &quot;Tanella di Pitagora&quot; (halfway up the hill from Camucia): the fine masonry of the tomb stands exposed, but was formerly covered by an earth mound. Two at the foot of the hillside at Il Sodo, and a complex in Camucia itself. Il Sodo I, the &#x27;Grotta Sergardi&#x27; commonly known as &#x27;Il Melone&#x27;, contains a passage, opening into parallel passages leading to square inner chambers, within a mound about in circumference. Although the chambers are paved with slabs of masonry the walls are constructed of pieces of rock roughly-formed into bricks. This tomb can be visited. Il Sodo II contained a large stone-stepped altar platform with carved sphinxes devouring warriors.

The town&#x27;s chief artistic treasures are two panels by Fra Angelico in the Diocesan Museum, an &quot;Annunciation&quot; and a &quot;Madonna and Child with Saints&quot;. A third surviving work by the same artist is the fresco above the entrance to the church of &quot;San Domenico&quot;, likewise painted during his stay at Cortona in 1436. The Diocesan Museum houses also a group of work by Giuseppe Maria Crespi, known as Lo Spagnuolo, called &quot;Ecstasy of Saint Margaret&quot;. The Academy Museum includes the very well known painting &quot;Maternità&quot; of 1916 by the Cortonese artist Gino Severini. There are also examples of the works of Pietro da Cortona.

The villa &quot;Bramasole&quot;, built in 1504, was used as the location for the 2003 film &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot;.

===The Imperial villa of Ossaia===
The Imperial villa was inhabited from the 1st century BC until the 6th century AD. The large, luxurious, elongated terraced villa was owned first by the consular family Vibii Pansae, followed by Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar, grandsons and heirs to the throne of emperor Augustus.

===Other archaeological areas===


The archaeological park of Cortona has 11 sites, among which is the second tumulus of the Sodo, an imposing 6th century BC tomb with a monumental staircase decorated by large sculptural groups.

=== Renaissance architecture ===


&quot;Santa Maria Nuova&quot;, built by Giorgio Vasari in 1554, is a domed church with a centralized Greek cross layout. Inside are four large columns which supports the lantern of the cupola. At the sides the four arms of the cross branch out covered with barrel-vaults, while four small cupolas arise in the spaces of the angles. The interior contains paintings depicting a &quot;Nativity&quot; by Alessandro Allori, &quot;San Carlo Borromeo administers communion to those afflicted by Plague&quot; by Baccio Ciarpi, and an &quot;Annunciation&quot; by Empoli. The church is in poor condition, and the interior is not open for visitors.

&quot;Santa Maria delle Grazie al Calcinaio&quot; was built in 1484–1515 by Francesco di Giorgio Martini to shelter a putatively miraculous icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the &quot;Madonna del Calcinaio&quot;. This image was originally painted on the timbers of a lime-vat, a &quot;calcinaio&quot;, hence the name. A centralized Renaissance design was applied to the design of the nave: the eastern part of the building was generally developed into a centralized form, which would then be crowned with a large cupola, foreshadowing the cathedral at Florence. The restored interior has unusually high arches.

<text>Carnaby Street is a pedestrianised shopping street in Soho in the City of Westminster, Central London. Close to Oxford Street and Regent Street, it is home to fashion and lifestyle retailers, including many independent fashion boutiques.

Streets crossing, or meeting with, Carnaby Street are, from south to north, Beak Street, Broadwick Street, Kingly Court, Ganton Street, Marlborough Court, Lowndes Court, Fouberts Place, Little Marlborough Street and Great Marlborough Street. The nearest London Underground station is Oxford Circus.

==History==

Carnaby Street derives its name from Karnaby House, which was built in 1683 to the east. The origin of the name is unknown. The street was probably laid out in 1685 or 1686. First appearing in the ratebooks in 1687, it was almost completely built up by 1690 with small houses. A market was developed in the 1820s. In his novel, &quot;Sybil&quot; (1845), Benjamin Disraeli refers to &quot;a carcase-butcher famous in Carnaby-market&quot;.

This area is notable for a cholera outbreak in 1854 that led to an early application of fundamental epidemiological principles to resolve the crisis. John Snow, the physician who recognised the cases were concentrated near a pump on Broad Street (later renamed Broadwick Street), communicated the finding on a topographical display. This led to the pump being locked, after which the reduction in cases of cholera was rapid.

===20th century===
In 1934, Amy Ashwood Garvey and Sam Manning opened the Florence Mills Social Club at number 50, a jazz club that became a gathering place for supporters of Pan-Africanism.

Carnaby Street in the early 1950s was a shabby Soho backstreet consisting of &quot;rag trade sweat shops, locksmiths and tailors, and a Central Electricity Board depot practically took up one side of the street.&quot; The genesis of Carnaby Street as a global fashion destination began with Bill &#x27;Vince&#x27; Green, a male physique photographer. In 1954 he opened a small clothing boutique, Vince, in adjoining Newburgh Street, to capitalise on the homosexual body-building community that congregated around the Marshall Street baths. Those who modelled for the Vince catalogue and advertisements, and boosted its popularity, were the then barely-known Sean Connery and the hugely popular handsome boxer Billy Walker. To further attract custom, Green hired pretty young men as sales assistants, one of whom was the Glasgow-born John Stephen, later to be known as &#x27;The King Of Carnaby Street&#x27;.

Stephen opened the boutique His Clothes in 1957 after his shop in Beak Street burned down. As Mary Quant later stated of Stephen, &quot;He made Carnaby Street. He was Carnaby Street. He invented a look for young men which was wildly exuberant, dashing and fun.&quot; According to James Gardiner, who at one stage made ties for the Vince boutique, at this period Carnaby Street &quot;was essentially a gay thing...The clothes, including pink shirts and skin-tight white pants, were designed to appeal to gay men, but soon went mainstream.&quot;

Stephen was followed by other men&#x27;s fashion retailers, including Gear, Mates and Ravel. In 1966, Harry Fox and Henry Moss opened the first women&#x27;s fashion boutique, Lady Jane, and later rented Foubert&#x27;s Place to I Was Lord Kitchener&#x27;s Valet, their first outlet in the area. Round the corner in Kingly Street, Tommy Roberts opened his gift shop, Kleptomania. He moved to Carnaby Street in 1967 and went on to become famous in the King&#x27;s Road, Chelsea, with his Mr Freedom shop.

By the 1960s, Carnaby Street was popular with followers of the mod, hippie and peacock revolution styles. Many independent fashion designers, such as Mary Quant, Marion Foale and Sally Tuffin, Lord John, Merc, Take Six, and Irvine Sellars had premises in the street, and various underground music bars, such as the Roaring Twenties, opened in the surrounding streets. Bands such as the Small Faces, the Who and the Rolling Stones appeared in the area, to work (at the legendary Marquee Club round the corner in Wardour Street), to shop and to socialise, so it became one of the coolest destinations associated with 1960s Swinging London.

The first Cranks restaurant was opened at 22 Carnaby Street in 1961 by David and Kay Canter and Daphne Swann. Cranks grew into a chain and has been seen as a major factor in the spread of vegetarianism in recent decades

The Carnaby Street contingent of Swinging London stormed into North American and international awareness with the 15 April 1966 publication of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s cover story that extolled this street&#x27;s role:

In October 1973, the Greater London Council pedestrianised the street. Vehicular access is restricted between 11 am and 8 pm. A comparison of pedestrian traffic before and after the change revealed that there had been a 30% increase in the number of pedestrians entering the area. In early 2010, a campaign was commenced for the pedestrianisation in the adjacent area of Soho.

Westminster City Council erected two green plaques, one at 1 Carnaby Street, dedicated to fashion entrepreneur John Stephen, who began the Mod fashion revolution, and another at 52/55 Carnaby Street, dedicated to the Mod pop group the Small Faces and their manager, Don Arden.

===21st century===
To celebrate the memory of Freddie Mercury after the release of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, the Carnaby Street arch got a rework with Queen&#x27;s logo being put up until early 2019.

Despite John Stephen closing his final business in 1975 (he died in 2004 aged 70) and the gradual movement to novelty shops with appeal to the ever increasing tourist trade, the boutique trade founded in Carnaby Street in 1957 by Stephen is still visible through the many shops of that ilk that still exist in the street today. Although featured in many books about London, the only book published which is exclusively about Carnaby Street and traces the history from the 1600s to 1970 is simply entitled &quot;Carnaby Street&quot; and was written by Tom Salter in 1970.

==Cultural impact==
In 1966 Lady Jane, the first ladies&#x27; fashion boutique opened, creating a public sensation when they had models getting dressed in the window, bringing Carnaby Street to a standstill. This typified the relaxed sexual attitude the era brought about.

Carnaby Street was satirised by The Kinks in their 1966 hit, &quot;Dedicated Follower of Fashion,&quot; which contains the line &quot;Everywhere the Carnabetian Army marches on, each one a dedicated follower of fashion.

It was mentioned in the 1967 film &quot;Smashing Time&quot;. One of the songs, &quot;Carnaby Street,&quot; features the lyric: &quot;You&#x27;ll pay for the gear on display to appear on the scene/ It&#x27;s no good being mean/ They&#x27;ll have your every bean.&quot;

In 1969, Peggy March recorded an album called &quot;In der Carnaby Street&quot;, with a hit song of the same name.

A song by The Jam, &quot;Carnaby Street,&quot; was written by bassist Bruce Foxton. It was the B-side of single &quot;All Around the World.&quot;

&quot;Carnaby Street the Musical&quot; opened in 2013. The show is set in the 1960s.
