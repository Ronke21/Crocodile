<text>In graph theory, graph coloring is a methodic assignment of labels traditionally called &quot;colors&quot; to elements of a graph. The assignment is subject to certain constraints, such as that no two adjacent elements have the same color. Graph coloring is a special case of graph labeling. In its simplest form, it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are of the same color; this is called a vertex coloring. Similarly, an &quot;edge coloring&quot; assigns a color to each edges so that no two adjacent edges are of the same color, and a face coloring of a planar graph assigns a color to each face (or region) so that no two faces that share a boundary have the same color.

Vertex coloring is often used to introduce graph coloring problems, since other coloring problems can be transformed into a vertex coloring instance. For example, an edge coloring of a graph is just a vertex coloring of its line graph, and a face coloring of a plane graph is just a vertex coloring of its dual. However, non-vertex coloring problems are often stated and studied as-is. This is partly pedagogical, and partly because some problems are best studied in their non-vertex form, as in the case of edge coloring.

The convention of using colors originates from coloring the countries in a political map, where each face is literally colored. This was generalized to coloring the faces of a graph embedded in the plane. By planar duality it became coloring the vertices, and in this form it generalizes to all graphs. In mathematical and computer representations, it is typical to use the first few positive or non-negative integers as the &quot;colors&quot;. In general, one can use any finite set as the &quot;color set&quot;. The nature of the coloring problem depends on the number of colors but not on what they are.

Graph coloring enjoys many practical applications as well as theoretical challenges. Beside the classical types of problems, different limitations can also be set on the graph, or on the way a color is assigned, or even on the color itself. It has even reached popularity with the general public in the form of the popular number puzzle Sudoku. Graph coloring is still a very active field of research.

== History ==

The first results about graph coloring deal almost exclusively with planar graphs in the form of map coloring.
While trying to color a map of the counties of England, Francis Guthrie postulated the four color conjecture, noting that four colors were sufficient to color the map so that no regions sharing a common border received the same color. Guthrie&#x27;s brother passed on the question to his mathematics teacher Augustus De Morgan at University College, who mentioned it in a letter to William Hamilton in 1852. Arthur Cayley raised the problem at a meeting of the London Mathematical Society in 1879. The same year, Alfred Kempe published a paper that claimed to establish the result, and for a decade the four color problem was considered solved. For his accomplishment Kempe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and later President of the London Mathematical Society.

In 1890, Percy John Heawood pointed out that Kempe&#x27;s argument was wrong. However, in that paper he proved the five color theorem, saying that every planar map can be colored with no more than &quot;five&quot; colors, using ideas of Kempe. In the following century, a vast amount of work was done and theories were developed to reduce the number of colors to four, until the four color theorem was finally proved in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken. The proof went back to the ideas of Heawood and Kempe and largely disregarded the intervening developments.
The proof of the four color theorem is noteworthy, aside from its solution of a century-old problem, for being the first major computer-aided proof.

In 1912, George David Birkhoff introduced the chromatic polynomial to study the coloring problem, which was generalised to the Tutte polynomial by W. T. Tutte, both of which are important invariants in algebraic graph theory. Kempe had already drawn attention to the general, non-planar case in 1879, and many results on generalisations of planar graph coloring to surfaces of higher order followed in the early 20th century.

In 1960, Claude Berge formulated another conjecture about graph coloring, the &quot;strong perfect graph conjecture&quot;, originally motivated by an information-theoretic concept called the zero-error capacity of a graph introduced by Shannon. The conjecture remained unresolved for 40 years, until it was established as the celebrated strong perfect graph theorem by Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas in 2002.

Graph coloring has been studied as an algorithmic problem since the early 1970s: the chromatic number problem (see section &quot;&quot; below) is one of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems from 1972, and at approximately the same time various exponential-time algorithms were developed based on backtracking and on the deletion-contraction recurrence of . One of the major applications of graph coloring, register allocation in compilers, was introduced in 1981.

== Definition and terminology ==


=== Vertex coloring ===

When used without any qualification, a coloring of a graph almost always refers to a &quot;proper vertex coloring&quot;, namely a labeling of the graph&#x27;s vertices with colors such that no two vertices sharing the same edge have the same color. Since a vertex with a loop (i.e. a connection directly back to itself) could never be properly colored, it is understood that graphs in this context are loopless.

The terminology of using &quot;colors&quot; for vertex labels goes back to map coloring. Labels like &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; are only used when the number of colors is small, and normally it is understood that the labels are drawn from the integers .
A coloring using at most colors is called a (proper) -coloring. The smallest number of colors needed to color a graph is called its chromatic number, and is often denoted . Sometimes is used, since is also used to denote the Euler characteristic of a graph. A graph that can be assigned a (proper) -coloring is -colorable, and it is -chromatic if its chromatic number is exactly . A subset of vertices assigned to the same color is called a &quot;color class&quot;, every such class forms an independent set. Thus, a -coloring is the same as a partition of the vertex set into independent sets, and the terms &quot;-partite&quot; and &quot;-colorable&quot; have the same meaning.

=== Chromatic polynomial ===

The chromatic polynomial counts the number of ways a graph can be colored using some of a given number of colors. For example, using three colors, the graph in the adjacent image can be colored in 12 ways. With only two colors, it cannot be colored at all. With four colors, it can be colored in 24 + 4 × 12 = 72 ways: using all four colors, there are 4! = 24 valid colorings (&quot;every&quot; assignment of four colors to &quot;any&quot; 4-vertex graph is a proper coloring); and for every choice of three of the four colors, there are 12 valid 3-colorings. So, for the graph in the example, a table of the number of valid colorings would start like this:
The chromatic polynomial is a function that counts the number of -colorings of . As the name indicates, for a given the function is indeed a polynomial in . For the example graph, , and indeed .

The chromatic polynomial includes more information about the colorability of than does the chromatic number. Indeed, is the smallest positive integer that is not a zero of the chromatic polynomial .

=== Edge coloring ===
An edge coloring of a graph is a proper coloring of the &quot;edges&quot;, meaning an assignment of colors to edges so that no vertex is incident to two edges of the same color. An edge coloring with colors is called a -edge-coloring and is equivalent to the problem of partitioning the edge set into matchings. The smallest number of colors needed for an edge coloring of a graph is the chromatic index, or edge chromatic number, . A Tait coloring is a 3-edge coloring of a cubic graph. The four color theorem is equivalent to the assertion that every planar cubic bridgeless graph admits a Tait coloring.

=== Total coloring ===
Total coloring is a type of coloring on the vertices &quot;and&quot; edges of a graph. When used without any qualification, a total coloring is always assumed to be proper in the sense that no adjacent vertices, no adjacent edges, and no edge and its end-vertices are assigned the same color. The total chromatic number of a graph is the fewest colors needed in any total coloring of .

=== Face coloring ===
For a graph with a strong embedding on a surface, the face coloring is the dual of the vertex coloring problem.

=== Tutte&#x27;s flow theory ===
For a graph &quot;G&quot; with a strong embedding on an orientable surface, William T. Tutte discovered that if the graph is &quot;k&quot;-face-colorable then &quot;G&quot; admits a nowhere-zero &quot;k&quot;-flow. The equivalence holds if the surface is sphere.

=== Unlabeled coloring ===
An unlabeled coloring of a graph is an orbit of a coloring under the action of the automorphism group of the graph. The colors remain labeled; it is the graph that is unlabeled.
There is an analogue of the chromatic polynomial which counts the number of unlabeled colorings of a graph from a given finite color set.

If we interpret a coloring of a graph on vertices as a vector in , the action of an automorphism is a permutation of the coefficients in the coloring vector.

== Properties ==

=== Upper bounds on the chromatic number ===
Assigning distinct colors to distinct vertices always yields a proper coloring, so
: formula_1

The only graphs that can be 1-colored are edgeless graphs. A complete graph formula_2 of &quot;n&quot; vertices requires formula_3 colors. In an optimal coloring there must be at least one of the graph&#x27;s &quot;m&quot; edges between every pair of color classes, so
: formula_4

More generally a family formula_5 of graphs is -bounded if there is some function formula_6 such that the graphs formula_7 in formula_5 can be colored with at most formula_9 colors, where formula_10 is the clique number of formula_7. For the family of the perfect graphs this function is formula_12.

The 2-colorable graphs are exactly the bipartite graphs, including trees and forests.
By the four color theorem, every planar graph can be 4-colored.

A greedy coloring shows that every graph can be colored with one more color than the maximum vertex degree,
: formula_13

Complete graphs have formula_14 and formula_15, and odd cycles have formula_16 and formula_17, so for these graphs this bound is best possible. In all other cases, the bound can be slightly improved; Brooks&#x27; theorem states that
: Brooks&#x27; theorem: formula_18 for a connected, simple graph &quot;G&quot;, unless &quot;G&quot; is a complete graph or an odd cycle.

=== Lower bounds on the chromatic number ===
Several lower bounds for the chromatic bounds have been discovered over the years:

If &quot;G&quot; contains a clique of size &quot;k&quot;, then at least &quot;k&quot; colors are needed to color that clique; in other words, the chromatic number is at least the clique number:
: formula_19

For perfect graphs this bound is tight. Finding cliques is known as the clique problem.

Hoffman&#x27;s bound: Let formula_20 be a real symmetric matrix such that formula_21 whenever formula_22 is not an edge in formula_7. Define formula_24, where formula_25 are the largest and smallest eigenvalues of formula_20. Define formula_27, with formula_20 as above. Then:
: formula_29

: Let formula_20 be a positive semi-definite matrix such that formula_31 whenever formula_22 is an edge in formula_7. Define formula_34 to be the least k for which such a matrix formula_20 exists. Then
: formula_36

Lovász number: The Lovász number of a complementary graph is also a lower bound on the chromatic number:
: formula_37

Fractional chromatic number: The fractional chromatic number of a graph is a lower bound on the chromatic number as well:
: formula_38

These bounds are ordered as follows:
: formula_39

=== Graphs with high chromatic number ===
Graphs with large cliques have a high chromatic number, but the opposite is not true. The Grötzsch graph is an example of a 4-chromatic graph without a triangle, and the example can be generalized to the Mycielskians.
: Theorem (, , ): There exist triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily high chromatic number.

To prove this, both, Mycielski and Zykov, each gave a construction of an inductively defined family of triangle-free graphs but with arbitrarily large chromatic number. constructed axis aligned boxes in formula_40 whose intersection graph is triangle-free and requires arbitrarily many colors to be properly colored. This family of graphs is then called the Burling graphs. The same class of graphs is used for the construction of a family of triangle-free line segments in the plane, given by Pawlik et al. (2014). It shows that the chromatic number of its intersection graph is arbitrarily large as well. Hence, this implies that axis aligned boxes in formula_40 as well as line segments in formula_42 are not &quot;χ&quot;-bounded.

From Brooks&#x27;s theorem, graphs with high chromatic number must have high maximum degree. But colorability is not an entirely local phenomenon: A graph with high girth looks locally like a tree, because all cycles are long, but its chromatic number need not be 2:
: Theorem (Erdős): There exist graphs of arbitrarily high girth and chromatic number.

=== Bounds on the chromatic index ===
An edge coloring of &quot;G&quot; is a vertex coloring of its line graph formula_43, and vice versa. Thus,
: formula_44

There is a strong relationship between edge colorability and the graph&#x27;s maximum degree formula_45. Since all edges incident to the same vertex need their own color, we have
: formula_46

Moreover,
: Kőnig&#x27;s theorem: formula_47 if &quot;G&quot; is bipartite.

In general, the relationship is even stronger than what Brooks&#x27;s theorem gives for vertex coloring:
: Vizing&#x27;s Theorem: A graph of maximal degree formula_48 has edge-chromatic number formula_48 or formula_50.

=== Other properties ===
A graph has a &quot;k&quot;-coloring if and only if it has an acyclic orientation for which the longest path has length at most &quot;k&quot;; this is the Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem .

For planar graphs, vertex colorings are essentially dual to nowhere-zero flows.

About infinite graphs, much less is known.
The following are two of the few results about infinite graph coloring:
*If all finite subgraphs of an infinite graph &quot;G&quot; are &quot;k&quot;-colorable, then so is &quot;G&quot;, under the assumption of the axiom of choice. This is the de Bruijn–Erdős theorem of .
*If a graph admits a full &quot;n&quot;-coloring for every &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;n&quot;0, it admits an infinite full coloring .

=== Open problems ===
As stated above, formula_51 A conjecture of Reed from 1998 is that the value is essentially closer to the lower bound, 
formula_52

The chromatic number of the plane, where two points are adjacent if they have unit distance, is unknown, although it is one of 5, 6, or 7. Other open problems concerning the chromatic number of graphs include the Hadwiger conjecture stating that every graph with chromatic number &quot;k&quot; has a complete graph on &quot;k&quot; vertices as a minor, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture bounding the chromatic number of unions of complete graphs that have at most one vertex in common to each pair, and the Albertson conjecture that among &quot;k&quot;-chromatic graphs the complete graphs are the ones with smallest crossing number.

When Birkhoff and Lewis introduced the chromatic polynomial in their attack on the four-color theorem, they conjectured that for planar graphs &quot;G&quot;, the polynomial formula_53 has no zeros in the region formula_54. Although it is known that such a chromatic polynomial has no zeros in the region formula_55 and that formula_56, their conjecture is still unresolved. It also remains an unsolved problem to characterize graphs which have the same chromatic polynomial and to determine which polynomials are chromatic.

== Algorithms ==
=== Polynomial time ===
Determining if a graph can be colored with 2 colors is equivalent to determining whether or not the graph is bipartite, and thus computable in linear time using breadth-first search or depth-first search. More generally, the chromatic number and a corresponding coloring of perfect graphs can be computed in polynomial time using semidefinite programming. Closed formulas for chromatic polynomials are known for many classes of graphs, such as forests, chordal graphs, cycles, wheels, and ladders, so these can be evaluated in polynomial time.

If the graph is planar and has low branch-width (or is nonplanar but with a known branch decomposition), then it can be solved in polynomial time using dynamic programming. In general, the time required is polynomial in the graph size, but exponential in the branch-width.

=== Exact algorithms ===
Brute-force search for a &quot;k&quot;-coloring considers each of the formula_57 assignments of &quot;k&quot; colors to &quot;n&quot; vertices and checks for each if it is legal. To compute the chromatic number and the chromatic polynomial, this procedure is used for every formula_58, impractical for all but the smallest input graphs.

Using dynamic programming and a bound on the number of maximal independent sets, &quot;k&quot;-colorability can be decided in time and space formula_59. Using the principle of inclusion–exclusion and Yates&#x27;s algorithm for the fast zeta transform, &quot;k&quot;-colorability can be decided in time formula_60 for any &quot;k&quot;. Faster algorithms are known for 3- and 4-colorability, which can be decided in time formula_61 and formula_62, respectively. Exponentially faster algorithms are also known for 5- and 6-colorability, as well as for restricted families of graphs, including sparse graphs.

=== Contraction ===
The contraction formula_63 of a graph &quot;G&quot; is the graph obtained by identifying the vertices &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, and removing any edges between them. The remaining edges originally incident to &quot;u&quot; or &quot;v&quot; are now incident to their identification (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the new fused node &quot;uv&quot;). This operation plays a major role in the analysis of graph coloring.

The chromatic number satisfies the recurrence relation:
: formula_64
due to , where &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are non-adjacent vertices, and formula_65 is the graph with the edge added. Several algorithms are based on evaluating this recurrence and the resulting computation tree is sometimes called a Zykov tree. The running time is based on a heuristic for choosing the vertices &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;.

The chromatic polynomial satisfies the following recurrence relation
: formula_66
where &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are adjacent vertices, and formula_67 is the graph with the edge removed. formula_68 represents the number of possible proper colorings of the graph, where the vertices may have the same or different colors. Then the proper colorings arise from two different graphs. To explain, if the vertices &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; have different colors, then we might as well consider a graph where &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are adjacent. If &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; have the same colors, we might as well consider a graph where &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are contracted. Tutte&#x27;s curiosity about which other graph properties satisfied this recurrence led him to discover a bivariate generalization of the chromatic polynomial, the Tutte polynomial.

These expressions give rise to a recursive procedure called the &quot;deletion–contraction algorithm&quot;, which forms the basis of many algorithms for graph coloring. The running time satisfies the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci numbers, so in the worst case the algorithm runs in time within a polynomial factor of formula_69 for &quot;n&quot; vertices and &quot;m&quot; edges. The analysis can be improved to within a polynomial factor of the number formula_70 of spanning trees of the input graph. In practice, branch and bound strategies and graph isomorphism rejection are employed to avoid some recursive calls. The running time depends on the heuristic used to pick the vertex pair.

=== Greedy coloring ===

The greedy algorithm considers the vertices in a specific order formula_71, ..., formula_72 and assigns to formula_73 the smallest available color not used by formula_73&#x27;s neighbours among formula_71, ..., formula_76, adding a fresh color if needed. The quality of the resulting coloring depends on the chosen ordering. There exists an ordering that leads to a greedy coloring with the optimal number of formula_77 colors. On the other hand, greedy colorings can be arbitrarily bad; for example, the crown graph on &quot;n&quot; vertices can be 2-colored, but has an ordering that leads to a greedy coloring with formula_78 colors.

For chordal graphs, and for special cases of chordal graphs such as interval graphs and indifference graphs, the greedy coloring algorithm can be used to find optimal colorings in polynomial time, by choosing the vertex ordering to be the reverse of a perfect elimination ordering for the graph. The perfectly orderable graphs generalize this property, but it is NP-hard to find a perfect ordering of these graphs.

If the vertices are ordered according to their degrees, the resulting greedy coloring uses at most formula_79 colors, at most one more than the graph&#x27;s maximum degree. This heuristic is sometimes called the Welsh–Powell algorithm. Another heuristic due to Brélaz establishes the ordering dynamically while the algorithm proceeds, choosing next the vertex adjacent to the largest number of different colors. Many other graph coloring heuristics are similarly based on greedy coloring for a specific static or dynamic strategy of ordering the vertices, these algorithms are sometimes called sequential coloring algorithms.

The maximum (worst) number of colors that can be obtained by the greedy algorithm, by using a vertex ordering chosen to maximize this number, is called the Grundy number of a graph.

=== Heuristic algorithms ===
Two well-known polynomial-time heuristics for graph colouring are the DSatur and recursive largest first (RLF) algorithms.

Similarly to the greedy colouring algorithm, DSatur colours the vertices of a graph one after another, expending a previously unused colour when needed. Once a new vertex has been coloured, the algorithm determines which of the remaining uncoloured vertices has the highest number of different colours in its neighbourhood and colours this vertex next. This is defined as the &quot;degree of saturation&quot; of a given vertex.

The recursive largest first algorithm operates in a different fashion by constructing each color class one at a time. It does this by identifying a maximal independent set of vertices in the graph using specialised heuristic rules. It then assigns these vertices to the same color and removes them from the graph. These actions are repeated on the remaining subgraph until no vertices remain.

The worst-case complexity of DSatur is formula_80, where formula_81 is the number of vertices in the graph. The algorithm can also be implemented using a binary heap to store saturation degrees, operating in formula_82 where formula_83 is the number of edges in the graph. This produces much faster runs with sparse graphs. The overall complexity of RLF is slightly higher than DSatur at formula_84.

DSatur and RLF are exact for bipartite, cycle, and wheel graphs.

=== Parallel and distributed algorithms ===
It is known that a -chromatic graph can be -colored in the deterministic LOCAL model, in formula_85. rounds, with formula_86. A matching lower bound of formula_87 rounds is also known. This lower bound holds even if quantum computers that can exchange quantum information, possibly with a pre-shared entangled state, are allowed. 

In the field of distributed algorithms, graph coloring is closely related to the problem of symmetry breaking. The current state-of-the-art randomized algorithms are faster for sufficiently large maximum degree Δ than deterministic algorithms. The fastest randomized algorithms employ the multi-trials technique by Schneider and Wattenhofer.

In a symmetric graph, a deterministic distributed algorithm cannot find a proper vertex coloring. Some auxiliary information is needed in order to break symmetry. A standard assumption is that initially each node has a &quot;unique identifier&quot;, for example, from the set . Put otherwise, we assume that we are given an &quot;n&quot;-coloring. The challenge is to &quot;reduce&quot; the number of colors from &quot;n&quot; to, e.g., Δ + 1. The more colors are employed, e.g. &quot;O&quot;(Δ) instead of Δ + 1, the fewer communication rounds are required.

A straightforward distributed version of the greedy algorithm for (Δ + 1)-coloring requires Θ(&quot;n&quot;) communication rounds in the worst case – information may need to be propagated from one side of the network to another side.

The simplest interesting case is an &quot;n&quot;-cycle. Richard Cole and Uzi Vishkin show that there is a distributed algorithm that reduces the number of colors from &quot;n&quot; to &quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;) in one synchronous communication step. By iterating the same procedure, it is possible to obtain a 3-coloring of an &quot;n&quot;-cycle in &quot;O&quot;( &quot;n&quot;) communication steps (assuming that we have unique node identifiers).

The function , iterated logarithm, is an extremely slowly growing function, &quot;almost constant&quot;. Hence the result by Cole and Vishkin raised the question of whether there is a &quot;constant-time&quot; distributed algorithm for 3-coloring an &quot;n&quot;-cycle. showed that this is not possible: any deterministic distributed algorithm requires Ω( &quot;n&quot;) communication steps to reduce an &quot;n&quot;-coloring to a 3-coloring in an &quot;n&quot;-cycle.

The technique by Cole and Vishkin can be applied in arbitrary bounded-degree graphs as well; the running time is poly(Δ) + &quot;O&quot;( &quot;n&quot;). The technique was extended to unit disk graphs by Schneider and Wattenhofer. The fastest deterministic algorithms for (Δ + 1)-coloring for small Δ are due to Leonid Barenboim, Michael Elkin and Fabian Kuhn. The algorithm by Barenboim et al. runs in time &quot;O&quot;(Δ) + (&quot;n&quot;)/2, which is optimal in terms of &quot;n&quot; since the constant factor 1/2 cannot be improved due to Linial&#x27;s lower bound. use network decompositions to compute a Δ+1 coloring in time formula_88.

The problem of edge coloring has also been studied in the distributed model. achieve a (2Δ − 1)-coloring in &quot;O&quot;(Δ +  &quot;n&quot;) time in this model. The lower bound for distributed vertex coloring due to applies to the distributed edge coloring problem as well.

=== Decentralized algorithms ===
Decentralized algorithms are ones where no message passing is allowed (in contrast to distributed algorithms where local message passing takes places), and efficient decentralized algorithms exist that will color a graph if a proper coloring exists. These assume that a vertex is able to sense whether any of its neighbors are using the same color as the vertex i.e., whether a local conflict exists. This is a mild assumption in many applications e.g. in wireless channel allocation it is usually reasonable to assume that a station will be able to detect whether other interfering transmitters are using the same channel (e.g. by measuring the SINR). This sensing information is sufficient to allow algorithms based on learning automata to find a proper graph coloring with probability one.

=== Computational complexity ===
Graph coloring is computationally hard. It is NP-complete to decide if a given graph admits a &quot;k&quot;-coloring for a given &quot;k&quot; except for the cases &quot;k&quot; ∈ . In particular, it is NP-hard to compute the chromatic number. The 3-coloring problem remains NP-complete even on 4-regular planar graphs. On graphs with maximal degree 3 or less, however, Brooks&#x27; theorem implies that the 3-coloring problem can be solved in linear time. Further, for every &quot;k&quot; &gt; 3, a &quot;k&quot;-coloring of a planar graph exists by the four color theorem, and it is possible to find such a coloring in polynomial time. However, finding the lexicographically smallest 4-coloring of a planar graph is NP-complete.

The best known approximation algorithm computes a coloring of size at most within a factor &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;(log log &quot;n&quot;)2(log n)−3) of the chromatic number. For all &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0, approximating the chromatic number within &quot;n&quot;1−&quot;ε&quot; is NP-hard.

It is also NP-hard to color a 3-colorable graph with 5 colors, 4-colorable graph with 7 colours, and a &quot;k&quot;-colorable graph with formula_89 colors for &quot;k&quot; ≥ 5.

Computing the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial is ♯P-hard. In fact, even computing the value of formula_90 is ♯P-hard at any rational point &quot;k&quot; except for &quot;k&quot; = 1 and &quot;k&quot; = 2. There is no FPRAS for evaluating the chromatic polynomial at any rational point &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1.5 except for &quot;k&quot; = 2 unless NP = RP.

For edge coloring, the proof of Vizing&#x27;s result gives an algorithm that uses at most Δ+1 colors. However, deciding between the two candidate values for the edge chromatic number is NP-complete. In terms of approximation algorithms, Vizing&#x27;s algorithm shows that the edge chromatic number can be approximated to within 4/3,
and the hardness result shows that no (4/3 − &quot;ε&quot;)-algorithm exists for any &quot;ε &gt; 0&quot; unless P = NP. These are among the oldest results in the literature of approximation algorithms, even though neither paper makes explicit use of that notion.

== Applications ==

=== Scheduling ===

Vertex coloring models to a number of scheduling problems. In the cleanest form, a given set of jobs need to be assigned to time slots, each job requires one such slot. Jobs can be scheduled in any order, but pairs of jobs may be in &quot;conflict&quot; in the sense that they may not be assigned to the same time slot, for example because they both rely on a shared resource. The corresponding graph contains a vertex for every job and an edge for every conflicting pair of jobs. The chromatic number of the graph is exactly the minimum &quot;makespan&quot;, the optimal time to finish all jobs without conflicts.

Details of the scheduling problem define the structure of the graph. For example, when assigning aircraft to flights, the resulting conflict graph is an interval graph, so the coloring problem can be solved efficiently. In bandwidth allocation to radio stations, the resulting conflict graph is a unit disk graph, so the coloring problem is 3-approximable.

=== Register allocation ===
A compiler is a computer program that translates one computer language into another. To improve the execution time of the resulting code, one of the techniques of compiler optimization is register allocation, where the most frequently used values of the compiled program are kept in the fast processor registers. Ideally, values are assigned to registers so that they can all reside in the registers when they are used.

The textbook approach to this problem is to model it as a graph coloring problem. The compiler constructs an &quot;interference graph&quot;, where vertices are variables and an edge connects two vertices if they are needed at the same time. If the graph can be colored with &quot;k&quot; colors then any set of variables needed at the same time can be stored in at most &quot;k&quot; registers.

=== Other applications===

The problem of coloring a graph arises in many practical areas such as sports scheduling, designing seating plans, exam timetabling, the scheduling of taxis, and solving Sudoku puzzles.

== Other colorings ==

=== Ramsey theory ===

An important class of &quot;improper&quot; coloring problems is studied in Ramsey theory, where the graph&#x27;s edges are assigned to colors, and there is no restriction on the colors of incident edges. A simple example is the theorem on friends and strangers, which states that in any coloring of the edges of formula_91, the complete graph of six vertices, there will be a monochromatic triangle; often illustrated by saying that any group of six people either has three mutual strangers or three mutual acquaintances. Ramsey theory is concerned with generalisations of this idea to seek regularity amid disorder, finding general conditions for the existence of monochromatic subgraphs with given structure.

; Exact coloring : Every pair of colors appears on exactly one edge
; Fractional coloring : Vertices may have multiple colors, and on each edge the sum of the color parts of each vertex is not greater than one
; Hamiltonian coloring : Uses the length of the longest path between two vertices, also known as the detour distance
; Harmonious coloring : Every pair of colors appears on at most one edge
; Incidence coloring: Each adjacent incidence of vertex and edge is colored with distinct colors
; Inherited vertex coloring : A set of vertex colorings induced by perfect matchings of edge-colored Graphs.
; Interval edge coloring : A color of edges meeting in a common vertex must be contiguous
; List coloring: Each vertex chooses from a list of colors
; List edge-coloring:Each edge chooses from a list of colors
; L(&quot;h&quot;, &quot;k&quot;)-coloring: Difference of colors at adjacent vertices is at least &quot;h&quot; and difference of colors of vertices at a distance two is at least &quot;k&quot;. A particular case is L(2,1)-coloring.

; Oriented coloring : Takes into account orientation of edges of the graph
; Path coloring : Models a routing problem in graphs
; Radio coloring : Sum of the distance between the vertices and the difference of their colors is greater than &quot;k&quot; + 1, where &quot;k&quot; is a positive integer.
; Rank coloring : If two vertices have the same color &quot;i&quot;, then every path between them contain a vertex with color greater than &quot;i&quot;
; Subcoloring : An improper vertex coloring where every color class induces a union of cliques
; Sum coloring : The criterion of minimalization is the sum of colors
; Star coloring : Every 2-chromatic subgraph is a disjoint collection of stars
; Strong coloring : Every color appears in every partition of equal size exactly once
; Strong edge coloring : Edges are colored such that each color class induces a matching (equivalent to coloring the square of the line graph)
; &quot;T&quot;-coloring : Absolute value of the difference between two colors of adjacent vertices must not belong to fixed set &quot;T&quot;
; Total coloring :Vertices and edges are colored
; Centered coloring: Every connected induced subgraph has a color that is used exactly once
; Triangle-free edge coloring: The edges are colored so that each color class forms a triangle-free subgraph
; Weak coloring : An improper vertex coloring where every non-isolated node has at least one neighbor with a different color

Coloring can also be considered for signed graphs and gain graphs.

<doc id="426744" wikidata="Q16849272" url="?curid=426744" title="International relations within the Comecon">
<text>The &quot;Council for Mutual Economic Assistance&quot; (Comecon) was an economic organization of communist states, created in 1949, and dissolved in 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union. International relations within Comecon is best discussed under three separate categories, as the nature of the relationships between the Soviet Union and its constituent members were not .

==The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe==
Since Comecon&#x27;s creation in 1949, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the seven East European countries had generally remained the same. The seven countries were: Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The Soviet Union had provided fuel, non-food raw materials, airplane and helicopter designs and semi-manufactures (&quot;hard goods&quot;) to Eastern Europe, which in turn, had supplied the Soviet Union with finished machinery, and industrial consumer goods (&quot;soft goods&quot;). 

This kind of economic relationship stemmed from a genuine economic problem within the Eastern communist states in the 1950s. Eastern Europe had poor energy and mineral resources, a problem exacerbated by the low energy efficiency of East European industry. As of mid-1985, factories in Eastern Europe still used 40% more fuel than those in the West. Eastern European countries have always relied heavily on the Soviet Union for oil. During the 1950s, Eastern Europe supplied the Soviet Union with those goods, otherwise unavailable, because of Western embargoes. 

Thus, from the early 1950s to the early 1970s, the Soviet Union inexpensively supplied its East European clients with hard goods in exchange for finished machinery and equipment. Soviet economic policies also brought with them, political and military support. During these years, the Soviet Union could be assured of relative political tranquillity within the bloc, obedience in international strategy, as laid down by the Soviet Union, and military support of Soviet aims. By the 1980s, both parties were accustomed to this arrangement, which was still particularly advantageous to The Soviet Union, as it could expand its energy and raw materials complex quickly, and relatively cheaply. 

In the 1970s, the terms of trade for the Soviet Union had improved. The OPEC price for oil had soared, placing the oil-rich Soviet Union in an advantageous position. The soaring price increased the cost of providing Eastern Europe with oil at prices lower than those established by OPEC. In addition, extraction and transportation costs for oil, much of which originated in Siberia, was also rising. In response to the market, the Soviet Union decreased its exports to its East European partners and increased its purchases of soft goods from these countries. This policy forced the East European countries to turn to the West for hard goods, despite the fact that they had fewer goods to export in return for hard currency. 

Any hard goods supplied to Eastern Europe by the Soviet Union were sold essentially at a discount price, as Comecon prices lagged behind, and were lower than those of the world market. Developments in the 1980s made this situation even more complex. The 1983–84 decline in international oil prices left the Soviets with large holdings of oil that, because of the lag in Comecon prices, were still rising in price. The &quot;non-market gains from preferential trade&quot; became quite expensive for the Soviets. East European profits from the implicit subsidization were almost US$102 billion between 1971 and 1981.

==Mongolia, Cuba, and Vietnam==
Soviet-initiated Comecon support for the Council&#x27;s three least-developed members, Cuba, Mongolia, and Vietnam, benefited them, but the burden on the seven East European Comecon members had been most unwelcome. Comecon was structured in such a way that the more economically developed members provided support to the less developed members in their major economic sectors. When Mongolia initially joined the Comecon in 1962, there was no great added burden. The population of Mongolia was relatively small, and the country&#x27;s subsidies came primarily from the Soviet Union. But the addition of Cuba in 1972, and Vietnam in 1978, quickly escalated this burden. As of early 1987, three-fourths of Comecon&#x27;s overseas economic aid went to Cuba, Mongolia, and Vietnam: almost US$4 billion went to Cuba, US$2 billion to Vietnam (half in military aid), and US$1 billion to Mongolia. 

Although the Soviets carried most of the burden since 1976, the East Europeans had been persuaded to take part in projects to boost the developing countries&#x27; economies. East European countries imported Cuban nickel, and Mongolian molybdenum and copper. They were also pressed to buy staples, such as Cuban sugar (80% of Cuba&#x27;s exports), at inflated prices. Eastern Europe also contributed to the International Investment Bank, from which the underdeveloped three could acquire loans at lower interest rates than the East Europeans themselves. The Soviets also sold their fuel and raw materials to Cuba, Vietnam, and Mongolia for less than it was sold to the seven East European members. Hence, the former had become competitors for the slowly diminishing Soviet resources. In the late 1980s, the only benefit accruing to the East Europeans was the services provided by Vietnamese guest workers. However, the majority of the Vietnamese had worked primarily on the Druzhba pipeline in/between the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 

Comecon was investing heavily in Mongolia, Cuba, and Vietnam, and the three countries had benefited substantially from its resources. In 1984, increases in capital investments within Comecon were the highest for Vietnam and Cuba — coming to 26.9% for Vietnam, and 14% for Cuba, compared with 3.3% and less, for the others, except Poland and Romania. Increased investments in Mongolia lagged behind Poland and Romania, but were nevertheless substantial, at 5.8%. In 1984, the economies of the three developing countries registered the fastest industrial growth of all the Comecon members. 

Given their locations, Comecon membership for Mongolia, Cuba, and Vietnam principally served Soviet foreign policy interests. The Soviet Union contributed the most to the development of the three poorer Comecon members, and it also reaped most of the benefits. It imported most of Cuba&#x27;s sugar and nickel, and all of Mongolia&#x27;s copper and molybdenum (widely used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, machine tools, gas turbines, and in the field of electronics). Cuba had provided bases for the Soviet Navy, and military support to Soviet allies in Africa. Vietnam made its naval and air bases, as well as some 100,000 guest workers, available to the Soviets. As of 1989 there were also approximately 59,000 Vietnamese guest workers in East Germany, called Vertragsarbeiter (contract workers).

At the June 1984 Comecon economic summit, and at subsequent Council sessions, the policy of equalizing the levels of economic development between Comecon member countries was repeatedly stressed. At the November 1986 Comecon session in Bucharest, the East European members &quot;outlined measures to further improve cooperation with Vietnam, Cuba, and Mongolia with a view to developing the main sectors of these countries&#x27; national economies&quot;. Moreover, the Soviets have repeatedly stressed their earnestness in &quot;normalizing the situation in the Asia-Pacific region, and in including that region in the overall process of creating a universal system of international security&quot;.

==Support for developing countries==
Comecon provided economic and technical support to 34 developing countries in 1960, 62 countries in 1970, and over 100 countries in 1985. As of 1987, Comecon had assisted in the construction or preparation of over 4,000 mostly industrial projects in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. A monetary figure for this assistance was difficult to estimate, although a June 1986 Czechoslovak source valued the exchange between Comecon and developing countries at 34 billion Rbls per year, the equivalent of US$44.2 billion. The precise nature of this aid was unclear, and Western observers believe the data to be inflated. 

From the 1960s to the mid-1980s, Comecon had sought to encourage the development of industry, energy, transportation, mineral resources, and agriculture of Third World countries. Comecon countries had also provided technical and economic training for personnel in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. When Comecon initially lent support to developing countries, it generally concentrated on developing those products that would support the domestic economies of the Third World, including replacements for imports. In the 1970s and 1980s, assistance from Comecon had been directed toward export-oriented industries. Third World countries had paid for this support with products, produced by the project for which Comecon rendered help. This policy had provided Comecon with a stable source of necessary deliveries, in addition to political influence in these strategically important areas.

<text>The Jacquerie () was a popular revolt by peasants that took place in northern France in the early summer of 1358 during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The revolt was centred in the valley of the Oise north of Paris and was suppressed after over two months of violence. This rebellion became known as &quot;the Jacquerie&quot; because the nobles derided peasants as &quot;Jacques&quot; or &quot;Jacques Bonhomme&quot; for their padded surplice, called a &quot;jacque&quot;. The aristocratic chronicler Jean Froissart and his source, the chronicle of Jean le Bel, referred to the leader of the revolt as Jacque Bonhomme (&quot;Jack Goodfellow&quot;), though in fact the Jacquerie &#x27;great captain&#x27; was named Guillaume Cale. The word &quot;jacquerie&quot; became a synonym of peasant uprisings in general in both English and French.

==Background==
After the capture of the French king (John II, Froissart&#x27;s &quot;bon roi Jean&quot; &quot;good king John&quot;) by the English during the Battle of Poitiers in September 1356, power in France devolved fruitlessly among the Estates-General and John&#x27;s son, the Dauphin, later Charles V.

The Estates-General were too divided to provide effective government and their alliance with King Charles II of Navarre, another claimant to the French throne, provoked disunity amongst the nobles. Consequently, the prestige of the French nobility sank to a new low. The century had begun poorly for the nobles at Courtrai (the &quot;Battle of the Golden Spurs&quot;), where they fled the field and left their infantry to be hacked to pieces; they were also accused of having given up their king at the Battle of Poitiers. The passage of a law that required the peasants to defend the &quot;châteaux&quot; that were emblems of their oppression was the immediate cause of the spontaneous uprising. The law was particularly resented as many commoners already blamed the nobility for the defeat at Poitiers. The chronicle of Jean de Venette articulates the perceived problems between the nobility and the peasants, yet some historians, such as Samuel K. Cohn, see the Jacquerie revolts as a reaction to a combination of short- and long-term effects dating from as early as the grain crisis and famine of 1315.

In addition, as a result of the temporary lull in hostilities of the Hundred Years&#x27; War due to the French defeat at Poitiers, thousands of soldiers and mercenaries on both sides of the conflict found themselves &quot;without commanders or wages&quot;. Many of them responded by forming free companies, attacking both military and civilian targets such as castles and villages (often to ransom for a profit) and engaging in frequent acts of rape, looting and murder. Their ability to do so was exacerbated by the lack of an efficient government authority in many parts of France, which left the French peasantry disillusioned with France&#x27;s nobility that was perceived as failing to meet its feudal obligations.

==Uprising==

This combination of problems set the stage for a brief series of bloody rebellions in northern France in 1358. The uprisings began in a village of St. Leu near the Oise river, where a group of peasants met to discuss their perception that the nobles had abandoned the King at Poitiers. &quot;They shamed and despoiled the realm, and it would be a good thing to destroy them all.&quot;

The account of the rising by the contemporary chronicler Jean le Bel includes a description of horrifying violence:

Examples of violence on this scale by the French peasants are offered throughout the medieval sources, including accounts by Jean de Venette and Jean Froissart, an aristocrat who was particularly unsympathetic to the peasants. Among the chroniclers, the one sympathetic to their plight is Jean de Venette, sometimes (but erroneously) known as the continuator of the chronicle of Guillaume de Nangis.

Jean le Bel speculated that governors and tax collectors spread the word of rebellion from village to village to inspire the peasants to rebel against the nobility. When asked as to the cause of their discontent they apparently replied that they were just doing what they had witnessed others doing. Additionally it seems that the rebellion contained some idea that it was possible to rid the world of nobles. Froissart&#x27;s account portrays the rebels as mindless savages bent on destruction, which they wrought on over 150 noble houses and castles, murdering the families in horrific ways. The bourgeoisie of Beauvais, Senlis, Paris, Amiens, and Meaux, sorely pressed by the court party, accepted the Jacquerie, and the urban underclass were sympathetic. Village notables often provided leadership for some of the peasant bands, although in letters of pardon issued after the suppression of the rising, such individuals claimed that they were forced to do so.

The Jacquerie must be seen in the context of this period of internal instability. At a time of personal government, the absence of a charismatic king was detrimental to the still-feudal state. The Dauphin had to contend with roaming free companies of out-of-work mercenaries, the plotting of Charles the Bad, and the possibility of another English invasion. The Dauphin gained effective control of the realm only after the supposed surrender of the city of Paris after the murder of the leader of the Estates General Étienne Marcel, &quot;prevôt des marchands&quot; on 31 July 1358. It is notable that churches were not generally the targets of peasant fury, with the possible exception of some clerics in Champagne.

==Suppression==
The revolt was suppressed by French nobles and gentry led by the Dauphin and Charles of Navarre, cousin, brother-in-law, and mortal enemy of the Regent, whose throne he was attempting to usurp. His army and the peasant force opposed each other near Mello on 10 June 1358, when Guillaume Cale, the leader of the rebellion, was invited to truce talks by Charles. He went to the enemy camp, where he was seized by the French nobles, who considered that the conventions and standards of chivalry did not apply to him; he was tortured and decapitated.

The now leaderless army, which Froisart claimed to be 100,000 strong in his narrative heavily influenced by chivalric romance, was ridden down by divisions of mounted knights. In the ensuing Battle of Mello and in a campaign of terror throughout Beauvais, knights, squires, men-at-arms and mercenaries roamed the countryside lynching peasants.

Another major battle transpired at Meaux, where the fortified citadel was crowded with knights and their dependents. On 9 June, a band of some 800 armed commoners (not the 10,000 Jacques of Froissart&#x27;s account) came out of Paris under the leadership of Etienne Marcel to support the rising. When the band from Paris appeared before Meaux, they were taken in hospitably by the disaffected townspeople and fed. The fortress, somewhat apart from the town, remained unassailable.

Two captain adventurers, returning from the Prussian Crusade, were at Châlons: Gaston III, Count of Foix and his noble Gascon cousin, Jean III de Grailly. The approach of their well-armed lancers encouraged the besieged nobles in the fortress, and a general rout of the Parisian force ensued. The nobles then set fire to the suburb nearest the fortress, entrapping the burghers in the flames. The mayor of Meaux and other prominent men of the city were hanged. There was a pause, and then the force led by the nobles and gentry plundered the city and churches and set fire to Meaux, which burned for two weeks. They then overran the countryside, burning cottages and barns and slaughtering all the peasants they could find.

The reprisals continued through July and August. Senlis defended itself. Knights of County of Hainaut, County of Flanders, and Duchy of Brabant joined in the carnage. Following the declaration of amnesty issued by the Regent on 10 August 1358, such heavy fines were assessed upon the regions that had supported the Jacquerie that a general flight ensued. Historian Barbara Tuchman says: &quot;Like every insurrection of the century, it was smashed, as soon as the rulers recovered their nerve, by weight of steel, and the advantages of the man on horseback, and the psychological inferiority of the insurgents&quot;.

The slanted but vivid account of Froissart can be balanced by the Regent&#x27;s letter of general amnesty, a document that comments as severely on the nobles&#x27; reaction as on the peasants&#x27; rising and omits the atrocities detailed by Froissart: &quot;it represents the men of the open country assembling spontaneously in various localities, in order to deliberate on the means of resisting the English, and suddenly, as with a mutual agreement, turning fiercely on the nobles&quot;.

The Jacquerie traumatized the aristocracy. In 1872 Louis Raymond de Vericour remarked to the Royal Historical Society:
==In the arts==
*The contemporary literary chronicles were influenced by other medieval genres: romance, satire, and complaint.
*The subject of the Jacquerie engaged the Romantic historical imagination, resulting in numerous nineteenth-century historical novels with somewhat operatic plots set against the backdrop of the Jacquerie—&quot;The Jacquerie, or, The Lady and the Page: An Historical Romance&quot; by G. P. R James (1842) and the like— and even an opera, &quot;La jacquerie&quot;, by Édouard Lalo.
*In Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, the revolutionaries call themselves &quot;Jacques&quot;.
*Eugène Sue&#x27;s novel &quot;The Iron Trevet&quot; (part of Sue&#x27;s &quot;Mysteries of the People&quot; sequence) gives a sympathetic account of the Jacquerie rebels.
*In Thomas Love Peacock&#x27;s &quot;Crotchet Castle&quot;, Dr Folliott compares a local riot with the Jacquerie and expresses nostalgia for &quot;that blessed middle period, after the Jacquerie was down and before the March of Mind was up&quot;.
*Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The White Company&quot; includes a chapter where the English free company of the title rescue French nobility from peasants of the Jacquerie - portrayed as savage and brutish.
*The 1961 novel &quot;A Walk with Love and Death&quot; by Hans Koningsberger takes place in northern France during the Jacquerie. The revolt provided the basis for a film of the same name directed by John Huston in 1969.
*A somewhat fictionalized version of the Jacquerie is featured in the 1962 &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; comic album &quot;The Time Trap&quot;.
* German progressive rock band Eloy&#x27;s 1975 concept album &quot;Power and the Passion&quot; partially takes place in France in 1358 with the Jacquerie being an important part of the story.
* In the satirical short story ‘The Stampeding of Lady Bastable’ c.1911 by Saki (Hector Hugh Munro) the following appears: ‘...Lady Bastable was roused from the world of newspaper lore by hearing a Japanese screen in the hall go down with a crash. Then the door leading from the hall flew open and her young guest tore madly through the room, shrieked at her in passing, &quot;The jacquerie! They&#x27;re on us!&quot; and dashed like an escaping hawk out through the French window. The scared mob of servants burst in on his heels, the gardener still clutching the sickle with which he had been trimming hedges, and the impetus of their headlong haste carried them, slipping and sliding, over the smooth parquet flooring towards the chair where their mistress sat in panic-stricken amazement.’

<doc id="426746" wikidata="Q3069747" url="?curid=426746" title="Cornsweet illusion">
<text>The Cornsweet illusion, also known as the Craik–O&#x27;Brien–Cornsweet illusion or the Craik–Cornsweet illusion, is an optical illusion that was described in detail by Tom Cornsweet in the late 1960s. Kenneth Craik and Vivian O&#x27;Brien had made earlier observations in a similar vein.

The original version of the illusion involved a rapidly spinning black-and-white disk, painted in a way that would create the appearance of a gradient effect when in motion. An equivalent static version of illusion is composed of a gray rectangle where the left half fades to a lighter shade as it approaches a vertical center line, and the right half fades to a darker gray approaching the same line. As a result, the whole left half of the rectangle appears lighter than the right half, but in fact the brightness of both areas is exactly the same. This can be seen by blacking out the region containing the edge.

This phenomenon is similar to the phenomenon of simultaneous contrast and Mach bands, but differs from it in two important respects.
*In Mach bands, the effect is seen only on areas that are close to the intensity gradient. In the Craik–O&#x27;Brien–Cornsweet illusion, a very small area (the central &quot;edge&quot;) affects the perception of entire large areas, portions of which are distant from the edge.
*In the Cornsweet illusion, the region adjacent to the light part of the edge appears lighter, and the region adjacent to the dark part of the edge appears darker, just the opposite of the usual contrast effects.

A far more convincing and dramatic version of the effect can be seen in the article by Purves, Lotto, and Nundy, where it is presented within a quasi-realistic image of solid, illuminated objects. These writers give an explanation of this and other illusions, in which the visual system and brain are posited to generate percepts on an empirical basis that is much like a reflex. In their words, &quot;... [perception] accords not with the features of the retinal stimulus or the properties of the underlying objects, but with what the same or similar stimuli have typically signified in the past.&quot;

<text>Devin Garrett Townsend (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. He founded extreme metal band Strapping Young Lad and was its primary songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist from 1994 to 2007. He has also had an extensive solo career and has released a total of 29 albums across all of his projects as of 2024.

After performing in a number of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered in 1993 by a record label who asked him to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai&#x27;s album &quot;Sex &amp; Religion&quot;. After recording and touring with Vai, he was discouraged by what he found in the music industry and vented his anger on his 1995 solo album &quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing&quot;, which he released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band of the same name, with whom he released the critically acclaimed album &quot;City&quot; in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent HevyDevy Records label.

Townsend&#x27;s solo albums have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians and are a mix of hard rock, progressive metal, ambient, and new-age. In 2002, he formed the Devin Townsend Band, which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases. In 2007, he disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and the Devin Townsend Band, taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family. After a two-year hiatus, he began recording again and soon announced the formation of the Devin Townsend Project. This band began with a series of four albums, released from 2009 to 2011 and each written in a different genre. Townsend continued to record and tour under the new moniker until January 2018.

Across all his bands and solo projects, Townsend has released 23 studio albums and four live albums. His trademark production style, featuring a heavily multi-tracked wall of sound, has been compared to the styles of Robert Fripp and Frank Zappa. His vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an opera-esque singing, while his musical style is rooted in metal and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality.

==Biography==
===Early musical career (1972–1994)===
Devin Garrett Townsend was born in New Westminster on May 5, 1972. His parents are of Irish and British descent, with his father working in the restaurant industry. He picked up the banjo when he was five and began playing guitar when he was 12. As a young teenager, he befriended Brian &quot;Beav&quot; Waddell, who would later play guitars as part of the Devin Townsend Band and bass on the Devin Townsend Project. He participated in several metal bands while he was in high school, and founded Grey Skies at the age of 19. Around the same time he joined a popular local group called Caustic Thought, replacing Jed Simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist Byron Stroud, both of whom would later become members of Townsend&#x27;s flagship band, Strapping Young Lad. In 1993, Townsend began writing material under the name Noisescapes, a project he later described as &quot;just as violent as Strapping Young Lad&quot;.

Townsend recorded a Noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels. Relativity Records responded to Townsend with a record deal and Townsend began work on what was to be the first Noisescapes album, &quot;Promise&quot;. Shortly afterward, the label introduced him to musician Steve Vai. Impressed with Townsend&#x27;s vocal work, Vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album &quot;Sex &amp; Religion&quot;. After recording &quot;Sex &amp; Religion&quot;, Townsend accompanied Vai on a world tour in support of the album. Townsend soon landed a second tour, this time with the opening band of Vai&#x27;s tour, the Wildhearts. He played live with the band throughout half of 1994 in Europe, and appeared as a guest musician on their single Urge. Ginger, the band&#x27;s frontman, remained close friends with Townsend, later co-writing several songs on &quot;Infinity&quot; and the &quot;Christeen + 4 Demos&quot; EP.

While on tour with the Wildhearts, Townsend formed a short-lived thrash metal project with Metallica&#x27;s then-bassist Jason Newsted. The band, known as IR8, featured Newsted on vocals and bass, Townsend on guitar, and Tom Hunting of Exodus on drums. The group recorded a few songs together, although Townsend says that they never intended to go further than that. &quot;People heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a CD, which is absolutely not true,&quot; he explains. &quot;People took this project way too seriously.&quot; A demo tape was put together, but the material was not released until 2002, when Newsted published the IR8 vs. Sexoturica compilation.

Though Townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. &quot;I was becoming a product of somebody else&#x27;s imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality,&quot; he later reflected. &quot;This combination was appalling.&quot; He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite touring with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai&#x27;s offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend&#x27;s music. &quot;I have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with Steve,&quot; he mused. While touring with the Wildhearts, Townsend received a phone call from Monte Conner, then-A&amp;R representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. After being briefly signed by the label, the offer was ultimately rescinded by Cees Wessels, the owner of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend&#x27;s recordings as &quot;just noise&quot;.

===&quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing&quot; through &quot;Infinity&quot; (1994–1998)===
In 1994, Century Media Records offered Townsend a contract to make &quot;some extreme albums&quot;. He agreed to a five-album deal with the record label, and also provided much of the guitar work on the 1994 album &quot;Millennium&quot; and the 1995 album &quot;Hard Wired&quot; by Vancouver industrial band Front Line Assembly. Townsend began to record material under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He avoided using his real name at this point in career, looking for a fresh start after his high-profile Vai gig. &quot;At the beginning, I wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasn&#x27;t the best publicity to have,&quot; he later explained. &quot;I was playing somebody else&#x27;s music and I was judged in respect to that music.&quot; Townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album, &quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing&quot;, which was released in April 1995.

Following the release of the record, Townsend and several other musician friends, Chris Valagao Mina, guitarist, vocal of Zimmers Hole, he knew in Vancouver recorded a rock opera in 1996 entitled &quot;Punky Brüster – Cooked on Phonics&quot;. Written and recorded in under a month, the album tells the fictional story of a death metal band from Poland that sells out becoming a punk rock band to achieve mainstream success. Townsend founded his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records, to release the album.

Townsend assembled a permanent lineup of Strapping Young Lad to record &quot;City&quot;, including prolific metal drummer Gene Hoglan (Dark Angel, Death, Testament), along with Townsend&#x27;s former bandmates Jed Simon on guitar and Byron Stroud on bass. The industrial-influenced album was released in 1997. To this day, the album is widely considered Strapping Young Lad&#x27;s best work, with &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot; calling it &quot;groundbreaking&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; naming it &quot;one of the greatest metal albums of all time&quot;. Townsend himself considers it the band&#x27;s &quot;ultimate&quot; album. Later that year, Townsend released his second solo album, &quot;Ocean Machine: Biomech&quot; with a guitarist Chris Valagao Mina. The album featured a mix of hard rock, ambient, and progressive rock.
Dating back to the &quot;Sex and Religion&quot; tour, Townsend had been writing solo material for a project called Ocean Machine. The album, initially entitled &quot;Biomech&quot;, was recorded in 1995 and originally queued for release later that year in December on HevyDevy Records, a label created by Townsend solely for material he releases on his own. Due to unknown reasons, &quot;Ocean Machine: Biomech&quot; was put off for release until late 1996, but when the time came to finally release it Townsend had become unsatisfied with the recordings, rerecorded the entire album, and finally released in Japan on July 21, 1997.

During this period, Townsend was also asked to audition for the lead vocalist spot in Judas Priest after Rob Halford&#x27;s departure. Though a fan of the band, he turned down the offer, explaining that: &quot;No one would want to see Devin Townsend singing for Judas Priest. I mean, it&#x27;s ridiculous.&quot;

After the completion of &quot;City&quot; and &quot;Ocean Machine: Biomech&quot;, Townsend began to approach a mental breakdown. He explained, &quot;I started to see human beings as little lonesome, water based, pink meat life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand.&quot; In December 1997, he checked himself into a mental-health hospital, where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from; he felt his disorder &quot;gave birth to the two extremes that are Strapping&#x27;s &quot;City&quot; record and &quot;Ocean Machine: Biomech&quot;.&quot; After being discharged from the hospital, Townsend found that &quot;everything just clicked&quot; and he was able to write his third solo album, &quot;Infinity&quot;, which he described as &quot;the parent project&quot; of &quot;City&quot; and &quot;Ocean Machine: Biomech&quot;, with music influenced by Broadway. Townsend returned to the studio, accompanied by Hoglan, to work on the album, on which Townsend played most of the instruments. &quot;Infinity&quot; was released in October 1998. Later in his career, Townsend has cited &quot;Infinity&quot; as his favorite solo record.

With &quot;Infinity&quot;, Townsend began to label all albums outside of Strapping Young Lad under his own name, dropping the Ocean Machine moniker, to reduce confusion. He wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects, they are all simply aspects of his identity. The album &quot;Biomech&quot; was relabeled and redistributed as &quot;Ocean Machine: Biomech&quot;, under Townsend&#x27;s name, to reflect the new arrangement. In 1998, the international tour began in many countries, Chris Valagao Mina the guitarist joined Devin project.

===&quot;Physicist&quot; and &quot;Terria&quot; (1999–2001)===

Townsend&#x27;s next project took several years to come to fruition. After the creation of the IR8 demo tape, Townsend and Jason Newsted had begun work on a new project called &quot;Fizzicist&quot;, which they described as &quot;heavier than Strapping Young Lad&quot;. When the IR8 tape was leaked, Newsted&#x27;s Metallica bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich learned of the project. Hetfield was &quot;fucking pissed&quot; that Newsted was playing outside the band, and Newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects, although Townsend would later downplay Metallica&#x27;s role in Newsted&#x27;s unavailability. With the project stalled, Townsend instead wrote the album himself, entitling it &quot;Physicist&quot;. Townsend assembled his Strapping Young Lad bandmates to record it, the only time this lineup was featured on a Devin Townsend album. The thrash-influenced &quot;Physicist&quot; was released in June 2000, and is generally considered a low point in Townsend&#x27;s career. Hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed, and Townsend considers it his worst album to date.

Feeling he had &quot;ostracized a bunch of fans&quot; with &quot;Physicist&quot;, Townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record. Townsend was inspired one morning while driving across Canada with his band, and looked to write an &quot;introspective&quot; album dedicated to his homeland. He produced and recorded &quot;Terria&quot;, a &quot;highly illustrated stream-of-consciousness&quot; album, with Gene Hoglan on drums, Craig McFarland on bass and Jamie Meyer on keyboards. Townsend cited Ween&#x27;s &quot;White Pepper&quot; as an inspiration for the album. &quot;Terria&quot; was released in November 2001.

===&quot;Strapping Young Lad&quot; through &quot;Synchestra&quot; (2002–2006)===
Townsend&#x27;s solo run lasted until 2002. After a five-year break from recording, Strapping Young Lad reunited to record a new album. Townsend credits the album, &quot;Strapping Young Lad&quot;, as an emotional response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, in the United States. &quot;If the world&#x27;s about to blow up,&quot; said Townsend, &quot;let&#x27;s write the soundtrack for it.&quot; The album&#x27;s lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the &quot;hostile&quot; lyrics of &quot;City&quot;. Musically, &quot;Strapping Young Lad&quot; was less industrial than &quot;City&quot;, and more reminiscent of death metal, with a &quot;larger-than-life&quot; rock production style. Townsend cited Front Line Assembly, Grotus, and Samael&#x27;s &quot;Passage&quot; as influences. The self-titled album was released in February 2003. It received lukewarm reviews, with critics finding it inferior to &quot;City&quot;, but it was the band&#x27;s first charting album, entering at 97th place on Billboard&#x27;s Top Heatseekers chart.

While Strapping Young Lad was being reunited, Townsend formed a new, permanent band &quot;on par with Strapping&quot; to record and tour for his solo releases. The Devin Townsend Band consisted of Brian &quot;Beav&quot; Waddell on guitar, Mike Young on bass, Ryan Van Poederooyen on drums, and Dave Young on keyboards. Townsend performed guitar, vocals, and production, as he did in Strapping Young Lad. Townsend worked on the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot;, at the same time he was working on &quot;Strapping Young Lad&quot;, spending half the week on one and half on the other. &quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot;, named for the pace of putting a new band together in under a year, was released a month after &quot;Strapping Young Lad&quot;. Mike G. of &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot; called it &quot;the album of the year&quot;, praising it for &quot;the hard-to-accomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible, simultaneously heavy &#x27;n&#x27; rockin&#x27; yet majestic and beautiful.&quot; Prior to the formation of the Devin Townsend Band, Townsend had represented his solo releases live with the Strapping Young Lad lineup; the band would play one set of Strapping Young Lad songs and one set of Devin Townsend songs. After the release of &quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot;, Townsend&#x27;s two bands toured separately for their separate albums.

Strapping Young Lad began working on their next album, &quot;Alien&quot;, in March 2004. Feeling that the band&#x27;s previous album did not live up to expectations, Townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme. During the process of writing and recording the new album, Townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder because he began expressing doubt about the initial diagnosis, and decided to stop taking the medication, but continued with his substance abuse, and he eventually &quot;flipped out&quot; during the process, and later called the resulting album &quot;toxic&quot; and &quot;psychologically very unhealthy&quot;. Although Townsend considered the album an &quot;impenetrable mass of technicality&quot;, it was well received on its release, selling 3,697 copies in its first week and appearing on several Billboard charts. Around this time, Townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game &quot;&quot;.

Shortly thereafter Townsend began putting together the next Devin Townsend Band record, with the working title &quot;Human&quot;. Townsend intended the album as the more &quot;pleasant&quot; counterpart to &quot;Alien&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with &quot;Alien&quot; for a while.&quot; The album ended up being renamed &quot;Synchestra&quot; and was released in January 2006. Townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in &quot;Synchestra&quot;, blending his trademark &quot;pop metal&quot; with influences from folk, polka, and Middle Eastern music.
The final Strapping Young Lad album, &quot;The New Black&quot;, was released later in 2006.

===&quot;Ziltoid the Omniscient&quot; and hiatus (2006–2008)===
From home, Townsend completed his second solo ambient album, &quot;The Hummer&quot;, releasing it exclusively on his website in November 2006.

In May 2007, Townsend released &quot;Ziltoid the Omniscient&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek rock opera about the eponymous fictional alien. This was truly a solo album; he programmed the drums using Drumkit from Hell, a software drum machine that uses samples recorded by Tomas Haake of Meshuggah and played all other instruments himself. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Townsend announced that he no longer planned to tour or make albums with Strapping Young Lad or the Devin Townsend Band. He explained that he was &quot;burnt out on travelling, touring, and self promotion&quot; and wished to do production work, write albums, and spend time with his family without the stress of interviews or touring.

In 2008, Townsend lent his voice to characters in several episodes of the Adult Swim cartoon &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; (see Musician cameos in &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; for more). The original character design for Pickles the Drummer, one of the series&#x27; main characters, bore a striking resemblance to Townsend. The series&#x27; co-creator Brendon Small acknowledged the similarity, and altered the design before the series began. &quot;We made sure he didn&#x27;t look like Devin Townsend. We gave him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldn&#x27;t look like that.&quot; 

===Creation of the Devin Townsend Project (2008–2012)===

After removing himself from the music industry, Townsend cut his trademark hair off and gave up drinking and smoking. Townsend found it &quot;disconcerting&quot; that he had difficulty writing music without drugs, and that he had trouble identifying his purpose as a musician. He spent a year producing albums in absence of writing, but found it unrewarding and decided to &quot;pick up the guitar and just write&quot;. This began a period of &quot;self discovery&quot; where he learned &quot;how to create without drugs&quot;.

Over two years, Townsend wrote over 60 songs, and found that they fit into &quot;four distinct styles&quot;. In March 2009, Townsend announced his plans for a four-album series called Devin Townsend Project, with the goal of clarifying his musical identity and being &quot;accountable&quot; for the persona he projects to the public. The project&#x27;s concept includes a different &quot;theme&quot; and a different group of musicians on each album.

&quot;Ki&quot;, the first album of the Devin Townsend Project tetralogy was written to &quot;set the stage&quot; for the subsequent albums. Townsend channelled his new-found control and sobriety into &quot;Ki&quot;, a &quot;tense, quiet&quot; album, which contrasts with much of the music he had been known for. Additional female vocals were provided by Ché Aimee Dorval (Casualties of Cool). &quot;Ki&quot; was released in May 2009. 
The second entry, a &quot;commercial, yet heavy&quot; album called &quot;Addicted&quot;, was released in November 2009 and features lead vocals from Townsend and Dutch singer Anneke van Giersbergen. Brian &quot;Beav&quot; Waddell was recruited from the Devin Townsend Band to play bass.

Townsend returned to the stage in January 2010, touring North America with headliner Between the Buried and Me as well as Cynic and Scale the Summit. This was followed by a headlining tour in Australia and a series of high-profile shows in Europe (for example co-headlining the Brutal Assault festival in Czech Republic). He headlined a North American tour with UK label mates TesseracT supporting, which began in October 2010, and toured in Europe with support from Aeon Zen and Anneke van Giersbergen.

The third and fourth albums in the Devin Townsend Project series, &quot;Deconstruction&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;, were released simultaneously on June 21, 2011. In December 2011 all four Devin Townsend Project albums with additional material were released as the &quot;Contain Us&quot; box set. Townsend performed all four of Devin Townsend Project albums in London and recorded them for a DVD box set called &quot;By a Thread: Live in London 2011&quot; that was released on June 18, 2012. The first three shows were held at the University of London Union, November 10–12, 2011. &quot;Ki&quot;, &quot;Addicted&quot;, and &quot;Deconstruction&quot; were each performed on one night, respectively. The show for &quot;Ghost&quot; was held at the Union Chapel, Islington on November 13, 2011. These four shows were each entitled &quot;An Evening with the Devin Townsend Project&quot;.

Despite the Devin Townsend Project being originally a four-album series, Townsend decided to continue working under the moniker and released the fifth album, &quot;Epicloud&quot; on September 18, 2012. Again featuring Anneke van Giersbergen on vocals, &quot;Epicloud&quot; appeared on several European charts, peaking at number 8 in Finland. On October 27, 2012, Townsend performed a one-off show covering his musical career called &quot;The Retinal Circus&quot; at Roundhouse in London. The 3-hour performance was recorded in high definition and released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 30, 2013. Also in 2012, Townsend played bass on the debut Bent Sea album &quot;Noistalgia&quot;. He also produced the record.

Another project Townsend has mentioned several times between 2009 and 2012 is &quot;Obviouser&quot;, an album featuring &quot;creepy, bass driven apocalyptic music&quot; created with an &quot;Ampeg rig&quot; and an &quot;Icelandic choir&quot;. Working with many projects simultaneously at that time, Townsend stated in 2012 the &quot;Obviouser&quot; project is vying for pole position until &quot;he wakes up and says &#x27;he wants to do it&#x27;&quot;.

===&quot;Casualties of Cool&quot; and &quot;Z2&quot; (2012–2014)===

After &quot;Deconstruction&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;, Townsend announced a new album, &quot;Casualties of Cool&quot;, with which he started to work after the release of &quot;Epicloud&quot;. The album features Ché Aimee Dorval (from &quot;Ki&quot;) on vocals and Morgan Ågren on drums. Townsend described the album sounds like &quot;haunted Johnny Cash songs&quot; and &quot;late night music&quot;, highlighting it will be different than anything he has done before. Townsend referred the music of the album to be &quot;closest to his heart&quot; at this point of his life, and that it is an important and satisfying project he does not want to rush.

The album was completed in November 2013, and a bonus disc was also made for the album, containing the leftover material from the main album as well as songs from &quot;Ghost 2&quot;, the unreleased compilation of leftover tracks from &quot;Ghost&quot;. Originally in 2012, Townsend stated that this album will be the sixth and the last album in the Devin Townsend Project series, but he ultimately confirmed that Casualties of Cool is its own project. Townsend also started a crowdfunding campaign through PledgeMusic to support the release of the album. The funding quickly reached its goal, and all additional funds were put directly to Townsend&#x27;s upcoming projects. &quot;Casualties of Cool&quot; was released on May 14, 2014. The album was re-issued worldwide on January 15, 2016, containing an additional DVD with live footage from the 2014 concert at the Union Chapel in London.

From 2009, Townsend worked on a long-running album project called &quot;Z2&quot;, a sequel to the album &quot;Ziltoid the Omniscient&quot; (2007). Originally in 2012, he teased he &quot;may have just written the heaviest thing (he&#x27;s) ever done&quot; for the album, and stated there might a surprising lack of Ziltoid himself appearing on the album. However, in August 2013, a London-based radio station, TeamRock Radio, aired the first episode of &quot;Ziltoid Radio&quot;, a satirical radio show hosted solely by Ziltoid, this being one element of the &quot;Z2&quot; project. Townsend also discussed a &quot;ZTV&quot; or &quot;Ziltoid TV&quot; to precede the album. Townsend later stated he found the project hard to schedule and work with amidst touring and writing, stating &quot;it takes a lot of effort&quot; to keep the content and its tongue-in-cheek humour entertaining.

After writing ideas for over 70 songs, Townsend stated he would finally finish the whole project, followed by the announcement the album would be released on October 27, 2014. The recording process started in May 2014, and the final project includes the album, a Ziltoid TV program and a live show, with a &quot;big graphic novel comic&quot; and a documentary. The album itself is a double album, with disc one featuring Devin Townsend Project material and disc two containing the main album. According to Townsend, the album&#x27;s theme is &quot;Ziltoid against the world&quot;. The Devin Townsend Project disc is called &quot;Sky Blue&quot; and the Ziltoid disc is called &quot;Dark Matters&quot;.

After finishing the album, Townsend stated the project was &quot;punishing&quot; and an &quot;absolute nightmare to complete&quot; due to amount of material against tight schedules. He also described the hardship of the project by telling &quot;if he was ever going to start drinking [again], the last months would have been it&quot;, but now &quot;he&#x27;s starting to get excited again&quot;. Later, &quot;after the chaos of finishing it had subsided&quot;, Townsend stated he is really satisfied with the result.

Townsend recently discussed at least a year-long hiatus, beginning after the Z2 show taking place at the Royal Albert Hall on April 13, 2015. During the indefinitely long break Townsend intends to &quot;recharge his batteries&quot;, &quot;get some inspiration and experiences&quot; and to &quot;see what the next chapter holds&quot; for him.

===&quot;Transcendence&quot; (2014–2017)===

In 2014, Townsend recorded a poppy-sounding song in Los Angeles with producer Brian Howes, but has decided against releasing. Townsend mentioned that he is against the project being contrived due to the current hard rock undertones in popular music. He described it as a &quot;lukewarm heavy metal Devin song&quot;. On December 11, 2015, Townsend announced via Twitter that he was recording vocals for a song by Steve Vai.

In early 2016, Townsend completed the seventh DTP album, entitled &quot;Transcendence&quot; at Armoury Studios in Vancouver. The album was released on September 9. On March 17, 2017, Devin Townsend Project played Ocean Machine live in its entirety at Hammersmith Apollo. On October 30, 2017, Devin announced that he was working on four new albums.

=== Break from Devin Townsend Project, &quot;Empath&quot; (2018–2020) ===
On January 31, 2018, Townsend announced on his Facebook page that he was taking a break from the Devin Townsend Project and focusing on a number of other projects, including the four new albums previously announced.

On January 15, 2019, Townsend announced his album, &quot;Empath&quot;, on which work had been completed, and slated for release on March 29, 2019. The album&#x27;s purpose is &quot;to see what would happen if all the styles that make up [Townsend&#x27;s] current interests were finally represented in one place.&quot;, and about &quot;allowing the audience a feeling for a variety of musical emotions. The musical dynamics represented on this single album are broad, challenging, and immense. To approach this sort of work with a long history of what makes heavy music &#x27;heavy&#x27;, allows this to be done with a type of power rarely heard.&quot; Guests on the album include former Frank Zappa collaborators Mike Keneally, Morgan Ågren and Steve Vai, as well as Samus Paulicelli, Chad Kroeger, Anneke Van Giersbergen, Ché Aimee Dorval from &quot;Casualties of Cool&quot;, and Ryan Dahle. A series of documentary videos detailing the making of Empath has been released on YouTube. He appeared on the YouTube show &quot;Tuesday Talks&quot; hosted by Mary Spender.

On March 12, 2020, Townsend postponed the remainder of his Empath Vol. 1 North American Tour due to the coronavirus pandemic. Four days later, on March 16, 2020, Townsend launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover the costs of the canceled tour. It raised $80,804 of the $50,000 goal. As a &quot;thank you&quot; to his fans, Townsend launched what he dubbed &quot;Quarantine Project&quot;, releasing new music in the process. Among the new tracks is a new mix of &quot;A New Reign&quot; from the &quot;Sky Blue&quot; album. Townsend collaborated with the likes of Kat Epple, Samus Paulicelli, Morgan Ågren, Federico Paulovich, Ché Aimee Dorval, Mattias Eklundh, Wes Hauch and Liam Wilson.

=== &quot;The Puzzle, Snuggles and Lightwork&quot; (2020–2023) ===
In April 2020, Townsend began uploading a chronological series of podcasts on his official YouTube channel, with each episode discussing one or two of the albums in his discography. These podcasts have been monologue discussions and reflections on the albums themselves, the influences, the personnel, and the state of Townsend&#x27;s life during the times these albums were being written and recorded.

In August 2020, Townsend announced the upcoming release of &quot;Empath Live Volume 1: Order of Magnitude&quot;, a live concert recorded during the first Empath Tour, and &quot;Empath Live Volume 2: By Request&quot;, a virtual concert for fans in lieu of the second tour, which was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 5, he hosted a streaming premiere of &quot;Empath Live Volume 2&quot;, a prerecorded virtual show featuring Samus Paulicelli on drums, Wes Hauch on guitar, Liam Wilson on bass, and Townsend on guitar and vocals. Each of them performed separately in front of green screens, with eight different camera setups each, to enhance the virtual concert experience. In 2021, he released two live albums: &quot;Devolution Series #1 - Acoustically Inclined, Live in Leeds&quot;, which was a recording of an acoustic show in Leeds in 2019, released on March 19 and &quot;Devolution Series #2 – Galactic Quarantine&quot; which was a recording of the aforementioned virtual show, released on June 25.

Townsend&#x27;s next project was a double release including the albums &quot;The Puzzle&quot; and &quot;Snuggles&quot;. The two albums were released on 3 December 2021, after two release delays &quot;due to a massive shortage in raw materials and plastics, preventing the physical releases, particularly the boxsets and vinyls, from getting completed and shipped out in time.&quot;. &quot;The Puzzle&quot; is based on the chaotic experience of the 2020 pandemic while &quot;Snuggles&quot; is said to be more calm; both albums are &quot;collaborative multimedia art projects&quot; accompanied by films and, in the case of &quot;The Puzzle&quot;, a graphic novel. These were followed by another solo album in 2022 called &quot;Lightwork&quot;. A tour in support of &quot;Lightwork&quot; was announced with dates in April–May 2022. Ultimately, Townsend cancelled his solo tour dates in favour of opening for American progressive metal band Dream Theater&#x27;s European Tour in early 2022. with his Lightwork tour being postponed until early 2023.

On October 16, 2023, via Inside Out Music&#x27;s YouTube channel, Townsend announced a new podcast series by publishing its first episode. The podcast was to be published monthly via the same channel. Based on the first episode, as well as Townsend&#x27;s Instagram, the new series&#x27; aim was, as opposed to the original Devin Townsend Podcast series (published on Townsend&#x27;s YouTube channel), not to analyze his past records, but rather to &#x27;focus on a real time observation of the next ones.&#x27;. 

=== &quot;PowerNerd&quot; (2023–present) ===
On August 23, a new song and video was released called &quot;PowerNerd&quot;, which was included on a new studio album of the same name that was released on October 25, 2024. He is currently working on a number of other projects, including ones codenamed &quot;The Moth&quot;, &quot;Axolotl&quot;, and a web series called &quot;Ruby Quaker&quot;.

==Personal life==
Townsend is married to Tracy Turner, whom he began dating when he was 19. She gave birth to their first son in October 2006. Townsend and his family live in the Vancouver suburb of Coquitlam.

Townsend has been a vegetarian for ethical reasons since around the early 1990s, but does not consider himself an activist. He has revealed in interviews that he suffers from depression. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around 1998, a condition that was unknowingly exacerbated by his alcohol and drug use at the time; he has been sober and free of anti-psychotic medication since 2007.

==Musical style==
===Projects===

Townsend designed his two main projects, the aggressive Strapping Young Lad and his more melodic solo material, as counterparts. Strapping Young Lad&#x27;s music was a diverse mix of extreme metal genres: death metal, thrash metal, black metal and industrial metal. Townsend&#x27;s solo material blends many genres and influences, with elements of atmospheric ambient music, hard rock and prog rock, along with glam metal and arena rock. He described it as &quot;a highly orchestrated type of expansive music based in hard rock and heavy metal. Dense and produced with a large amount of ambient elements.&quot; Despite Strapping Young Lad&#x27;s greater mainstream acceptance, Townsend identifies more with his solo material, and has never intended Strapping Young Lad to be the focus of his music.

===Production style===
Townsend is synesthetic, experiencing musical notes as colors and shapes. Partly due to this, he simultaneously composes and mixes his music in what he describes as &quot;all autopilot&quot;, practically without any deliberate application of music theory. As a self-proclaimed &quot;fan of multitracking&quot;, Townsend has developed a trademark production style featuring an atmospheric, layered &quot;wall of sound&quot;. Townsend has drawn critical praise for his productions, which &quot;are always marked by a sense of adventure, intrigue, chaotic atmospherics and overall aural pyrotechnics&quot;, according to Mike G. of &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot;. Townsend mainly uses Pro Tools to produce his music, alongside other software suites such as Steinberg Cubase, Ableton Live, Logic Pro and Waves Audio plugins. Townsend&#x27;s musical ideas and production style have drawn comparisons to Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. Townsend has carried out the mixing and mastering for most of his solo work himself.

Townsend has also mixed and remixed work for other artists such as Rammstein, August Burns Red and Misery Signals. In 2024 he co-produced the album &quot;II: Frailty&quot; by the Chinese progressive metal band OU.

===Playing style===
Townsend mainly uses Open C tuning for both six and seven string guitar. He now also uses Open B tuning and Open B flat tuning on his six string guitars. Townsend&#x27;s technique varies from fingerpicking, power chords and polychords to sweep-picked arpeggios and tapping techniques. He is also known for his heavy use of reverb and delay effects. He has expressed that he has no taste for shred guitar, saying that &quot;Musically it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me&quot; and that he only solos when he thinks that he can within the context of the song.

=== Vocals ===
Townsend employs a variety of vocal techniques in his work, including screaming, growling or even falsetto. Daniel Lake of &quot;Decibel Magazine&quot; classifies Townsend&#x27;s voice as a &quot;semi-operatic tenor&quot;.

===Influences===
Townsend draws influence from a wide range of music genres, most prominently heavy metal. Townsend has cited, among others, Judas Priest, W.A.S.P., Broadway musicals, ABBA, new-age music, Zoviet France, King&#x27;s X, Morbid Angel, Barkmarket, Grotus, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Fear Factory and Godflesh as his influences, and has also expressed his admiration for Meshuggah on several occasions, calling them &quot;the best metal band on the planet&quot;. Townsend lists Paul Horn and Ravi Shankar as the &quot;two most important musicians in his life&quot;. The two songs that Townsend credits with changing the way he thought about music are &quot;The Burning Down&quot; by King&#x27;s X, and &quot;Up the Beach&quot; by Jane&#x27;s Addiction. &quot;City&quot; was influenced by New York noise rock bands such as Foetus and Cop Shoot Cop, and &quot;The New Black&quot;&#x27;s influences were Meshuggah, and &quot;more traditional metal&quot; like Metallica. He is also influenced by orchestral and classical composers such as John Williams, Trevor Jones and Igor Stravinsky.

==Equipment==

Townsend played ESP six and seven-string guitars from 1994 to 2009 during his endorsement with ESP. In the early days of Strapping Young Lad, he was seen playing an ESP Flying V-style 6-string with a single EMG 81 pickup and a custom graphic designed by Townsend. This was the guitar that was used during the shows in support of Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, and the shows in support of City. In addition to this guitar, Townsend also utilized an ESP EXP Explorer-style guitar with two EMG 81 pickups. During the late 1990s and the 2000s, he was also seen with two ESP Telecaster models (one white, one black) with EMG 81 pickups, which were used for the majority of his six-string material. Townsend also utilized two ESP Custom Shop Horizon 7-string guitars with a 27&quot; baritone scale and EMG 81-7 pickups, which closely resembled ESP&#x27;s Stephen Carpenter signature model. He has also been seen with the Stephen Carpenter SC-607 and SC-607B. He was also occasionally seen playing what is believed to be a Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster HSS during Accelerated Evolution and Synchestra-era shows (mainly for performing &quot;Deadhead&quot;). At the time, this was the only guitar Devin Townsend was seen with that did not have EMG pickups, but was modified with a Seymour Duncan STK-S2n Hot Stack in the neck.
After returning to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey, and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup in the neck position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit (for Open C and Open B tuning, respectively).
In 2012, Townsend announced that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: &quot;The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can&#x27;t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V&#x27;s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand.&quot;
For Strapping Young Lad and solo projects from 1996 – 2004, Townsend mainly used the Peavey 5150 head, with Mesa/Boogie and Marshall 4x12 cabinets, for his main sounds. Around 2005, Townsend began to utilize Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier and Stiletto amp heads, boosted with a Maxon OD808, running into Mesa/Boogie 2x12 cabinets, and Marshall 4x12 cabinets. He would also run a 3rd signal into a 1990s Roland GP-100, which would be amplified by a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp. He would still make use of the Peavey head for some solo recordings, such as Synchestra. He switched to a Fractal Audio AxeFx system in 2010, replacing his entire Mesa/Boogie and Marshall rig. He has been through a number of outboard modules that were mainly used for echo/reverb effects, something that Townsend is known for as a part of his signature sound. One of his favorites is the Roland GP-100, a unit that Townsend still uses along with his Fractal units. He also used a TC Electronic G-Force in tandem with his Mesa/Boogie rig. Townsend also utilizes D&#x27;Addario Strings (.010-.052 and .010-.060) and Planet Waves Custom Series cables.
As of 2014, he reintroduced the Dual Rectifier into his rig using a wet-dry-wet setup with the Dual Rectifier being the center dry sound and the AxeFx being the stereo effected sounds using the model of the Dual Rectifier as a basis. In 2015, for live shows, the Dual Rectifier was replaced with a Kemper Profiler Amplifier, and the Roland GP-100 was retired in favor of effects in the Fractal Axe-FX.
At the 2016 NAMM Show, Townsend introduced a signature set of Fishman pickups in the Fluence line and a signature Framus guitar that features an original body shapes, the Fishman pickups and the Evertune Bridge.

In November 2017, Townsend posted to social media and forums that his equipment list had been reduced, explaining how he had eliminated a number of pieces of equipment from his setup. He wrote, &quot;I was working with many amp companies, but I have made my choice and have settled on a single Axe Fx 2XL+ for my ENTIRE chain. I use Framus Guitars, Fishman Pickups, 
D&#x27;Addario strings, Fractal Axe Fx. One Rig to rule them all =)&quot;

In 2018 Mooer released the Devin Townsend signature Ocean Machine pedal, featuring twin delays, reverb and looper with infinite feedback in a genuine collaboration which Townsend enthusiastically recommended. The relatively unusual pedal design was received well, with 5 star reviews.

In 2023, Devin paired with guitar pick maker Acoustik Attak to release his signature Devin Townsend &quot;Earthtone&quot; pick.

<doc id="426749" wikidata="Q164945" url="?curid=426749" title="Adjusted present value">
<text>Adjusted present value (APV) is a valuation method introduced in 1974 by Stewart Myers. The idea is to value the project as if it were all equity financed (&quot;unleveraged&quot;), and to then add the present value of the tax shield of debt – and other side effects.

Technically, an APV valuation model looks similar to a standard DCF model. However, instead of WACC, cash flows would be discounted at the unlevered cost of equity, and tax shields at either the cost of debt (Myers) or following later academics also with the unlevered cost of equity. APV and the standard DCF approaches should give the identical result if the capital structure remains stable.

According to Myers, the value of the levered firm (Value levered, Vl) is equal to the value of the firm with no debt (Value unlevered, Vu) plus the present value of the tax savings due to the tax deductibility of interest payments, the so-called value of the tax shield (VTS). Myers proposes calculating the VTS by discounting the tax savings at the cost of debt (Kd). The argument is that the risk of the tax saving arising from the use of debt is the same as the risk of the debt.

The method is to calculate the NPV of the project as if it is all-equity financed (so called &quot;base case&quot;). Then the base-case NPV is adjusted for the benefits of financing. Usually, the main benefit is a tax shield resulted from tax deductibility of interest payments. Another benefit can be a subsidized borrowing at sub-market rates. The APV method is especially effective when a leveraged buyout case is considered since the company is loaded with an extreme amount of debt, so the tax shield is substantial.

<doc id="426754" wikidata="Q158736" url="?curid=426754" title="Volkswagen Phaeton">
<text>The Volkswagen Phaeton ( ) (&quot;Typ&quot; 3D) is a full-size sedan/saloon manufactured by the German automobile manufacturer Volkswagen, described by Volkswagen as their &quot;premium class&quot; vehicle. Introduced at the 2002 Geneva Motor Show, the Phaeton was marketed worldwide. Sales in North America ended in 2006 and global sales ended in 2016.

The name Phaeton derives from Phaëton, the son of Phoebus (or Helios) in Greek mythology, by way of the phaeton auto body style and the type of horse-drawn carriage that preceded it.

Production ended in March 2016 and an all-electric second generation was slated to be produced. Starting in April 2017, the Transparent Factory Dresden began assembling the e-Golf instead.

==First and second series (2002) (GP0/GP1)==
===Development===
The Phaeton was conceived by Ferdinand Piëch, then chairman of Volkswagen Group, who wanted a car that would surpass the German prestige market leaders, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, in part as a response to Mercedes&#x27; and BMW&#x27;s decision to compete in Europe directly with Volkswagen by introducing the A-Class and BMW 3 Series Compact. It was officially revealed at the 2002 Geneva International Motor Show.

Although the Volkswagen Group already had a direct competitor in the full sized luxury segment, the Audi A8, the Phaeton was intended to be more of a comfort-oriented limousine, like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS, whereas the Audi A8 and BMW 7 Series are more performance-oriented. Piëch also wanted to move the VW brand upmarket, with the Phaeton serving as the brand&#x27;s flagship model.

Initial development of the Phaeton, given the internal project code VW611, began with Piëch giving his engineers a list of ten parameters the car needed to fulfill. Most of these specifications were not made known to the public, but a number of them were told to automotive reporters.

One of them was that the Phaeton should be capable of being driven all day at with an exterior temperature of whilst maintaining an interior temperature of . Piëch requested this even though the Phaeton&#x27;s top speed was electronically limited to . Other requirements were that the car should have a torsional rigidity of 37,000 N·m/degree, and that the electric motors that perform various functions in the vehicle be hidden for a cleaner look.

At the 1999 International Motor Show Germany, Volkswagen presented the Concept D, which was essentially a hatchback prototype of the Phaeton, with very similar design, V10 TDI engine, air suspension and all wheel drive.

===Overview===
The Phaeton used a special version of the Volkswagen D platform, designated D1. The D1 variant was shared with the Bentley Continental GT and Bentley Flying Spur, and was differentiated from the other D platform model, the Audi A8, by using all-steel construction, whereas the A8 continued to use the all-aluminum &quot;Audi Space Frame&quot; chassis. Certain systems, such as the automatic transmission and some engines, are shared with the A8.

Compared to the Audi A8L 4.2 litre FSI quattro, the Phaeton is heavier but is still competitive with the lighter A8 in most driving tests, due to the Phaeton&#x27;s increased engine power (335 hp versus 330) and a shorter axle ratio (3.65:1 versus 3.32). However, the weight gives the Phaeton considerably worse acceleration and poorer fuel economy compared to the A8.

The Phaeton had the longest wheelbase in the Volkswagen passenger car line.

===Features===
Development of the vehicle led to over one hundred individual patents specific to the Phaeton. Distinctive features include a draftless four zone climate system and standard Torsen based 4motion four-wheel drive.

For high ride comfort, it introduced Adaptive Air Suspension with Continuous Damping Control (CDC)-(Skyhook suspension). The same suspension system, with firmer settings, was introduced in the technically similar Audi A8 in November 2002.

The Phaeton was the first Volkswagen with radar adaptive cruise control: automatic distance regulator (ADR). Additionally, the 5.0 L V10 TDI engine option in Phaeton marked the first ever use of a V10 engine in a production sedan. 

===Phaeton Lounge (2005)===
The Phaeton Lounge was a concept car based on a lengthened version of the Phaeton with seating for four (two pairs of seats facing each other) in the rear compartment. It features a W12 engine, a reinforced chassis, six speed Tiptronic automatic transmission, individual climate control for each passenger, front and rear wine coolers, a minibar, multi color mood lighting, a cigar humidor, two 17 inch monitors, DVD changer in the trunk, second DVD player in the rear cabin, and a Bluetooth enabled computer with a broadband connection.

The vehicle was unveiled in 2005 Middle East International Motor Show.

===Production===
The Phaeton was hand assembled in an eco friendly factory with a glass exterior, the Transparent Factory () in Dresden, Germany. This factory had a capacity of producing 20,000 vehicles a year, and was planned to expand to 35,000 vehicles a year. It also assembled Bentley Flying Spur vehicles destined for the European market until October 2006, when all assembly of the Bentley products was transferred to Crewe, England.

The Phaeton body was fabricated and painted at the Volkswagen works at Zwickau, Germany, and the completed bodies were transported approximately 100 km by special road transport vehicles to the main factory. Most Phaeton engines, the W12 being the notable exception, were built at the VW/Porsche/Audi engine plant in Győr, Hungary.

===Reception and sales===
Sales of the Phaeton fell far short of expectations. Its biggest market was China, followed by South Korea.

In 2002, the manufacturer stated the annual capacity of the new Phaeton plant at Dresden was 20,000; by September 2006 a four-year total of 25,000 had been built, with production running at approximately 6,000 cars annually. The domestic market was the Phaeton&#x27;s strongest, with 19,314 Phaetons delivered in Germany alone by January 2009. Production decreased to 10,190 cars in 2012 and 5,812 in 2013. In Phaeton&#x27;s production run that lasted 15 years, 84,253 units were built.

In Canada, 93 Phaetons were sold in 2004, and in the first eight months of 2005, only 21 found owners. In the United States market, 1,433 Phaetons were sold in 2004, and 820 were sold in 2005, leading the company to announce that sales in the North American market would end after the 2006 model year. The W12 engined models have depreciated significantly, and sell for a small fraction of their original cost.

The Phaeton debuted at prices comparable to similar offerings from Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus and the Volkswagen Group&#x27;s own Audi A8 (which shared its powertrain with the Phaeton). &quot;Motor Trend&quot; suggested that the &quot;VW badge on the hood may not say &#x27;premium&#x27; to many auto shoppers&quot; but they were impressed at how the Phaeton drove.

In January 2011, Volkswagen reported the possibility of bringing the Phaeton back to the United States in the car&#x27;s next product cycle. In Autumn 2013, &quot;The Economist&quot; placed Phaeton into the report on Europe&#x27;s biggest loss making cars. In October 2014, &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; placed the Phaeton on its list of &quot;The worst cars you can buy right now.&quot;

In 2008, Volkswagen released the first update to the Phaeton. Subtle design changes were made by the introduction of chrome fog light covers and cherry red rear lights. The CD-based navigation system was upgraded to a DVD system, and the 3.0 V6 TDI engine had its power increased from 222 to 230bhp.

The German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder chose Phaeton to be his official state car in his second term from 2002 to 2005. The reason is widely thought to be that before becoming chancellor, he previously served as the Minister-President of Lower Saxony in 1990–1998, where Volkswagen is headquartered in the city of Wolfsburg and is a major employer in the state, also Lower Saxony state government owns several shares in Volkswagen AG.

==Third series (2008) (GP2)==
The vehicle was unveiled at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show.

Update included new LED daytime running lights, as well as a freshened centre console with revamped controls and materials. New Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) V6 petrol engine with greater power and fuel efficiency (206 kW / 280 PS) which satisfy Euro-5 emissions standards is also available.

Other changes to the car for 2009 included: three new types of alloy wheels (17, 18 and 19 inch), a slightly modified radiator grille, three new exterior colours, the new leather colour, the new wood trims, white switch illumination instead of red, accent and switch trim in the new &quot;Warm gray&quot; colour, an upgraded car key, makeup mirror in the rear on the LWB version, dampers optimised for low-friction, Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite brakes (front) on the Phaeton W12, as well as a rearview camera (Rear Assist) and blind spot warning system Side Assist.

==Fourth series (2011) (GP3)==
The vehicle was unveiled in the 2010 Beijing International Automotive Exhibition.

The car for 2011 got a new front fascia to more closely resemble the Volkswagen styling direction first seen on the Golf Mk VI. This included new LED running lights, bi-xenon headlights and a new bumper with LED fog lights. The rear LED clusters were altered to mimic those found on facelifted Touran, Sharan, the new Touareg and the new Passat.

The interior benefited from some new technologies, but retained the 2009 MY layout. The Phaeton was offered in two wheelbase lengths (standard and long) and two seating layouts (standard five seats and optional four seats with full centre console). In the five-seat version, the front seats can be adjusted 12 ways. Standard features include all wheel drive, air suspension, and four zone automatic climate control. A multifunction steering wheel can be ordered in leather or wood leather.

The W12 engine option was deleted from the European and international markets except China where it was still offered until the end of Phaeton production in 2016.

==Fifth series (2014) (GP4)==
A further, minor facelift was introduced in 2014, including exterior alterations to the front fog lights and darkened rear lights. The interior was also updated including a new gear lever, gloss black accents around the gear lever and steering controls and the introduction of a new removable touch screen remote for rear passengers.

===New technologies===
*Automatic Distance Control adaptive cruise control with new Stop&amp;Go function
*Front Assist collision avoidance system
*Dynamic Light Assist non-glare highbeam
*Traffic sign recognition that can also detect overtaking restrictions
*GPS-Navigation with Google Earth
*3G Mobile internet (UMTS)

===Transmissions===

==Second generation==
Before the Phaeton was discontinued in 2016, development of the second generation had already begun, with a near-production prototype already completed, which Volkswagen revealed in 2022.

==Powertrain==
, powertrain options for the Phaeton included the following engines. 4motion permanent four-wheel drive was the only driveline system available, except for the 2003 and 2004 model years when front wheel drive was available with the 3.2 litre engine. 

Vehicles manufactured for sale in the North American market were only available with the 4.2 litre V8 and 6.0 litre W12 engine, both of which were electronically limited to .

The Phaeton features a Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, with Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Anti-Slip Regulation (ASR) traction control system, Electronic Differential Lock (EDL), Engine Braking Control (EBC), with emergency Brake Assist (BA).

The electronic differential lock (EDL) employed by Volkswagen is not, as the name suggests, a differential lock at all. Sensors monitor wheel speeds across an individual driven axle, and if one wheel is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e. slipping) the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers power to the other wheel.

Volkswagen was developing an electric version, but replaced it with their MEB2 platform for 2020.

<text>Robert Guy Talamini (January 8, 1939 – May 30, 2022) was an American professional football player who was a guard in the American Football League (AFL). He played college football for the Kentucky Wildcats, earning third-team All-SEC honors. He was selected by the Houston Oilers of the American Football League (AFL). His professional career began with the AFL&#x27;s first training camp in 1960, and was capped the day the New York Jets stunned the NFL&#x27;s Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III on January 12, 1969.
Hall of Famers George Blanda and Billy Cannon benefited from his blocking as the Oilers won the first two AFL Championships. Talamini made first-team All-AFL in 1962 and was a regular at AFL All-Star games, selected to six straight, through 1967. He anchored an offensive line that gave Blanda time to set passing records that would last for decades and opened holes for the likes of Cannon, Charlie Tolar, Sid Blanks and Hoyle Granger to run through. Talamini, Don Floyd and Jim Norton were the last of the original Oilers.

After two AFL crowns and three Eastern Division titles, Talamini watched the club rebuild and win the division again in 1967. The Oilers fell one game short in 1967, but Talamini got to realize his dream the following year when he was released and picked up by the New York Jets. Opening holes for Matt Snell and blocking defenders away from Joe Namath. Talamini was selected to the All-Time All-AFL second-team.

In 2011, he was inducted in the Kentucky Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Talamini died on May 30, 2022, at the age of 83.

<text>Wet Hot American Summer is a 2001 American satirical comedy film directed by David Wain from a screenplay written by Wain and Michael Showalter. The film features an ensemble cast, with Janeane Garofalo and David Hyde Pierce starring alongside Molly Shannon, Paul Rudd, Christopher Meloni, Showalter (and various other members of the sketch comedy group The State), Marguerite Moreau, Ken Marino, Michael Ian Black, Zak Orth, A. D. Miles, Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper (in his film debut), Marisa Ryan, Kevin Sussman, Joe Lo Truglio, and Elizabeth Banks. It takes place during the last full day at a fictional summer camp in 1981, and spoofs the sex comedies aimed at teen audiences of that era.

The film was a critical and commercial failure, but has since developed a cult following, and many of its cast members have gone on to high-profile work. Netflix revived the franchise with the release of an eight-episode prequel series starring most of the film&#x27;s original cast, on July 31, 2015; and an eight-episode sequel series, set ten years after the original film, on August 4, 2017.

==Plot==
The film shows the last full day of a 1981 summer camp named Camp Firewood, located near Waterville, Maine, concentrating on the experiences of the camp counselors, most of whom are students aged around 16. The interleaved story threads meet in the evening at the camp talent show:

Cook Gene, a Vietnam War veteran, clumsily tries to hide his various sexual fetishes. But after being encouraged by a talking can of vegetables, he proudly admits them all in front of the packed food hall, to great applause.

Zealous drama instructors Ben and Susie try to organize a talent show to be held on the last evening. Ben is in love with counselor McKinley. They have passionate sex and are later symbolically married by Beth in a ceremony by the lake. Beth forces Ben and Susie to give the last slot of their talent show to strange outsider Steve. He surprises everyone when during his time on stage an intense storm breaks out inside and outside the venue, seemingly created only with the power of Steve&#x27;s mind. He receives a wild ovation.

Counselor Coop is secretly in love with counselor Katie, but she is dating attractive but obnoxious and inconsiderate lifeguard Andy, who cheats on her, e.g. with counselor Lindsay. Katie has decided to find a girl for Coop and when they spend time together during the day, Katie develops feelings for him. Eventually they kiss, but Katie soon returns to Andy and tells Coop that they made a mistake. A devastated Coop is found by Gene, who performs a rigorous training regimen with him. A newly buff Coop impresses Katie at the talent show and she declares her love for him. But when both bid farewell the next morning, she explains that she has returned to Andy again, even though she knows he is a terrible boyfriend, because he is very attractive and she is only interested in sex at the moment, leaving Coop speechless.

Camp director Beth is attracted to Henry, an associate professor of astrophysics who vacations near the camp. She asks him to come over and teach the campers about space. After rudely rejecting her first, he changes his mind and does science projects with a group of nerdy children, bonding with them and getting closer to Beth, eventually sleeping with her. Henry and the children discover that a piece of Skylab will deorbit this evening and will probably impact the camp. They build a contraption to pinpoint the precise location: the talent show venue. Henry thinks he can modify the machine so that it can influence the path of the space debris. After he and the children use the modified machine near the talent show during the storm, the debris lands harmlessly on the grass.

Counselor Victor tries to give the impression that he has sexual experience, but is secretly a virgin. He is promised sex by the promiscuous Abby this night, but is told by Beth to go on a rafting trip with several campers and Neil. He abandons them at the river, steals the van and tries to return to Abby. He crashes the van, but reaches the camp on foot in the evening, where Abby has forgotten about him. When Neil and the children get lost on the river, Neil abandons them on the raft to look for Victor. He finds him at the camp and brings him back to the river, just in time to save the children.

Arts and crafts instructor Gail has a nervous breakdown during class. The children perform a group therapy session with her, during which she admits that she is not yet over her ex-husband Ron. With the help of the children, especially Aaron, she finally finds the courage to reject Ron when he arrives during the talent show and asks her to come back to him. The next morning, Gail and Aaron declare their love for each other.

==Production==
===Background===
The film is based on the experiences Wain had while attending Jewish camps, particularly Camp Wise in Claridon Township, Ohio and Camp Modin in Belgrade, Maine. Showalter also drew on his experiences he had at Camp Mohawk in the Berkshires in Cheshire, Massachusetts. During one scene, the counselors take a trip into Waterville, Maine, which is not far from the camp. It is also a parody of, and homage to, other films about summer camp, including &quot;Meatballs&quot; (1979), &quot;Little Darlings&quot; (1980), &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; (1983), and &quot;Indian Summer&quot; (1993). According to Wain, they wanted to make a film structured like the films &quot;Nashville&quot;, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; and &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;—&quot;films that take place in one contained time period that have lots of different characters.&quot;

===Development===
The film&#x27;s financing took three years to assemble; in a June 2011 interview, Wain revealed the film&#x27;s budget was $1.8 million; he noted that during the 2001 Sundance Film Festival, the film had been promoted as costing $5 million, in an attempt to attract a better offer from a distributor. Because of the film&#x27;s relatively small budget, the cast was paid very little; Paul Rudd has stated that he is uncertain that he received any compensation at all for the film.

===Filming===
Principal photography lasted 28 days in May 2000, and, according to director David Wain, it rained on every day of shooting. Exterior shots were filmed when possible, sometimes under covers or umbrellas, but some scenes were moved indoors instead. In many interior scenes, rain seen outside turns into sun as soon as characters step outside. Due to the cold, the actors&#x27; breath can be seen in some outdoor scenes. The film was shot at Camp Towanda in Honesdale, Pennsylvania.

===Music===
As the film is set in the early 1980s, the film&#x27;s soundtrack features songs from many popular bands of the era, most notably Jefferson Starship, Rick Springfield, Loverboy, and KISS.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot; premiered at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival, where it was screened four times to sold-out crowds, though it failed to attract a distributor. Months later, USA Films offered the filmmakers $100,000 for the film, with virtually no participation for the filmmakers, an offer the film&#x27;s investors accepted. It premiered in New York City on July 27, 2001, then received a limited theatrical release in fewer than 30 cities.

===Home media===
The film was released in both VHS and DVD formats on January 15, 2002 by USA Home Entertainment. In 2011, Wain tried to convince Universal Studios to prepare either a 10th anniversary home video re-release with extra features, or a Blu-ray release, but Universal rejected the ideas. The film was released on Blu-ray on May 12, 2015.

==Reception==
&quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot; received mostly negative reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 38%, based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 4.85/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot;″s incredibly talented cast is too often outmatched by a deeply silly script that misses its targets at least as often as it skewers them.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a score of 42 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert rated the film with one star out of four. His review took the form of a tongue-in-cheek parody of Allan Sherman&#x27;s &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot;.

In contrast, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Owen Gleiberman awarded the film an &quot;A&quot;, and named it as one of the ten best films of the year. &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s David Ansen also lauded it, calling it a &quot;gloriously silly romp&quot; that &quot;made me laugh harder than any other movie this summer. Make that this year.&quot; The film has gone on to achieve a cult following.

Actress Kristen Bell stated on NPR on September 2, 2012, that &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot; was her favorite film, having watched it &quot;hundreds of times.&quot; NPR host Jesse Thorn said on the April 29, 2014 episode of &quot;Bullseye&quot;: 

==Follow-ups==
The film is followed by two Netflix series, with one serving as a prequel and one as a sequel. The prequel, &quot;First Day of Camp&quot;, was released on July 31, 2015, while the sequel, &quot;Ten Years Later&quot;, was released on August 4, 2017.

==Legacy==
The professional wrestler Orange Cassidy, who has the gimmick of a slacker character, is largely based on Paul Rudd&#x27;s portrayal of Andy in the film, even going as far as to have &quot;Jane&quot; by Jefferson Starship (which is used in the film&#x27;s opening credits) as his entrance music.

===Anniversary celebrations===
Events were held around the country to celebrate the film&#x27;s 10-year anniversary in 2011 and 2012, including a screening of the film in Boston, an art show in Santa Monica of works inspired by the film, with a reception hosted by Wain, a screening at the Los Angeles Film School with a Q&amp;A with Wain, a 10th anniversary celebration event with the members of Stella in Brooklyn, and a reading of the script at the San Francisco Comedy Festival, with much of the original cast.

===Undeveloped TV series===
During a 2015 interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Wain and Showalter stated that they wrote a pilot for a possible Fox television series based on the film. Wain described the series as a &quot;22-minute Fox sitcom with commercials and nothing Rated R, so it was a little bit odd.&quot; The pilot was not picked up for a series.

===Documentary===
Alongside the prequel series, a making-of documentary, &quot;Hurricane of Fun: The Making of Wet Hot&quot;, was released on Netflix on July 24, 2015, consisting of behind-the-scenes interviews and footage shot during the filming of the movie.

<doc id="426767" wikidata="Q526950" url="?curid=426767" title="Blondie (comic strip)">
<text>Blondie is an American comic strip created by cartoonist Chic Young. The comic strip is distributed by King Features Syndicate, and has been published in newspapers since September 8, 1930. The success of the strip, which features the eponymous blonde and her sandwich-loving husband, led to the long-running &quot;Blondie&quot; film series (1938–1950) and the popular &quot;Blondie&quot; radio program (1939–1950).

Chic Young wrote and drew &quot;Blondie&quot; until his death in 1973, when creative control passed to his son Dean Young. A number of artists have assisted on drawing the strip over the years, including Alex Raymond, Jim Raymond, Paul Fung Jr., Mike Gersher, Stan Drake, Denis Lebrun, Jeff Parker, and (since 2005) John Marshall. Despite these changes, &quot;Blondie&quot; has remained popular, appearing in more than 2,000 newspapers in 47 countries and translated into 35 languages. From 2006 to 2013, &quot;Blondie&quot; was also available via email through King Features&#x27; DailyINK service.

==Overview==
Designed to follow in the footsteps of Young&#x27;s earlier &quot;pretty girl&quot; creations &quot;Beautiful Bab&quot; and &quot;Dumb Dora&quot;, &quot;Blondie&quot; focused on the adventures of Blondie Boopadoop—a carefree flapper girl who spent her days in dance halls along with her boyfriend Dagwood Bumstead, heir to an industrial fortune. The name &quot;Boopadoop&quot; derives from the scat singing lyric that was popularized by Helen Kane&#x27;s 1928 song &quot;I Wanna Be Loved by You&quot;.

Blondie and Dagwood debuted on September 8, 1930, in the &quot;New York American&quot; and several other newspapers across North America. The strip was only moderately popular in its first two and a half years, as interest in humorous &quot;pretty girl&quot; stories dried up as a result of the Great Depression, turning &quot;Blondie&quot; into a parody of those strips and taking a more melodramatic direction. In mid-1932, and considering the scenario to have run its course, Young briefly tried writing Dagwood out of the daily continuities by having his parents send him on a cruise to Europe and replacing him as Blondie&#x27;s boyfriend with a garage mechanic, but immediate reader response led to Dagwood returning by late August.

===Marriage===
On February 17, 1933, after much fanfare and build-up, Blondie and Dagwood were married. After a month-and-a-half-long hunger strike by Dagwood to get his parents&#x27; blessing, as they strongly disapproved of his marrying beneath his class, they disinherited him. Left only with a check to pay for their honeymoon, the Bumsteads were forced to become a middle-class suburban family. The marriage was a significant media event, given the comic strip&#x27;s popularity. The catalog for the University of Florida&#x27;s 2005 exhibition, &quot;75 Years of Blondie, 1930–2005&quot;, notes:
:Blondie&#x27;s marriage marked the beginning of a change in her personality. From that point forward, she gradually assumed her position as the sensible head of the Bumstead household. And Dagwood, who previously had been cast in the role of straight man to Blondie&#x27;s comic antics, took over as the comic strip&#x27;s clown.

===Setting===
&quot;Dagwood Bumstead and family, including Daisy and the pups, live in the suburbs of Joplin, Missouri,&quot; according to the August 1946 issue of &quot;The Joplin Globe&quot;, citing Chic Young.

===Cast of characters===
* Blondie Bumstead (&quot;née&quot; Boopadoop): The eponymous leading lady of the comic strip, Blondie is a smart, sweet, and responsible woman. She can be stressed at times due to her young family and Dagwood&#x27;s antics, and despite being usually laid-back and patient, Blondie does get upset sometimes. She is also extremely beautiful, with golden hair, gentle curls, and a shapely figure. A friend once told Dagwood that Blondie looked like a &#x27;million bucks&#x27;. In 1991, she began a catering business with her neighbor, Tootsie.
* Dagwood Bumstead: Blondie&#x27;s husband and a kind and loving, yet clumsy, naïve, and lazy man, his cartoonish antics are the basis for the strip. He is a big fan of sports (primarily football and baseball) and has a large, insatiable appetite for food (but he remains slender). Dagwood is especially fond of making and eating the towering Dagwood sandwich. He celebrates even the most insignificant holidays and approaches Thanksgiving (a holiday known for lavish dinners) with the same reverence most people reserve for Christmas. His continuous antagonistic and comical confrontations with his boss, Mr. Dithers, for numerous reasons including Dagwood&#x27;s laziness and silly mistakes, is a subplot that gets considerable attention in the strip. His klutziness is also a fundamental part of his encounters with Mr. Beasley the mailman. Another subplot deals with Dagwood and his neighbor Herb. Dagwood can also often be seen napping on his own couch. He is employed as the office manager at J. C. Dithers Construction Company.
* Alexander Bumstead: The elder child of Blondie and Dagwood, he is in his late teens, and was formerly referred to by his pet name &quot;Baby Dumpling&quot;. As a child, he was very mischievous and precocious. As a teenager, he is athletic, levelheaded, and intelligent. Despite resembling his father, he is more down-to-earth, like his mother. His full name, revealed in the November 7, 1934, strip, is Alexander Hamilton Bumstead. 
* Cookie Bumstead: The younger child of Blondie and Dagwood, she is in her early teens. Cookie is portrayed as a sweet, bubbly teenaged girl whose interests include dating, hanging out with friends, and clothes. Her appearance has changed the most compared to the other characters. As a child (1940s–mid 1950s), she originally had long, curly hair with a black bow holding a long curl on the top of her head. As a young teen (late 1950s–1960s), she wore her hair in a ponytail with curly bangs. As an older teen (1970s–1990s), she wore her hair long with a black headband. Later (2000s), she dropped the hairband and wore her hair with bangs and barrettes, and flipped to the sides. Her current hairstyle is long with bangs and flipped at sides.
* Daisy: The Bumsteads&#x27; family dog, whose best friend is Dagwood, frequently changes her expression in response to Dagwood&#x27;s comments or other activities. She gave birth to puppies in the later years of the comic. Daisy&#x27;s birthday is September 19.
* Mr. Beasley the Postman: He is the Bumsteads&#x27; mailman, with whom Dagwood seems to always collide and knock down as Dagwood hurriedly leaves the house. Variations on this gag are that once Alexander collided with Beasley and once the Bumsteads installed an outside mailbox-which Dagwood ran into instead of Mr Beasley. Beasley&#x27;s birthday is August 26.
* Mr. Julius Caesar Dithers: Founder of the J.C. Dithers Construction Company and Dagwood&#x27;s boss, he dictates orders to his employees and believes the best thing in life is money. Mr. Dithers has a very harsh personality and is portrayed as a difficult and controlling employer. He continuously denies Dagwood&#x27;s requests for a raise and frequently threatens to fire him. He always addresses Dagwood somewhat disrespectfully by using only his last name &quot;Bumstead&quot;. Although it usually does not seem like it at the workplace, Mr. Dithers is a good-hearted man. Despite the frequent disputes at work, Julius and Cora are frequent dinner guests at Dagwood&#x27;s home after work. On these occasions, the relationship is more cordial, with Mr. Dithers addressing Dagwood by his first name. A running gag for many years is that whenever Dagwood messes up an important contract Dithers will pick Dagwood up and either kick or throw him down the hallway. On the 75th anniversary of Blondie, Dithers became great friends with the visiting King of ID! Julius&#x27; birthday is July 2.
* Mrs. Cora Dithers: Mr. Dithers&#x27; wife, she usually gets into fights with him as she exerts control over him (she usually wins). She is great friends with Blondie.
* Herb Woodley: Dagwood&#x27;s best friend and next-door neighbor, Herb, though, can be extremely selfish and mean at times when he does not return the expensive power tools and favors that he usually borrows from Dagwood. Herb constantly finds means to annoy and infuriate him.
* Tootsie Woodley: Herb&#x27;s wife and Blondie&#x27;s best friend, Tootsie and Blondie can empathize with one another as women, mothers, and particularly as spouses of eccentric husbands. In 1991, she joined Blondie in starting a catering business.
* Elmo Tuttle: A kid in the neighborhood, he has a friendship with Dagwood (whom he calls &quot;Mr. B&quot;), but sometimes annoys him. His last name was originally &quot;Fiffenhauser&quot;. Replaced a similar character named Alvin Fuddle who was Baby Dumpling&#x27;s best friend through the 1940s.
* Lou: He is the owner and counterman at Lou&#x27;s Diner, where Dagwood goes for lunch. Dagwood sometimes suggests new specials for the diner. Lou&#x27;s arms are covered with tattoos (a heart and a Navy anchor) and he always has a toothpick in his mouth. His cooking skill is dubious and all his meals are of a quality that Blondie would never be party to -- rancid, over-spiced, or tasteless, and way too expensive. Lou does little to improve the quality of his food or to gain the satisfaction of his customers. Once when Lou closed the diner for a week so he could visit his mother in Hoboken, Dagwood suffered &quot;withdrawal pains&quot;.
* Claudia and Dwitzell: They are carpoolers with Dagwood and Herb. Claudia is a lawyer. No occupation has been identified for Dwitzell, sometimes called &quot;Dwitz&quot;.
* Mike Morelli the Barber: Dagwood&#x27;s barber, he likes to make fun of Dagwood&#x27;s hairstyle and can usually be seen with his nameplate, &quot;M. Morelli&quot;, displayed by his barber&#x27;s chair. Mike loves to lure and drag Dagwood into political debates at points where it usually leaves Dagwood frustrated.
* Marlene: Dithers&#x27; secretary.
* Alvin Fuddle: Baby Dumpling&#x27;s best friend, a mischievous boy who annoys the Bumsteads especially Dagwood. Only appeared from the 1930s to 1950s and plays a more prominent role in the Columbia film series. A similar character named Elmo Tuttle replaces his role.
* Maya: Blondie&#x27;s pastry chef, hired in 2024.

===Running gags===
Several running gags occur in &quot;Blondie&quot;, reflecting the trend after Chic Young&#x27;s death for the strip to focus almost entirely on Dagwood as the lead character:
* Dagwood often collides with Mr. Beasley the mailman while running out the front door—late for work.
* Other variations of the late-for-work gag: Dagwood keeping his car pool waiting, running after their car or stuck in traffic. In earlier decades, he had been late for the bus, or even earlier in the strip&#x27;s run, late for the streetcar.
* Dagwood&#x27;s impossible appetite for food:
** The impossibly tall sandwiches Dagwood fixes for himself, which came to be known colloquially as the &quot;Dagwood sandwich&quot;, became famous.
** Dagwood in his pajamas is having a midnight snack, with most of the refrigerator contents spread out on the kitchen table, or balanced precariously on his extended arms on the way to the table.
** At Lou&#x27;s Diner, whenever Lou&#x27;s cook makes up a new extra hot Chili dish, Dagwood eats it (despite Lou&#x27;s warnings) and Dagwood always ends drinking water endlessly to cool the burning spices in his mouth
* Dagwood has a propensity to nap on the couch during the day, often interrupted by Elmo, who wants to ask him a question, Blondie, who has a chore she wants him to do, or Dithers, who offers him his job back after he fired him.
* Dagwood sings in the bathtub, or is interrupted (usually by family members or Elmo) while he is trying to relax in the tub. Another gag along the same lines involves Dagwood reading books in the tub.
* Dagwood contends with brazen or obnoxious salesmen at his door, selling undesirable or impossible-looking items. It usually ends with Dagwood and the salesman getting into a physical confrontation.
* A variation of the above has the salesmen calling on the telephone.
* Dagwood and Herb Woodley spend some weekend time together, which usually escalates into a brawl.
* Dagwood demands a raise from Dithers and fails to get it every time.
* Dagwood gets caught goofing off or sleeping at his desk in the office.
* Mr. Dithers fires Dagwood for being incompetent or physically boots him out of his office, usually for messing up an important contract.
* Dagwood gets a menu suggestion from Lou, the wry, blunt, and/or sarcastic diner counterman.
* In the Christmas shopping gag, Dagwood is shown carrying Christmas packages that completely cover up his face and upper body.
* Herb borrows small items—tools, small appliances, books, and (more recently) videos—from Dagwood, then never returns them. Occasionally, Herb lends a borrowed item to a third party, which is then usually passed on to a fourth or fifth party.
* Dagwood&#x27;s hobby is household carpentry, but unfortunately his projects do not turn out well. Once, he built a small cabinet for Blondie, actually accomplishing all construction steps perfectly, but the result still fails because it does not fit in the space Blondie intended for it. Mostly, he is producing sawdust.
* Dagwood watches TV from his armchair while Daisy sleeps behind the chair; Blondie sits in her own chair facing away from Dagwood.
* From time to time, Dagwood will visit a pet shop and look at an animal (typically a bird) while the shop&#x27;s owner tells Dagwood some of the creature&#x27;s funny quirks.

===Sunday strips===
During the early years of the strip, the Sunday installments were much in the vein of the then-popular genre of &quot;pretty girl&quot; strips, rather than spoofing them as in the daily continuities, including a series of different suitors, most notably Hiho Hennepin, a short character who played a similar role to the one held by &quot;Dumb Dora&quot;&#x27;s boyfriend Rod. In fact, Dagwood did actually not appear at all in a Sunday page until late 1931, and was only regularly featured in these beginning on January 29, 1933.

Young drew &quot;The Family Foursome&quot; as a topper from September 21, 1930, to April 21, 1935, after which it was replaced by the pantomime strip &quot;Colonel Potterby and the Duchess&quot;, which ran until November 3, 1963 (becoming a stand-alone strip in 1958).

For years, the Sunday installments were noted for their histrionic plots, as well for having 12 panels, switching to the standard half-page format in 1986.

===Modernization===
While the distinctive look and running gags of &quot;Blondie&quot; have been carefully preserved through the decades, a number of details have been altered to keep up with changing times. The Bumstead kitchen, which remained essentially unchanged from the 1930s through the 1960s, has slowly acquired a more modern look (no more legs on the gas range and no more refrigerators shown with the compressor assembly on the top).

Dagwood no longer wears a hat when he goes to work, nor does Blondie wear her previous hat and gloves when leaving the house. Although some bedroom and bathroom scenes still show him in polka-dot boxer shorts, Dagwood no longer wears garters to hold up his socks. When at home, he frequently wears sport shirts, his standard dress shirt with one large button in the middle is slowly disappearing, and he no longer smokes a pipe at all. Blondie now often wears slacks, and she is no longer depicted as a housewife, since she teamed with Tootsie Woodley to launch a catering business in 1991. Dagwood still knocks heads with his boss, Mr. Dithers, but now does so in a more modern office at J.C. Dithers Construction Company, where desks now sport flat-panel computer monitors, and Mr. Dithers, when in a rage, attempts to smash his laptop into Dagwood&#x27;s head instead of his old manual typewriter. The staff no longer punches in at a mechanical &quot;time clock&quot;, nor do they wear green eyeshades and plastic &quot;sleeve protectors&quot;. Telephones have changed from candlestick style to more modern dial phones, to Touch-Tone, and on to cellphones. The round bedside alarm clock has been replaced by a more compact digital unit. Dagwood now begins each morning racing to meet his carpool rather than chasing after a missed streetcar or city bus. Even Mr. Beasley, the mail carrier, now dresses in short-sleeved shirts and walking shorts, rather than the military-style uniform of days gone by.

During the late 1990s and 2000–2001, Alexander worked part-time after high school at the order counter of a fast-food restaurant, the Burger Barn. Occasional references are still made to Cookie and her babysitting. Daisy, which once had a litter of puppies that lived with the family, is now the only dog seen in the Bumstead household. Cookie and Alexander can be seen in modern clothing trends and sometimes use cellphones and reference current television shows and social networking sites, while talking about attending rock concerts of popular current rock, pop, and hip hop music acts.

In this period, when in his basement woodworking shop, Dagwood was shown wearing safety eyeglasses.

Dagwood sometimes breaks the fourth wall by delivering the punchline to the strip, while looking directly at the reader, as in the above panel. Daisy occasionally does the same, though her remarks are limited to &quot;?&quot; and &quot;!&quot; with either a puzzled or a pained expression.

Strips in recent years have included references to recent developments in technology and communication, such as Facebook, Twitter, email, and text messaging.

===75th anniversary===
In 2005, the strip celebrated its 75th anniversary with an extended story arc in which characters from other strips, including &quot;Curtis&quot;, &quot;Garfield&quot;, &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;, and &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot;, made appearances in &quot;Blondie&quot;. The strip &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; made fun of the fact that their cast was not invited, and decided to invite themselves. This cross-over promotion began July 10, 2005 and continued until September 4, 2005.

===Foreign versions===
&quot;Blondie&quot; has been translated to various languages. In Mexico and South America, it ran as &quot;Lorenzo y Pepita&quot;, being quite popular between the 1940s and 1980s. While in most countries the family name was &quot;Parachoques&quot;, in Chile they had &quot;Jeringuis&quot; as a surname. When it ran in Spain, however, the original names were kept. In French-speaking countries, the strip is known as &quot;Blondinette&quot;, while Dagwood is known as Dagobert, a name which is still used in France and Belgium to refer to a kind of sandwich.

==Awards==
* In 1948, Chic Young&#x27;s work on the strip won him the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Billy DeBeck Award for Cartoonist of the Year. When the award name was renamed the Reuben Award in 1954, all the prior winners were given Reuben statuettes.
* In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of United States Postal Service commemorative postage stamps.

===Film===

&quot;Blondie&quot; was adapted into a long-running series of 28 low-budget theatrical B-features, produced by Columbia Pictures. Beginning with &quot;Blondie&quot; in 1938, the series lasted 12 years, through &quot;Beware of Blondie&quot; (1950). The two major roles were Penny Singleton as Blondie and Arthur Lake (whose first starring role was another comic strip character, Harold Teen) as Dagwood. Faithfulness to the comic strip was a major concern of the creators of the series. Little touches were added that were iconic to the strip, like the appearance of Dagwood&#x27;s famous sandwiches—and the running gag of Dagwood colliding with the mailman amid a flurry of letters, which preceded the title sequence in almost every film.

Columbia was careful to maintain continuity, so each picture progressed from where the last one left off. Thus, the Bumstead children grew from toddlers to young adults onscreen. Larry Simms played the Bumsteads&#x27; son in all the films; his character was originally called Baby Dumpling, and later became Alexander. Marjorie Kent (born Marjorie Ann Mutchie) joined the series in 1943 as daughter Cookie. Daisy had pups in the 12th feature, &quot;Blondie for Victory&quot; (1942). Danny Mummert, who had originally been chosen to play Baby Dumpling, took the continuing role of wiseguy neighbor Alvin Fuddle. Rounding out the regular supporting cast, character actor Jonathan Hale played Dagwood&#x27;s irascible boss, J.C. Dithers. Hale left the series in 1945 and was succeeded by Jerome Cowan as George M. Radcliffe in &quot;Blondie&#x27;s Big Moment&quot;. In the last film, &quot;Beware of Blondie&quot;, the Dithers character returned, played by Edward Earle and shown from the back. The Bumsteads&#x27; neighbors, the Woodleys, did not appear in the series until &quot;Beware of Blondie&quot;. They were played by Emory Parnell and Isabel Withers.

In 1943, Columbia felt the series was slipping, and ended the string with &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Life&quot; and &quot;Footlight Glamour&quot;, deliberately omitting &quot;Blondie&quot; from the titles to attract unwary moviegoers. After 14 Blondies, stars Singleton and Lake moved on to other productions. During their absence from the screen, Columbia heard from many exhibitors and fans who wanted them back. The studio reactivated the series, which ran another 14 films until discontinued permanently in 1950. Because some demand from movie theaters still existed, Columbia began reissuing the older films, beginning with the 1938 &quot;Blondie&quot;, and continued to release them in their original sequence well into the 1950s, when these were packaged for television by Columbia&#x27;s video subsidiary Screen Gems.

===Radio===

Singleton and Lake reprised their film roles for radio; the &quot;Blondie&quot; radio program had a long run spanning several networks. Initially a 1939 summer replacement program for &quot;The Eddie Cantor Show&quot; (sponsored by Camel Cigarettes), &quot;Blondie&quot; was heard on CBS until June 1944, when it moved briefly to NBC. Returning to CBS later that year, &quot;Blondie&quot; continued there under a new sponsor (Colgate-Palmolive) until June 1949. In its final season, the series was heard on ABC from October 1949 to July 1950.

===Television===
Two &quot;Blondie&quot; TV sitcoms have been produced to date, each lasting only one season.
* The first ran on NBC for 26 episodes in 1957, with Lake reprising his film and radio role and Pamela Britton as Blondie.
* The second, broadcast on CBS in the 1968–69 season, had Patricia Harty and Will Hutchins in the lead roles and veteran comic actor Jim Backus portraying Mr. Dithers.

===Animation===
Blondie and Dagwood were featured prominently in the cartoon movie &quot;Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter&quot;, which debuted on October 7, 1972. The movie was a part of &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot; series.

Blondie and Dagwood made a brief animated appearance in &quot;The Fantastic Funnies&quot;, a TV special focusing on newspaper comics that aired on CBS in 1980. They appeared in the beginning, singing a song to host Loni Anderson with other comic strip characters. Later on, after a short interview with Dean Young and Jim Raymond (who was drawing the strip at the time), they featured a short sequence where Blondie urges a reluctant Dagwood to get a haircut. The animation was produced by Bill Melendez Productions. Dagwood also makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Garfield Gets Real&quot;.

An animated cartoon TV special featuring the characters was made in 1987 by Marvel Productions (who had earlier collaborated with King Features for the animated series &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot;, starring King Feature&#x27;s adventure characters) and shown on CBS, with a second special, &quot;Second Wedding Workout&quot;, telecast in 1989. Blondie was voiced by Loni Anderson, Dagwood by Frank Welker. Both animated specials are available on the fourth DVD of the &quot;Advantage Cartoon Mega Pack&quot;. Both of these specials were paired with other comic strip-based specials; the first special was paired with a special based on &quot;Cathy&quot;, the second one was paired with &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot;. In Video (VHS) in UK: Leisureview Video in 1989.

In a 1989 episode of the animated series &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, entitled &quot;Comic Caper&quot;, Blondie and Dagwood make a cameo appearance. Blondie tells Dagwood that he is going to be late for work. As Dagwood rushes to the door, he knocks into the Muppet Babies, who have fallen into the world of the &quot;Blondie&quot; comic strip. Baby Kermit and Baby Piggy also parodied Blondie and Dagwood in one scene. The &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; series was produced by Marvel Productions, the producers of the 1987 and 1989 &quot;Blondie&quot; specials, and was also aired on the same network, CBS.

==Licensing and merchandise==
Over the years, &quot;Blondie&quot; characters have been merchandised as dolls, coloring books, toys, salt and pepper shakers, paint sets, paper doll cutouts, coffee mugs, cookie jars, neckties, lunchboxes, puzzles, games, Halloween costumes, Christmas ornaments, music boxes, refrigerator magnets, lapel pinbacks, greeting cards, and other products. In 2001, Dark Horse Comics issued two collectible figures of Dagwood and Blondie as part of their line of Classic Comic Characters—statues No. 19 and 20 respectively.

The Dagwood Sandwiches featured in the strip are a recurring licensing opportunity on their own. A counter-service restaurant called Blondie&#x27;s opened at Universal Orlando&#x27;s Islands of Adventure in May 1999, serving a traditional Dagwood-style sandwich. In fact, Blondie&#x27;s bills itself as &quot;Home of the Dagwood Sandwich&quot;. Lunch meats featuring Dagwood can be purchased at various grocery stores. In Canada, the Sobeys supermarket chain offers a family-sized sandwich called the Dagwood Sandwich.

<text>An actor
in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) &quot;specifies a role played by a user or any other system that interacts with the subject.&quot;

&quot;An Actor models a type of role played by an entity that interacts with the subject (e.g., by exchanging signals and data),
but which is external to the subject.&quot;

&quot;Actors may represent roles played by human users, external hardware, or other subjects. Actors do not necessarily represent specific physical entities but merely particular facets (i.e., “roles”) of some entities that are relevant to the specification of its associated use cases. A single physical instance may play the role of several different actors and a given actor may be played by multiple different instances.&quot;

UML 2 does not permit associations between Actors. The use of generalization/specialization relationship between actors is useful in modeling overlapping behaviours between actors and does not violate this constraint since a generalization relation is not a type of association.

Actors interact with use cases.

<text>The Citroën AX is a supermini which was built by the French manufacturer Citroën from 1986 to 1998. It was launched at the 1986 Paris Motor Show to replace the Citroën Visa and Citroën LNA.

==Overview==

Development of this model started in 1983, and it was initially also going to form the basis of a sister model from Talbot to replace the Samba; however, the falling popularity of the Talbot brand - coupled with the huge success of the new Peugeot 205 - had led to Peugeot deciding to axe it by the time the Citroën AX was launched, and so the Talbot version never made it into production.

The car was available on the left-hand drive continental markets from its launch on 2 October 1986, as a three-door hatchback with 1.0, 1.1 and 1.4 L TU-series belt driven OHC engines. A range of five-door models was added in 1987 and a 1.4 L diesel engine was introduced in 1988. The latter was replaced by a 1.5 L unit in September 1994. The right-hand drive version for the UK market was launched in August 1987, initially only as a three-door hatchback, with a five-door version joining the range a year later, effectively replacing the five-door Citroën Visa, which was discontinued that year. With the final demise of the classic Citroën 2CV in 1990, the AX became the smallest model in the Citroën range. The very earliest cars had an issue with gear shifters falling off; this was rectified by the time the AX reached export markets. It was initially backed by a memorable television advertising campaign filmed in China, starring actress Janet Mas and an elderly gentleman, whose character was simply known as Mr. Wong.
The car was very economical, largely because of excellent aerodynamics for its class of car (drag coefficient of 0.31) and a very light weight of for the basic version. This was due to the extensive use of plastic panels in non-load bearing areas and varying the thicknesses of steel in the bodyshell to be the minimum needed to take required loads. Another target for the engineers was lowering friction in the engines. The AX has fully independent suspension with unusually long wheel travel.

It also optionally used self-coloured plastic bumpers. This technology came from the PSA Peugeot-Citroën / Renault / French government ECO 2000 project. The production version was much more conservative than the original &#x27;one box&#x27; design prototype, that was closer to the Eco 2000 styling after negative reactions in focus groups. The &quot;one-box&quot; city car eventually came to market with the Renault Twingo, launched in 1992.

In 1989, a naturally aspirated diesel AX, using the 1360 cm3 all aluminium alloy TUD engine, managed a figure of , totalling over from Dover to Barcelona. This was the longest ever distance travelled on of fuel and earned it a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the most economical production car. Also available was a 4x4 variant, but with limited success when compared to the rival Fiat Panda 4x4. The AX 4x4 was only available with five doors and was not sold in the United Kingdom.

The first performance version was the limited-run AX Sport from 1987, with a 1.3 engine and twin carburettors producing , wearing iconic white steel wheels (5.5&quot; x 13&quot;) which resembled those on its brother, the Peugeot 205 Rallye. The AX Sport used Solex ADDHE 40 carburettors until late 1988 and was then replaced with Weber DCOM 40s, just like the Peugeot 205 Rallye. The AX Sport had a shorter inlet manifold than the 205 Rallye, to save room in the smaller engine compartment. In phase 2 guise, the Sport was available in other colours and with optional GT wheels and rear spoiler.

Later, the AX 14 GT, with a single double barrel carburetor 1.4L engine, also found in the Peugeot 205 XS, was introduced. From 1991, this model utilised fuel injection to coincide with the revamp of the entire range and to coincide with tougher 1992 EU emission regulations that introduced exhaust catalytic converters.

===Facelift===

Late 1991 saw the range revised, with a heavily facelifted tailgate and interior being the most notable changes. The front turn signals were now clear, and the Citroën logo was moved to the center of the bonnet. The much maligned dashboard was replaced by a more conservative design.

The following year saw the introduction of the most powerful AX variant, the GTi. The GT was sold alongside the GTi for a few months, but was eventually phased out. New models were also introduced, mostly as limited editions, such as the Forte, Spree, Elation and Dimension.

In January 1995, the Citroën AX Echo was launched, with a top speed of . Its closest competitor, the Peugeot 106 Ski, (that shared components with the AX), was outsold by the Echo.

In November 1995 (&#x27;96 model year), the AX Électrique was introduced. It was available as a four-seater passenger car, but was sold mainly to administrations, for which it was offered as a two-seater panel van model. Some pre-production vehicles have been on the road since December 1993, notably in La Rochelle. The AX Électrique was equipped with a 20 kW engine with a maximum speed of 91 km/h. The traction battery is composed of 20 nickel-cadmium monoblocks. The AX Électrique can reach 50 km/h in 8.3 seconds. Citroën reported an estimated urban range of 75 km. The vehicle weighs 995 kg (980 kg for the LCV versions, stripped of their rear seats).

From June 1996, following the introduction of the Saxo, the range was slimmed-down, with production of the AX ending in December 1998, after a 12-year production run. In May 1997, the production of the AX in Vigo, Spain, ended after 812,000 vehicles produced in the factory. The assembly of the model was maintained in Mangualde, Portugal for some months. It had been withdrawn from the UK market during the first half of 1997, following the demise of right-hand drive production. A total of 2,561,432 AXs were produced.

The Peugeot 106 (launched in 1991) and Citroën Saxo were both developments of the AX. They followed the 1990s trend for heavier, more solid and &#x27;safer&#x27; feeling cars that continues today. The AX was designed for lightness, with a &#x27;less is more&#x27; philosophy, but with more conventional styling than previous Citroëns.

==Derivatives==

In 1996, the EV3 engine (air engine) was mounted into a regular Citroën AX car by MDI. Heuliez presented an estate version called the AX Evasion at the 1988 Mondial de l&#x27;Automobile.

Besides the well known versions that are documented Citroën also produced a few rare variants.

Citroën also built a concept car named Xanthia based on the AX.

The Citroën AX BB Cabrio was a small roadster derived from the AX (1988). In Portugal, Citroën dealership &quot;Benjamin Barral&quot; from Amadora in Lisbon created an unofficial convertible version in the 1980s until about 1996 called the BB AX Cabrio, originally powered by the twin-choke carb AX GT 1.4 L engine, but later available with any type of engine that equipped the 3 door AX.

At one stage, parent firm PSA Peugeot Citroën had planned to launch a Talbot Samba replacement as a version of the AX with a different grille and a Talbot badge, but this plan was cancelled, as the entire Talbot marque was axed on passenger cars by 1987 following several years of declining sales.

Automobiles Citroën also launched the AX Pistes Rouges 4WD 1400 model, based on the standard three-door AX GT 1360cc engine but with a unique four-wheel-drive system developed and produced by the French Dangel company for between 1992 and 1994.

Malaysian car company Proton produced a version of the Citroën AX, the Proton Tiara, from 1996 to 2000.

===Mega Club/Ranch===
Aixam Mega at one time built an AX derivative called Mega Club and Mega Ranch. It was somewhat inspired by the Méhari, with a plastic bodywork and an optional convertible version, with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. It was discontinued in 1998, after nearly 1,000 had been built. A competition version of the Mega Club with a tubeframe chassis raced in the Andros Trophy in the early 1990, but powered by Ford and Honda engines.

=== Citroen AX Electrique ===

Citroën produced a number of 374 AX Electriques starting December 1993 to 1996. The car featured a liquid-cooled 100Ah Nickel-Cadmium (NiCad) battery running at 120V paired with a 20kW (26hp) electric motor which was capable of this peak power figure for short periods of time, but had a nominal power output of only 11kW (15hp). The range was estimated by Citroën to be around 75km with a top speed of 90km/h. Accleration from 0-50km/h is quoted at 8.3 seconds. The car also featured a proprietary fast charging system utilising the same input pins used to charge the car at home, and there were a number of such proprietary fast charging stations located around France permitting the car to recharge 20km in 10 minutes according to the Citroën Broschure. The AX electrique sold for 80,000 French Francs when new. The Citroën AX Electrique was succeeded by the Citroën Saxo Electrique. 

A modified version of the Citroën AX electrique utilising Lithium-Iron-Phosphate batteries (LiFePO4) by the CEA-Liten, a French government funded research organisation, set a world record in 2011 for a distance of 1,280km driven in an electric vehicle within 24 hours using a relay-style technique of driving and fast charging the car. The modified version of the car featured a 14kWh LiFePO4 battery in place of the original NiCad battery, which allowed the car to drive between 105-115km before fast charging the car in 38 minutes for the next leg of the relay.

<text>Rockstar North (Rockstar Games UK Limited; formerly DMA Design Limited) is a British video game developer and a studio of Rockstar Games based in Edinburgh. The studio is best known for creating the &quot;Lemmings&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, including &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, the second-best-selling game and most profitable entertainment product of all time.

David Jones founded the company as DMA Design in 1988 in his hometown of Dundee. During his studies, he had developed the game &quot;Menace&quot; and struck a six-game publishing deal with Psygnosis, which released Jones&#x27;s project in October 1988. While making its sequel, &quot;Blood Money&quot;, Jones dropped out, hired several of his friends, including Mike Dailly, Steve Hammond, and Russell Kay, with whom he had attended the Kingsway Amateur Computer Club. They opened the company&#x27;s first offices above a former fish and chip shop in 1989. Following the successful 1991 release of &quot;Lemmings&quot;, the studio rapidly expanded and moved into proper offices, after which Kay left to establish Visual Sciences. Several &quot;Lemmings&quot; expansions and sequels later, 1994&#x27;s &quot;All New World of Lemmings&quot; was DMA Design&#x27;s final game in the series and its last with Psygnosis.

After many halted projects from partnerships with Nintendo and BMG Interactive, Jones sold the financially stricken studio to Gremlin Interactive in April 1997. The subsequent spin-off of DMA Design&#x27;s American satellite studio triggered Hammond&#x27;s departure. While the commercially successful release of &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; led Take-Two Interactive to buy the game&#x27;s intellectual property and form Rockstar Games in 1998, &quot;Body Harvest&quot;″s underperformance later that year saw Gremlin Interactive being taken over by Infogrames. In September 1999, Infogrames sold DMA Design to Take-Two, enabling a close collaboration with Rockstar Games to release &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot;. Amid these changes, Dailly left for Visual Sciences, while Jones founded Denki and Real Time Worlds.

A few months after an Edinburgh branch was established for DMA Design, the prior Dundee location was closed. &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, the first &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; game presented fully in 3D, was released in 2001 and sold 6 million units in one year. Considered genre-defining, the game gave rise to a number of &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; clones. Take-Two integrated DMA Design with Rockstar Games as Rockstar Studios in March 2002, which was renamed Rockstar North in May. Since then, the studio has continued the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series with &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; (2002), &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; (2004), &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; (2008), and &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; (2013), as well as a number of smaller games in the franchise. Rockstar North also created &quot;Manhunt&quot; in 2003 and collaborated with other Rockstar Games studios on &quot;Manhunt 2&quot; (2007), &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot; (2010), &quot;L.A. Noire&quot; (2011), &quot;Max Payne 3&quot; (2012), and &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot; (2018).

== History ==

=== Background and formation (1983–1988) ===
Having frequently played &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in his youth, Rockstar North&#x27;s founder, the Dundee native David Jones, gained early programming knowledge when during his secondary education. In 1983, he took up an apprenticeship at the local plant of the electronics manufacturer Timex. Although the company was best known for producing watches, the Dundee factory also built home computers for Sinclair Research, including the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum, which had boosted interest in hobbyist programming in the area. Timex paid for programming courses at the local Kingsway Technical College, which also hosted the Kingsway Amateur Computer Club (KACC). Jones, the oldest attendee at the KACC, soon befriended Steve Hammond and Russell Kay, as well as Mike Dailly, the youngest participant at 14 years old, when he joined in 1984. The quartet bonded over their shared interest in creating original games instead of playing or cloning existing ones. During their time at the KACC, Dailly and Hammond developed &quot;Freek Out&quot; for the Commodore Plus/4, which they finished and sold to the publisher Cascade for &quot;a modest fee&quot;, while Jones and Kay cooperated on &quot;Moonshadow&quot; for the ZX Spectrum, which was eventually released as &quot;Zone Trooper&quot;. Jones and Dailly also worked on &quot;The Game With No Name&quot;.

As Sinclair Research&#x27;s market share dropped significantly during 1986, Timex enacted layoffs in Dundee. Jones accepted a voluntary redundancy for , a roughly half-year salary that he invested into an Amiga 1000, and subsequently enrolled in computer science at the Dundee Institute of Technology (DIT). Hammond also attended the DIT, and all four soon joined its computer club. Because Jones easily passed the course&#x27;s first year, he had much time to learn to programme for the Amiga and spent one year creating the shoot &#x27;em up &quot;CopperCon1&quot;. Working out of his parents&#x27; bedroom, he provisionally used the monicker &quot;Acme&quot;. The game featured graphics by the demoscene member Tony Smith, with whom he communicated by post, and sounds Dailly and Hammond recorded from a &quot;Salamander&quot; machine at a local arcade. After courting publishers at the Personal Computer World Show, Jones initially agreed to a publishing deal with Hewson Consultants but, fearing that his game would merely become the Amiga version of &quot;Zynaps&quot;, he walked away from the agreement.

Instead, he turned to the nascent Psygnosis in 1987 and agreed to a six-game publishing deal. &quot;CopperCon1&quot; was renamed &quot;Draconia&quot;, which was ultimately changed to &quot;Menace&quot; because the name was too similar to that of &quot;Draconus&quot;. Jones also agreed to bring Psygnosis&#x27;s &quot;Ballistix&quot; from the Amiga to the Commodore 64, for which he engaged Dailly and Hammond. In his search for a company name to replace the already taken &quot;Acme&quot;, Jones discussed alternatives with the members of the DIT&#x27;s computer club in 1988. Among others, &quot;Milliard&quot;, &quot;Visual Voyage&quot;, and &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; (in reference to &quot;Menace&quot;″s artist) were floated, and Jones finally settled on &quot;DMA Design&quot;. The abbreviation &quot;DMA&quot; stood for &quot;direct memory access&quot; in Amiga manuals but carried no meaning in the company name. While &quot;Direct Mind Access&quot; was official briefly, Jones eventually began stating that the abbreviation was short for &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Mean Anything&quot;. He formally founded DMA Design in 1988, when he was 22 years old.

=== Initial games with Psygnosis and &quot;Lemmings&quot; (1988–1994) ===
&quot;Menace&quot; was released in October 1988 after 18 months of development. It was DMA Design&#x27;s debut game and the first game under Psygnosis&#x27;s Psyclapse label for budget-priced games. Jones only received for every copy sold, which he retrospectively viewed as a &quot;terrible&quot; deal. Still, the 20,000 sales allowed him to buy a car and regularly visit the Psygnosis offices to meet other game developers. While working on a sequel to &quot;Menace&quot;, the difficulty of Jones&#x27;s university programme spiked, leading him to drop out and pursue game development full-time, against the advice of his professors. He intended to return after one year but never finished his studies, eventually receiving an honorary degree. Jones hired Dailly, who had just been expelled from college, as the first employee in 1989. Dailly began working on a Commodore 64 conversion of &quot;Menace&quot;. Hammond joined second on a part-time basis as he continued his education, followed shortly by Kay and Brian Watson, one of Jones&#x27;s university friends. The &quot;Menace&quot; sequel, &quot;Blood Money&quot;, was released in April 1989. It sold 40,000 copies. Gary Timmons joined the studio shortly after the game was completed, while Dailly developed its Commodore 64 version and began working on a PC Engine port of &quot;Shadow of the Beast&quot; for Psygnosis. DMA Design also made &quot;Shadow of the Beast&quot;″s Commodore 64 port and the PC Engine and MS-DOS versions for &quot;Ballistix&quot;.

Jones&#x27;s father-in-law, the owner of the Dundee fish and chip shop The Deep Sea, lent him a small office space above the shop&#x27;s former location at 134B Nethergate in Dundee. The infill building, built in 1893, is sometimes called the Wee Pink Nethergate House. The office was inaugurated on 1 August 1989. The studio continued to expand, also hiring many students to work part-time. In 1990, DMA Design cancelled several projects: The &quot;Golden Axe&quot;-inspired &quot;Gore!&quot; was shelved due to technical restrictions of the Amiga at the time and the platformer &quot;Cutiepoo&quot; did not make adequate progress after one year of work by the freelance programmer Tony Colgan. Jones further put aside his game &quot;Walker&quot; as he found he could not achieve his vision for it and stopped working on the Monster Cartridge, a cheat cartridge for the Amiga, after another such product was released first.

Working remotely from Edinburgh, the programmer Ian Dunlop and artist Neill Glancy began to experiment with the technology from &quot;Walker&quot;. When Dailly learned that they were working with characters just sixteen pixels tall, he challenged himself to create characters that were recognisable at half the height. During one lunch break, he animated a demo of small characters walking in a line and being killed comically, to the amusement of the office. Kay remarked that a game could be created from this. Jones concurred and thought of a design in which the player should prevent the characters from being killed. Kay wrote a demo before it was passed on to Dailly and later to Jones, who worked out the gameplay foundations with Timmons. The game was named &quot;Lemmings&quot; upon Kay&#x27;s suggestion and released in February 1991. It sold 55,000 copies on its first day and was swiftly brought to other regions and platforms. Jon Dye, another former KACC attendee, was hired later that year to bring the game to the ZX Spectrum.

&quot;Lemmings&quot; had 20 million lifetime sales across 21 platforms. At 25 years old, Jones became a millionaire and subsequently bought multiple luxury cars. The company rapidly expanded and began working on several additional projects. As Psygnosis sought DMA Design to produce &quot;Lemmings&quot; expansion packs and sequels in the wake of this success, the studio developed &quot;Oh No! More Lemmings&quot; (1991), &quot;Lemmings 2: The Tribes&quot; (1993), and &quot;All New World of Lemmings&quot; (1994). It also made the Christmas-themed &quot;Holiday Lemmings&quot; to be distributed for free on covermounts in 1991 and 1992, before Psygnosis made it a commercial release for 1993 and 1994.

By November 1992, DMA Design had grown to 22 staff, including 10 former classmates of Jones, and relocated to proper offices at the Dundee Technology Park. As Kay left DMA Design in 1993 to form Visual Sciences, Jones and Dailly hired Keith Hamilton as a replacement and put him in charge of &quot;All New World of Lemmings&quot;. This entry focused on larger, more detailed lemmings, which Hamilton and Jones later believed diminished the game&#x27;s charm. In the same year, Psygnosis released the Amiga-exclusive &quot;Walker&quot; and &quot;Hired Guns&quot;, which had been created principally by Scott Johnston with a story by Hammond. &quot;All New World of Lemmings&quot; was the final game in Jones&#x27;s original deal with Psygnosis. With the studio experiencing fatigue for the &quot;Lemmings&quot; series, Psygnosis hired other developers for subsequent entries, including Kay and Visual Sciences for &quot;Lemmings Paintball&quot;.

=== Partnerships with Nintendo and BMG Interactive (1994–1997) ===
After leaving &quot;Lemmings&quot; behind, DMA Design began researching development for the 3DO. In another project, Psygnosis briefly had DMA Design emulate an in-development &quot;Star Wars&quot; game on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). During one trade show, Jones caught the attention of Nintendo with a full-motion video &quot;Star Wars&quot; clip running on the SNES, something previously believed impossible. At the time, the company was seeking development partners for its upcoming Nintendo 64 console, which was then called Project Reality. DMA Design signed a two-game contract—worth several million pounds—and joined Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Dream Team&quot; of external partners. When this partnership was announced in April 1994, DMA Design was only Nintendo&#x27;s second partner for the platform. Using these funds, the studio grew to occupy of office space at the Dundee Technology Park and spent around outfitting all rooms with high-end devices. The partnership also led DMA Design to cease developing for the 3DO. The studio steered clear of other consoles, like the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, because Jones disliked &quot;multiformat publishing for the sake of it&quot;.

DMA Design&#x27;s first project for Nintendo was &quot;Unirally&quot;, a racing game featuring animated unicycles created using 2D sprites rendered from a 3D model. Following the game&#x27;s 1994 release for the SNES, the animation studio Pixar sued Nintendo over perceived similarities between the game&#x27;s characters and the unicycle protagonist from Pixar&#x27;s 1987 animated short film &quot;Red&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The judge ruled in Pixar&#x27;s favour and the two companies agreed that Nintendo would cease the production of &quot;Unirally&quot; copies while Pixar was to receive a Nintendo 64 game development kit. Despite the ruling, the game sold 300,000 copies. DMA Design continued working with Nintendo on &quot;Kid Kirby&quot;, a spin-off in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Kirby&quot; franchise made by Colgan after requesting a second chance from Jones. The game featured a young version of the title character, who would have been launched around levels using the Super NES Mouse. In November 1994, a team of five people commenced developing &quot;Body Harvest&quot;, scheduled to be a launch title for the Nintendo 64.

In the meantime, Dailly was experimenting with ways to render 3D buildings from a top-down perspective. To showcase this technology, he devised a game that saw the player control a dinosaur and destroy the city. After adding cars to make the scene more lively, a colleague suggested having the player drive these cars instead. Jones took notice of Dailly&#x27;s project and passed it to a team that should turn it into a game. In July 1993, The Liaison and Promotion Company began handling the marketing for DMA Design and its games, and it introduced the studio to potential partners for the project. Jones consequently presented a prototype of the game, which became known as &quot;Race&#x27;n&#x27;Chase&quot;, to BMG Interactive, the recently formed games arm of Bertelsmann. The two companies signed a contract in March 1995, wherein the studio would develop four games for the publisher. According to The Liaison and Promotion Company, Jones had not informed the firm of the impending deal, instead claiming he would partner with another company, such as Virgin Interactive Entertainment. DMA Design and The Liaison and Promotion Company then severed ties just before the deal with BMG Interactive had been finalised, and this became a legal dispute when DMA Design refused to pay the marketing firm.

The publishing agreement with BMG Interactive covered &quot;Race&#x27;n&#x27;Chase&quot;, &quot;Space Station Silicon Valley&quot;, &quot;Tanktics&quot;, and the stealth game &quot;Covert&quot;. With the acquired funds, DMA Design intended to expand its offices and increase its 40-strong headcount, quickly growing to 130 people. The company took over an additional of office space and expanded to two adjacent buildings, therein also setting up a motion capture studio that found little usage. Another section housed DMA Music with seven full-time musicians. &quot;Race&#x27;n&#x27;Chase&quot; formally began production in March 1995. The development team consisted mostly of recent graduates with little development experience, with Hamilton as the lead programmer. As such, the unorganised team struggled with the development until Gary Penn moved from BMG Interactive to DMA Design as the game&#x27;s creative director and producer. BMG Interactive&#x27;s production team, including the head of development Sam Houser, was hands-off during the development.

&quot;Body Harvest&quot; progressed slowly and faced numerous delays, such that it missed its intended launch with the Nintendo 64. The production also stalled on &quot;Kid Kirby&quot; and the climbing-themed action game &quot;Zenith&quot;, and Nintendo cancelled the former following the low sales of the Super NES Mouse. Furthermore, the American division of BMG Interactive regularly pushed for &quot;Race&#x27;n&#x27;Chase&quot; to be cancelled because the team kept missing development milestones. As the studio continued work on multiple games, several staffers believed &quot;Body Harvest&quot; would be a bigger hit. With DMA Design struggling financially, Jones kept agreeing to game projects solely to receive sign-on bonuses and with no plans to complete them. At one point, the studio had seven or eight projects in development at the same time. In the latter half of 1996, GT Interactive signed with DMA Design for &quot;Attack!&quot; and &quot;Clan Wars&quot;, despite neither draft having a proper team assigned. Jones also sold the rights to &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; to BMG Interactive to help keep the studio afloat. In November 1996, DMA Design opened a satellite studio in Boulder, Colorado. Anthony Harman was installed as the studio&#x27;s manager, and it had 27 employees by April 1997.

=== Sale to Gremlin Interactive (1997) ===
The development on &quot;Body Harvest&quot; stalled under the conflicting demands between the Japanese and American branches of Nintendo. The team sought to keep up its relationship with Nintendo and caved in to these demands. Despite stark changes to the game&#x27;s design, Nintendo was dissatisfied with the result and cancelled the game. Still in financial disarray and wanting his company to focus on game development, Jones arranged for Gremlin Graphics (since renamed Gremlin Interactive) to acquire DMA Design for in April 1997. The publisher was impressed with DMA Design&#x27;s multi-use 3DMA game engine and wanted the two companies to cooperate on research and development. It also expected DMA Design to become profitable within two years of the acquisition. Gremlin Interactive introduced several project management methods—including Microsoft Project and Gantt charts—that the studio perceived as unnecessary bureaucracy. Additionally, the company made DMA Design finish games as quickly as possible, as opposed to Jones&#x27;s prior methodology of releasing a game only once it is good. Jones received a 5% stake in Gremlin Interactive and became a member of its board of directors. He subsequently moved into the creative director role for DMA Design. In May, the studio had 100 employees.

As another result of the acquisition, the Boulder studio was spun off as a separate company. Under Harman&#x27;s continued leadership, it was renamed . The Boulder studio had been developing a remake of &quot;Hired Guns&quot; for Psygnosis with Hammond as the writer. Being more passionate about this project than &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, he left DMA Design to work on the remake in a freelance position, which he later said he regretted &quot;ever since&quot;. Devil&#x27;s Thumb Entertainment also developed &quot;Mike Piazza&#x27;s StrikeZone&quot; and &quot;Tides of War&quot; for GT Interactive. In March 1999, the studio was acquired and absorbed by the developer VR-1, also based in Boulder. The &quot;Hired Guns&quot; remake was never released.

Two months after DMA Design&#x27;s acquisition, Gremlin Interactive became a public company on the London Stock Exchange. Jones&#x27;s stake in the company was valued at at the time. Meanwhile, Bertelsmann had decided to withdraw from the video game industry and shut down the American division of BMG Interactive. In its place, the release in North America was licensed to ASC Games. Gremlin Interactive also picked up the rights to &quot;Body Harvest&quot; and engaged Midway Home Entertainment as the publisher in North America. For &quot;Tanktics&quot;, the North American publishing rights were sold to Interplay Entertainment. DMA Design further negotiated back the rights to &quot;Attack!&quot; and &quot;Clan Wars&quot; from GT Interactive.

By July 1997, The Liaison and Promotion Company had sued DMA Design for over breach of contract in relation to the deal with BMG Interactive. Lord Penrose, presiding over the case at the Court of Session, then opined that the marketing firm had been pivotal in the deal being reached and that DMA Design had taken a &quot;rather cynical action&quot; by excluding it from the negotiations, asserting that the actions did constitute breach of contract. Also in 1997, DMA Design became one of the founding members of the Scottish Game Alliance, alongside Visual Sciences and five other studios. Meanwhile, in November 1997, Jones helped the Dundee Institute of Technology (now called the University of Abertay Dundee) introduce an unprecedented computer games degree. In 1998, DMA Design developed games for a game design course at Dundee College.

=== Sale to Take-Two Interactive (1997–2000) ===
In the lead-up to the debut of &quot;Race&#x27;n&#x27;Chase&quot;, now renamed &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, BMG Interactive hired the publicist Max Clifford, who wanted to use controversy to market the game. Baron Campbell of Croy warned of the game at the United Kingdom&#x27;s House of Lords in May 1997, and several tabloid newspapers called for it to be banned in the country. &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; was released in November 1997 and, despite mixed reviews, quickly sold 500,000 units and generated . Visual Sciences developed the PlayStation port for &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, which was largely programmed by Kay and produced by Houser. The success diminished the focus on other games, particularly &quot;Space Station Silicon Valley&quot;, and a sequel was soon approved. Bertelsmann decided to ramp down BMG Interactive to reduce costs. At the same time, the publisher Take-Two Interactive was looking to grow its business and invited Houser to discuss his vision for game development. As a result, Take-Two acquired BMG Interactive, since dormant, for 1.85 million shares worth in March 1998. Through the acquisition, Take-Two also obtained the intellectual property of &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;Space Station Silicon Valley&quot;, and it published the former&#x27;s PlayStation version in North America later that year.

Houser subsequently moved over to Take-Two as its &quot;vice president of worldwide product development&quot;, in charge of internal and external development studios. The company also incrementally purchased all individual publishing rights for &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; from other companies to hold the exclusive rights to the game worldwide. &quot;Body Harvest&quot; and &quot;Space Station Silicon Valley&quot; were released in late 1998 but were scarcely marketed, leading to meagre sales. Houser and some of his former BMG Interactive colleagues joined Take-Two to form the Rockstar Games publishing label in December 1998. The newborn company commissioned its internal studio, Rockstar Canada, to develop two expansions for the original game, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: London 1969&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto: London 1961&quot;, which were released in 1999.

In March 1999, the poor sales of &quot;Body Harvest&quot; contributed to dire financials at Gremlin Interactive that forced it into a takeover by the French publisher Infogrames. During this year, Dailly left the company to join Kay at Visual Sciences as its head of research and development. Under the new ownership, Gremlin Interactive published DMA Design&#x27;s &quot;Wild Metal Country&quot; in May and &quot;Tanktics&quot; in June. As Infogrames was more conservative and sought to produce child-friendly games, it did not wish to hold on to any assets related to &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;. Take-Two Interactive bought DMA Design from the publisher in September 1999 for the nominal price of while assuming in debt. DMA Design henceforth worked closely with Rockstar Games, which Houser described as a &quot;perfect match&quot;. During these ownership and managerial changes, several projects were cancelled, including &quot;Attack!&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;Wild Metal Country&quot; for the Nintendo 64, and an &quot;Unreal&quot; version for the 64DD. At the time of Take-Two&#x27;s acquisition, DMA Design was working on &quot;GTA 3D&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Online Crime World&quot;.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot;, published by Rockstar Games, was released in October 1999 and quickly sold more than 1 million copies, the first Take-Two game to do so. Shortly thereafter, DMA Design established a satellite studio in the Leith area of Edinburgh to house the former teams of &quot;Body Harvest&quot; and &quot;Space Station Silicon Valley&quot;. Among those who relocated there were Leslie Benzies, Aaron Garbut, and Obbe Vermeij, all of whom had worked on &quot;Space Station Silicon Valley&quot;. Under the direction of Andrew Semple, the branch launched with 25 people. While the Edinburgh location continued to develop a 3D &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; game, now modelled after &quot;Driver&quot;, the Dundee office was working on an expansion for &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; set in Miami, of which the former was ultimately prioritised and became &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;. Jones was the last member of the original DMA Design team to work on this game. However, unhappy with his studio&#x27;s new overseas ownership, he departed the company in early 2000. With three other former DMA Design employees, he formed the game studio Denki. In February, alongside an investment in Denki, Rage Software hired Jones to oversee its operations in Scotland. Jones bought out Rage Software&#x27;s Dundee studio in 2002 to form Real Time Worlds, which went on to hire many past DMA Design staffers.

Rockstar Games released a Dreamcast port of &quot;Wild Metal Country&quot;, renamed &quot;Wild Metal&quot;, in February 2000. Take-Two encouraged DMA Design to narrow its focus to fewer, larger game projects. Many staffers felt at odds with this shift, as it diminished the prior atmosphere they felt was driven by creativity. The publisher closed the Dundee studio in March 2000, relocating many of the 35 staffers to Edinburgh and laying off the rest. The move was to enable a merger between DMA Design, Rockstar Games, and Pixel Broadband Studios under the &quot;Broadband Studios&quot; name. The combined entity would have largely leveraged Pixel Broadband Studios&#x27;s online game technology. Jim Woods, who had become the DMA Design&#x27;s managing director by this time, resigned as he wished to stay in Dundee. The merger was ultimately abandoned, as was &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Online Crime World&quot;.

=== &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; trilogy and rebranding as Rockstar North (2000–2004) ===
During the development of &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, DMA Design again expanded rapidly, forming a core team of 20 people and engaging &quot;dozens more&quot; in some capacity. The total team encompassed 60 people. The team retained the focus on a mostly unconstrained open world from the prior two games while introducing fully 3D graphics and a third-person view. With much of the game planned out from the start, the development progressed smoothly. Upon its release for the PlayStation 2 in late 2001, it became the best-selling game of that year, as well as the second-best in 2002. The game sold 6 million copies within one year and more than 15 million in total, exceeding the development team&#x27;s expectations. &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;″s approach to 3D open worlds has been referred to as genre-defining and inspired a number of successful titles, also spawning the category of &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; clones, which includes &quot;The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&quot;, &quot;True Crime: Streets of LA&quot;, &quot;Driver 3&quot;, and &quot;Saints Row&quot;.

Plans to outfit &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; with an online multiplayer component were scrapped in favour of a follow up, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;. Conceptualised as an expansion pack for &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, Rockstar Games made it a standalone product as its scope expanded. &quot;Vice City&quot; reused its predecessor&#x27;s engine, such that the programmers were not engaged until six months before the end of the production, and lessons learned from the previous development cycle allowed the designers to plan features more efficiently. In the meantime, the programmers worked on bringing &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; to personal computers. In March 2002, DMA Design was renamed Rockstar Studios, which Houser described as the studio&#x27;s &quot;final integration&quot; with Rockstar Games. The name was revised to Rockstar North in May. &quot;Vice City&quot; was completed in one year and released in late 2002. For its work on the game, Rockstar North won the &quot;best in-house development studio&quot; and &quot;creativity&quot; awards at the first Develop Industry Excellence Awards in August 2003.

Following &quot;Vice City&quot;″s release, Rockstar North began work on &quot;Z&quot;, a zombie survival game set on a Scottish island. The game repurposed code from &quot;Vice City&quot; and was in production for around one month before the concept lost traction at the studio. The studio&#x27;s &quot;Manhunt&quot;, a stealth game, was released in 2003 after roughly three years in development. Due to its dark tone and focus on realistic violence, it was considered the studio&#x27;s pet project, and most people at Rockstar Games wanted no part in it. Rockstar North assisted Rockstar Vienna and later Rockstar London in the production of a sequel, &quot;Manhunt 2&quot;, which entered into production in January 2004.

Rockstar North&#x27;s &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; was given one year of additional development time over &quot;Vice City&quot;, which allowed the team to rework core parts of the gameplay and visuals. It had a budget of less than . By the end of the game&#x27;s production, Rockstar North had relocated to offices on Calton Square in Edinburgh. &quot;San Andreas&quot; was released in October 2004. In four days, the game generated and sold 2.1 million copies, 45% above &quot;Vice City&quot;″s initial sales. Alongside several other year-end accolades, &quot;San Andreas&quot; was named the &quot;game of the year&quot; at the 2004 Spike Video Game Awards and 2005 Golden Joystick Awards. &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, &quot;Vice City&quot;, and &quot;San Andreas&quot; were bundled as &quot;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy&quot; in 2006. By 2008, they had amassed sales of 14.5 million, 17.5 million, and 21.5 million, respectively.

=== &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, and development collaborations (2004–2013) ===
After &quot;San Andreas&quot;, Rockstar North began producing &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;. At the same time, the studio commenced the production of a stealth game called &quot;Agent&quot; (codenamed &quot;Jimmy&quot; in reference to James Bond). A game with the same name and concept had previously been cancelled at the sister studio Rockstar San Diego, and Benzies was interested in furthering the idea. The studio was split evenly between the two projects, although &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; was soon prioritised over &quot;Agent&quot;. In 2009, the game was still planned as an exclusive title for the PlayStation 3. Its trademark was abandoned in 2018, and the listing was removed from Rockstar Games&#x27;s website in 2021. Meanwhile, Rockstar North worked closely with Rockstar Leeds on three &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; games for handheld game consoles: &quot;Liberty City Stories&quot;, &quot;Vice City Stories&quot;, and &quot;Chinatown Wars&quot;.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;″s production encompassed 220 people at the studio and 1,000 worldwide. Benzies estimated the budget at . Upon its April 2008 release, &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; broke the record for the highest revenue for a game within one day at from 3.6 million copies sold. At the 2008 Spike Video Game Awards, the game won &quot;game of the year&quot; and earned Rockstar North a nomination for &quot;best studio&quot;. The studio continued with two expansion packs—&quot;The Lost and Damned&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Gay Tony&quot;—which were later bundled as &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City&quot;. In the meantime, the studio contributed to Rockstar San Diego&#x27;s &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot; in 2010 and Team Bondi&#x27;s &quot;L.A. Noire&quot; in 2011. For &quot;Max Payne 3&quot; in 2012, Rockstar North assisted a number of other Rockstar Games studios collectively credited as &quot;Rockstar Studios&quot;.

Immediately following the completion of &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, Rockstar North began preliminary work on &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;. Rockstar North&#x27;s 360 employees formed the core of a worldwide team of 1,000 staff, including several other Rockstar Games studios. The core development took roughly three years, and the game was released in September 2013. The game broke the records for the best-selling and highest-grossing video game within one day and the fastest entertainment property to reach in revenue at three days. With continuing sales and the success of its online multiplayer counterpart, &quot;Grand Theft Auto Online&quot;, the game grossed an estimated by 2018, making it the most profitable entertainment product of all time. With 200 million copies sold as of March 2024, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; became the second-best-selling game ever, adding to the 425 million total sales for the series.

=== Continued expansion and departure of Leslie Benzies (2014–present) ===
In 2014, Rockstar North took over of office space in Barclay House on Holyrood Road in Edinburgh. The building had been constructued for the previous tenant, the newspaper group &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, in 1999. In the same year, the studio began receiving tax credits from the newly established Video Games Tax Relief scheme set up by the government of the United Kingdom. According to the investigative think tank TaxWatch UK, the studio had received by 2020, 37% of the scheme&#x27;s total payout, while having not paid any corporation tax since 2009. In response, Rockstar Games stated that the tax credits had enabled higher investments into the country, while The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment reported that the scheme had brought about a fourfold return on investment for the British economy.

Benzies, until then the studio head, went on a sabbatical in September 2014. He did not return and was announced as having left Rockstar North in January 2016. Garbut and Rob Nelson, both art directors for the studio, took over his responsibilities. Benzies sued Rockstar Games, Take-Two, Sam Houser, and Dan Houser on 12 April 2016, claiming that the companies had withheld in royalty payments following his departure. In the suit, he claimed that the Houser brothers had persuaded him to take a six-month sabbatical and fired his son and several friends during this absence. As Benzies tried to return after the planned end of his sabbatical in April 2015, his building access had been disabled and the office manager ordered him off the premises. The lawsuit stated that the three &quot;Rockstar Principals&quot;—himself and the Houser brothers—had established a shell corporation to evenly share profits and eventually leave Take-Two. Additionally, Benzies accused Sam Houser of having built a sexually charged culture and ineptly handling the development of &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot;.

Take-Two quickly filed a counterclaim and described Benzies&#x27;s claims as &quot;entirely without merit and in many instances downright bizarre&quot;. The claim asserted that, because Benzies had departed Rockstar North without a good cause, he was not entitled to any additional compensation. The New York Supreme Court partially dismissed Benzies&#x27;s lawsuit in April 2018 because the profit-sharing agreement did not guarantee equal pay for the Rockstar Principals, although he remained entitled to some royalties. Take-Two later accused Benzies of poaching employees from Rockstar North for his newer studio, Royal Circus Games, and argued that the company&#x27;s name and trademark had been deliberately chosen to have consumers confuse the two entities. Royal Circus Games was renamed Build a Rocket Boy in October 2018 and, following a confidential settlement, the case was dismissed on 8 February 2019.

For &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;, all Rockstar Games studios pooled their resources to act as one team. By the time the game was released in October 2018, Rockstar North had grown to 650 employees. In July 2021, Rockstar North bought Barclay House, where it had become the sole tenant, for and the adjacent Holyrood Park House, which it had since occupied parts of, for . During 2022, the studio grew to occupy an additional of office space in the latter.

Sally Yeh (born 30 September 1961), sometimes credited as Sally Yip or Yip Sin-man, is a Hong Kong and Canadian singer and actress.

==Early life==
Born in Taipei, Taiwan, Yeh immigrated to Canada at the age of four with her family and grew up in Victoria, British Columbia. As a result of this, she has Canadian citizenship.

==Career==

Yeh&#x27;s singing career started in the early 1980s and, shortly after, her acting career started as she sang songs specifically written for the movie soundtrack. She has released a total of thirty studio albums, plus compilations and live recordings. 

Yeh first relocated to Taiwan to pursue a career in singing, and later relocated to Hong Kong, which at the time was the primary center of Chinese entertainment, for a better chance at fame. Ng Ching Yuen, who was the CEO of Warner Music Hong Kong, arranged for her then-husband, George Lam, to teach Yeh to sing and speak Hong Kong Cantonese.

Since then, Yeh has focused primarily on the Hong Kong Cantonese entertainment world. With the support of utilizing romanization to read Chinese characters in Mandarin and Cantonese in addition to her interactions within the Chinese entertainment business, she began to make improvements on both her spoken Mandarin and Cantonese, including reading Chinese characters. However, because she never had a formal Chinese education, her proficiency in reading Chinese is still limited on various levels. When Yeh has to read Chinese characters, she still relies on Mandarin romanization and Cantonese romanization for support. In a July 2022 interview, Yeh admitted that over the years of her career singing Chinese songs, very often she is not able to fully understand the lyrics and has to listen to the arrangements of the music to be able to appropriately relate to the songs.

Yeh has received the Most Popular Hong Kong Female Singer award at the Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards four times (1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993). In 1992, Yeh collaborated with a couple of other western artists, recording &quot;I&#x27;m Always Dreaming of You&quot; with Tommy Page in 1992 and &quot;I Believe in Love&quot; with James Ingram the following year.

In 2002, Yeh re-entered the Cantopop market, released the record &quot;Can You Hear&quot;, and performed a series of concerts in different countries. In 2011, Yeh received the Golden Needle Award at the 33rd RTHK Top Ten Chinese Gold Song Music Award Ceremony. Yeh has also collaborated on a number of soundtracks (mostly on Tsui Hark&#x27;s movies with scores by Wong Jim), including &quot;Lai Ming But Yiu Loi&quot; from &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; (1987), which won the Best Original Song award at the 7th Hong Kong Film Awards.

==Image and artistry==
Yeh was one of the earliest Overseas Chinese celebrities to enter the entertainment industry in China during the 1980s and one of the few from an English-speaking country. She was also one of the earliest Mandarin speaking celebrities to enter the Hong Kong entertainment industry. In doing so, she paved a way for future divas such as Faye Wong, whom she collaborated with occasionally in her prime.

==Personal life==
On 17 July 1996, Yeh married Hong Kong pop star and composer-producer George Lam. She is stepmother to his two children.

Yeh speaks English, Mandarin, and Cantonese in that order of proficiency.

<doc id="426802" wikidata="Q5439483" url="?curid=426802" title="Fearless Leader">
<text>Fearless Leader is the main antagonist in the 1959–1964 animated television series &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; and &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot;, both shows often collectively referred to as &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;. He is the employer of fellow primary villains Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, serving as an overarching antagonist in some episodes of the series. He was originally voiced by Bill Scott.

==Character overview==
Fearless Leader is a dictator from the fictional country Pottsylvania, and the employer of the inept mobsters Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. He could always be found in his underground hideout, &quot;Central Control.&quot; However, it seems evident that he did answer to one man himself: the diminutive Mr. Big. Mr. Big appears in two storylines of the series, &quot;Upsidaisium&quot; and &quot;Metal Munching Moon Mice.&quot;

Fearless Leader has a notable face scar (possibly a dueling scar), much like the Nazi Otto Skorzeny, who may have been the inspiration for the character. As expected from his given position and name, Fearless Leader is a strict, ruthless character, and often harshly criticizes the incompetence of his main minion Gerald. He is usually shown with a long scar on his cheek and a monocle, both associated with German military officers in the first half of the 20th century, and he is sometimes shown to possess sharp carnivorous teeth. He is distrustful of his own employees, and is known to carry the Pottsylvania treasury with him wherever he goes. Although Pottsylvania&#x27;s chief spies are given ersatz Russian accents, Fearless Leader&#x27;s accent seems more in keeping with the Prussian militarist German stereotype. His monocle and sharply-angled features closely resemble Erich von Stroheim and characters from a 1942 anti-Nazi propaganda poster circulated during World War II. He uses some German such as &quot;Achtung&quot; and &quot;schweinhund,&quot; typical of German stereotypes in film and TV.

==In other media==
* Fearless Leader appears in live-action in two films: he is portrayed by Christopher Neame in &quot;Boris and Natasha: The Movie&quot; (1992) and by Robert De Niro in &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; (2000).
* Fearless Leader was also the background picture seen hanging on the wall in the old newspaper cartoon, &quot;Grin and Bear It&quot; by Lichty, whenever the Kremlin or politburo was being lampooned.
* Fearless Leader appears in the short film &quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot;, which was released with &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot; on Blu-ray 3D on October 14, 2014, in which he was voiced by Thomas Lennon who also wrote the short along with Robert Ben Garant.
* In the Amazon Video series &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, Fearless Leader is voiced by Piotr Michael. In the series, he has more participation that in the original, as he usually decides to carry on his plans by himself after Boris and Natasha are outsmarted by Rocky and Bullwinkle. He is given a more comical and accident-prone personality.

<text>General elections were held in South Africa on 2 June 1999. The result was a landslide victory for the governing African National Congress (ANC), which gained fourteen seats. Incumbent president Nelson Mandela declined to seek re-election as president on grounds of his age. This election was notable for the sharp decline of the New National Party, previously the National Party (NP), which without former State President F. W. de Klerk lost more than half of their former support base. The liberal Democratic Party became the largest opposition party, after being the fifth largest party in the previous elections in 1994. The number of parties represented in the National Assembly increased to thirteen, with the United Democratic Movement, jointly headed by former National Party member Roelf Meyer, and former ANC member Bantu Holomisa, being the most successful of the newcomers with fourteen seats.

<doc id="426806" wikidata="Q1272586" url="?curid=426806" title="Wulfstan (died 1095)">
<text>Wulfstan ( – 20 January 1095) was an English Benedictine monk who served as Bishop of Worcester from 1062 to 1095. He was the last surviving pre-Conquest bishop. Wulfstan is a saint in the Western Christian churches.

==Denomination==
His denomination as Wulfstan II is to indicate that he is the second Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester. This, however, does not prevent confusion, since the first Bishop Wulfstanhis maternal uncleis also called Wulfstan II to denote that &quot;he&quot; was the second Archbishop of York called Wulfstan.

==Life==

Wulfstan was born about 1008 at Long Itchington in the English county of Warwickshire. His family lost their lands around the time King Cnut of England came to the throne in 1016. He was probably named after his uncle, Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York. Through his uncle&#x27;s influence, he studied at monasteries in Evesham and Peterborough, before becoming a clerk at Worcester. During this time, his superiors, noting his reputation for dedication and chastity, urged him to join the priesthood. In 1034 Wulfstan served as incumbent at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Hawkesbury, Gloucestershire. It was here that he experienced an incident which changed his life. Whilst at his devotions he was distracted by the smell of a goose cooking in the kitchen nearby. Mortified, he resolved never to touch meat again and became a vegetarian. Wulfstan was ordained shortly thereafter, in 1038, and soon joined a monastery of Benedictines at Worcester.

Wulfstan served as treasurer and prior of Worcester, and from 1034 onwards served as the parish priest of Hawkesbury, Gloucestershire. When Ealdred, the bishop of Worcester as well as the Archbishop of York, was required to relinquish Worcester by Pope Nicholas, Ealdred decided to have Wulfstan appointed to Worcester. In addition, Ealdred continued to hold a number of the manors of the diocese. Wulfstan was consecrated Bishop of Worcester on 8 September 1062, by Ealdred. It would have been more proper for him to have been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose province Worcester was in. Wulfstan had deliberately avoided consecration by the current archbishop of Canterbury, Stigand, since Stigand&#x27;s own consecration had been uncanonical. Wulfstan still acknowledged that the see of Worcester was a suffragan of Canterbury. He made no profession of obedience to Ealdred, instead offering a profession of obedience to Stigand&#x27;s successor Lanfranc.

Wulfstan was a confidant of Harold Godwinson, who helped secure the bishopric for him.

A social reformer, Wulfstan struggled to bridge the gap between the old and new regimes, and to alleviate the suffering of the poor. He was a strong opponent of the slave trade, and together with Lanfranc, was mainly responsible for ending the trade from Bristol.

After the Norman conquest of England, Wulfstan was the only English-born bishop to retain his diocese for any significant time after the Conquest (all others had been replaced or succeeded by Normans by 1075). William of Malmesbury, whose early 12th century work &quot;Vita Wulfstani&quot; provides much of our knowledge of the bishop, noted that pastoral care of his diocese was Wulfstan&#x27;s principal interest.

In 1072 Wulfstan signed the Accord of Winchester. In 1075, Wulfstan and the Worcestershire fyrd militia countered the Revolt of the Earls, when various magnates attempted a rebellion against William the Conqueror.

Wulfstan founded the Great Malvern Priory, and undertook much large-scale rebuilding work, including Worcester Cathedral, Hereford Cathedral, Tewkesbury Abbey, and many other churches in the Worcester, Hereford and Gloucester areas. He famously wept upon the destruction of the old Worcester Cathedral to make way for the new Romanesque building, decrying the loss of a building in which &quot;so many holy and devout men have served God&quot;. After the Norman Conquest, he claimed that the Oswaldslow, a &quot;triple hundred&quot; administered by the bishops of Worcester, was free of interference by the local sheriff. This right to exclude the sheriff was recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086. Wulfstan also administered the diocese of Lichfield when it was vacant between 1071 and 1072.

As bishop, he often assisted the archbishops of York with consecrations, as they had few suffragan bishops. In 1073 Wulfstan helped Thomas of Bayeux consecrate Radulf as Bishop of Orkney, and in 1081 helped consecrate William de St-Calais as Bishop of Durham.

Wulfstan was responsible for the compilation by Hemming of the second cartulary of Worcester. He was close friends with Robert Losinga, the Bishop of Hereford, who was well known as a mathematician and astronomer.

Wulfstan, the last surviving pre-Conquest bishop, died 20 January 1095 after a protracted illness, whilst washing the feet of parishioners as was his custom. After his death, an altar was dedicated to him in Great Malvern Priory, next to those of Thomas Cantilupe and King Edward the Confessor.

==Legacy==
At Easter of 1158, Henry II and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine visited Worcester Cathedral and placed their crowns on the shrine of Wulfstan, vowing not to wear them again. Their son King John is buried at Worcester Cathedral.

Soon after Wulfstan&#x27;s death, a hagiography, or saint&#x27;s life, was written about him in English by his former chancellor Colman. It was translated into Latin by the medieval chronicler and historian William of Malmesbury. Wulfstan was canonized on 14 May 1203 by Pope Innocent III. He became the Patron Saint of Peasants and Vegetarians. One of the miracles attributed to Wulfstan was the curing of King Harold&#x27;s daughter. The recently founded Victorine priory in Celbridge, Ireland (paid for by Adam de Hereford) was named St. Wolstan&#x27;s Priory in his honour.

In 2008, the millennial anniversary of Wulfstan&#x27;s birth, the Friends of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Hawkesbury, where Wulfstan served from 1034, commissioned a stained glass window to his memory. The commission was carried out by a local artist, Caroline Pederick and it was dedicated in 2011 by Bishop Michael Pelham of Gloucester. In three roundels, it depicts features from Wulfstan&#x27;s life; the broken chains of slavery, the goose, many vegetables and the bishop&#x27;s crosier and mitre. In 2021, St. Mary&#x27;s Church installed a ring of eight bells in their tower. The largest bell, weighing 600 kg, is named in honour of Wulfstan.

Wulfstan is remembered in the Church of England with a lesser festival, and on the Episcopal Church calendar on 19 January.

In 2023, a pastoral area of the Catholic Diocese of Clifton was named in honour of Wulfstan.

<text>The Mennonite Church USA (MC USA) is an Anabaptist Christian denomination in the United States. Although the organization is a recent 2002 merger of the Mennonite Church and the General Conference Mennonite Church, the body has roots in the Radical Reformation of the 16th century.

Total membership in Mennonite Church USA denominations decreased from about 133,000, before the merger in 1998, to a total membership of 120,381 in the Mennonite Church USA in 2001 and 78,892 members in 2016. In May 2021 the main page of their website stated a membership of about 62,000.

==History==

===Mennonite Church (MC) (Mennonite General Conference and Mennonite General Assembly)===
Dutch and German immigrants from Krefeld, Germany, settled in Germantown, Pennsylvania, in 1683. Swiss Mennonites came to North America in the early part of the 18th century. Their first settlements were in Pennsylvania, then in Virginia and Ohio. These Swiss immigrants, combined with Dutch and German Mennonites and progressive Amish Mennonites who later united with them, until 2002 made up the largest body of Mennonites in North America (in the past often referred to as the &quot;Old Mennonites&quot;). They formed regional conferences in the 18th century. As early as 1725, delegates from various Pennsylvania Mennonite settlements met to adopt the Dordrecht Confession of Faith as their official statement of faith. The &quot;Old&quot; Mennonite Church was marked by ties of communion, pulpit exchange, and common confession, rather than formal organizational ties. Many, but not all, of the conferences joined the North American conference, the Mennonite General Conference, in 1898. The Mennonite General Conference was reorganized in 1971 as the Mennonite General Assembly. The Mennonite General Assembly merged with the General Conference Mennonite Church in 2002.

===General Conference Mennonite Church (GCMC)===
The General Conference Mennonite Church was an association of Mennonite congregations located in North America from 1860 to 2002. The conference was formed in 1860 by congregations in Iowa seeking to unite with like-minded Mennonites to pursue common goals such as higher education and mission work. The conference was especially attractive to recent Mennonite and Amish immigrants to North America and expanded considerably when thousands of Russian Mennonites arrived in North America starting in the 1870s. Conference offices were located in Winnipeg, Manitoba and North Newton, Kansas. The conference supported a seminary and several colleges. By the 1980s, there remained little difference between the General Conference Mennonite Church and many conferences in the Mennonite General Assembly. In the 1990s the conference had 64,431 members in 410 congregations in Canada, the United States and South America.

===Merger===
In 1983 the &quot;General Assembly of the Mennonite Church&quot; met jointly with the &quot;General Conference Mennonite Church&quot; in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in celebration of 300 years of Mennonite witness in the Americas. Beginning in 1989, a series of consultations, discussions, proposals, and sessions (and a vote in 1995 in favor of merger) led to the unification of these two major North American Mennonite bodies into one denomination organized on two fronts – the Mennonite Church USA and the Mennonite Church Canada. The merger was &quot;finalized&quot; at a joint session in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1999, and the Canadian branch moved quickly ahead. The United States branch did not complete their organization until the meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2001, which became effective February 1, 2002.

The merger of 1999-2002 at least partially fulfilled the desire of the founders of the &quot;General Conference Mennonite Church&quot; to create an organization under which all Mennonites could unite. Yet not all Mennonites favored the merger. The Alliance of Mennonite Evangelical Congregations represents one expression of the disappointment with the merger and the events that led up to it.

===Decline===

Since its merger, a large number of conservative congregations have left Mennonite Church USA. 2013 saw nine congregations leave, and in 2014 at least 12 did so. In November 2015, the Lancaster Conference, Mennonite Church USA&#x27;s largest conference, with 13,838 members in 163 congregations in six states plus the District of Columbia, voted overwhelmingly to leave the denomination by the end of 2017.

By early 2016 the membership had decreased to 78,892 members. This decline was is generally attributed to the denomination&#x27;s increasingly liberal position towards same sex marriage, among other issues, which caused many congregations to leave Mennonite Church USA. In April 2016, the Franklin Mennonite Conference, a conference with 14 congregations and about 1,000 members in Pennsylvania and Maryland, voted to withdraw from the Mennonite Church USA. In 2018 the number of baptized members had fallen to 69,223 and the number congregations to 625.

=== Political Involvement ===
For most of its history, the Mennonite Church has stayed away from political involvement. This came from a desire to separate the church from the culture of the world. In 1968 Mennonite Central Committee, the governing body for the Mennonite Church, created an advocacy office in Washington, DC. This was a drastic shift in how the church approached politics and was not appreciated by many members at the time. Since then, the church has become more politically involved as this became more normalized.

==Structure==

===Convention and delegate assembly===
Every other year, Mennonite Church USA holds a week-long, church-wide convention. The convention includes gatherings for adults, youth, junior youth and children (K-5, Preschool and Infants/Toddlers). During the convention, there are worship sessions, seminars, alumni gatherings, and special dinners. Also, taking place during the convention is the Delegate Assembly. Delegates from local congregations, regional area conferences, and constituency groups gather to develop vision and direction for the national denomination. Previous conventions have been held in Nashville, Tennessee (2001), Atlanta, Georgia (2003), Charlotte, North Carolina (2005), San Jose, California (2007), Columbus, Ohio (2009), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (2011), Phoenix, Arizona (2013), Kansas City, Missouri (2015, 2019, 2021, 2023), and Orlando, Florida (2017).

===Area conferences===
All congregations in the denomination belong to an area conference, and it is the area conference that is the component part of Mennonite Church USA. There are currently 21 area conferences with many of them overlapping geographically due to conference structures prior to the merger. Recently, some divisions have occurred and the Lancaster Conference (not included here) voted in 2015 to leave the Mennonite Church U.S.A. by 2017.
===Agencies===
Mennonite Church USA maintains five church-wide ministry agencies: Mennonite Mission Network, Mennonite Education Agency, MennoMedia (formerly Mennonite Publishing Network), Mennonite Health Services, and Everence (formerly Mennonite Mutual Aid).

===Mennonite Education Agency===
The mission of Mennonite Education Agency (MEA) is to strengthen the life, witness and identity of Mennonite Church USA through education. MEA helps provide leadership to Mennonite Schools Council, elementary and secondary schools throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada. MEA also helps bring support and leadership to Mennonite colleges, universities, and seminaries located throughout the United States. It also works with various people and groups within Mennonite Church USA to help involve them and show the unique qualities of Mennonite education. MEA works with Mennonite Church USA to provide leadership to church educational programs.

===Colleges and seminaries===
Mennonite Church USA provides denominational oversight through Mennonite Education Agency to five colleges and universities and two seminaries in the United States:

*Goshen College in Goshen, Indiana
*Bluffton University in Bluffton, Ohio
*Bethel College in North Newton, Kansas
*Eastern Mennonite University in Harrisonburg, Virginia
*Hesston College in Hesston, Kansas
*Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary in Elkhart, Indiana
*Eastern Mennonite Seminary on the campus of Eastern Mennonite University in Harrisonburg, Virginia

===Secondary schools===
* Bethany Christian Schools, Goshen, Indiana
* Central Christian School, Kidron, Ohio
* Dock Mennonite Academy, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania
* Eastern Mennonite High School, Harrisonburg, Virginia
* Freeman Academy, Freeman, South Dakota
* Lancaster Mennonite High School, Lancaster, Pennsylvania
* Philadelphia Mennonite High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
* Hillcrest Academy, Kalona, Iowa (formerly Iowa Mennonite School)

==Faith and practice==
===&quot;Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective&quot;===
A &quot;Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective&quot; provides a guide to the beliefs and practices of Mennonite Church USA. This confession was adopted in 1995 at a joint session of the Mennonite Church and General Conference Mennonite Church in Wichita, Kansas. It contains 24 articles ranging from the more general Christian theologies of God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit to the more distinct Foot Washing; Truth and the Avoidance of Oaths, Peace, Justice, and Nonresistance; and The Church&#x27;s Relation to Government and Society.

===Sexuality discussions===
The Brethren Mennonite Council has been active since 1976 to encourage &quot;full inclusion&quot; for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons in the church. In 1986 the General Conference Mennonite Church (one of the predecessors of Mennonite Church USA), meeting in Saskatoon, adopted a statement on sexuality establishing heterosexuality as the only legitimate form of sexual expression. In 1987, the Mennonite Church (another predecessor of MC USA) issued the Purdue Statement, with similar language. At the 2009 convention in Columbus, some protested for the further discussion of human sexuality. In 2015 discussions revolved around the decision by multiple conferences to license openly LGBT members for church ministry. Two districts within the denomination had licensed pastors openly in committed same-sex relationships. Due to the denomination&#x27;s increasingly liberal position, the Lancaster Conference voted in November 2015 to leave the Mennonite Church USA. At the same time, toward the end of 2015, the Western District Conference voted to allow ordained ministers to officiate at and perform same-gender marriages. On 29 May 2022 the church repealed the Membership Guidelines that forbids pastors to officiate same-sex marriages. Some area conferences already allowed pastors to solemnize same-sex marriages. The church also voted in favor of an apology to the LGBTQ community.

===Life issues===
Mennonites have a commitment to pacifism, and members of Mennonite Church USA have a history of being conscientious objectors in wars as a way to uphold a commitment to nonviolence. They also oppose abortion and capital punishment.

MC USA has passed a resolution committing to creation care (2013) as developed by Mennonite Creation Care Network (MCCN), which in 2013 had a membership directory of 650 individuals to &quot;advance the commitment of congregations and members in caring for creation as part of the good news of Jesus Christ&quot; and a resolution on &quot;Seeking Peace in Israel and Palestine&quot; (2017).

MC USA released a &quot;Churchwide Statement on Immigration&quot; in 2014 that states, &quot;We advocate for just and humane immigration policies for immigrants and refugees, and we empower congregations, area conferences and denominational staff to serve as advocates for these vulnerable groups of peoples and resolutions pertaining to immigration.&quot;

MC USA&#x27;s &quot;Churchwide Statement on Sexual Abuse&quot; (2015) states, &quot;We resolve to tell the truth about sexual abuse; hold abusers accountable; acknowledge the seriousness of their sin; listen with care to those who have been wounded; protect vulnerable persons from injury; work restoratively for justice; and hold out hope that wounds will be healed, forgiveness offered, and relationships established or reestablished in healthy ways.&quot;

<doc id="426823" wikidata="Q764728" url="?curid=426823" title="2-10-0">
<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 2-10-0 represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle, ten powered and coupled driving wheels on five axles, and no trailing wheels. This arrangement was often named Decapod, especially in the United States, although this name was sometimes applied to locomotives of 0-10-0 &quot;Ten-Coupled&quot; arrangement, particularly in the United Kingdom. Notable German locomotives of this type include the war locomotives of Class 52.

These locomotives were popular in Europe, particularly in Germany and Russia; British use of the type was confined to the period during and after World War II. In the United States, the 2-10-0 was not widely popular but was a favorite of a small number of railroads which operated mostly in mountainous terrain. Among these was the Erie Railroad, a major Chicago to New York trunk line railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad, whose heavily graded routes crossed the Allegheny Mountains.

The 2-10-0&#x27;s main advantage was that five out of six of its axles were powered, meaning almost all the weight was available for traction rather than being distributed over pilot and trailing wheels. The long rigid wheelbase caused problems on tightly curved track, so blind drivers were the norm, either on the central axle, and/or on the second and/or fourth axles. Often lateral motion devices were attached to the leading drive axle.

The wheel arrangement&#x27;s disadvantages included the firebox size restriction caused by the lack of trailing wheel. This meant the firebox was fitted in between the wheels (common on earlier locomotives) and was long and narrow, or if mounted above the driving wheels, was wide and long but shallow. Many locomotives chose the latter option. A firebox mounted over the drivers also restricted the diameter of the driving wheels, which in turn limited speed. As with the Consolidation (2-8-0), &quot;chopping&quot; at speed ensured a rough ride for the crew due to instability caused by the wheel arrangement. In fact, backing any locomotive without a trailing axle was restricted to under twenty miles per hour or less. Most 2-10-0s were not operated at speeds greater than 50 mph (80 km/h).

The type operated as freight engine, although locomotives in Germany and the United Kingdom proved capable of hauling passenger trains.

== United States ==

The first Decapods were built for the Lehigh Valley Railroad in the late-1860s. They proved too rough on the track because of their long coupled wheelbase. No more followed for 19 years, until the Northern Pacific Railway bought two for use on the switchbacks over Stampede Pass, while the tunnel was being built. In low-speed service where high tractive effort was critical, these Decapods were successful. Small numbers of other Decapods were built over the next twenty years, mostly for service in steeply graded mountainous areas where power at low speeds was the requirement. The type did not prove as popular as the successful Consolidation (2-8-0) type. Among Decapod users was the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The engines were tandem compounds but their ongoing reversing limitations became the genesis of the 2-10-2 wheel arrangement.
The first boost in the number of Decapods occurred when Imperial Russia ordered approximately 1,200 Decapods from American builders during World War I. When the Bolshevik revolution occurred in 1917, 857 had already been delivered, but more than 200 were either awaiting shipment or were in the process of construction. These stranded locomotives were adopted by the United States Railroad Administration (USRA), the body created by the Government to oversee and control the railroads during the War, converted to American standards, and put to use on American railroads. Small and light-footed, these Russian decapods proved popular with smaller railroads, and many of them remained in service long after the USRA&#x27;s control of the railroads ceased. Many indeed lasted until the end of steam on those railroads.
Swengel suggested the 2-10-0 arrangement was &#x27;obsolete&#x27; by 1916, when the Pennsylvania Railroad commenced an experiment with a 2-10-0 locomotive at its Juniata plant. Most 10 coupled engines constructed for U.S. railroads during World War I were of the USRA 2-10-2 arrangement, but the PRR committed to 122 of the 2-10-0s. Swengel argued this commitment to the 2-10-0, nicknamed &quot;Deks&quot;, was controversial even in 1916 and was more so in 1922 when the PRR placed additional orders. The PRR was soon the biggest user of Decapods in the United States. The type was ideally suited to the Pennsy&#x27;s heavily graded Allegheny Mountains routes, which required lugging ability according to tractive effort, not speed according to horse power.

The PRR bought 598 2-10-0s including 123 built at its own shops. In one of the largest locomotive orders ever, the rest came from the Baldwin Locomotive Works. The PRR 2-10-0s weighed and developed about of tractive effort with an axle loading of over . The engines steamed at and had a relatively large superheater. The grate area of about was on the small side, but a mechanical stoker partly compensated for this.

The PRR decapod, class I1s, was unlike the Russian decapod; it was huge, taking advantage of the PRR&#x27;s heavy trackage and high axle loading, with a fat, free-steaming boiler that earned the type the nickname of &#x27;Hippos&#x27; on the PRR. Two giant cylinders (30½ x 32 inch) gave the I1s power and their tenders permitted hard and long workings between stops. They were unpopular with the crews, for they were hard riding. The last operations on the PRR were 1957.

A small number of other Decapods were ordered by other railroads; the I-2 Decapods built for the Western Maryland Railway were the largest ever built, at almost weight, and are a notable exception to the rule of thumb for the comfort of the ride on a 2-10-0 wheel arrangement, crews said the engines cruised smoothly up to 50 mph without becoming a rough ride. (After the running gear was redesigned by the WM) The WM&#x27;s I-2 are also noted as the strongest Decapods ever built, at 96,315 lbs of tractive effort. (Not to be confused with the 10 Russian Decapods the WM held in their roster, which were standard Russian Decapods aside from heavier steel frames the WM used to replace the original cast iron frames, the new frames also made the WM Russian Decapods 2 inches longer than other Russian Decapods)

Baldwin developed two standard 2-10-0s for railroads with low axle-load requirements.

Thirteen Decapod locomotives survive in the US, including two Baldwin standards, six Russian Decapods and one PRR I1. Two, Great Western 90, a Baldwin Decapod at the Strasburg Rail Road, and Frisco 1630, a Russian Decapod at the Illinois Railway Museum, are operational. One Decapod survives as a static exhibit at the North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer, North Carolina (Seaboard Air Line 2-10-0 #544).

=== Preserved Decapods in the United States ===
*1621 is on display at the National National Museum of Transportation - St. Louis, MO
*1625 is on display at the Museum of the American Railroad - Frisco, TX
*1630 is operated by the Illinois Railway Museum - Union, IL.
*90 is operated by Strasburg Railroad - Strasburg, PA.
*I1 class 4483 is at Hamburg, New York.

===Proposed/Unbuilt (US)===
L.D. Porta proposed a 2-10-0, triple expansion Modern steam locomotive as a &quot;second generation&quot; fast-freight locomotive for the ACE 3000 project based on his previous works.

== Germany ==

The 2-10-0 arrangement was a very popular one in Germany. The first were built by the individual state railways from 1915 to 1918, and these later became the DRG BR58. The DRG then produced a number of standard classes of 2-10-0s: the heavy 3-cylinder BR44 (1753 built), the two-cylinder version BR43 (35 built), and the lightweight BR50 (3164 built). During wartime, the BR44 and BR50 designs were simplified as ÜK (&quot;Übergangs Kriegslokomotiven&quot;, or interim war locomotives). By 1941, it was clear that even these were too complicated, expensive, time-consuming to build, and used too much material in short supply, so new &quot;Kriegslokomotive&quot; (war locomotive) designs were developed: the lightweight BR52 (7794 built) and the intermediate weight BR42 (859 built).

Postwar locomotives of these types, particularly the BR 52, were spread all over Europe and were taken into service by the railways of many different countries:
* BR44 in France, SNCF 150X.
* BR50 in Belgium, NMBS/SNCB class 25; in Denmark, DSB class N.
* BR52 in Austria, ÖBB class 52; in Belgium, NMBS/SNCB class 26; in Norway, NSB Class 63.

== United Kingdom ==

Locomotives with ten driving wheels were rare in British railway history. In 1913 an initial design for a four-cylinder 2-10-0 of tractive effort was produced by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, but none were built. This had been inspired by Jean-Baptiste Flamme&#x27;s 2-10-0s working in Belgium and used a similar tapered boiler, with the round-topped firebox almost filling the loading gauge. The first 2-10-0 was built during the Second World War, as a variant of the &quot;Austerity&quot; 2-8-0 for lightly built railways.

The only other 2-10-0 type was the 251-strong Standard class 9F introduced by British Railways in 1954. The class included 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot;, the last steam locomotive built for British Railways, in 1960; and 92203 (named &quot;Black Prince&quot; when preserved), which in 1983 set a record for the heaviest steam locomotive-hauled train in Britain when it started a 2,162-ton train at Foster Yeoman quarry in Somerset.

== Finland ==

The State Railroads of Finland purchased 20 American Decapods after WWII - these were originally built for the Soviet Union, but never delivered to them. Of the 20 engines, 10 were made by Baldwin, 10 by Alco. Since they were originally built for the USSR, they had the correct gauge for Finland, too ( exactly). One (Alco # 75214, 1947) is preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum in Hyvinkää, Finland. The Finnish designation was Tr2.

The locomotive was nicknamed &quot;Truman&quot; in Finland. It was used for hauling heavy freight trains.

== France ==
From 1910 to 1951, the French industry built more than 500 decapods for three railway companies (Paris-Orléans, Nord, Est) and for the national railways (SNCF). Moreover, at the end of World War II, SNCF inherited more than 200 units of German decapods built in France, mostly BR 44. The last decapod, a SNCF 150P, was withdrawn in 1968. All 2-10-0s, of French or of German design, proved reliable and powerful in service. One can notice that some engines of the Paris-Orléans company were dedicated to passenger service on difficult mountain lines.

==Poland==
Between early 1920s and 1958 Polish industry delivered to PKP some 1200 decapods of classes , , and . PKP also operated German decapods BR 52 (Ty2) and BR 42 (Ty3), as well as American ones (, nicknamed &quot;Trumman&quot;). They were used to work the heaviest goods trains.

==Romania==

After the Second World War, Romania built the 150.000 Class, after DRB Class 50. A total of 282 locomotives were built between 1946 and 1960, at Malaxa (later &quot;23 August Works&quot;) in Bucharest, and in Reşiţa.

Builder details:
* 150.001-150.050 Reşiţa
* 150.051-150.081 Malaxa
* 150.082-150.282 Reşiţa

== Soviet Union ==
2-10-0 were fairly common freight locomotives in the former Soviet Union. They came from several sources: US imports (class Ye (), built by ALCO and Baldwin, respectively), German war trophy DRB 52 class locomotives (what became the Soviet TE-series) and locally built. The locally built 2-10-0 locomotives were represented by some TE (built from captured German parts), SO (Sergo Ordjonikidze) and L (Lebedyanski)–series locomotives. The L-series locomotives were one of the more advanced steam locomotives built in the former Soviet Union. They used an automatic stoker to feed coal and had a relatively low axle load (18 tonnes or 40,000 lb) to be compatible with the war-torn railroads of the former Soviet Union. Several examples of these locomotives are still preserved in working order.

There is a 2-10-0 Lebedyanski series locomotive L 4657, marooned in a siding at Port Baikal.

<doc id="426825" wikidata="Q1050607" url="?curid=426825" title="Caretaker manager">
<text>In association footballing terms, a caretaker manager or interim manager is somebody who takes temporary charge of the management of a football team, usually when the regular manager is dismissed or leaves for a different club. However, a caretaker manager may also be appointed if the regular manager is suspended, ill, has suspected COVID-19 or is unable to attend to their usual duties. Examples of caretaker managers are Jordi Roura, Angelo Alessio, Germán Burgos and Rob Page. Caretaker managers are normally appointed at short notice from within the club, usually the assistant manager, a senior coach, or an experienced player.

==Caretaker managers in Eastern Europe==
Caretaker managers in Eastern Europe are head coaches that carry prefix title performing duties or sometimes temporary performing duties. These managers do not have a required license (UEFA Pro Licence) to be full head coaches (managers) and oftentimes have a UEFA A License.

Normally, caretaker manager duties performed by an assistant head coach, sometimes titled as a senior coach, once approved by the club. In case if whole head coaching office was dismissed, a caretaker or a caretaker manager would be appointed from outside of the club. The outside caretaker also may be appointed also instead of already employed a head coach assistant or a senior coach.

==Caretaker managers in practice==
Famous examples include long-standing Arsenal assistant manager Stewart Houston, who stepped in after George Graham was abruptly sacked in the middle of the 1994–95 season and guided the club to the 1995 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final. Tony Barton was appointed manager of Aston Villa after the departure of Ron Saunders and led the club to win the 1982 European Cup Final after only three months in charge. Club Director Trevor Brooking was appointed caretaker manager of West Ham United following Glenn Roeder&#x27;s illness at the end of the 2002–03 season, then again following his dismissal early in the 2003–04 season.

==Permanent appointments==
If a caretaker manager proves to be particularly successful during their spell in charge, they are sometimes given the manager&#x27;s job permanently. Glenn Roeder was appointed permanent manager of Newcastle United after having taken over as caretaker manager following Graeme Souness&#x27;s dismissal in 2006. This also occurred when Ricky Sbragia was given the Sunderland job permanently after Roy Keane&#x27;s resignation in November 2008 but he also resigned at the end of the season 2008–09. This also happened in the 2010–11 Premier League; on 8 January 2011, Roy Hodgson was sacked by Liverpool after a run of poor results, and with Liverpool languishing in 12th place, Kenny Dalglish was appointed the caretaker manager of Liverpool for the remainder of the season. After an impressive run of results, which saw Liverpool rise to sixth in the table, Dalglish was appointed the permanent manager of Liverpool, on a three-year contract. In the 2018–19 Premier League; on 18 December 2018, José Mourinho was sacked by Manchester United after losing 3–1 against Liverpool, and with Manchester United in sixth place, former player Ole Gunnar Solskjær was appointed the caretaker manager of Manchester United for the rest of the season. After an impressive run of results, which saw Manchester United rise to fourth in the table and qualified for UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, Solskjær was appointed permanent manager of Manchester United on 28 March 2019 on a three-year contract.

In Norway, a notable example occurred in 2006 when Rosenborg BK coach Per-Mathias Høgmo announced he was taking a leave of absence in mid-season, citing health concerns. At the time, Rosenborg were ten points behind leaders SK Brann. His assistant Knut Tørum was appointed on a caretaker basis, and proceeded to lead Rosenborg to a furious comeback, clinching the league title with one match to spare. Høgmo announced his resignation two days after Rosenborg clinched, and Tørum was named permanent coach after the season.

In Ireland, Charlie McGeever was twice appointed caretaker manager of Finn Harps in separate decades (1984–85 and 1995–96) before being given the job on a permanent basis; as permanent manager he led the club to the 1999 FAI Cup Final, which they narrowly lost to an injury time penalty rebound after a three-match marathon.

In Italy, After Juventus fired Claudio Ranieri following a string of seven league games without a win in the 2008–09 season, Ciro Ferrara was named caretaker head coach of Juventus on 18 May 2009 for the remaining two weeks of the season, with the goal of maintaining second place in the league table, and the possibility of being appointed on a full-time basis for a longer period. In his two games as caretaker coach, he led Juventus to 3–0 and 2–0 wins over Siena and Lazio respectively, thus ensuring a second-place finish over rivals Milan. Following these results, he emerged as a strong candidate for to take the job permanently for the next season. On 5 June 2009, Juventus formally announced his appointment as head coach for 2009–10 season. After winning his first four league matches, Ferrara&#x27;s fortunes changed after Juve failed to make the knockout stage of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League following a 4–1 defeat by Bayern Munich at home in a match where a draw would have awarded Juve the qualification to the following phase, despite a promising start to the campaign. Despite a win over Derby d&#x27;Italia rivals Internazionale, Juve embarked on a losing streak over the winter, notably against minor teams such as Sicilian side Catania and recently promoted Bari. Six days later, Juventus were knocked out of the Coppa Italia by Inter 2–1 at the San Siro, leading the board of directors to ultimately sack Ferrara after weeks of speculation regarding his position, replacing him with Alberto Zaccheroni until the end of the season. In 2011–12 season, Inter sacked Claudio Ranieri as head coach and Andrea Stramaccioni was promoted to the first team as caretaker coach, He led Inter to sixth place and a success in the Derby della Madonnina against Milan that cost Inter&#x27;s crosstown rivals the Serie A title; his results led club owner Massimo Moratti to confirm him as head coach for the 2012–13 season, as well. The FIGC allowed Stramaccioni to sign the contract without a UEFA Pro Licence as he was admitted to 2012–13 coaching course in order to obtain the licence in June 2013. On 7 October 2012, Stramaccioni guided Inter to a 1–0 victory over Milan, On 3 November 2012, Stramaccioni guided Inter to a 3–1 away victory over the previous season&#x27;s champions, Juventus. After 14 months in charge of Inter and a difficult 2012–13 Serie A campaign which saw them finish in 9th place and thus fail to qualify for Europe for the first time in 15 seasons, the club announced on 24 May 2013 that Stramaccioni had been sacked and replaced by Walter Mazzarri.

In Spain, On 30 October 2018, Julen Lopetegui was sacked as Real Madrid coach after poor results, with the appointment of Santiago Solari as caretaker coach. After 14 days, Solari was given a permanent contract because in Spain no club was allowed to have a caretaker manager for more than two weeks. Later he was sacked and replaced by former teammate Zinedine Zidane for the second time.

In Germany, On 3 November 2019, Niko Kovač left Bayern Munich by mutual consent after a 5–1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt, his assistant Hansi Flick, promoted as interim coach. In his first match in charge, Bayern defeated Olympiakos 2–0 in the UEFA Champions League group stage on 6 November 2019. In April 2020, Bayern Munich appointed Flick as permanent coach with a contract until 2023. Flick successfully guided Bayern to win the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and UEFA Champions League, thus completing the continental treble for the second time in the club&#x27;s history, the following season, he led Bayern to win the 2020 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla. He also led Bayern to win its first ever sextuple after winning Club World Cup in February 2021 by defeating Mexican team Tigres.

<text>The Butkus Award, instituted in 1985 by the Downtown Athletic Club of Orlando, is given annually to the top linebackers at the high school, collegiate and professional levels of football. The award, named in honor of College Football Hall of Fame and Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker Dick Butkus, is presented by the Butkus Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports a number of health and wellness activities including the &quot;I Play Clean&quot; anti-steroid program. The award was first established by the Downtown Athletic Club of Orlando, which relinquished control of the award in 2008 following a lawsuit by Butkus.

Traditionally, the award was given only to the top collegiate linebacker. The Butkus Award was expanded in 2008 to include high school and professional winners as part of a makeover by the Butkus family to help end anabolic steroid abuse among young athletes. Three players have won both the high school and collegiate Butkus Awards: Notre Dame linebackers Manti Te&#x27;o (2008, 2012) and Jaylon Smith (2012, 2015) and also Georgia linebacker Nakobe Dean (2018, 2021). Four players have won both the collegiate and professional Butkus Awards: San Francisco 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis (2006, 2009), Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller (2010, 2012), Carolina Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly (2011, 2014, 2015, 2017), and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Roquan Smith (2017, 2022, 2023).

<doc id="426828" wikidata="Q957012" url="?curid=426828" title="1994 South African general election">
<text>General elections were held in South Africa between 26 and 29 April 1994. The elections were the first in which citizens of all races were allowed to take part, and were therefore also the first held with universal suffrage. The election was conducted under the direction of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), and marked the culmination of the four-year process that ended apartheid.

Millions queued in lines over a four-day voting period. Altogether, 19,726,579 votes were counted, and 193,081 were rejected as invalid. As widely expected, the African National Congress (ANC), whose slate incorporated the labour confederation COSATU and the South African Communist Party (SACP), won a sweeping victory, taking 62 percent of the vote, just short of the two-thirds majority required to unilaterally amend the Interim Constitution. As required by that document, the ANC formed a Government of National Unity with the National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party, the two other parties that won more than 20 seats in the National Assembly. The governing National Party polled just over 20%, and was thus eligible for a post of Vice President to incumbent president De Klerk. The new National Assembly&#x27;s first act was to elect Nelson Mandela as President, making him the country&#x27;s first black chief executive. He then appointed the Cabinet of Nelson Mandela.

The date 27 April is now a public holiday in South Africa, Freedom Day.

==Background==

===Apartheid===
In 1948, the newly elected National Party government in South Africa began to institute apartheid, an institutionalized system of racial segregation that placed sociopolitical dominance in the hands of the European-descended white minority. Under the Population Registration Act, 1950, all South Africans were categorised by the government as White, Black, Coloured (mixed) or Indian. Suffrage was reserved for Whites, interracial sexual relationships were forbidden and over 80% of the country&#x27;s land was reserved for the white majority. Members of the Black majority were stripped of citizenship under the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, 1970, and were instead made citizens of one of the country&#x27;s &quot;bantustans&quot;, territories reserved for various black ethnic groups. The South African government faced international condemnation against the backdrop of the decolonisation of Africa, and by the 1980s, the state was struggling with major internal political violence, a war of independence in Namibia and intervention in Angola and a failing economy burdened by international sanctions and the heavy costs of national security, effectively forcing the government to move towards political reform. 

In 1983, P. W. Botha&#x27;s government approved a new constitution, which implemented a Tricameral Parliament, with additional houses representing the Coloured and Indian populations. However, Blacks remained unrepresented in parliament, with political representation only existing under the bantustan system. Anti-apartheid groups opposed to the Tricameral Parliament instead reorganized under the umbrella of the United Democratic Front. The 1984 election to the non-white houses of parliament also faced widespread boycotts from Indian and Coloured voters. In 1985, the government introduced a sweeping state of emergency in response to growing civil unrest, which included sweeping restrictions on freedom of movement, freedom of speech and freedom of the press, particularly for non-White South Africans. In 1989, F. W. de Klerk was elected State President of South Africa, succeeding Botha. On 2 February 1990, de Klerk made a speech at the opening of Parliament in Cape Town, in which he unexpectedly announced his intention to unban anti-apartheid groups such as the ANC, SACP and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC), to release political prisoners such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela and requested a process of negotiation with the anti-apartheid opposition. On 11 February, Mandela was released from Victor Verster Prison in Cape Town, after 27 years of incarceration.

===Political transition===
Formal negotiations between the ANC and the government were initially scheduled to begin on 11 April 1990. However on 26 March, police opened fire on protestors in the township of Sebokeng, killing 11 people. Consequently, the ANC cancelled the talks, and negotiations were only rescheduled for 2–4 May following an emergency meeting between Mandela and de Klerk. The &quot;talks about talks&quot; were held at the Groote Schuur presidential estate, and were intended to discuss terms before more substantive constitutional negotiations could begin. The parties jointly agreed to aim to end political violence, and to establish a joint working group. On 6 August, the government and ANC issued a further joint declaration, known as the Pretoria Minute, in which the ANC and its armed wing, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) agreed to the suspension of armed activities, in exchange for the government lifting of the State of Emergency (then only active in Natal Province), further release of political prisoners from September 1990, and a review of certain provisions of the Internal Security Act. On 14 September 1991, 24 organisations signed the National Peace Accord, which included a code of conduct for political parties and security forces, and structures for the resolution of political conflict, such as the Goldstone Commission. 

On 30 November 1991, 19 organisations announced that the first meeting of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) would be held in Johannesburg on 20 and 21 December 1991, in order to discuss constitutional arrangements. The CODESA 1 plenary session saw all participating groups, except for the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the government of the Bophuthatswana homeland, agree to a declaration of intent on establishing a united South Africa with common citizenship for all racial groups, and to promote peaceful political participation so that constitutional change could be advanced. Working groups were established with the aim of forming a constitution-making body, deciding the future of the bantustans, and establishing an interim government within a set time frame. CODESA 1 was not attended by the PAC, Conservative Party (CP) or Azanian People&#x27;s Organisation (AZAPO). Around the same time, de Klerk&#x27;s National Party government faced a series of whites-only by-election losses, leading his government to hold a referendum on 17 March 1992 on the continuation of the negotiation process. The NP and Democratic Party campaigned for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote, while the CP supported the &quot;No&quot; vote. The referendum produced a landslide victory for the government, with 68.3% of voters voting &quot;Yes&quot; for the process to end the apartheid system. 

The second session, CODESA 2, convened at the Kempton Park World Trade Centre on 25 May 1992. The session collapsed following a deadlock on constitutional issues between the ANC and NP. In response to the failure of negotiations, the ANC announced a campaign of &quot;rolling mass action&quot;, encompassing public protests and strikes in order to pressure the government to meet its demands. On 23 June, the ANC announced the suspension of talks after alleging government complicity in a 17 June massacre against residents of the township of Boipatong by supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party. On 7 September, ANC supporters, marching against the government of Oupa Gqozo in the homeland of Ciskei, were opened fire on by the Ciskei Defence Force in the homeland&#x27;s capital, Bhisho, killing 29 people. Despite the massacre often being cited as the impetus for a return to negotiations, the aftermath saw an escalation of political violence in Ciskei.

While negotiations between the ANC and NP had been suspended, unofficial talks were continued from June 1992 without authorization between Cyril Ramaphosa of the ANC and Roelf Meyer of the NP. The talks culminated in the official Record of Understanding between the ANC and the government on the 26 September, recognizing agreements reached between the two in meetings. On 1-2 April 1993, a new multilateral conference, the Multiparty Negotiating Process, was first attended at Kempton Park by 26 different organizations. The only significant absent groups were AZAPO and some Afrikaner nationalist organizations.

In October 1992, the IFP initiated the formation of the Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG) alongside the bantustan governments of Bophuthatswana and Ciskei and the white pro-apartheid Conservative Party, in protest at its alleged sidelining during the negotiation process, and in order to ensure its representation among factions other than the national government and the anti-apartheid opposition. In June 1993, the IFP walked out from the MPNF in protest at the mechanism being used to determine the upcoming election date. Bophuthatswana and Ciskei continued participation until withdrawing in October, upon which COSAG was replaced with the Freedom Alliance, incorporating additional far-right elements. On 17 November 1993, an MPNF plenary meeting endorsed an interim constitution, under which non-racial elections were due to be held on 27 April 1994.

===Conduct===

After initially announcing a boycott due to constitutional disagreements, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) reversed its decision on 19 April, days before the election. It was added to the already-printed ballot papers by means of a sticker. In rural areas with limited infrastructure, people queued &quot;for days&quot; in order to vote.

The Afrikaner nationalist and pro-apartheid Conservative Party, the official opposition in the outgoing National Assembly, did not contest the elections. The similarly aligned Herstigte Nasionale Party, which had run in the white-only elections in 1989 also chose not to run.

==Results==
===National Assembly===
The 400 members of the National Assembly were chosen from party lists in proportion to each party&#x27;s share of the national ballot.

===Senate===
The 90 members of the Senate were chosen, 10 from each province, by the newly elected provincial legislatures. Each province&#x27;s Senate seats were allocated in proportion to the parties&#x27; representation in the provincial legislature.

In 1997, on the adoption of the final Constitution, the Senate became the National Council of Provinces; its political makeup remained the same, but members were divided into permanent and special delegates, as described in the following table.

==Provincial legislature results==
Members of the provincial legislatures were elected from party lists in proportion to each party&#x27;s share of the provincial ballot.

===Eastern Cape===
===Free State===
===Gauteng===
===KwaZulu/Natal===
===Mpumalanga===
===North-West===
===Northern Cape===
===Limpopo===
===Western Cape===
==Legacy==
Following the elections, 27 April subsequently became a national public holiday, Freedom Day.

In a &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; article on the 20th anniversary of the election, Steven Friedman, who headed the IEC&#x27;s information analysis department during the election, stated that the lack of a voters roll made verifying the results of the election difficult, and there were widespread accusations of cheating. Friedman characterised the election as a &quot;technical disaster but a political triumph&quot;, and intimated that the final results were as a result of a negotiated compromise, rather than being an accurate count of the votes cast, stating that it was impossible to produce an accurate result under the circumstances that the election was held. He wrote that he believed that the result of the election, which gave KwaZulu-Natal to the IFP; gave the National Party 20% of the vote share, and a Deputy President position; and held the ANC back from the two-thirds majority with the ability to unilaterally write the final constitution, helped prevent a civil war.

<doc id="426829" wikidata="Q1088064" url="?curid=426829" title="Franz Jakubowski">
<text>Franz Jakubowski (10 June 1912, Posen, Province of Posen, Prussia, Germany, now Poznan, Poland1970, U.S.) was a philosopher and Western Marxist theorist.
==Life==
Born in Prussia, he grew up in what was then the Free City of Danzig. His father was a doctor. From 1930 to 1933 he studied law in Heidelberg, Berlin, Munich and Breslau, before completing his studies in political science at Basel University. After student activism and the agitational role he would briefly play in Danzig, Jakubowski abandoned Europe, and settled in the US, changing his name to Frank Fisher and marrying Margaret Citron with whom he had two children Thomas and Robert Fisher. In the 1970s he moved back to Europe and married Elisabeth Spanjer. There he would play a part in establishing the Alexander Herzen Foundation, a publisher of samizdat soviet literature.

==Contribution to theory==
Jakubowski published his only major work, a book based on his doctoral thesis, in Danzig, 1936. It is entitled &quot;Ideology and Superstructure in Historical Materialism&quot;, and may be seen as an extension to the seminal work of Karl Korsch on the centrality of the Hegelian dialectic to Marxian thought. Jakubowski rehearses for the reader the steps Marx and Engels took away from Hegel, via Feuerbach, to their &#x27;historical materialist&#x27; position. Its unique contribution to Marxian thought is the clarity of its exposition of the relationship between subject and object in Marxian theory.

: &quot;In order to combat a widespread misunderstanding, it must be stressed that the superstructure is real. Lenin in particular tended to overlook this, when he contrasted being and idea in his &#x27;reflection theory&#x27;. The superstructure is no less real than its base. The terms &#x27;reflection&#x27; and &#x27;to reflect&#x27;, which Engels was fond of using when he was discussing ideological superstructure, can be misleading; these terms are meant to indicate something about the &quot;relationship&quot; between base and superstructure, not to &quot;describe&quot; the superstructure itself. There are in fact two forms of reality: the material reality and the &#x27;ideal&#x27; reality (ie, the reality of human ideas). Political and legal superstructure are as real as the base. Both are social relations consisting of human relationships. Both exist in the idea, both are also material realities. As Marx said in &quot;The Holy Family&quot;, &#x27;The communist workers know full well that property, capital, money, wage labour etc. are in no way the mere creations of their imagination but are the extremely concrete and practical results of their own self-alienation&#x27;, and the same is true of non-economic relationships. The reality of social ideas, then, forms a necessary and constituent part of the material reality of social relationships. &quot;Material relations are what they are only in conjunction with the ideas which correspond to them&quot;. The reality of both is expressed by their social efficacy.&quot;

&quot;Ideology and Superstructure&quot; also offered a critique of competing interpretations of Marxian thought, particularly that associated with Karl Kautsky and that with Max Adler.

==Influence==
History has not been kind to Jakubowski. His one contribution is still read in certain small Marxist political currents, and occasionally touches the fringes of academic study, for example, a brief review in the journal &quot;Radical Philosophy&quot; by British philosopher Kate Soper.

<doc id="426831" wikidata="Q890691" url="?curid=426831" title="Multi-link suspension">
<text>A multi-link suspension is a type of independent vehicle suspension having three or more control links per wheel. These arms do not have to be of equal length, and may be angled away from their &quot;obvious&quot; direction. It was first introduced in the late 1960s on the Mercedes-Benz C111 and later on their W201 and W124 series.

Typically each arm has a spherical joint (ball joint) or rubber bushing at each end. Consequently, they react to loads along their own length, in tension and compression, but not in bending. Some multi-links do use a trailing arm, control arm or wishbone, which has two bushings at one end.

On a front suspension one of the lateral arms is replaced by the tie-rod, which connects the rack or steering box to the wheel hub.
==Layout==
In order to simplify understanding, it is usual to consider the function of the arms in each of three orthogonal planes:

*Top view:
The arms have to control toe/steer and lateral compliance. This needs a pair of arms longitudinally separated.

*Front view:
The arms have to control camber, particularly the way that the camber changes as the wheel moves up (into jounce, or bump) and down into rebound or droop.

*Side view:
The arms have to transmit traction and braking loads, usually accomplished via a longitudinal link. They also have to control caster. Note that brake torques also have to be reacted - either by a second longitudinal link, or by rotating the hub, which forces the lateral arms out of plane, so allowing them to react &#x27;spin&#x27; forces, or by rigidly fixing the longitudinal link to the hub.
==Advantages==
Multi-link suspension allows the auto designer the ability to incorporate both good ride and good handling in the same vehicle.

In its simplest form, the multi-link suspension is orthogonal—i.e., it is possible to alter one parameter in the suspension at a time without affecting anything else. This is in direct contrast to a double wishbone suspension, where moving a hardpoint or changing a bushing compliance will affect two or more parameters.

The benefit of the triangulated and double-triangulated arrangement is that they do not need a Panhard rod. The benefits of this are increased articulation and potential ease of installation.

==Disadvantages==
Multilink suspension is costly and complex. It is also difficult to tune the geometry without a full 3D computer aided design analysis. Compliance under load can have an important effect and must be checked using a multibody simulation software.

<doc id="426833" wikidata="Q15284139" url="?curid=426833" title="Captain Harlock">
<text>is a fictional character and the protagonist of the &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot; manga series created by Leiji Matsumoto.

Harlock is the archetypical Romantic hero, a space pirate with an individualist philosophy of life. He is as noble as he is taciturn, rebellious, stoically fighting against totalitarian regimes, whether they be Earth-born or alien. In his own words, he &quot;fight[s] for no one&#x27;s sake... only for something deep in [his] heart&quot;. He does not fear death, and is sometimes seen wearing clothing with the number 42 on it. In Japanese culture, the number 42 is associated with death (the numbers, pronounced separately as &quot;four two&quot;, sound like the word &quot;shini&quot;—meaning &quot;dying/death&quot;). He is a descendant of the Harlock clan, an ancient Germanic clan of pirate-knights based in Heiligenstadt.

The character was created by Leiji Matsumoto in 1977 and popularized in the 1978 television series &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot;. Since then, the character has appeared in numerous animated television series and films, the latest of which is 2013&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

==History==
Though there are slight variations in each telling of Harlock&#x27;s story, the essentials remain the same. Matsumoto presents a future (2977 AD) in which the Earth has achieved a vast starfaring civilization, but is slowly and steadily succumbing to ennui or despair, often due to defeat and subjugation by a foreign invader. Rising against the general apathy, Harlock denies defeat and leads an outlaw crew aboard his starship &quot;Arcadia&quot; to undertake daring raids against Earth&#x27;s oppressors. Even though they have defeated Earth and devastated its peoples, the invaders are often presented in a sympathetic light, being shown as having some justification for their actions.

===&quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot; (1978 TV series)===
In &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot;, the Captain&#x27;s crew included the mysterious, alcohol-imbibing alien woman Miime, a robot, and a drunken doctor. The series presented a story arc in which a huge black metal sphere strikes Tokyo and ancient Mayan legends appear to be walking the Earth again. The invaders turn out to be the Mazone, a race of plant-based women who explored Earth in the mythic past and are now back to reclaim it. Only Harlock and his mismatched crew are brave and capable enough to face the enemy.

===&quot;Captain Harlock – Mystery of the Arcadia&quot;===
This 1978 short film is ostensibly a retelling of episode 13 of the 1978 series, &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Ocean Castle of Death&quot;. It consists primarily of recycled footage taken from this same episode, but presented in widescreen format. Some new alternate footage is added at the beginning of the story, and some soundtrack adjustments were made throughout.

===&quot;Arcadia of My Youth&quot;===
The &quot;Arcadia of My Youth&quot; feature film was released on July 28, 1982. The film, set in a different continuity from the original TV series, chronicles Harlock&#x27;s beginnings as a space pirate and his acquisition of the spaceship &quot;Arcadia&quot;. The film also includes flashback material dealing with two of his 20th-century ancestors.

===&quot;Endless Orbit SSX&quot;===
&quot;Arcadia of My Youth&quot; was followed by 22 episodes of the TV series &quot;Endless Orbit SSX&quot; starting in October 1982. Its official French title is simply &quot;Albator&quot;, although it early became popular among French speakers as &quot;Albator 84&quot; since it was first aired in France as of 1984 and the 1978 series had been formerly named in French exactly the same: &quot;Albator&quot;. The series dealt with Harlock and company&#x27;s continuing struggle against the Illumidas occupying force, who still retained control of Earth at the end of the theatrical feature. Both film (&quot;Arcadia of My Youth&quot;) and second series (&quot;Endless Orbit SSX&quot;) feature a newly designed starship and lack most of the crew from the &quot;Space Pirate&quot; series, but are noteworthy for the presence of Emeraldas, a female counterpart to Harlock who originally appeared in a series of Matsumoto-penned graphic novels.

===&quot;Harlock Saga&quot;===
In the 1990s, Matsumoto released &quot;Harlock Saga&quot;, a mini-series based on &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;. The series recasts the Captain and his crew in roles with analogues in The Ring Cycle and pits them against a race of &quot;gods&quot; set on redesigning the universe to their liking.

===&quot;Gun Frontier&quot;===
&quot;Gun Frontier&quot;, a buddy comedy set in the American Old West, began broadcasting in TV Tokyo on March 28, 2002. The series follows Franklin Harlock Jr. and Tochiro Ōyama as they search for a lost clan of Japanese immigrants. In contrast to other works, Harlock appears here as Tochiro&#x27;s sidekick.

===&quot;Endless Odyssey&quot;===
December 2002 saw the release of &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock: The Endless Odyssey&quot;, directed by Rintaro.

The story is set after the original TV series, with Harlock on a self-imposed exile and his crew either in jail or flying under the Jolly Roger. The series details Harlock&#x27;s return and his round-up of the &quot;Arcadia&quot; crew for a fight against the Noo, a mysterious and ancient evil which has caused the Earth to disappear, and who use fear to conquer their foes. As nearly every part of this series is geared to be a sequel to the original &quot;Captain Harlock&quot; TV series, &quot;Endless Odyssey&quot; reintroduces Tadashi Daiba to the &quot;Arcadia&quot;.

===&quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot; (2013 film)===

Toei Animation produced a film adaptation of the manga in 2013, titled &quot;&quot;. Toei developed the pilot for its planned computer-graphics remake of &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot; manga and anime franchise in 2010. &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; UC author Harutoshi Fukui, &quot;Appleseed&quot; director Shinji Aramaki, &quot;Appleseed&quot; mechanical designer Atsushi Takeuchi, and &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; character designer Yutaka Minowa worked on the new &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot; pilot with Marza Animation Planet (formerly known as Sega Sammy Visual Entertainment). The official trailer/pilot was aired at the Kawaii-Kon Anime festival in Hawaii on April 17 of the same year, as a special presentation courtesy of director Shinji Aramaki. The film has the highest production budget ever at the equivalent of over 30 million U.S. dollars.

The film premiered in Japan on September 7, 2013. The film also premiered on Netflix under the title &quot;Harlock: Space Pirate&quot; with Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish audio and with English, Portuguese and Spanish subtitles, with some scenes cut from some versions.

===&quot;Captain Harlock: Dimensional Voyage&quot;===
In August 2014, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of his debut, Matsumoto launched the manga &quot;Captain Harlock: Dimensional Voyage&quot;, illustrated by Kōichi Shimahoshi, in the pages of Akita Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Champion Red&quot; magazine. &quot;Dimensional Voyage&quot; is a retelling of the original 1978 &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot; manga.

==Reception and cultural impact==
Harlock has achieved notable popularity. In 1979, the character won the first annual Anime Grand Prix for favorite character. In 2006, Harlock and the characters of &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; were recognized in the third set of &quot;Anime Heroes and Heroines&quot; stamps. Harlock was ranked fourth in Mania Entertainment&#x27;s 10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes written by Thomas Zoth who commented that &quot;as befitting his archetype status, Harlock has inspired many other manga and anime characters with his strong, stoic appearance and manner&quot;.

Several anime and manga characters have been, in some way, inspired by Matsumoto&#x27;s creation. Naoko Takeuchi drew inspiration from Harlock&#x27;s stoic qualities (&quot;strong, silent, unshakeable&quot;) when designing the character of Tuxedo Mask, while &quot;Last Exile&quot;″s Alex Row was modeled after the Captain. His basic character design is even thought to be a source of inspiration for Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s manga character Black Jack. A parody of Harlock also appears in &quot;Project A-ko&quot;.

==Adaptations in other media==
* In France, where the anime was very popular, but renamed &quot;Albator&quot; to avoid mix-ups with Captain Haddock, in the early 1980s, a local comic series in album format was produced by writer Claude Moliterni and anonymous artists of Studio Five Stars.
* Eternity Comics, an imprint of Malibu Comics, produced an American comic book series based on &quot;Captain Harlock&quot;. It was written by Robert W. Gibson and illustrated by Ben Dunn and Tim Eldred. The storyline allegedly started two years after the events in &quot;Arcadia of My Youth&quot; but ignores the events in &quot;Endless Road SSX&quot; while still borrowing elements from them. The comics discontinued in 1992 after it was discovered that Malibu did not have the rights to use &quot;Captain Harlock&quot;. Reportedly, the alleged representative for the rights to &quot;Harlock&quot; with whom Malibu exchanged money turned out to be fraudulent and was in no way connected to the rights holders.
* In April 2008, Eight Peaks, a South Korean production company, announced that it had signed a joint production contract with Japan&#x27;s Genome Entertainment to produce a live-action film based on Captain Harlock. Original creator Leiji Matsumoto expressed concern with the project, as neither company had approached him for consent to make the film.

===Other appearances===
* Captain Harlock, or characters indistinguishable from him, have made frequent &quot;unbilled cameo&quot; appearances in many other works of Leiji Matsumoto, including &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;, &quot;Queen Emeraldas&quot;, and &quot;Galaxy Railways&quot; as the joker in a deck of playing cards.
* Captain Harlock was originally intended to appear in &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; during their return voyage from Iscandar. The idea was dropped for a number of reasons which probably included the fact that the rights to &quot;Yamato&quot; were at the time owned by executive producer Yoshinobu Nishizaki. This idea evolved into simply finding Mamoru Kodai (Alex Wildstar) alive on Iscandar. The idea was still used later in a &quot;Yamato&quot; manga by Matsumoto where Yamato later encounters Mamoru who assumed the false identity of Captain Harlock (as revealed when hero Susumu Kodai finds a copy of a &quot;Captain Harlock&quot; manga among his supposedly dead brother&#x27;s belongings).
* In 2001, &quot;Cosmo Warrior Zero&quot; presented a version of the story in which Captain Zero, a human veteran of the Earth-Mechanized War, is commanded by the Machine Men, who won the war and now rule Earth, to hunt down the Space Pirate who is still resisting the invaders. This series focuses on Zero and his misfit crew as they take on the hopeless mission, fighting a more skilled enemy who also may be more justified in his actions than they are. Harlock, Tochiro and Emeraldas put in mostly supporting guest appearances, and are shown as being slightly younger than their previous incarnations.
* In the &quot;Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay&quot; tabletop games, the legendary Rogue Trader Solomon Haarlock is presumably named after Captain Harlock and Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Solomon Kane. Another member of the Haarlock Dynasty, Erasmus Haarlock, bears a number of physical similarities to Captain Harlock: The long, wild hair, a missing right eye (a cybernetic replacement rather than just an eyepatch) and scars around his left eye.
* In the episode &quot;Space Booty&quot; of &quot;Megas XLR&quot;, the villain is a parody of Harlock, his name even being Warlock. He invites Coop. Kiva, and Jamie onto his ship and tries to convince Kiva to stay with him and forget about her two friends.
* Glenn Danzig would often wear a Captain Harlock skull and crossbones T-shirt when he played in The Misfits.
* In the cartoon series &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, the character Lars Barriga takes up an appearance and role inspired by Captain Harlock in the season five episode &quot;Lars of the Stars&quot;.
* In the penultimate episode of the anime series &quot;Magical Project S&quot;, also known as Pretty Sammy TV, the magical girl, Pixy Misa is seen cosplaying as Captain Harlock while she was piloting NASA&#x27;s Endeavour shuttle with a rudder as she was flying towards the Magic Kingdom of Jurailhelm, all while mimicking the famous captain.

<text>The Treaty of Alton was an agreement signed in 1101 between Henry Beauclerc and his older brother Robert Curthose in which Robert agreed to recognize Henry as the king of England in exchange for a yearly stipend and other concessions. The agreement temporarily ended a crisis in the succession of the Anglo-Norman kings.

King William II of England died in a hunting accident in 1100. His elder brother, Robert Curthose, had at one point been acknowledged as his heir presumptive. Robert&#x27;s absence in the First Crusade at the time of William&#x27;s death, as well as his poor reputation among the Anglo-Norman barons, allowed the youngest brother, Henry Beauclerc, to claim the throne with popular support. Robert returned from the Holy Land after Henry&#x27;s coronation. Encouraged by his advisor Ranulf Flambard, he invaded the Kingdom of England in order to claim the throne. He landed secretly at Portsmouth and was met by Henry at the town of Alton. Henry had solidified his popularity with the nobles and the Church by his issuance of the Charter of Liberties, however, and his popularity allowed him to resist Robert&#x27;s invasion.

The dispute was settled diplomatically. In the Treaty of Alton, Robert agreed to renounce his claim to the English throne in exchange for a yearly stipend of 3,000 marks and the concession of all but one of Henry&#x27;s possessions in the Duchy of Normandy. Robert and his followers were allowed to return to Normandy without reprisal from Henry. The two brothers moreover agreed to name each other as heirs and to assist each other in the punishment of traitors. The agreement was not long-lasting. In 1105, Henry invaded Normandy and defeated his brother&#x27;s army the following year at the Battle of Tinchebray. Robert was imprisoned and died in captivity in 1134. Normandy remained a possession of the English crown for over a century afterwards.

<text>TV4 [[Aktiebolag|AB]] (formerly Nordisk Television AB; previously traded as ) is a Swedish media company owned by Telia Company through TV4 Media (formerly known as Bonnier Broadcasting). The company owns the largest commercial television channel in Sweden, TV4.

From 2007 until 2019, TV4 AB was owned by Bonnier, with Bonnier Broadcasting AB being its parent since 2016. The stock used to be traded at the Stockholm Stock Exchange (OM), but was removed from the OM when Bonnier took full control of the company.

On 20 July 2018, Telia Company announced the acquisition proposal of the Bonnier Broadcasting, which includes this company, for 9.2 billion SEK (roughly US$1 billion). The acquisition was completed on December 2, 2019.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1984 by Ingemar Leijonborg and Gunnar Bergvall as &quot;Nordisk Television AB&quot; (&quot;Nordic Television&quot;). They intended to start a Swedish commercial television channel.

It took several years for Leijonborg and Bergvall to find someone willing to invest in their channel, but it was eventually launched on September 15, 1990 as &quot;TV4&quot;, broadcasting from the Tele-X satellite. A Norwegian sister channel, TV4 Norway, was also launched, but was sold a few years later.

At the time, it was clear that the government intended to launch a third terrestrial station and that it would be commercially funded. The two main competitors for the new channel were Nordisk Television and Kinnevik (owners of TV3). Eventually it was Nordisk Television who got the license since Kinnevik agreed to withdraw their application. In exchange, Kinnevik bought 30 percent of Nordisk Television and a company called Airtime AB was set up to sell advertising in TV3 and TV4, giving Kinnevik control of almost all television advertising in Sweden. TV4 could start broadcasting terrestrially in the spring of 1992. Nordisk Television discontinued the Airtime agreement in 1993, a decision followed by years of discussion between Kinnevik and the other owners of the company.

Nordisk Television started trading on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1994 and changed its legal name to &quot;TV4 AB&quot;.

With the terrestrial license followed an obligation to give some airtime to different local companies. This would regularly be owned by the TV4 Group in conjunction with local investors and media companies. With the start of TV4 Uppland the number of regional stations reached sixteen. Eventually, the TV4 Group started buying local stations and in 2001 they owned all but one, TV4 Fyrstad, which went bankrupt in 2003. The TV4 Group then merged all regional stations into a single entity, &quot;TV4 Sverige AB&quot;.

TV4 started broadcasting in the digital terrestrial television network in 1999. In 2001, the TV4 Group started an experimental interactive channel called Mediteve using the space on the digital multiplex. In 2003, a general entertainment channel called TV4 Plus was started. It was followed by TV4 Film in 2004, and TV400 and TV4 Fakta in 2005.

For several years, the TV channels of the TV4 AB wasn&#x27;t a part of Kinnevik&#x27;s digital satellite platform Viasat. However, in April 2005, TV4 Plus, TV4 Film and TV400 were launched on Viasat (the TV4 Group channel had to wait until 2006 due to contracts with the Canal Digital platform).

In the digital television franchise round of 2006, the TV4 Group applied for three new digital channels, but none of them were given a license. They did however launch two new channels in November 2006: TV4 Komedi and TV4 Guld.

In May 2006, the TV4 AB bought 51 percent of the sports channel Sport-Expressen from the newspaper Expressen. The ownership was increased to 66.2 percent in May 2007 and the channel was relaunched as TV4 Sport in September 2007.

In November 2006, it was announced that Bonnier and Proventus would buy the share in the TV4&#x27;s operating company that was then held by Schibsted. The deal was approved in December 2006, making the TV4 almost entirely owned by Nordic Broadcasting Oy, a company owned jointly by Bonnier and Proventus. Proventus sold its shares in Nordic Broadcasting to Bonnier in March 2007, making it a fully owned subsidiary of Bonnier.
In early 2008, the company adopted its trade name, ().

<text>An adder, or summer, is a digital circuit that performs addition of numbers. In many computers and other kinds of processors, adders are used in the arithmetic logic units (ALUs). They are also used in other parts of the processor, where they are used to calculate addresses, table indices, increment and decrement operators and similar operations.

Although adders can be constructed for many number representations, such as binary-coded decimal or excess-3, the most common adders operate on binary numbers.
In cases where two&#x27;s complement or ones&#x27; complement is being used to represent negative numbers, it is trivial to modify an adder into an adder–subtractor.
Other signed number representations require more logic around the basic adder.

==History==
George Stibitz invented the 2-bit binary adder (the Model K) in 1937.

==Binary adders==

===Half adder===
The half adder adds two single binary digits formula_1 and formula_2. It has two outputs, sum (formula_3) and carry (formula_4). The carry signal represents an overflow into the next digit of a multi-digit addition. The value of the sum is formula_5. The simplest half-adder design, pictured on the right, incorporates an XOR gate for formula_3 and an AND gate for formula_4. The Boolean logic for the sum (in this case formula_3) will be formula_9 whereas for the carry (formula_4) will be formula_11. With the addition of an OR gate to combine their carry outputs, two half adders can be combined to make a full adder.

The truth table for the half adder is:

Various half adder digital logic circuits:
===Full adder===
A full adder adds binary numbers and accounts for values carried in as well as out. A one-bit full-adder adds three one-bit numbers, often written as formula_1, formula_2, and formula_14; formula_1 and formula_2 are the operands, and formula_14 is a bit carried in from the previous less-significant stage. The circuit produces a two-bit output. Output carry and sum are typically represented by the signals formula_18 and formula_3, where the sum equals formula_20. The full adder is usually a component in a cascade of adders, which add 8, 16, 32, etc. bit binary numbers.

A full adder can be implemented in many different ways such as with a custom transistor-level circuit or composed of other gates. The most common implementation is with:

:formula_21
:formula_22

The above expressions for formula_3 and formula_14 can be derived from using a Karnaugh map to simplify the truth table.

In this implementation, the final OR gate before the carry-out output may be replaced by an XOR gate without altering the resulting logic. This is because when A and B are both 1, the term formula_25 is always 0, and hence formula_26 can only be 0. Thus, the inputs to the final OR gate can never be both 1&#x27;s (this is the only combination for which the OR and XOR outputs differ).

Due to the functional completeness property of the NAND and NOR gates, a full adder can also be implemented using nine NAND gates, or nine NOR gates.

Using only two types of gates is convenient if the circuit is being implemented using simple integrated circuit chips which contain only one gate type per chip.

A full adder can also be constructed from two half adders by connecting formula_1 and formula_2 to the input of one half adder, then taking its sum-output formula_3 as one of the inputs to the second half adder and formula_14 as its other input, and finally the carry outputs from the two half-adders are connected to an OR gate. The sum-output from the second half adder is the final sum output (formula_3) of the full adder and the output from the OR gate is the final carry output (formula_18). The critical path of a full adder runs through both XOR gates and ends at the sum bit formula_3. Assumed that an XOR gate takes 1 delays to complete, the delay imposed by the critical path of a full adder is equal to:

:formula_34

The critical path of a carry runs through one XOR gate in adder and through 2 gates (AND and OR) in carry-block and therefore, if AND or OR gates take 1 delay to complete, has a delay of:

:formula_35

The truth table for the full adder is:
Inverting all inputs of a full adder also inverts all of its outputs, which can be used in the design of fast ripple-carry adders, because there is no need to invert the carry.

Various full adder digital logic circuits:
===Adders supporting multiple bits===
====Ripple-carry adder====

It is possible to create a logical circuit using multiple full adders to add &quot;N&quot;-bit numbers. Each full adder inputs a formula_14, which is the formula_18 of the previous adder. This kind of adder is called a ripple-carry adder (RCA), since each carry bit &quot;ripples&quot; to the next full adder. The first (and only the first) full adder may be replaced by a half adder (under the assumption that formula_38).

The layout of a ripple-carry adder is simple, which allows fast design time; however, the ripple-carry adder is relatively slow, since each full adder must wait for the carry bit to be calculated from the previous full adder. The gate delay can easily be calculated by inspection of the full adder circuit. Each full adder requires three levels of logic. In a 32-bit ripple-carry adder, there are 32 full adders, so the critical path (worst case) delay is 3 (from input to carry in first adder) + 31 × 2 (for carry propagation in latter adders) = 65 gate delays.
The general equation for the worst-case delay for a &quot;n&quot;-bit carry-ripple adder, accounting for both the sum and carry bits, is:

:formula_39formula_40formula_41

A design with alternating carry polarities and optimized AND-OR-Invert gates can be about twice as fast.

====Carry-lookahead adder (Weinberger and Smith, 1958)====

To reduce the computation time, Weinberger and Smith invented a faster way to add two binary numbers by using carry-lookahead adders (CLA). They introduced two signals (formula_42 and formula_43) for each bit position, based on whether a carry is propagated through from a less significant bit position (at least one input is a 1), generated in that bit position (both inputs are 1), or killed in that bit position (both inputs are 0). In most cases, formula_42 is simply the sum output of a half adder and formula_43 is the carry output of the same adder. After formula_42 and formula_43 are generated, the carries for every bit position are created.

Mere derivation of Weinberger-Smith CLA recurrence, are: Brent–Kung adder (BKA), and the Kogge–Stone adder (KSA).
This was shown in Oklobdzija and Zeydel paper in IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circutis.

Some other multi-bit adder architectures break the adder into blocks. It is possible to vary the length of these blocks based on the propagation delay of the circuits to optimize computation time. These block based adders include the carry-skip (or carry-bypass) adder which will determine formula_42 and formula_43 values for each block rather than each bit, and the carry-select adder which pre-generates the sum and carry values for either possible carry input (0 or 1) to the block, using multiplexers to select the appropriate result &quot;when&quot; the carry bit is known.

By combining multiple carry-lookahead adders, even larger adders can be created. This can be used at multiple levels to make even larger adders. For example, the following adder is a 64-bit adder that uses four 16-bit CLAs with two levels of lookahead carry units.

Other adder designs include the carry-select adder, conditional sum adder, carry-skip adder, and carry-complete adder.

====Carry-save adders====
If an adding circuit is to compute the sum of three or more numbers, it can be advantageous to not propagate the carry result. Instead, three-input adders are used, generating two results: a sum and a carry. The sum and the carry may be fed into two inputs of the subsequent 3-number adder without having to wait for propagation of a carry signal. After all stages of addition, however, a conventional adder (such as the ripple-carry or the lookahead) must be used to combine the final sum and carry results.

===3:2 compressors===
A full adder can be viewed as a &quot;3:2 lossy compressor&quot;: it sums three one-bit inputs and returns the result as a single two-bit number; that is, it maps 8 input values to 4 output values. (the term &quot;compressor&quot; instead of &quot;counter&quot; was introduced in)Thus, for example, a binary input of 101 results in an output of (decimal number 2). The carry-out represents bit one of the result, while the sum represents bit zero. Likewise, a half adder can be used as a &quot;2:2 lossy compressor&quot;, compressing four possible inputs into three possible outputs.

Such compressors can be used to speed up the summation of three or more addends. If the number of addends is exactly three, the layout is known as the carry-save adder. If the number of addends is four or more, more than one layer of compressors is necessary, and there are various possible designs for the circuit: the most common are Dadda and Wallace trees. This kind of circuit is most notably used in multiplier circuits, which is why these circuits are also known as Dadda and Wallace multipliers.

== Quantum adders ==
 Using only the Toffoli and CNOT quantum logic gates, it is possible to produce quantum full- and half-adders. The same circuits can also be implemented in classical reversible computation, as both CNOT and Toffoli are also classical logic gates.

Since the quantum Fourier transform has a low circuit complexity, it can efficiently be used for adding numbers as well.

== Analog adders ==
Just as in Binary adders, combining two input currents effectively adds those currents together. Within the constraints of the hardware, non-binary signals (i.e. with a base higher than 2) can be added together to calculate a sum. Also known as a &quot;summing amplifier&quot;, this technique can be used to reduce the number of transistors in an addition circuit.

<text>USS &quot;S-51&quot; (SS-162) was a fourth-group (&quot;S-48&quot;) S-class submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;S-51&quot;′s keel was laid down on 22 December 1919 by the Lake Torpedo Boat Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut. She was launched on 20 August 1921, sponsored by Mrs. R. J. Mills, and commissioned on 24 June 1922.

==Operations==
The new submarine was based at New London, Connecticut on 1 July 1922 as a unit of Submarine Division 4 (SubDiv 4) and followed a normal peacetime training cycle, operating out of her home port with visits to Newport, Rhode Island, and Providence, Rhode Island. She departed from New York City on 4 January 1924 for the Panama Canal Zone to participate in winter fleet maneuvers off Panama and in the Caribbean Sea. During this cruise, she visited Trinidad, Guantanamo Bay, Culebra, and St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. After returning to New York City on 30 April, she resumed type training off Block Island and in New England coastal waters.

==Sinking==
On the night of 25 September 1925, &quot;S-51&quot; was operating on the surface near Block Island, with her running lights on. The merchant steamer &quot;City of Rome&quot; spotted a single white masthead light but was unable to determine its course, speed, or intentions. The ship altered her course away from the unknown light to give whatever it might be greater leeway. Meanwhile, &quot;S-51&quot; spotted the ship&#x27;s masthead and green sidelights and held her course as she was required to do by the Rules of the Road then in effect. Shortly after altering course, &quot;City of Rome&quot; spotted the submarine&#x27;s red sidelight and realized that they were on collision courses. She turned and backed her engines, but it was too late. Twenty-two minutes after first spotting the submarine&#x27;s masthead light, the steamer rammed her at the position .

Only three of the 36 men in the submarine (Dewey G. Kile, Michael E. Lira, and Alfred Geier) were able to abandon ship before she sank.

The courts found &quot;City of Rome&quot; at fault for not reducing her speed when in doubt as to the movement of &quot;S-51&quot; and for not signaling her change of course. However, both the district court and the Circuit Court of Appeals found &quot;S-51&quot; at fault for having improper lights.

The United States Navy argued that it was not practicable to have submarines of this class comply with the letter of the law and that, as a special type of warship, &quot;S-51&quot; was under no legal compulsion to do so. The court responded by saying if these statements were correct, then submarines &quot;should confine their operation to waters not being traversed by other ships.&quot;

==Salvage==
&quot;S-51&quot; was raised on 5 July 1926 by a team led by then-Lieutenant Commander Edward Ellsberg with Lieutenant Henry Hartley assisting (both reached the rank of Rear Admiral). The entire salvage operation was commanded by Captain (later Fleet Admiral) Ernest J. King. While being towed to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, she ran aground on Man-o&#x27;-War Reef in the East River on 8 July 1926. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 January 1930 and sold for scrap on 23 June to the Borough Metal Company of Brooklyn, New York. &quot;S-51&quot;&#x27;s bell was removed and taken to the Submarine Force Library and Museum at Groton, Connecticut.

==In Culture==
The sinking of USS S-51 is memorialized in the popular song, &quot;Sinking of the Submarine S-51,&quot; by Maggie Andrews. For solo guitar and mouth harp accompaniment, the song was recorded by tenor Al Craver (pseudonym for Vernon Dalhart) on Columbia 78 RPM record 15044-D (141099), on October 9, 1925.

<text>Albert Roger Miller (born 20 May 1952), known as Roger Milla, is a Cameroonian former professional footballer who played as a forward. He was one of the first African players to be a major star on the international stage. He played in three World Cups for the Cameroon national team.

He achieved international stardom at 38 years old, an age at which most forwards have retired, by scoring four goals at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and thus becoming the oldest goalscorer in World Cup history. He helped Cameroon become the first African team to reach the World Cup quarter-finals. Four years later, at the age of 42, Milla broke his own record as the oldest goalscorer in World Cup by scoring against Russia in the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

Milla frequently celebrated goals by running to the corner flag and performing a dance similar to the lambada. In 2004 he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players. In 2007, the Confederation of African Football named Milla the best African player of the previous 50 years. At the time of his retirement, he was regarded as the all-time topscorer from African region in FIFA World Cup finals with five goals and his record was eventually surpassed by Ghana&#x27;s Asamoah Gyan.

== Biography ==
His birth certificate as well as his passport implies his name as Roger Miller due to a clerical error and misunderstanding. His parents wanted to give him the surname of his uncle &#x27;Milla&#x27; by the time he was born. He was often referred to as Miller whenever he featured in high-profile international matches with World Cup statistical sheets referring to him as Miller speaks volume of how far his name had been mispronounced and wrongly heard in international community. His family moved to Douala when he was 11.

His father worked on the railroads and Milla had the fortune of travelling all over the nation on many occasions in his childhood. He was raised up in the streets of Yaoundé and he hailed from a typical middle-class family so that his parents were able to provide him a satisfactory education. However, his parents were unhappy when they noticed that Milla was going after football and they were initially reluctant to accept their son playing the sport of football.

He learnt the art of playing football by playing barefoot with fellow kids on dirt streets and roads and in most of the occasions he played with an orange or a tin can as an alternate option for a ball. He also had the habit of kicking lemons and rags tied together into balls. He along with other children had to play in dusty courts since Cameroon had not yet established children soccer academies at that time and Cameroon did not have the luxury of well maintained fields nor did they afford to have licensed coaches. It was revealed that Milla played football solely for leisure, fun and entertainment purposes and did not think seriously of making it as his career and he went onto polish his football skills during school vacations.

Roger Milla himself said that he had finished high school but his claim has been refuted by some Cameroonian writers. He has three brothers with different surnames such as Joseph Debouba, Jacques Edjanque and Alexandre Diboussi. He nearly quit the sport after his mother&#x27;s untimely death at home during the time when he played soccer in a distant arena and also due to his wife had become pregnant as the couple were awaiting for their second child.

==Club career==
===Early years===
He played for Eclair de Douala&#x27;s junior team at the age of 13 and engaged exclusively in school tournaments. He later convinced his parents following his impressive performances in age group category matches.

He made his debut for Eclair de Douala&#x27;s senior team in the second division of the Cameroonian championship at the age of 15. Two years later, aged 17, he became the Cameroonian schools high jump champion. He signed up for the top division club Léopard Douala in 1970 at the age of 18 and eventually went onto win three Cameroonian championship titles with the club. He also scored a tally of 89 goals in 116 appearances for Léopard Douala during a tenure of four years. He subsequently moved to Tonnerre Yaoundé in 1974 four years after the successful stint with Léopard Douala. He won the African Cup Winners&#x27; Cup with Tonnerre Yaoundé and for Tonnerre Yaoundé club he scored 69 goals in 87 games.

===Moving to France===
He moved to France at the age of 25 in 1977 where he spent 12 years of his career playing for various clubs. In 1977, he was lured to Europe by the French club Valenciennes. There he scored 6 goals in 28 league games over two seasons. In 1979, he joined AS Monaco, where he won the 1980 French Cup and scored 5 goals in 25 league and cup games. He had endured multiple injury concerns during his short stay and his team management decided to release him at the end of the season. The next year, he joined Bastia, where he spent four seasons. Milla scored 42 goals in 133 competitive matches and was instrumental in assisting the club to win the 1981 French Cup.

He next moved to Saint-Etienne in 1984 and became a crucial member of the club, which was recovering from the aftermath of a massive bribery scandal in 1982 and the subsequent relegation to Division 2, having had to sell out most of its first-choice players. He overall played 69 matches for the club scoring 36 goals and played a part in helping the club to re-enter the first division. He then starred for Montpellier from 1986 to 1989, where Milla later went on to become a member of the club&#x27;s coaching staff after retiring from French football. In his first season, Milla scored 18 goals in 33 regular season matches, which ultimately helped the Montpellier to return to Division 1. Overall, he scored 41 goals in 103 appearances for the Montpellier.

===Later years===
Milla left French football at the age of 37 in 1989 and moved to Réunion in the Indian Ocean where he played for JS Saint-Pierroise. After his World Cup success, he returned to Tonnerre in Cameroon for four seasons. He closed out his playing days with two clubs in Indonesia after the 1994 World Cup, retiring from the sport at the end of the 1996 season. The number of goals he had scored in the Indonesian local championship surpassed the number of matches he had even played in the competition, with 41 goals coming in just 35 matches over a period of two years.

==International career==
Milla was capped 77 times for the national team, scoring 43 goals. Milla made his first appearance for Cameroon in 1973 versus Zaire in a World Cup qualifier.

He made his World Cup debut in also what is considered to be the maiden World Cup appearance for Cameroon when they qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup after winning both their final round matches against Morocco at the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification for the African Zone. Milla played an instrumental role in helping Cameroon to qualify for the 1982 World Cup by top scoring in the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification for the African Zone competition. He endured mixed emotions at 1982 FIFA World Cup having a goal disallowed against Peru in their first match. Cameroon went out with three draws from their three first-round games. Two years later, he was part of the squad competing at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California.

Milla was also an integral member of the Cameroonian squad which won the 1984 African Cup of Nations where Cameroon defeated Nigeria 3-1 in the final to secure Cameroon&#x27;s first ever continental title. He was a key member of the Cameroonian side which emerged as runners-up to Egypt in the final of the 1986 African Cup of Nations and he received the best player award in the tournament for being the top goal scorer with 4. He was also named in 1986 African Cup of Nations team of the tournament. He was also the joint top goalscorer in the 1988 African Cup of Nations with 2 goals alongside Algeria&#x27;s Lakhdar Belloumi, Abdoulaye Traoré of Ivory Coast and Gamal Abdelhamid of Egypt. He once again played a vital role in Cameroon&#x27;s trumph at the 1988 African Cup of Nations and for his noteworthy performances throughout the tournament, he was adjudged as the player of the tournament and was also included in the 1988 African Cup of Nations team of the tournament.

In 1988, at the age of 36, Milla celebrated his early retirement from international football with a jubilee in Cameroon. However, in 1990, he received a phone call from the President of Cameroon Paul Biya, who pleaded with him to come out of international retirement and rejoin the national team. He agreed, and went to Italy with the &quot;Indomitable Lions&quot; for the 1990 World Cup, where he would cause a sensation. It was revealed that Paul Biya wanted Milla to play in the World Cup after watching Milla play in an exhibition charity match which was played at Douala where Milla went on to score two goals. Following the insistence of the Cameroonian President, Milla decided to make a comeback to international football by making an official announcement in May 1990.

It is also reported that most of the Cameroonian teammates and the national head coach Valery Nepomnyashchy who is a Russian did not want Milla to be part of the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Biya issued a decree summoning him to return to the national side and Biya officially signed the decree requesting and compelling the coach to pick him for the World Cup squad. It was also reported that the renowned sportswriters in Cameroon along with fans began a campaign to recall Milla back to the national team following Cameroon&#x27;s embarrassing display during the 1990 African Cup of Nations in Algeria where Cameroon crashed out from the group stage with defeats to The Gambia and Senegal.

===1990 World Cup===
Milla scored all his four goals in the tournament as a substitute as he started every game of the tournament on the bench. He started in the second half in four out of five World Cup matches and appeared in the first half once. His two crucial goals came in the second half of the match against Romania within just two minutes in extra time where he once again appeared as a substitute and following his heroics, he was hailed as a hero in Cameroon. It was the coach Valery Nepomnyashchy who decided to bring in Milla a bit earlier in the game against Romania knowing full well that a victory would secure Cameroon&#x27;s spot in the knockout stages and the coach later acknowledged the importance of Milla after his important late cameo in Cameroon&#x27;s remarkable upset victory over defending world champions Argentina. He was the oldest outfield player to feature in the 1990 FIFA World Cup and was the second oldest player during the tournament after England&#x27;s Peter Shilton.

The 38-year-old Milla emerged as one of the tournament&#x27;s major stars. He scored four goals in Italy, celebrating each one with a dance around the corner flag that has become a popular goal celebration ever since. Two of his goals came against Romania in Cameroon&#x27;s second game, and two more came in extra time against Colombia in the last 16 to carry Cameroon to the quarter-finals, the furthest an African team had ever advanced at the World Cup (Senegal and Ghana matched this feat in 2002 and 2010 respectively, whilst Morocco surpassed it by reaching the semi-finals in 2022). In the quarter-final match against England, Milla confirmed his super-sub legend by entering in the second half with Cameroon trailing 1–0 and drawing a penalty and then setting up a goal for Ekeke to give Cameroon a 2–1 lead, before England later scored two penalties, to win 3–2 after extra time. Due to his performances in Italy, he was once again named African Footballer of the Year.

His second goal celebration against Colombia became iconic across the world, and was used by Coca-Cola as seen in ads like the 2010 World Cup Coca-Cola advertisement.

===1994 World Cup===
Milla returned to the 1994 FIFA World Cup at the age of 42, being the oldest player ever to appear in a World Cup until the 2014 tournament when Colombia&#x27;s Faryd Mondragón entered in a group stage match versus Japan when 43 years and 3 days old. Mondragon&#x27;s record in turn was beaten by Essam El Hadary in 2018. Cameroon were knocked out in the group stages; however, Milla scored a goal against Russia, setting a record as the oldest goalscorer in a World Cup tournament, breaking the record he had set in 1990. His final international appearance came in a friendly against South Africa in December 1994.

==Post-playing career==
He is now an itinerant ambassador for African causes. He also works as a volunteer for various groups including the World Wide Fund for Nature. He also opened two companies for recycling plastic into paving slabs. In 2004, he was named to the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers selected by Pelé in conjunction with FIFA&#x27;s centenary celebrations.

He coached Montpellier from 2001 to 2007. He also went onto serve as the manager of the Tonnerre for a tenure of four years between 2007 and 2011.

== Legacy ==

He was appointed as honourary president of the Cameroonian Football Federation in March 2008. However, he was removed from the position as honorary president in May 2012 after criticising the top officials of the Cameroon Football Federation with regards to the lengthy ban imposed on Samuel Eto&#x27;o.

On 24 November 2022, he was honoured by the FIFA for his achievements as the FIFA President Gianni Infantino presented him a plaque just prior to the start of the group stage match between Cameroon and Switzerland during the 2022 FIFA World Cup at Al Janoub Stadium and Milla was also officially invited as a special guest by FIFA President to watch the match.

His wily celebration in a kind of Makossa dance at corner flag area during the 1990 FIFA World Cup changed the perceptions of how people started to see African football in a positive manner. His celebrations were deemed as instant hit and triggered positive energy to the viewers during the World Cup. He became the talk of the town and tournament sensation during the 1990 FIFA World Cup mainly for his skill sets on the field, dance celebrations and for his technique. He was later dubbed as &quot;King of the Corner Flag&quot;.

In 2020, he along with the Cameroonian teammates received three bedroom bungalows as gifts in recognition of their stellar run during the 1990 FIFA World Cup. However, they had to wait for 30 years to receive the gift despite early promise by President Paul Biya in 1990. The project was long delayed following the concerns with regards to corruption and malpractices relating to the submitted list of 44 beneficiaries.

<text>The Clarity Act (, known as Bill C-20 before it became law) is legislation passed by the Parliament of Canada that established the conditions under which the Government of Canada would enter into negotiations that might lead to secession following such a vote by one of the provinces. The Clarity Bill (C-20) was tabled for first reading in the House of Commons on 13 December 1999. It was passed by the House on 15 March 2000, and by the Senate, in its final version, on 29 June 2000.

Although the law applies to all provinces, the &quot;Clarity Act&quot; was created in response to the 1995 Quebec referendum and ongoing independence movement in that province. The content of the act was based on the 1998 secession reference to the Supreme Court of Canada made by the federal government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. Previously in 1996, a private member&#x27;s bill, the &quot;Quebec Contingency Act&quot; (Bill C-341) was introduced to establish the conditions which would apply to a referendum regarding the separation of Quebec from Canada, but it did not proceed further than the first reading.

Two days after the act had been introduced in the Canadian House of Commons, the Parti Québécois government passed &quot;An Act respecting the exercise of the fundamental rights and prerogatives of the Québec people and the Québec State&quot; in the National Assembly of Quebec.

==Background==

===Ambiguity of referendum question===
The motivation behind the act was largely based on the near separation vote of the 1995 Quebec referendum, in which the people of Quebec voted against the sovereignty option by a small margin (50.58% to 49.42%). Controversy surrounded the ambiguity and wording of the ballot question. In French, the question on the ballot asked:
In English, the question on the ballot asked:
Trilingual ballots were issued in communities in which Indigenous languages were commonly used.

===Stéphane Dion and the three letters===
Prime Minister Chrétien advised the governor general to appoint political scientist Stéphane Dion (first elected as Member of Parliament for the riding of Saint-Laurent–Cartierville in Montreal in 1996) as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs in 1996. Dion would challenge Quebec sovereigntist assertions about the legal validity of the 1995 Quebec referendum question in three open letters to Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard and Quebec Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Jacques Brassard.

In the first open letter, Dion challenged three assertions that Bouchard had made: that a unilateral declaration of independence is supported by international law, that a majority of &quot;50% plus one&quot; was a sufficient threshold for secession, and that international law would protect the territorial integrity of Quebec following a secession. Against the first assertion, Dion argued that the vast majority of international law experts &quot;believe that the right to declare secession unilaterally does not belong to constituent entities of a democratic country such as Canada.&quot; In regard to the simple majority argument, Dion argues that due to the momentous changes to Quebecers&#x27; lives that would result from secession, a simple majority that could disappear in the face of difficulties would be insufficient to ensure the political legitimacy of the sovereigntist project. In regard to the territorial integrity of Quebec, Dion retorts that &quot;there is neither a paragraph nor a line in international law that protects Quebec&#x27;s territory but not Canada&#x27;s. International experience demonstrates that the borders of the entity seeking independence can be called into question, sometimes for reasons based on democracy.&quot;

In Dion&#x27;s second open letter to Jacques Brassard, Quebec&#x27;s intergovernmental affairs minister, Dion expands upon his earlier arguments against the territorial integrity of Quebec following secession by highlighting the inconsistency in the argument that Canada is divisible but Quebec is not. Secondly, Dion underscores that without recognition by the Government of Canada and when opposed by a strong minority of citizens, a unilateral declaration of independence faces many difficulties in gaining international recognition.

In Dion&#x27;s third open letter to Lucien Bouchard, he criticizes the Quebec premier for accepting some aspects of the Supreme Court ruling on secession (such as the political obligation for the Government of Canada to negotiate secession following a clear expression of will from the people of Quebec) and not other sections of the ruling (such as the need for a clear majority on a clear question and the unconstitutionality of a unilateral declaration of independence). In regard to the ruling, Dion makes three claims: that the federal government has a role in the selection of the question and the level of support required for it to pass, that secession can only be achieved through negotiation rather than a &quot;unilateral declaration of independence&quot;, and that the terms of negotiation could not be decided solely by the Government of Quebec.

===Supreme Court Reference re Secession of Quebec===
On 30 September 1996, Dion submitted three questions to the Supreme Court of Canada constituting the Supreme Court Reference re Secession of Quebec:

#Under the Constitution of Canada, can the National Assembly, legislature, or government of Quebec effect the secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally?
#Does international law give the National Assembly, legislature, or government of Quebec the right to effect the secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally? In this regard, is there a right to self-determination under international law that would give the National Assembly, legislature, or government of Quebec the right to effect the secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally?
#In the event of a conflict between domestic and international law on the right of the National Assembly, legislature, or government of Quebec to effect the secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally, which would take precedence in Canada?

As soon as these questions were made public, both parties of the National Assembly, the Bloc Québécois, and numerous federalists denounced Ottawa&#x27;s gesture.

On 20 August 1998, the Supreme Court answered, concluding that Quebec cannot secede unilaterally under Canadian or international law. However, the Government of Canada would have to enter into negotiations with the Quebec government if Quebecers expressed a clear will to secede. It confirmed that the Parliament of Canada had the power to determine whether or not a referendum question was clear enough to trigger such negotiations. The Constitution of Canada would remain in effect until terms of secession were agreed to by all parties involved, through an amendment to the Constitution, which needs the consent of the federal Parliament and every province. These terms would have to respect principles of democracy; minority and individual rights as outlined in the Canadian constitution.

The court did not define what a clear majority means, and left that definition to politicians.

Any negotiations would need to consider &quot;many issues of great complexity and difficulty&quot;, such as economics, debt, minorities, Aboriginals, and boundaries. The court stated that:
Both the Government of Quebec and the Government of Canada publicly stated that they were very pleased with the opinion of the Supreme Court, which stated both that Quebec could not legally separate unilaterally from Canada, and that the Government of Canada would have a legal obligation to enter into separation negotiations with Quebec in the event that a clear majority of its populace were to vote in favour of independence.

===Bill Clinton and the First International Conference on Federalism===
Stéphane Dion organized and hosted the First International Conference on Federalism in Mont Tremblant in October 1999 to foster international support for the cause of federalism in Canada. Quebec sovereigntist leaders were granted a prominent role in the conference and used their floor time to denounce Canadian federalism before an international audience to the great annoyance of their federalist host. But the &quot;Clarity Act&quot; got a big boost during the closing speech by United States President Bill Clinton. While looking directly at Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard in the audience, Clinton appeared to echo the Supreme Court Reference, warning that &quot;when a people thinks it should be independent in order to have a meaningful political existence, serious questions should be asked... Are minority rights as well as majority rights respected? How are we going to co-operate with our neighbours?&quot; Clinton argued that federalism allows peoples seeking recognition of their identity a way to do so without isolating themselves in a nation-state. The speech laid to rest any doubts about the U.S. position on the desirability of unilateral secession in Quebec.

===Passage and reactions to &quot;Clarity Act&quot;===

The &quot;Clarity Act&quot; (Bill C-20) was later drafted and presented to the House of Commons on 13 December 1999. This was denounced by all provincial parties in the Quebec National Assembly, the Bloc Québécois, and many federalists. The Progressive Conservative Party, led by former Prime Minister Joe Clark, also opposed the act. The NDP voted in favour of the act.

Following its adoption by the Parliament of Canada, an open letter supporting Quebec&#x27;s right to self-determination was published and signed by numerous intellectuals from Quebec and other parts of Canada.

William Johnson, leader of Quebec&#x27;s largest Anglophone rights group, Alliance Quebec said the act would prevent the promulgation of misinformation by separatists.

Former Prime Minister Chrétien has often stated that the act was among his proudest achievements in federal politics.

In an interview with CTV News aired on 15 May 2005, separatist former premier of Quebec, Jacques Parizeau said that the act &quot;meant nothing&quot; and would be ignored.

On 7 December 2005, in the midst of a federal election, New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton too announced that he backed the act. This was in contrast to comments made in the 2004 election where he said that Canada should recognize a declaration of Quebec independence if sovereigntists win a referendum.

==Key points==
The key points of the legislation included the following:
* Giving the House of Commons the power to decide whether a proposed referendum question was considered clear before the public vote;
* Specifically stating that any question not solely referring to secession was to be considered unclear;
* Giving the House of Commons the power to determine whether a clear majority had expressed itself &quot;following&quot; any referendum vote, implying that some sort of supermajority is required for success;
* Stating that all provinces and the indigenous peoples were to be part of the negotiations;
* Allowing the House of Commons to override a referendum decision if it felt the referendum violated any of the tenets of the &quot;Clarity Act&quot;;
* The secession of a province of Canada would require an amendment to the Constitution of Canada.

==Quebec mirror law==
Following the adoption of the act by the federal government, the Parti Québécois provincial government adopted its own law, Bill 99 (&quot;An Act respecting the exercise of the fundamental rights and prerogatives of the Québec people and the Québec State&quot;,) This provincial act was inspired by the same decision of the Supreme Court of Canada that the &quot;Clarity Act&quot; was.

This Quebec act emphasizes the right to self-determination according to public international law. It also claims the right to territorial integrity of the province of Quebec. The act also recognizes the rights of Quebec&#x27;s English-speaking minority and of the aboriginal nations of Quebec. Finally, Article 13 clearly responds to the Canadian federal &quot;Clarity Act&quot; by stating: &quot;No other parliament or government may reduce the powers, authority, sovereignty or legitimacy of the National Assembly, or impose constraint on the democratic will of the Québec people to determine its own future.&quot;

<doc id="426865" wikidata="Q580343" url="?curid=426865" title="United Airlines Flight 232">
<text>United Airlines Flight 232 was a regularly scheduled United Airlines flight from Stapleton International Airport in Denver to O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago, continuing to Philadelphia International Airport. On July 19, 1989, the DC-10 (registered as N1819U) serving the flight crash-landed at Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux City, Iowa, after suffering a catastrophic failure of its tail-mounted engine due to an unnoticed manufacturing defect in the engine&#x27;s fan disk, which resulted in the loss of all flight controls. Of the 296 passengers and crew on board, 112 died during the accident, while 184 people survived. Thirteen of the passengers were uninjured. It was the deadliest single-aircraft accident in the history of United Airlines.

Despite the fatalities, the accident is considered a good example of successful crew resource management due to the pilot&#x27;s decision to allow a passenger check pilot to fly the aircraft and the discussion of the problem the crew was facing. A majority of those aboard survived; experienced test pilots in simulators were unable to reproduce a survivable landing. It has been termed &quot;The Impossible Landing&quot; as it is considered one of the most impressive landings ever performed in the history of aviation.

== Aircraft ==
The airplane, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 (registration ), was delivered in 1971 and owned by United Airlines since then. Before departure on the flight from Denver on July 19, 1989, the airplane had been operated for a total of 43,401 hours and 16,997 cycles (takeoff-landing pairs). The airplane was powered by three CF6-6D high bypass-ratio turbofan engines produced by General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE). The aircraft&#x27;s No. 2 (tail-mounted) engine had accumulated 42,436 hours and 16,899 cycles of operating time immediately prior to the accident flight.

The DC-10 used three independent hydraulic systems, each powered by one of the aircraft&#x27;s three engines, to power movement of the aircraft&#x27;s flight controls. In the event of loss of engine power or primary pump failure, a ram air turbine could provide emergency electrical power for electrically powered auxiliary pumps. These systems were designed to be redundant, such that if two hydraulic systems were inoperable, the one remaining hydraulic system would still permit the full operation and control of the airplane. However, at least one hydraulic system must have fluid present and the ability to hold fluid pressure to control the aircraft. Like other widebody transport aircraft of the time, the DC-10 was not designed to revert to unassisted manual control in the event of total hydraulic failure. The DC-10&#x27;s hydraulic system was designed and demonstrated to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as compliant with regulations that &quot;no single [engine] failure or malfunction or probable combination of failures will jeopardize the safe operation of the airplane...&quot;

== Crew ==

Flight 232&#x27;s captain, Alfred C. &quot;Al&quot; Haynes, 57, was hired by United Airlines in 1956. He was highly experienced and had 29,967 hours of total flight time with United, of which 7,190 were in the DC-10.

Haynes&#x27; co-pilot was First Officer William R. &quot;Bill&quot; Records, 48. He estimated that he had approximately 20,000 hours of total flight time. He was hired first by National Airlines in 1969. He worked subsequently for Pan American World Airways. He was hired by United in 1985, and had accrued 665 hours as a DC-10 first officer while at United.

Flight engineer Dudley J. Dvorak, 51, was hired by United Airlines in 1986. He estimated that he had about 15,000 hours of total flying time. While working for United, he had accumulated 1,903 hours as a flight engineer in the Boeing 727 and 33 hours as a flight engineer in the DC-10.

Dennis E. Fitch, nicknamed &quot;Denny&quot;, 46, was a training check pilot aboard Flight 232 as a passenger. He had studied the crash of Japan Air Lines Flight 123 which suffered a total hydraulic system failure and loss of flight controls and had practiced similar situations in a flight simulator. He was hired by United in 1968 and he estimated that, prior to working for United, he had accrued at least 1,400 hours of flight time with the Air National Guard, with a total flight time around 23,000 hours. His total DC-10 time with United was 2,987 hours, including 1,943 hours accrued as a flight engineer, 965 hours as a first officer, and 79 hours as a captain.

Eight flight attendants were also aboard the flight.

== Accident ==

=== Takeoff and engine failure ===
Flight 232 lifted off from Stapleton International Airport in Denver at 14:09 Central Daylight Time, en route to O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago with continuing service to Philadelphia.

At 15:16, while the airplane was making a slight right turn at its cruising altitude of , the fan disk of its tail-mounted General Electric CF6-6 engine disintegrated explosively. The uncontained failure resulted in the engine&#x27;s fan disk departing the aircraft, tearing out components including parts of the No. 2 hydraulic system and supply hoses in the process; these were later found near Alta, Iowa. Engine debris penetrated the aircraft&#x27;s tail section in numerous places, including the horizontal stabilizer, severing the No. 1 and No. 3 hydraulic system lines where they passed through the horizontal stabilizer.

The pilots felt a jolt, and the autopilot disengaged. As First Officer Records took hold of his control column, Captain Haynes concentrated on the tail engine, the instruments for which indicated it was malfunctioning; he found its throttle and fuel supply controls jammed. At Dvorak&#x27;s suggestion, a valve for fuel to the tail engine was shut off. This part of the emergency took 14 seconds.

=== Attempts to control the plane ===

Meanwhile, Records found that the airplane did not respond to his control column. Even with the control column turned all the way to the left, commanding maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flightthe aircraft was banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wing-mounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to level slowly.

While Haynes and Records performed the engine shutdown checklist for the failed engine, Dvorak observed that the gauges for fluid pressure and quantity in all three hydraulic systems were indicating zero. The loss of all hydraulic fluid meant that control surfaces were inoperative. The flight crew deployed the DC-10&#x27;s air-driven generator in an attempt to restore hydraulic power by powering the auxiliary hydraulic pumps, but this was unsuccessful. The crew contacted United Airlines maintenance personnel via radio, but were told that the possibility of a total loss of hydraulics in a DC-10 was considered so remote that no procedure had been established for such an event.

The airplane was tending to pull right and oscillated slowly vertically in a phugoid cyclecharacteristic of planes in which control surface command is lost. With each iteration of the cycle, the aircraft lost about of altitude. Fitch, an experienced United Airlines captain and DC-10 flight instructor, was among the passengers and volunteered to assist. The message was relayed by senior flight attendant Jan Brown Lohr to the flight crew, who invited Fitch into the cockpit; he began assisting at about 15:29.

Haynes asked Fitch to observe the ailerons through the passenger cabin windows to see if control inputs were having any effect. Fitch reported that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns for the remainder of the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.

Air traffic control (ATC) was contacted and an emergency landing at nearby Sioux Gateway Airport was organized. The conversation was recorded by the airplane&#x27;s cockpit voice recorder (CVR), including:

: Sioux City Approach: &quot;United Two Thirty-Two Heavy, the wind&#x27;s currently three six zero at one one; three sixty at eleven. You&#x27;re cleared to land on any runway.&quot;
: Haynes: &quot;[laughter] Roger. [laughter] You want to be particular and make it a runway, huh?&quot;

ATC asked the crew to make a left turn to keep them clear of the city:

: Haynes: &quot;Whatever you do, keep us away from the city.&quot;

Haynes later noted, &quot;We were too busy [to be scared]. You must maintain your composure in the airplane, or you will die. You learn that from your first day flying.&quot;

===Crash landing===

As the crew began to prepare for arrival at Sioux Gateway Airport, they questioned whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed so that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has the added benefit of unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, no change of the controllability of the aircraft resulted.

Landing was originally planned for Runway 31. Difficulties in controlling the aircraft made alignment with the runway almost impossible. While dumping some of the excess fuel, the airplane executed a series of mostly right-hand turns (turning the airplane in this direction was easier) with the intention of aligning with Runway 31. When they finished they were instead aligned with the closed Runway 22, and had little ability to maneuver. Runway 22 had been closed permanently a year earlier. Fire trucks had been placed on Runway 22, anticipating a landing on nearby Runway 31, so all the vehicles were quickly moved out of the way before the airplane touched down.

ATC also advised that a four-lane Interstate highway ran north and south just east of the airport, which they could land on if they did not think they could make the runway. Captain Haynes replied that they were passing over the interstate at that time and they would try for the runway instead.

Fitch continued to control the aircraft&#x27;s descent by adjusting engine thrust. With the loss of all hydraulics, the flaps could not be extended, and since flaps control both the minimum required forward speed and sink rate, the crew was unable to control either the airspeed or the sink rate. At final approach, the aircraft&#x27;s forward speed was and it had a sink rate of , while a safe landing would require forward speed and sink rate. Moments before landing, the roll to the right suddenly worsened significantly and the aircraft began to pitch forward into a dive; Fitch realized this and pushed both throttles to full power in a desperate, last-ditch attempt to level the plane. It was now 16:00. The CVR recorded these final moments:

: Records: &quot;Close &#x27;em off.&quot;
: Haynes: &quot;Left turn, close &#x27;em off.&quot;
: Records: &quot;Pull &#x27;em all off.&quot;
: Fitch: &quot;Nah, I can&#x27;t pull &#x27;em off or we&#x27;ll lose it, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s turning ya.&quot;
: Records: &quot;Okay.&quot;
: Fitch: &quot;Back, Al!&quot;
: Haynes: &quot;Left, left throttle, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left!&quot;
: Ground Proximity Warning System: &quot;Whoop whoop pull up. Whoop whoop pull up. Whoop whoop pull up.&quot;
: Haynes: &quot;Everybody stay in brace!&quot;
: GPWS: &quot;Whoop whoop pull up.&quot;
: Haynes: &quot;God!&quot;
: [Sound of impact]
: End of recording.

The engines were not able to respond to Fitch&#x27;s controls in time to stop the roll, and the airplane struck the ground with its right wing, spilling fuel which ignited immediately. The tail section broke off from the force of the impact, and the rest of the aircraft bounced several times, shedding the landing gear and engine nacelles and breaking the fuselage into several main pieces. At final impact, the right wing was torn off and the main part of the aircraft skidded sideways, rolled over onto its back, and slid to a stop upside-down in a corn field to the right of Runway 22. Witnesses reported that the aircraft &quot;cartwheeled&quot; end-over-end, but the investigation did not confirm this. The reports were due to misinterpretation of the video of the crash that showed the flaming right wing tumbling end-over-end and the intact left wing, still attached to the fuselage, rolling up and over as the fuselage flipped over.

== Injuries and deaths ==

Of the 296 people aboard, 112 died in the accident. Most were killed by injuries sustained during the multiple impacts, but 35 people in the middle fuselage section directly above the fuel tanks died from smoke inhalation in the post-crash fire. Of those, 24 had no traumatic blunt-force injuries. The majority of the 184 survivors were seated behind first class and ahead of the wings. Many passengers were able to walk out through the ruptures to the structure.

Of all of the passengers:
* 35 died because of smoke inhalation (none were in first class).
* 76 died for reasons other than smoke inhalation (17 in first class).
* One died a month after the crash.
* 47 were injured seriously (eight in first class).
* 125 had minor injuries (one in first class).
* 13 had no injuries (none in first class).

The passengers who died for reasons other than smoke inhalation were seated in rows 1–4, 24–25, and 28–38. Passengers who died because of smoke inhalation were seated in rows 14, 16, and 22–30. The person assigned to seat 20H moved to an unknown seat and died of smoke inhalation.

One crash survivor died one month after the accident; he was classified according to NTSB regulations as a survivor with serious injuries.

Fifty-two children, including four &quot;lap children&quot; without their own seats, were aboard the flight because of a United Airlines promotion for &quot;Children&#x27;s Day&quot;. Eleven children, including one lap child, died. Many of the children were traveling alone.

Rescuers did not identify the debris that was the remains of the cockpit, with the four crew members alive inside, until 35 minutes after the crash. All four recovered from their injuries and eventually returned to flight duty.

== Investigation ==

The rear engine&#x27;s fan disk and blade assemblyabout acrosscould not be located at the accident scene despite an extensive search. The engine&#x27;s manufacturer, General Electric, offered rewards of $50,000 for the disk and $1,000 for each fan blade. Three months after the crash, a farmer discovered most of the fan disk, with several blades still attached, in her cornfield, thereby qualifying her for a reward, as a General Electric lawyer confirmed. The rest of the fan disk and most of the additional blades were later found nearby.

The NTSB determined that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors, and limitations of the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines&#x27; engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage-1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained manner in which the engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems aboard the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10&#x27;s flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them.

Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust from the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and aligned it for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent because of the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result upon touchdown, the aircraft broke apart, rolled over, and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 184 (62.2%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.

===Failed component===

The investigation, while praising the actions of the flight crew for saving lives, later identified the cause of the accident as a failure by United Airlines maintenance processes and personnel to detect an existing fatigue crack. The Probable Cause in the report by the NTSB read as follows: 

Post-crash analysis of the crack surfaces showed the presence of a penetrating fluorescent dye used to detect cracks during maintenance. The presence of the dye indicated that the crack was present and should have been detected at a prior inspection. The detection failure arose from poor attention to human factors in United Airlines&#x27; specification of maintenance processes.

Investigators discovered an impurity and fatigue crack in the disk. Titanium reacts with air when melted, which creates impurities that can initiate fatigue cracks like that found in the crash disk. To prevent this, the ingot that would become the fan disk was formed using a &quot;double vacuum&quot; process: the raw materials were melted together in a vacuum, allowed to cool and solidify, then melted in a vacuum once more. After the double vacuum process, the ingot was shaped into a billet, a sausage-like form about 16 inches in diameter, and tested using ultrasound to look for defects. Defects were located and the ingot was processed further to remove them, but some nitrogen contamination remained. GE later added a third vacuum-forming stage because of their investigation into failing rotating titanium engine parts.

The contamination caused what is known as a hard alpha inclusion, where a contaminant particle in a metal alloy causes the metal around it to become brittle. The brittle titanium around the impurity then cracked during forging and fell out during final machining, leaving a cavity with microscopic cracks at the edges. For the next 18 years, the crack grew slightly each time the engine was powered up and brought to operating temperature. Eventually, the crack broke open, causing the disk to fail.

The origins of the crash disk are uncertain because of significant irregularities and gaps, noted in the NTSB report, in the manufacturing records of GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE) and its suppliers. Records found after the accident indicated that two rough-machined forgings having the serial number of the crash disk had been routed through GEAE manufacturing. Records indicated that Alcoa supplied GE with TIMET titanium forgings for one disk with the serial number of the crash disk. Some records show that this disk &quot;was rejected for an unsatisfactory ultrasonic indication&quot;, that an outside laboratory performed an ultrasound inspection of this disk, that this disk was subsequently returned to GE, and that this disk should have been scrapped. The FAA report stated, &quot;There is no record of warranty claim by GEAE for defective material and no record of any credit for GEAE processed by Alcoa or TIMET&quot;. 
GE records of the second disk having the serial number of the crash disk indicate that it was made with an RMI Titanium Company titanium billet supplied by Alcoa. Research of GE&#x27;s records showed no other titanium parts were manufactured at GE from this RMI titanium billet during the period of 1969 to 1990. GE records indicate that final finishing and inspection of the crash disk were completed on December 11, 1971. Alcoa records indicate that this RMI titanium billet was first cut in 1972 and that all forgings made from this material were for airframe parts. If the Alcoa records were accurate, the RMI titanium could not have been used to manufacture the crash disk, indicating that the initially rejected TIMET disk with &quot;an unsatisfactory ultrasonic indication&quot; was the crash disk. 
CF6 engines like the one containing the crash disk were used to power many civilian and military aircraft at the time of the crash. Due to concerns that the accident could recur, a large number of in-service disks were examined by ultrasound for indications of defects. The fan disks on at least two other engines were found to have defects like that of the crash disk. Prioritization and efficiency of inspections of the many engines suspected would have been aided by determination of the titanium source of the crash disk. Chemical analyses of the crash disk intended to determine its source were inconclusive. The NTSB report stated that if examined disks were not from the same source, &quot;the records on a large number of GEAE disks are suspect. It also means that any AD (Airworthiness Directive) action that is based on the serial number of a disk could fail to have its intended effect because suspect disks could remain in service.&quot;

== Influence on the industry ==
The NTSB investigation, after reconstructions of the accident in flight simulators, deemed that training for such an event involved too many factors to be practical. While some degree of control was possible, no precision could be achieved, and a landing with these conditions was stated to be &quot;a highly random event&quot;. Expert United and McDonnell Douglas pilots were unable to reproduce a survivable landing; according to a United pilot who flew with Fitch, &quot;Most of the simulations never even made it close to the ground&quot;. The NTSB stated that &quot;under the circumstances the UAL (United Airlines) flight crew performance was highly commendable and greatly exceeded reasonable expectations.&quot; At the time of the crash, McDonnell Douglas had ended production of DC-10&#x27;s, with the last of these being delivered to Nigeria Airways during the summer of 1989. The last passenger version of the DC-10 flew in 2014, although freighter versions continued to operate until late 2022.

Because this type of aircraft control (with loss of control surfaces) is difficult for humans to achieve, some researchers have attempted to integrate this control ability into the computers of fly-by-wire aircraft. Early attempts to add the ability to real airplanes were not very successful; the software was based on experiments performed in flight simulators where jet engines are usually modeled as &quot;perfect&quot; devices with exactly the same thrust on each engine, a linear relationship between throttle setting and thrust, and instantaneous response to input. Later, computer models were updated to account for these nonlinear factors, and aircraft such as the F-15 STOL/MTD have been flown successfully with this software installed.

===Titanium processing===
The manufacturing process for titanium was changed to eliminate the type of gaseous anomaly that served as the starting point for the crack. Newer batches of titanium use much higher melting temperatures and a &quot;triple vacuum&quot; process in an attempt to eliminate such impurities (triple melt VAR).

===Aircraft designs===
Newer designs such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 have incorporated hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. After the United 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number three hydraulic system in the area below the number two engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would still be able to control the aircraft&#x27;s pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft&#x27;s ailerons and spoilers. Although not ideal, the system provides a greater control than that available to the United 232.

Losing all three hydraulic systems remained possible if serious damage occurs elsewhere, as nearly happened to a cargo DC-10-40F in April 2002 during takeoff in San Salvador when a main-gear tire exploded after running over a lost thrust reverser cascade. The extensive damage in the left wing caused total loss of pressure from the number-one and the number-two hydraulic systems. The number-three system was dented but not penetrated. NTSB then recommended that FAA &quot;Require adequate protection of DC-10 hydraulic system components in the wing area from tire fragments&quot; by better shielding or adding fuses in this area.

===Restraints for children===
Of the four children deemed too young to require seats of their own (&quot;lap children&quot;), one died from smoke inhalation. The NTSB added a safety recommendation to the FAA on its &quot;List of Most Wanted Safety Improvements&quot; in May 1999 suggesting a requirement for children younger than two years old to be restrained safely, which was removed in November 2006. The accident began a campaign directed by United Flight 232&#x27;s senior flight attendant, Jan Brown Lohr, for all children to have seats on aircraft.

The argument against requiring seats on aircraft for children younger than age two is the higher cost to a family of having to buy a seat for the child, and this higher cost will motivate more families to drive instead of fly, and incur the much greater risk of driving (see Epidemiology of motor vehicle collisions). The FAA estimates that a regulation that all children must have a seat would equate, for every one child&#x27;s life saved on an aircraft, to 60 people dying in highway accidents.

Though it is no longer on the &quot;most wanted&quot; list, providing aircraft restraints for children younger than age two is still recommended practice by the NTSB and FAA, though it is not required by the FAA as of May 2016. The NTSB asked the International Civil Aviation Organization to make this a requirement in September 2013.

===Crew resource management===

The accident has since become an example of successful crew resource management (CRM). For much of aviation&#x27;s history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were expected to respect the captain&#x27;s expertise without question. This began to change during the 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster in 1977 and the crash of United Airlines Flight 173 outside Portland, Oregon in 1978. CRM, while still considering the captain as final authority, instructs crew members to speak up when they detect a problem, and instructs captains to listen to crew concerns. United Airlines instituted a CRM class during the early 1980s. The NTSB later credited this training as valuable for the success of United 232&#x27;s crew in handling their emergency. The FAA made CRM mandatory after the accident.

== Factors contributing to survival rate ==
Of the 296 people aboard, 112 were killed and 184 survived. Haynes later identified three factors relating to the time of day that increased the survival rate:

# The accident occurred during daylight hours in good weather;
# The accident occurred as a shift change was occurring at both a regional trauma center and a regional burn center in Sioux City, allowing for more medical personnel to treat the injured;
# The accident occurred when the Iowa Air National Guard was on duty at Sioux Gateway Airport, allowing for 285 trained personnel to assist with triage and evacuation of the injured.

&quot;Had any of those things not been there,&quot; Haynes said, &quot;I&#x27;m sure the fatality rate would have been a lot higher.&quot;

Haynes also credited CRM as being one of the factors that saved his own life, and many others.
When Haynes died in August 2019, United Airlines issued a statement thanking him for &quot;his exceptional efforts aboard Flight UA232&quot;.

As with the Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 crash of a similarly sized Lockheed L-1011 in 1972, the relatively shallow angle of descent likely played a large part in the relatively high survival rate. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that under the circumstances, &quot;a safe landing was virtually impossible&quot;.

== Similar accidents ==
The odds against all three hydraulic systems failing simultaneously had previously been calculated as low as a billion to one. Yet such calculations assume that multiple failures must have independent causes, an unrealistic assumption, and similar flight control failures have indeed occurred:

* In 1971, a Boeing 747, operating as Pan Am 845, struck approach light structures for the reciprocal runway as it lifted off the runway at San Francisco Airport. Major damage to the belly and landing gear resulted, which caused the loss of hydraulic fluid from three of its four flight control systems. The fluid which remained in the fourth system gave the captain very limited control of some of the spoilers, ailerons, and one inboard elevator. That was sufficient to circle the plane while fuel was dumped and then to make a hard landing. There were no fatalities, but there were some injuries.
* In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, operating as Eastern Air Lines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine. The shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage on all four of its hydraulic systems, which were also close together in the tail structure. Fluid was lost in three of the four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was struck by shrapnel, but not punctured. The hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.
* In 1985, Japan Air Lines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, suffered a rupture of the pressure bulkhead in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the rear bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of the bulkhead and blew off the plane&#x27;s vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were able to keep the plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.
* In 1994, RA85656, a Tupolev Tu-154 operating as Baikal Airlines Flight 130, crashed near Irkutsk shortly after departing from Irkutsk Airport, Russia. Damage to the starter caused a fire in engine number two (located in the rear fuselage). High temperatures during the fire destroyed the tanks and pipes of all three hydraulic systems. The crew lost control of the aircraft. The out-of-control plane, at a speed of 275 knots, hit the ground at a dairy farm and burned. All 124 passengers and crew, as well as a dairyman on the ground, died.
* In 2003, OO-DLL, a DHL Airbus A300, was struck by a surface-to-air missile shortly after departing from Baghdad International Airport, Iraq. The missile struck the port-side wing, rupturing a fuel tank and causing the loss of all three hydraulic systems. With the flight controls disabled, the crew used differential thrust to execute a safe landing at Baghdad.
* In 2024, an Embraer 190, operating as Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243, was hit by a Russian anti-air system, rupturing all three hydraulic lines, rendering the plane inoperable. After diverting from the original destination of Grozny, Russia, the pilots decided to cross the Caspian Sea to attempt a landing in Kazakhstan. The pilots flew for more than 70 minutes with no control surfaces before crashing on a third attempt to land at Aktau International Airport. Of the 67 people onboard, 38 died, including all five of the crew.

The disintegration of a turbine disc, leading to loss of control, was a direct cause of two major aircraft disasters in Poland:

* On March 14, 1980, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007, an Ilyushin Il-62, attempted a go-around when the crew experienced troubles with a gear indicator. When thrust was applied, the low-pressure turbine disc in engine number 2 disintegrated because of material fatigue; parts of the disc damaged engines number 1 and 3 and severed control pushers for both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. After 26 seconds of uncontrolled descent, the aircraft crashed, killing all 87 people on board.
* On May 9, 1987, improperly assembled bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated and exploded during cruise over the village of Lipinki, causing the shaft to break in two; this caused the low-pressure turbine disc to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control pushers. The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but trim tabs to control the crippled aircraft, but on the final approach, the trim controlling links burned and the crew completely lost control over the aircraft. Soon after, it crashed on the outskirts of Warsaw; all 183 on board died. Had the plane stayed airborne for 40 seconds more, it would have been able to reach the runway.

In contrast to deploying landing gear:

* On August 15, 2019, Ural Airlines Flight 178, an Airbus A321, encountered a flock of seagulls resulting in a bird strike that caused fires in both CFM56-5 engines just after takeoff from Zhukovsky International Airport, Moscow, Russia. Due to a failure to follow standard operating procedures, the plane was forced to land in a corn field with the landing gear raised. The pilots claimed they intentionally landed with the landing gear up, though the CVR recording revealed no discussion about this. Everyone on board the flight survived. 74 people were injured, none severely.

<text>Inner Asia refers to the northern and landlocked regions spanning North, Central and East Asia. It includes parts of western and northeast China, as well as southern Siberia. The area overlaps with some definitions of &quot;Central Asia&quot;, mostly the historical ones, but certain regions that are often included in Inner Asia, such as Manchuria, are not a part of Central Asia by any of its definitions. Inner Asia may be regarded as the western and northern &quot;frontier&quot; of China proper and as being bounded by East Asia proper, which consists of China proper, Japan and Korea.

The extent of Inner Asia has been understood differently in different periods. &quot;Inner Asia&quot; is sometimes contrasted to &quot;China proper&quot;, that is, the territories originally unified under the Qin dynasty with majority Han populations. In 1800, Chinese Inner Asia consisted of four main areas, namely Manchuria (modern Northeast China and Outer Manchuria), the Mongolian Plateau (Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia), Xinjiang (Chinese Turkestan or East Turkestan), and Tibet. Many of these areas had been only recently conquered by the Qing dynasty of China and, during most of the Qing period, they were governed through administrative structures different from those of the older Chinese provinces. A Qing government agency, the Lifan Yuan, supervised the empire&#x27;s Inner Asian regions, also known as Chinese Tartary. The frontier regions of China proper—Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan—are also sometimes included as part of Inner Asia.

==Definition and usage==
&quot;Inner Asia&quot; today has a range of definitions and usages. Denis Sinor, for example, used &quot;Inner Asia&quot; in contrast to agricultural civilizations, noting its changing borders, such as when a Roman province was taken by the Huns, areas of North China were occupied by the Mongols, or Anatolia came under Turkish influence, eradicating Hellenistic culture.

Scholars or historians of the Qing dynasty, such as those who compiled the New Qing History, often use the term &quot;Inner Asia&quot; when studying Qing interests or reigns outside China proper, although previous Chinese dynasties like the Han dynasty, Tang dynasty and Ming dynasty also expanded their realms and influences into Inner Asia.

According to Morris Rossabi, Inner Asia is composed not only of the five Central Asian countries, which includes Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan, but also includes Afghanistan, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Manchuria, and parts of Iran.

The Committee on Inner Asian and Altaic Studies of Harvard University defines Inner Asia as a region consisting of West Turkestan, East Turkestan (i.e., Xinjiang), Eastern Iran, Northern Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu and northwestern Yunnan.

The Mongolia and Inner Asia Studies Unit at the University of Cambridge defines Inner Asia as &quot;an area centred on Mongolia and extending across the region of the great steppes to the Himalayas&quot;, including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Altai, Tuva, Buryatia and Chita.

==In other languages==
In French, can mean either &quot;Central Asia&quot; or &quot;Inner Asia&quot;, while Mongolia and Tibet are grouped as ().

The terms meaning &quot;Inner Asia&quot; in the languages of Inner Asia itself are all modern translations of terms in European languages, mostly Russian.

==Related terms==

===Central Asia===

&quot;Central Asia&quot; normally denotes the western part of Inner Asia; that is, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, with Afghanistan sometimes also included as part of Central Asia. However, The Library of Congress subject classification system treats &quot;Central Asia&quot; and Inner Asia as synonymous.

===Central Eurasia===
According to Morris Rossabi, the term &quot;Inner Asia&quot; is the well-established term for the area in the literature. However, because of its deficiencies, including the implication of an &quot;Outer Asia&quot; that does not exist, Denis Sinor has proposed the neologism &quot;Central Eurasia&quot;, which emphasizes the role of the area in intercontinental exchange. According to Sinor:
The definition that can be given of Central Eurasia in space is negative. It is that part of the continent of Eurasia that lies beyond the borders of the great sedentary civilizations... Although the area of Central Eurasia is subject to fluctuations, the general trend is that of diminution. With the territorial growth of the sedentary civilizations, their borderline extends and offers a larger surface on which new layers of barbarians will be deposited.
== Origin of Inner Asian studies ==

Central Europe is the birthplace of Inner Asian studies in the West. Hungarian explorers and scholars of the early 19th century travelled to Inner Asia with an attempt to find their own national origins. Sándor Kőrösi Csoma was the first among these explorers, who became the founder of Tibetology. The Hungarian count Béla Széchenyi led a scientific expedition to Inner Asia in 1877–1880 and subsequently founded the journal &quot;Turán&quot; in 1913. The term &quot;Inner Asian studies&quot; (; ) first appeared in the masthead of &quot;Turán&quot;.

Aurel Stein&#x27;s discoveries of Inner Asian antiquities contributed significantly to the knowledge of the civilizations of this region. In 1928, he published his 4-volume work entitled &quot;Innermost Asia: Detailed Report of Explorations in Central Asia, Kan-su and Eastern Iran, Carried Out and Described under the Orders of H.M. Indian Government&quot;. In 1940, the first academic chair for Inner Asian studies was established by Lajos Ligeti at the University of Budapest.

<doc id="426882" wikidata="Q2353607" url="?curid=426882" title="Declaration of Indulgence (1687)">
<text>The Declaration of Indulgence, also called Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, was a pair of proclamations made by James II of England and Ireland and VII of Scotland in 1687. The Indulgence was first issued for Scotland on 12 February and then for England on 4 April 1687. An early step towards establishing freedom of religion in Great Britain and Ireland, it was cut short by the Glorious Revolution.
The Declaration granted broad religious freedom in England by suspending penal laws enforcing conformity to the Church of England and allowing people to worship in their homes or chapels as they saw fit, and it ended the requirement of affirming religious oaths before gaining employment in government office.

By use of the royal suspending power, the king lifted the religious penal laws and granted toleration to the various Christian denominations, Catholic and Protestant, within his kingdoms. The Declaration of Indulgence was supported by William Penn, who was widely perceived to be its instigator. The declaration was greatly opposed by Anglicans in England on both religious and constitutional grounds. Some Anglicans objected to the fact that the Declaration had no specified limits and thus, at least in theory, licensed the practice of any religion, including Islam, Judaism, or paganism.

==1687==
In Scotland, Presbyterians initially refused to accept the Declaration of Indulgence. The King re-issued it on 28 June, giving the Presbyterians the same liberties as Catholics; this was accepted by most of the Presbyterians, with the notable exception of the Covenanters. The Declaration of Indulgence, as well as granting religious liberties to his subjects, also reaffirmed the King&#x27;s &quot;Soveraign Authority, Prerogative Royal and absolute power, which all our Subjects are to obey without Reserve&quot;, and thus espoused an absolute monarchy.

The English version was welcomed by most non-conformists, but, as in Scotland, the Presbyterians were more reluctant to wholeheartedly accept it. There was concern that the toleration rested only on the King&#x27;s arbitrary will.

==1688==
The English Declaration of Indulgence was reissued on 27 April 1688, leading to open resistance from Anglicans. Few clergy read out the Declaration in Church.

William Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury, and six other Bishops presented a petition to the King declaring the Declaration of Indulgence illegal. James promptly had the seven bishops tried for rebellion and sedition; however, the bishops were acquitted. Many Presbyterians were sceptical of the king&#x27;s intentions, while other dissenters, including the Quakers and the Baptists, gave thanks to the king for the Declaration of Indulgence.

The declarations were voided when James II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution. The Bill of Rights abolished the suspending power.

<text>Hugh of Lucca or Hugh Borgognoni (also &quot;Ugo&quot;) (1160–c.1259) was a medieval surgeon. He and Theodoric of Lucca, his son or student, are noted for their use of wine as an antiseptic in the early 13th century.

==Hugh of Lucca==
Hugh of Lucca, also known Ugo de Borgognoni, was born in 1160, around the time the teaching of &quot;corpus juris&quot; was said to be common where the University of Bologna had included the &quot;healing art&quot; of medicine into its subjects of grammar, dialectic, rhetoric, and the free subjects of music and astronomy. He was a physician at the end of the period where medicine was a profession transmitted from father to son via observations.

It is assumed that he arrived in Bologna and continued his profession as a surgeon until his death there. Some regard him as the founder of the surgical school of Bologna as he was the pioneer of a new wound treatment and the starter of a new era. Although it is also declared in some sources that in the early 13th century the Salernitan surgical traditions of the Medical School of Salerno had been brought to Bologna by Roland of Parma, at the time Hugh of Lucca was employed by the city as military surgeon.

He is also said to have been a man of action, since he accompanied the Bolognese army on the Fifth Crusade, visiting both Syria and Egypt, and being present at the Siege of Dammietta in 1219. He is thought to have gained rich experience with not only the wounds of the soldiers but also with the Black Death, which was ravaging the opposing armies during the lengthy conflict he witnessed.

===Acts in the Crusades===
Hugh of Lucca was initially an empiricist, challenging the doctrine of Galen by methods rooted in experiments and experiences. He advocated for aseptic theory as opposed to conventional treatments, where suppuration – pus formation – was thought necessary for healing. He condemned the laudable pus theory, which he regarded as &quot;hindering the nature and prolonging the healing&quot;.

An October 1214 contract with the city of Bologna as a municipal surgeon stipulated that he would reside in that city for six months of the year and during periods of civil war. Residents, including inhabitants of the nearby countryside, would be treated free of charge. The contract also required that Hugh provide medical services to the army in the field. In return, he was paid 600 Bolognese lire per year and received some property. This has been called &quot;the earliest undisputed example in medieval Italy where a doctor was hired long term by a city to treat its population&quot;.

Although he was over sixty, Hugh accompanied Bolognese soldiers on the Fifth Crusade to Egypt between 1218 and 1221. Hugh&#x27;s wartime experience of treating injured Bolognese soldiers in the field convinced him that the most effective method of healing wounds of the skull was without the encouragement of suppuration. He recommended removing foreign objects from flesh wounds and cleansing the wound with wine-soaked cushions, then drying the wound immediately. Theodoric, who recorded his father and master&#x27;s techniques, described the procedure of treating wounds as &quot;not only desirable but attainable&quot;, and offered an explanation of the process: &quot;Therefore in the case of a simple skin wound, if the lesion should not entail loss of tissue, or should be a lesion of the skull, you will treat it thus: in the first place, the lips of the wound, and all about the wound should be debrided; and then the wound should be completely cleansed of fuzz, hair, and anything else, and let the wound be wiped quite dry with fine lint soaked in warm wine and wrung out. Thus, the lips of the wound may be reunited as well as possible in accordance with their original healthy state and having made compresses from fine clean lint soaked in warm wine and placed upon the wound so as to fit, it be bound up with a light bandage in such a way that the reapproximation of the wound edges cannot be disturbed at all.&quot;

In 1221, after his return to Bologna, he was appointed as a legal physician in the city, a position recorded for the first time and concerned with medical jurisprudence. Although he lived into his 90s, and assumedly passed away in 1259, it is continuously stated in sources that he left no written record, and all his achievements were noted down by Theodoric.

=== Innovations in wound treatment ===
For those wounded on the medieval battlefield, the odds of survival were not high. Despite being treated, many would die shortly afterwards from infections. In the 13th and 14th centuries, a small group of surgeons believed they had a better way of treating these injuries. But they would have to challenge hundreds of years of medical knowledge.

Hugh of Lucca, his pupil and son Theodoric, Bishop of Cervia (1205–96), and French anatomist and surgeon Henri of Mondeville (1260–1320), who learned this method from studying Theodoric&#x27;s Surgery in medical courses taught by Jean Pitard (1235–1330) and Lanfranc of Milan (1250–1306) challenged the conventional treatment of wounds sustained in battle, which involved suppuration, or the encouragement of pus formation, held to be necessary in the healing process. They advocated and practiced a treatment known as the aseptic theory or dry method of wound treatment in which foreign objects were removed, haemorrhaging was stopped, and wounds were closed immediately. Upon closure, wounds were dressed in a dry cloth without encouraging pus formation or suppuration. The dry method of healing was controversial for two reasons. Firstly, it rejected conventional medical wisdom based on Galen and other ancient writers who believed that the healing was not possible without the removal of &quot;bad humours&quot;. Several experts have argued that the doctrine of the humours was so entrenched in the medieval medical community that to challenge it was an act of heresy. Any medic who opposed the thousand-year method of healing was maligned. Secondly, the dry method of healing repudiated a religious belief system that taught that the evacuation of bad humours was a cleansing of evil from the body. Suppuration was a form of exorcism. Medieval people often viewed disease and infection as punishment for bad behaviour. The individual needed to be cleansed both physically and spiritually.

== Usage of wine ==
Wine, throughout the history of medicine, was a commonly used ingredient. It was mainly used as an anaesthetic or as an agent to ease and diminish the pain of injured patients. Wine was initially given orally during surgical procedures to induce forgetfulness and be less likely to be traumatized by the procedure. The vast usage of wine by others during operations through history of medicine suggests it was used mostly mixed together with various herbs or numerous oils.

Hugh of Lucca used wine, directly on wounds, primarily for its antiseptic properties. There is no record stating the exact date he discovered his technique. His method of treating fresh wounds, followed by soaking lint in boiled wine, was used to clean the wound of any foreign materials as well as to disinfect the area. After this operation was successfully accomplished, he would cover the cleaned wound with a compress that had also been soaked in boiled wine. He tried to prevent the wine from potentially being contaminated through air.

Hugh of Lucca relied mostly on practical knowledge by trial and error, as the philosophy he followed, empiricism, regarded experience as the sole source of knowledge. He found oils to be too slippery and hard to use during clinical operations to bond the two edges of the wound in surgeries. He preferred using wine instead, as it vaporized after a period of time, unlike oils in general, and dried along with the wound while disinfecting it.

<text>Donald Frank Mazankowski (July 27, 1935 – October 27, 2020) was a Canadian politician who served as a cabinet minister under prime ministers Joe Clark and Brian Mulroney, including as deputy prime minister under Mulroney.

After retiring from politics in 1993, Mazankowski was a consultant with the law firm of Gowling Lafleur Henderson LLP. He also served as a director or trustee for several companies, including Weyerhaeuser Co., ATCO Ltd., Shaw Communications Inc., and Power Corporation of Canada.

==Early life==
Mazankowski was born in Viking, Alberta, on July 27, 1935. His parents, Frank and Dora (Lonowski), were of Polish descent and came to Canada from the United States in 1921. After he completed high school, Mazankowski moved to Chicago, where he worked as a dispatcher in a trucking business. He later returned to Alberta and started his own gas station in Innisfree. Together with his brother Ray, he opened a car dealership on the outskirts of Vegreville.

==Political career==
Mazankowski&#x27;s first taste of politics came during his five-year tenure as a trustee of a local separate school. This inspired him to seek the Progressive Conservative Party nomination in his local riding of Vegreville, which he won in 1968. During the federal election that year, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Vegreville.

During the short-lived Clark government, Mazankowski served as Minister of Transport. When the Tories returned to power under Mulroney in the 1984 election, Mazankowski again became Minister of Transport. In 1986, he was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister and Government House Leader. Mazankowski became one of the most widely known public faces of the Tory government. He played an especially important role as an advocate for the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement.

A bill to restore the death penalty was defeated by the House of Commons on June 30, 1987, in a 148–127 vote. (The then Liberal government led by Pierre Trudeau had abolished the death penalty in Canada in 1976.) While Prime Minister Mulroney, Minister of Justice Ray Hnatyshyn, and Minister of External Affairs Clark opposed the bill, Mazankowski and most PC MPs supported it. He became Finance Minister during a cabinet reshuffle in April 1991, replacing Michael Wilson.

==After politics==
Mazankowski retired from politics on June 7, 1993. When Kim Campbell succeeded Mulroney as PC leader and prime minister two weeks later, Mazankowski was replaced as Finance Minister by Gilles Loiselle. Mazankowski did not run in the 1993 election that saw his party reduced to two seats in the House of Commons. He returned to the private sector and served on the boards of several organizations, including the University of Alberta. Mazankowski declined an offer of a Senate seat made by Mulroney in his final days as prime minister.

In August 2001, Ralph Klein, the Premier of Alberta at the time, established the Premier&#x27;s Advisory Council on Health, with Mazankowski as chair. He put the Council of twelve men in charge of reviewing Alberta&#x27;s health care system and offering recommendations for health reform. The Council released its report on January 8, 2002, and the Alberta government accepted all of the recommendations. The report focused on market-consumerism with emphasis on consumer choice and market competition.

Mazankowski played an important role in the merger of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance in 2003, and he was a strong supporter of the new Conservative Party of Canada. Mazankowski died on October 27, 2020, at the age of 85.

==Honours==
In 1992, Mazankowski was one of a few prominent Canadians who were given the honorific style of &quot;Right Honourable&quot; without having held any of the offices that would entitle them to it automatically.

In 2000, Mazankowski was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and he was promoted to Companion in 2013. He was inducted to the Alberta Order of Excellence in 2003.

==Archives==
There is a Donald Mazankowski fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

<doc id="426889" wikidata="Q625648" url="?curid=426889" title="Photometry (optics)">
<text>Photometry is a branch of optics that deals with measuring light in terms of its perceived brightness to the human eye. It is concerned with quantifying the amount of light that is emitted, transmitted, or received by an object or a system.

In modern photometry, the radiant power at each wavelength is weighted by a luminosity function that models human brightness sensitivity. Typically, this weighting function is the photopic sensitivity function, although the scotopic function or other functions may also be applied in the same way. The weightings are standardized by the CIE and ISO.

Photometry is distinct from radiometry, which is the science of measurement of radiant energy (including light) in terms of absolute power.

==Photometry and the eye==
The human eye is not equally sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light. Photometry attempts to account for this by weighting the measured power at each wavelength with a factor that represents how sensitive the eye is at that wavelength. The standardized model of the eye&#x27;s response to light as a function of wavelength is given by the luminosity function. The eye has different responses as a function of wavelength when it is adapted to light conditions (photopic vision) and dark conditions (scotopic vision). Photometry is typically based on the eye&#x27;s photopic response, and so photometric measurements may not accurately indicate the perceived brightness of sources in dim lighting conditions where colors are not discernible, such as under just moonlight or starlight. Photopic vision is characteristic of the eye&#x27;s response at luminance levels over three candela per square metre. Scotopic vision occurs below 2 × 10−5 cd/m2. Mesopic vision occurs between these limits and is not well characterised for spectral response.

==Photometric quantities==

Measurement of the effects of electromagnetic radiation became a field of study as early as the end of the 18th century. Measurement techniques varied depending on the effects under study and gave rise to different nomenclature. The total heating effect of infrared radiation as measured by thermometers led to the development of radiometric units in terms of total energy and power. The use of the human eye as a detector led to photometric units, weighted by the eye&#x27;s response characteristic. Study of the chemical effects of ultraviolet radiation led to characterization by the total dose or actinometric units expressed in photons per second.

Many different units of measure are used for photometric measurements. The adjective &quot;bright&quot; can refer to a light source which delivers a high luminous flux (measured in lumens), or to a light source which concentrates the luminous flux it has into a very narrow beam (candelas), or to a light source that is seen against a dark background. Because of how light propagates through three-dimensional space — spreading out, becoming concentrated, reflecting off shiny or matte surfaces — and because light consists of many different wavelengths, the number of fundamentally different kinds of light measurements that can be made is large, and so are the numbers of quantities and units that represent them.

For example, offices are typically &quot;brightly&quot; illuminated by an array of many recessed fluorescent lights for a combined high luminous flux. A laser pointer has very low luminous flux (it could not illuminate a room) but is blindingly bright in one direction (high luminous intensity in that direction).

===Photometric versus radiometric quantities===
There are two parallel systems of quantities known as photometric and radiometric quantities. Every quantity in one system has an analogous quantity in the other system. Some examples of parallel quantities include:

*Luminance (photometric) and radiance (radiometric)
*Luminous flux (photometric) and radiant flux (radiometric)
*Luminous intensity (photometric) and radiant intensity (radiometric)

In photometric quantities every wavelength is weighted according to how sensitive the human eye is to it, while radiometric quantities use unweighted absolute power. For example, the eye responds much more strongly to green light than to red, so a green source will have greater luminous flux than a red source with the same radiant flux would. Radiant energy outside the visible spectrum does not contribute to photometric quantities at all, so for example a 1000 watt space heater may put out a great deal of radiant flux (1000 watts, in fact), but as a light source it puts out very few lumens (because most of the energy is in the infrared, leaving only a dim red glow in the visible).
===Watts versus lumens===
Watts are units of radiant flux while lumens are units of luminous flux. A comparison of the watt and the lumen illustrates the distinction between radiometric and photometric units.

The watt is a unit of power. We are accustomed to thinking of light bulbs in terms of power in watts. This power is not a measure of the amount of light output, but rather indicates how much energy the bulb will use. Because incandescent bulbs sold for &quot;general service&quot; all have fairly similar characteristics (same spectral power distribution), power consumption provides a rough guide to the light output of incandescent bulbs.

Watts can also be a direct measure of output. In a radiometric sense, an incandescent light bulb is about 80% efficient: 20% of the energy is lost (e.g. by conduction through the lamp base). The remainder is emitted as radiation, mostly in the infrared. Thus, a 60 watt light bulb emits a total radiant flux of about 45 watts. Incandescent bulbs are, in fact, sometimes used as heat sources (as in a chick incubator), but usually they are used for the purpose of providing light. As such, they are very inefficient, because most of the radiant energy they emit is invisible infrared. A compact fluorescent lamp can provide light comparable to a 60 watt incandescent while consuming as little as 15 watts of electricity.

The lumen is the photometric unit of light output. Although most consumers still think of light in terms of power consumed by the bulb, in the U.S. it has been a trade requirement for several decades that light bulb packaging give the output in lumens. The package of a 60 watt incandescent bulb indicates that it provides about 900 lumens, as does the package of the 15 watt compact fluorescent.

The lumen is defined as amount of light given into one steradian by a point source of one candela strength; while the candela, a base SI unit, is defined as the luminous intensity of a source of monochromatic radiation, of frequency 540 terahertz, and a radiant intensity of 1/683 watts per steradian. (540 THz corresponds to about 555 nanometres, the wavelength, in the green, to which the human eye is most sensitive. The number 1/683 was chosen to make the candela about equal to the standard candle, the unit which it superseded).

Combining these definitions, we see that 1/683 watt of 555 nanometre green light provides one lumen.

The relation between watts and lumens is not just a simple scaling factor. We know this already, because the 60 watt incandescent bulb and the 15 watt compact fluorescent can both provide 900 lumens.

The definition tells us that 1 watt of pure green 555 nm light is &quot;worth&quot; 683 lumens. It does not say anything about other wavelengths. Because lumens are photometric units, their relationship to watts depends on the wavelength according to how visible the wavelength is. Infrared and ultraviolet radiation, for example, are invisible and do not count. One watt of infrared radiation (which is where most of the radiation from an incandescent bulb falls) is worth zero lumens. Within the visible spectrum, wavelengths of light are weighted according to a function called the &quot;photopic spectral luminous efficiency.&quot; According to this function, 700 nm red light is only about 0.4% as efficient as 555 nm green light. Thus, one watt of 700 nm red light is &quot;worth&quot; only 2.7 lumens.

Because of the summation over the visual portion of the EM spectrum that is part of this weighting, the unit of &quot;lumen&quot; is color-blind: there is no way to tell what color a lumen will appear. This is equivalent to evaluating groceries by number of bags: there is no information about the specific content, just a number that refers to the total weighted quantity.

==Photometric measurement techniques==
Photometric measurement is based on photodetectors, devices (of several types) that produce an electric signal when exposed to light. Simple applications of this technology include switching luminaires on and off based on ambient light conditions, and light meters, used to measure the total amount of light incident on a point.

More complex forms of photometric measurement are used frequently within the lighting industry. Spherical photometers can be used to measure the directional luminous flux produced by lamps, and consist of a large-diameter globe with a lamp mounted at its center. A photocell rotates about the lamp in three axes, measuring the output of the lamp from all sides.

Lamps and lighting fixtures are tested using goniophotometers and rotating mirror photometers, which keep the photocell stationary at a sufficient distance that the luminaire can be considered a point source. Rotating mirror photometers use a motorized system of mirrors to reflect light emanating from the luminaire in all directions to the distant photocell; goniophotometers use a rotating 2-axis table to change the orientation of the luminaire with respect to the photocell. In either case, luminous intensity is tabulated from this data and used in lighting design.

<text>A national library is established by the government of a nation to serve as the pre-eminent repository of information for that country. Unlike public libraries, they rarely allow citizens to borrow books. Often, they include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works; such as the Gutenberg Bible. National libraries are usually notable for their size, compared to that of other libraries in the same country. Some national libraries may be thematic or specialized in some specific domains, beside or in replacement of the &#x27;main&#x27; national library.

Some national entities, which are not independent but wish to preserve their particular culture, have established a national library with all the attributes of such institutions, such as legal deposit.

Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards and carry out projects helping them to fulfil their duties. National libraries of Europe participate in The European Library. This is a service of The Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).

The list below is organized alphabetically by country, according to the list of sovereign states, including, at its end an &#x27;other states&#x27; section for non-sovereign states. A &quot;♦&quot; indicates a national library of a province or state, or constituent country or dependent state . It is listed under the sovereign state which governs that entity. Sovereign states are listed even when they have no national library or when the existence and name of a national library could not yet be ascertained. Other states, constituent countries and dependent states are listed only if they have a national library.

<text>The yellow tang (Zebrasoma flavescens), also known as the lemon sailfin, yellow sailfin tang or somber surgeonfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Acanthuridae which includes the surgeonfishes, unicornfishes and tangs. Bright yellow in color, it is one of the most popular marine aquarium fish, though in its natural state, it lives in reefs. The yellow tang spawns around a full moon, eats algae, and has a white barb, located just before the tail fin, to protect itself.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The yellow tang was first formally described by English naturalist Edward Turner Bennett as &quot;Acanthurus flavescens&quot; in 1828 from a collection in the Hawaiian Islands. &quot;Zebrasoma&quot; refers to the body and the zebra-like stripes or bars on the body of the type species the genus, the sailfin tang (&quot;Z. velifer&quot;). Its species name is the Latin adjective , which refers to the tang&#x27;s yellow color.

Within the genus &quot;Zebrasoma&quot; the yellow tang forms a species pair with the scopas tang (&quot;Z. scopas&quot;). The genera &quot;Zebrasoma&quot; is one of two genera that make up the tribe Zebrasomini within the subfamily Acanthurinae of the family Acanthuridae.

== Evolution and genetics ==
Based on the gene Cytochrome C-oxidase 1 (CO1), a group of researchers was able to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of the genus &quot;Zebrasoma&quot; with mitochondrial barcoding sequences.

==Description and biology==
Adult fish can grow to in length, and in thickness. Adult males tend to be larger than females. Yellow tangs are bright yellow in color. At night, the yellow coloring fades slightly, and a prominent brownish patch develops in the middle with a horizontal white band. They rapidly regain their bright yellow color during daylight. They can be aggressive, are prone to marine ich, and may damage coral within a reef tank. Male and female yellow tang look very similar. When mating, however, males change color and have a &quot;shimmering&quot; behavior which makes them identifiable. The yellow tang has 5 dorsal spines along with 23–26 dorsal soft rays. The yellow tang also has 3 anal spines as well as 19–22 anal soft rays. There is a white spine on its caudal peduncle that it can use for defense. Its snout is moderately protruding. Its mouth is small with spatulate teeth that are place classed relatively close together inside of the yellow tang&#x27;s mouth. In juveniles, there are 12 upper and 14 lower teeth. In adults, there are 18 upper and 22 lower teeth.

The yellow tang is a marine fish that lives in reefs and is typically found by itself or in small groups/schools. It is mainly herbivorous and eats filamentous algae.

== Reproduction ==
Spawning happens throughout the year, and it peaks once, normally occurring around the time the moon is full, so this suggests there is some sort of lunar periodicity to the spawning behavior. Spawning happens in pairs or groups, and fertilization is external. Eggs are left in open water and yellow tang are substratum egg scatterers. Yellow tang do not guard their eggs, and once the eggs hatch, the juveniles receive no parental care.

==Food==
In the wild, yellow tangs feed on benthic turf algae and other marine plant material. In captivity, they are commonly fed meat/fish-based aquarium food, but the long-term health effects of this diet are questionable. However, most experts in the marine aquarium industry express little scepticism that such a well rounded and balanced diet including plant and animal material would be in any way detrimental to mostly herbivorous fishes like tangs since they still need on occasion, complex amino acids and nutrients that only ocean animals can provide. In the wild, yellow tangs provide cleaner services to marine turtles, by removing algal growth from their shells.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is commonly found in shallow reefs, from deep, in the Pacific Ocean (Ryukyu, Mariana, Marshall, Marcus, Wake, and Hawaiian islands), west of Hawaii and east of Japan. There have also been reports that they have been found off the coast of Florida in the Western Central Atlantic. A single specimen was filmed in the Mediterranean Sea in spanish waters in 2008, a likely aquarium release. As of July of 2024, yellow tangs have been spotted several times on the shallow reefs of Mexico’s Riviera Maya.

Their habitat is tropical with a temperature range of . Hawaii was the most common place for aquarium harvesting, prior to the export ban, where up to 70% of the yellow tangs for the aquarium industry were sourced from. Over 70% of the yellow tang&#x27;s natural range is protected from collection and fishing. The yellow tang is listed as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

== Predators and other threats ==
The yellow tang has many natural predators, including larger fish, sharks, crabs, and octopuses. Another threat is habitat destruction that is caused by humans. Examples of habitat destruction caused by humans are pollution that started on land and flows into the water, physical damage and destruction from harmful fishing practices, as well as overfishing, coral harvesting, and snorkeling, which can potentially cause reef damage.

== Conservation status ==
Conservation status is labelled as least concern, but there are many ways yellow tang are being protected. The most prominent is that yellow tangs are being bred in captivity for aquarium use now more than they were, so collecting yellow tang from the ocean has decreased sharply. This allows wild yellow tang to be able to thrive without too many being taken, so the species is more likely to survive.

In 2010, one study found that fish larvae can drift on ocean currents and reseed fish stocks at a distant location. This finding demonstrated that fish populations can be connected to distant locations through the process of larval drift. They investigated the yellow tang, because larva of this species stay in the general area of the reef in which they first settle. The tropical yellow tang is heavily fished by the aquarium trade. By the late 1990s, their stocks were collapsing. Nine MPAs were established off the coast of Hawaii to protect them. Larval drift has helped them establish themselves in different locations, and the fishery is recovering. &quot;We&#x27;ve clearly shown that fish larvae that were spawned inside marine reserves can drift with currents and replenish fished areas long distances away,&quot; said coauthor Mark Hixon.

==In the aquarium==
The yellow tang is very commonly kept as a saltwater aquarium fish. In 2015, researchers successfully bred them in captivity. Captive-bred yellow tangs are now routinely available for purchase at fish stores and online vendors. They can grow up to in the wild, but are introduced to aquariums in the range. Some specimens as large as are occasionally available. Life expectancy in the wild can exceed 30 years.

Prior to January 2021, yellow tangs were commonly selling for around $65 to $70 in the US. However, after a collection ban in Hawaii, the prices have more than quadrupled to over $400.

<text>The Lammermuirs are a range of hills in southern Scotland, forming a natural boundary between East Lothian and the Borders. The name &quot;Lammermuir&quot; comes from the Old English , meaning &#x27;moorland of the lambs&#x27;.

== Geology ==
The Lammermuir Hills are formed from a succession of Silurian and Ordovician age marine sediments known as greywackes together with siltstones, shales and mudstones. They are assigned to the Gala Group. Unconformably overlying these highly faulted and folded strata are outcrops of the early Devonian age Great Conglomerate Formation which forms a part of the Reston Group of Old Red Sandstone rocks. These coarse red-purple conglomerates underlie a band of country in the east between Longformacus and Oldhamstocks and also occur in an isolated outcrop east of Soutra Hill and beneath the Dun Law Wind Farm on the western margin of the hills. The same strata extend down Lauderdale on the western margin of the hills.

Numerous dykes of different lithologies largely of Devonian age but some of Carboniferous age and with a generally NE-SW alignment occur throughout the area. The Priestlaw Intrusion is a mass of late Silurian/early Devonian granite which occurs in the area of Whiteadder Reservoir.

Glacial meltwater channels are common along the northern and eastern margins of the hills, with a notable group beneath Newlands Hill and Dod Law to the southeast of Gifford and north of Deuchrie Edge and Lothian Edge, largely directed towards the northeast in these areas.

==Geography==
Spanning the counties of Selkirk, East Lothian, and Berwick, the Lammermuirs extend from the Gala Water to St Abb&#x27;s Head, and offer a traditional site for sheep grazing. The hills are nowhere especially high, the highest points being Meikle Says Law at and the Lammer Law at ; but steep gradients, exposure to the elements, and a lack of natural passes combine to form a formidable barrier to communications between Edinburgh and the Borders.

The hills are crossed by only one major road (the A68), which crosses the shoulder of Soutra Hill between Lauder and Pathhead, and is frequently closed by snow in winter. The main road linking Edinburgh to England (the A1) avoids the hills by following a circuitous route around the coast.

==Features==
White Castle was an Iron Age hill fort, settled by the ancestors of the Votadini tribe.

Crystal Rig Wind Farm is located on the hills.

==Historical and literary significance==
The Northumbrian missionary bishop Cuthbert spent his early years as a shepherd on the Lammermuir Hills.

Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot; and Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s derivative opera &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; is set here. Scott lived at Abbotsford House, near Galashiels.

Two ranges of hills in New Zealand, the Lammermoors and Lammerlaws, are named after the Scottish hills.

<text>The model year (sometimes abbreviated as MY) is a method of describing the version of a product which has been produced over multiple years. The model year may or may not be the same as the calendar year in which the product was manufactured.

==Automobiles==
=== United States and Canada ===
Automobiles in the United States and Canada are identified and regulated by model year, whereas other markets use production date (month/year) to identify specific vehicles, and model codes in place of the &quot;year&quot; (model year) in the North American make-model-year identifier.

In technical documents generated within the auto industry and its regulating agencies such as the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and United States Environmental Protection Agency and Transport Canada and Environment Canada, the letters &quot;MY&quot; often precede the year (as in &quot;MY2019&quot; or &quot;MY93&quot;). Even without this prefix, however, in the North American context it is usually the model year rather than the vehicle&#x27;s calendar year of production that is being referred to.

The new model year typically begins in August to September of the preceding calendar year, though can be as early as February, such being the case for the fourth generation 2022 Acura MDX, which started production in January 2021. This was partly due to the advertising of a new model being coordinated with the launch of the new television season in late September, because of the heavy dependence between television to offer products from automakers to advertise, and the car companies to launch their new models at a high-profile time of year. Imported cars use the model year convention in the U.S. and Canada, even when this system is not used for the same cars when sold in other countries.

The concept of yearly styling updates (a practice adopted from the fashion industry) was introduced to General Motors&#x27; range of cars by Alfred P. Sloan in the 1920s. This was an early form of planned obsolescence in the car industry, where yearly styling changes meant consumers could easily discern a car&#x27;s newness, or lack of it. Other major changes to the model range usually coincided with the launch of the new model year., for example the 1928 model year of the Ford Model A began production in October 1927 and the 1955 model year of the Ford Thunderbird began production in September 1954.

Model year followed with calendar year until the mid 1930s until then president Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an executive order to release vehicle model years in the fall of the preceding year in order to standardize employment in the automotive industry. The practice of beginning production of next year&#x27;s model before the end of the year has become a long-standing tradition in America.

For purposes such as VINs and emissions control, regulations allow cars of a given model year to be sold starting on January 2 of the previous calendar year. For example, a 2019 model year vehicle can legally go on sale starting January 2, 2018. This has resulted in a few cars in the following model year being introduced in advertisements during the NFL Super Bowl in February. A notable example of an early model year launch would be the Ford Mustang, introduced as an early 1965 model (informally referred to as &quot;1964&quot;) in April 1964
at the World&#x27;s Fair, several months before the usual start of the 1965 model year in August 1964.

For recreational vehicles, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission allows a manufacturer to use a model year up to two years before the date that the vehicle was manufactured.

=== Other countries ===

In other countries, it is more common to identify specific vehicles by their year and month of production, and cars of a particular type by their generation, using terms such as &quot;Mark III&quot; or by the manufacturer&#x27;s code for that kind of car (such as &quot;BL&quot; being the code for a Mazda 3 built between November 2008 and June 2013).

In Europe, the lesser use of model years as a descriptor is partly because since the 1980s many vehicles are introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March, the Frankfurt Motor Show in September or the Paris Motor Show in September. New models have increasingly been launched in June or July.

As with the rest of Europe, the motor industry in the United Kingdom did not regularly make use of model years in the way common in the US, since cars were not as regularly updated or altered. Some exceptions existed; for instance in the 1950s and 1960s the Rootes Group deliberately copied American practice and performed annual small alterations to its key models such as the Hillman Minx and the Humber Super Snipe. However these were still not identified by model years but by Series numbers, sometimes with alphabetical designations (such as the Minx Series IIIA, IIIB and IIIC) to distinguish what were mostly cosmetic updates rather than mechanical or structural improvements. As in America, the British motor industry did generally announce new models (or updates to existing ones) in September. However this was the norm long before it became practice in the US and did not originate with the television season. Instead it began because the long-established practice in the manufacturing industries of the English Midlands, especially Coventry and Birmingham where the British car industry developed out of the established bicycle and machine tool trades, was to close factories and give workers a two-week holiday in August or September. This was used as a chance to renew tooling in the factory and was an ideal time to introduce new products which would begin production when the workers returned and the factory restarted. Thus the working year in the car industry ran from September to September. New or improved models would be announced in the summer and would be displayed at the British Motor Show which was held in October. Here they would be seen by the wider industry and buying public for the first time, just as the cars produced in the previous weeks began reaching the dealerships ready for sale. Therefore, car models intended for sale during, say, 1960, would be announced and displayed in the third quarter of 1959, with sales beginning before the end of the year, and any improvements intended for 1961 would be announced in September 1960 and displayed at the 1960 Motor Show in October.

This convention was not absolute; for instance the original Vauxhall Victor was officially announced in February 1957 with sales beginning later the same month, and subsequent additions and updates to the Victor range were all introduced in February - notably Vauxhall&#x27;s factory was outside the traditional centre of the industry, being in Luton, and so did not follow the common working calendar. Being owned by General Motors, Vauxhall also generally made minor changes to its cars year by year, even referring to &#x27;model years&#x27; in some of its literature, but these did not have the same official weight or significant to buyers as they did in America. During the 1960s British car makers began giving journalists access to upcoming models earlier in the year to get announcements out ahead of their rivals and clear of the busy September period. This developed into increasingly lavish and sophisticated media and marketing events happening earlier and earlier in the year. Changes to working practices, the in-roads made to the British market by car makers from other countries and the decline in market share by British firms finally led to the tradition of new models being introduced in September being abandoned, although the British Motor Show continued to be held in October.

=== VIN encoding ===

The standardized format of the vehicle identification number (VIN) used in the United States and Canada includes the model year of the vehicle as the 10th digit. The actual date that the vehicle was produced is not part of the VIN, but it is required to be shown on the vehicle safety certification label.

In addition to automobiles, some other products that often have model years include:

<text>Vegetable sandwich is a type of vegetarian sandwich consisting of a vegetable filling between bread. There are no set requirements other than the use of vegetables, and sandwiches may be toasted or untoasted. Vegetable sandwiches are served throughout the world and are a popular street food in India.

==Cucumber sandwich==
The cucumber sandwich originated in the UK. They are traditionally served with afternoon tea and on formal occasions. The cucumber is expected to be sliced as thinly as possible. The slices in a well presented cucumber sandwich should pass daylight.

== Mumbai vegetable sandwich ==

The Mumbai vegetable sandwich, previously and still occasionally known as the Bombay vegetable sandwich, is a common street food in India, especially in Mumbai. The sandwich is made with Western style bread and is usually toasted. The main ingredients are a spicy green chutney spread, tomatoes, onions, cucumber, and a spicy potato filling made with chaat masala or a similar spice mix. Other ingredients sometimes included are cooked beetroot and cheese. The sandwich is a popular student lunch.

== Rainbow vegetable sandwich ==
The idea of the rainbow vegetable sandwich is to layer the vegetables in different colours to create a spectrum of colours. These can sometimes be constructed unfeasibly high in order to include the maximum number of different colours and textures.

<text>George Hersee (29 December 1924 – 11 April 2001) was a BBC engineer, who is most famous for his development of Test Card F. This design came about after Hersee was asked to intervene by the committee charged with the creation of technical standards for the new colour TV services.

Hersee was born in Sussex, England. He was educated at Chichester Boys School and attended the University of Southampton, where he studied electrical engineering. In 1949, he joined the BBC&#x27;s Planning &amp; Installation Department, which equipped the BBC studios. By the late 1950s, he was specialising in lens and test card transparency specifications and became one of the leaders in this new field. 

The BBC had first begun to use television test cards in the 1930s, and by the mid 1960s it was realised that a new colour card was required, with particular attention being paid to the accuracy of skin tones. Hersee&#x27;s now-iconic &quot;Test Card F&quot; from 1967 features a photograph of Carole, his eldest daughter, to meet that requirement.

Hersee published a monograph in 1967 entitled &quot;A Survey of the Development of Television Test Cards Used in the BBC&quot;, but left the BBC in 1979 to work for a private engineering company.

He died at age 76, and was survived by his wife and two daughters, Carole and Gillian.

<text>The University of Canberra (UC) is a public research university with its main campus located in Bruce, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. The campus is from Belconnen Town Centre, and from Canberra&#x27;s Civic Centre. UC offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses through five faculties: Arts and Design; Business, Government and Law; Education; Health; and Science and Technology.

==History==
The University of Canberra was first established in 1967 as the Canberra College of Advanced Education. It then became the University of Canberra under sponsorship of Monash University in 1990. 

=== Foundation stone ===
The foundation stone was unveiled by Prime Minister John Gorton on 28 October 1968. The stone is displayed near Building 1 on the Bruce campus. The inscription reads:

=== Stonefest ===
An annual celebration, called Stone Day, was first held in 1971. It has since evolved into a popular music festival. Stone Day traditionally took place after classes finished at the end of Semester 2, but before exams. The day before was known as Stone Eve. Stone Day involved a music festival with local bands. 

Over the years, the Stone Day program grew larger, expanding to a whole week in 1976, and became Stoneweek. In the 1980s and 1990s, Stoneweek was a popular Canberra entertainment event and one of Australia&#x27;s most popular music festivals. In 2000, the festival became Stonefest.

Beginning in 2012, Stonefest was not held for a number of years at the University of Canberra. In 2014, UC created a mini-music Stonefest festival with a DJ and numerous activities, however it was not received well. In 2019, Stonefest returned, with both local and international acts, but did not run in 2020–2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, returning in 2022.

== Campuses and buildings ==

=== Bruce ===


The university&#x27;s main campus is located in the suburb of Bruce and covers of buildings, ovals, gardens, lawns, car parks, roads, walkways, and sculptures. The campus is notable for its native gardens and the presence of kangaroos. There are over 29 buildings dedicated to teaching, research, and administration for the disciplines, faculties and business units. These buildings are concentrated around the main concourse. Each building is numbered and many do not hold any title or namesake. At the northern end of the campus is the University of Canberra Hospital which focuses on rehabilitation.

====Facilities====
The Refectory is located in Building 1, operated by UCX (the student union). It provides a food court, general shop, pool tables, and lounges, and is also a concert venue. Upstairs there are study rooms which can be booked by students and staff.

The Hub is located under the main concourse, providing a café, hairdressing salon, tattoo parlour, 87.8 UCFM student radio station studio, and social enterprise hub. A bar, convenience store, and several eateries are also available near the student residences.

A sport and fitness centre is located in Building 29 with gym facilities and is home to Brumbies Rugby administration. There are basketball and squash courts nearby in Building 4, and various sporting ovals.

===Other sites===
The university has satellite campuses in the following locations:
* Queensland
** TAFE Queensland Brisbane (South Bank)
** TAFE Queensland Brisbane (Mount Gravatt)
* Sydney
** University of Canberra Sydney Hills campus (Castle Hill)
** TAFE NSW Northern Sydney (RTO)

==Governance and structure==
===University Council===

The governing body of the University of Canberra is its University Council. The current chancellor is Lisa Paul, , a former senior Australian public servant and policymaker who was a long-serving Secretary of the Department of Education and Training.

Professor Stephen Parker is the interim vice-chancellor (VC), having previously served as VC 2007–2016. Parker took over from Professor Lucy Johnston who was the interim VC following the sudden departure of Professor Paddy Nixon who served as VC from 6 April 2020 to 15 December 2023. The incoming VC, from February 2025, is Bill Shorten. Prior to Professor Nixon, Professor Deep Saini was VC from 1 September 2016 to 21 December 2019.

===Faculties and departments===
The five faculties are:

;Arts and Design
Arts and design specialises in architecture, landscape architecture, graphic design, communication studies, culture and heritage, journalism, creative writing and poetry, international studies, and media arts. The faculty has two schools: School of Design and the Built Environment and School of Arts and Communication.

;Business, Government and Law
The Business Government and Law Faculty provides courses in accounting, applied economics, business administration, business informatics, construction, economics, finance, law, management, marketing, politics, sociology, public policy, tourism, and urban and regional planning. The Faculty has three schools: Canberra Business School, Canberra Law School, and Canberra School of Politics, Economics &amp; Society.

; Education
The Education faculty offers courses designed to cover all stages of teacher development with courses in early childhood, primary and secondary.

;Health
The Faculty of Health prepares a wide range of allied health professionals, including in counselling, exercise science, nursing and midwifery, nutrition and dietetics, occupational therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physiotherapy and exercise physiology and rehabilitation, psychology, medical imaging, speech pathology, and sports management.

;Science and Technology 
The Faculty of Science and Technology trains students in environmental sciences, biomedical and forensic as well as information technology, information systems, engineering, and mathematics. The Faculty has two schools: School of Science and the School of Information Technology and Systems.

===Finances===
Like most Australian universities, University of Canberra derives the majority of its revenue from the Australian Government through the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, student fees, research grants and contracts, commercial activities, and donations. The ACT Government provides around one percent of the university&#x27;s operating budget.

The University&#x27;s budget in 2022 was 312.84 million (2022). In 2024, the University of Canberra is expecting a $36 million deficit which triggered emergency spending constraints. The deficit is partly attributed to a decline in international student enrolments. The financial situation lead to the announcement in October 2024 of urgent and significant cost-saving measures, including an estimated 200 job cuts by the middle of 2025.

<doc id="426955" wikidata="Q272870" url="?curid=426955" title="Car suspension">
<text>Suspension is the system of tires, tire air, springs, shock absorbers and linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels and allows relative motion between the two. Suspension systems must support both road holding/handling and ride quality, which are at odds with each other. The tuning of suspensions involves finding the right compromise. The suspension is crucial for maintaining consistent contact between the road wheel and the road surface, as all forces exerted on the vehicle by the road or ground are transmitted through the tires&#x27; contact patches. The suspension also protects the vehicle itself and any cargo or luggage from damage and wear. The design of front and rear suspension of a car may be different.

==History==

An early form of suspension on ox-drawn carts had the platform swing on iron chains attached to the wheeled frame of the carriage. This system remained the basis for most suspension systems until the turn of the 19th century, although the iron chains were replaced with the use of leather straps called thoroughbraces by the 17th century. No modern automobiles have used the thoroughbrace suspension system.

By approximately 1750, leaf springs began appearing on certain types of carriage, such as the Landau.

By the middle of the 19th century, elliptical springs might additionally start to be used on carriages.

===Modern suspension===

Automobiles were initially developed as self-propelled versions of horse-drawn vehicles. However, horse-drawn vehicles had been designed for relatively slow speeds, and their suspension was not well suited to the higher speeds permitted by the internal combustion engine.

The first workable spring-suspension required advanced metallurgical knowledge and skill, and only became possible with the advent of industrialisation. Obadiah Elliott registered the first patent for a spring-suspension vehicle; each wheel had two durable steel leaf springs on each side and the body of the carriage was fixed directly to the springs which were attached to the axles. Within a decade, most British horse carriages were equipped with springs; wooden springs in the case of light one-horse vehicles to avoid taxation, and steel springs in larger vehicles. These were often made of low-carbon steel and usually took the form of multiple layer leaf springs.

Leaf springs have been around since the early Egyptians. Ancient military engineers used leaf springs in the form of bows to power their siege engines, with little success at first. The use of leaf springs in catapults was later refined and made to work years later. Springs were not only made of metal; a sturdy tree branch could be used as a spring, such as with a bow. Horse-drawn carriages and Ford Model T used this system, and it is still used today in larger vehicles, mainly mounted in the rear suspension.

Leaf springs were the first modern suspension system, and, along with advances in the construction of roads, heralded the single greatest improvement in road transport until the advent of the automobile. The British steel springs were not well-suited for use on America&#x27;s rough roads of the time, so the Abbot-Downing Company of Concord, New Hampshire re-introduced leather strap suspension, which gave a swinging motion instead of the jolting up-and-down of spring suspension.

In 1901, Mors of Paris first fitted an automobile with shock absorbers. With the advantage of a damped suspension system on his &#x27;Mors Machine&#x27;, Henri Fournier won the prestigious Paris-to-Berlin race on 20 June 1901. Fournier&#x27;s superior time was 11 hours 46 minutes and 10 seconds, while the best competitor was Léonce Girardot in a Panhard with a time of 12 hours, 15 minutes, and 40 seconds.

Coil springs first appeared on a production vehicle in 1906 in the Brush Runabout made by the Brush Motor Company.
Today, coil springs are used in most cars.

In 1920, Leyland Motors used torsion bars in a suspension system.

In 1922, independent front suspension was pioneered on Lancia Lambda, and became more common in mass market cars from 1932. Today, most cars have independent suspension on all four wheels.

The part on which pre-1950 springs were supported is called a dumb iron.

In 2002, a new passive suspension component, the inerter, was invented by Malcolm C. Smith. This has the ability to increase the effective inertia of wheel suspension using a geared flywheel, but without adding significant mass. It was initially employed in Formula One in secrecy, but has since spread to wider motorsport.

==Difference between rear suspension and front suspension==


For front-wheel drive cars, rear suspension has few constraints, and a variety of beam axles and independent suspensions are used. For rear-wheel drive cars, rear suspension has many constraints, and the development of the superior, but more expensive independent suspension layout has been difficult.

===History===
Henry Ford&#x27;s Model T used a torque tube to restrain this force, for his differential was attached to the chassis by a lateral leaf spring and two narrow rods. The torque tube surrounded the true driveshaft and exerted the force to its ball joint at the extreme rear of the transmission, which was attached to the engine. A similar method like this was used in the late 1930s by Buick and by Hudson&#x27;s &quot;bathtub car&quot; in 1948, which used helical springs that could not take fore-and-aft thrust.

The Hotchkiss drive, invented by Albert Hotchkiss, was the most popular rear suspension system used in American cars from the 1930s to the 1970s. The system uses longitudinal leaf springs attached both forward and behind the differential of the live axle. These springs transmit torque to the frame. Although scorned by many European car makers of the time, it was accepted by American car makers, because it was inexpensive to manufacture. Also, the dynamic defects of this design were suppressed by the enormous weight of U.S. passenger vehicles before the implementation of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard.

Another Frenchman invented the De Dion tube, which is sometimes called &quot;semi-independent&quot;. Like true independent rear suspension, this employs two universal joints, or their equivalent from the centre of the differential to each wheel. But the wheels cannot entirely rise and fall independently of each other; they are tied by a yoke that goes around the differential, below and behind it. This method has had little use in the United States. Its use around 1900 was probably due to the poor quality of tires, which wore out quickly. By removing a good deal of unsprung weight, as independent rear suspensions do, it made them last longer.

Rear-wheel drive vehicles today frequently use a fairly complex fully-independent, multi-link suspension to locate the rear wheels securely, while providing decent ride quality.

==Spring, wheel, and roll rates==

===Spring rate===
The spring rate (or suspension rate) is a component in setting the vehicle&#x27;s ride height or its location in the suspension stroke. When a spring is compressed or stretched, the force it exerts, is proportional to its change in length. The &quot;spring rate&quot; or &quot;spring constant&quot; of a spring is the change in the force it exerts, divided by the change in deflection of the spring. Vehicles that carry heavy loads, will often have heavier springs to compensate for the additional weight that would otherwise collapse a vehicle to the bottom of its travel (stroke). Heavier springs are also used in performance applications, where the loading conditions experienced are more significant.

Springs that are too hard or too soft cause the suspension to become ineffective – mostly because they fail to properly isolate the vehicle from the road. Vehicles that commonly experience suspension loads heavier than normal, have heavy or hard springs, with a spring rate close to the upper limit for that vehicle&#x27;s weight. This allows the vehicle to perform properly under a heavy load, when control is limited by the inertia of the load. Riding in an empty truck meant for carrying loads can be uncomfortable for passengers, because of its high spring rate relative to the weight of the vehicle. A race car could also be described as having heavy springs, and would also be uncomfortably bumpy. However, even though we say they both have heavy springs, the actual spring rates for a racecar and a truck are very different. A luxury car, taxi, or passenger bus would be described as having soft springs, for the comfort of their passengers or driver. Vehicles with worn-out or damaged springs ride lower to the ground, which reduces the overall amount of compression available to the suspension, and increases the amount of body lean. Performance vehicles can sometimes have spring rate requirements other than vehicle weight and load.

===Wheel rate===
Wheel rate is the effective spring rate when measured at the wheel, as opposed to simply measuring the spring rate alone.

Wheel rate is usually equal to or considerably less than the spring rate. Commonly, springs are mounted on control arms, swing arms or some other pivoting suspension member. Consider the example above, where the spring rate was calculated to be 500 lbs/inch (87.5 N/mm), if one were to move the wheel (without moving the car), the spring more than likely compresses a smaller amount. If the spring moved , the lever arm ratio would be 0.75:1. The wheel rate is calculated by taking the square of the ratio (0.5625) times the spring rate, thus obtaining 281.25 lbs/inch (49.25 N/mm). The ratio is squared because it has two effects on the wheel rate: it applies to both the force and the distance traveled.

Wheel rate on independent suspension is fairly straightforward. However, special consideration must be taken with some non-independent suspension designs. Take the case of the straight axle. When viewed from the front or rear, the wheel rate can be measured by the means above. Yet, because the wheels are not independent, when viewed from the side under acceleration or braking, the pivot point is at infinity (because both wheels have moved) and the spring is directly inline with the wheel contact patch. The result is often, that the effective wheel rate under cornering is different from what it is under acceleration and braking. This variation in wheel rate may be minimised by locating the spring as close to the wheel as possible.

Wheel rates are usually summed and compared with the sprung mass of a vehicle to create a &quot;ride rate&quot; and the corresponding suspension natural frequency in ride (also referred to as &quot;heave&quot;). This can be useful in creating a metric for suspension stiffness and travel requirements for a vehicle.

===Roll rate===
Roll rate is analogous to a vehicle&#x27;s ride rate, but for actions that include lateral accelerations, causing a vehicle&#x27;s sprung mass to roll. It is expressed as torque per degree of roll of the vehicle sprung mass. It is influenced by factors including but not limited to vehicle sprung mass, track width, CG height, spring and damper rates, roll centre heights of front and rear, anti-roll bar stiffness and tire pressure/construction. The roll rate of a vehicle can, and usually, does differ front-to-rear, which allows for the tuning ability of a vehicle for transient and steady-state handling. The roll rate of a vehicle does not change the total amount of weight transfer on the vehicle, but shifts the speed and percentage of weight transferred on a particular axle to another axle through the vehicle chassis. Generally, the higher the roll rate on an axle of a vehicle, the faster and higher percentage the weight transfer on that axle.

By 2021, some vehicles were offering dynamic roll control with ride-height adjustable air suspension and adaptive dampers.

===Roll couple percentage===
Roll couple percentage is a simplified method of describing lateral load transfer distribution front to rear, and subsequently handling balance. It is the effective wheel rate, in roll, of each axle of the vehicle as a ratio of the vehicle&#x27;s total roll rate. It is commonly adjusted through the use of anti-roll bars, but can also be changed through the use of different springs.

==Weight transfer==

Weight transfer during cornering, acceleration, or braking is usually calculated per individual wheel, and compared with the static weights for the same wheels.

The total amount of weight transfer is only affected by four factors: the distance between wheel centers (wheelbase in the case of braking, or track width in the case of cornering), the height of the center of gravity, the mass of the vehicle, and the amount of acceleration experienced.

The speed at which weight transfer occurs, as well as through which components it transfers, is complex, and is determined by many factors; including, but not limited to: roll center height, spring and damper rates, anti-roll bar stiffness, and the kinematic design of suspension links.

In most conventional applications, when weight is transferred through intentionally compliant elements, such as springs, dampers, and anti-roll bars, the weight transfer is said to be &quot;elastic&quot;, while the weight which is transferred through more rigid suspension links, such as A-arms and toe links, is said to be &quot;geometric&quot;.

===Unsprung weight transfer===
Unsprung weight transfer is calculated based on weight of the vehicle&#x27;s components that are not supported by the springs. This includes tires, wheels, brakes, spindles, half the control arm&#x27;s weight, and other components. These components are then (for calculation purposes) assumed to be connected to a vehicle with zero sprung weight. They are then put through the same dynamic loads.

The weight transfer for cornering in the front would be equal to the total unsprung front weight times the G-force times the front unsprung center of gravity height divided by the front track width. The same is true for the rear.

===Sprung weight transfer===

Sprung weight transfer is the weight transferred by only the weight of the vehicle resting on its springs, and not by total vehicle weight. Calculating this requires knowing the vehicle&#x27;s sprung weight (total weight less the unsprung weight), the front and rear roll center heights, and the sprung center of gravity height (used to calculate the roll moment arm length). Calculating the front and rear sprung weight transfer will also require knowing the roll couple percentage.

The roll axis is the line through the front and rear roll centers that the vehicle rolls around during cornering. The distance from this axis to the sprung center of gravity height is the roll moment arm length. The total sprung weight transfer is equal to the G-force times the sprung weight times the roll moment arm length divided by the effective track width. The front sprung weight transfer is calculated by multiplying the roll couple percentage times the total sprung weight transfer. The rear is the total minus the front transfer.

===Jacking forces===

Jacking forces are the sum of the vertical force components experienced by suspension links. The resultant force acts to lift the sprung mass, if the roll center is above ground, or compress it, if underground. Generally, the higher the roll center, the more jacking force is experienced.

==Other properties==
===Travel===
Travel is the measure of distance from the bottom of the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle is on a jack, and the wheel hangs freely) to the top of the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle&#x27;s wheel can no longer travel in an upward direction toward the vehicle). Bottoming or lifting a wheel can cause serious control problems, or directly cause damage. &quot;Bottoming&quot; can be caused by the suspension, tires, fenders, etc. running out of space to move, or the body or other components of the car hitting the road. Control problems caused by lifting a wheel are less severe, if the wheel lifts when the spring reaches its unloaded shape than they are, if travel is limited by contact of suspension members (See Triumph TR3B.)

Many off-road vehicles, such as desert racers, use straps called &quot;limiting straps&quot; to limit the suspensions&#x27; downward travel to a point within safe limits for the linkages and shock absorbers. This is necessary, since these trucks are intended to travel over very rough terrain at high speeds, and even become airborne at times. Without something to limit the travel, the suspension bushings would take all the force, when suspension reaches &quot;full droop&quot;, and it can even cause the coil springs to come out of their &quot;buckets&quot;, if they are held in by compression forces only. A limiting strap is a simple strap, often from nylon of a predetermined length, that stops downward movement at a pre-set point before theoretical maximum travel is reached. The opposite of this is the &quot;bump-stop&quot;, which protects the suspension and the vehicle (as well as the occupants) from the violent &quot;bottoming&quot; of the suspension, caused when an obstruction (or a hard landing) causes suspension to run out of upward travel without fully absorbing the energy of the stroke. Without bump-stops, a vehicle that &quot;bottoms out&quot;, will experience a very hard shock when the suspension contacts the bottom of the frame or body, which is transferred to the occupants and every connector and weld on the vehicle. Factory vehicles often come with plain rubber &quot;nubs&quot; to absorb the worst of the forces, and insulate the shock. A desert race vehicle, which must routinely absorb far higher impact forces, might be provided with pneumatic or hydro-pneumatic bump-stops. These are essentially miniature shock absorbers (dampers) that are fixed to the vehicle in a location, such, that the suspension will contact the end of the piston when it nears the upward travel limit. These absorb the impact far more effectively than a solid rubber bump-stop will, essential, because a rubber bump-stop is considered a &quot;last-ditch&quot; emergency insulator for the occasional accidental bottoming of the suspension; it is entirely insufficient to absorb repeated and heavy bottoming, such as a high-speed off-road vehicle encounters.

===Damping===
Damping is the control of motion or oscillation, as seen with the use of hydraulic gates and valves in a vehicle&#x27;s shock absorber. This may also vary, intentionally or unintentionally. Like spring rate, the optimal damping for comfort may be less, than for control.

Damping controls the travel speed and resistance of the vehicle&#x27;s suspension. An undamped car will oscillate up and down. With proper damping levels, the car will settle back to a normal state in a minimal amount of time. Most damping in modern vehicles can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the resistance to fluid flow in the shock absorber.

===Camber control===
See dependent and independent below.
Camber changes due to wheel travel, body roll and suspension system deflection or compliance. In general, a tire wears and brakes best at -1 to -2° of camber from vertical. Depending on the tire and the road surface, it may hold the road best at a slightly different angle. Small changes in camber, front and rear, can be used to tune handling. Some racecars are tuned with -2 to -7° camber, depending on the type of handling desired, and tire construction. Often, too much camber will result in the decrease of braking performance due to a reduced contact patch size through excessive camber variation in suspension geometry. The amount of camber change in bump is determined by the instantaneous front view swing arm (FVSA) length of suspension geometry, or in other words, the tendency of the tire to camber inward when compressed in bump.

===Roll center height===
Roll center height is a product of suspension instant center heights and is a useful metric in analyzing weight transfer effects, body roll and front to rear roll stiffness distribution. Conventionally, roll stiffness distribution is tuned adjusting antiroll bars rather than roll center height (as both tend to have a similar effect on the sprung mass), but the height of the roll center is significant when considering the amount of jacking forces experienced.

===Instant center===
Due to the fact that the wheel and tire&#x27;s motion is constrained by the vehicle&#x27;s suspension links, the motion of the wheel package in the front view will scribe an imaginary arc in space with an &quot;instantaneous center&quot; of rotation at any given point along its path. The instant center for any wheel package can be found by following imaginary lines drawn through suspension links to their intersection point.

A component of the tire&#x27;s force vector points from the contact patch of the tire through instant center. The larger this component is, the less suspension motion will occur. Theoretically, if the &quot;resultant&quot; of the vertical load on the tire and the lateral force generated by it points directly into the instant center, the suspension links will not move. In this case, all weight transfer at that end of the vehicle will be geometric in nature. This is key information used in finding the force-based roll center as well.

In this respect, the instant centers are more important to the handling of the vehicle, than the kinematic roll center alone, in that the ratio of geometric-to-elastic weight transfer is determined by the forces at the tires and their directions in relation to the position of their respective instant centers.

===Anti-dive and anti-squat===
Anti-dive and anti-squat are percentages that indicate the degree to which the front dives under braking, and the rear squats under acceleration. They can be thought of as the counterparts for braking and acceleration, as jacking forces are to cornering. The main reason for the difference is due to the different design goals between front and rear suspension, whereas suspension is usually symmetrical between the left and the right of the vehicle.

The method of determining anti-dive or anti-squat depends on whether suspension linkages react to the torque of braking and accelerating. For example, with inboard brakes and half-shaft-driven rear wheels, the suspension linkages do not react, but with outboard brakes and a swing-axle driveline, they do.

To determine the percentage of front suspension braking anti-dive for outboard brakes, it is first necessary to determine the tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front tire patch and the front suspension instant center, and the horizontal. In addition, the percentage of braking effort at the front wheels must be known. Then, multiply the tangent by the front wheel braking effort percentage and divide by the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. A value of 50% would mean, that half of the weight transfer to the front wheels; during braking, it is being transmitted through front suspension linkage, and half is being transmitted through front suspension springs.

For inboard brakes, the same procedure is followed, but using the wheel center instead of contact patch center.

Forward acceleration anti-squat is calculated in a similar manner and with the same relationship between percentage and weight transfer. Anti-squat values of 100% and more are commonly used in drag racing, but values of 50% or less are more common in cars that have to undergo severe braking. Higher values of anti-squat commonly cause wheel hop during braking. It is important to note, that the value of 100% means, that all of the weight transfer is being carried through suspension linkage. However, this does not mean that the suspension is incapable of carrying additional loads (aerodynamic, cornering, etc.) during an episode of braking, or forward acceleration. In other words, no &quot;binding&quot; of the suspension is to be implied.

===Flexibility and vibration modes of suspension elements===
In some modern cars, flexibility is mainly in rubber bushings, which are subject to decay over time. For high-stress suspensions, such as off-road vehicles, polyurethane bushings are available, which offer more longevity under greater stresses. However, due to weight and cost considerations, structures are not made more rigid than necessary. Some vehicles exhibit detrimental vibrations involving the flexing of structural parts, such as when accelerating while turning sharply. Flexibility of structures, such as frames and suspension links, can also contribute to springing, especially to damping out high-frequency vibrations. The flexibility of wire wheels contributed to their popularity in times when cars had less advanced suspensions.

===Load levelling===
Automobiles can be heavily laden with luggage, passengers, and trailers. This loading will cause a vehicle&#x27;s tail to sink downwards. Maintaining a steady chassis level is essential to achieving the proper handling that the vehicle was designed for. Oncoming drivers can be blinded by the headlight beam. Self-levelling suspension counteracts this by inflating cylinders in the suspension to lift the chassis higher.

===Isolation from high frequency shock===
For most purposes, the weight of suspension components is unimportant. But at high frequencies caused by road surface roughness, the parts isolated by rubber bushings act as a multi-stage filter to suppress noise and vibration better than can be done with only tires and springs. (The springs work mainly in the vertical direction.)

===Contribution to unsprung weight and total weight===
These are usually small, except that the suspension is related to whether the brakes and are sprung.

This is the main functional advantage of aluminum wheels over steel wheels. Aluminum suspension parts have been used in production cars, and carbon fiber suspension parts are common in racing cars.

===Space occupied===
Designs differ as to how much space they take up, and where it is located. It is generally accepted, that MacPherson struts are the most compact arrangement for front-engined vehicles, where space between the wheels is required to place the engine.

Inboard brakes (which reduce unsprung weight) are probably avoided more due to space considerations than to cost.

===Force distribution===
The suspension attachment must match the frame design in geometry, strength and rigidity.

===Air resistance (drag)===
Certain modern vehicles have height adjustable suspension in order to improve aerodynamics and fuel efficiency. Modern formula cars that have exposed wheels and suspension typically use streamlined tubing rather than simple round tubing for their suspension arms to reduce aerodynamic drag. Also typical is the use of rocker-arm, push rod, or pull rod-type suspensions, that, among other things, place the spring/damper unit inboard and out of the air stream to further reduce air resistance.

===Cost===
Production methods improve, but cost is always a factor. The continued use of the solid rear axle, with unsprung differential, especially on heavy vehicles, seems to be the most obvious example.

==Springs and dampers==
Most conventional suspensions use passive springs to absorb impacts and dampers (or shock absorbers) to control spring motions.

Some notable exceptions are hydropneumatic systems, which can be treated as an integrated unit of gas spring and damping components, used by the French manufacturer Citroën; and the hydrolastic, hydragas and rubber cone systems used by the British Motor Corporation, most notably on the Mini. A number of different types of each have been used:

===Passive suspensions===
Traditional springs and dampers are referred to as passive suspensions — most vehicles are suspended in this manner.

====Springs====
The majority of land vehicles are suspended by steel springs of these types:
* Leaf spring – AKA Hotchkiss, Cart, or semi-elliptical spring
* Torsion bar suspension
* Coil spring

Automakers are aware of the inherent limitations of steel springs — that these springs tend to produce undesirable oscillations, and carmakers have developed other types of suspension materials and mechanisms in attempts to improve performance:
* Rubber bushings
* Gas under pressure - air springs
* Gas and hydraulic fluid under pressure - hydropneumatic suspension and oleo struts

====Dampers or shock absorbers====
Shock absorbers damp out the (otherwise simple harmonic) motions of a vehicle up and down on its springs. They must also damp out much of the wheel bounce when the unsprung weight of a wheel, hub, axle, and sometimes brakes and the differential bounces up and down on the springiness of a tire.

===Semi-active and active suspensions===

If suspension is externally controlled, then it is a semi-active or active suspension — the suspension is reacting to signals from an electronic controller.

For example, a hydropneumatic Citroën will &quot;know&quot; how far off the ground the car is supposed to be, and constantly resets to achieve that level, regardless of load. However, this type of suspension will &quot;not&quot; instantly compensate for body roll due to cornering. Citroën&#x27;s system adds about 1% to the cost of the car versus passive steel springs.

Semi-active suspensions include devices, such as air springs and switchable shock absorbers, various self-levelling solutions, as well as systems, like hydropneumatic, hydrolastic, and hydragas suspensions.

Toyota introduced switchable shock absorbers in the 1983 Soarer. Delphi currently sells shock absorbers filled with a magneto-rheological fluid, whose viscosity can be changed electromagnetically — thereby giving variable control without switching valves, which is faster and thus more effective.

Fully active suspension systems use electronic monitoring of vehicle conditions, coupled with the means to change the behavior of vehicle suspension in real time to directly control the motion of the car.

Lotus Cars developed several prototypes from 1982 onwards, and introduced them to Formula One, where they have been fairly effective, but have now been banned.

Nissan introduced low-bandwidth active suspension &quot;circa&quot; 1990 as an option that added an extra 20% to the price of luxury models. Citroën has also developed several active suspension models (see hydractive). A fully active system from Bose Corporation, announced in 2009, uses linear electric motors in place of hydraulic or pneumatic actuators that have generally been used up until recently. Mercedes introduced an active suspension system called Active Body Control in its top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz CL-Class in 1999.

Several electromagnetic suspensions have also been developed for vehicles. Examples include the electromagnetic suspension of Bose, and the electromagnetic suspension developed by prof. Laurentiu Encica. In addition, the new Michelin wheel with embedded suspension functioning on an electric motor is also similar.

With the help of a control system, various semi-active/active suspensions realize an improved design compromise among different vibration modes of the vehicle; namely: bounce, roll, pitch and warp modes. However, the applications of these advanced suspensions are constrained by cost, packaging, weight, reliability, and/or other challenges.

===Interconnected suspensions===
Interconnected suspension, unlike semi-active/active suspensions, could easily decouple different vehicle vibration modes in a passive manner. Interconnections can be realized by various means, such as mechanical, hydraulic, and pneumatic. Anti-roll bars are one of the typical examples of mechanical interconnections, while it has been stated, that fluidic interconnections offer greater potential and flexibility in improving both the stiffness and damping properties.

Considering the considerable commercial potentials of hydro-pneumatic technology (Corolla, 1996), interconnected hydropneumatic suspensions have also been explored in some recent studies, and their potential benefits in enhancing vehicle ride and handling have been demonstrated. The control system can also be used for further improving performance of interconnected suspensions. Apart from academic research, an Australian company Kinetic had some success with various passive or semi-active systems (WRC: three Championships; the Dakar Rally: two Championships; Lexus GX470 2004 as the 4×4 of the year with KDSS; the 2005 PACE award). These systems by Kinetic generally decouple at least two vehicle modes (roll, warp (articulation), pitch, and/or heave (bounce)) to simultaneously control each mode&#x27;s stiffness and damping by using interconnected shock absorbers, and other methods. In 1999, Kinetic was bought out by Tenneco. Later developments by the Catalan company Creuat have devised a simpler system design based on single-acting cylinders. After some projects on competition, Creuat is active in providing retrofit systems for some vehicle models.

Historically, the first mass-production car with front-to-rear mechanical interconnected suspension was the 1948 Citroën 2CV. Suspension in the 2CV was extremely soft — the longitudinal link was making pitch softer, instead of making roll stiffer. It relied on extreme anti-dive and anti-squat geometries to compensate for that. This resulted in a softer axle-crossing stiffness that anti-roll bars would have otherwise compromised. The leading arm / trailing arm swinging arm, fore-aft linked suspension system, together with in-board front brakes, had a much smaller unsprung weight than existing coil spring or leaf designs. The interconnection transmitted some of the force deflecting a front wheel up over a bump, to push the rear wheel down on the same side. When the rear wheel met that bump a moment later, it did the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. The 2CV had a design brief to be able to be driven at speed over a ploughed field, such as by a farmer transporting chicken eggs. It originally featured friction dampers and tuned mass dampers. Later models had tuned mass dampers at the front with telescopic dampers/shock absorbers front and rear.

British Motor Corporation was also an early adopter of interconnected suspension. A system dubbed &quot;Hydrolastic&quot; was introduced in 1962 on Morris 1100, and went on to be used on a variety of BMC models. &quot;Hydrolastic&quot; was developed by suspension engineer Alex Moulton, and used rubber cones as the springing medium (these were first used on the 1959 Mini) with suspension units on each side connected to each other by a fluid-filled pipe. The fluid transmitted the force of road bumps from one wheel to the other (on the same principle as Citroën 2CV&#x27;s mechanical system described above), and because each suspension unit contained valves to restrict the flow of fluid, also served as a shock absorber. Moulton went on to develop a replacement for &quot;Hydrolastic&quot; for BMC&#x27;s successor British Leyland. This system, manufactured under licence by Dunlop in Coventry, called &quot;Hydragas&quot;, worked with the same principle, but instead of rubber spring units, it used metal spheres divided internally by a rubber diaphragm. The top half contained pressurised gas, and the lower half the same fluid as used on the &quot;Hydrolastic&quot; system. The fluid transmitted suspension forces between the units on each side, whilst the gas acted as the springing medium through the diaphragm. This is the same principle as the Citroën hydropneumatic system, and provides similar ride quality, but is self-contained, and does not require an engine-driven pump to provide hydraulic pressure. The downside is, that &quot;Hydragas&quot; is, unlike the Citroën system, not height-adjustable, or self-levelling. &quot;Hydragas&quot; was introduced in 1973 on Austin Allegro, and was used on several models; the last car to use it being MG F in 2002. The system was changed in favour of coil springs over dampers due to cost reasons towards the end of the vehicle&#x27;s life. When it was decommissioned in 2006, the &quot;Hydragas&quot; manufacturing line was over 40 years old.

Some of the last post-war Packard models also featured interconnected suspension.

==Types==
Suspension systems can be broadly classified into two subgroups: dependent and independent. These terms refer to the ability of opposite wheels to move independently of each other.
A &quot;dependent suspension&quot; normally has a beam (a simple &#x27;cart&#x27; axle) or a (driven) live axle that holds wheels parallel to each other and perpendicular to the axle. When the camber of one wheel changes, the camber of the opposite wheel changes in the same way (by convention, on one side, this is a positive change in the camber, and on the other side, this a negative change). De Dion suspensions are also in this category, as they rigidly connect the wheels together.

&quot;Independent suspension&quot; allows wheels to rise and fall on their own without affecting the opposite wheel. Suspensions with other devices, such as sway bars that link the wheels in some way, are still classed as independent.

&quot;Semi-dependent&quot; suspension is a third type. In this case, the motion of one wheel does affect the position of the other, but they are not rigidly attached to each other. Twist-beam rear suspension is such a system.

===Dependent suspensions===
Dependent systems may be differentiated by the system of linkages used to locate them, both longitudinally and transversely. Often, both functions are combined in a set of linkages.

Examples of location linkages include:
* Satchell link
* Panhard rod
* Watt&#x27;s linkage
* WOBLink
* Mumford linkage
* Leaf springs used for location (transverse or longitudinal)
** Fully elliptical springs usually need supplementary location links, and are no longer in common use
** Longitudinal semi-elliptical springs used to be common, and are still used in heavy-duty trucks and aircraft. They have the advantage, that the spring rate can easily be made progressive (non-linear).
** A single transverse leaf spring for both front wheels and/or both back wheels, supporting solid axles, was used by Ford Motor Company, before and soon after World War II, even on expensive models. It had the advantages of simplicity and low unsprung weight (compared to other solid-axle designs).

In a front-engine rear-drive vehicle, dependent rear suspension is either &quot;live-axle&quot; or deDion axle, depending on whether or not differential is carried on the axle. Live-axle is simpler, but unsprung weight contributes to wheel bounce.

Because it assures constant camber, dependent (and semi-independent) suspension is most common on vehicles that need to carry large loads as a proportion of the vehicle&#x27;s weight, that have relatively soft springs and that do not (for cost and simplicity reasons) use active suspensions. The use of dependent front suspension has become limited to heavier commercial vehicles.

===Independent suspensions===

The variety of independent systems is greater, and includes:
* Swing axle
* Sliding pillar
* MacPherson strut/Chapman strut
* Upper and lower A-arm (double wishbone)
* Multi-link suspension
* Semi-trailing arm suspension
* Swinging arm
** Transverse leaf springs when used as a suspension link, or four-quarter elliptics on one end of a car are similar to wishbones in geometry, but are more compliant. Examples are the front of the original Fiat 500, then Panhard Dyna Z, and the early examples of Peugeot 403, and the backs of AC Ace and AC Aceca.

Because the wheels are not constrained to remain perpendicular to a flat road surface in turning, braking, and varying load conditions, control of the wheel camber is an important issue. Swinging-arm was common in small cars that were sprung softly, and could carry large loads, because the camber is independent of load. Some active and semi-active suspensions maintain ride height, and therefore the camber, independent of load. In sports cars, optimal camber change when turning, is more important.

Wishbone and multi-link allow the engineer more control over the geometry, to arrive at the best compromise, than swing axle, MacPherson strut, or swinging arm do; however, the cost and space requirements may be greater.

Semi-trailing arm is in between, being a variable compromise between the geometries of swinging arm and swing axle.

=== Semi-independent suspension ===
In semi-independent suspensions, the wheels of an axle are able to move relative to one another, as in an independent suspension, but the position of one wheel has an effect on the position and attitude of the other wheel. This effect is achieved through the twisting or deflecting of suspension parts under load.

The most common type of semi-independent suspension is the twist beam.

==Other instances==
=== Tilting Suspension System ===
The Tilting Suspension System (also known as the Leaning Suspension System) is not a different type or geometry of construction; moreover, it is a technology addition to the conventional suspension system.

This kind of suspension system mainly consists of independent suspension (e.g., MacPherson strut, A-arm (double wishbone)). With the addition of these suspension systems, there is a further tilting or leaning mechanism that connects the suspension system with the vehicle body (chassis).

The tilting suspension system improves stability, traction, the turning radius of a vehicle, and the comfort of riders as well. While turning right or left, passengers or objects on a vehicle feel the G-force or inertial force outward the radius of the curvature, which is why two-wheeler riders (motorbikes) lean towards the center of curvature while turning, which improves stability and decreases the chances of toppling. But vehicles with more than two wheels, and equipped with a conventional suspension system, could not do the same until now, so the passengers feel the outward inertial force, which reduces the stability of riders and their comfort as well. This kind of tilting suspension system is the solution to the problem. If the road does not have super-elevation or banking, it will not affect the comfort with this suspension system, the vehicle tilt and decrease in the height of the center of gravity with an increase in stability. This suspension is also used in fun vehicles.

Some trains also use tilting suspension (Tilting Train) which increases the speed at cornering.

=== Rocker bogie mechanism ===
The rocker-bogie system is a suspension arrangement, in which there are some trailing arms fitted with some idler wheels. Due to articulation between the driving section and the followers, this suspension is very flexible. This kind of suspension is appropriate for extremely rough terrain.

This kind of suspension was used in the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover.

===Tracked vehicles===
Some vehicles, such as trains, run on long rail tracks fixed to the ground; and some, such as tractors, snow vehicles, and tanks run on continuous tracks that are part of the vehicle. Although either sort helps to smooth the path and reduce ground pressure, many of the same considerations apply.

===Armoured fighting vehicle suspension===
Military armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs), including tanks, have specialized suspension requirements. They can weigh more than seventy tons, and are required to move as quickly as possible over very rough or soft ground. Their suspension components must be protected from land mines and antitank weapons. Tracked AFVs can have as many as nine road wheels on each side. Many wheeled AFVs have six or eight large wheels. Some have a Central Tire Inflation System to reduce ground loading on poor surfaces. Some wheels are too big and too confined to turn, so skid steering is used with some wheeled, as well as with tracked vehicles.

The earliest tanks of World War I had fixed suspension with no designed movement whatsoever. This unsatisfactory situation was improved with leaf spring or coil spring suspensions adopted from agricultural, automotive, or railway machinery, but even these had very limited travel.

Speeds increased due to more powerful engines, and the quality of ride had to be improved. In the 1930s, the Christie suspension was developed, which allowed the use of coil springs inside a vehicle&#x27;s armored hull, by changing the direction of force deforming the spring, using a bell crank. The T-34&#x27;s suspension was directly descended from Christie designs.

Horstmann suspension was a variation which used a combination of bell crank and exterior coil springs, in use from the 1930s to the 1990s. The bogie, but nonetheless independent, suspensions of M3 Lee/Grant and M4 Sherman vehicles was similar to the Hortsmann type, with suspension sequestered within the track oval.

By World War II, the other common type was torsion bar suspension, getting spring force from twisting bars inside the hull — this sometimes had less travel than the Christie type, but was significantly more compact, allowing more space inside the hull, with the consequent possibility to install larger turret rings, and thus, heavier main armament. Torsion-bar suspension, sometimes including shock absorbers, has been the dominant heavy armored vehicle suspension since World War II. Torsion bars may take space under or near the floor, which may interfere with making the tank low to reduce exposure.

As with cars, wheel travel and spring rate affect the bumpiness of ride, and the speed at which rough terrain can be negotiated. It may be significant, that a smooth ride, which is often associated with comfort, increases the accuracy when firing on the move. It also reduces shock on optics and other equipment. The unsprung weight and track link weight may limit speed on roads, and can affect the useful lifetime of the vehicle&#x27;s track, and its other components.

Most German WWII half-tracks and their tanks introduced during the war, such as the Panther tank, had overlapping and sometimes interleaved road wheels to distribute the load more evenly on the tank&#x27;s track, and therefore on the ground. This apparently made a significant contribution to speed, range and track life, as well as providing a continuous band of protection. It has not been used since the end of that war, probably due to the maintenance requirements of more complicated mechanical parts working in mud, sand, rocks, snow, and ice; as well as due to cost. Rocks and frozen mud often got stuck between the overlapping wheels, which could prevent them from turning, or would cause damage to the road wheels. If one of the interior road wheels were damaged, it would require other road wheels to be removed in order to access the damaged road wheel, making the process more complicated and time-consuming.

<text>The Citroën Visa is a five-door, front-engine, front wheel drive supermini manufactured and marketed by Citroën from 1978 to 1988 in gasoline and diesel variants. 1,254,390 examples were ultimately manufactured over a single generation, with a single facelift (1981). China has also assembled the car as the Liuzhou Wuling LZW 7100 minicar. Production started in 1991 and finished in 1994.

Citroën commissioned Heuliez to produce a Visa convertible variant, marketed as the &quot;Décapotable&quot; (1984), and a box van variant (1985–2005) was marketed as the Citroën C15. A sedan variant was prototyped but never manufactured.

==Development==


In 1965 Robert Opron began working on the Citroën G-mini prototype and project EN101, a replacement for the 2CV using its flat twin engine and intended to launch in 1970. The advanced space efficient designs with compact exterior dimensions and an aerodynamic drag co-efficient Cd of 0.32, were never fully developed because of negative feedback from potential clients.

A subsequent program, the Citroën Prototype Y, was developed in the early 1970s in co-operation with Fiat, to replace the 2CV-based Citroën Ami — using lessons from the Citroën G-mini and EN101 projects. Prototype Y used the Fiat 127 platform with the pioneering transverse front-engine, front wheel drive layout Fiat had test-marketed in the Autobianchi Primula.

When cooperation with Fiat ended, Citroën designed its own platform, and subsequent to the takeover of Citroën by Peugeot in the wake of the 1974 oil crisis, the renamed &quot;Projet VD (Voiture Diminuée)&quot; became the Citroën Visa, incorporating the floor pan of the Peugeot 104 and using the 104 engine, transmission (under the engine) and chassis. The Visa thus became the first model under PSA Peugeot Citroën&#x27;s platform-sharing policy.

In 1984, the original Citroën platform design from &quot;Project Y&quot; emerged as the Romanian Oltcit Club, using a Citroën Visa flat-twin engine and Citroën GS-based gearbox or the GS flat-four engine and gearbox. This was also marketed in Western Europe as the flat-four (only) Citroën Axel to recoup Citroën&#x27;s Romanian investment, which the Romanian government could not repay. The resulting vehicle exhibited build quality issues, with 60,184 cars ultimately manufactured.

==Model history and design==
From its launch in September 1978, the front-wheel drive Visa was available in &quot;Spécial&quot; and &quot;Club&quot; models with a mapped electronic ignition (652 cc, 2-cylinder), and a &quot;Super E&quot; model (the 11RE after 1984), with the advanced Peugeot 1124  cc Douvrin engine / PSA X engine, a four-cylinder &quot;Suitcase engine&quot; — all aluminium alloy, chain driven overhead cam, with gearbox in the sump, sharing engine oil, mounted almost on its side. The 1124 cc was as economical as the Citroën 2CV-derived twin, but with much better performance. The flat-twin engine was mounted longitudinally; the four-cylinder engines were installed transversally. Later on it had 1219 cc (Super X) and then 954 cc (10E after 1984) and 1360 cc (1983 Visa GT and 14TRS after 1985) versions of the same engine. The original Visa&#x27;s engines, while of Peugeot origins, were modified by Citroën&#x27;s engineers with the aim of increasing fuel economy and responsiveness. The results were very limited and by the time of the introduction of the 1.4-liter models the engines were taken over wholesale from Peugeot without modifications.

The Visa featured a soft but well-damped, long-travel, fully independent suspension (Coil-sprung MacPherson struts at the front, with coil sprung trailing arms at the rear) that contributed to a soft ride similar to the Citroën 2CV, but with less extreme body roll. New for 1983 was the Visa Super E GL, which offered more complete equipment and a redesigned, more comfortable two-piece rear seat. The two seats were easily removed (without requiring tools) to increase luggage capability. For model year 1983 the most powerful Visa yet, the Visa GT, arrived. In addition to the 80-PS engine, it offered alloy wheels with Michelin TRX tires, spoilers, sideskirts and trim, special colors, and a more sporting suspension tuning than what was normal for Citroën. In early 1985 the limited production Visa 14 S Tonic arrived, a version using the GT&#x27;s engine and transmission coupled with an all-white appearance similar to the Visa Crono but at a price not much higher than the basic Visa 11 RE. Only 2000 Tonics were made.

In spring 1984 the diesel version was added. The Visa 17D and 17RD used the famously rugged and refined, class-leading 1769 cc XUD diesel and transmission from the Peugeot 205. The powertrain required too wide a track for the original engine compartment and wings, so the front wings were extended with large black plastic wheel arch panels. The spare wheel that in smaller petrol engine versions was mounted on top of the flat or near horizontal engine, was bolted to the otherwise flat boot floor, compromising luggage space. In continental Europe, a basic diesel van the &#x27;Visa Enterprise&#x27; was sold that used the normal Visa bodyshell with the rear doors welded shut. This version mounted a space saver spare wheel under the bonnet, atop the diesel engine.

At the Paris Salon 1984, for model year 1985, the 1.4 L TRS was presented. The Visa 14 TRS, was produced for two years (1985–1987), shared its engine with the Citroën BX14 and receiving a favourable review by &quot;CAR magazine&quot;. In early 1985 the Visa GTI, fitted with a 1580 cc engine, was introduced. This would be the fastest Visa offered with a top speed of 188 or 192 km/h depending on the engine version.

Between 1985 and 1987 the 1.1 litre petrol and 1.7 litre diesel &quot;Leader&quot; special editions were marketed. Near the end of its production life, a catalyzed version of the 1360 cc engine was added for markets with stricter emissions standards.

No automatic gearbox version was produced.

Production of the Visa finished near the end of 1988, when the five-door version of the Citroën AX was launched.

===Dashboard satellites and interior===
The Visa driver controls were located in two pods flanking the steering wheel and were marketed as &quot;PRN Lunule (Satellites)&quot; (P=Pluie – Rain, R=Route – Road, N=Nuit – Night). Controls for wipers, washers, horn, indicators, headlamps and flashers were mounted ergonomically on a cylindrical unit with heating and ventilation controls using laterally arcing sliders were located oppositely on a flat control pod — all within finger-tip reach. In 1979 Popular Science described the system as using a &quot;finger-tip control drum.&quot;

In March 1981 the Visa received a facelift, designed by Heuliez, retaining the original interior and the &quot;PRN Satellite&quot; controls. It was now referred to as the Visa II. In the summer of 1984 (for the 1985 model year) the Visa was updated again and received a new dashboard, instruments, and switchgear, retaining its monospoke steering wheel. The turn signals were now self-cancelling, making this the first Citroën to be equipped with this near-universal feature.

The curved sides of the Visa&#x27;s windscreen enabled the use of a very large single wiper on the long narrow windscreen. The front of the revised car was designed to aerodynamically reduce the deposition of dirt on the headlights, and to reduce the risk of stone chips to the headlights, bonnet and windscreen.

The Visa&#x27;s heating and ventilation system, (even though it used only a water control valve for temperature control and not air mixing), could provide cold air from fascia side vents to the face while warming the car. The central directable fascia vents could be heated and angled, so that they could be pointed directly at the windscreen in front of the driver, to keep it clear in extreme misting conditions. There was also an additional mid level vent, to blow air between the front seats to the back of the car.

The Visa&#x27;s rear parcel shelf was in two hinged sections, one in the car, the other on the tailgate, to allow objects that were slightly too tall to still fit without removing the shelf. When carrying larger loads, the part of the shelf attached to the tailgate could be folded up, and fixed with the elasticated support strings, to protect the rear window and heated rear screen elements.

===Visa Décapotable===
Citroën commissioned a four-door convertible Visa from Heuliez in 1984. Marketed as the Visa Décapotable, this was one of very few cabrio coaches built in the period: the bodywork features a hybrid fixed-profile convertible with the doors and window frames remaining intact. Based on the 11RE the convertible was heavier and slower than its hatchback counterpart and cost about 50 percent more; the markup was similar to what Fiat and Ford charged for their full convertible versions of the Ritmo and Escort.

== Engines ==

== Variants==

The first mass-produced sport variant of the Visa was the GT in 1982. It was powered by the 1360 cc XY engine with two downdraft Weber single-barrel carburetors and produced. A lower power single-carb engine was produced for Switzerland. In 1985 a limited production &#x27;GT Tonic&#x27; version was released with the addition of a sportier body kit incorporating the riveted wheel arches from the &#x27;Chrono&#x27; motorsport model. 

Built in late 1981 the Visa Trophée was produced in limited numbers for homologation in the rally group B category. It used the 1219 cc XZ engine as used in the Visa Super X but with heavily modified cylinder head, breathing through two side-draft Weber 40 DCOE carburetors and producing an impressive . The Trophée was designed specifically for the entry level rally car market such as privateers and dealership teams. It had weight savings over the GT such as lighter weight fibre glass body panels, re-designed dashboard and lexan side windows allowing it to weigh in at just under 700 kg. Rally versions were sometimes increased in capacity up to 1299 cc and could produce up to .

The Visa Chrono was released in 1982 intended for competition in the same vein as the Trophée but in the larger capacity group B engine class. It used the same 1360 cc XY engine as the GT but with a modified, larger valve head and two double-barrel side draft Solex C35 carburetors and produced . Aside from the exterior body decals other modifications to the car such as the bodykit, with Cibie fog lights, and dashboard also differentiated it from the GT. 2160 were produced for the French market and a further 1600 produced for continental Europe outside France. The non-French models did not have the Solex carbs but the GT&#x27;s Weber carb and head set up and produced . 
The Visa &quot;Mille Pistes&quot; was a four wheel drive version of the Visa homologated for the group B B/10 class. The production versions were known as the Visa 1000 Pistes 4 x 4 of which 200 were built for homologation in 1984. The production version was essentially a 4WD Chrono with the same 1360 cc engine but on twin Weber 40 DCOE carbs and producing . The Mille Pistes received its name after a Visa 4 x 4 competing in the experimental category won this rally in 1983, with Wambergue and Laverne driving. The Evolution models were modified by Denis Mathiot; the displacement was increased to 1440 cc and the resulting power ranged from , with the weight down to .

At the Paris Salon 1984, for model year 1985, the high-performance 1.6 GTi was presented. The GTi used the 1.6 L fuel injected XU5J engine and transmission combination in versions, borrowed from the successful Peugeot 205 GTI. The car used plastic wheel arch extensions to hide a wider track that was needed to accommodate the larger engine, something that also had to be done for the diesel model. It received good reviews about its ride, performance and roadholding, but due to its older, failed facelift looks, and its five doors it was not a big seller, even with a much lower price than the chic 205.

<doc id="426976" wikidata="Q184184" url="?curid=426976" title="Nouadhibou">
<text>Nouadhibou (; , ;formerly in French: ) is the second largest city in Mauritania and serves as a major commercial center. The city has about 173,000 inhabitants. It is situated on a 65-kilometre peninsula or headland called Ras Nouadhibou, &#x27;, or&#x27;, of which the western side has the city of La Güera. Nouadhibou is consequently located merely a couple of kilometers from the border between Mauritania and Western Sahara. Its current mayor is Elghassem Ould Bellali, who was installed on 15 October 2018.

Nouadhibou is a major hotspot for migrant smuggling, serving as a key departure point for those attempting to reach Europe.

== Overview ==

The city consists of four major areas: the city center, including the international airport; Numerowatt to the north; Cansado, the main residential area, to the south; and a dormitory town for the workers of the harbor facilities which are located a few kilometers south of the city, near the tip of the Ras Nouadhibou peninsula, at Port Minéralier. 


Attractions in Nouadhibou include the Table Remarquable, several markets, a ships&#x27; graveyard and Mediterranean monk seals. 

The port of Nouadhibou is the final resting place of over 300 scuttled ships, forming the world’s largest ship graveyard. Unlike the arrival &quot;en masse&quot; of ships at Mallows Bay, here the number of craft has built up over time, as corrupt officials accepted bribes from boat owners to allow them to dump their vessels in the area. 

Nouadhibou has long been an important transit point for international transport. In the beginning of the 20th century, it was a stopover for the Latécoère air-transport network for mail and passengers for western Africa and overseas colonies like Martinique. Antoine de Saint-Exupery spent much time there as a pilot and as writer. 

Near the harbor is the terminus of Mauritania&#x27;s only railway line, which mainly brings iron ore from the mining areas near Fdérik and Zouérat, which are located up to inland. 

Processing iron ore forms the largest industry in Nouadhibou, although the overall major economic activity is fishing.

==History==
The town was established as a small fishing port, controlled by the Portuguese, the Dutch and finally the French. 

In 1907 by decree of the governor-general of French West Africa Ernest Roume, it was renamed &quot;Port-Étienne&quot; after the former French Minister of the Colonies Eugène Étienne. After Mauritania became independent in 1960, the town name changed to Nouadhibou. 

On 30 June 1973, at the time of the second-longest solar eclipse in the 20th century, an Aerobee rocket was launched at Nouadhibou for solar research.

Since February 2006, Nouadhibou has emerged as a major departure point for African migrants aiming to reach the Canary Islands. This extremely dangerous route to reach the European Union gained popularity due to heightened emigration controls along Morocco&#x27;s coast and near the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in late 2005. As of 2024, the city remains a significant departure hub for irregular migrants to Europe, with over 80% of arrivals in the Canary Islands originating from Mauritania, many of whom are from Mali.

The city is reputedly also a center of trading of meteorites found in the Sahara. 

===Population history===
==Climate==
Nouadhibou features a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. The city sees virtually no rainfall during the course of the year averaging a paltry annually. Despite the fact that it features a hot desert climate, the area does not quite see the extreme temperatures that other areas with this climate feature because of strong maritime influences, which also causes a seasonal lag in the warmer months. The average annual temperature in the city is and the average annual high temperature is . 

==Transportation==

===Paved roads===
Nouadhibou is linked with the Coastal Motorway RN2 to the capital Nouakchott (a distance of ) and by highway to the Western Saharan border in the north (a distance of ). 

===Railway===
Nouadhibou also is connected by railway to the iron mines in Zouérat, 670 km to the east. The freight trains can be as long as 3 km, reputedly the longest in the world. The railway also carries passengers and calls at Choum. 

===Aviation===
The city is served by the Nouadhibou Airport. 
==Economy==
Plans were drawn up at the beginning of 1963 to build a port called Port Wharf in the fishing harbour, which included the construction of industrial and trade buildings. This became operational in 1966. This wharf was designed to accommodate traffic of up to 50,000 tonnes. 

In 1977, the wharf was lengthened to provide 3 extra berths for ships of average tonnage raising its capacity to 320,000 tonnes. 

==Health==
The Nouadhibou Regional Hospital was opened in 2017 after a build time of five years and is the largest hospital in the region. 

==Sports==
Two football clubs based in Nouadhibou participate in the Mauritanian Premier League as of the 2018–19 season: FC Nouadhibou and ASC Snim.

<text>Zinder (locally, &quot;Damagaram&quot;), formerly also spelled Sinder, is the third largest city in Niger, with a population of 235,605 as by the 2012 census. It is situated east of the capital Niamey and north of the Nigerian city of Kano.

==History==

===Early history===
Zinder was originally the site of the small Hausa village of Zengou. The town grew dramatically in importance following the arrival of Kanuri aristocrats in 1736, who built a new fortified quarter called Birni to the south and declared the town of Zinder as the capital of the Sultanate of Damagaram in 1736. Thereafter Zinder became an important centre of the Trans-Saharan trade and a major hub for trade south through Kano and east to Bornu. The sultanate remained nominally subject to the Borno Empire until the reign of Sultan Tanimoune Dan Souleymane in the mid-to-late 19th century, who declared independence and initiated a phase of vigorous expansion.

Europeans began exploring the region in the 19th century, beginning with German explorer Heinrich Barth, who stayed in Zinder in 1851, and later the French explorer Marius Gabriel Cazemajou, who was killed in the city in 1897. It was then, after a brief resistance, occupied in July 1899 by Lt. Pallier of the Voulet-Chanoine mission. The French barracks was called Fort Cazemajou and it served as the capital of the Niger Military Territory upon its creation in 1911. In 1926, following fears of Hausa revolts and improving relations with the Djerma of the west, the capital was transferred back to the village of Niamey.

Upon Niger&#x27;s independence from France, the town&#x27;s fort was renamed for Sultane Tanimoune.

===Recent history===
In 2003, telecommunications company Celtel arrived in Zinder, building a mobile phone tower and selling prepaid phone cards to residents. This arrival of the mobile phone drastically changed the predominant modes of communication in the city, allowing traders to have a faster and more affordable means of communicating with buyers and sellers. This is an example of how cellular towers in the developing world have begun to transform the market.

In September 2024, the Zinder Mosque, one of Niger&#x27;s oldest mosques and a significant cultural and religious site in the city, collapsed due to intense rainfall.

==Geography==
The centre of Zinder consists of three main areas: in the north is &quot;Zengou or Zango&quot;, the old Tuareg suburb, is known for its vernacular architecture, and in the south lies &quot;Birni&quot;, the old Hausa town, which is home to Zinder Great Mosque, Fort Tanimoune and the Sultan&#x27;s Palace, as well as a museum. &quot;Sabon Gari&quot; (the new town), lies between Birni and Zengou, and is the commercial centre, known for its large market (the &quot;Grand Marché&quot;). The city now sprawls to the north and west, extending to the Karkada section, in the north; other neighbourhoods include Garin Mallam and Gawon Kollia.

The city has many distinctive granite rocks which can result in standing water during the rainy season, though the city has a long history of water shortages. Recently water was piped by a Chinese-owned company from the north to provide water to most of the city, however, this problem is likely to continue due to expected population growth. 

The city is divided into 5 urban municipalities: Zinder I, Zinder II, Zinder III, Zinder IV and Zinder V.

== Demographics ==

The population of Zinder City has quadrupled from around 50,000 inhabitants in 1977 to over 200,000 people in 2012.

==Transport==
Zinder Airport (code: ZND) is located a few kilometres southwest of the town.

==Economy==
The economy of the city is still largely based on the agricultural activities of the surroundings. Today, the city counts four officially recognised industries: Tannerie Malam Yaro (leather tanning), Gidan Alkaki (cake production), Sahara Sahel Foods (processing of non-wood forest produce) and SORAZ (petrol refinery located 50km North of the city). The latter is Niger Republic&#x27;s first oil refinery, and was commissioned in November 2011.

== Climatic ==
The temperature rarely drops below 54°F or rises above 108°F. The climate is dry, with short summers and pleasant winters.

<doc id="426982" wikidata="Q369730" url="?curid=426982" title="Pedestrian zone">
<text>Pedestrian zones (also known as auto-free zones and car-free zones, as pedestrian precincts in British English, and as pedestrian malls in the United States and Australia) are areas of a city or town restricted to use by people on foot or human-powered transport such as bicycles, with non-emergency motor traffic not allowed. Converting a street or an area to pedestrian-only use is called &quot;pedestrianisation&quot;.

Pedestrianisation usually aims to provide better accessibility and mobility for pedestrians, to enhance the amount of shopping and other business activities in the area or to improve the attractiveness of the local environment in terms of aesthetics, air pollution, noise and crashes involving motor vehicle with pedestrians. In some cases, motor traffic in surrounding areas increases, as it is displaced rather than replaced. Nonetheless, pedestrianisation schemes are often associated with significant falls in local air and noise pollution and in accidents, and frequently with increased retail turnover and increased property values locally.

A &quot;car-free&quot; development generally implies a large-scale pedestrianised area that relies on modes of transport other than the car, while pedestrian zones may vary in size from a single square to entire districts, but with highly variable degrees of dependence on cars for their broader transport links.

Pedestrian zones have a great variety of approaches to human-powered vehicles such as bicycles, inline skates, skateboards and kick scooters. Some have a total ban on anything with wheels, others ban certain categories, others segregate the human-powered wheels from foot traffic, and others still have no rules at all. Many Middle Eastern kasbahs have no motorized traffic, but use donkey- or hand-carts to carry goods.
==History==

===Origins in arcades===

The idea of separating pedestrians from wheeled traffic is an old one, dating back at least to the Renaissance. However, the earliest modern implementation of the idea in cities seems to date from about 1800, when the first covered shopping arcade was opened in Paris. Separated shopping arcades were constructed throughout Europe in the 19th century, precursors of modern shopping malls. A number of architects and city planners, including Joseph Paxton, Ebenezer Howard, and Clarence Stein, in the 19th and early 20th centuries proposed plans to separate pedestrians from traffic in various new developments.

===1920s–1970s===
The first &quot;pedestrianisation&quot; of an existing street seems to have taken place &quot;around 1929&quot; in Essen, Germany. This was in Limbecker Straße, a very narrow shopping street that could not accommodate both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Two other German cities followed this model in the early 1930s, but the idea was not seen outside Germany. Following the devastation of the Second World War a number of European cities implemented plans to pedestrianise city streets, although usually on a largely ad hoc basis, through the early 1950s, with little landscaping or planning. By 1955 twenty-one German cities had closed at least one street to automobile traffic, although only four were &quot;true&quot; pedestrian streets, designed for the purpose. At this time pedestrianisation was not seen as a traffic restraint policy, but rather as a complement to customers who would arrive by car in a city centre.

Pedestrianisation was also common in the United States during the 1950s and 60s as downtown businesses attempted to compete with new suburban shopping malls. However, most of these initiatives were not successful in the long term, and about 90% have been changed back to motorised areas.

===1980s–2010s===

In the United States, several pedestrian zones in major tourist areas were successful, such as the renovation of the mall in Santa Monica on Los Angeles&#x27; Westside and its relaunch as the Third Street Promenade; the creation of the covered, pedestrian Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas; the revival of East 4th Street in Downtown Cleveland; and the new pedestrian zone created in the mid-2010s in New York City including along Broadway (the street) and around Times Square.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, some cities had made the pedestrianization of additional streets to encourage social distancing and in many cases to provide extra rooms for restaurants to serve food on patios extended into the newly available spaces. In the United States, New York City closed up to of streets to cars across the city. In Madrid, Spain, the city pedestrianized of streets and of spaces in total. The COVID-19 pandemic gave also birth to proposals for radical change in the organisation of the city, in particular Barcelona, being the pedestrianisation of the whole city and the proposal of an inversion of the concept of &quot;sidewalk&quot; two elements of the Manifesto for the Reorganisation of the city, written by architecture and urban theorist Massimo Paolini and signed by 160 academics and 300 architects. 

==Definitions and types==

A pedestrian zone is often limited in scope: for example, a single square or a few streets reserved for pedestrians, within a city where residents still largely get around in cars. A car-free town, city or region may be much larger.

===Car free towns, cities and regions===
A car-free zone is different from a typical pedestrian zone, in that it implies a development largely predicated on modes of transport other than the car.

====Examples====

A number of towns and cities in Europe have never allowed motor vehicles. Archetypal examples are:

* Venice, which occupies many islands in a lagoon, divided by and accessed from canals. Motor traffic stops at the car park at the head of the viaduct from the mainland, and water transport and walking take over from there. However, motor vehicles are allowed on the nearby Lido.
* Zermatt in the Swiss Alps. Most visitors reach Zermatt by a cog railway, and there are pedestrian-only streets, but there are also roads with motor vehicles.

Other examples are:

* Cinque Terre in Italy
* Ghent in Belgium: the pedestrian zone was extended in 2017 from 35 to more than 50 hectares (123 acres), one of the largest car-free areas in Europe.
* Pontevedra in Spain, an international model of pedestrianization, almost 50% of the city is pedestrianised.;
* The Old Town of Rhodes, where many, if not most, of the streets are too steep and/or narrow for car traffic.
* Mount Athos, an autonomous monastic state under the sovereignty of Greece, does not permit automobiles on its territory. Trucks and work-related vehicles only are in use there.
* The medieval city of Mdina in Malta does not allow automobiles past the city walls. It is known as the &quot;Silent City&quot; because of the absence of motor traffic in the city.
* Sark, an island in the English Channel, is a car-free zone where only bicycles, carriages and tractors are used as transportation.
* Gulangyu, an island off the coast of Xiamen in southeastern China. The only vehicles permitted are small electric buggies and electric government service vehicles.

To assist with transport from the car parks in at the edge of car-free cities, there are often bus stations, bicycle sharing stations, and the like.

====Car-free development====
The term car-free &quot;development&quot; implies a physical change: either build-up or changes to an existing built area.

Melia &quot;et al.&quot; (2010) define car-free developments as &quot;residential or mixed use developments which:
* Normally provide a traffic-free immediate environment, and
* Offer no parking or limited parking separated from the residence, and:
* Are designed to enable residents to live without owning a car.&quot;

This definition (which they distinguish from the more common &quot;low car development&quot;) is based mainly on experience in North West Europe, where the movement for car-free development began. Within this definition, three types are identified:

* Vauban model, based on Vauban, Freiburg: it is not &quot;carfree&quot;, but &quot;parking-space-free&quot; () in some streets.
* Limited Access model
* Pedestrianised centres with residential population

===Limited access type===
The more common form of carfree development involves some sort of physical barrier, which prevents motor vehicles from penetrating into a car-free interior. Melia &quot;et al.&quot; describe this as the &quot;limited access&quot; type. In some cases, such as Stellwerk 60 in Cologne, there is a removable barrier, controlled by a residents&#x27; organisation. In Amsterdam, Waterwijk is a 6-hectare neighborhood where cars may only access parking areas from the streets that form the edges of the neighborhood; all of the inner areas of the neighborhood are car-free.
===Temporary car-free streets===

Many cities close certain streets to automobiles, typically on weekends and especially in warm weather, to provide more urban space for recreation, and to increase foot traffic to nearby businesses. Examples include Newbury Street in Boston, and Memorial Drive in Cambridge, Massachusetts (which is along a river). In some cases, popularity has resulted in streets being permanently closed to cars, including JFK Drive in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco; Griffith Drive in Griffith Park, Los Angeles; and Capel Street in Dublin.

==Reception==
===Benefits===
Several studies have been carried out on European carfree developments. The most comprehensive was conducted in 2000 by Jan Scheurer. Other more recent studies have been made of specific car-free areas such as Vienna&#x27;s Floridsdorf car-free development.

Characteristics of car-free developments:
* Very low levels of car use, resulting in much less traffic on surrounding roads
* High rates of walking and cycling
* More independent movement and active play for children
* Less land is used for parking and roads, so more available for green or social space

The main benefits found for car-free developments:
*Low atmospheric emissions
*Low road accident rates
*Better built environment conditions
*Encouragement of active modes.

The main problems related to parking management. Where parking is not controlled in the surrounding area, this often results in complaints from neighbours about overspill parking.

===Problems and criticism===
There were calls for traffic to be reinstated in Trafalgar Square, London, after pedestrianization caused noise nuisance for visitors to the National Gallery. The director of the gallery is reported to have blamed pedestrianization for the &quot;trashing of a civic space&quot;.

Local shopkeepers may be critical of the effect of pedestrianization on their businesses. Reduced through traffic can lead to fewer customers using local businesses, depending on the environment and the area&#x27;s dependence on the through traffic.

==By region and country==
===Europe===


A large number of European towns and cities have made part of their centres car-free since the early 1960s. These are often accompanied by car parks on the edge of the pedestrianised zone, and, in the larger cases, park and ride schemes.

====Armenia====
Northern Avenue, located in the Kentron district of central Yerevan, is a large pedestrian avenue. The avenue was inaugurated in 2007 and is mainly home to residential buildings, offices, luxury shops and restaurants.

====Belgium====
In Belgium, Brussels implemented Europe&#x27;s largest pedestrian zone (French: &quot;Le Piétonnier&quot;), in phases starting in 2015 and will cover . The area covers much of the historic center within the Small Ring (the ring road built on the site of the 14th-century walls), including the Grand-Place/Grote Markt, the Place de Brouckère/De Brouckèreplein, the Boulevard Anspach/Anspachlaan, and the Place de la Bourse/Beursplein.

====Denmark====
Central Copenhagen is one of the oldest and largest: it was converted from car traffic into a pedestrian zone in 1962 as an experiment, and is centered on Strøget, which is not a single street but a series of interconnected avenues which create a very large pedestrian zone, although it is crossed in places by streets with vehicular traffic. Most of these zones allow delivery trucks to service the businesses there during the early morning, and street-cleaning vehicles will usually go through these streets after most shops have closed for the night. It has grown in size from in 1962 to in 1996.

====Germany====
A number of German islands ban or strictly limit the private use of motor vehicles. Heligoland, Hiddensee, and all but two of the East Frisian islands are car-free; Borkum and Norderney have car-free zones and strictly limit automobile use during the summer season and in certain areas, also forbidding travel at night. Some areas provide exceptions for police and emergency vehicles; Heligoland also bans bicycles.

In the early 1980s, the Alternative Liste für Demokratie und Umweltschutz (which later became part of Alliance 90/The Greens) unsuccessfully campaigned to make West Berlin a car-free zone.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, the inner city of Arnhem has a pedestrian zone () within the boundaries of the following streets and squares: Nieuwe Plein, Willemsplein, Gele Rijdersplein, Looierstraat, Velperbinnensingel, Koningsplein, St. Catharinaplaats, Beekstraat, Walburgstraat, Turfstraat, Kleine Oord, and Nieuwe Oeverstraat.

Rotterdam&#x27;s city center was almost completely destroyed by German bombing in May 1940. The city decided to build a central shopping street, for pedestrians only, the Lijnbaan, which became Europe&#x27;s first purpose-built pedestrian street. The Lijnbaan served as a model for many other such streets in the early post-World War II era, such as Warsaw, Prague, Hamburg, and the UK&#x27;s first pedestrianised shopping precinct in Stevenage in 1959. Rotterdam has since expanded the pedestrian zone to other streets. As of 2018, Rotterdam featured three different types of pedestrian zones: &quot;pedestrian zones&quot;, &quot;pedestrian zones, cycling permitted outside of shopping hours&quot;, and &quot;pedestrian zones, cycling permitted 24/7&quot;. Three exceptions to motor vehicles could apply to specific sections of these three zones, namely: &quot;logistics allowed within window times (5 to 10:30 a.m)&quot;, &quot;logistics allowed 24/7&quot;, and &quot;commercial traffic allowed during market days&quot;.

====United Kingdom====
In Britain, shopping streets primarily for pedestrians date back to the thirteenth century. A 1981 study found that many Victorian and later arcades continued to be used. A third of London&#x27;s 168 precincts at that time had been built before 1939, as were a tenth of the 1,304 precincts in the U.K. as a whole.

Early post-1945 new towns carried on the tradition of providing some traffic-free shopping streets. However, in the conversion of traditional shopping streets to pedestrian precincts, Britain started only in 1967 (versus Germany&#x27;s first conversion in 1929, or the first in the U.S. in 1959). Since then growth was rapid, such that by 1980 a study found that most British towns and cities had a pedestrian shopping precinct; 1,304 in total.

====Turkey====
In Istanbul, İstiklal Caddesi is a pedestrian street (except for a historic streetcar that runs along it) and a major tourist draw.

===U.S. and Canada===
====Canada====
Some Canadian examples are the Sparks Street Mall area of Ottawa, the Distillery District in Toronto, Scarth Street Mall in Regina, Stephen Avenue Mall in Calgary (with certain areas open to parking for permit holders) and part of Prince Arthur Street and the Gay Village in Montreal. Algonquin and Ward&#x27;s Islands, parts of the Toronto Islands group, are also car-free zones for all 700 residents. Since summer 2004, Toronto has also been experimenting with &quot;Pedestrian Sundays&quot; in its busy Kensington Market. Granville Mall in Halifax, Nova Scotia was a run-down section of buildings on Granville Street built in the 1840s that was restored in the late 1970s. The area was then closed off to vehicles.

====United States====
=====Downtown pedestrian zones=====
In the United States, these zones are commonly called pedestrian malls or pedestrian streets and today are relatively rare, with a few notable exceptions. In 1959, Kalamazoo was the first American city to implement a &quot;pedestrian mall&quot; in its downtown core. This became a method that some cities applied for their downtowns to compete with the growing suburban shopping malls of the time. In the 1960s and 70s, over 200 towns in the United States adopted this approach. 

The Downtown Mall in Charlottesville, VA is one of the longest pedestrian malls in the United States, created in 1976 and spanning nine city blocks.
A number of streets and malls in New York City are now pedestrian-only, including 6½ Avenue, Fulton Street, parts of Broadway, and a block of 25th Street.

A portion of Third Street in Santa Monica in Greater Los Angeles was converted into a pedestrian mall in the 1960s to become what is now the Third Street Promenade, a very popular shopping district located just a few blocks from the beach and Santa Monica Pier.

Lincoln Road in Miami Beach, which had previously been a shopping street with traffic, was converted into a pedestrian only street in 1960. The designer was Morris Lapidus. Lincoln Road Mall is now one of the main attractions in Miami Beach.

The idea of exclusive pedestrian zones lost popularity through the 1980s and into the 1990s and results were generally disappointing, but are enjoying a renaissance with the 1989 renovation and relaunch of the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, California, the 1994-5 Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas and recent pedestrianization of various streets in New York City. These pedestrian zones were more closely tied to the success of retail than in Europe, and by the 1980s, most did not succeed competing with ever more elaborate enclosed malls. Almost all of this generation of pedestrian malls built from 1959 through to the 1970s, have disappeared, or were shrunk down in the 1990s at the request of the retailers. Half of Kalamazoo&#x27;s pedestrian mall has been converted into a regular street with auto traffic, though with wide sidewalks.

=====Outside large cities=====
Mackinac Island, between the upper and lower peninsulas of Michigan, banned horseless carriages in 1896, making it auto-free. The original ban still stands, except for emergency vehicles. Travel on the island is largely by foot, bicycle, or horse-drawn carriage. An road, M-185 rings the island, and numerous roads cover the interior. M-185 is the only highway in the United States without motorized vehicles.
Fire Island in Suffolk County, New York is pedestrianised east of the Fire Island Lighthouse and west of Smith Point County Park (with the exception of emergency vehicles).

Paquetá Island in Rio de Janeiro is auto-free. The only cars allowed on the island are police and ambulance vehicles. In Rio de Janeiro, the roads beside the beaches are auto-free on Sundays and holidays.

Downtown Rio de Janeiro, Ouvidor Street, over almost its entire length, has been continually a pedestrian space since the mid-nineteenth century when not even carts or carriages were allowed. And the Saara District, also downtown, consists of some dozen or more blocks of colonial streets, off-limits to cars, and crowded with daytime shoppers. Likewise, many of the city&#x27;s hillside favelas are effectively pedestrian zones as the streets are too narrow and/or steep for automobiles.

Eixo Rodoviário, in Brasília, which is 13 kilometers long and 30 meters wide and is an arterial road connecting the center of that city from both southward and northward wings of Brasília, perpendicular to the well known Eixo Monumental (Monumental Axis in English), is auto-free on Sundays and holidays.

===Oceania===
====Australia====

In Australia, as in the US, these zones are commonly called pedestrian malls and in most cases comprise only one street. Most pedestrian streets were created in the late 1970s and 1980s, the first being City Walk, Garema Place in Canberra in 1971. Of 58 pedestrian streets created in Australia in the last quarter of the 20th century, 48 remain today, ten having re-introduced car access between 1990 and 2004. All capital cities in Australia have at least one pedestrian street of which most central are: George Street, Pitt Street Mall and Martin Place in Sydney, Bourke Street Mall in Melbourne, Queen Street Mall and Brunswick Street Mall in Brisbane, Rundle Mall in Adelaide, Hay Street and Murray Street Malls in Perth, Elizabeth Street Mall in Hobart, City Walk in Canberra, and Smith Street in Darwin. Many other mid-sized and regional Australian cities also feature pedestrian malls, examples include Rooke Street Devonport Langtree Avenue Mildura, Cavill Avenue Surfers Paradise, Bridge Street Ballarat, Nicholas Street Ipswich, Hargreaves Street Bendigo, Maude Street Shepparton and Little Mallop Street Geelong.
Empirical studies by Jan Gehl indicate an increase of pedestrian traffic as result of public domain improvements in the centres of Melbourne with 39% increase between 1994 and 2004 and Perth with 13% increase between 1993 and 2009.

Most intensive pedestrian traffic flows on a summer weekday have been recorded in Bourke Street Mall Melbourne with 81,000 pedestrians (2004), Rundle Mall Adelaide with 61,360 pedestrians (2002), Pitt Street Mall Sydney with 58,140 (2007) and Murray Street Mall Perth with 48,350 pedestrians (2009).

Rottnest Island off Perth is car-free, only allowing vehicles for essential services. Bicycles are the main form of transport on the island; they can be hired or brought over on the ferry.

In Melbourne&#x27;s north-eastern suburbs, there have been many proposals to make the Doncaster Hill development area a pedestrian zone. If the proposals are passed, the zone could be one of the largest in the world, by area.

====New Zealand====

Wellington&#x27;s Cuba Street became the first pedestrian-only street in New Zealand when in 1965 the Wellington tramway lines were removed and the street was closed off to auto traffic, and after public pressure to keep it closed to automobiles, part of the street was pedestrianised in 1969 and reopened as Cuba Mall.

New Zealand&#x27;s second-largest city, Christchurch, made its main shopping streets (Cashel &amp; High Street) pedestrian-only in 1982 and created City Mall, also commonly known as Cashel Mall. The concept was first proposed in 1965, around the same time Wellington proposed Cuba Street&#x27;s pedestrianisation. After the success of Cuba Mall in Wellington, Christchurch decided to continue with the plans. In 1976 the Bridge of Remembrance was pedestrianised, and eventually in August 1982 the entire City Mall was pedestrianised and fully opened to the public. The area was repaved in the late 2000s and again after the Christchurch Earthquakes in 2010 &amp; 2011.

Queenstown has made most of its town centre a pedestrian zone with the lower part of Ballarat Street converted in the 1970s and turned into Queenstown Mall. Most recently, Lower Beach Street has been partially pedestrianised with now only one-way traffic for cars.

Auckland&#x27;s Lower Queen Street was pedestrianised in 2020. 

Town Centre–style pedestrian malls rose in popularity in the 1970 &amp; 1980s, springing up around New Zealand after the success of Cuba Mall. Many, however, have since fallen into disrepair and abandonment and are now classified as Dead malls, including Bishopdale Village Mall, Otara Town Centre, and New Brighton Mall. Pedestrian malls are still being built, however much more scarcely and now are usually called Town Centres and have parking on the outskirts, including Rolleston Fields, The Sands Town Centre, and The Landing Wigram.

A proposal has been made for a pedestrian priority community near Papakura in Auckland. The community would be called Sunfield and cost $4 Billion NZD to build. It is designed to have 4,400 homes and is projected to decrease normal car usage by 90% compared to typical suburbs. It has run into challenges after the project being rejected by Kāinga Ora for fast-tracking following Covid-19; construction authorities took Kāinga Ora to court over the matter.

<text>Bobo-Dioulasso ( , ) is a city in Burkina Faso with a population of 1,129,000 (); it is the second-largest city in the country, after Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso&#x27;s capital. The name means &quot;home of the Bobo-Dioula&quot;.

The local Bobo-speaking population (related to the Mande) refers to the city simply as &quot;Sia&quot;. There are two distinct dialects of Jula spoken, based on the origins of different groups of speakers. The city is situated in the southwest of the country, in the Houet Province, some 350 km (220 mi) from Ouagadougou. Bobo-Dioulasso is significant both economically (agricultural trade, textile industry) and culturally, as it is a major center of culture and music.

== History ==

===Early History===
According to local tradition, Bobo-Dioulasso was founded as Sia in the 15th century. Populated by the Oule and Dioula subgroups of the Bobo people, it became an important market center, particularly in the export of horses southwards. Sia was therefore an important link in the developing trade routes linking Djenne and the Inner Niger Delta to Kong, Begho and ultimately the Gold Coast.

===Kong Empire===
Kong&#x27;s growing influence in the region culminated in the reign of Seku Watara, who established the Kong Empire in 1710. His brother Famagan Watara and sons Kere-Mori and Bamba Watara played important roles in conquering Sia and subjugating the native Bobo-Dioula and Bobo-Oule in the late 1730s. After Seku&#x27;s death, however, Famagan&#x27;s descendants ruled the region, known as Gwiriko, with near-autonomy from the senior branch based in Kong.

At the end of the nineteenth century, Sia consisted of two large villages, Tunuma and Sia proper, located a few hundred meters from each other and bounded by ravines on either side, carved by the We (Houët) river to the east and by its tributary Sanyo to the west. Three small satellite villages were located beyond this natural border. A number of other independent villages in the surroundings (Bindogoso, Dogona, Kwirima, Kpa) have since been absorbed by the developing city and are now within its municipal boundaries.

Kongondinn and Yemori, Watara rulers of the city, fought a series of wars against the Kenedougou Kingdom to the west in the 1870s, 80s and 90s.

===Colonial Period===
In 1896 the Bobo-Dioula, rebelling against the Watara, allied with Samory Toure in his attack on their traditional overlords, helping him to capture the nearby stronghold of Noumoudara. The local Watara leader Pintyeba appealed for help from the French, who were already established in Diebougou. On September 25, 1897 the French briefly occupied Sia after a brief but bloody confrontation. On November 23rd a military post was established, and later an administrative settlement on the east side of the We river. This became the headquarters of a district (&quot;cercle&quot;) of the same name, Bobo-Dioulasso. This military post was the starting point for one of the columns aiming to capture Sikasso, capital of Kenedougou, in April 1898.

During the 1915-16 Volta-Bani anti-colonial war, the population in the north and east of district Bobo-Dioulasso took up arms against the French colonial government. The French based their activities in the city in an effort to suppress the insurrection, while the city itself became a center for the organization of the suppression. A colonial military base was established in the southern sector of the city, adding to its growing importance.

In 1927 the French razed the old village of Tunuma and the other settlements; their population was relocated either to neighboring villages or to a previously farmed empty zone away. It was made available for redevelopment as a residential neighborhood (the current neighborhood of Tounouma).

Sia proper, which survives today as the Dioulasoba neighborhood, was partly spared this total destruction. It was dramatically modified in 1932 when a large road artery was built through it and by the widening of streets in successive urban renewal projects. Between 1926 and 1929, the French colonial government constructed a typical European grid pattern of new avenues and streets in the city, intersected by diagonals radiating from a center, with square urban lots between them. This established the framework for the modern city center.

The Abidjan Railway reached Bobo-Dioulasso in 1934, increasing its access to markets, transportation, and communications. But the growth of the city as a colonial industrial center halted because of the world economic crisis during the Great Depression, as well as the suppression of the colony of Upper Volta in 1933. The city started expanding again after World War II. Reorganization of the colony of Upper Volta in 1947 attracted business to Bobo-Dioulasso, although Ouagadougou had been selected as the capital. An early industrial center, Bobo-Dioulasso is also the hub of a rich agricultural zone, which produces food grains, fruits and seedlings (mangos, citrus), and export crops (cotton, cashews, and shea butter).
===Independence===
Due to its strong economic contributions, following the nation&#x27;s gaining independence in 1960, the city was called &quot;the economic capital of the country&quot; (as opposed to the administrative capital, Ouagadougou). Bobo-Dioulasso&#x27;s economic advantage vis-à-vis the capital has declined following decades of government policy favoring Ouagadougou. Little new industry arrived in the city during the 1980s and 1990s. Some enterprises either closed down or relocated to the capital. Economic life was primarily reduced to commerce grounded in the agriculture of the region and services. 

Since 2000 the city of Bobo-Dioulasso has enjoyed a new growth spurt, gaining in population and economic vitality. Residents have returned home following the internal crisis in neighboring Ivory Coast, and the economy has been stimulated by new demands for its goods. The central government has invested more development funds in the city; for example, the new West African Centre for Economic and Social Studies is a college intended as the first piece of development of the second university of the country.

== Architecture ==
The city features historic buildings reflecting its complex past: 
* Konsa house, the ritual center of a senior house of the Zara (or Bobo-Jula) group. 
* Dafra, a sacred natural pond and the source of the We river, in its southern quarter. The pond is a site of pilgrimage. People make offerings consumed by the giant catfish living in it.
*the mausoleum of Guimbi Ouattara, a notable ruler of Bobo-Dioulasso in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Bobo-Dioulasso has well-preserved examples of the colonial-era architecture in what is called &quot;neo-Sudanic&quot; style (examples: the museum building, the train station). A regional museum interprets the long history and artifacts recovered in archeological work. A zoo and a pottery market are among the city&#x27;s attractions.

==Education==
The &quot;École française André Malraux&quot;, a French international school, has &quot;maternelle&quot; (preschool) through &quot;collège&quot; served.

The Nazi Boni University is located in the city and was founded in 1995.

== Places of worship ==
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bobo-Dioulasso (Catholic Church), Association of Reformed Evangelical Church of Burkina Faso (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Assemblies of God, Deeper Life Bible Church, International Evangelism Center).

The Grand Mosque of Bobo-Dioulasso, possibly the largest example of Sudano-Sahelian architecture in the country, built in 1880 according to some, 1893 according to others as a part of political agreement between the king of Sya and Islamic religious leader Almamy Sidiki Sanou.

==Transportation==
The city has a railroad station along the Abidjan – Ouagadougou Railway. As of June 2014 &quot;Sitarail&quot; operated a passenger train along the line three times a week in each direction. As of August 2015 Bobo Dioulasso Airport had direct flights twice a week to both Abidjan and Ouagadougou. The city is an important road junction connecting all of Southwestern Burkina Faso with the capital, Ouagadougou, via the N-1 roadway.

==Demographics==
The original population of Bobo-Dioulasso consisted of a majority of farmers speaking the Bobo language. Associated with them were groups specializing in trade and warfare; they also speak Bobo, but identify as of distinct historical origin and ethnicity. They call themselves the &quot;Zara.&quot;

Today Bobo-Dioulasso is ethnically and linguistically very diverse, due both to its position as an old trade town, and especially to its growth during the twentieth century as a colonial administrative and military center. Jula (also called Dioula) is the lingua franca of Bobo and surrounding region of western Burkina Faso. People of the city and region speak two distinctive dialects of Jula. The common (and now dominant) Jula spoken in the streets of Bobo-Dioulasso is a close variation of Bamana, the majority language of neighboring Mali.

It was brought to the area during the French colonial administration (1898–1960) by the government interpreters and by the soldiers of the colonial army, who were majority speakers of this language. Most people speak this Jula as a second language, after the official language of French. The people of Jula ethnicity, whether trader, Muslim-clerical, or warrior origin, speak a different dialect of Jula. It is similar to that spoken in Ivory Coast, from where their ancestors are believed to have come. In the city this dialect is called Kon-Jula; it is an ethnic marker of a particular community.

The population of the city keeps rapidly rising; it rose from 904,920 in 2019 to 1,129,000 in 2023.

== Climate ==
Classified by the Köppen-Geiger system Bobo-Dioulasso has a tropical wet and dry climate (Aw). During its hottest months, its temperatures are slightly less hot than the more northern capital, Ouagadougou. The city has a dry season that spans from October through April while the wet season covers the remaining five months. The city experiences its highest temperatures during the dry season with average highs routinely exceeding . However, humidity is markedly lower during that season so the apparent temperature is more reflective of the actual temperature. The wet season in contrast features lower temperatures but much higher humidity. The apparent temperature during the wet season at times can exceed the apparent temperature during the dry season despite the lower temperatures. Bobo-Dioulasso on average sees roughly of precipitation annually.

<text>In Zen Buddhism, the keisaku (Japanese: 警策, Chinese: 香板, &quot;xiāng bǎn&quot;; kyōsaku in the Soto school) is a flat wooden stick or slat used during periods of meditation to remedy sleepiness or lapses of concentration. This is accomplished through a strike or series of strikes, usually administered on the meditator&#x27;s back and shoulders in the muscular area between the shoulder and the spine. The keisaku itself is thin and somewhat flexible; strikes with it, though they may cause momentary sting if performed vigorously, are not injurious.
