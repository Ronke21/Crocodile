<text>James Arnold Horowitz (June 10, 1925 – June 19, 2015), better known as James Salter, his pen name and later-adopted legal name, was an American novelist and short-story writer. Originally a career officer and pilot in the United States Air Force, he resigned from the military in 1957 following the successful publication of his first novel, &quot;The Hunters&quot;.

After a brief career in film writing and film directing, in 1979 Salter published the novel &quot;Solo Faces&quot;. He won numerous literary awards for his works, including belated recognition of works originally criticized at the time of their publication.

==Biography==
On June 10, 1925, Salter was born and named James Arnold Horowitz, the son of Mildred Scheff and George Horowitz. His father was a real estate broker and businessman who had graduated from West Point in November 1918 and served in the Corps of Engineers with both Army and Army Reserve. The elder Horowitz attained the rank of colonel and was a recipient of the Legion of Merit.

Horowitz grew up in Manhattan, where he attended P.S.6, and the Horace Mann School – his classmates included Julian Beck. While he intended to study at Stanford University or MIT, he entered West Point on July 15, 1942, at the urging of his father – who had rejoined the Corps of Engineers in July 1941, in anticipation of war breaking out. (With others from his original Class of 1919, George Horowitz was called back to West Point after a month of duty to complete a post-graduate officer&#x27;s course.) Like his father, Horowitz&#x27;s time at West Point was shortened due to wartime class sizes being greatly increased and the curriculum drastically shortened. He graduated in 1945 after just three years, ranked 49th in general merit in his class of 852.

He completed flight training during his first class year, with primary flight training at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and advanced training at Stewart Field, New York. On a cross-country navigation flight in May 1945, his flight became scattered and, low on fuel, he mistook a railroad trestle for a runway, crash-landing his T-6 Texan training craft into a house in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Possibly as a result, he was assigned to multi-engine training in B-25s until February 1946. He received his first unit assignment with the 6th Troop Carrier Squadron, stationed at Nielson Field, the Philippines; Naha Air Base, Okinawa; and Tachikawa Air Base, Japan. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant in January 1947.

Horowitz was transferred in September 1947 to Hickam AFB, Hawaii, then entered post-graduate studies at Georgetown University in August 1948, receiving his master&#x27;s degree in January 1950. He was assigned to the headquarters of Tactical Air Command at Langley AFB, Virginia, in March 1950, where he remained until volunteering for assignment in the Korean War. He arrived in Korea in February 1952 after transition training in the F-86 Sabre with the 75th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine. He was assigned to the 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, a renowned MiG-hunting unit. He flew more than 100 combat missions between February 12 and August 6, 1952, and was credited with a MiG-15 victory on July 4, 1952.

Horowitz subsequently was stationed in Germany and France, promoted to major, and assigned to lead an aerial demonstration team; he became a squadron operations officer, in line to become a squadron commander. Inspired by &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, in his off-duty time he wrote his first novel, &quot;The Hunters,&quot; publishing it in 1956 under the pen name &quot;James Salter&quot;. The film rights to the novel allowed Salter to leave active duty with the US Air Force in 1957 to write full-time. He also legally changed his name to Salter. Having served twelve years in the US Air Force, the last six as a fighter pilot, Salter found the transition to full-time writer difficult.

The 1958 film adaptation, &quot;The Hunters&quot; starring Robert Mitchum, was honored with acclaim for its powerful performances, moving plot, and realistic portrayal of the Korean War. Although an excellent adaptation by Hollywood standards, it was very different from the original novel, which dealt with the slow self-destruction of a 31-year-old fighter pilot, who had once been thought a &quot;hot shot&quot; but who found only frustration in his first combat experience while others around him achieved glory, some of it perhaps invented.

His 1961 novel &quot;The Arm of Flesh&quot; drew on his experiences flying with the 36th Fighter-Day Wing at Bitburg Air Base, Germany, between 1954 and 1957. An extensively-revised version of the novel was reissued in 2000 as &quot;Cassada&quot;. Salter however, later disdained both of his &quot;Air Force&quot; novels as products of youth &quot;not meriting much attention&quot;. After several years in the Air Force Reserve, he severed his military connection completely in 1961 by resigning his commission after his unit was called up to active duty for the Berlin Crisis.

He moved back to New York with his family. Salter and his first wife Ann divorced in 1975, having had four children: daughters Allan (1955-1980) and Nina (born 1957), and twin sons Claude and James (born 1962). Starting in 1976 he lived with journalist and playwright Kay Eldredge. They had a son, Theo Salter, born in 1985, and Salter and Eldredge married in Paris in 1998. Eldredge and Salter co-authored a book entitled &quot;Life Is Meals: A Food Lover&#x27;s Book of Days&quot;, in 2006.

==Writing career==
Salter took up film writing, first as a writer of independent documentary films, winning a prize at the Venice Film Festival in collaboration with television writer Lane Slate (&quot;Team, Team, Team&quot;). He also wrote for Hollywood, although disdainful of it. His last script, commissioned and then rejected by Robert Redford, became his novel, &quot;Solo Faces&quot;.

A writer of modern American fiction, Salter was critical of his own work, having said that only his 1967 novel &quot;A Sport and a Pastime&quot; comes close to living up to his standards. Set in post-war France, &quot;A Sport and a Pastime&quot; is a piece of erotica involving an American student and a young Frenchwoman, told as flashbacks in the present tense by an unnamed narrator who barely knows the student, also yearns for the woman, and freely admits that most of his narration is fantasy. Many characters in Salter&#x27;s short stories and novels reflect his passion for European culture and, in particular, for France, which he describes as a &quot;secular holy land&quot;.

Critic Jeffrey Meyers describes Salter&#x27;s style as located between “the lush romanticism of Scott Fitzgerald and the stoic realism of Ernest Hemingway”. In interviews with his biographer, William Dowie, Salter described his enthusiasm for Isaac Babel, André Gide and Thomas Wolfe. He once described his own writing (in &quot;A Sport and a Pastime&quot;) as &quot;succinct&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot;. Salter often used short sentences and sentence fragments, switching between first and third persons, as well as between the present and past tenses. His dialogue is attributed only when necessary to keep clear who is speaking, otherwise he allows the reader to draw inferences from tone and motivation.

His 1997 memoir &quot;Burning the Days&quot; uses this prose style to chronicle the impact his experiences at West Point, in the Air Force, and as a celebrity pseudo-expatriate in Europe had on the way he viewed his life-style changes. Although it appears to celebrate numerous episodes of adultery, in fact, Salter is reflecting on what has transpired and the impressions of him it has left, just as does his poignant reminiscence on the death of his daughter. A line from &quot;The Hunters&quot; expresses these feelings: &quot;They knew nothing of the past and its holiness.&quot;

Salter published a collection of short stories, &quot;Dusk and Other Stories&quot; in 1988. The collection received the PEN/Faulkner Award, and one of its stories (&quot;Twenty Minutes&quot;) became the basis for the 1996 film &quot;Boys&quot;. He was elected to The American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2000. In 2012, PEN/Faulkner Foundation selected him for the 25th PEN/Malamud Award saying that his works show the readers &quot;how to work with fire, flame, the laser, all the forces of life at the service of creating sentences that spark and make stories burn&quot;.

His final novel, &quot;All That Is,&quot; was published to excellent reviews in 2013.

Salter&#x27;s writings—including correspondence, manuscripts, and heavily revised typescript drafts for all of his published works including short stories and screenplays—are archived at the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas.

In the fall of 2014 Salter became the first Kapnick Writer-in-Residence at the University of Virginia.

He died on June 19, 2015, in Sag Harbor, New York.

==Awards and honors==
* 2014 Awarded the Fitzgerald Award for Achievement in American Literature award which is given annually in Rockville Maryland, the city where Fitzgerald, his wife, and his daughter are buried as part of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Literary Festival. 
*2013 Windham–Campbell Literature Prize
*2012 PEN/Malamud Award
*2010 Rea Award for the Short Story
*1989 PEN/Faulkner Award

==Reception==
His friend and fellow author, the Pulitzer Prize-winner Richard Ford, said, &quot;It is an article of faith among readers of fiction that James Salter writes American sentences better than anybody writing today,&quot; in his Introduction to &quot;Light Years&quot; for Penguin Modern Classics. Michael Dirda of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; is reported to have said that with a single sentence, he could break one&#x27;s heart. In an introduction to the final interview he gave before his death, &quot;Guernica&quot; described Salter as having &quot;a good claim to being the greatest living American novelist&quot;.

Writer Vivian Gornick had an altogether different take on his most recent writing. In her review of &quot;All That Is&quot; for &quot;Bookforum,&quot; she wrote &quot;Certainly, it is true that most writers have only one story in them... Then again, it is also true that it is the writer&#x27;s obligation to make the story tell more the third or fourth time around than it did the first. For this reviewer, Salter&#x27;s work fails on this score. In his eighties he is telling the story almost exactly as he told it in his forties.&quot; She also wrote that he was &quot;so out of touch with the life we are actually living&quot;.

<doc id="437532" wikidata="Q1982768" url="?curid=437532" title="Temiskaming Shores">
<text>Temiskaming Shores is a city in the Timiskaming District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It was created by the amalgamation of the town of New Liskeard, the town of Haileybury, and the township of Dymond in 2004. The city had a total population of 9,634 in the Canada 2021 Census. Temiskaming Shores is Ontario&#x27;s second-smallest city, in terms of population, after Dryden. Haileybury is the seat of Timiskaming District.

The constituent communities, alongside the neighbouring town of Cobalt, have been collectively referred to as &quot;Tri-Towns&quot; since before amalgamation. Cobalt was also part of the original Temiskaming Shores amalgamation plan, but rejected the merger.

In the Canada 2001 Census, the last Canadian census before the amalgamated city came into effect, New Liskeard had a population of 4,906, Haileybury had a population of 4,543, and Dymond had a population of 1,181.

==Geography==
 Temiskaming Shores is located along the southern edge of the Clay Belt area, near the Quebec border on the shores of Lake Timiskaming&#x27;s Wabi Bay. The separate township municipality of Harris separates the city from the Ontario-Quebec border. The nearest town on the Quebec side of the border is Notre-Dame-du-Nord.

The city is located within the Timiskaming Graben, a smaller branch of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben. A large escarpment, known as Devil&#x27;s Rock, is located near Haileybury.

===Communities===
The city includes the communities of New Liskeard, Haileybury, Dymond, and North Cobalt.

==History==
The Ottawa River, which drains into and out of Lake Timiskaming, has been a well-travelled route from the earliest times, including by Native peoples. It also served as the initial point of access to the Temiskaming area. Fort Temiscamingue was established in 1695 by French explorers. In 1794 George Gladman of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established Abitibi House on Lake Abitibi, to the north. In 1886, Alexander H. Telfer led a survey trip up Lake Timiskaming and gave a report to the Temiskaming Settlers&#x27; Association. By this time, the Quebec side of Lake Timiskaming was also being settled, and steamboats, the primary mode of transportation in the area, were ferrying new settlers into the area.
Before more settlements could be established, the Quebec-Ontario boundary north of Lake Timiskaming had to be accurately surveyed. Earlier surveys by Quebec and Ontario resulted in a boundary dispute, so the Canadian government sent a survey team to resolve the issue in 1890. William Ogilvie, who had recently distinguished himself by accurately surveying the Canada – Alaska boundary, led the expedition. A benchmark near Mattawa was used to establish an accurate benchmark north of Lake Timiskaming, using astronomical methods. From the head of Lake Timiskaming, they proceeded north to James Bay, fixing accurate positions of the provincial boundary at regular intervals using geodesy data derived from star transits. Ogilvie&#x27;s journal describe conditions in this area and the early settlers he met. His report on this expedition describes the details of this expedition.

William Murray (1840–1906) and Irvin Heard (1871–1956) were the first European settlers in the New Liskeard area, arriving in 1891. Some years later Crown Lands Agent John Armstrong was dispatched to the area to oversee formal land settlement. The settlers founded a prosperous agricultural center, taking advantage of the rich soil in the Little Claybelt region. New Liskeard was founded soon after settlers began to arrive in Dymond, and the two towns were soon incorporated, in 1903 and 1901, respectively. John Armstrong served as New Liskeard&#x27;s first mayor. His descendants still live in the area today. New Liskeard was named after Liskeard in Cornwall, England.
Haileybury was founded in 1889 by Charles Cobbold Farr, who named the newly founded town after the Haileybury and Imperial Service College, his former school in England. In 1901, Dymond Township was incorporated, and two years later in 1903, the Town of New Liskeard was established, with John Armstrong as its first mayor. Haileybury was formally incorporated as a town in 1904. Farr encouraged settlement in the area, penning his own promotional pamphlet, entitled &quot;The Lake Temiskamingue District&quot;, in an effort to attract new settlers to the region. Marketed to settlers as prime agricultural land, Haileybury had only a handful of residents until the arrival of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway in the early 1900s, and the subsequent discovery of large silver deposits in neighboring Cobalt in 1903. During the Cobalt Silver Rush, Haileybury became a &#x27;bedroom community&#x27; that served the needs of the many miners and, most famously, many mine owners and managers. These mine managers and owners were responsible for the construction of the row of stately homes, nicknamed &#x27;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&#x27; that stretched along the waterfront on what is now Lakeshore Road, many of which still stand today. In 1909, the Haileybury Hockey Club played its first and only season in the NHA. The club was taken over and moved by Montreal&#x27;s Club Antique-Canadien for the following season, and became the Montreal Canadiens. By 1912, Haileybury had been named the judicial seat for the Temiskaming Region, a title it retains to this day. The town of Haileybury annexed the neighbouring community of North Cobalt in 1971.
The region was affected by the Great Fire of 1922, considered one of the worst disasters ever to befall the area. Haileybury suffered the worst damage, and approximately ninety percent of the town was destroyed, leaving only Millionaire&#x27;s Row and a few other neighborhoods intact. The mass destruction is partially attributable to strong wind on the day of the fire. Approximately 3500 people were left homeless by the fire. The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), with many retired street cars in its yards, sent many old car bodies to serve as houses during the reconstruction. Some of these cars remained for years, and one has recently been restored and is in the museum at Haileybury. As well, the area was affected by the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake, which had its epicentre at Lac Kipawa in Quebec, approximately halfway between the Haileybury/New Liskeard area and North Bay.

In 1971, the Township Municipality of Bucke (that included North Cobalt) was amalgamated with Haileybury.

In more recent history, Dymond still functions largely as an agricultural centre, while the commercial and industrial interests in the area have mostly shifted operations to the former town of New Liskeard. Haileybury maintains its status as a judicial seat, and is also home to the new city hall. A strong link to agriculture means that Temiskaming Shores has largely avoided the boom-and-bust cycle typical of most mining- and forestry-dependent small towns in Northern Ontario. Temiskaming Shores has also become a popular retirement and recreational destination, with small retirement communities like the Bayport Village being developed in the former town of Haileybury.

A building in Haileybury, built by area businessman Peter Grant as a combination home and office for his now-defunct company Grant Forest Products, was promoted as the largest house in Canada when Grant put it on the real estate market in 2010 for an asking price of $25 million.

In 2013, Temiskaming Shores was the main filming location for the movie &quot;Skating to New York&quot;.

==Amalgamation issues==
Initially, as none of the old municipal office buildings were large enough to accommodate the expanded municipal staff of a single city, all three remained in use to house different city departments. A new city hall, located on Farr Drive in Haileybury, was completed in 2007.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Temiskaming Shores had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. English was the mother language of 66.4% of Temiskaming Shore&#x27;s population, while 28.4% of the city&#x27;s residents spoke French as a mother language.

==Transportation==
Highway 11 and Highway 65 pass through the city. The primary arterial route through Haileybury and New Liskeard also formerly held the business route designation Highway 11B.

Temiskaming Shores and Cobalt share a small public transit system, Tri-Town Transit.

The Ontario Northland bus service makes scheduled stops in New Liskeard, Dymond and Haileybury.

==Retail==
The city is the economic and service hub to a population of approximately 32,500 from small communities in the surrounding region. Professional services and large retailers continue to open in the community to service regional customers from both Ontario and Quebec.
The city&#x27;s one enclosed shopping mall, Timiskaming Square, is located in the Dymond area at 883303 Highway 65 (47.51 N, 79.67 W). Owned by Plaza REIT, it opened in 1977 and has 21 stores, anchored by Food Basics. The mall has 164,142 sq. ft. (15,249 m2) of space. Its popularity in the 1980s contributed to the decline of the downtown businesses of Haileybury and to a lesser extent New Liskeard. Since then, large Walmart and Canadian Tire stores have been built nearby, resulting in a decline in mall business. As of 2021, the mall only has 7 stores and services left: Food Basics, Dollarama, Giant Tiger, Pet Valu, TD Canada Trust, DriveTest, and Pop&#x27;s Cannabis.

Many of the mall&#x27;s customers are from Quebec, which is a short drive away on Highway 65.

During the Sunday shopping debate, the shopping centre was cited as one of the primary reasons the local representative voted in favour of the bill.

<doc id="437539" wikidata="Q529298" url="?curid=437539" title="Clonal anergy">
<text>Anergy, within the realm of immunology, characterizes the absence of a response from the body&#x27;s defense mechanisms when confronted with foreign substances. This phenomenon involves the direct induction of peripheral lymphocyte tolerance. When an individual is in a state of anergy, it signifies that their immune system is incapable of mounting a typical response against a specific antigen, typically a self-antigen. The term anergy specifically refers to lymphocytes that exhibit an inability to react to their designated antigen. Notably, anergy constitutes one of the essential processes fostering tolerance within the immune system, alongside clonal deletion and immunoregulation. These processes collectively act to modify the immune response, preventing the inadvertent self-destruction that could result from an overactive immune system.

==Mechanism==
This phenomenon was first described in B lymphocytes by Gustav Nossal and termed &quot;clonal anergy.&quot; The clones of B lymphocytes in this case can still be found alive in the circulation, but are ineffective at mounting immune responses. Later Ronald Schwartz and Marc Jenkins described a similar process operating in the T lymphocyte. Many viruses (HIV being the most extreme example) seem to exploit the immune system&#x27;s use of tolerance induction to evade the immune system, though the suppression of specific antigens is done by fewer pathogens (notably &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;).

At the cellular level, &quot;anergy&quot; is the inability of an immune cell to mount a complete response against its target. In the immune system, circulating cells called lymphocytes form a primary army that defends the body against pathogenic viruses, bacteria and parasites. There are two major kinds of lymphocytes – the T lymphocyte and the B lymphocyte. Among the millions of lymphocytes in the human body, only a few actually are specific for any particular infectious agent. At the time of infection, these few cells must be recruited and allowed to multiply rapidly. This process – called &quot;clonal expansion&quot; – allows the body to quickly mobilise an army of clones, as and when required. Such immune response is anticipatory and its specificity is assured by pre-existing clones of lymphocytes, which expand in response to specific antigen (process called &quot;clonal selection&quot;). This specific clonal army then combats the pathogen until the body is free of the infection. Following clearance of the infection, the clones that are no longer needed die away naturally.

However, a small number of the body&#x27;s army of lymphocytes are able to react with proteins that are normally present in a healthy body. The clonal expansion of those cells can lead to autoimmune diseases, wherein the body attacks itself. In order to prevent this process, lymphocytes possess an intrinsic quality-control mechanism. This machinery shuts down the lymphocytes&#x27; ability to expand, if the trigger for the expansion turns out to be the body&#x27;s own protein. T-cell anergy can arise when the T-cell does not receive appropriate co-stimulation in the presence of specific antigen recognition. B-cell anergy can be induced by exposure to soluble circulating antigen, and is often marked by a downregulation of surface IgM expression and partial blockade of intracellular signaling pathways.

==Molecular mechanism of anergy induction in T lymphocytes==
Understanding the molecular mechanism of anergy induction in T lymphocytes unveils the intricate interplay of signaling pathways governing immune responses. Upon stimulation, the T cell receptor (TCR) in conjunction with co-stimulatory receptors orchestrates a comprehensive activation of all the T-cell’s signaling pathways, collectively termed full T-cell stimulation. Among these pathways, the calcium-dependent arm of lymphocyte signaling is particularly pivotal, triggered by TCR engagement. This initiates a cascade culminating in an elevation of intracellular Ca+II concentration, a critical event in T cell activation. Under such conditions, the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin acts on the transcription factor NFAT, facilitating its translocation to the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression.

Expanding upon this complexity, during full T-cell stimulation the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 activates PI3K and other pathways, augmenting the nuclear levels of key transcription factors such as rel, NF-κB and AP-1 beyond those induced by TCR activation alone. The formation of AP-1, fos/jun heterodimer, further complexes with NFAT, creating a transcriptional complex crucial for the expression of genes associated with T-cell productive responses, including IL-2 and its receptor.

In contrast, TCR signaling in the absence of co-stimulatory receptors predominantly activates the calcium arm of the signaling pathway, leading to NFAT activation alone. However, without the concurrent induction of AP-1 by other pathways, NFAT fails to form the transcriptional complex necessary for a productive T-cell response. Instead, NFAT homodimerizes, functioning as a transcriptional factor that induces anergy in the lymphocyte.

NFAT homodimers play a direct role in the expression of anergy-associated genes, such as the ubiquitin ligase GRAIL and the protease caspase 3. Furthermore, anergized cells exhibit decreased expression levels of IL-2, TNFα, and IFNγ, characteristic of a productive response, while favoring the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Although three NFAT proteins - NFAT1, NFAT2 and NFAT4 - are preset in T-cells, they demonstrate redundancy to some extent.

In the context of antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APC), T lymphocytes undergo a productive response when the antigen is appropriately presented, activating T cell co-stimulatory receptors. However, encountering antigens not presented by the APCs or weakly presented antigens induces anergic responses in T cells. Notably, strong stimulation through IL-2 or TCR/co-stimulatory receptors can overcome anergy, highlighting the dynamic nature of immune regulation.

Moreover, recent research has illuminated the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in modulating T cell responses and maintaining immune tolerance. Tregs, characterized by the expression of the transcription factor Foxp3, exert immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting the activation and function of effector T cells. Importantly, Tregs can directly interact with anergic T cells, further reinforcing their state of unresponsiveness and promoting peripheral tolerance. This interaction involves various mechanisms, including the secretion of inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β, as well as cell-contact-dependent suppression mediated by molecules like CTLA-4. Understanding the intricate crosstalk between Tregs and anergic T cells provides valuable insights into the maintenance of immune homeostasis and has implications for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating immune responses in autoimmune diseases and transplantation.

==Clinical significance==
Anergy may be taken advantage of for therapeutic uses. The immune response to grafting of transplanted organs and tissues could be minimized without weakening the entire immune system— a side effect of immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporine. Anergy may also be used to induce activated lymphocytes to become unresponsive with autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Likewise, preventing anergy in response to a tumoral growth may help in anti-tumor responses. It might also be used for immunotherapeutic treatment of allergies.

==Dominant tolerance==
Dominant and recessive tolerance are forms of a peripheral tolerance (the other tolerance beside peripheral is a central tolerance). Where so called recessive tolerance is associated with anergized lymphocytes as described above, in the dominant form of tolerance, specialized T-reg cells which actively ablate the immune response are developed from the naive T lymphocyte. Similarly to recessive tolerance, unopposed NFAT signalling is also important for
T-reg induction. In this case, the NFAT pathway activates another transcription factor – FOXP3 that is a marker of T-regs and participates in their genetic program.

==Testing==
The &quot;Multitest Mérieux&quot; or &quot;CMI Multitest&quot; system (Multitest IMC, Istituto Merieux Italia, Rome, Italy) has been used as a general test of the level of cellular immunity. It is an intradermal test of skin reactivity (similar to tuberculin tests) in which a control (glycerol) is used with seven antigens of bacterial or fungal origin (tetanus toxoid, tuberculin, diphtheria, streptococcus, candida, trichophyton, and proteus). In this test reactions are categorized according to the number of antigens provoking a response and the summed extent of the skin response to all seven antigens. Here anergy is defined as a region of skin reactivity of 0–1 mm, hypoergy as a reaction of 2–9 mm in response to fewer than three antigens, normergic as a reaction of 10–39 mm or to three or more antigens, and hyperergy for a reaction of 40 mm or more.

==Experimental approaches to study anergy==
Various chemicals inducing/inhibiting described T cell signalling pathways can be used to study the anergy. The anergy in T cells can be induced by Ionomycin, the ionophore capable of raising intracellular concentration of calcium ions artificially.

Conversely, Ca+II chelators such as EGTA can sequester calcium ions making them unable to cause the anergy. Blocking of the pathway leading to the anergy can be also done by cyclosporin A, which is capable of inhibiting calcineurin – the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating of NFAT priming its activation.

PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, along with ionomycin is used to induce full T cells activation by mimicking signals provided naturally by TCR/costimulatory receptors activation.

<text>Robert Lane Saget (May 17, 1956 – January 9, 2022) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, director, and television host. He portrayed Danny Tanner on the sitcom &quot;Full House&quot; (1987–1995) and its sequel &quot;Fuller House&quot; (2016–2020). Saget was the original host of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; (1989–1997), and the voice of narrator Ted Mosby on the sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; (2005–2014). He was also known for his adult-oriented stand-up comedy, and his 2014 album &quot;That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Talkin&#x27; About&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album.

== Early life ==
Robert Lane Saget was born into a Jewish family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 17, 1956, the son of hospital administrator Rosalyn and supermarket chain executive Benjamin Saget. Early in his life, his family moved to Norfolk, Virginia, where he briefly attended Lake Taylor High School. He later said that his sense of humor developed while he was a rebellious student at the Conservative synagogue Temple Israel in Norfolk. Due to a lack of family in Norfolk, he returned to Philadelphia for his bar mitzvah. The family later moved from Norfolk to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, where Saget met Larry Fine of The Three Stooges and listened to him tell stories. The family then moved back to the Philadelphia area prior to his senior year, and he graduated from Abington Senior High School. Saget originally intended to become a doctor, but his Honors English teacher saw his creative potential and urged him to pursue an acting career.

Saget attended Temple University&#x27;s film school, where he created &quot;Through Adam&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, a black-and-white film about a boy who received reconstructive facial surgery; he received an award of merit in the Student Academy Awards. While attending university, he took the train to New York City and perform at comedy clubs such as The Improv and Catch a Rising Star; his act included a section where he played the Beatles song &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, using a water bottle to make his guitar appear to actually weep. He graduated from Temple with a BA in 1978. He intended to take graduate courses at the University of Southern California, but quit after only a few days. He later described himself at that time as a &quot;cocky, overweight 22-year-old&quot; who &quot;had a gangrenous appendix taken out, almost died, [and] got over being cocky or overweight&quot;. He further discussed his burst appendix on &quot;Anytime with Bob Kushell&quot;, revealing that it happened on the Fourth of July at the UCLA Medical Center, and that surgeons put ice on the area for seven hours before taking his appendix out and finding that it had become gangrenous.

== Career ==

Following a short stint as a member of CBS&#x27; &quot;The Morning Program&quot; in early 1987, Saget was cast as Danny Tanner in &quot;Full House&quot;, which became a success with family viewers, and landed in the Nielsen ratings&#x27; Top 30 beginning with season three. In 1989, Saget began as the host of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, a role he held until 1997. During the early 1990s, Saget worked on both &quot;Full House&quot; and &quot;AFV&quot; simultaneously. In 2009, he returned to &quot;AFV&quot; for the 20th-anniversary one-hour special co-hosted with Tom Bergeron.
Saget directed the 1996 ABC television film &quot;For Hope&quot;, which was inspired by the life story of his sister, Gay Saget, who had died from scleroderma three years earlier. In 1998, he directed his first feature film, &quot;Dirty Work&quot;, starring Norm Macdonald and Artie Lange. Released one year after he left his role as host of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, the film received broadly negative reviews from critics and earned low box office returns. However, it has since become a cult favorite, due partially to Artie Lange&#x27;s later popularity on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; where the film is sometimes mentioned, often in unflattering terms. In 1998, Saget made a cameo appearance as a cocaine addict in the stoner comedy &quot;Half Baked&quot;.

In 2001, Saget took on another widowed-dad role, starring on &quot;Raising Dad&quot; on The WB. It co-starred Kat Dennings, Brie Larson, and Jerry Adler and lasted only one season, from October 5, 2001, to May 10, 2002. He served as the voice of the future Ted Mosby, who narrated the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, which ran for nine seasons from September 19, 2005, to March 31, 2014. He was host of the NBC game show &quot;1 vs. 100&quot; from 2006 to 2008. His HBO comedy special, &quot;That Ain&#x27;t Right&quot;, came out on DVD on August 28, 2007. It is dedicated to his father, Ben Saget, who died at age 89 on January 30, 2007, due to complications from congestive heart failure. From 2005 to 2010, Saget had a recurring role in four episodes of the HBO TV series &quot;Entourage&quot; playing a parody version of himself. He latered appear in the 2015 feature film based on the series. 2005 also saw him partake in &quot;Rollin&#x27; with Saget&quot;, a song by Jamie Kennedy and Stuart Stone, about a night out with him that shows off his raunchier behaviors. The video appeared on the MTV series &quot;Blowin&#x27; Up&quot;, and he came to use it as a pseudo-theme song on his stand-up tours and website.
Saget wrote, directed, and starred in &quot;Farce of the Penguins&quot;, a parody of 2005&#x27;s &quot;March of the Penguins&quot;, which was released direct-to-DVD, in January 2007. Saget appeared in the Broadway musical &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot; for a limited four-month engagement. He played &quot;Man in Chair&quot; while Jonathan Crombie, who normally played the character on Broadway, was with the national tour of the musical. On January 4, 2008, Saget&#x27;s caricature was unveiled at Sardi&#x27;s Restaurant. In April 2009, he debuted in a new sitcom along with his co-star Cynthia Stevenson on ABC called &quot;Surviving Suburbia&quot;. The series, which was originally slated to air on The CW, ended after a single abbreviated season. In 2010, Saget starred in the A&amp;E series &quot;Strange Days&quot;, in which he followed others in different activities and lifestyles, documenting their adventures in unusual ways.

In 2014, his book &quot;Dirty Daddy&quot; was released, in which he writes about his career, comedy influences, and experiences with life and death. He embarked on a small tour in support of the book, including the Pemberton Music Festival, where he introduced Snoop Dogg prior to performing his own set. In the same year, he toured Australia for the first time with a stand-up show called &quot;Bob Saget Live: The Dirty Daddy Tour&quot;. The show was performed in the major cities of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Perth.

In 2015 and 2016, he guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;Grandfathered&quot;, starring and produced by his &quot;Full House&quot; co-star John Stamos. From 2016 to 2020, Saget reprised his role as Danny Tanner for fifteen episodes of &quot;Full House&quot; sequel series, &quot;Fuller House&quot;, including the series premiere and finale.

In 2017, he released another stand-up special, &quot;Bob Saget: Zero to Sixty&quot;.

In 2019, he was announced as host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Videos After Dark&quot;. Saget also hosted the game show &quot;Nashville Squares&quot; on CMT, and made his first of three appearances as a panelist on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.

In 2020, Saget competed in season four of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Squiggly Monster&quot;. Saget also launched a podcast titled &quot;Bob Saget&#x27;s Here for You&quot; with Studio71. Its 130th and final episode, with comedian Dane Cook, was released posthumously on January 31, 2022.

He also made an appearance on Nikki Glaser&#x27;s E! series &quot;Welcome Home Nikki Glaser?&quot; in an episode that aired on June 5, 2022.

== Personal life ==
Saget married Sherri Kramer in 1982, and they had three daughters Aubrey (b. 1987), Lara Melanie (b. 1989), and Jennifer Belle (b. 1992) before divorcing in 1997. He was later married to television presenter Kelly Rizzo from 2018 until his death in 2022.

Saget was a board member of the Scleroderma Research Foundation. His efforts benefited celebrities such as actress Regina Hall. In an interview with &quot;Ability&quot;, he discussed how his sister was diagnosed with scleroderma at 43 and died at 47. She had previously been misdiagnosed numerous times.

==Death==
At about 4 p.m. ET on January 9, 2022, Saget was found dead in his room at a Ritz-Carlton hotel near Williamsburg in Orange County, Florida. At the time of his death, Saget was on a stand-up tour and had performed in Ponte Vedra Beach the previous evening. His funeral took place on January 14, and he was buried at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery near the graves of his parents and sister.

An autopsy report released on February 9 found that Saget had blunt head trauma from an accidental blow to the back of his head, most likely from a fall, and had subsequently died from the resulting injuries (subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage) in his sleep. He was infected with COVID-19 at the time, though there were no signs that it played a role in his death. On February 15, Saget&#x27;s family sued to prevent county officials from releasing additional documents from the investigation of his death, arguing that their graphic content would present privacy violations. On March 14, a permanent injunction was issued against releasing the documents.

===Tributes===
News of Saget&#x27;s death broke during a broadcast of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, of which he was the original host, and ABC interrupted the program to announce it. A tribute video was posted on the show&#x27;s official YouTube channel, and a dedication to Saget was added before the credits of the following episode. Clips of Saget&#x27;s hosting of the show were run from January 16 to the end of 2021–22 season on &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; as tribute as well.

Saget had been honored with donations and offers to help the charity Scleroderma Research Foundation (SRF), whose board of directors Saget served on since 2003. According to a statement made by the foundation&#x27;s executive director on January 13, 2022, the foundation received donations from more than 1,500 donors from all over the world, totaling more than $90,000. Additionally, a donation of $1.5 million was awarded to the charity by one of its board members in the form of a grant, which will match every donation made in memory of Saget.

A tribute special was filmed at The Comedy Store by Saget&#x27;s longtime friend Mike Binder on January 30; titled &quot;Dirty Daddy: The Bob Saget Tribute&quot; and featuring footage from a private memorial held at Jeff Franklin&#x27;s home, it was released on Netflix on June 10, 2022.

<doc id="437546" wikidata="Q2139866" url="?curid=437546" title="Baron Bodissey">
<text>Unspiek, Baron Bodissey, is a fictional character referred to in many of the novels of speculative-fiction author Jack Vance. Within those novels he has the status of an authority, but he is sometimes referred to with amusement or scepticism. Like the &#x27;mad poet&#x27; Navarth, he first appeared in the Demon Princes sequence but also is alluded to in a number of other unrelated stories. Unlike Navarth, the Baron never appears in person in these novels, but his monumental, many-volume work &quot;Life&quot; is frequently quoted. The lengthiest citations from it appear, with varying degrees of apparent relevance, as epigraphs to various chapters in the &quot;Demon Princes&quot; novels. (Vance characteristically makes use of substantial passages from imaginary writings, interviews or judicial transcripts as chapter-heading material, especially in that series.) Otherwise, the Baron and his work are occasionally referred to in passing or quoted by characters in the tales. Fictional (and always negative) reviews of &quot;Life&quot; also appear in &quot;The Killing Machine&quot; and &quot;The Face&quot;, usually dismissing it as snobbish, elitist and pretentious; one reviewer expresses a desire to thrash the Baron within an inch of his life before buying him a drink.

In a footnote in &quot;Night Lamp&quot; Vance informs us, perhaps definitively, that the Baron&#x27;s great work &quot;Life&quot; consisted of twelve volumes (earlier novels suggest six or ten) and that it was in nature a ‘philosophical encyclopedia’. In the same passage Vance also asserts that towards the end of his life he ‘was excommunicated from the human race by the Assembly of Egalitarians. Baron Bodissey’s comment was succinct: &quot;The point is moot&quot;. To this day the most erudite thinkers of the Gaean Reach ponder the significance of the remark’.

Although Bodissey often expresses himself in pompous language, many of his &quot;dicta&quot; (a selection is given below) appear good sense, and it may be that he serves, at least occasionally, as a mouthpiece for Vance&#x27;s personal opinions.

An overly zealous cultural anthropologist and ethnologist named Kalikari Stone, Baron Bodissey, working on a grant from the Historical Institute of Naval Research on the planet Riverain, appears in Hayford Peirce&#x27;s novel &quot;The Thirteenth Majestral&quot; (1989), a pastiche written in the manner of Jack Vance. He saves the book&#x27;s protagonist from a dire end, although, to his dismayed surprise, at the cost of his own life.

==The Wisdom of Baron Bodissey==

* [On religious wars] of all wars, these are the most detestable, since they are waged for no tangible gain, but only to impose a set of arbitrary credos on another. (From &quot;Life&quot;, Volume I; &quot;The Face&quot;, Chapter 3)
* The malefactor becomes the creature of his own deeds. (From &quot;Life&quot;, Volume I; &quot;The Face&quot;, Chapter 6)
* &quot;Morality&quot;, the most troublesome and confusing word of all. There is no single or supreme morality; there are many, each defining the mode by which a system of entities optimally interacts. (From &quot;Life&quot;, Volume I; &quot;The Book of Dreams&quot;, Chapter 3)
* . . . when land is vast and easily available, as in the broaching of a new continent or a new world, nothing can keep different sorts of people in close contact. They migrate to new places and particularize, whereupon languages mutate, costumes and conventions elaborate, aesthetic symbols take on fresh meanings. (From the Introduction to &quot;Life&quot;, Volume II; &quot;The Book of Dreams&quot;, Chapter 11; in the same chapter the Baron&#x27;s &#x27;Introduction to Volume II&#x27; is described as &#x27;famous&#x27;)
* I have examined the native life forms of over two thousand planets. I have noted many examples of convergent evolution, but many more of divergence. (From &quot;Life&quot;, Volume II; &quot;The Star King&quot;, Chapter 2)
* We must not confuse statistical probability with some transcendental and utterly compelling force. (From &quot;Life&quot;, Volume II; &quot;The Star King&quot;, Chapter 2)
* For the lack of a more precise and universal term the temptation to use the word &quot;intelligence&quot; incorrectly is well-nigh irresistible, but can be countenanced only when the word is set off by quotes, Viz: my own monograph (which I include in the appendix to Volume Eight of this slight and by no means comprehensive series). (From &quot;Life&quot;, Volume II; &quot;The Book of Dreams&quot;, Chapter 18)
* As a society matures, the struggle for survival imperceptibly graduates and changes emphasis, and becomes what can only be termed the quest for pleasure. (From &quot;Life&quot;, Volume III; &quot;The Star King&quot;, Chapter 6)
* Luxury and privilege are the perquisites of wealth. This would appear a notably bland remark, but it is much larger than it seems. If one listens closely, he hears deep and far below the mournful chime of inevitability. (From &quot;Life&quot;, Volume III; &quot;The Face&quot;, Chapter 14)
* When erudition comes in, poetry departs. (From &quot;Life&quot;, Volume IV; &quot;The Killing Machine&quot;, Chapter 10)
* [Baron Bodissey] pointed out that democracy could only function in a relatively homogeneous society of equivalent individuals. He described a district dedicated to democracy where the citizenry consisted of two hundred wolves and nine hundred squirrels. When zoning ordinances and public health laws were put into effect, the wolves were obliged to live in trees and eat nuts. (&quot;Araminta Station&quot;, Chapter 5)
* Towns behave in many respects like living organisms, which across time evolve and adapt so exactly to the landscape, the weather, and the requirements of the inhabitants that there is very little thrust for change. Parallel to these considerations the forces of tradition exert a like effect upon the character of the town; and indeed, the older the town, the more rigid its tendencies towards immutability. (From ‘Reflections upon the Morphology of Settled Places’, &quot;Life&quot;, Volume 11; &quot;Ecce and Old Earth&quot;, Chapter VIII)
* To create a society based on caste distinction, a minimum of two individuals is both necessary and sufficient. (&quot;Throy&quot;, Chapter 1)
* Only losers cry out for fair play. (&quot;Night Lamp&quot;, Chapter 2)
* Sleep when you are dead. (&quot;Ecce and Old Earth&quot;, Chapter III)

<text>John Leroy Hennessy (born September 22, 1952) is an American computer scientist who is chairman of Alphabet Inc. (Google). Hennessy is one of the founders of MIPS Technologies and Atheros, and also the tenth President of Stanford University. Hennessy announced that he would step down in the summer of 2016. He was succeeded as president by Marc Tessier-Lavigne. Marc Andreessen called him &quot;the godfather of Silicon Valley.&quot;

Along with David Patterson, Hennessy was a recipient of the 2017 Turing Award for their work in developing the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture, which is now used in 99% of new computer chips.

== Early life and education ==
Hennessy was raised in Huntington, New York, as one of six children. His father was an aerospace engineer, and his mother was a teacher before raising her children. He is of Irish-Catholic descent, with some of his ancestors arriving in America during the potato famine in the 19th century.

He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from Villanova University, and his master&#x27;s degree and Doctor of Philosophy in computer science from Stony Brook University.

== Career and research==
Hennessy became a Stanford faculty member in 1977. In 1981, he began the MIPS project to investigate RISC processors, and in 1984, he used his sabbatical year to found MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to commercialize the technology developed by his research. In 1987, he became the Willard and Inez Kerr Bell Endowed Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

Hennessy was director of Stanford&#x27;s Computer System Laboratory (1989–93), a research center run by Stanford&#x27;s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science departments. He was chair of the Department of Computer Science (1994–96) and Dean of the School of Engineering (1996–99).

In 1999, Stanford President Gerhard Casper appointed Hennessy to succeed Condoleezza Rice as Provost of Stanford University. When Casper stepped down to focus on teaching in 2000, the Stanford Board of Trustees named Hennessy to succeed Casper as president. In 2008, Hennessy earned a salary of $1,091,589 ($702,771 base salary, $259,592 deferred benefits, $129,226 non-tax benefits), the 23rd highest among all American university presidents.

Hennessy has been a board member of Google (later Alphabet Inc.), Cisco Systems, Atheros Communications, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2008.

On October 14, 2010, Hennessy was presented a khata by the 14th Dalai Lama before the latter addressed Maples Pavilion.

In December 2010, Hennessy coauthored an editorial with Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust urging the passage of the DREAM Act; the legislation did not pass the 111th United States Congress.

In 2013, Hennessy became a judge for the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. He has remained on the judging panel for the subsequent awards in 2015 and 2017.

In June 2015, Hennessy announced that he would step down as Stanford president in summer 2016.

In 2016, Hennessy co-founded the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program; he serves as its inaugural director. The program has a $750 million endowment to fully fund graduate students at Stanford for up to three years. The inaugural class of 51 scholars from 21 countries arrived at Stanford in the fall of 2018.

In February 2018, Hennessy was announced as the new Chairman of Alphabet Inc., Google&#x27;s parent company.

Hennessy has a history of strong interest and involvement in college-level computer education. He co-authored, with David Patterson, two well-known books on computer architecture, &quot;Computer Organization and Design: the Hardware/Software Interface&quot; and &quot;Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach&quot;, which introduced the DLX RISC architecture. They have been widely used as textbooks for graduate and undergraduate courses since 1990.

Hennessy also contributed to updating Donald Knuth&#x27;s MIX processor to the MMIX. Both are model computers used in Knuth&#x27;s classic series, &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;. MMIX is Knuth&#x27;s DLX equivalent.

<doc id="437554" wikidata="Q447609" url="?curid=437554" title="Trevor Berbick">
<text>Trevor Berbick (1 August 1954 – 28 October 2006) was a Jamaican professional boxer who competed from 1976 to 2000. He won the WBC heavyweight title in 1986 by defeating Pinklon Thomas, then lost it in his first defense in the same year to Mike Tyson. Berbick was the last boxer to fight Muhammad Ali, defeating him in 1981 by unanimous decision.

As an amateur, Berbick won a bronze medal in the heavyweight division at the 1975 Pan American Games. In both his early and late professional career he held the Canadian heavyweight title twice, from 1979 to 1986 and 1999 to 2001. Berbick is the only boxer to have fought Muhammad Ali, Larry Holmes, and Mike Tyson.

==Amateur career==
At 22, Berbick represented his native Jamaica in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada as a heavyweight boxer, despite having had only 11 prior amateur bouts. His lack of experience was evident as he lost to the eventual silver medalist, Mircea Şimon of Romania. However, he still displayed a lot of promise as a young heavyweight boxer. The previous year, in his only bout at the Pan American Games in Mexico City, Berbick lost a decision to future heavyweight champion Michael Dokes in the semi-finals, winning a bronze medal.

Leroy Caldwell, a boxer who fought almost all notable top-ranked heavyweights of the 1970s and early 1980s, including several world champions, recalled that Berbick was his most talented opponent.

==Professional career==
Berbick left Jamaica after the Olympics. He opted to settle in Montreal and fight professionally out of Halifax. He won his first 11 fights (10 by knockout) before suffering his first pro loss to another rising contender, Bernardo Mercado, on 3 April 1979. As an amateur, Berbick had soundly beaten Mercado. However, with 10 seconds remaining in the first round of their only professional meeting, Berbick walked into a punch and was knocked out.

A 1980 upset of ex-champ John Tate (9th-round KO) secured a title shot against Larry Holmes on 11 April 1981, but Berbick lost a 15-round unanimous decision. In his second fight after the loss, he beat 39-year-old Muhammad Ali by unanimous decision in the final fight of Ali&#x27;s career.

In 1982, he beat undefeated prospect Greg Page, and in 1984 he moved to Miramar, Florida and signed with promoter Don King. Wins over undefeated Mitch &quot;Blood&quot; Green and David Bey scored him another title fight.

Berbick won the WBC world heavyweight title by upsetting Pinklon Thomas with a unanimous decision on 22 March 1986. The champion Thomas was a 6.5-1 favorite, however Berbick won a battle of attrition by wearing Thomas down with his strength and quickness. Almost knocking down Thomas in the 11th round with a powerful left hook. Both fighter&#x27;s faces showed the &quot;meanness and toughness&quot; of the battle; Berbick marked around both eyes, Thomas cut in the corner of his left eye. The scores for Berbick were 115/113 twice, and 115/114. The Associated Press (AP) scored it 116-113 for Berbick.

However, his reign as champion would be brief.

On 22 November, in his first defense of the title, Berbick took on Mike Tyson, who was looking to break Floyd Patterson&#x27;s record and become, at the age of twenty, the youngest ever heavyweight champion. In the second round, Tyson dropped Berbick with a quick knockdown. Berbick was quickly overwhelmed by his opponent and late in the round, he went down again. The champion rose to his feet, but immediately stumbled backward and fell back to the canvas. Berbick tried twice more to make it to his feet but fell both times, and referee Mills Lane stopped counting and waved the fight off to end Berbick&#x27;s reign as champion.

In 1991, he traveled to the UWFi promotion in Japan to fight Nobuhiko Takada in a &quot;boxer vs. wrestler&quot; bout. Berbick claimed that he had been double-crossed and that he had expected the fight to be like American kickboxing, but it turned out that the rules allowed Takada to kick Berbick below the belt, and according to UWFi trainer Pat McCarthy, &quot;no rules were ever changed, and [Berbick] just never wanted to listen&quot;. Berbick refused to mount any offense, instead repeatedly complaining to the referee as Takada kicked him repeatedly in the legs. Takada claimed victory by default when Berbick exited the ring.

Berbick resumed his boxing career in 1994, frequently fighting on the &quot;USA Tuesday Night Fights&quot;. He would score a mild upset over Melvin Foster but would go on to lose to prospects such as Jimmy Thunder and Hasim Rahman. He eventually fought his last bout in 2000 against Canadian journeyman Shane Sutcliffe, winning a 12-round unanimous decision. Afterwards, a CAT scan revealed a blood clot in his brain and his boxing license was revoked. His final professional record was 49 wins (33 by knockout), 11 losses, and 1 draw.

==Outside the ring==
Berbick was a preacher at the Moments of Miracles Pentecostal church in Las Vegas.

===Rape conviction===
Berbick was arrested on a number of occasions throughout his life and was sentenced in Florida to 5 years in prison for raping his children&#x27;s babysitter in 1992. He served only 15 months. In 1997, he violated his parole and was deported from the United States to Canada. Due to his legal issues, he also had problems staying in Canada, losing his landed immigrant status and being ordered back to Jamaica in 1999. Later in 1999 he won the right to remain in Canada.

===Feud with Larry Holmes===
Berbick had a well-publicized feud with Larry Holmes, whom he fought in the ring in 1981. Their feud culminated in a public confrontation and brawl in 1991, which was caught on tape. After a verbal altercation indoors, Berbick was outside complaining about being kicked and punched by Larry Holmes when Holmes climbed atop a parked car and launched himself at Berbick. Holmes was furious with Berbick badmouthing his family. The footage ends as the two are separated by police and others.

===Retirement===
Berbick retired in Florida to be with his wife and four children (he had three children with his first wife in Montreal) and started to train boxers at Kenny Barrett&#x27;s Gym in Tamarac, Florida. Berbick&#x27;s problems escalated. He was again deported from the U.S. on 2 December 2002.

==Death==
On 28 October 2006, Berbick was murdered at a church in Norwich, Jamaica, by an assailant wielding a steel pipe. He sustained repeated blows to the head and died at the scene.

Police arrested two men, one of whom was Berbick&#x27;s 20-year-old nephew Harold Berbick, in connection with the murder. They were interrogated at the Port Antonio police station in Portland early on the morning of 29 October. Local residents indicated that the suspect was involved in a land dispute with Berbick. On 3 November it was reported that Berbick&#x27;s nephew, 20-year-old Harold Berbick, and an unidentified 18-year-old man had been charged with his murder by Jamaican police. On 20 December 2007, Harold Berbick was convicted for the murder of his uncle. His accomplice, Kenton Gordon, was convicted of manslaughter and both men were sentenced on 11 January 2008. Harold Berbick was sentenced to life in prison; Kenton Gordon was sentenced to fourteen years in prison.

Trevor Berbick was buried at the Berbick family plot in Norwich, Port Antonio, Portland, Jamaica.

<doc id="437563" wikidata="Q638783" url="?curid=437563" title="Edwin Morgan (poet)">
<text>Edwin George Morgan (27 April 1920 – 19 August 2010) was a Scottish poet and translator associated with the Scottish Renaissance. He is widely recognised as one of the foremost Scottish poets of the 20th century. In 1999, Morgan was made the first Glasgow Poet Laureate. In 2004, he was named as the first Makar or National Poet for Scotland.

==Life and career==
Morgan was born in Glasgow and grew up in Rutherglen. His parents were Presbyterian. He convinced his parents to finance his membership of several book clubs in Glasgow. The &quot;Faber Book of Modern Verse&quot; (1936) was a &quot;revelation&quot; to him, he later said.

Morgan entered the University of Glasgow in 1937. He studied French and Russian, while self-educating in &quot;a good bit of Italian and German&quot; as well. After interrupting his studies to serve in World War II as a non-combatant conscientious objector with the Royal Army Medical Corps, Morgan graduated in 1947 and became a lecturer at the university. He worked there until his retirement as a full professor in 1980.

Morgan described &#x27;CHANGE RULES!&#x27; as &#x27;the supreme graffito&#x27;, whose liberating double-take suggests both a lifelong commitment to formal experimentation and his radically democratic left-wing political perspectives. From traditional sonnet to blank verse, from epic seriousness to camp and ludic nonsense; and whether engaged in time-travelling space fantasies or exploring contemporary developments in physics and technology, the range of Morgan&#x27;s voices is a defining attribute.

Morgan first expressed his identity as a gay man in &quot;Nothing Not Giving Messages: Reflections on his Work and Life&quot; (1990). He had written many famous love poems, among them &quot;Strawberries&quot; and &quot;The Unspoken&quot;, in which the love object was not gendered; this was partly because of legal problems at the time but also out of a desire to universalise them, as he made clear in an interview with Marshall Walker. At the opening of the Glasgow LGBT Centre in 1995, he read a poem he had written for the occasion, and presented it to the centre as a gift.

In 2002, he became the patron of Our Story Scotland. At the opening of the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh on 9 October 2004, Liz Lochhead read a poem written for the occasion by Morgan, titled &quot;Poem for the Opening of the Scottish Parliament&quot;. She was announced as Morgan&#x27;s successor as Scots Makar in January 2011.

Near the end of his life, Morgan reached a new audience after collaborating with the Scottish band Idlewild on their album &quot;The Remote Part&quot;. In the closing moments of the album&#x27;s final track &quot;In Remote Part/ Scottish Fiction&quot;, he recites a poem, &quot;Scottish Fiction&quot;, written specifically for the song.

In 2007, Morgan contributed two poems to the compilation &quot;Ballads of the Book&quot;, for which a range of Scottish writers created poems to be made into songs by Scottish musicians. Morgan&#x27;s songs &quot;The Good Years&quot; and &quot;The Weight of Years&quot; were performed by Karine Polwart and Idlewild respectively.

Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney &quot;[paid] formal homage&quot; during a 2005 visit.

In later life Morgan was cared for at a residential home as his health worsened. He published a collection in April 2010, months before his death, titled &quot;Dreams and Other Nightmares&quot; to mark his 90th birthday. Up until his death, he was the last survivor of the canonical &#x27;Big Seven&#x27; (the others being Hugh MacDiarmid, Robert Garioch, Norman MacCaig, Iain Crichton Smith, George Mackay Brown, and Sorley MacLean).
On 19 August 2010, Edwin Morgan died of pneumonia in Glasgow at the age of 90. The Scottish Poetry Library made the announcement in the morning. Tributes came from, among others, politicians Alex Salmond and Iain Gray, as well as Carol Ann Duffy, the UK Poet Laureate. In his will he left almost £1 million to the Scottish National Party. Morgan also left £45,000 to a number of friends, former colleagues and charity organisations and set aside another £1 million for the creation of the Edwin Morgan Poetry Award, an annual award scheme for young poets in Scotland. In 2012, The Edwin Morgan Trust was established to administer the Award which the poet wished to create from the earnings of his writing career. In April 2020 The Edwin Morgan Trust celebrated his life and work with a year long centenary programme.

==Poetry==

Morgan worked in a wide range of forms and styles, from the sonnet to concrete poetry. His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; appeared in 1990. He has also translated from a wide range of languages, including Russian, Hungarian, French, Italian, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Old English (&quot;Beowulf&quot;). Many of these are collected in &quot;Rites of Passage. Selected Translations&quot; (1976). His 1952 translation of &quot;Beowulf&quot; has become a standard translation in America.

Morgan was also influenced by the American beat poets, with their simple, accessible ideas and language being prominent features in his work.

His poetry may be studied as a Scottish Text for National 5 English. Currently, if Edwin Morgan is studied at National 5, pupils study: &quot;Winter&quot; – a depressed narrator describing Bingham&#x27;s pond during winter; &quot;In the Snackbar&quot;; &quot;Glasgow 5 March 1971&quot;; &quot;Good Friday&quot; – a poem about a bus journey on the Christian holiday; &quot;Trio&quot; – a tale about the power of friendship; &quot;Glasgow Sonnet (I)&quot; – a petrarchan sonnet about poverty.

In 1968 Morgan wrote &quot;Starlings in George Square&quot;. This poem could be read as a comment on society&#x27;s reluctance to accept the integration of different races. Other people have also considered it to be about the Russian Revolution in which &quot;Starling&quot; could be a reference to &quot;Stalin&quot;.

Other notable poems include:

* &quot;The Death of Marilyn Monroe&quot; (1962) – an outpouring of emotion and a social criticism after the death of prominent actress, Marilyn Monroe
* &quot;King Billy&quot; (1968) – flashback of the gang warfare in Glasgow led by Billy Fullerton in the 1930s.
* &quot;Glasgow 5 March 1971&quot; – robbery by two youths by pushing an unsuspecting couple through a shop window on Sauchiehall Street
* &quot;In the Snackbar&quot; – concise description of an encounter with a disabled pensioner in a Glasgow café.
* &quot;A Good Year for Death&quot; (26 September 1977) – a description of five famous people from the world of popular culture who died in 1977
* &quot;Poem for the Opening of the Scottish Parliament&quot; – which was read by Liz Lochhead at the opening ceremony because he was too ill to read it in person. (9 October 2004)

<doc id="437566" wikidata="Q301261" url="?curid=437566" title="Musa ibn Nusayr">
<text>Musa ibn Nusayr ( &quot;Mūsá bin Nuṣayr&quot;; 640 – c. 716) was an Arab general and governor who served under the Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I. He ruled over the Muslim provinces of North Africa (Ifriqiya), and directed the Islamic conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom that controlled the Iberian Peninsula and part of what is now southern France (Septimania).

==Background==
Various suggestions have been made as to his ancestry. Some say his father belonged to the Lakhmid clan of semi-nomads who lived east of the Euphrates and were allies of the Sassanians, while others claim he belonged to the Banu Bakr confederation. One account stated that Musa&#x27;s father was taken captive after the fall of the Mesopotamian city of Ayn al-Tamr (633). According to this account, he was an Arab Christian who was one of a number being held hostage there. However, al-Baladhuri, relating the same events, states he was an Arab of the Balī tribe, from Jabal al-Jalīl in Palestine.

As a slave, Musa&#x27;s father entered the service of Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan (governor of Egypt and son of the caliph Marwan I) who gave him his freedom. He returned to Syria where Musa was born at a place called Kafarmara or Kafarmathra. The date of his birth has been given as 640.

Musa was made co-governor of Iraq by the caliph Abd al-Malik, together with the caliph&#x27;s brother Bishr ibn Marwan. There was some quarrel over missing tax money, and Musa was given the choice: pay a huge fine, or pay with his head. His father&#x27;s patron, Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan, had a high opinion of Musa, and paid the ransom; he was later responsible for appointing Musa to be governor of Ifriqiya.

==Islamic conquest of Maghreb==

Hasan ibn al-Nu&#x27;man was sent to continue the Islamic conquest in North Africa all the way to Morocco. He was relieved of his command for allowing continuing Byzantine attacks. Musa bin Nusayr was then sent to renew the attacks against the Berbers. But he did not impose Islam by force, rather, he respected Berber traditions and used diplomacy in subjugating them. This proved highly successful, as many Berbers converted to Islam and even entered his army as soldiers and officers, possibly including Tariq bin Ziyad who would lead the later Islamic expedition in Iberia.

===Governor===
In 698, Musa was made the governor of Ifriqiya and was responsible for completing the conquest of North Africa and of the Balearic Islands and Sardinia. He was the first governor of Ifriqiya not to be subordinate to the governor of Egypt. He was the first Muslim general to take Tangiers and occupy it; his troops also conquered the Sous, effectively taking control of all of the northern half of Morocco. He also had to deal with constant attacks from the Byzantine navy and he built a navy that would go on to conquer the islands of Ibiza, Majorca, and Menorca.

==Conquest of Al-Andalus==

(Note: Most of what follows in this section is to be found first in Ibn Abd al-Hakam, then repeated by others, e.g. the &quot;Akhbār majmūʿa&quot;, with more detail but little real variation.)

===Background===
Muslim and Christian sources quote that while Musa bin Nusayr was eager to cross the Straits of Gibraltar to Hispania, he determined to do so only when a Visigoth nobleman, Julian, Count of Ceuta, had encouraged him to invade Iberia, telling him of the people&#x27;s sufferings and the injustice of their king, Roderic, while giving him cause for conquest by telling him of the riches that would be found, and of the many palaces, gardens and beauties of Hispania. Legend tells that Julian wished for the fall of the Visigothic kingdom because his daughter, Florinda la Cava, had been raped by Roderic.

===Invasion===

After a successful minor raid on the Spanish coast at Tarifa where the raiding force returned with a booty captured without any reported resistance, Musa decided to land a larger invasion force. Tariq bin Ziyad crossed the strait with approximately 7,000 Berbers and Arabs, and landed at Gibraltar (from Jebel Tariq, meaning Tariq&#x27;s mountain in Arabic). The expedition&#x27;s purpose must have been to conduct further raids and explore the territory. Tariq&#x27;s army contained some guides supplied by Julian. Three weeks after his landing, the Muslims were faced with a superior Visigoth royal army of 100,000 troops under Roderic. The Muslims won the Battle of Guadalete, and the entire Visigoth nobility was all but exterminated at the battle. The Muslims then marched towards Córdoba, bypassing several strong fortifications. The well-defended city fell, and Tariq established a garrison there consisting mainly of the city&#x27;s Jews who welcomed the invaders, having been subjected to conversion from the Visigoths for centuries. Tariq then continued on his way to Toledo.

Musa, learning of Tariq&#x27;s successes, landed in Iberia with an army of 18,000 Berbers and Arabs. He planned to rendezvous with Tariq at Toledo, but first proceeded to take Seville, which Tariq had bypassed, and where Musa met stiff resistance, and succeeded after three months of siege. He then campaigned in the province of Lusitania, eliminating the remaining Gothic resistance there. His last destination before meeting Tariq was to subdue Mérida, capital of Lusitania. After five months of siege and inconclusive fighting, a group of Ceutans pretended to be Christian reinforcements and managed to convince the guards into opening the gates. Once inside, the &quot;reinforcements&quot;, nearly 700, overwhelmed the guards and managed to keep the gates open for the Muslims to enter the city and capture it.

After Mérida, Musa divided his forces, taking the majority with him to meet Tariq at Toledo where he would remain for winter. The remainder of his forces were led by his son &#x27;Abd al-Aziz, who would return to Seville to deal with an uprising. &#x27;Abd al-Aziz made short work of the rebellion. He then conducted several campaigns on the return journey in the territories of Lusitania. Coimbra and Santarém were captured in the spring of 714. &#x27;Abd al-Aziz then campaigned in Murcia. The Duke of Murcia, Theodemir, or Tudmir as he was called by the Muslims, surrendered to &#x27;Abd al-Aziz after several hard-fought engagements in April 713. The terms imposed on Theodemir declared that the duke would keep the citadel of Orihuela and several other settlements, including Alicante and Lorca on the Mediterranean, that his followers will not be killed, taken prisoner, forced into Islam, and that their churches will not be burned. It also demanded that Theodemir not encourage or support others to resist the Muslims, and that he and every citizen of his dominion pay an annual tax in money and other goods.

Musa finally met up with Tariq where there was an argument over the latter&#x27;s booty, which reportedly included a gold table covered with gems and other precious stones that had reputedly once belonged to Solomon. Meanwhile, Musa&#x27;s messenger, Mughith al-Rumi (the Roman) who had been sent to Caliph al-Walid I to inform him of the situation in Hispania, had returned. The Caliph requested Musa to withdraw and to report in person to Damascus. Musa chose to ignore this order temporarily, knowing that if he did not continue his advance, Visigoth resistance may increase and turn the tables against the Muslims. Having done so, he continued with Tariq to the north; Musa heading for Zaragoza, to which he lay siege, while Tariq continued to the provinces of León and Castile, capturing the towns of León and Astorga. Musa continued after taking Zaragoza to the north, taking Oviedo and reaching as far as the Bay of Biscay. The Islamic conquest of Iberia now complete, Musa proceeded to place governors and prefects throughout the newly conquered Al-Andalus, before returning to Damascus with most of the booty captured from the Jihad.

==Return to Damascus==
Both conquerors of Spain were therefore summoned by the caliph to Damascus. Tariq arrived first, according to some accounts. But then the caliph was taken ill. So the caliph&#x27;s brother, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik became temporarily in charge, and asked Musa, who was arriving with a cavalcade of soldiers and spoils, to delay his grand entry into the city. He most certainly intended to claim the glories brought from the conquest for himself. But Musa dismissed this request, triumphantly entered Damascus anyway, and brought the booty before the ailing Al-Walid I, which brought Musa and Tariq unprecedented popularity amongst the people of Damascus. Al-Walid I then died a few days later and was succeeded by his brother Sulayman, who demanded that Musa deliver up all his spoils. When Musa complained, Sulayman stripped him of his rank and confiscated all the booty, including the table which had reputedly once belonged to Solomon.

One of Musa&#x27;s sons, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, married Egilona who was wife of Roderic. She asked &#x27;Abd al-Aziz why his guests did not bow to him as they used to do in the presence of his father. It was reported that he began to force guests to bow to him. It was rumoured that he had secretly become a Christian, and a group of Arabs assassinated him, cut off his head and sent it to the caliph. Sulayman had Musa in his audience when the head arrived, and seeing whose it was, callously asked Musa if he recognized it. Musa maintained his dignity, saying he recognized it as belonging to someone who had always practiced the faith fervently, and cursed the men who had killed him. Another son, Abd Allah, who had acted as governor of Ifriqiya after Musa, was executed on the orders of the caliph on suspicion of having had killed the man who had replaced him.

==Death==
Musa died naturally while on the Hajj pilgrimage with Sulayman in about the year 715–716. Because of his disgrace, and the misfortunes of his sons, there was a tendency among medieval historians of the Maghreb to attribute his deeds (the conquest of Tangiers and the Sous) to Uqba ibn Nafi.

The Moroccan peak Jebel Musa is named for Musa bin Nusayr according to the 14th-century Berber Muslim geographer Ibn Battuta.

Al-Bakri in his &quot;al-Maslik wa al-Mamalik&quot;, mentions that Musa Ibn Nusayr was buried in Zaragoza.

==In legend==

Less than 200 years after his death, Musa ibn Nusayr became the subject of fantastic legends. These tales were first recorded in the late 9th or early 10th century by ibn al-Faqih, who wrote that Musa was ordered by the caliph to investigate reports of a strange city called al-Baht. Musa marched from Qayrawan to the deserts of Spain and came upon a city that was surrounded by walls with no entrance. Those who attempted to look over the wall became entranced and jumped, laughing deliriously. Musa then proceeded to a nearby lake, which contained copper jars. When opened, a genie emerged from each one.

A more extensive version of the same legend is recorded in &quot;The City of Brass,&quot; a tale in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, in which Musa encounters many other marvels, such as a palace filled with jewels, whose only human occupant was the embalmed corpse of a beautiful woman, guarded by two robot warriors.

The 17th-century historian Ibn Abi Dinar used Musa&#x27;s decline in fortune as an object lesson in the vagaries of human existence, with some exaggerations: &quot;Musa, who had conquered half the inhabited world, who had acquired so many riches, died in poverty, begging alms from passers-by, after having been abandoned by the last of his servants. Overcome by shame and misery, he wished for death, and God gave it to him. I only mention the details of Musa&#x27;s death to give my contemporaries, who are poorly read, a striking example of the vicissitudes of human life.&quot;

Probably the most extensive work to be inspired by the life of Musa is a section of the anonymous &quot;Kitāb al-imāma w&#x27;as-siyāsa&quot;, which contains a lengthy description of his deeds accompanied by many supposed speeches and sayings. Unlike many other authors, such as Ibn Abd al-Hakam, the work is entirely favourable to Musa.

<doc id="437573" wikidata="Q3246973" url="?curid=437573" title="Black-eyed pea">
<text>The black-eyed pea or black-eyed bean is a legume grown around the world for its medium-sized, edible bean. It is a subspecies of the cowpea, an Old World plant domesticated in Africa, and is sometimes simply called a cowpea.

The common commercial variety is called the California Blackeye; it is pale-colored with a prominent black spot. The American South has countless varieties, many of them heirloom, that vary in size from the small lady peas to very large ones. The color of the eye may be black, brown, red, pink, or green. All the peas are green when freshly shelled and brown or buff when dried. A popular variation of the black-eyed pea is the purple hull pea or mud-in-your-eye pea; it is usually green with a prominent purple or pink spot. The currently accepted botanical name for the black-eyed pea is &quot;Vigna unguiculata&quot; subsp. &quot;unguiculata&quot;, although previously it was classified in the genus &quot;Phaseolus&quot;. &quot;Vigna unguiculata&quot; subsp. &quot;dekindtiana&quot; is the wild relative and &quot;Vigna unguiculata&quot; subsp. &quot;sesquipedalis&quot; is the related asparagus bean. Other beans of somewhat similar appearance, such as the (goat&#x27;s-eye bean) of northern Mexico, are sometimes incorrectly called black-eyed peas, and vice versa.

==History==
The black-eyed pea originates from West Africa and has been cultivated in China and India since prehistoric times. It was grown in Virginia since the 17th century by African slaves who were brought to America along with the indigenous plants from their homelands. The crop would also eventually prove popular in Texas. The planting of crops of black-eyed peas was promoted by George Washington Carver because, as a legume, it adds nitrogen to the soil and has high nutritional value. Throughout the South, the black-eyed pea is still a widely used ingredient today in soul food and cuisines of the Southern United States. The black-eye pea is cultivated throughout the world.

==Cultivation==
In non-tropical climates, this heat-loving crop should be sown after all danger of frost has passed and the soil is warm. Seeds sown too early will rot before germination. Black-eyed peas are extremely drought tolerant, so excessive watering should be avoided.

The crop is relatively free of pests and disease. Root-knot nematodes can be a problem, especially if crops are not rotated. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, fertilization can exclude nitrogen three weeks after germination.

The blossom produces nectar plentifully, and large areas can be a source of honey. Because the bloom attracts a variety of pollinators, care must be taken in the application of insecticides to avoid label violations.

After planting the pea, it should start to grow after 2–5 days.

==Lucky New Year food==
In the Southern United States, eating black-eyed peas or Hoppin&#x27; John (a traditional soul food) on New Year&#x27;s Day is thought to bring prosperity in the new year. The peas are typically cooked with a pork product for flavoring (such as bacon, fatback, ham bones, or hog jowls) and diced onion, and served with a hot chili sauce or a pepper-flavored vinegar. The traditional meal also includes cabbage, collard, turnip, or mustard greens, and ham. The peas, since they swell when cooked, symbolize prosperity; the greens symbolize money; the pork, because pigs root forward when foraging, represents positive motion. Cornbread, which represents gold, also often accompanies this meal.

Several legends exist as to the origin of this custom. Two popular explanations for the South&#x27;s association with peas and good luck date back to the American Civil War. The first is associated with General William T. Sherman&#x27;s march of the Union Army to the sea, during which they pillaged the Confederates&#x27; food supplies. Stories say peas and salted pork were said to have been left untouched, because of the belief that they were animal food unfit for human consumption. Southerners considered themselves lucky to be left with some supplies to help them survive the winter, and black-eyed peas evolved into a representation of good luck. One challenge to this legend is that General Sherman brought backup supplies with him including three days of animal feed and would have been unlikely to have left even animal feed untouched. In addition, the dates of the first average frost for Atlanta and Savannah, respectively, are November 13 and November 28. As Sherman&#x27;s march was from November 15 to December 21, 1864, it is improbable, although possible, that the Union Army would have come across standing fields of black-eyed peas as relayed in most versions of the legend. In another Southern tradition, black-eyed peas were a symbol of emancipation for African-Americans who had previously been enslaved, and who after the Civil War were officially freed on New Year&#x27;s Day.

Other Southern American traditions point to Jews of Ashkenazi and Sephardic ancestry in Southern cities and plantations eating the peas.

<text>Jonathan Peter Wilkinson, (born 25 May 1979) is an English former rugby union player. A fly-half, he played for Newcastle Falcons and French side Toulon and represented England and the British &amp; Irish Lions. He is particularly known for scoring the winning drop goal in the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final and is widely acknowledged as one of the best rugby union players of all time.

He played club rugby for twelve seasons in the English Premiership with Newcastle Falcons. In 2009, he moved to Toulon, where he won two Heineken Cups and one Top 14 championship in five seasons. He holds the record of top point-scorer at both clubs.

Wilkinson won 91 caps for England. He was an integral member of the England squad which won the 2003 World Cup, scoring the winning drop goal in the last minute of extra time against Australia in the final. He came back from several injuries and was part of the England team which reached the final of the 2007 World Cup. He toured twice with the British &amp; Irish Lions, in 2001 to Australia and 2005 to New Zealand, winning 6 caps.

He retired from rugby at the end of the 2013–14 season. In 2016, he was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame. Wilkinson is currently a studio pundit for ITV Sport, working on their coverage of the Six Nations Championship, Rugby World Cup and other rugby events.

==Early life==
Wilkinson was born on 25 May 1979 at Frimley Park Hospital in Frimley, Surrey and grew up in Farnham. He attended Pierrepont School, Frensham and Lord Wandsworth College near Hook, Hampshire, and played at youth level for Farnham Rugby Club.

He gained a place at the University of Durham, but gave his place up in 1997 to become a professional rugby union player with the Newcastle Falcons.

==Career==
===1998–2000===
Wilkinson started his career at Newcastle School of Rugby as an inside centre, competing for a place with international veterans such as Inga Tuigamala, and Lion Alan Tait. He became a fixture in a side that went on to win the 1997-98 Allied Dunbar Premiership title. By March 1998 he was in the full England Test squad. Wilkinson began his international career as an unused replacement against Scotland, before coming off the bench, replacing Mike Catt, to play on the wing against Ireland at Twickenham on 4 April 1998; he was only 18.

He then participated in England&#x27;s &quot;Tour of Hell&quot; in June 1998 that saw them suffer heavy defeats to both New Zealand and Australia (who defeated them 76–0). Wilkinson returned to domestic duties by taking over from Rob Andrew, who was made Falcons head coach (later Director of Rugby), as both their fly-half and goal kicker. Wilkinson became a fixture in the England team, and started in all their matches in the 1999 Five Nations Championship. He played for the Falcons in their 1999 Tetley&#x27;s Bitter Cup final defeat to London Wasps.

Wilkinson played for England in matches against Australia, the United States and Canada as the 1999 Rugby World Cup approached. He made his Rugby World Cup debut against Italy, scoring one try, converting another six and landing five penalty goals to rack up 32 individual points in the 67–7 win. After playing another pool game against the All Blacks, which England lost 30–16, he was rested against Tonga, a match won by England 101–10. Following the quarter-final playoff win against Fiji, Wilkinson was relegated to the bench for the quarter-final against South Africa. England lost the match by 44–21 and exited the tournament. Clive Woodward refused to expand on his selection choice at the time, and following the match some commentators blamed the head coach&#x27;s lack of consistency in team selection as harming England&#x27;s World Cup bid.

The following year Wilkinson played in all five of England&#x27;s 2000 Six Nations Championship matches. England won the championship, however they missed a Grand Slam after losing their final match against Scotland. Wilkinson then toured South Africa with England in June 2000, kicking all of the points in their 27–22 win in Bloemfontein. He was then capped another three times for England during the end of year internationals.

===2001–2002===
In 2001, England again won the Six Nations Championship. After the opening win over Wales, Wilkinson set an individual Six Nations Championship points scoring record with 35 points against Italy at Twickenham on 17 February, to overtake the record of his Newcastle Falcons mentor, Rob Andrew. England won all their subsequent matches during the tournament, with the exception of the Irish match, which was postponed until October.

More success followed for Wilkinson after the Six Nations, as the Falcons won the Powergen Cup: a late Newcastle try saw them defeat Harlequins by three points, by 30–27. As a result of Neil Jenkins suffering a number of injuries and a dip in form, Wilkinson was picked as the first choice fly-half and goal kicker for the 2001 British Lions tour to Australia in July. The Lions won the first test over Australia by 29–13 in Brisbane, in which Wilkinson scored nine points through his kicking.

The second test, on 7 July, saw the Lions lose 35–14 at the Docklands Stadium. Wilkinson was blamed by many for throwing a long pass inside his 22 that was intercepted by Joe Roff: this was seen as the turning point in the match, and probably the test series. During the match, Wilkinson injured his leg and was stretchered off the pitch. The injury was thought to be particularly serious, but he made a full recovery before the Third and final test on 14 July. Wilkinson&#x27;s try at the start of the second half ensured that, along with his kicking scores, he equalled the Lions&#x27; best individual scoring total in a Test, with 18 points.

The incomplete 2001 Six Nations Championship was concluded in October, with England playing Ireland. England lost 20–14 at Lansdowne Road. Both Ireland and England had won four out of the five Six Nations fixtures, but England&#x27;s superior points difference ensured they clinched the title although, for the second year running, not the Grand Slam. In a match against Australia for the Cook Cup in November, Wilkinson scored all of England&#x27;s points in their 21–15 victory at Twickenham. After being rested as an unused bench replacement in the subsequent match against Romania, he then played a large role in a win over the Springboks, in which he kicked seven penalty goals in the 29–9 victory. Going for a third Six Nations title in a row, England got off to a good start in their 2002 Six Nations Championship with wins over Scotland and Ireland, before losing to France at the Stade de France. England won their remaining fixtures against Wales and Italy but France went on to complete a Grand Slam. The Falcons were in Pool 6 in the 2001–02 Heineken Cup, and won one match, finishing fourth in the pool.

In the November 2002 end-of-year tests England faced Australia, New Zealand and South Africa in subsequent weekends. Wilkinson played a large role in England&#x27;s win over the All Blacks. He scored a try (although he commented later that the chip he kicked over the New Zealand defence was in fact meant for Jason Robinson to receive), and kicked two conversions and three penalty goals, as well as a drop goal. England then faced the 2002 Tri Nations Series champions Australia, who came to Twickenham on the back of a loss to Ireland. Two tries by winger Ben Cohen and Wilkinson&#x27;s kicking accuracy saw England come back from a 19–31 deficit to defeat Australia by a single point in a 32–31 victory. England went into the last test against South Africa with the possibility of beating the Big Three rugby nations of the Southern Hemisphere on subsequent weekends, and defeated the Springboks by 53–3. Springbok Jannes Labuschagne was red-carded after 23 minutes for a late tackle on Wilkinson. The very physical match later saw Wilkinson leave the pitch with a dislocated left shoulder. The England camp believed that Wilkinson was targeted by South Africa during the game. His half-back partner Matt Dawson, who had also been forced off that match with an injury after being rammed by a Springbok player, later wrote in his autobiography &quot;Nine Lives&quot; that he felt South Africa had started out the match with the intent of injuring England players.

===2003 Six Nations and victory at the World Cup===
The opening match of the 2003 Six Nations Championship saw France, the reigning champions and Grand Slam winners, play England. Both teams were high in confidence, following successes in their end of year tests against nations from the Southern hemisphere. Many saw this game as the tournament decider and England won the match 25–17. Now considered favourites to win the tournament, as well as a Grand Slam, England defeated Wales, Italy and Scotland. For the game against Italy, Wilkinson was chosen as the captain of the squad for the first time in his England career, as Martin Johnson was unavailable due to the birth of his first child. The final match was against Ireland at Lansdowne Road and would determine the tournament, and Grand Slam winner of 2003. By winning 42–6, England became the 2003 champions and serious contenders for the upcoming 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. Wilkinson was named Man of the Match.

After the Six Nations, England commenced a tour to the Southern Hemisphere, to play New Zealand and Australia in June. On 14 June and in difficult weather conditions, Wilkinson scored all 15 points as England beat New Zealand 15–13 in Wellington. He was also a major force in their 25–14 win over Australia a week later, which was their first ever victory on Australian soil. With England&#x27;s 45–14 win over France in September, in which Wilkinson scored 18 points, England were now considered one of the favourites at the World Cup, set to start in October. Wilkinson was the youngest member of England&#x27;s World Cup squad.

England&#x27;s first match at the 2003 World Cup was at Subiaco Oval in Perth, where they defeated Georgia 84–6, with Wilkinson scoring 16 points from his goal kicking. He played a major role in the pool match against the Springboks, in which he scored 20 of England&#x27;s 25 points, in the victory which held their opponents to just six. The subsequent match against Samoa in Melbourne was surprisingly close for the number-one-ranked rugby nation against a supposed &quot;minnow&quot; of international competition, but England pulled off a 35–22 win. Wilkinson was rested for England&#x27;s final win against Uruguay. England finished at the top of Pool D, four points ahead of South Africa.

England moved into the quarter finals, where they met Wales at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. Aided by the arrival of Catt at half-time, Wilkinson went on to score 23 points in the match, which England won 28–17 to proceed to the semi-finals. England met France, whom they had beaten earlier that year on two occasions. England won 24–7, with Wilkinson scoring all of England&#x27;s points through his kicking. In the final versus Australia, with the scores level at 17–17, Wilkinson received a pass and kicked a drop goal in extra time with just 26 seconds remaining; England won 20–17. The last time Australia had lost a World Cup match was eight years earlier in the 1995 Rugby World Cup, when Wilkinson&#x27;s mentor Rob Andrew scored a drop goal at the stroke of full-time to win the game for England. After the match, Wilkinson expressed his relief at converting the winning drop goal, as it was his first success in four attempts during the match. The win gave England its first Rugby World Cup, and broke the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s dominance of the tournament. Wilkinson became the tournament&#x27;s leading points scorer with 113 points. He was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year and also named the 2003 IRB International Player of the Year.

===2004–2005===
Within a couple of weeks of winning the World Cup, Wilkinson was found to have had a broken facet in his shoulder and missed the 2004 Six Nations Championship and the disastrous tour of New Zealand and Australia. He was named captain of the England team on 4 October 2004, replacing Lawrence Dallaglio, who had resigned five weeks earlier. However, he was kept out of the 2004 autumn internationals by a haematoma in his upper right arm, the captaincy being taken over by Jason Robinson and then Martin Corry. In January 2005, he injured his medial knee ligament in a match against Perpignan. He missed the opening matches of the 2005 Six Nations Championship and on his return to Newcastle on 13 March 2005 he injured the same knee again.

In almost 18 months, he had played a total of only 937.5 minutes of competitive rugby union, but was nonetheless given a chance to prove his fitness for the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. Initially Wilkinson was left out of the 44-strong squad which was announced by Clive Woodward on 11 April 2005. However, on 8 May Woodward announced he had added the fly-half to the squad after Wilkinson had proved he was injury-free and fit. Wilkinson made his first international appearance since the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final on 23 May at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff as the Lions played Argentina. Wilkinson, along with the rest of the team, played poorly, but he kicked a conversion and six penalties and salvaged a 25–25 draw with the last kick of the game.

Wilkinson&#x27;s next international appearance was in the Lions&#x27; first test against New Zealand, starting at inside centre. Wilkinson scored the Lions&#x27; only points in their comprehensive 21–3 defeat. In the second test, another heavy loss, he started in his normal fly-half position, but suffered a stinger injury, which ruled him out of the third test. Wilkinson was replaced by Stephen Jones in the final test.

Wilkinson had to forgo participation in the Falcons&#x27; August pre-season games in Japan due to appendicitis. Then, after having appeared in five successive matches for Newcastle, the injury litany continued in late November with surgery for a sportsman&#x27;s hernia, which he himself associated with the strain of his heavy training sessions, often involving long kicking sessions.

===2006–2007===
Rob Andrew, then Director of Rugby at Falcons, said that there was no chance of Wilkinson going on England&#x27;s summer tour and that he would be taking the summer off. Despite missing two conversions, he demonstrated his playmaker skills in the game against the Worcester Warriors on 30 April, in which he played the whole second half. Afterwards, Andrew reiterated that Wilkinson should not tour during the summer to prolong his recovery period. Wilkinson started as captain in the Falcons last 2005-06 Guinness Premiership game of the season on Saturday, 6 May 2006, converting six of his team&#x27;s eight tries in their 54–19 victory over Leeds Tykes.

Rob Andrew stated in July, pre-season to the 2006-07 Guinness Premiership, that Wilkinson would be ready to challenge for an England position come the November internationals. Captaincy of the Falcons was also given to former Wallabies fullback Matt Burke, a move that Andrew believed would allow Wilkinson to concentrate more on his game and a full return to rugby. In early August head coach of England, Andy Robinson announced the Elite Player Squad for the 2006–07 season, in which Wilkinson was included.

During the second game of the 2006-07 Guinness Premiership season against Worcester Warriors on Friday, 8 September, Wilkinson was helped from the pitch after 47 minutes with a knee injury incurred when one of his team members fell on him after he was tackled. A scan confirmed that he had torn the medial ligament of his right knee. He returned to play a full 80 minutes in the 26–21 win against leaders Bristol on Friday, 3 November, kicking a conversion, a drop-goal and two penalties. It was reported on 9 November that Wilkinson suffered a lacerated kidney during the match. He returned from this injury in the Premiership game against Leicester Tigers on 27 January 2007, coming off the bench after 37 minutes. On 29 January 2007, Wilkinson was selected at fly-half in the starting line up for England in their 2007 Six Nations Championship opener against Scotland. England comprehensively beat Scotland 42–20 to regain the Calcutta Cup, Wilkinson making an impressive return, scoring 27 points with five penalties, two conversions, a drop goal, and a try. This broke the previous Calcutta Cup individual record of 24, set by Rob Andrew. Wilkinson was awarded the RBS Man of the Match as adjudicated by BBC commentator, Brian Moore.
In the following match against Italy at Twickenham, Wilkinson scored 15 points to become the highest individual point scorer in the history of the Five/Six Nations with 421 points.
Despite another injury scare just before the match against Ireland on 26 February at Croke Park, Wilkinson started, scoring 8 points in the game which England lost 43–13. Wilkinson did not play in the two remaining Six Nations games against France and Wales due to the effects of a cramp that forced him off in the Premiership 38–12 defeat to London Irish on 3 March. On 13 April, he suffered a rib injury that forced him off during his fourth consecutive appearance for Newcastle in their 19–12 win over Gloucester.

Despite missing the season&#x27;s last Premiership game against Bath, Wilkinson made the England squad for the summer tour and scored 5 points in the first test&#x27;s record 58–10 loss to South Africa. He scored 17 points in the second test, which England lost 55–22. In the first of three warm up tests before the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, Wilkinson had an impressive game, scoring 17 points (seven conversions and a penalty) in the 62–5 demolition of Wales.

===2007 World Cup===
Due to a non-contact ankle injury sustained in training, Wilkinson was not included in the teams for the opening games of the 2007 Rugby World Cup against the United States and then South Africa. He returned to score 24 points in the 44–22 win over Samoa. He helped England to victory against Tonga which put them through to the quarter-finals. During England&#x27;s 12–10 quarter final win against Australia, in which he scored all of England&#x27;s points, Wilkinson became the Rugby World Cup&#x27;s leading point scorer with 231 points, surpassing Gavin Hastings of Scotland. He continued to play a major role in England&#x27;s defence of the World Cup by kicking 9 points, including a 40-metre drop goal in the dying minutes, in their 14–9 semi-final victory over France.

In the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final, on 20 October at the Stade de France, South Africa won the Webb Ellis Cup in a game where Wilkinson kicked two penalties, but missed two drop goal attempts. He was one of only four players to start both the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cup Finals, the other three being Phil Vickery, Jason Robinson and Ben Kay.

===2008–2009 international season===

Going into the 2008 Six Nations Championship, Wilkinson was the obvious choice as England&#x27;s number 10 and started the first four matches. Against Wales on 2 February 2008, Wilkinson scored 14 points, but England put in a poor display to fall 19–26 after squandering a 10-point lead at half-time. Wilkinson then amassed 27 points in England&#x27;s next two wins against Italy and France. A disappointing loss against Scotland on 8 March, in which a number of the England squad put in poor performances, raised questions about Wilkinson&#x27;s inclusion in the starting line-up given the emerging English talents at the number 10 position. 20-year-old Danny Cipriani was the main back up stand-off throughout the tournament (along with Charlie Hodgson), and replaced Wilkinson in the starting line-up for the last match of the tournament against Ireland. This was only the second time in his England career that Wilkinson was dropped to the bench (the first time being for the 1999 Rugby World Cup quarter final match with South Africa for which Paul Grayson was preferred). However, close to the start of the second half during the Ireland match on 15 March, Wilkinson was brought off the bench to replace Toby Flood, thus playing alongside Cipriani at inside centre. This suggests a possible synthesis to the balance of nurturing up-and-coming fly-halves while incorporating the leading player in the position in recent years into the squad.

Following the Ireland match and speculation about Wilkinson&#x27;s future as the England number 10, Lawrence Dallaglio expressed his opinion that Wilkinson was unlikely to let the position be handed to Cipriani from then on: the competition for the place was likely to inspire Wilkinson, rather than discourage him.

Despite competition over his position, Wilkinson ended the 2008 Six Nations as the tournament&#x27;s top points scorer, with 50 points. He was not considered for Martin Johnson&#x27;s first England squad (the 2008 summer tour of New Zealand) due to a shoulder injury. He was joined by Danny Cipriani on the sidelines after the Wasps player also missed out due to injury. On 1 July 2008, Wilkinson was named in Martin Johnson&#x27;s Elite Player Squad and was the only specialist fly-half in the squad.

===2008-2009 Guinness Premiership season===
Wilkinson made his recovery from shoulder surgery to score 22 points on his return game against Northampton on 14 September 2008, including a 45-metre last minute drop goal. Further sparkling performances and robust play indicated Wilkinson was playing injury free and back to his best. Unfortunately, the injury jinx struck again in the Guinness Premiership fixture against Gloucester on 30 September 2008. Wilkinson was forced off the field with a dislocated knee, which left him unavailable for England&#x27;s autumn internationals and for the rest of the 2008-09 Guinness Premiership season. Wilkinson&#x27;s injury facilitated a recall to the England squad for the Autumn Internationals for Danny Cipriani, who had returned from a serious ankle injury on 1 October 2008. In May 2009, it was confirmed that Wilkinson had ended his 12 years with the Falcons to join the French team Toulon for the 2009-10 Top 14 season.

===2009 autumn internationals===
Wilkinson made a successful injury free comeback to international test rugby on 7 November against Australia after an 18-month absence. He then went on to play consecutive games against Argentina on 14 November and New Zealand on 21 November. Wilkinson along with Lewis Moody were England&#x27;s most consistent performers as they lost to Australia and New Zealand and narrowly beat Argentina. During the first two games he was partnered with Shane Geraghty at inside centre for the third game he was partnered with Ayoola Erinle at inside centre. 

===2007–2014===
Because of a succession of injuries – affecting his knee ligaments, arm, shoulder and kidney – Wilkinson&#x27;s international career was severely disrupted. He did not appear again for England until 1,169 days after the 2003 Rugby World Cup triumph, for the opening game of the 2007 Six Nations Championship against Scotland on 3 February 2007. In his comeback international match, Wilkinson scored 27 points (a record in the Calcutta Cup) in a full house (scoring points by all four possible methods), and was proclaimed Man of the Match.

The following week against Italy, he became the highest point-scorer in the history of the Five/Six Nations Championship (he has since been overtaken by Ronan O&#x27;Gara of Ireland). On 6 October 2007, he also became the highest point-scorer in the history of the Rugby World Cup, kicking four penalties to overtake Scotland&#x27;s Gavin Hastings in a quarter-final against Australia.

In a 2008 Six Nations Championship match against Italy, Wilkinson became the first English player (and third overall) to score Test points.
He is also the world record drop goal scorer in international rugby with a total of 36. In March 2008, he became the highest international point-scorer, overtaking Neil Jenkins of Wales. In September 2008 he was injured again, ending his 2008-09 Guinness Premiership season.

In July 2009 he was recalled into the England Elite Squad for the first time since the 2008 Six Nations Championship and was confirmed in the squad for the 2009 Autumn internationals after a successful run of games with Toulon. Wilkinson was then selected to tour Australia with the elite squad but was not selected as first choice fly half, nevertheless Wilkinson landed the winning points in the second test between England and Australia. Injury forced him to miss out on the 2010 autumn internationals, in the process losing his position as the all-time leading points scorer in test rugby to Dan Carter. However, Wilkinson reclaimed the record during the 2011 Six Nations Championship, a tournament during which he came off the bench in each of England&#x27;s five games. He again lost the record to Carter in July 2011. On 12 December 2011, he announced his retirement from Test Rugby.

===Toulon===
In May 2009 Wilkinson agreed to join French club Toulon on a two-year contract, leaving Newcastle after 12 years.

In April 2013 Wilkinson played the full 80 minutes in Toulon&#x27;s Heineken Cup Quarter-Final, scoring all 21 points against Leicester Tigers. Wilkinson then landed 7 penalties and a drop goal to defeat Owen Farrell&#x27;s Saracens.
In May 2013 he scored 11 points as Toulon won the 2013 Heineken Cup Final by 16–15 against Clermont Auvergne. Wilkinson finished as the ERC European Player of the Year for the 2013 tournament, having not missed a single place kick in the knockouts with 17 from 17 attempts and finished with 56 points in the knockouts alone and 108 points in the entire tournament.

On 24 May 2014, he led Toulon to a decisive 23–6 win against Saracens in the 2014 Heineken Cup Final. He scored 13 points in the game. One week later on 31 May 2014, he led Toulon once again to another win in a final, this time the Top 14 Final against Castres in which Toulon won 18–10. Wilkinson kicked 15 points. This was the last match of his career. After the final whistle, supporters from both clubs sang &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; in tribute to him.

Wikinson&#x27;s contribution to Toulon&#x27;s success, as well as his historic strengths, increased experience and very high kicking success rate, included his leadership role within a superstar and multi-cultural team; 
*&quot;One of the reasons the team is so successful is because it’s driven by him. He’s the leader and he puts in more work than anyone but he’s incredibly humble. It’s a team full of superstars but they can’t let their egos get the better of them because Jonny’s in charge. He’s the most famous and the most talented but also the most grounded. In his team talks he speaks first in perfect French and then repeats it in English.&quot; 
Wilkinson was the highest paid player in French rugby.

===Retirement===
In May 2014, Wilkinson announced that he would retire from all rugby at the end of the season.

==International records==
England won 67 of the 91 games Wilkinson played in. Wilkinson scored a record 29th Test drop goal against France in the 2008 Six Nations Championship. His first converted penalty against Scotland on 8 March 2008, took him 3 points past Wales&#x27;s Neil Jenkins tally of 1090 Test rugby points. This achievement came due to the IRB (now known as World Rugby) retroactively granting full Test status to the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions warm-up test against Argentina, in which he scored 20 points, without which he would have remained behind Jenkins on that day. Two more penalties in the second half took his tally to 1099 points.

On 26 February 2011, Wilkinson regained the record for the highest tally of International points, overtaking Dan Carter of New Zealand by scoring a penalty against France in a Six Nations match at Twickenham. Carter then reclaimed the record on 30 July 2011 in the second 2011 Tri Nations Series match against South Africa. Wilkinson passed Ronan O&#x27;Gara (522) to regain the overall points record total of 526 in the 2010 Six Nations Championship, on 13 March 2010. Wilkinson holds the Rugby World Cup points record with 277 and is the only player to score points in two Rugby World Cup Finals.

As of 2015, Wilkinson had made more tackles in world cups than any other back.

==Honours==
In 2002, Wilkinson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). In the 2004 New Year Honours, he was promoted to Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). In the 2015 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) &#x27;for services to Rugby Union&#x27;.

On 3 April 2009 at Guildford Cathedral, Wilkinson was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Surrey for services to the sports industry. Wilkinson announced his retirement from the English national squad in early December 2011.

On 17 November 2016, he was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame at the opening ceremony for the Hall&#x27;s first physical location in Rugby, Warwickshire.

==Media==
Wilkinson wrote a column for &quot;The Times&quot; occasionally until 2011, often during periods of high media focus on rugby, such as Six Nations tournaments and Rugby World Cups. He has also written five books, which have been published by Headline. The first, &quot;Lions and Falcons: My Diary of a Remarkable Year&quot;, written with ghostwriter Neil Squires who also helped Wilkinson in a few other books, was published in 2001, and followed a turbulent rugby year for him. The diary documented the England rugby players&#x27; strike, the Newcastle Falcons winning the Powergen Cup, the 2001 Six Nations Championship and the British &amp; Irish Lions tour at the end of the year. After helping England win the Rugby World Cup with his last-ditch effort in 2003, he published his second book in 2004. The book, &quot;My World&quot;, was largely picture-based, with less text than in his previous book. The book focused on his experience of the 2003 World Cup, and how his life had altered following the winning drop goal.

In 2005 &quot;How to Play Rugby My Way&quot;, which accompanied the BBC series &quot;Jonny&#x27;s Hotshots&quot;, was published. It was largely a coaching/instruction manual, with tips and techniques for rugby playing. It also included small insights into Wilkinson&#x27;s family life and the relationships which have allowed his rugby playing to flourish. Wilkinson&#x27;s next book, &quot;Tackling Life&quot;, was published in 2008. This book focuses on how his attitude to life changed after his injury woes, and how he overcame them. His fifth book, &quot;Jonny: My Autobiography&quot;, was published in 2011.

Since his retirement from playing, Wilkinson has appeared as a studio pundit for Sky Sports and ITV Sport, working on coverage of the Champions Cup, Six Nations Championship, Rugby World Cup and England Internationals.

==Coaches and mentors==
Steve Black, the Newcastle Falcons&#x27; fitness trainer, was particularly influential on Wilkinson&#x27;s rugby career. Wilkinson has previously stated that he respects Black a great deal, and that Black taught him a lot about &quot;values and ethics&quot;.

Wilkinson also worked with kicking coach Dave Alred.

==Mental conditioning==
Wilkinson has been open about managing the stresses he felt during his playing career.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Wilkinson&#x27;s older brother, Mark, was also a Newcastle player who made 16 appearances in the Premiership for the side between 2002 and 2005, predominantly as a centre. His father, Phil, was a rugby player and cricketer, and his mother, Philippa, played squash at county level.
===Marriage===
On 28 October 2013, Wilkinson married his girlfriend of eight years, scaffolding company heiress Shelley Jenkins, in a private ceremony at the town hall of the French resort of Bandol, to the west of Toulon. Only two guests, one of them Wilkinson&#x27;s mother, were present at the ceremony officiated by Bandol mayor Christian Palix, who said that &quot;both [are] viewed with great respect&quot; in the community.

===Fineside===
In September 2011, Wilkinson launched Fineside, an online men&#x27;s fashion label.

===No.1 Living===
In 2018, Wilkinson founded kombucha company, No.1 Living, after brewing kombucha with his wife at home and discovering the benefits of a &quot;living diet&quot;.

===Attitudes and philosophy===
Wilkinson followed Buddhist principles and teachings to help control his perfectionist tendencies, according to an interview he gave with &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in 2009.

Wilkinson seeks to live consciously rather than reactively, and to embrace all the positive aspects of humanity such as acceptance, compassion and a true connection with others.

===Diet===
Wilkinson is widely known as a teetotaller, but broke that habit after England lost to South Africa in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final. Wilkinson seeks to eat natural foods, avoiding toxins.

==Awards==
In December 2005, Wilkinson was awarded an honorary doctorate in Civil Law by Northumbria University.

He was the 2003 BBC Sports Personality of the Year, the 2003 International Rugby Board (IRB) International Player of the Year and the 2013 (ERC) European Player of the Year.

<doc id="437585" wikidata="Q181260" url="?curid=437585" title="Epigraphy">
<text>Epigraphy () is the study of inscriptions, or epigraphs, as writing; it is the science of identifying graphemes, clarifying their meanings, classifying their uses according to dates and cultural contexts, and drawing conclusions about the writing and the writers. Specifically excluded from epigraphy are the historical significance of an epigraph as a document and the artistic value of a literary composition. A person using the methods of epigraphy is called an &quot;epigrapher&quot; or &quot;epigraphist&quot;. For example, the Behistun inscription is an official document of the Achaemenid Empire engraved on native rock at a location in Iran. Epigraphists are responsible for reconstructing, translating, and dating the trilingual inscription and finding any relevant circumstances. It is the work of historians, however, to determine and interpret the events recorded by the inscription as document. Often, epigraphy and history are competences practised by the same person. Epigraphy is a primary tool of archaeology when dealing with literate cultures. The US Library of Congress classifies epigraphy as one of the auxiliary sciences of history. Epigraphy also helps identify a forgery: epigraphic evidence formed part of the discussion concerning the James Ossuary.

An epigraph (not to be confused with epigram) is any sort of text, from a single grapheme (such as marks on a pot that abbreviate the name of the merchant who shipped commodities in the pot) to a lengthy document (such as a treatise, a work of literature, or a hagiographic inscription). Epigraphy overlaps other competences such as numismatics or palaeography. When compared to books, most inscriptions are short. The media and the forms of the graphemes are diverse: engravings in stone or metal, scratches on rock, impressions in wax, embossing on cast metal, cameo or intaglio on precious stones, painting on ceramic or in fresco. Typically the material is durable, but the durability might be an accident of circumstance, such as the baking of a clay tablet in a conflagration.

The character of the writing, the subject of epigraphy, is a matter quite separate from the nature of the text, which is studied in itself. Texts inscribed in stone are usually for public view and so they are essentially different from the written texts of each culture. Not all inscribed texts are public, however: in Mycenaean Greece the deciphered texts of &quot;Linear B&quot; were revealed to be largely used for economic and administrative record keeping. Informal inscribed texts are &quot;graffiti&quot; in its original sense.

The study of ideographic inscriptions, that is inscriptions representing an idea or concept, may also be called ideography. The German equivalent &quot;Sinnbildforschung&quot; was a scientific discipline in the Third Reich, but was later dismissed as being highly ideological. Epigraphic research overlaps with the study of petroglyphs, which deals with specimens of pictographic, ideographic and logographic writing. The study of ancient handwriting, usually in ink, is a separate field, palaeography. Epigraphy also differs from iconography, as it confines itself to meaningful symbols containing messages, rather than dealing with images.

==History==

The science of epigraphy has been developing steadily since the 16th century. Principles of epigraphy vary culture by culture, and the infant science in Europe initially concentrated on Latin inscriptions. Individual contributions have been made by epigraphers such as Georg Fabricius (1516–1571); Stefano Antonio Morcelli (1737–1822); Luigi Gaetano Marini (1742–1815); August Wilhelm Zumpt (1815–1877); Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903); Emil Hübner (1834–1901); Franz Cumont (1868–1947); Louis Robert (1904–1985).

The , begun by Mommsen and other scholars, has been published in Berlin since 1863, with wartime interruptions. It is the largest and most extensive collection of Latin inscriptions. New fascicles are still produced as the recovery of inscriptions continues. The is arranged geographically: all inscriptions from Rome are contained in volume 6. This volume has the greatest number of inscriptions; volume 6, part 8, fascicle 3 was just recently published (2000). Specialists depend on such on-going series of volumes in which newly discovered inscriptions are published, often in Latin, not unlike the biologists&#x27; &quot;Zoological Record&quot; – the raw material of history.

Greek epigraphy has unfolded in the hands of a different team, with different corpora. There are two. The first is of which four volumes came out, again at Berlin, 1825–1877. This marked a first attempt at a comprehensive publication of Greek inscriptions copied from all over the Greek-speaking world. Only advanced students still consult it, for better editions of the texts have superseded it. The second, modern corpus is arranged geographically under categories: decrees, catalogues, honorary titles, funeral inscriptions, various, all presented in Latin, to preserve the international neutrality of the field of classics.

Other such series include the (Etruscan inscriptions), (Crusaders&#x27; inscriptions), (Celtic inscriptions), (Iranian inscriptions), &quot;Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia&quot; and &quot;Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period&quot; (Sumerian and Akkadian inscriptions) and so forth.

Egyptian hieroglyphs were solved using the Rosetta Stone, which was a multilingual stele in Classical Greek, Demotic Egyptian and Classical Egyptian hieroglyphs. The work was done by the French scholar, Jean-François Champollion, and the British scientist Thomas Young.

The interpretation of Maya hieroglyphs was lost as a result of the Spanish Conquest of Central America. However, recent work by Maya epigraphers and linguists has yielded a considerable amount of information on this complex writing system.

====Codes of law and regulations====
Ancient writers state that the earliest laws of Athens were inscribed upon tablets of wood, put together in a pyramidal shape. These, owing to their material, have perished; but we have some very early codes of law preserved on stone, notably at Gortyna in Crete. Here an inscription of great length is incised on the slabs of a theatre-shaped structure in 12 columns of 50 lines each; it is mainly concerned with the law of inheritance, adoption, etc. Doubtless similar inscriptions were set up in many places in Greece. An interesting series of inscriptions deals with the conditions under which colonists were sent out from various cities, and the measures that were taken to secure their rights as citizens. A bronze tablet records in some detail the arrangements of this sort made when Locrians established a colony in Naupactus; another inscription relates to the Athenian colonisation of Salamis, in the 6th century BC.

====Decrees of people and rulers, later of kings and emperors====
A very large number of inscriptions are in the form of decrees of various cities and peoples, even when their subject matter suggests that they should be classified under other headings. Almost all legislative and many administrative measures take this form; often a decree prescribes how and where the inscription should be set up. The formulae and preambles of such decrees vary considerably from place to place, and from period to period. Those of Athens are by far the most exactly known, owing to the immense number that have been discovered; and they are so strictly stereotyped that can be classified with the precision of algebraic formulae, and often dated to within a few years by this test alone. Very full lists for this purpose have been drawn up by epigraphist Wilhelm Larfeld, in his work on the subject. It is usual to record the year (by the name of the eponymous archon), the day of the month and of the prytany (or presiding commission according to tribes), various secretaries, the presiding officials and the proposer of the decree. It is also stated whether the resolution is passed by the senate (Boule) or the assembly of the people (Ecclesia), or both. The circumstances or the reason of the resolution are then given, and finally the decision itself. Some other cities followed Athens in the form of their decrees, with such local variations as were required; others were more independent in their development, and different magistracies or forms of government had various results. In the Hellenistic Age, and later, the forms of independent government were, to a great extent, kept up, though little real power remained with the people. On the other hand, it is common thing to find letters from kings, and later from Roman emperors, inscribed and set up in public places.

====Public accounts, treasure lists, building inscriptions====
It was customary to inscribe on stone all records of the receipt, custody and expenditure of public money or treasure, so that citizens could verify for themselves the safety and due control of the State in all financial matters. As in the case of temple accounts, it was usual for each temporary board of officials to render to their successors an account of their stewardship, and of the resources and treasures which they handed over. In all cases of public works, the expenditure was ordered by the State, and detailed reports were drawn up and inscribed on stone at intervals while the work was being carried out. In many cases there is a detailed specification of building work which makes it possible, not only to realise all the technical details and processes employed, but also the whole plan and structure of a building. A notable instance is the arsenal of Philon at the Peiraeus which has been completely reconstructed on paper by architects from the building specification. In the case of the Erechtheum, we have not only a detailed report on the unfinished state of the building in 409 BC, but also accounts of the expenditure and payments to the workmen employed in finishing it. Similar accounts have been preserved of the building of the Parthenon, spread over 15 years; in the case of both the Parthenon and the Erechtheum, there are included the payments made to those who made the sculptures.

Naval and military expenditure is also fully accounted for; among other information there are records of the galley-slips at the different harbours of the Piraeus, and of the ships of the Athenian navy, with their names and condition. In short, there is no department of state economy and financial administration that is not abundantly illustrated by the record of inscriptions. A set of records of high historical value are the &quot;tribute lists&quot;, recording the quota paid to Athens by her subject allies during the 5th century BC. These throw much light on her relations with them at various periods.(Cf. Delian League).

====Ephebic inscriptions====
An institution as to which our knowledge is mainly derived from inscriptions is the ephebic system at Athens. There are not only records of lists of ephebi and of their guardians and instructors, but also decrees in honour of their services, especially in taking their due part in religious and other ceremonies, and resolutions of the ephebi themselves in honour of their officials. It is possible to trace in the inscriptions, which range over several centuries, how what was originally a system of physical and military training for Athenian youths from age of 18 to 20, with outpost and police duties, was gradually transformed. In later times there were added to the instructors in military exercises others who gave lectures on what we should now call arts and science subjects; so that in the Hellenistic and Roman times, when youths from all parts of the civilised world flocked to Athens as an intellectual centre, the ephebic system became a kind of cosmopolitan university.

====Treaties and political and commercial agreements; arbitration, etc.====
In addition to inscriptions which are concerned with the internal affairs of various cities, there are many others recording treaties or other agreements of an international character between various cities and states. These were incised on bronze or stone, and set up in places of public resort in the cities concerned, or in common religious centres such as Olympia and Delphi. The simplest form of treaty is merely an alliance for a certain term of years, usually with some penalty for any breach of the conditions. Often an oath was prescribed, to be taken by representatives on each side; it was also not unusual to appeal to the god in whose temple the treaty was exhibited. In other cases a list of gods by whom the two parties must swear is prescribed. Commercial clauses were sometimes added to treaties of alliance, and commercial treaties are also found, agreeing as to the export and import of merchandise and other things. In later days, especially in the time of the Hellenistic kings, treaties tend to become more complicated and detailed in their provisions.

Another series of records of great historical interest is concerned with arbitration between various states on various questions, mainly concerned with frontiers. In cases of dispute it was not uncommon for the two disputants to appoint a third party as arbitrator. Sometimes this third party was another State, sometimes a specified number of individuals. Thus, in a frontier dispute between Corinth and Epidaurus, 151 citizens of Megara were appointed by name to arbitrate, and when the decision was disputed, 31 from among them revised and confirmed it. In all such cases it was the custom for a full record to be preserved on stone and set up in the places concerned. In this case the initiative in referring the matter to arbitration came from the Achaean League.

====Proxenia decrees====
A very large class of inscriptions deals with the institution of &quot;proxenia&quot;. According to this a citizen of any State might be appointed &quot;proxenos&quot; of another State; his duties would then be to offer help and hospitality to any citizen of that other State who might be visiting his city, and to assist him in any dispute or in securing his legal rights. The office has been compared to the modern appointment of consuls, with the essential difference that the &quot;proxenos&quot; is always a citizen of the state in which he resides, not of that whose citizens and interests he assists. The decrees upon this matter frequently record the appointment of a &quot;proxenos&quot;, and the conferring on him of certain benefits and privileges in return for his services; they also contain resolutions of thanks from the city served by the &quot;proxenos&quot;, and record honours consequently conferred upon him.

====Honours and privileges given to individuals====
This class of inscription is in form not unlike the last, except that honours recorded are given for all sorts of services, private and public, to the State and to individuals. A frequent addition is an invitation to dine in the Prytaneum at Athens. Some are inscribed on the bases of statues set up to the recipient. In early times these inscriptions are usually brief and simple. The bust of Pericles on the Acropolis held nothing but the names of Pericles himself and of the sculptor Kresilas. Later it became usual to give, in some detail, the reasons for the honours awarded; and in Hellenistic and Roman times, these became more and more detailed and fulsome in laudatory detail.

====Signatures of artists====
These inscriptions are of special interest as throwing much light upon the history of art. The artist&#x27;s name was usually, especially in earlier times, carved upon the base of the pedestal of a statue, and consequently was easily separated from it if the statue was carried off or destroyed. A case where both statue and pedestal are preserved is offered by the &quot;Victory&quot;, signed on its pedestal by Paeonius at Olympia. Occasionally, and more frequently in later times, the artist&#x27;s signature was carved upon some portion of the statue itself. But in later copies of well-known works, it has to be considered whether the name is that of the original artist or of the copyist who reproduced his work. (see for example, the statue of Hercules/Heracles below)

A special class of artists&#x27; signatures is offered by the names signed by Attic and other vase painters upon their vases. These have been made the basis of a minute historical and stylistic study of the work of these painters, and unsigned vases also have been grouped with the signed ones, so as to make an exact and detailed record of this branch of Greek artistic production.

====Historical records====
The great majority of these fall into one of the classes already referred to. But there are some instances in which an inscription is set up merely as a record. For instance, a victor in athletic or other contests may set up a list of his victories. The most famous historical record is the autobiographical account of the deeds and administration of Augustus, which was reproduced and set up in many places; it is generally known as the Monumentum Ancyranum, because the most complete copy of it was found at Ancyra. The Marmor Parium at Oxford, found in Paros, is a chronological record of Greek history, probably made for educational purposes, and valuable as giving the traditional dates of events from the earliest time down.

====Tombs and epitaphs====
This is by far the most numerous class of inscriptions, both Greek and Latin. In early times there is often no record beyond the name of the deceased in Athens, often with the name of his father and his deme. Sometimes a word or two of conventional praise is added, such as &quot;a good and wise man&quot;. Occasionally the circumstances of death are alluded to, especially if it took place in battle or at sea. Such epitaphs were frequently in metrical form, usually either hexameter or elegiacs. Many of them have been collected, and they form an interesting addition to the Greek anthology. In later times it becomes usual to give more elaborate praise of the deceased; but this is hardly ever so detailed and fulsome as on more modern tombstones. The age and other facts about the deceased are occasionally given, but not nearly so often as on Latin tombstones, which offer valuable statistical information in this respect.

==Latin inscriptions==

Latin inscriptions may be classified on much the same lines as Greek; but certain broad distinctions may be drawn at the outset. They are generally more standardised as to form and as to content, not only in Rome and Italy, but also throughout the provinces of the Roman Empire. One of the chief difficulties in deciphering Latin Inscriptions lies in the very extensive use of initials and abbreviations. These are of great number and variety, and while some of them can be easily interpreted as belonging to well-known formulae, others offer considerable difficulty, especially to the inexperienced student. Often the same initial may have many different meanings according to the context. Some common formulae such as &#x27; (), or &#x27; () offer little difficulty, but there are many which are not so obvious and leave room for conjecture. Often the only way to determine the meaning is to search through a list of initials, such as those given by modern Latin epigraphists, until a formula is found which fits the context.

Most of what has been said about Greek inscriptions applies to Roman also. The commonest materials in this case also are stone, marble and bronze; but a more extensive use is made of stamped bricks and tiles, which are often of historical value as identifying and dating a building or other construction. The same applies to leaden water pipes which frequently bear dates and names of officials. Terracotta lamps also frequently have their makers&#x27; names and other information stamped upon them. Arms, and especially shields, sometimes bear the name and corps of their owners. Leaden discs were also used to serve the same purpose as modern identification discs. Inscriptions are also found on sling bullets – Roman as well as Greek; there are also numerous classes of &quot;tesserae&quot; or tickets of admission to theatres or other shows.

As regards the contents of inscriptions, there must evidently be a considerable difference between records of a number of independent city states and an empire including almost all the civilised world; but municipalities maintained much of their independent traditions in Roman times, and consequently their inscriptions often follow the old formulas.

The classification of Roman inscriptions may, therefore, follow the same lines as the Greek, except that certain categories are absent, and that some others, not found in Greek, are of considerable importance.

===Religious===

====Dedications and foundations of temples, etc.====
These are very numerous; and the custom of placing the name of the dedicator in a conspicuous place on the building was prevalent, especially in the case of dedications by emperors or officials, or by public bodies. Restoration or repair was often recorded in the same manner. In the case of small objects the dedication is usually simple in form; it usually contains the name of the god or other recipient and of the donor, and a common formula is &#x27; () often with additions such as &#x27; (). Such dedications are often the result of a vow, and () is therefore often added. Bequests made under the wills of rich citizens are frequently recorded by inscriptions; these might either be for religious or for social purposes.

====Priests and officials====
A priesthood was frequently a political office and consequently is mentioned along with political honours in the list of a man&#x27;s distinctions. The priesthoods that a man had held are usually mentioned first in inscriptions before his civil offices and distinctions. Religious offices, as well as civil, were restricted to certain classes, the highest to those of senatorial rank, the next to those of equestrian status; many minor offices, both in Rome and in the provinces, are enumerated in their due order.

====Regulations as to religion and cult====
Among the most interesting of these is the ancient song and accompanying dance performed by the priests known as the Arval Brothers. This is, however, not in the form of a ritual prescription, but a detailed record of the due performance of the rite. An important class of documents is the series of calendars that have been found in Rome and in the various Italian towns. These give notice of religious festivals and anniversaries, and also of the days available for various purposes.

====Colleges====
The various colleges for religious purposes were very numerous. Many of them, both in Rome and Italy, and in provincial municipalities, were of the nature of priesthoods. Some were regarded as offices of high distinction and were open only to men of senatorial rank; among these were the Augurs, the Fetiales, the Salii; also the in imperial times. The records of these colleges sometimes give no information beyond the names of members, but these are often of considerable interest. Haruspices and Luperci were of equestrian rank.

===Political and social===

====Codes of law and regulations====
Our information as to these is not mainly drawn from inscriptions and, therefore, they need not here be considered. On the other hand, the word (law) is usually applied to all decrees of the senate or other bodies, whether of legislative or of administrative character. It is therefore, best to consider all together under the heading of public decrees.

====Laws and plebiscites, senatus consulta, decrees of magistrates or later of emperors====
A certain number of these dating from republican times are of considerable interest. One of the earliest relates to the prohibition of bacchanalian orgies in Italy; it takes the form of a message from the magistrates, stating the authority on which they acted. Laws all follow a fixed formula, according to the body which has passed them. First there is a statement that the legislative body was consulted by the appropriate magistrate in due form; then follows the text of the law; and finally the sanction, the statement that the law was passed. In decrees of the senate the formula differs somewhat. They begin with a preamble giving the names of the consulting magistrates, the place and conditions of the meeting; then comes the subject submitted for decision, ending with the formula &#x27; (); then comes the decision of the senate, opening with &#x27; (). C. is added at the end, to indicate that the decree was passed. In imperial times, the emperor sometimes addressed a speech to the senate, advising them to pass certain resolutions, or else, especially in later times, gave orders or instructions directly, either on his own initiative or in response to questions or references. The number and variety of such orders is such that no classification of them can be given here. One of the most famous is the edict of Diocletian, fixing the prices of all commodities. Copies of this in Greek as well as in Latin have been found in various parts of the Roman Empire.

====Records of buildings, etc.====

A very large number of inscriptions record the construction or repair of public buildings by private individuals, by magistrates, Roman or provincial, and by emperors. In addition to the dedication of temples, we find inscriptions recording the construction of aqueducts, roads, especially on milestones, baths, basilicas, porticos and many other works of public utility. In inscriptions of early period often nothing is given but the name of the person who built or restored the edifice and a statement that he had done so. But later it was usual to give more detail as to the motive of the building, the name of the emperor or a magistrate giving the date, the authority for the building and the names and distinctions of the builders; then follows a description of the building, the source of the expenditure (e.g., , ) and finally the appropriate verb for the work done, whether building, restoring, enlarging or otherwise improving. Other details are sometimes added, such as the name of the man under whose direction the work was done.

====Military documents====
These vary greatly in content, and are among the most important documents concerning the administration of the Roman Empire. &quot;They are numerous and of all sorts – tombstones of every degree, lists of soldiers&#x27; burial clubs, certificates of discharge from service, schedules of time-expired men, dedications of altars, records of building or of engineering works accomplished. The facts directly commemorated are rarely important.&quot; But when the information from hundreds of such inscriptions is collected together, &quot;you can trace the whole policy of the Imperial Government in the matter of recruiting, to what extent and till what date legionaries were raised in Italy; what contingents for various branches of the service were drawn from the provinces, and which provinces provided most; how far provincials garrisoned their own countries, and which of them, like the British recruits, were sent as a measure of precaution to serve elsewhere; or, finally, at what epoch the empire grew weak enough to require the enlistment of barbarians from beyond its frontiers.&quot;

====Treaties and agreements====
There were many treaties between Rome and other states in republican times; but we do not, as a rule, owe our knowledge of these to inscriptions, which are very rare in this earlier period. In imperial times, to which most Latin inscriptions belong, international relations were subject to the universal domination of Rome, and consequently the documents relating to them are concerned with reference to the central authority, and often take the form of orders from the emperor.

====Proxeny====

This custom belonged to Greece. What most nearly corresponded to it in Roman times was the adoption of some distinguished Roman as its &quot;patron&quot;, by a city or state. The relation was then recorded, usually on a bronze tablet placed in some conspicuous position in the town concerned. The patron probably also kept a copy in his house, or had a portable tablet which would ensure his recognition and reception.

====Honorary====
Honorary inscriptions are extremely common in all parts of the Roman world. Sometimes they are placed on the bases of statues, sometimes in documents set up to record some particular benefaction or the construction of some public work. The offices held by the person commemorated, and the distinctions conferred upon him are enumerated in a regularly established order (), either beginning with the lower and proceeding step by step to the higher, or in reverse order with the highest first. Religious and priestly offices are usually mentioned before civil and political ones. These might be exercised either in Rome itself, or in the various municipalities of the empire. There was also a distinction drawn between offices that might be held only by persons of senatorial rank, those that were assigned to persons of equestrian rank, and those of a less distinguished kind. It follows that when only a portion of an inscription has been found, it is often possible to restore the whole in accordance with the accepted order.

====Signatures of artists====
When these are attached to statues, it is sometimes doubtful whether the name is that of the man who actually made the statue, or of the master whose work it reproduces. Thus there are two well-known copies of a statue of Hercules by Lysippus, of which one is said to be the work of Lysippus, and the other states that it was made by Glycon (see images). Another kind of artist&#x27;s or artificer&#x27;s signature that is commoner in Roman times is to be found in the signatures of potters upon lamps and various kinds of vessels; they are usually impressed on the mould and stand out in relief on the terracotta or other material. These are of interest as giving much information as to the commercial spread of various kinds of handicrafts, and also as to the conditions under which they were manufactured.

====Historical records====
Many of these inscriptions might well be assigned to one of the categories already considered. But there are some which were expressly made to commemorate an important event, or to preserve a record. Among the most interesting is the inscription of the in Rome, which records the great naval victory of Gaius Duilius over the Carthaginians; this, however, is not the original, but a later and somewhat modified version. A document of high importance is a summary of the life and achievements of Augustus, already mentioned, and known as the Monumentum Ancyranum. The various sets of Fasti constituted a record of the names of consuls, and other magistrates or high officials, and also of the triumphs accorded to conquering generals.

====Inscriptions on tombs====

These are probably the most numerous of all classes of inscriptions; and though many of them are of no great individual interest, they convey, when taken collectively, much valuable information as to the distribution and transference of population, as to trades and professions, as to health and longevity, and as to many other conditions of ancient life. The most interesting early series is that on the tombs of the Scipios at Rome, recording, mostly in Saturnian Metre, the exploits and distinctions of the various members of that family.

About the end of the republic and the beginning of the empire, it became customary to head a tombstone with the letters &#x27; or &#x27; (), thus consecrating the tomb to the deceased as having become members of the body of ghosts or spirits of the dead. These are followed by the name of the deceased, usually with his father&#x27;s name and his tribe, by his honours and distinctions, sometimes by a record of his age. The inscription often concludes with &#x27; (), or some similar formula, and also, frequently, with a statement of boundaries and a prohibition of violation or further use – for instance, &#x27; (, this monument is not to pass to the heir). The person who has erected the monument and his relation to the deceased are often stated; or if a man has prepared the tomb in his lifetime, this also may be stated, (). But there is an immense variety in the information that either a man himself or his friend may wish to record.

====Milestones and boundaries====

Milliarium (milestones) have already been referred to, and may be regarded as records of the building of roads. Boundary stones () are frequently found, both of public and private property. A well-known instance is offered by those set up by the commissioners called () in the time of the Gracchi.

<doc id="437615" wikidata="Q78750" url="?curid=437615" title="Eugen Sänger">
<text>Eugen Sänger (22 September 1905 – 10 February 1964) was an Austrian aerospace engineer best known for his contributions to lifting body and ramjet technology.

== Early career ==

Sänger was born in the former mining town of Preßnitz (Přísečnice), near Komotau in Bohemia, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at that time . He studied civil engineering at the Technical Universities of Graz and Vienna. As a student, he came in contact with Hermann Oberth&#x27;s book &quot;Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen&quot; (&quot;By Rocket into Planetary Space&quot;), which inspired him to change from studying civil engineering to aeronautics. He also joined Germany&#x27;s amateur rocket movement, the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (VfR – &quot;Society for Space Travel&quot;) which was centered on Oberth.

In 1932 Sänger became a member of the SS and was also a member of the NSDAP.

Sänger made rocket-powered flight the subject of his thesis, but it was rejected by the university as too fanciful.

Sänger was allowed to graduate when he submitted a far more mundane paper on the statics of wing trusses. Sänger would later publish his rejected thesis under the title &quot;Raketenflugtechnik&quot; (&quot;Rocket Flight Engineering&quot;) in 1933. In 1935 and 1936, he published articles on rocket-powered flight for the Austrian journal &quot;Flug&quot; (&quot;Flight&quot;). These attracted the attention of the (RLM, or &quot;Reich Aviation Ministry&quot;) which saw Sänger&#x27;s ideas as a potential way to accomplish the goal of building a bomber that could strike the United States from Germany (the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; project). The RLM gave him a research institute near Braunschweig and also built a liquid oxygen plant and a test stand for a 100 tonne thrust engine. At the time, Sänger&#x27;s hiring was opposed by Wernher von Braun, who felt that his own work was being duplicated and may have seen the Austrian and his work as a threat to his own dominance of the field.

==Sub-orbital bomber concept==

Sänger agreed to lead a rocket development team in the &quot;Lüneburger Heide&quot; region in 1936. He gradually conceived a rocket-powered sled that would launch a bomber with its own rocket engines that would climb to the fringe of space and then skip along the upper atmosphere – not actually entering orbit, but able to cover vast distances in a series of sub-orbital hops. This remarkable design was called the &quot;Silbervogel&quot; (&quot;Silverbird&quot;) and would have relied on its fuselage creating lift (as a lifting body) to carry it along its sub-orbital path. Sänger was assisted in this design by mathematician Irene Bredt, whom he married in 1951. Sänger also designed the rocket motors that the space-plane would use, which would need to generate 1 meganewton (225,000 lbf) of thrust. In this design, he was one of the first to suggest using the rocket&#x27;s fuel as a way of cooling the engine, by circulating it around the rocket nozzle before burning it in the engine.

By 1942, the Reich Air Ministry canceled this project along with other more ambitious and theoretical designs in favour of concentrating on proven technologies. Sänger was sent to work for the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (DFS, or &quot;German Gliding Research Institute&quot;). There he did important work on ramjet technology, working on projects such as the Skoda-Kauba Sk P.14 interceptor, until the end of World War II.

==Postwar==
After the war ended, Sänger worked for the French government and in 1949 founded the &quot;Fédération Astronautique&quot;. Whilst in France, he was the subject of a botched attempt by Soviet agents to win him over. Joseph Stalin had become intrigued by reports of the &quot;Silbervogel&quot; design and sent his son, Vasily, and scientist Grigori Tokaty to convince him to come to the Soviet Union, but they failed to do so. It has also been reported that Stalin instructed the NKVD to kidnap him.

In 1951, he became the first President of the International Astronautical Federation. In the same year he married Dr. Irene Bredt, his first assistant, a German engineer, mathematician and physicist co-credited with the design of a proposed intercontinental spaceplane/bomber.

By 1954, Sänger had returned to Germany and three years later was directing a jet propulsion research institute in Stuttgart. Between 1961 and 1963 he acted as a consultant for Junkers in designing a ramjet-powered space-plane that never left the drawing board. In 1963, he became full professor at Technische Universität Berlin, where he worked until his death. Sänger&#x27;s other theoretical innovations during this period were proposing means of using photons for interplanetary and interstellar spacecraft propulsion prefiguring the concept of laser propulsion and the solar sail.
In 1960, he assisted the United Arab Republic in developing the Al-Zafir missile.

He died in Berlin, in 1964. Sänger&#x27;s grave is located in the cemetery &quot;Alter Friedhof&quot; in Stuttgart-Vaihingen. 
His work on the &quot;Silbervogel&quot; would prove important to the X-15, X-20 Dyna-Soar, and ultimately Space Shuttle programs. The Saenger spaceplane concept was named after him.

<doc id="437619" wikidata="Q657936" url="?curid=437619" title="Shear stress">
<text>Shear stress (often denoted by , Greek: tau) is the component of stress coplanar with a material cross section. It arises from the shear force, the component of force vector parallel to the material cross section. &quot;Normal stress&quot;, on the other hand, arises from the force vector component perpendicular to the material cross section on which it acts.

==General shear stress==
The formula to calculate average shear stress or force per unit area is:
formula_1where is the force applied and is the cross-sectional area.

The area involved corresponds to the material face parallel to the applied force vector, i.e., with surface normal vector perpendicular to the force.

==Other forms==
===Wall shear stress===
Wall shear stress expresses the retarding force (per unit area) from a wall in the layers of a fluid flowing next to the wall. It is defined as:formula_2where is the dynamic viscosity, is the flow velocity, and is the distance from the wall.

It is used, for example, in the description of arterial blood flow, where there is evidence that it affects the atherogenic process.

===Pure===
Pure shear stress is related to pure shear strain, denoted , by the equationformula_3where is the shear modulus of the isotropic material, given byformula_4Here, is Young&#x27;s modulus and is Poisson&#x27;s ratio.

===Beam shear===
Beam shear is defined as the internal shear stress of a beam caused by the shear force applied to the beam:formula_5where

The beam shear formula is also known as Zhuravskii shear stress formula after Dmitrii Ivanovich Zhuravskii, who derived it in 1855.

===Semi-monocoque shear===

Shear stresses within a semi-monocoque structure may be calculated by idealizing the cross-section of the structure into a set of stringers (carrying only axial loads) and webs (carrying only shear flows). Dividing the shear flow by the thickness of a given portion of the semi-monocoque structure yields the shear stress. Thus, the maximum shear stress will occur either in the web of maximum shear flow or minimum thickness.

Constructions in soil can also fail due to shear; , the weight of an earth-filled dam or dike may cause the subsoil to collapse, like a small landslide.

===Impact shear===
The maximum shear stress created in a solid round bar subject to impact is given by the equationformula_6where

Furthermore, 

where 

===Shear stress in fluids===

Any real fluids (liquids and gases included) moving along a solid boundary will incur a shear stress at that boundary. The no-slip condition dictates that the speed of the fluid at the boundary (relative to the boundary) is zero; although at some height from the boundary, the flow speed must equal that of the fluid. The region between these two points is named the boundary layer. For all Newtonian fluids in laminar flow, the shear stress is proportional to the strain rate in the fluid, where the viscosity is the constant of proportionality. For non-Newtonian fluids, the viscosity is not constant. The shear stress is imparted onto the boundary as a result of this loss of velocity.

For a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress at a surface element parallel to a flat plate at the point is given byformula_7where

Specifically, the wall shear stress is defined asformula_8Newton&#x27;s constitutive law, for any general geometry (including the flat plate above mentioned), states that shear tensor (a second-order tensor) is proportional to the flow velocity gradient (the velocity is a vector, so its gradient is a second-order tensor):formula_9The constant of proportionality is named &quot;dynamic viscosity&quot;. For an isotropic Newtonian flow, it is a scalar, while for anisotropic Newtonian flows, it can be a second-order tensor. The fundamental aspect is that for a Newtonian fluid, the dynamic viscosity is independent of flow velocity (i.e., the shear stress constitutive law is &quot;linear&quot;), while for non-Newtonian flows this is not true, and one should allow for the modificationformula_10This no longer Newton&#x27;s law but a generic tensorial identity: one can always find an expression of the viscosity as function of the flow velocity given any expression of the shear stress as function of the flow velocity. On the other hand, given a shear stress as function of the flow velocity, it represents a Newtonian flow only if it can be expressed as a constant for the gradient of the flow velocity. The constant one finds in this case is the dynamic viscosity of the flow.

== Measurement with sensors ==
===Diverging fringe shear stress sensor===
This relationship can be exploited to measure the wall shear stress. If a sensor could directly measure the gradient of the velocity profile at the wall, then multiplying by the dynamic viscosity would yield the shear stress. Such a sensor was demonstrated by A. A. Naqwi and W. C. Reynolds. The interference pattern generated by sending a beam of light through two parallel slits forms a network of linearly diverging fringes that seem to originate from the plane of the two slits (see double-slit experiment). As a particle in a fluid passes through the fringes, a receiver detects the reflection of the fringe pattern. The signal can be processed, and from the fringe angle, the height and velocity of the particle can be extrapolated. The measured value of the wall velocity gradient is independent of the fluid properties, and as a result does not require calibration. Recent advancements in the micro-optic fabrication technologies have made it possible to use integrated diffractive optical elements to fabricate diverging fringe shear stress sensors usable both in air and liquid.

===Micro-pillar shear-stress sensor===

A further measurement technique is that of slender wall-mounted micro-pillars made of the flexible polymer polydimethylsiloxane, which bend in reaction to the applying drag forces in the vicinity of the wall. The sensor thereby belongs to the indirect measurement principles relying on the relationship between near-wall velocity gradients and the local wall-shear stress.

===Electro-diffusional method===
The electro-diffusional method measures the wall shear rate in the liquid phase from microelectrodes under limiting diffusion current conditions. A potential difference between an anode of a broad surface (usually located far from the measuring area) and the small working electrode acting as a cathode leads to a fast redox reaction. The ion disappearance occurs only on the microprobe active surface, causing the development of the diffusion boundary layer, in which the fast electro-diffusion reaction rate is controlled only by diffusion. The resolution of the convective-diffusive equation in the near-wall region of the microelectrode lead to analytical solutions relying the characteristics length of the microprobes, the diffusional properties of the electrochemical solution, and the wall shear rate.

<text>Christopher Logue, CBE (23 November 1926 – 2 December 2011) was an English poet associated with the British Poetry Revival, and a pacifist.

== Life ==
Born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, and brought up in the Portsmouth area, Logue was the only child of middle-aged parents, John and Molly Logue, who married late. He attended Roman Catholic schools, including St John&#x27;s College, Portsmouth, Prior Park College, before going to Portsmouth Grammar School. On call-up, he enlisted in the Black Watch, and was posted to Palestine. He was court-martialled in 1945 over a scheme to sell stolen pay books, and sentenced to 16 months&#x27; imprisonment, served partly in Acre Prison. He lived in Paris from 1951 to 1956, and was a friend of Alexander Trocchi.
In 1958 he joined the first of the Aldermaston Marches, organised by the Direct Action Committee Against Nuclear War. He was on the Committee of 100. 
He served a month in jail for refusing to be bound over not to continue with the 17 September 1961 Parliament Square sit-down. He heard Bertrand Russell tell the Bow Street magistrate, &quot;I came here to save your life. But, having heard what you have to say, I don&#x27;t think the end justifies the means.&quot; In Drake Hall open prison he and fellow protesters were set to work – &quot;Some wit allocated it&quot; – demolishing a munitions factory.

He was friends for many years with author and translator Austryn Wainhouse, with whom he carried on a lively correspondence for decades.

== Career ==
Logue was a playwright and screenwriter as well as a film actor. His screenplays were &quot;Savage Messiah&quot; and &quot;The End of Arthur&#x27;s Marriage&quot;. He was a contributor to &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine between 1962 and 1993, as well as writing for Alexander Trocchi&#x27;s literary journal, &quot;Merlin&quot;. 
Logue won the 2005 Whitbread Poetry Award for &quot;Cold Calls&quot;.

His early popularity was marked by the release of a loose adaptation of Pablo Neruda&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Love Poems&quot;, later broadcast on BBC Radio&#x27;s Third Programme on 8 March 1959 with the poems, read by Logue himself, set to jazz by pianist Bill Le Sage and drummer Tony Kinsey and a band featuring Kenny Napper on bass, Ken Wray on trombone and Les Condon on trumpet. A version of the performance was later released as a 7-inch EP (extended play) record, &quot;Red Bird: Jazz and Poetry&quot;.

One of his poems, &quot;Be Not Too Hard&quot;, was set to music by Donovan and heard in the film &quot;Poor Cow&quot; (1967), and was made popular by Joan Baez on her eponymous 1967 album, &quot;Joan&quot;. Another completely different song titled &quot;Be Not Too Hard&quot; based on the poem was performed by Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band on their 1974 album &quot;The Good Earth&quot;. The arrangement was written by Mick Rogers, who had Logue credited as a co-writer on the record sleeve. Another well-known and well-quoted poem by Logue was &quot;Come to the Edge&quot;, which is often attributed to Guillaume Apollinaire, but is in fact only dedicated to him. It was originally written for a poster advertising an Apollinaire exhibition at the ICA in 1961 or 1962, and was titled &quot;Apollinaire Said&quot;, hence the misattribution. 
His last major work was a long-term project to render Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; into a modernist idiom. 
This work is published in a number of small books, usually equating to two or three books of the original text. (The volume, &quot;Homer: War Music&quot;, was shortlisted for the 2002 International Griffin Poetry Prize.)
He published an autobiography, &quot;Prince Charming&quot; (1999).

His lines tended to be short, pithy and frequently political, as in &quot;Song of Autobiography&quot;:
He wrote the couplet that is sung at the beginning and end of the film &quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot; (1965), the screenplay for &quot;Savage Messiah&quot; (1972), a television version of &quot;Antigone&quot; (1962), and a short play for the TV series &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; titled &quot;The End of Arthur&#x27;s Marriage&quot; (1965), which was directed by Ken Loach. The latter film was generally light-hearted, but dealt with the pre-occupation in modern British society with ownership of property and with the treatment of animals by humans.

He appeared in a number of films as an actor, most notably in the Ken Russell films &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971, as Cardinal Richelieu) and &quot;Prisoner of Honor&quot; (1991, as Fernand Labori), and as the spaghetti-eating fanatic in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (1977).
Logue wrote for the Olympia Press under the pseudonym Count Palmiro Vicarion, including a pornographic novel, &quot;Lust&quot;.

== Family ==
Logue married biographer Rosemary Hill in 1985. He died on 2 December 2011, aged 85.

<text>The black-throated blue warbler (Setophaga caerulescens) is a small passerine bird of the New World warbler family. Its breeding ranges are located in the interior of deciduous and mixed coniferous forests in eastern North America. Over the cooler months, it migrates to islands in the Caribbean and Central America. It is very rarely found in western Europe, where it is considered to be a non-indigenous species. The black-throated blue warbler is sexually dimorphic; the adult male has a black face and cheeks, deep blue upperparts and white underparts, while the adult female is olive-brown above and light yellow below.

Predominantly insectivorous, the black-throated blue warbler supplements its diet with berries and seeds in winter. It builds its nests in thick shrubs and the closeness of its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored species for the study of warbler behavior in the wild. The black-throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats. As the black-throated blue warbler requires large, unbroken forest areas for nesting, its numbers are declining.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin described the black-throated blue warbler in 1789. Its species name is the Latin adjective &quot;caerulescens&quot; meaning &quot;turning blue&quot;.

The black-throated blue warbler is one of the New World warblers or wood-warblers in the family Parulidae. This species was originally placed under the genus &quot;Dendroica&quot;. It was recently adjusted to be a member of genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; along with all other members of the genus &quot;Dendroica&quot;, based on the findings from a recent phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA in 2010. The old genus &quot;Dendroica&quot; was then deleted. Within the genus, it appears to have no particularly close relatives.

The species breeds in North America and winters in the Caribbean. Some studies have observed significant differences in terms of migratory behavior and plumage color between northern and southern populations within the breeding range. The northern population mainly winters in the western Caribbean (Cuba and Jamaica) while the southern population usually spends the winter on eastern islands (Hispaniola and Puerto Rico). Moreover, males in the southern population have darker plumage than those in the northern population. These differences have led biologists to consider them as separate subspecies. However, a recent study in the United States reveals no significant genetic differentiation between northern (samples from Michigan, New Hampshire and New York states) and southern populations (sample from North Carolina). The study results actually show a recent population expansion from a single glacial refugium, therefore the current populations are homogeneous in terms of genetics. The differentiation that is observed between the northern and southern populations should have occurred quite recently.

==Description==

The black-throated blue warbler measures in length and weighs . Wingspan ranges from 7.5–7.9 in (19–20 cm). This is a strongly sexually dimorphic bird. The adult male has white underparts with a black throat, face and flanks. The upperparts are deep blue. The immature male is similar, but with greener upperparts. The female has olive-brown upperparts and light yellow underparts with darker wings and tail, gray crown and brown patches on the cheek. Both sexes have a thin pointed bill and small white wing patches which are not always visible. Like many other warbler species, it has colorful plumage during the spring and summer. However, outside the breeding season its plumage is drab and less distinctive. In the fall, the black-throated blue warbler can be distinguished by its small white wing patches. Juveniles have brown upperparts with a creamy supercilium and brownish spots on the throat, the breast and the belly.

The bird&#x27;s song can be described as a buzzed &#x27; with an upward inflection. Its call is a flat &#x27;.
==Distribution and habitat==

The black-throated blue warbler is a migratory species. It breeds in temperate mature deciduous forests or mixed coniferous-deciduous forest with a thick understory. The species is often found in hilly and mountainous regions in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. In late summer, it migrates to the tropical wooded and scrub habitats in the Greater Antilles for wintering. Along the migration route, the black-throated blue warbler can be observed in habitats such as parks and gardens. 
Its nesting site is more important than its foraging site in playing a role in determining the habitat of the black-throated blue warbler. The black-throated blue warbler is an open-nesting species, that nests very close to the ground so it has to choose a protected nesting site where the risk of predation is relatively low.

==Behavior==

===Feeding and foraging===

The black-throated blue warbler forages actively in low vegetation, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. It often forages in one area for a while before moving on to the next. It mainly eats invertebrates such as caterpillars, crane flies, and spiders. It may supplement its diet with seeds, berries, and fruit in the winter.

Males and females prefer different foraging sites. While males usually hover among the higher shrub foliage between , females tend to forage at lower strata. The time within a breeding season influences where the males forage. When it is time to feed the fledglings, males come down to the same foraging strata as females.
The black-throated blue warbler mostly forages in the understory instead of the canopy. The large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors. The black-throated blue warbler more often hovers rather than gleans its prey because it is more difficult to glean among thick understory foliage.

===Breeding===

The black-throated blue warbler is a monogamous species. Its breeding season usually begins in May and ends in July. As a songbird, the male black-throated blue warbler attracts a female&#x27;s attention by singing a soft melody. He then follows the female while she is foraging or searching for nesting sites. As soon as the female stops to rest, the male droops his wings slightly, stretches his head forward and up, opens his bill, and faces the female. The female also makes displays to the male by vibrating her wings. In response, the male mounts the female for 2–3 seconds and then flies off. Females lay an average of 3.6 eggs per brood (range: 2 – 5 eggs) and incubate the eggs without male assistance for approximately 12 days. Both parents will feed offspring for approximately 9 days before the young are ready to fledge.

A 1996, researchers showed that the black-throated blue warbler prefers to reside in hardwood forests with higher shrub densities where food is more abundant compared to lower shrub density plots. Within these high shrub density habitats, not only is there a higher density of warblers, but the population age average is also older, being composed of males and females who are at least two years of age.

The black-throated blue warbler uses social cues in its evaluation and choice of nesting sites. In particular, it listens to the post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males sing at the beginning and the peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative of reproductive success. Near the end of a breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators of reproductive success within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding dispersers. In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, does not respond to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites.

====Extra-pair mating====
Although the black-throated blue warbler is a socially monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and that the majority of the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.

Males engage in mate guarding during the period females are most vulnerable to successful extra pair copulations. They usually stay close to their social mate, singing slowly on the side and following the mate while she is foraging or searching for a nesting site. The guarding behavior, though, may conflict with males&#x27; pursuit of extra-pair fertilizations. It is not yet clear to what extent a male will prefer mate guarding over extra-pair fertilizations. Male retention studies have shown that removal of a male increases the chance of extra-pair offspring in the brood, suggesting that mate guarding reduces extra-pair fertilization attempts. The extra-pair fertilization rate nonetheless cannot be eliminated even if males are allowed to stay near their social mates during fertility risk period. Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon: females may be able to manage extra-pair mating even while its social mate is guarding it, or females may reject extra-pair copulation attempts by other males in the absence of male guarding.

Females who participate in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but they are likely to receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.

===Sexual selection===

Males&#x27; differential recognition of local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) and the other in the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a &quot;heterospecific&quot; male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely to play a role in gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.

It has long been believed that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have a greater degree of directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage.

==Status and threats==

The black-throated blue warbler enjoys a large range and a big population. Its population trend is currently increasing. This species was ranked as Least Concern by the IUCN in 2012. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation are threatening the black-throated blue warbler in its tropical wintering areas. A report in 2000 discussed the impact of global climate change on the population dynamics of the black-throated blue warbler by an observation from 1986 to 1998. In particular, the effect of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was studied in relation to the survival, fecundity and recruitment of this migratory bird. It was found that El Niño years (the warm South Pacific oceanic phase) were associated with lower adult survival rate in their wintering ground, Jamaica, lower fecundity in the breeding habitats in New Hampshire of the United States, and lower annual recruitment of yearlings and juveniles to both breeding and wintering grounds. All the three factors were relatively higher during La Niña years (cold South Pacific Ocean) when the weather was wetter and the food availability was much more abundant. Long-term global warming can aggravate the ENSO effect, adding to the fluctuation of the black-throated blue warbler population.

<text>is a district on the western outskirts of Kyoto, Japan. It also refers to the mountain across the Ōi River, which forms a backdrop to the district. Arashiyama is a nationally designated Historic Site and Place of Scenic Beauty.

==Notable tourist sites==
*Arashiyama Bamboo Grove (a.k.a. the Sagano Bamboo Forest)
*The Iwatayama Monkey Park on the slopes of Arashiyama. Over 170 monkeys live at the park. While the monkeys are wild, they have become accustomed to humans. The park is on a small mountain not far from the Saga-Arashiyama rail station. Visitors can approach and photograph the monkeys. At the summit is a fenced enclosure where visitors can feed the monkeys.
*The &quot;Moon Crossing Bridge&quot; (渡月橋, Togetsukyō), notable for its views of cherry blossoms and autumn colors on the slopes of Arashiyama.
*The tombstone of the Heike courtesan Kogo of Sagano.
*Tenryū-ji, the main temple of one of the 15 branches of the Rinzai school, one of the two main sects of Zen Buddhism in Japan.
*The hamlet of Kiyotaki, a small scenic village at the base of Mt. Atago, the home to a notable Shinto shrine.
*Matsunoo-taisha, a shrine half a mile south of the area, is home to a blessed spring. It is one of the oldest shrines in the Kyoto area, founded in 700. The alleged restorative properties of the spring bring many local &quot;sake&quot; and &quot;miso&quot; companies for prayers that their product will be blessed.
*Kameyama koen has a stone commemorating Zhou Enlai&#x27;s visit to Arashiyama. He was moved by the cherry blossoms and mountain greenery. The four poems he wrote about his visit are engraved on a stone monument: &quot;Arashiyama in the Rain.&quot;
*Ōkōchi Sansō, the Japanese-style home and gardens of the film actor Denjirō Ōkōchi.
*Cherry trees bloom in spring and leaves turn red in autumn.

==Transport==
Arashiyama is a walkable area accessible by the Keifuku Electric Railroad (via Arashiyama Station (Keifuku)) from central Kyoto or by the Hankyū Arashiyama Line (via Arashiyama Station (Hankyu)) from Katsura Station, with connections from Osaka and Kyoto. Additionally, the JR Saga-Arashiyama Station is located in the district&#x27;s suburbs.

==Togetsukyō==

Togetsukyō (渡月橋) is a bridge across the river. It is the subject of one of the &quot;Famous Views of the Sixty-odd Provinces&quot; ukiyo-e prints. The Japanese used mostly concrete in 1934 to rebuild the Togetsukyo Bridge, unlike the original destroyed wooden version of the bridge from 836.

The river has three different names that denote its upper, middle, and lower stretches. It is called the in the upper course (not to be confused with the homophonously named , further to the east in Shizuoka Prefecture), the in the middle course, and the in the lower course.

<text>Jens Christian Skou (; 8 October 1918 – 28 May 2018) was a Danish biochemist and Nobel laureate.

==Early life==
Skou was born in Lemvig, Denmark to a wealthy family. His father Magnus Martinus Skou was a timber and coal merchant. His mother Ane-Margrethe Skou took over the company after the death of his father. At the age of 15, Skou entered a boarding school in Haslev, Zealand. He graduated in medicine from the University of Copenhagen in 1944 and received his doctorate in 1954. He began working at the Aarhus University in 1947 and was appointed professor of biophysics in 1977. He retired from the Aarhus University in 1988, but kept offices at the Department of Physiology (today part of the Department of Biomedicine).

==Career==
In 1997 he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (together with Paul D. Boyer and John E. Walker) for his discovery of Na+,K+-ATPase, making him, at the time of his death, the latest Danish Nobel laureate and the first at Aarhus University.

Skou had taken a few years away from his clinical training in the early 1950s to study the action of local anaesthetics. He had discovered that a substance’s anaesthetic action was related to its ability to dissolve in a layer of the lipid part of the plasma membrane, the anaesthetic molecules affected the opening of sodium channels which he assumed to be protein. This, he argued, would affect the movement of sodium ions and make nerve cells inexcitable, thus causing anaesthesia.

Skou thought that other types of membrane protein might also be affected by local anaesthetics dissolving in the lipid part of the membrane. He therefore had the idea of looking at an enzyme which was embedded in the membrane and finding out if its properties were affected by local anaesthetics. He looked at ATPase in crab nerves.

The enzyme was there, but its activity was very variable and he needed a highly active enzyme for his studies. Eventually he managed to discover that ATPase was most active when exposed to the right combination of sodium, potassium and magnesium ions. Only then did he realise that this enzyme might have something to do with the active movement of sodium and potassium across the plasma membrane. This idea had been postulated many years before, however, the mechanism was quite unknown.

Skou published his findings. However, in his paper he was wary of identifying the enzyme with the active ion movement, so he left out the term “sodium-potassium pump” from the title of his paper. Indeed, he seems to have realised the importance of his discovery only gradually, and he continued his studies on local anaesthetics.

In 1958 Skou went to a conference in Vienna to describe his work on cholinesterase. There he met Robert Post (born 1920), who had been studying the pumping of sodium and potassium in red blood cells. Post had recently discovered that three sodium ions were pumped out of the cell for every two potassium ions pumped in, and in his research he had made use of a substance called ouabain (or g-strophanthin) which had recently been shown to inhibit the pump).

Post had not read Skou’s paper, but he was excited when Skou told him about his work with ATPase. Post asked whether the enzyme was inhibited by ouabain. At this stage Skou was unaware that ouabain inhibited the pump, but he immediately telephoned his lab and arranged for the experiment to be done. Ouabain did indeed inhibit the enzyme, thus establishing a link between the enzyme and the sodium-potassium pump.

Following the Nobel Prize, Skou gave several interviews recounting the story of his discoveries, and at age 94 was reported to still keep up with publications in his field. He died on 28 May 2018 in Aarhus, Denmark at the age of 99, less than five months shy of his 100th birthday.

<text>The War Hound and the World&#x27;s Pain is a 1981 fantasy novel by English writer Michael Moorcock, the first of the &quot;von Bek&quot; series of novels.

==Plot summary==
The book is set in Europe ravaged by the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Its hero Ulrich von Bek is a mercenary and freethinker, who finds himself a damned soul in a castle owned by Lucifer. Much to his surprise, von Bek is charged by Lucifer with doing God&#x27;s work, by finding the Holy Grail, the &quot;cure for the world&#x27;s pain&quot;, that will also cure Lucifer&#x27;s pain by reconciling him with God. Only through doing this can von Bek save his soul.

After many adventures, von Bek eventually finds the Holy Grail, and discovers that it will set mankind on the path to self-redemption through rationality, without the help of God or the hindrance of Lucifer.

The story has a sequel in &quot;The City in the Autumn Stars&quot; (1986).

==Reception==
Dave Pringle reviewed &quot;The War Hound and the World&#x27;s Pain&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine: &quot;I am pleased to report that it makes a delightful read. It is much superior to the earlier quickies in, say, the &#x27;Dorian Hawkmoon&#x27; series, Moorcock has honed his skills over the years, and they now show a fine gleaming edge&quot;.

<text>The year 1796 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events.

==Astronomy==
* Pierre-Simon Laplace publishes &quot;Exposition du système du monde&quot;, his work on astronomy (mainly celestial mechanics) following Newton and Lagrange. He develops an analytical theory of tides, deduces the mass of the Moon, improves the calculation of cosmic orbits, and predicts that Saturn&#x27;s rings will be found to rotate. Most notably, he propounds the modern nebular hypothesis, independently outlined by Kant.

==Chemistry==
* Rev. James Parker is granted a patent in Britain for Roman cement (&quot;A certain Cement or Terras to be used in Aquatic and other Buildings and Stucco Work&quot;).

==Exploration==
* June 21 – Mungo Park becomes the first European to reach the Niger River.

==Mathematics==
* This is a productive year for the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (born 1777) and his work in number theory:
** March 30 – He obtains conditions for the constructibility by ruler and compass of regular polygons, including the heptadecagon.
** April 8 – He becomes the first to prove the quadratic reciprocity law, enabling determination of the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic.
** May 31 – He puts forward his prime number theorem on the distribution of prime numbers among the integers.
** July 10 – He discovers that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three triangular numbers, noting in his diary &quot;Heureka! num = Δ + Δ + Δ.&quot;
** October 1 – He publishes a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in finite fields.
* Adrien-Marie Legendre conjectures the prime number theorem.

==Medicine==
* May 14 – Edward Jenner administers the first smallpox vaccination.
* Franz Joseph Gall develops his theory of &#x27;cranioscopy&#x27;, a forerunner of phrenology.
* The Retreat established in York, England; it pioneers the humane treatment of people with mental disorders.

==Paleontology==
* April 4 – Georges Cuvier reads his paper &quot;Mémoires sur les espèces d&#x27;éléphants vivants et fossiles&quot; at the opening of the &quot;Institut National&quot; in Paris, demonstrating that species had become extinct.

==Technology==
* Completion of the first cast iron aqueducts, on the English canals
** February – Holmes Aqueduct on the Derby Canal, designed by Benjamin Outram (demolished 1971).
** March – Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct on the Shrewsbury Canal, designed by Thomas Telford (extant).
* August 9 – Opening to traffic of the Wearmouth Bridge in England, designed by Thomas Paine in cast iron. The second in this material built after that at Ironbridge, but over twice as long, its span of 237 feet (72 m) makes it the world&#x27;s longest single-span vehicular bridge extant at this date.
* Printing by lithography is invented by Alois Senefelder in Bohemia.

==Zoology==
* Pierre André Latreille publishes &quot;Précis des caractères génériques des insectes, disposés dans un ordre naturel&quot;.

==Awards==
* Copley Medal: George Atwood

==Births==
* February 6 – John Stevens Henslow, English botanist (died 1861)
* February 10 – Henry De la Beche, English geologist (died 1855)
* February 17 – Philipp Franz von Siebold, German physician, botanist and traveler in Japan (died 1866)
* February 22 – Adolphe Quetelet, Belgian mathematician and astronomer (died 1874)
* March 27 – Robert James Graves, Irish physician (died 1853)
* June 1 – Sadi Carnot, French physicist (died 1832)
* July 29 – Walter Hunt, American inventor (died 1859)
* August – William Marsden, English surgeon (died 1867)
* August 15 – John Torrey, American botanist (died 1873)
* August 21 – James Lick, American philanthropist who endows the Lick Observatory (died 1876)
* September 19 – Richard Harlan, American zoologist (died 1843)
* December &quot;(approx. date)&quot; – William Banting, English undertaker and dietician (died 1878)

==Deaths==
* January 1 – Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde, French mathematician known for Vandermonde matrices.
* January 5 – Anna Barbara Reinhart, Swiss mathematician (born 1730)
* May 1 – Alexandre Guy Pingré, French astronomer and naval geographer (born 1711
* December 11 – Johann Daniel Titius, German astronomer (born 1729)

<text>The microcirculation is the circulation of the blood in the smallest blood vessels, the microvessels of the microvasculature present within organ tissues. The microvessels include terminal arterioles, metarterioles, capillaries, and venules. Arterioles carry oxygenated blood to the capillaries, and blood flows out of the capillaries through venules into veins.

In addition to these blood vessels, the microcirculation also includes lymphatic capillaries and collecting ducts. The main functions of the microcirculation are the delivery of oxygen and nutrients and the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2). It also serves to regulate blood flow and tissue perfusion, thereby affecting blood pressure and responses to inflammation which can include edema (swelling).

Most vessels of the microcirculation are lined by flattened cells of the endothelium and many of them are surrounded by contractile cells called pericytes. The endothelium provides a smooth surface for the flow of blood and regulates the movement of water and dissolved materials in the interstitial plasma between the blood and the tissues.

The microcirculation contrasts with macrocirculation, which is the circulation of blood to and from the organs.

==Structure==
===Microvessels===
The vessels on the arterial side of the microcirculation are called the arterioles, which are well innervated, are surrounded by smooth muscle cells, and are 10-50 μm in diameter. Arterioles carry the blood to the capillaries, which are not innervated, have no smooth muscle, and are about 5-8 μm in diameter. Blood flows out of the capillaries into the venules, which have little smooth muscle and are 10-200 μm. The blood flows from the venules into the veins. Metarterioles connect arterioles and capillaries. A tributary to the venules is known as a &quot;thoroughfare channel&quot;.

The microcirculation has three major components: pre-capillary, capillary, and post-capillary. In the pre-capillary sector, arterioles, and precapillary sphincters participate. Their function is to regulate blood flow before it enters the capillaries and venules by the contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscle found on their walls. The second sector is the capillary sector, which is represented by the capillaries, where substance and gas exchange between blood and interstitial fluid takes place. Finally, the post-capillary sector is represented by the post-capillary venules, which are formed by a layer of endothelial cells that allow free movement of some substances.

=== Microanatomy ===
Most vessels of the microcirculation are lined by flattened cells of the endothelium and many of them are surrounded by contractile cells called pericytes. The endothelium provides a smooth surface for the flow of blood and regulates the movement of water and dissolved materials in the interstitial plasma between the blood and the tissues. The endothelium also produces molecules that discourage the blood from clotting unless there is a leak. Pericyte cells can contract and decrease the size of the arterioles and thereby regulate blood flow and blood pressure.

== Function ==
In addition to these blood vessels, the microcirculation also includes lymphatic capillaries and collecting ducts. The main functions of the microcirculation are the delivery of oxygen and nutrients and the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2). It also serves to regulate blood flow and tissue perfusion thereby affecting blood pressure and responses to inflammation which can include edema (swelling).

===Regulation===
The regulation of tissue perfusion occurs in microcirculation. There, arterioles control the flow of blood to the capillaries. Arterioles contract and relax, varying their diameter and vascular tone, as the vascular smooth muscle responds to diverse stimuli. Distension of the vessels due to increased blood pressure is a fundamental stimulus for muscle contraction in arteriolar walls. As a consequence, microcirculation blood flow remains constant despite changes in systemic blood pressure. This mechanism is present in all tissues and organs of the human body. In addition, the nervous system participates in the regulation of microcirculation. The sympathetic nervous system activates the smaller arterioles, including terminals. Noradrenaline and adrenaline have effects on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Other hormones (catecholamine, renin-angiotensin, vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic peptide) circulate in the bloodstream and can have an effect on the microcirculation causing vasodilation or vasoconstriction. Many hormones and neuropeptides are released together with classical neurotransmitters.

Arterioles respond to metabolic stimuli that are generated in the tissues. When tissue metabolism increases, catabolic products accumulate leading to vasodilation. The endothelium begins to control muscle tone and arteriolar blood flow tissue. Endothelial function in the circulation includes the activation and inactivation of circulating hormones and other plasma constituents. There are also synthesis and secretion of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor substances for modifying the width as necessary. Variations in the flow of blood that circulates by arterioles are capable of responses in endothelium.

===Capillary exchange===
The term capillary exchange refers to all exchanges at microcirculatory level, most of which occurs in the capillaries. Sites where material exchange occurs between the blood and tissues are the capillaries, which branch out to increase the swap area, minimize the diffusion distance as well as maximize the surface area and the exchange time.

Approximately, seven percent of the body&#x27;s blood is in the capillaries which continuously exchange substances with the liquid outside these blood vessels, called interstitial fluid. This dynamic displacement of materials between the interstitial fluid and the blood is named capillary exchange. These substances pass through capillaries through three different systems or mechanisms: diffusion, bulk flow, and transcytosis or vesicular transport. The liquid and solid exchanges that take place in the microvasculature particularly involve capillaries and post-capillary venules and collecting venules.

Capillary walls allow the free flow of almost every substance in plasma. The plasma proteins are the only exception, as they are too big to pass through. The minimum number of un-absorbable plasma proteins that exit capillaries enter lymphatic circulation for returning later on to those blood vessels. Those proteins which leave capillaries use the first capillary exchange mechanism and the process of diffusion, which is caused by kinetic motion of molecules.

====Regulation====
These exchanges of substances are regulated by different mechanisms. These mechanisms work together and promote capillary exchange in the following way. First, molecules that diffuse are going to travel a short distance thanks to the capillary wall, the small diameter and the close proximity to each cell having a capillary. The short distance is important because the capillary diffusion rate decreases when the diffusion distance increases. Then, because of its large number (10-14 million capillaries), there is an incredible amount of surface area for exchange. However, this only has 5% of the total blood volume (250 ml 5000 ml). Finally, blood flows more slowly in the capillaries, given the extensive branching.

====Diffusion====
Diffusion is the first and most important mechanism that allows the flow of small molecules across capillaries. The process depends on the difference of gradients between the interstitium and blood, with molecules moving to low concentrated spaces from high concentrated ones. Glucose, amino acids, oxygen () and other molecules exit capillaries by diffusion to reach the organism&#x27;s tissues. Contrarily, carbon dioxide () and other wastes leave tissues and enter capillaries by the same process but in reverse. Diffusion through the capillary walls depends on the permeability of the endothelial cells forming the capillary walls, which may be continuous, discontinuous, and fenestrated. The Starling equation describes the roles of hydrostatic and osmotic pressures (the so-called Starling forces) in the movement of fluid across capillary endothelium. Lipids, which are transported by proteins, are too large to cross the capillary walls by diffusion, and have to rely on the other two methods.

====Bulk flow====
The second mechanism of capillary exchange is bulk flow. It is used by small, lipid-insoluble substances in order to cross. This movement depends on the physical characteristics of the capillaries. For example, continuous capillaries (tight structure) reduce bulk flow, fenestrated capillaries (perforated structure) increases bulk flow, and discontinuous capillaries (great intercellular gaps) enable bulk flow. In this case, the exchange of materials is determined by changes in pressure. When the flow of substances goes from the bloodstream or the capillary to the interstitial space or interstitium, the process is called filtration. This kind of movement is favored by blood hydrostatic pressure (BHP) and interstitial fluid osmotic pressure (IFOP). When substances move from the interstitial fluid to the blood in capillaries, the process is called reabsorption. The pressures that favor this movement are blood colloid osmotic pressure (BCOP) and interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (IFHP). Whether a substance is filtrated or reabsorbed depends on the net filtration pressure (NFP), which is the difference between hydrostatic (BHP and IFHP) and osmotic pressures (IFOP and BCOP). These pressures are known as the Starling forces. If the NFP is positive then there will be filtration, but if it is negative then reabsorption will occur.

====Transcytosis====
The third capillary exchange mechanism is transcytosis, also called vesicular transport. By this process, blood substances move across the endothelial cells that compose the capillary structure. Finally, these materials exit by exocytosis, the process by which vesicles go out from a cell to the interstitial space. Few substances cross by transcytosis: it is mainly used by large, lipid-insoluble molecules such as the insulin hormone. Once vesicles exit the capillaries, they go to the interstitium. Vesicles can go directly to a specific tissue or they can merge with other vesicles, so their contents are mixed. This intermixed material increases the functional capability of the vesicle.

<doc id="437678" wikidata="Q1311302" url="?curid=437678" title="John Riley (poet)">
<text>John Riley (10 October 1937 – 27 or 28 October 1978) was a poet who was associated with the British Poetry Revival.

Riley was born and raised in Leeds, and was educated at West Leeds High School. He served in the Royal Air Force from 1956 to 1958 before studying English as an exhibitioner at Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating in 1961. He then worked as a teacher in various schools around the Cambridge area. During this period, he became acquainted with many of the poets who constituted the Cambridge group, a key element of the Revival.

He left Cambridge in 1966 to take up a teaching post in Bicester, near Oxford. That same year, he set up the Grosseteste Press with his friend Tim Longville. The pair started a magazine, &quot;Grosseteste Review&quot;, two years later. Riley retired from teaching in 1970 and returned to Leeds to write full-time. In 1977, he was received into the Eastern Orthodox Church. He was murdered in an incident near his home on the night of 27–28 October 1978.

Riley was influenced by Charles Olson and Osip Mandelstam, whose poetry he translated into English. His first book, &quot;Ancient and Modern&quot;, was published in 1967 and the posthumous &quot;The Collected Works&quot; in 1980. The latter includes the first full printing of his major long poem, &quot;Czargrad&quot;, a work that reflected his religious outlook and preoccupation with Russian and Byzantine culture. A collection of &quot;Selected Poems&quot; was published by Carcanet Press in 1995.

<doc id="437680" wikidata="Q673662" url="?curid=437680" title="Arklow">
<text>Arklow ( ; ; ) is a town in County Wicklow on the southeast coast of Ireland. The town is overlooked by Ballymoyle Hill. It was founded by the Vikings in the ninth century. Arklow was the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the 1798 rebellion. Its proximity to Dublin led to it becoming a commuter town with a population of 13,163 as of the 2016 census. The 2022 census recorded a population of 13,399. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

Arklow is at the mouth of the River Avoca, the longest river wholly within County Wicklow. The town is divided by the river, which is crossed by the Nineteen Arches Bridge, a stone arch bridge linking the southern or main part of the town with the northern part, called Ferrybank. The Nineteen Arches Bridge is the longest handmade stone bridge in Ireland, and a plaque on the south end of the bridge acknowledges this.

== History ==

The town&#x27;s English name derives from &quot;Arnkell&#x27;s Lág&quot; (Arnkell was a Viking leader; a &quot;lág&quot; (low) was an area of land). Its Irish name, &quot;Inbhear Mór&quot; or &quot;An tInbhear Mór&quot;, means &quot;the large estuary&quot;. It is also known in Irish as &quot;Inbhear Dé&quot;, from the River Avonmore&#x27;s older name, &quot;Abhainn Dé&quot;.

Historically it was a major seafaring town, with both the shipping and fishing industries using the port, with shipbuilding also being a major industry.

One of the first recorded mentions of the Arklow area concerns Palladius, the first bishop of Ireland who was recorded as landing at Arklow in 431.

After the arrival of the Anglo-Normans, their leader Theobald Walter, ancestor of the Earls of Ormonde, was granted the town and castle of Arklow by Henry II of England. In 1264 the Dominican Order was granted a large tract of land, now known as Abbeylands, where they built Holy Cross Abbey. Some time after 1416, the Manor of Arklow came into the control of the MacMurrough Kings of Leinster, possibly after the death of James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond in 1452. In 1525, Muiris Kavanagh, King of Leinster from 1522 to 1531, returned Arklow and its lands to his nephew Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond.

During the Irish Confederate Wars in November 1649, a skirmish took place outside Arklow when Royalist soldiers under Murrough O&#x27;Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, ambushed English Commonwealth troops marching to reinforce Wexford. The attack was beaten off and an English garrison was installed in Arklow, while an attempt to retake the town by Irish Confederates in January 1650 failed.

In 1714, John Allen of Stillorgan, County Dublin, purchased the Manor of Arklow from James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, shortly before the latter went into exile as a Jacobite. In 1750, Allen&#x27;s eldest granddaughter Elizabeth, married John Proby, 1st Baron Carysfort, who came into possession of the Arklow Estate as a result.

In the Battle of Arklow on 9 June 1798, one of the bloodiest events of the 1798 rebellion, a large force of Wexford rebels attacked the town in an attempt to spread the rising to Dublin but were repulsed by the entrenched British forces with many hundreds killed.

Arklow Courthouse served as the local town hall, until the new Arklow library and municipal offices in Main Street were opened in April 2016.

== Education ==

There are five primary schools located in the town, St. Joseph&#x27;s Templerainey, St Micheal&#x27;s and St Peter&#x27;s Junior School, St. John&#x27;s Senior National School, Carysfort National School and Gaelscoil an Inbhir Mhóir.

There are four secondary schools within the town, which are St. Mary&#x27;s College, St.Kevin&#x27;s C.B.S., Glenart College and Gaelcholáiste na Mara.

== Transport and communications ==
=== Road ===
The M11 from Dublin to Rosslare bypasses Arklow between junctions 20 and 21. A 16.5 km upgrade to the N11 between Arklow and Rathnew began in April 2014 and was completed in July 2015. This connected the then-existing M11 Arklow Bypass with the existing M11 Rathnew/Ashford Bypass creating a motorway from Dublin to Gorey. This project also included the construction of a service area on the M11 Northbound, just north of Gorey, with direct access from the M11 Southbound via an overpass.

=== Rail ===

Rail connections are provided by Iarnród Éireann along the Dublin-Rosslare railway line, including commuter and intercity services in and out of the capital. Arklow railway station opened on 16 November 1863.

=== Bus ===
Bus Éireann provides several routes through Arklow, including the 2, 2X, 133 and 133X services. In addition, Wexford Bus operates several services linking Arklow with Dublin Airport.

== Economy ==
=== Fishing ===
In the 19th century, Arklow was used as a port for oyster fisheries, with 40 million oysters harvested from the surrounding oyster reefs in 1863. While numbers dropped significantly, due to intensive harvesting and pollution, as of 2021 the Native Oyster Reef Restoration Ireland (NORRI) group had been launched to encourage the reintroduction of oysters to the region. As of the 21st century, the fishing industry in Arklow mainly involves catches of whelks, mussels and herring.

===Industry ===
In 1884, Charles Stewart Parnell rented Big Rock townland from his cousin William Proby, Earl of Carysfort, and commenced quarrying. Parnell was also a supporter of the Arklow harbour scheme. The Parnell quarries closed in the 1920s.

In the early part of the 20th century, a large munitions factory, Kynoch, was established on the north side of the town. This factory employed several thousand workers during the First World War but closed shortly after it, all production being moved to South Africa. 17 workers were killed in an explosion at Kynoch in 1917. The town is also historically known for its shipbuilding industry and pottery. The latter was produced at Arklow Pottery, which closed in 1998.

In the 1960s, a state-owned fertiliser factory, Nitrogen Éireann Teoranta, later Irish Fertiliser Industries, was established on the outskirts of the town. This factory complex comprised a number of chemical plants and manufactured a range of fertilisers from basic raw materials. It closed in 2002.

There is still an industrial base in Arklow, with Servier remaining as one of the manufacturing companies in Arklow. Allergan formerly had a plant locally, but this closed in 2009. In 2009, Elavon, a credit card processing company, purchased a new business site at Arklow Business Park. In 2019, planning permission was granted for a data centre at the Avoca River Business Park.

=== Shipping and shipbuilding ===
The former national sail training vessel &quot;Asgard II&quot; was built by John Tyrrell &amp; Son Ltd in Arklow. Another John Tyrrell &amp; Son boat, &quot;Gipsy Moth III&quot;, was sailed to victory by Francis Chichester in the 1st Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race in 1960. His time of 40 and 1/2 days was 16 days faster than the previous record crossing.

While now more focused on leisure traffic than commercial traffic, Arklow Harbour remains the headquarters of Arklow Shipping, numerically the largest shipping company in Ireland. This company maintains a fleet of 56 cargo ships and a division in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

===Retail===
Arklow services a large catchment area (including a number of surrounding towns and villages) and has approximately 32,000m2 of retail space. As of 2018, approximately 20% of this retail space was vacant. Among the town&#x27;s largest retail centres is the Bridgewater Shopping Centre, which opened in 2007 and was sold in 2016 for €33.25 million.

== Environment ==
===Water quality===

As of 2007, the River Avoca was classified as &quot;seriously polluted&quot; by the Irish EPA as a result of the discharge of sewage directly into the river in addition to a long history of industrial pollution in the area from early mining operations and more recent chemical industries. In previous centuries, Arklow was renowned for oyster beds.

Raw effluent from the town still travels through the drainage system built in the 1930s and 1940s, and enters the River Avoca untreated via several sewage outfall pipes along the river. A sewage treatment plant has long been proposed for the area, and was first awarded planning permission in 1993. This was challenged unsuccessfully to An Bord Pleanála. However, subsequently no funding arrived from government, and the planning permission lapsed. Further ten-year planning permission was granted in 1999. This too was unsuccessfully challenged to An Bord Pleanála, with conditional planning approval given in 2005. In 2019, planning permission was again confirmed for a &quot;high-tech&quot; wastewater treatment facility, with construction commencing in August 2021.

===Services and development===
A recycling centre is located in one of the town&#x27;s industrial estates. It is run by Wicklow County Council.

A few kilometres into the Irish Sea is the Arklow Bank Wind Park. Opened in 2004, this wind farm consists of seven 106m turbines, with GE 3.6 MW generators. On 19 October 2022, one of the turbines was struck by lightning and severely damaged.

== Sports ==
The local Gaelic football club, Arklow Geraldines Ballymoney GAA, was founded in 1999 and is based at Pearse Park. Arklow Rock Parnells GAA club, founded in 1953, is primarily involved in hurling and camogie and plays at Parnell Park.

The town&#x27;s association football clubs include Arklow Town F.C. (founded in 1948), Arklow United F.C. (Ferndale Park), and Arklow Celtic F.C. (Celtic Park).

Arklow Rugby Club plays its home games at The Oval, and Arklow Rowing Club is based on the town&#x27;s South Quay.

St Benedict Inbhear Mór Athletics Club is registered with Athletics Ireland and based in Arklow. Arklow Lawn Tennis Club, founded in 1922, has three astroturf courts for use by members.

There is an 18-hole links golf course at Arklow Golf Club (founded 1927).

== Culture ==

The Seabreeze Festival is a three-day event in mid-July. The festival includes a number of live shows and events at various venues throughout the town, ending in a fireworks display.

Arklow has been both the birthplace and place of residence for many artists such as George Campbell who was born there, the son of the self-taught artist Gretta Bowen.

Lilian Davidson drew sketches and painted scenes of the town and beaches. One such work, &quot;The Netter, Arklow&quot; depicts a scene of a man repairing a net by the harbourside with the harbour in the background; on the reverse-side of the painting is a sketch of children playing on the south beach.

The first permanent rainbow road crossing in the Republic of Ireland was unveiled in Arklow in December 2021. The pride colours run across the street at the traffic lights on Arklow&#x27;s main street.

===Music===

Arklow is the title setting for Van Morrison&#x27;s 1974 song &quot;Streets of Arklow&quot;, one of eight songs he wrote on a three-week vacation back to Ireland, and featured on his album &quot;Veedon Fleece&quot;. The &quot;Battle of Arklow&quot; is a hornpipe and non-traditional set dance tune, and is often played at &quot;feiseanna&quot; and other Irish dance competitions.

Arklow is also the home town of pop singer and former Moloko member Róisín Murphy.

The Arklow Silver Band were featured on the track Red Hill Mining Town by U2, on their 1987 album The Joshua Tree.

The &quot;Arklow Music Festival&quot; is held in the town annually. It was established in 1970. The festival lasts a week and it involves people coming to compete from all around the country. They compete in solo forms and group forms.

==Administration==
Arklow had a board of town commissioners created under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act 1854. This was a tier of local government below that of the county. The town commissioners became an urban district council in the early twentieth century. The urban district council became a town council in 2002. It was abolished by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, with the powers and functions of the town council transferred to the county council. However, they are administered locally by Arklow Municipal District.

The local electoral area of Arklow, which also contains the surrounding areas, elects six councillors to Wicklow County Council. 
The electoral divisions in Arklow consists of Arklow No. 1 Urban, Arklow No. 2 Urban, Arklow Rural, Aughrim, Avoca, Ballinaclash, Ballinacor, Ballinderry, Ballyarthur, Cronebane, Dunganstown South, Dunganstown West, Ennereilly, Kilballyowen, Kilbride, Kilpipe, Knockrath, and Rathdrum.

Arklow is part of the Wicklow constituency for national elections and referendums, and South for European elections.

==Astronomy==
* March 28 – H. W. Olbers discovers the asteroid Pallas, the second known.
* May 6 – William Herschel coins the term &quot;asteroid&quot; and on July 1 first uses the term binary star to refer to a star which revolves around another.

==Biology==
* Pierre André Latreille begins publication of his &quot;Histoire naturelle générale et particulière des crustacés et insectes&quot;.
* George Montagu publishes his &quot;Ornithological Dictionary; or Alphabetical Synopsis of British Birds&quot;.

<doc id="437690" wikidata="Q519365" url="?curid=437690" title="Genmaicha">
<text>is a Japanese brown rice green tea consisting of green tea mixed with roasted popped brown rice. It is sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot;popcorn tea&quot; because a few grains of the rice pop during the roasting process and resemble popcorn, or as &quot;people&#x27;s tea&quot;, as the rice served as a filler and reduced the price of the tea, making it historically more available for poorer Japanese. Today all segments of society drink genmaicha. It was also used by people fasting for religious purposes or who found themselves to be between meals for long periods of time.

The sugar and starch from the rice cause the tea to have a warm, full, nutty flavor. It is considered easy to drink and makes the stomach feel better. Tea steeped from genmaicha has a light yellow hue. Its flavor is mild and combines the fresh grassy flavor of green tea with the aroma of the roasted rice.

Genmaicha is also sold with matcha (powdered green tea) added to it. This product is called . &quot;Matcha-iri genmaicha&quot; has a similar flavor to plain genmaicha, but the flavor is often stronger and the color more green than light yellow.

In South Korea, a very similar tea is called &quot;hyeonminokcha&quot; (, &#x27;brown rice green tea&#x27;), while the word &quot;hyeonmicha&quot; (), which is a cognate of &quot;genmaicha&quot;, refers to an infusion of roasted brown rice in boiling water.

<doc id="437701" wikidata="Q320723" url="?curid=437701" title="Dependent and independent variables">
<text>A variable is considered dependent if it depends on an independent variable. Dependent variables are studied under the supposition or demand that they depend, by some law or rule (e.g., by a mathematical function), on the values of other variables. Independent variables, in turn, are not seen as depending on any other variable in the scope of the experiment in question. In this sense, some common independent variables are time, space, density, mass, fluid flow rate, and previous values of some observed value of interest (e.g. human population size) to predict future values (the dependent variable).

Of the two, it is always the dependent variable whose is being studied, by altering inputs, also known as regressors in a statistical context. In an experiment, any variable that can be attributed a value without attributing a value to any other variable is called an independent variable. Models and experiments test the effects that the independent variables have on the dependent variables. Sometimes, even if their influence is not of direct interest, independent variables may be included for other things, such as to account for their potential confounding effect.

==In pure mathematics==
In mathematics, a function is a rule for taking an input (in the simplest case, a number or set of numbers) and providing an output (which may also be a number). A symbol that stands for an arbitrary input is called an independent variable, while a symbol that stands for an arbitrary output is called a dependent variable. The most common symbol for the input is , and the most common symbol for the output is ; the function itself is commonly written .

It is possible to have multiple independent variables or multiple dependent variables. For instance, in multivariable calculus, one often encounters functions of the form , where is a dependent variable and and are independent variables. Functions with multiple outputs are often referred to as vector-valued functions.

==In modeling and statistics==
In mathematical modeling, the relationship between the set of dependent variables and set of independent variables is studied.

In the simple stochastic linear model the term is the th value of the dependent variable and is the th value of the independent variable. The term is known as the &quot;error&quot; and contains the variability of the dependent variable not explained by the independent variable.

With multiple independent variables, the model is , where is the number of independent variables.

In statistics, more specifically in linear regression, a scatter plot of data is generated with as the independent variable and as the dependent variable. This is also called a bivariate dataset, . The simple linear regression model takes the form of , for . In this case, are independent random variables. This occurs when the measurements do not influence each other. Through propagation of independence, the independence of implies independence of , even though each has a different expectation value. Each has an expectation value of 0 and a variance of .
Expectation of Proof:

:formula_1

The line of best fit for the bivariate dataset takes the form and is called the regression line. and correspond to the intercept and slope, respectively.

In an experiment, the variable manipulated by an experimenter is something that is proven to work, called an independent variable. The dependent variable is the event expected to change when the independent variable is manipulated.

In data mining tools (for multivariate statistics and machine learning), the dependent variable is assigned a &quot;role&quot; as (or in some tools as &quot;label attribute&quot;), while an independent variable may be assigned a role as &quot;regular variable&quot; or feature variable. Known values for the target variable are provided for the training data set and test data set, but should be predicted for other data. The target variable is used in supervised learning algorithms but not in unsupervised learning.

Depending on the context, an independent variable is sometimes called a &quot;predictor variable&quot;, &quot;regressor&quot;, &quot;covariate&quot;, &quot;manipulated variable&quot;, &quot;explanatory variable&quot;, &quot;exposure variable&quot; (see reliability theory), &quot;risk factor&quot; (see medical statistics), &quot;feature&quot; (in machine learning and pattern recognition) or &quot;input variable&quot;.
In econometrics, the term &quot;control variable&quot; is usually used instead of &quot;covariate&quot;.

&quot;Explanatory variable&quot; is preferred by some authors over &quot;independent variable&quot; when the quantities treated as independent variables may not be statistically independent or independently manipulable by the researcher. If the independent variable is referred to as an &quot;explanatory variable&quot; then the term &quot;response variable&quot; is preferred by some authors for the dependent variable.

Depending on the context, a dependent variable is sometimes called a &quot;response variable&quot;, &quot;regressand&quot;, &quot;criterion&quot;, &quot;predicted variable&quot;, &quot;measured variable&quot;, &quot;explained variable&quot;, &quot;experimental variable&quot;, &quot;responding variable&quot;, &quot;outcome variable&quot;, &quot;output variable&quot;, &quot;target&quot; or &quot;label&quot;. In economics endogenous variables are usually referencing the target.

&quot;Explained variable&quot; is preferred by some authors over &quot;dependent variable&quot; when the quantities treated as &quot;dependent variables&quot; may not be statistically dependent. If the dependent variable is referred to as an &quot;explained variable&quot; then the term &quot;predictor variable&quot; is preferred by some authors for the independent variable.

An example is provided by the analysis of trend in sea level by . Here the dependent variable (and variable of most interest) was the annual mean sea level at a given location for which a series of yearly values were available. The primary independent variable was time. Use was made of a covariate consisting of yearly values of annual mean atmospheric pressure at sea level. The results showed that inclusion of the covariate allowed improved estimates of the trend against time to be obtained, compared to analyses which omitted the covariate.

==Other variables==
A variable may be thought to alter the dependent or independent variables, but may not actually be the focus of the experiment. So that the variable will be kept constant or monitored to try to minimize its effect on the experiment. Such variables may be designated as either a &quot;controlled variable&quot;, &quot;control variable&quot;, or &quot;fixed variable&quot;.

Extraneous variables, if included in a regression analysis as independent variables, may aid a researcher with accurate response parameter estimation, prediction, and goodness of fit, but are not of substantive interest to the hypothesis under examination. For example, in a study examining the effect of post-secondary education on lifetime earnings, some extraneous variables might be gender, ethnicity, social class, genetics, intelligence, age, and so forth. A variable is extraneous only when it can be assumed (or shown) to influence the dependent variable. If included in a regression, it can improve the fit of the model. If it is excluded from the regression and if it has a non-zero covariance with one or more of the independent variables of interest, its omission will bias the regression&#x27;s result for the effect of that independent variable of interest. This effect is called confounding or omitted variable bias; in these situations, design changes and/or controlling for a variable statistical control is necessary.

Extraneous variables are often classified into three types:
# Subject variables, which are the characteristics of the individuals being studied that might affect their actions. These variables include age, gender, health status, mood, background, etc.
# Blocking variables or experimental variables are characteristics of the persons conducting the experiment which might influence how a person behaves. Gender, the presence of racial discrimination, language, or other factors may qualify as such variables.
# Situational variables are features of the environment in which the study or research was conducted, which have a bearing on the outcome of the experiment in a negative way. Included are the air temperature, level of activity, lighting, and time of day.

In modelling, variability that is not covered by the independent variable is designated by formula_2 and is known as the &quot;residual&quot;, &quot;side effect&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, &quot;unexplained share&quot;, &quot;residual variable&quot;, &quot;disturbance&quot;, or &quot;tolerance&quot;.

==Examples==
* Effect of fertilizer on plant growths:
: In a study measuring the influence of different quantities of fertilizer on plant growth, the independent variable would be the amount of fertilizer used. The dependent variable would be the growth in height or mass of the plant. The controlled variables would be the type of plant, the type of fertilizer, the amount of sunlight the plant gets, the size of the pots, etc.
* Effect of drug dosage on symptom severity:
: In a study of how different doses of a drug affect the severity of symptoms, a researcher could compare the frequency and intensity of symptoms when different doses are administered. Here the independent variable is the dose and the dependent variable is the frequency/intensity of symptoms.
* Effect of temperature on pigmentation:
: In measuring the amount of color removed from beetroot samples at different temperatures, temperature is the independent variable and amount of pigment removed is the dependent variable.
* Effect of sugar added in a coffee:
: The taste varies with the amount of sugar added in the coffee. Here, the sugar is the independent variable, while the taste is the dependent variable.

<text>Lyle Pearce Lovett (born November 1, 1957) is an American country singer and actor. Active since 1980, he has recorded 14 albums and released 25 singles to date, including his highest entry, the number 10 chart hit on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart, &quot;Cowboy Man&quot;. Lovett has won four Grammy Awards, including Best Male Country Vocal Performance and Best Country Album. His most recent album is &quot;12th of June&quot;, released in 2022.

==Early life==
Lovett was born in Houston; he and his family lived in the nearby community of Klein. He is the son of William Pearce and Bernell Louise (née Klein) Lovett, a marketing executive and training specialist, respectively. Lyle grew up in the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. He graduated from Texas A&amp;M University with Bachelor of Arts degrees in German and journalism in 1980. In the early 1980s, he often played solo acoustic sets at the small bars just off the A&amp;M campus.

==Career==
Lyle Lovett began his music career as a singer-songwriter. By the early 1980s, Lovett had already distinguished himself in the burgeoning Texas folk acoustic scene. He had performed in the New Folk competition at the Kerrville Folk Festival in 1980 and 1982. An American singer, Buffalo Wayne, whom he had met in 1978 during a college trip to Germany, invited Lovett to play with him at the 1983 Schueberfouer in Luxembourg. One of the events (a happening) at the funfair was held at an American musical tent. The owner was a fan of the house band J. David Sloan and the Rogues, which was from Phoenix. He invited the Rogues to perform the event, and Lovett was encouraged by band members Ray Herndon and Matt Rollings to sit in with the group, which performed some of his songs. The experience opened his eyes to what his songs could sound like with proper backing; Lovett had never sung with a band before. Sloan and band member Billy Williams offered Lovett a deal on studio time, first day free. In 1984 Lovett took them up on the offer. After several stays in Arizona over that summer he recorded 18 songs. The demo tape of the first four songs led to his first record deal; ten of the songs recorded with the Rogues became Lovett&#x27;s self-titled debut album. He made many longtime contacts in Phoenix during that time. Some of the Rogues players including Herndon, Matt McKenzie, Rollings, and Williams played in Lovett&#x27;s band. Williams produced or co-produced several of his albums from 1987 to 2007. Through the Rogues he met Francine Reed, who began recording with him in 1985 and toured with him for decades. In 2022, reliving his Phoenix connection he said,It led to a demo tape, an album and now, this rolling Thanksgiving tour... It&#x27;s all because of running into this band in Luxembourg. That&#x27;s a long way to get to Phoenix from Texas. It&#x27;s a lot shorter if you just do I-10.

He signed with MCA Records in 1986 and released his eponymous debut album. He sang harmony vocals on Nanci Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the True Believers&quot; album (1986). While typically associated with the country genre, Lovett&#x27;s compositions often incorporate folk, swing, blues, jazz and gospel music as well as more traditional country &amp; western styling. He has won four Grammy Awards, including Best Country Album (1996 for &quot;The Road to Ensenada&quot;), Best Country Duo/Group with Vocal (1994 for &quot;Blues For Dixie&quot; with the Texas swing group Asleep at the Wheel), Best Pop Vocal Collaboration (1994 for &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot; with Al Green) and Best Country Male Vocal (1989 for &quot;Lyle Lovett and His Large Band&quot;). In 1995, Lovett performed a duet of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend in Me&quot; with Randy Newman for &quot;Toy Story&quot;. He plays Collings acoustic guitars.
Lovett acted in a number of films, notably four for director Robert Altman: &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; (1994), and &quot;Cookie&#x27;s Fortune&quot; (1999). He also composed the score for the director&#x27;s &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot; (2000). Some of his other film roles include &quot;Bastard Out Of Carolina&quot; (1996), &quot;The New Guy&quot; (2002), &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot; (2007), and a humorous role in &quot;Angels Sing&quot;, a family Christmas movie (alongside fellow actors and musicians such as Harry Connick, Jr., Connie Britton, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson). His television acting forays include guest roles on &quot;Mad About You&quot; and &quot;Castle&quot;, a recurring role on &quot;The Bridge&quot; (as Flagman, a lawyer), and appearances as himself on &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; and &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;.

Mary Chapin Carpenter&#x27;s 1992 song &quot;I Feel Lucky&quot; makes reference to Lovett, as does Bloodhound Gang&#x27;s 1999 song &quot;The Bad Touch&quot;, which includes the lyric, &quot;and you&#x27;ll Lovett just like Lyle.&quot;

Lovett was given an award called an &quot;Esky&quot; for Surest Thing in Esquire&#x27;s 2006 Esky Music Awards in the April issue. The magazine said of Lovett: &quot;The secret of Lyle Lovett&#x27;s endurance comes down to the three C&#x27;s: class, charisma and consistency... In the studio and on stage with his giant orchestra, he&#x27;s spent two decades gracefully matching genuine songcraft with A-list musicianship&quot;. In 2010, Lovett appeared on an episode of &quot;&quot; that also featured John Prine and Ray LaMontagne. In 2011, Lovett was named &quot;Texas State Artist Musician &quot;by the Texas Commission on the Arts. Lovett contributed a cover of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Well... All Right&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Listen to Me: Buddy Holly&quot;, released on September 6, 2011.

On October 24, 2019, Lovett was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame. In 2022, he released his first album since 2012, &quot;12th of June&quot;. Lyle Lovett is featured in &quot;Foreword: A Conversation with the Indigo Girls, Kathy Mattea, and Lyle Lovett&quot; in Brian T. Atkinson&#x27;s &quot;Love at the Five and Dime: The Songwriting Legacy of Nanci Griffith&quot;.

==Personal life==

Lovett married actress Julia Roberts after meeting her on the set of &quot;The Player&quot;. Following a three-week romance, they eloped and married in June 1993 in Marion, Indiana. In March 1995, they divorced after less than two years of marriage. &quot;People&quot; magazine reported that the breakup was caused by career demands. They remained friends afterwards. 

Lovett became engaged to American film and music producer April Kimble in 2003; they married in 2017. The couple&#x27;s twin son and daughter were born June 12, 2017, a date Lovett chose for the title in his 2022 album &quot;12th of June&quot;. On this album, the song “Her Loving Man” is an ode to his wife. The family&#x27;s home is an East Texas farm, homesteaded by Lovett&#x27;s great-great-grandfather in the early 1850s.

On March 28, 2002, Lovett was trapped by a bull against a fence on his uncle&#x27;s farm in Klein, Texas, before being pulled to safety. He fully recovered after six months from a badly broken leg, and he began touring again in summer 2003.

Lovett was given an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Houston on May 15, 2010, at its general commencement ceremony. His mother was in the audience as her son was presented with an honorary doctorate from the same university from which she had received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1960. His father was also a graduate of the Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture of the University of Houston. In 2015, Lyle received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Texas A&amp;M University.

Lyle Lovett is a horse enthusiast and co-owns and competes in reining competitions with his world class Quarter Horse named Smart And Shiney. In 2012, Lovett was inducted into the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame. In 2018, he was awarded the National Reining Horse Association Lifetime Achievement Award in the National Reining Horse Association Hall of Fame.

<text>HIV-positive people, seropositive people or people who live with HIV are people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a retrovirus which if untreated may progress to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

According to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), 38.4 million people were infected with HIV at the end of 2021. That same year, some 1.5 million people became newly infected, and 650,000 died of AIDS-related causes, including 98,000 children. More than two-thirds of new HIV infections are in sub-Saharan Africa.

== Testing and awareness ==

Infection with HIV is determined by an HIV test. As of 2021, 85% of all people living with HIV knew their status.

The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Amnesty International, the Global Network of Sex Work Projects and the Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS, have all condemned forced HIV testing actions as infringements on human rights and conflicting with proven public health measures that are successful in preventing HIV transmission. Sex workers in Malawi and Greece have been forced to undergo HIV testing and those who tested HIV-positive were criminalized. Stigmatizing measures discourage HIV-positive people from seeking voluntary and confidential counseling, testing and treatment.

In &quot;Understanding Positive Women&#x27;s Realities,&quot; Emma Bell and Luisa Orza argue HIV and sexual and reproductive health programmes and policies fail to recognize the complexity of HIV-positive people&#x27;s lives and the context in which their sexual and reproductive choices are situated. Services do not prepare people for the consequences of a positive result of an HIV test. In many cases, service users are not taken into account and are forced to undergo an AIDS test without prior consent.

== Gender and diagnosis ==

Diagnosis and gender play corresponding roles in recognizing the lives of those who live with HIV/AIDS. Women have not been diagnosed as early as men because their symptoms were not as obvious and doctors were not as likely to search for the disease in them as they are for men. This has also been based on the fact that far more men than women participated in clinical trials and women were therefore under-represented. Barbara Ogur has pointed out that the stigma of illegal drug use and multiple partners has also led to a lack of care and noticeability for women.

Among the women who were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in the United States in 2009, 64% were Black, 18% were Hispanic, 15% were White, and 1% were Native Alaskan or Native American. Far more women contract the disease through heterosexual contact than men.

== Seronegative conversion ==
As of April 2020, there have been two reported cases of individuals being completely cured of this disease. The first case was Timothy Ray Brown, known as &quot;The Berlin Patient&quot;, who was cured in 2007. The second was Adam Castillejo, known as &quot;The London Patient&quot;, who was cured in March 2020. Both of these patients were cured with stem cell transplants from the bone marrow of a donor who was immune to AIDS due to a genetic mutation. 

Among long-term nonprogressors, those who can maintain very low levels of viral loads, there have been reports of cases of individuals who have undetectable levels. Loreen Willenberg from USA was announced as the first such case in 2019 and in 2021 another case from Argentina dubbed &quot;the Esperanza patient&quot;.

== Organizations ==

Over the years of coping with the stigma and discrimination that accompany the diagnosis in most societies, a large number of support groups have been formed. In these groups, the term most often applied to people who are HIV-positive is &quot;People Living With HIV/AIDS&quot;. This is often abbreviated as &quot;PLWHA&quot; or &quot;PLHIV&quot;. Recently, &quot;People Living Positively&quot; has also been used.

The largest and oldest of the worldwide networks of people infected with HIV is the Global Network of People living with HIV/AIDS (GNP+), which has affiliate networks on every continent.

== Relationship issues ==

For women who are HIV-positive and also in relationships, sexual expression and communication may become an issue of conflict. Their natural human desires of love, trust and intimacy might go unrecognized in programs such as ABC (Abstinence, Being faithful, Condom use) and as a member of the ICW (International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS) stated at the International AIDS conference in 2006 &quot;we need to bring love back into the whole thing.&quot;

Each individual deals with an HIV diagnosis and their post-diagnosis sexual activity in different ways. Some individuals with HIV may decide to practice abstinence, while others may continue to have sex. An ICW member from Zimbabwe stated at a session in Toronto that her &quot;relationship ended, and I spent the next four years celibate,&quot; while an ICW member in the United Kingdom found that she preferred the use of condoms and &quot;in some ways [HIV] has made me more assertive sexually.&quot; It is vital to note that a positive diagnosis of the disease does not only affect illegal drug users or promiscuous individuals and that their basic sexual desires do not fade.

According to Emma Bell and Luisa Orza in &quot;Understanding Positive Women&#x27;s Realities,&quot; there is a need for service providers to understand women&#x27;s relationships impact on their ability to access treatment and other health services. In many cases, HIV-positive realities include husbands or partners who have not or are unwilling to be tested for HIV forcing their HIV-positive spouse into giving them their ARV dose.

== Stigma ==

Stigma attached with the disease makes it particularly harder for children living with HIV and their caregivers. Caregiving goes beyond the child-caregiver dynamic, and is intertwined with the local community and the healthcare and support system structures.

Movies such as &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993), which followed the story of a gay, HIV-positive lawyer played by Tom Hanks, helped counteract stigma towards those living with HIV and made the topic less taboo. As HIV advocate Gary Bell claims: &quot;I remember there was quite a buzz about it. I think the good news was that it got people talking about HIV in a way that they really weren&#x27;t, because HIV was always that thing we really didn&#x27;t want to talk about.&quot;

<doc id="437718" wikidata="Q5336242" url="?curid=437718" title="Eddie Lopat">
<text>Edmund Walter Lopat (originally Lopatynski) (June 21, 1918 – June 15, 1992) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher, coach, manager, front office executive, and scout. He was sometimes known as &quot;the Junk Man&quot;, but better known as &quot;Steady Eddie&quot;, a nickname later given to Eddie Murray. He was born in New York City.

==Playing career==
A , left-hander, Lopat began his playing career in 1937. After seven minor league seasons, he made his major league pitching debut on April 30, 1944, playing for the Chicago White Sox. He was traded to the New York Yankees on February 24, 1948, for Aaron Robinson, Bill Wight, and Fred Bradley. From to he was the third of the &quot;Big Three&quot; of the Yankees&#x27; pitching staff, together with Allie Reynolds and Vic Raschi. He pitched in the All-Star Game in for the American League. In he led the AL in both earned-run average and won/lost percentage.

On July 30, 1955, Lopat was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Jim McDonald and cash, finishing out the season and retiring. Over his 12-year AL career, Lopat won 166 games, losing 112 (.597) with an ERA of 3.21. He was also adept with the bat, compiling a .211 batting average with 5 home runs and 77 runs batted in during his career.

Ned Garver described Lopat&#x27;s pitching style, writing that he &quot;changed speeds a lot and never really threw an exceptional fastball.&quot;

==Coaching career==
Lopat managed the Triple-A Richmond Virginians for the Yankees from 1956 to 1958, compiling a cumulative record of 226–234 with one playoff berth. He then became a roving pitching coach in the Bombers&#x27; farm system in 1959. In , he served one season as the Yankees&#x27; MLB pitching coach during Casey Stengel&#x27;s final campaign as the club&#x27;s manager. That year produced an American League pennant for the Yankees, but a defeat at the hands of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series. Lopat was not rehired by Stengel&#x27;s successor, Ralph Houk, but he stayed in the league as pitching coach of the Minnesota Twins in and the Kansas City Athletics in .

In Lopat was tapped to manage the Athletics and continued in this role until June 11, 1964. His 1963 squad finished in eighth place, registering one more victory than it had in 1962. But his 1964 A&#x27;s were playing only .327 baseball at 17–35 on June 10, when he was replaced by Mel McGaha. His final major league managerial record was 90–124 (.421).

Lopat remained with the Athletics as a senior front office aide to team owner Charlie Finley until the club moved to Oakland after the  season. He then scouted for the Montreal Expos during their early years in Major League Baseball.

===Managerial record===
==Later life==
In 1978, Eddie Lopat was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame He died at his son&#x27;s home in Darien, Connecticut, on June 15, 1992. Lopat pitched for five victorious Yankees teams in the World Series, in 1949–53.

<doc id="437719" wikidata="Q991293" url="?curid=437719" title="Web cache">
<text>A Web cache (or HTTP cache) is a system for optimizing the World Wide Web. It is implemented both client-side and server-side. The caching of multimedia and other files can result in less overall delay when browsing the Web.

==Parts of the system==

===Forward and reverse===
A forward cache is a cache outside the web server&#x27;s network, e.g. in the client&#x27;s web browser, in an ISP, or within a corporate network. A network-aware forward cache only caches heavily accessed items. A proxy server sitting between the client and web server can evaluate HTTP headers and choose whether to store web content.

A reverse cache sits in front of one or more web servers, accelerating requests from the Internet and reducing peak server load. This is usually a content delivery network (CDN) that retains copies of web content at various points throughout a network.

===HTTP options===
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) defines three basic mechanisms for controlling caches: freshness, validation, and invalidation. This is specified in the header of HTTP response messages from the server.

Freshness allows a response to be used without re-checking it on the origin server, and can be controlled by both the server and the client. For example, the Expires response header gives a date when the document becomes stale, and the Cache-Control: max-age directive tells the cache how many seconds the response is fresh for.

Validation can be used to check whether a cached response is still good after it becomes stale. For example, if the response has a Last-Modified header, a cache can make a &quot;conditional request&quot; using the If-Modified-Since header to see if it has changed. The ETag (entity tag) mechanism also allows for both strong and weak validation.

Invalidation is usually a side effect of another request that passes through the cache. For example, if a URL associated with a cached response subsequently gets a POST, PUT or DELETE request, the cached response will be invalidated.
Many CDNs and manufacturers of network equipment have replaced this standard HTTP cache control with dynamic caching.

==Legality==
In 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act added rules to the United States Code (17 U.S.C. §: 512) that exempts system operators from copyright liability for the purposes of caching.

<doc id="437720" wikidata="Q306661" url="?curid=437720" title="Memcached">
<text>Memcached (pronounced variously /mɛmkæʃˈdiː/ &quot;mem-cash-dee&quot; or /ˈmɛmkæʃt/ &quot;mem-cashed&quot;) is a general-purpose distributed memory-caching system. It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of times an external data source (such as a database or API) must be read. Memcached is free and open-source software, licensed under the Revised BSD license. Memcached runs on Unix-like operating systems (Linux and macOS) and on Microsoft Windows. It depends on the libevent library.

Memcached&#x27;s APIs provide a very large hash table distributed across multiple machines. When the table is full, subsequent inserts cause older data to be purged in least recently used (LRU) order. Applications using Memcached typically layer requests and additions into RAM before falling back on a slower backing store, such as a database.

Memcached has no internal mechanism to track misses which may happen. However, some third party utilities provide this functionality.

Memcached was first developed by Brad Fitzpatrick for his website LiveJournal, on May 22, 2003. It was originally written in Perl, then later rewritten in C by Anatoly Vorobey, then employed by LiveJournal. Memcached is now used by many other systems, including YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Wikipedia, and Method Studios. Google App Engine, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, IBM Bluemix and Amazon Web Services also offer a Memcached service through an API.

==Software architecture==

The system uses a client–server architecture. The servers maintain a key–value associative array; the clients populate this array and query it by key. Keys are up to 250 bytes long and values can be at most 1 megabyte in size.

Clients use client-side libraries to contact the servers which, by default, expose their service at port 11211. Both TCP and UDP are supported. Each client knows all servers; the servers do not communicate with each other. If a client wishes to set or read the value corresponding to a certain key, the client&#x27;s library first computes a hash of the key to determine which server to use. This gives a simple form of sharding and scalable shared-nothing architecture across the servers. The server computes a second hash of the key to determine where to store or read the corresponding value. The servers keep the values in RAM (and, starting in 1.6.0, in auxiliary cache on disk using an external storage server option); if a server runs out of available memory or disk, it discards the oldest values. Therefore, clients must treat Memcached as a transitory cache; they cannot assume that data stored in Memcached is still there when they need it. Other databases, such as MemcacheDB, Couchbase Server, provide persistent storage while maintaining Memcached protocol compatibility.

If all client libraries use the same hashing algorithm to determine servers, then clients can read each other&#x27;s cached data.

A typical deployment has several servers and many clients. However, it is possible to use Memcached on a single computer, acting simultaneously as client and server. The size of its hash table is often very large. It is limited to available memory across all the servers in the cluster of servers in a data center. Where high-volume, wide-audience Web publishing requires it, this may stretch to many gigabytes. Memcached can be equally valuable for situations where either the number of requests for content is high, or the cost of generating a particular piece of content is high. Applications with particularly high-demand caching needs can use a built-in proxy to define and configure complex client-server routes.

===Security===
Most deployments of Memcached are within trusted networks where clients may freely connect to any server. However, sometimes Memcached is deployed in untrusted networks or where administrators want to exercise control over the clients that are connecting. For this purpose Memcached can be compiled with optional SASL authentication support. The SASL support requires the binary protocol.

A presentation at BlackHat USA 2010 revealed that a number of large public websites had left Memcached open to inspection, analysis, retrieval, and modification of data.

Even within a trusted organisation, the flat trust model of memcached may have security implications. For efficient simplicity, all Memcached operations are treated equally. Clients with a valid need for access to low-security entries within the cache gain access to &quot;all&quot; entries within the cache, even when these are higher-security and that client has no justifiable need for them. If the cache key can be either predicted, guessed or found by exhaustive searching, its cache entry may be retrieved.

Some attempt to isolate setting and reading data may be made in situations such as high volume web publishing. A farm of outward-facing content servers have &quot;read&quot; access to memcached containing published pages or page components, but no write access. Where new content is published (and is not yet in memcached), a request is instead sent to content generation servers that are not publicly accessible to create the content unit and add it to memcached.

In February 2018, CloudFlare reported that misconfigured memcached servers were used to launch DDoS attacks in large scale. The memcached protocol over UDP has a huge amplification factor, of more than 51000. Victims of the DDoS attacks include GitHub, which was flooded with 1.35 Tbit/s peak incoming traffic.

This issue was mitigated in Memcached version 1.5.6, which disabled UDP protocol by default.

==Example code==
&quot;Note that all functions described on this page are pseudocode only. Memcached calls and programming languages may vary based on the API used.&quot;

Converting database or object creation queries to use Memcached is simple. Typically, when using straight database queries, example code would be as follows:
 function get_foo(int userid)
 data = db_select(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE userid = ?&quot;, userid)
 return data
After conversion to Memcached, the same call might look like the following

 function get_foo(int userid)
 /* first try the cache */
 data = memcached_fetch(&quot;userrow:&quot; + userid)
 if not data
 /* not found : request database */
 data = db_select(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE userid = ?&quot;, userid)
 /* then store in cache until next get */
 memcached_add(&quot;userrow:&quot; + userid, data)
 end

 return data
The client would first check whether a Memcached value with the unique key &quot;userrow:userid&quot; exists, where userid is some number. If the result does not exist, it would select from the database as usual, and set the unique key using the Memcached API add function call.

However, if only this API call were modified, the server would end up fetching incorrect data following any database update actions: the Memcached &quot;view&quot; of the data would become out of date. Therefore, in addition to creating an &quot;add&quot; call, an update call would also be needed using the Memcached set function.

 function update_foo(int userid, string dbUpdateString)
 /* first update database */
 result = db_execute(dbUpdateString)
 if result
 /* database update successful : fetch data to be stored in cache */
 data = db_select(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE userid = ?&quot;, userid)
 /* the previous line could also look like data = createDataFromDBString(dbUpdateString) */
 /* then store in cache until next get */
 memcached_set(&quot;userrow:&quot; + userid, data)

This call would update the currently cached data to match the new data in the database, assuming the database query succeeds. An alternative approach would be to invalidate the cache with the Memcached delete function, so that subsequent fetches result in a cache miss. Similar action would need to be taken when database records were deleted, to maintain either a correct or incomplete cache.

An alternate cache-invalidation strategy is to store a random number in an agreed-upon cache entry and to incorporate this number into all keys that are used to store a particular kind of entry. To invalidate all such entries at once, change the random number. Existing entries (which were stored using the old number) will no longer be referenced and so will eventually expire or be recycled.
 function store_xyz_entry(int key, string value)
 /* Retrieve the random number - use zero if none exists yet.
 * The key-name used here is arbitrary. */ 
 seed = memcached_fetch(&quot;:xyz_seed:&quot;)
 if not seed
 seed = 0
 /* Build the key used to store the entry and store it.
 * The key-name used here is also arbitrary. Notice that the &quot;seed&quot; and the user&#x27;s &quot;key&quot;
 * are stored as separate parts of the constructed hashKey string: &quot;:xyz_data:(seed):(key).&quot; 
 * This is not mandatory, but is recommended. */
 string hashKey = sprintf(&quot;:xyz_data:%d:%d&quot;, seed, key)
 memcached_set(hashKey, value)

 /* &quot;fetch_entry,&quot; not shown, follows identical logic to the above. */

 function invalidate_xyz_cache()
 existing_seed = memcached_fetch(&quot;:xyz_seed:&quot;)
 /* Coin a different random seed */
 do
 seed = rand()
 until seed != existing_seed
 /* Now store it in the agreed-upon place. All future requests will use this number. 
 * Therefore, all existing entries become un-referenced and will eventually expire. */
 memcached_set(&quot;:xyz_seed:&quot;, seed)

<text>Harold Lloyd Jenkins (September 1, 1933 – June 5, 1993), better known by his stage name Conway Twitty, was an American singer and songwriter. Initially a part of the 1950s rockabilly scene, Twitty was best known as a country music performer. From 1971 to 1976, Twitty received a string of Country Music Association awards for duets with Loretta Lynn. He was inducted into both the Country Music and Rockabilly Halls of Fame.

Twitty was known for his frequent use of romantic and sentimental themes in his songs. Due to his following being compared to a religious revival, comedian Jerry Clower nicknamed Twitty &quot;The High Priest of Country Music&quot;, the eventual title of his 33rd studio album. Twitty achieved stardom with hit songs like &quot;Hello Darlin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Never Been This Far Before&quot; and &quot;Linda on My Mind&quot;. Twitty topped &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot;&quot; Hot Country Songs chart 40 times in his career, a record that stood for two decades until it was surpassed by George Strait, and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart once with &quot;It&#x27;s Only Make Believe&quot;. He wrote eleven of his &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart-topping hits.

==Early life==
Twitty was born Harold Lloyd Jenkins on September 1, 1933, in Friars Point, Mississippi. The Jenkins family were of Welsh descent. He was named by his great-uncle, after his favorite silent movie actor Harold Lloyd. The Jenkins family moved to Helena, Arkansas, when Jenkins was 10 years old. In Helena, Jenkins performed on radio when he was 10, and he formed his first singing group, the Phillips County Ramblers when he was 12, and they had their own show on the local radio station KFFA every Saturday morning. He preached at church revivals when he was a teenager.

Twitty was a baseball player with a batting average of .450 when he graduated from high school, and he was offered a contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. He worked for a few months for International Harvester before accepting the Phillies offer. However, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in the Far East, during which time he organized a group called the Cimmarons to entertain his fellow soldiers. The Phillies renewed their offer when he returned home, but Twitty had by now become more interested in pursuing a music career.

Soon after hearing Elvis Presley&#x27;s song &quot;Mystery Train&quot;, Jenkins began writing rock &amp; roll material. Elvis was a strong influence and Jenkins tried to sound like him. He formed a band called The Rockhousers and wrote a song called &quot;Rockhouse&quot;. He went to the Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, a few times to record with Sam Phillips, the owner and founder. Although he performed alongside Presley and other rock &amp; roll pioneers throughout this period in a regional club scene situated within a 300-mile radius of Memphis, Tennessee, Twitty expressed a fundamental ambivalence toward Phillips&#x27; rhythm and blues-based house production style in an interview for Tony Palmer&#x27;s &quot;All You Need Is Love: The Story of Popular Music&quot; (1976), noting that the producer&#x27;s musical instincts subordinated many elements of Twitty&#x27;s bluegrass music-influenced style.

None of Jenkins&#x27;s Sun recordings were released at the time, but Roy Orbison did record his composition &quot;Rockhouse&quot; (given to Orbison by Phillips without Jenkins&#x27;s approval), which was issued on SUN 251 (flipside &quot;You&#x27;re My Baby&quot;) in 1956.

==Career==
===Stage name===
A member of Cimmarons suggested Don Seat as a manager for Jenkins, and Seat indicated to Jenkins that he needed a name with star quality. Jenkins then adopted a stage name in 1957. In &quot;The Billboard Book of Number One Hits&quot;, Fred Bronson states that the singer named himself after two towns on a map; Conway, Arkansas, and Twitty, Texas, and chose the name Conway Twitty. Twitty himself confirmed this while appearing on the &quot;David Letterman Show&quot; on March 30, 1989. His manager Don Seat, however, said that his girlfriend came up with the name long before Jenkins used it. After Twitty had some success with rock and roll songs, he had considered using his original name Harold Jenkins for his country music releases, while keeping the name Conway Twitty for his rock and roll songs, but he abandoned rock for country in 1965 and kept his stage name.

In 1957, under his new name, he recorded briefly for Mercury Records, releasing two unsuccessful singles, &quot;I Need Your Lovin&#x27;&quot;/&quot;Born to Sing the Blues&quot; and &quot;Shake It Up&quot;/&quot;Maybe Baby&quot;. &quot;I Need Your Lovin&#x27;&quot; reached only No. 93. Although he recorded three more songs with Mercury, his contract was soon terminated.

===Rock and roll career===
In 1958, Twitty&#x27;s fortunes improved when an Ohio radio station had an inspiration, refraining from playing &quot;I&#x27;ll Try&quot; (an MGM single that went nowhere in terms of sales, radio play, and jukebox play), instead playing the B-side, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Make Believe&quot;, a song written between sets by Twitty and drummer Jack Nance when they were in Hamilton, Ontario, playing at the Flamingo Lounge. The record took several months to reach and stay at the top spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop music charts in the United States and number 1 in 21 other countries, becoming the first of nine top-40 hits for Twitty. It sold over four million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. That same year, country singer Tabby West of ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; heard Twitty and booked him to appear on the show.

When &quot;It&#x27;s Only Make Believe&quot; was first released, because of vocal similarities, many listeners assumed that the song was actually recorded by Elvis Presley, using &quot;Conway Twitty&quot; as a pseudonym. Twitty would go on to enjoy rock-and-roll success with songs including &quot;Danny Boy&quot; (Pop number 10) and &quot;Lonely Blue Boy&quot; (Pop number 6). &quot;Lonely Blue Boy&quot;, originally titled &quot;Danny&quot;, was recorded by Presley for the film &quot;King Creole&quot; but was not used in the soundtrack. This song led to him naming his band the Lonely Blue Boys. They subsequently became the Twitty Birds. As his recording career continued, Twitty&#x27;s music shifted from rockabilly to rock and roll, and Twitty also recorded some R&amp;B and blues singles.

By 1965, Twitty had become disillusioned with rock &amp; roll, particularly with the behavior of the fans, and walked out of a show in the middle of a performance in New Jersey. He sued his manager to be released from his contract, and moved to perform country music in Oklahoma City.

===Country music career===
Twitty always wanted to record country music, and, beginning in 1965, he did just that. Disc jockeys on some country-music radio stations refused to play his first few country albums, because he was known as a rock and roll singer. However, he had his first top-five country hit, &quot;The Image of Me&quot;, in July 1968, followed by his first number one country song, &quot;Next in Line&quot;, in November 1968. Few of his singles beginning in 1968 ranked below the top five.

In 1970, Twitty recorded and released his biggest country hit, &quot;Hello Darlin&#x27;&quot;, which spent four weeks at the top of the country chart and is one of Twitty&#x27;s most recognized songs. In 1971, he released his first hit duet with Loretta Lynn, &quot;After the Fire Is Gone&quot;. It was a success, and many more followed, including &quot;Lead Me On&quot; (1971), &quot;Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man&quot; (1973), &quot;As Soon As I Hang Up the Phone&quot; (1974), &quot;Feelins&#x27;&quot; (1975), &quot;I Still Believe in Waltzes&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Love You Enough&quot;, and many others. Together, Conway and Loretta (as they were known in their act) won four consecutive Country Music Association awards for vocal duo (1972–1975) and a host of other duo and duet awards from other organizations throughout the 1970s.

In 1973, Twitty released &quot;You&#x27;ve Never Been This Far Before&quot;, which was number 1 in country for three weeks that September and also reached number 22 on the pop charts. Some more conservative disc jockeys refused to play the song, believing that some of the lyrics were too sexually suggestive.

In 1978, Twitty issued the single &quot;The Grandest Lady of Them All&quot; honoring the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. (Somewhat ironically, Twitty was never inducted into the &quot;Opry&quot; during his lifetime; he remains one of the more prominent Nashville country artists never to have been an Opry member.) The single reached the top 20, peaking at number 16, but it was well below expectations; it was the first time since 1967 that a single of his failed to reach the top ten, as some radio stations refused to play a song honoring the property of a competitor (broadcast by WSM-AM).

Twitty soon renewed his image with a new hairstyle, changing from the slicked-back pompadour style to the curlier style he would keep for the rest of his life; by the late 1970s, Twitty had shifted his musical arrangements into a country pop style he would maintain for the rest of his career. His next 23 consecutive singles all made it into the top 10, with 13 reaching number one, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Take It Away&quot;, &quot;I May Never Get to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Happy Birthday Darlin&#x27;&quot;, and remakes of major pop hits such as &quot;The Rose&quot;, &quot;Slow Hand&quot; and &quot;Tight Fittin&#x27; Jeans&quot;, a song written by Michael Huffman, released in June 1981 as the first single from the album &quot;Mr. T&quot;. The song was Twitty&#x27;s 26th number one on the country chart. The single stayed at number one for one week and spent a total of 10 weeks on the country chart. In 1985, going by all weekly music trade charts, the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Him a Cowboy&quot; became the 50th single of his career to achieve a number-one ranking. He would have six more through 1991, giving him a total of 56 number-one hits. George Strait matched the feat of 50 number-one hits in 2002 with his single &quot;She&#x27;ll Leave You with a Smile&quot; and then reached number 1 for the 56th time in 2007, when the single &quot;Wrapped&quot; hit the top on the Media Base 24/7 list.

Throughout much of Twitty&#x27;s country music career his recording home was Decca Records, later renamed MCA. He signed with the label in late 1965 but left in 1981, when it appeared MCA was marketing and promoting newer acts; management at the label had changed, in addition to other factors that brought on the decision. He joined Elektra/Asylum in 1982. That label&#x27;s country music unit merged with sister label Warner Bros. Records in 1983. He stayed with Warner Bros. through early 1987 but then went back to MCA to finish his career. In 1993, shortly before he died, he recorded a new album, &quot;Final Touches&quot;.

===Films===
Twitty had a short career in films, appearing in a few B-movies in 1960 in which he acted and sang, starting with &quot;Platinum High School&quot;, followed by &quot;College Confidential&quot; and &quot;Sex Kittens Go to College&quot;.

===Baseball===

Twitty also played baseball, his second passion. He received an offer to play with the Philadelphia Phillies after high school, but he was drafted into the U.S. Army before he could sign the contract. Twitty joined the entrepreneur Larry Schmittou and other country musicians, such as Cal Smith and Jerry Reed in 1977 as investors in the Nashville Sounds, a Minor League Baseball team of the Double-A Southern League, which began playing in 1978. Twitty threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the team&#x27;s inaugural home opener at Herschel Greer Stadium on April 26, 1978. Twitty would also host celebrity softball games for charity, frequently playing against a team put together by Barbara Mandrell.

===Twitty City===
Twitty lived for many years in Hendersonville, Tennessee, just north of Nashville, Tennessee, where he built a country music entertainment complex named Twitty City at a cost of over $3.5 million. Twitty and Twitty City were once featured on the TV series &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, and were also seen in the Nashville episode of the BBC series &quot;Entertainment USA&quot;, presented by Jonathan King. Opened in 1982, Twitty City was a popular tourist stop throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s; it was shut down in 1994 following a year-long tribute show called Final Touches, when fans and peers in the music business dropped by. The complex was auctioned off and bought by the Trinity Broadcasting Network in June 1994.

==Personal life==
Twitty was married four times, to three different women. His first marriage, to Ellen Matthews, lasted from 1953 to 1954. They had married because Ellen was pregnant with their son, Michael. His second, and longest, marriage was to Temple &quot;Mickey&quot; Medley. They were married in 1956 and had three children: Kathy, Joni Lee, and Jimmy Twitty. The couple were divorced in early 1970, but they remarried quietly by the end of 1970. By 1984, after 28 years of marriage on and off, the stress of Twitty&#x27;s frequent absences took its toll on Mickey, and she and Conway divorced. Mickey Twitty died in 2021. In 1987, Twitty married his 36-year-old office secretary, Delores &quot;Dee&quot; Henry, who became his widow in June 1993.

Twitty made Oklahoma City his home during most of his recording career, from 1963 to 1972. He also lived in Norman, Oklahoma. Twitty performed at the Diamond Ballroom after its opening in 1964. Conway Twitty opened one of his Twitty Burger restaurants at 7200 S. Western Avenue in Oklahoma City.

In 1981, Twitty was exiting his tour bus when he slipped on the steps and fell, hitting his head against the steps. John Hughey, who was Twitty&#x27;s steel guitar player, found him on the ground. Many people, including family members, said that Twitty underwent a change in personality after the accident.

Twitty served on the board of directors of CMT (Country Music Television) from 1984 to 1988, after Music Village Group (Nyhl Henson, Gilbert Biggers, Hall Hardaway Jr. and Benny and Dean Jaggers) acquired CMTV from Glen Daniels. (Inheriting a copyright infringement suit from Viacom, owner of MTV, settled for an undisclosed sum.) The Music Village Group, built Music Village USA adjacent to Twitty City including a state-of-the-art 1,776-seat theatre where CMT uplinked its 24-hour programming and produced live concerts. When Music Village and Twitty was sold in 1989 and CMT in 1990, Conway turned his attention to the burgeoning Branson market playing to sell-out crowds. Twitty teamed up again with Nyhl Henson and his team to anchor the new musical home of Conway Twitty and inked the deal the day before his death in June 1993.

===Death===
On June 4, 1993, Twitty became ill while performing at the Jim Stafford Theatre in Branson, Missouri. He collapsed on his tour bus after the show and was rushed to a hospital. He was rushed into surgery, but died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, in the early hours of the following morning at Cox South Hospital in Springfield, Missouri, at the age of 59. Loretta Lynn, who frequently was his chart-making duet partner, was at the hospital because her husband, Mooney, a.k.a. Doo, was recovering from heart surgery, and saw Twitty briefly as he entered the hospital. His last studio album, &quot;Final Touches&quot;, was released two months later. Four months after Twitty&#x27;s death, George Jones included a cover version of &quot;Hello Darlin&#x27;&quot; on his album &quot;High-Tech Redneck&quot;.

Twitty was buried at Sumner Memorial Gardens in Gallatin, Tennessee, in a red granite vault under his birth name Harold L. Jenkins. There are spaces reserved next to him for his wife and his son Michael.

===Estate lawsuits===
After Twitty&#x27;s death, his estate became entangled in a lengthy court saga between the estate and family members, heirs, employees and others that lasted over a decade. In one instance, the estate sued his two daughters, claiming loans were due to be repaid. Five years after his death, The Tennessee Appeals Court referred to that case in its opening sentence with, &quot;This is yet another chapter in the administration of the estate of Harold L. Jenkins, a popular entertainer whose stage name was &#x27;Conway Twitty.&#x27;&quot; The court sided with the daughters finding that the accountants and controllers of Twitty&#x27;s books while he was alive, who later became the executors of the estate, kept &quot;limited and sketchy information&quot; when it came to the family members. In other instances, employees sued because of oral promises &quot;to be taken care of&quot; by Twitty and often were successful. The court found Twitty rarely, if ever, memorialized contracts with family members, contractors and employees in writing. Oral promises included bonuses of $1000 per year of employment. The estate attempted to reduce that to $100 per year.

==Posthumous releases==
Since his death, Twitty&#x27;s son Michael and grandson Tre have been carrying on his musical legacy. Conway&#x27;s most recent appearance on the country charts was a duet with Anita Cochran, &quot;(I Want to Hear) A Cheating Song&quot; (2004), which was made possible by splicing Twitty&#x27;s vocal from old recordings and interviews, recorded over the years. As a result, Twitty&#x27;s isolated vocal track was transferred to a digital multitrack and digitally reassembled into the new performance. Like the electronic duets of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves, Hank Williams and Hank Williams Jr., or Nat King Cole and Natalie Cole, Cochran added her vocal to backing tracks that had already been produced along with Twitty&#x27;s reconstructed vocals.

Currently, Bear Family Records offers the single-disc collection &quot;Conway Rocks&quot;, featuring 30 songs, and &quot;The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Years&quot;, a comprehensive eight-disc box set showcasing his complete early recordings as a rock artist.

==Legal issues==
===Taxes===
Twitty&#x27;s success in country music was a key factor in his winning the 1983 case &quot;Harold L. Jenkins (a/k/a Conway Twitty) v. Commissioner&quot; in United States Tax Court. The Internal Revenue Service allowed Twitty to deduct from his taxes, as an &quot;ordinary and necessary&quot; business expense, payments that he had made to repay investors in a defunct fast-food chain called Twitty Burger; the chain disestablished in 1971. The general rule is that the payment of someone else&#x27;s debts is not deductible. Twitty alleged that his primary motive was &quot;protecting his personal business reputation.&quot; The court opinion contained testimony from Twitty about his bond with country music fans. The Tax Court ruled in Twitty&#x27;s favor and allowed him to deduct these repayments.

===Estate===
Twitty married four times (twice to Mickey). His widow in 1993, Delores &quot;Dee&quot; Henry Jenkins, and his four grown children from the previous marriages, Michael, Joni, Kathy and Jimmy Jenkins, engaged in a public dispute over the estate. Twitty&#x27;s will had not been updated to account for the fourth marriage, but Tennessee law reserves one third of any estate to the widow. After years of probate, the four children received the rights to Twitty&#x27;s music, name and image. The rest of the estate went to public auction, where much of the property and memorabilia was sold after his widow rejected the appraised value.

In 2008, controversy again erupted in his family when the four remaining children sued Sony/ATV Music Publishing over an agreement that Twitty and his family signed in 1990. The suit alleged that the terms of the agreement were not fully understood by the children, although they were all adults at the time. It sought to recover copyrights and royalty revenue that the document assigned to the company.

==In popular culture==
* The fictional character &#x27;Conrad Birdie&#x27; in the musical and movie &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; is said to be a composite of Twitty and Elvis Presley. The part was written with Twitty in mind but, after deciding to concentrate on music rather than film or theatre, he declined the role.
* Peter Sellers&#x27;s 1959 comedy album &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Sellers&quot; included a character &quot;Twit Conway&quot;, who was a rock singer.
* The animated TV series &quot;Family Guy&quot; has used several cutaways to various performances by Twitty as non sequitur transitions to provide a diversion for Peter Griffin, or as a counter to a controversial theme. The cutaway almost always begins with: &quot;ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Conway Twitty!&quot;
* On April 1, 2020, comedian Gus Johnson released a cover of Conway&#x27;s entire &#x27;Greatest Hits&#x27; album.
* On August 10, 2024, YouTube channel &quot;There I Ruined It&quot; posted a mashup of 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;In Da Club&quot; and Twitty&#x27;s &quot;Tight Fittin&#x27; Jeans&quot;. The song was made with artificial intelligence to recreate Twitty&#x27;s voice and quickly garnered popularity. 50 Cent shared the song on his X account saying that &quot;Beyoncé ain&#x27;t got nothing on him&quot; with regards to releasing country music.

<text>A patient is any recipient of health care services that are performed by healthcare professionals. The patient is most often ill or injured and in need of treatment by a physician, nurse, optometrist, dentist, veterinarian, or other health care provider.

==Etymology==
The word originally meant &#x27;one who suffers&#x27;. This English noun comes from the Latin word , the present participle of the deponent verb, , meaning , and akin to the Greek verb ( ) and its cognate noun ().

This language has been construed as meaning that the role of patients is to passively accept and tolerate the suffering and treatments prescribed by the healthcare providers, without engaging in shared decision-making about their care.

==Outpatients and inpatients==
An outpatient (or out-patient) is a patient who attends an outpatient clinic with no plan to stay beyond the duration of the visit. Even if the patient will not be formally admitted with a note as an outpatient, their attendance is still registered, and the provider will usually give a note explaining the reason for the visit, tests, or procedure/surgery, which should include the names and titles of the participating personnel, the patient&#x27;s name and date of birth, signature of informed consent, estimated pre-and post-service time for history and exam (before and after), any anesthesia, medications or future treatment plans needed, and estimated time of discharge absent any (further) complications. Treatment provided in this fashion is called ambulatory care. Sometimes surgery is performed without the need for a formal hospital admission or an overnight stay, and this is called outpatient surgery or day surgery, which has many benefits including lowered healthcare cost, reducing the amount of medication prescribed, and using the physician&#x27;s or surgeon&#x27;s time more efficiently. Outpatient surgery is suited best for more healthy patients undergoing minor or intermediate procedures (limited urinary-tract, eye, or ear, nose, and throat procedures and procedures involving superficial skin and the extremities). More procedures are being performed in a surgeon&#x27;s office, termed &quot;office-based surgery&quot;, rather than in a hospital-based operating room.
An inpatient (or in-patient), on the other hand, is &quot;admitted&quot; to stay in a hospital overnight or for an indeterminate time, usually, several days or weeks, though in some extreme cases, such as with coma or persistent vegetative state, patients can stay in hospitals for years, sometimes until death. Treatment provided in this fashion is called inpatient care. The admission to the hospital involves the production of an admission note. The leaving of the hospital is officially termed &quot;discharge&quot;, and involves a corresponding discharge note, and sometimes an assessment process to consider ongoing needs. In the English National Health Service this may take the form of &quot;Discharge to Assess&quot; - where the assessment takes place after the patient has gone home.

Misdiagnosis is the leading cause of medical error in outpatient facilities. When the U.S. Institute of Medicine&#x27;s groundbreaking 1999 report, &quot;To Err Is Human&quot;, found up to 98,000 hospital patients die from preventable medical errors in the U.S. each year, early efforts focused on inpatient safety. While patient safety efforts have focused on inpatient hospital settings for more than a decade, medical errors are even more likely to happen in a doctor&#x27;s office or outpatient clinic or center.

== Day patient ==
A day patient (or day-patient) is a patient who is using the full range of services of a hospital or clinic but is not expected to stay the night. The term was originally used by psychiatric hospital services using of this patient type to care for people needing support to make the transition from in-patient to out-patient care. However, the term is now also heavily used for people attending hospitals for day surgery.

==Alternative terminology==
Because of concerns such as dignity, human rights and political correctness, the term &quot;patient&quot; is not always used to refer to a person receiving health care. Other terms that are sometimes used include health consumer, healthcare consumer, customer or client. However, such terminology may be offensive to those receiving public health care, as it implies a business relationship.

In veterinary medicine, the client is the owner or guardian of the patient. These may be used by governmental agencies, insurance companies, patient groups, or health care facilities. Individuals who use or have used psychiatric services may alternatively refer to themselves as consumers, users, or survivors.

In nursing homes and assisted living facilities, the term resident is generally used in lieu of &quot;patient&quot;. Similarly, those receiving home health care are called &quot;clients&quot;.

==Patient-centered healthcare==

The doctor–patient relationship has sometimes been characterized as silencing the voice of patients. It is now widely agreed that putting patients at the centre of healthcare by trying to provide a consistent, informative and respectful service to patients will improve both outcomes and patient satisfaction.

When patients are not at the centre of healthcare, when institutional procedures and targets eclipse local concerns, then patient neglect is possible. Incidents, such as the Stafford Hospital scandal, Winterbourne View hospital abuse scandal and the Veterans Health Administration controversy of 2014 have shown the dangers of prioritizing cost control over the patient experience. Investigations into these and other scandals have recommended that healthcare systems put patient experience at the center, and especially that patients themselves are heard loud and clear within health services.

There are many reasons for why health services should listen more to patients. Patients spend more time in healthcare services than regulators or quality controllers, and can recognize problems such as service delays, poor hygiene, and poor conduct. Patients are particularly good at identifying soft problems, such as attitudes, communication, and &#x27;caring neglect&#x27;, that are difficult to capture with institutional monitoring.

One important way in which patients can be placed at the centre of healthcare is for health services to be more open about patient complaints. Each year many hundreds of thousands of patients complain about the care they have received, and these complaints contain valuable information for any health services which want to learn about and improve patient experience.

<doc id="437729" wikidata="Q2915468" url="?curid=437729" title="Operation Balak">
<text>Operation Balak was a smuggling operation, during the founding of Israel in 1948, that purchased arms in Europe to avoid various embargoes and boycotts transferring them to the Yishuv. Of particular note was the delivery of 23 Czechoslovakia-made Avia S-199 fighters, the post-war version of the German Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109.

A former Royal Air Force pilot and gentile named Gordon Levett, who served in World War II, volunteered for the Israel Machal (the overseas volunteer unit) early in 1948 along with a few Jewish pilots (among others the future president Ezer Weizman) from Britain. Brought up in poverty in Sussex, England, Levett had an affinity for the underdog. &quot;Looking back, I have neither failed nor succeeded, the fate of most of us,&quot; Levett reflected later, &quot;but I shall leave the world a better place than when I entered it because I helped found the State of Israel.&quot;

Initially, Levett was regarded with deep suspicion. &quot;Not only was he not a Jew, but Mr. Levett was particularly notable because he was British,&quot; said The New York Times. &quot;To most Israelis at that time, the recently lapsed British mandate in Palestine had been decidedly pro-Arab, and British Government policy was seen as anti-Zionist.&quot;

&quot;Recruited in March 1948 by emissaries in Europe of the Haganah, the Jewish fighting force in Palestine, Mr. Levett was viewed with a healthy dose of suspicion,&quot; noted the Times. &quot;&#x27;In my last interview I was told, &#x27;We&#x27;re quite convinced that you are a British spy, but we&#x27;re going to take you to see what you&#x27;re up to,&#x27;&quot; he recalled.

In June Levett was given the task of flying Avia S-199 fighters, supplied by Czechoslovakia from the Czechoslovak Air Force airfield (code-named Etzion or Zebra by Israelis) near Žatec (seventy-five kilometers west of Prague) to Ekron airfield (formerly RAF Aqir) close to Rehovot now Tel Nof Israeli Air Force Base. The airfield near Žatec had been put at disposal of the Haganah by a new Czechoslovak foreign minister Vladimír Clementis (a prominent Slovak member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia) and was under the command of Yehuda Ben Chorin. Operation Balak lasted three months, during which time Levett managed to airlift tons of arms, ammunition and personnel. During the first ferry flight of 15 aircraft, three were forced to land in Greece due to poor navigation, and were interned.
After a defector revealed the existence of the base code-named &quot;Zebra&quot; in USA, and the US made a representation to the UN to have the base shut down, the operation shifted to the air base close to the Yugoslav town of Nikšić.

The name is a reference to the Balak, king of the Moabites, son of Zippor, whose name is mentioned in Numbers 22:2. By extension, the name came to mean &#x27;Destroyer.&#x27;

<text>Operation Horev was a large-scale offensive against the Egyptian army in the Western Negev towards the end of the Arab–Israeli War in 1948 and 1949. Its objective was to entrap the Egyptian Army in the Gaza Strip. The operation took place from 22 December 1948 to 7 January 1949 and concluded after Britain threatened to intervene unless Israeli troops immediately withdrew from Egyptian territory.

&quot;Horev&quot; refers to Mount Sinai in the Scriptures, where the Israelites encamped for a year (see Exodus 3:1 and Psalms 106:19). It is contemporarily known as &quot;Jebel Musa&quot; (&quot;Mount of Moses&quot; in Arabic).

==Objectives==

The primary objective of the offensive was to engage the Egyptian army units defending al-Auja on the Palestinian-Egyptian border. The major thrust was then directed towards the Egyptian army bases at El-Arish, intending to trap the majority of the Egyptian army in the Gaza Strip.

Commanding the operation was Yigal Alon, and involved five Israeli brigades: The 8th Armoured Brigade, commanded by Yitzhak Sadeh; the Negev Brigade; the Golani Brigade; the Harel Brigade; and the Alexandroni Brigade. They aimed to maintain the siege of the 4,000-strong Egyptian brigade at Faluja. Additionally, the Egyptians had two more brigades in the Gaza area and one near El-Arish across the border.

==Campaign==

On 22 December, a battalion from the Golani Brigade (transported by Shayetet 11) launched a diversionary attack on positions near the Gaza-Rafah road. In preparation for the offensive, the Israeli army had cleared a route through the desert, bypassing defenses on the Beersheba to al-Auja road. The 8th Armoured Brigade attacked al-Auja from this unexpected quarter on 27 December 1948. After 24 hours of combat, the Egyptians surrendered in disarray. Following this victory, Alon anticipated no significant Egyptian defenses west of El-Arish and prepared to seize the entire Sinai peninsula. The Negev Brigade, following the 8th Brigade&#x27;s tanks, crossed the Egyptian border on the night of 28 December and progressed towards El-Arish. By 30 December 1948, they had reached the outskirts of the town&#x27;s airfield, while units from the Harel Brigade moved further west into Sinai. On 29 December, the United Nations Security Council ordered a ceasefire.

==Outcome==

Before achieving his objective, Allon was ordered by Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to withdraw from Egypt immediately due to threats from the British Government of invoking the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Friendship and becoming directly involved. Despite protests, but adhering to Ben-Gurion&#x27;s directive, the Israelis withdrew. On 3 January, they launched an attack on the Egyptian defenses at Rafah, with the same objective of trapping the Egyptian army. After three days of conflict around Rafah, the Egyptian government announced its willingness to enter armistice negotiations on 6 January 1949. On the same day, the Israeli Air Force shot down five RAF Spitfires on patrol in the area, killing two pilots and taking two more prisoners. The British relocated reinforcements to Akaba. Despite protests from the army, Israel accepted the ceasefire on 7 January. 

In the concluding Armistice Agreement, al-Auja was designated a demilitarized zone.

<doc id="437746" wikidata="Q18764" url="?curid=437746" title="Asian palm civet">
<text>The Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), also called common palm civet, toddy cat and musang, is a viverrid native to South and Southeast Asia. Since 2008, it is IUCN Red Listed as Least Concern as it accommodates to a broad range of habitats. It is widely distributed with large populations that in 2008 were thought unlikely to be declining. It is threatened by poaching for the illegal wildlife trade.

== Characteristics ==
The Asian palm civet&#x27;s long, stocky body is covered with coarse, shaggy hair that is usually greyish in colour. It has a white mask across the forehead, a small white patch under each eye, a white spot on each side of the nostrils, and a narrow dark line between the eyes. The muzzle, ears, lower legs, and distal half of the tail are black, with three rows of black markings on the body. Its head-to-body length is about with a long unringed tail. It weighs . Its anal scent glands emit a nauseating secretion as a chemical defense when threatened or upset.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Asian palm civet is widely distributed in South and Southeast Asia, ranging from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka to Thailand, Singapore, Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei Darussalam, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, the Philippines and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Bawean and Siberut.
It usually inhabits primary forests, but also occurs at lower densities in secondary and selectively logged forest.

It was introduced to Irian Jaya, the Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku, and Sulawesi. Its presence in Papua New Guinea is uncertain.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Asian palm civet is thought to lead a solitary lifestyle, except for brief periods during mating. It is both terrestrial and arboreal, showing a nocturnal activity pattern with peaks between late evening until after midnight. It is usually active between dawn and 4:00 in the morning, but less active during nights when the moon is brightest.

Scent marking behaviour and olfactory response to various excretions such as urine, feces, and secretion of the perineal gland differs in males and females. Scent marking by dragging the perineal gland and leaving the secretion on the substrate was most commonly observed in animals of both sexes. The duration of the olfactory response varied and depended both on the sex and excretion type. The palm civet can distinguish animal species, sex, familiar and unfamiliar individuals by the odor of the perineal gland secretion.

===Feeding and diet===
The Asian palm civet is an omnivore feeding foremost on fruits such as berries and pulpy fruits. It thus helps to maintain tropical forest ecosystems via seed dispersal. It eats chiku, mango and rambutan, but also small mammals and insects. It plays an important role in the natural regeneration of &quot;Pinanga kuhlii&quot; and &quot;P. zavana&quot; palms at Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park.

=== Reproduction ===

Due to its solitary and nocturnal habits, little is known about its reproductive processes and behaviour. In March 2010, a pair of palm civets was observed when attempting to mate. The pair copulated on the tree branch for about five minutes. During that period, the male mounted the female 4–5 times. After each mounting, the pair separated for a few moments and repeated the same procedure. After completion of mating, the pair frolicked around for some time, moving from branch to branch on the tree. The animals separated after about six minutes and moved off to different branches and rested there.

==Threats==

Since 2008, the Asian palm civet is IUCN Red Listed as Least Concern. The global population was thought to be large and unlikely to be declining as of 2008. It is threatened by hunting and trapping, in particular in southern China; in some parts of India, some ethnic tribes kill and consume its meat. 
The oil extracted from small pieces of the meat, kept in linseed oil in a closed earthen pot and regularly sunned, is used indigenously as a cure for scabies.

In Indonesia, it is threatened by poaching and the illegal wildlife trade; buyers use it for the production of kopi luwak made from coffee beans digested and excreted by Asian palm civets. They are housed in battery cage systems, which have been criticised on animal welfare grounds.

In some parts of its range, Asian palm civets are hunted for bushmeat and the pet trade.

==Conservation ==
The Asian palm civet is listed on CITES Appendix III. There is a quota in place in Indonesia, precluding trade from certain areas, setting a cap on the number of civets that can be taken from the wild, and allowing only 10% of those removed from the wild to be sold domestically. This quota is largely ignored by hunters and traders and is not enforced by authorities. This species has become popular as a pet in Indonesia in recent years, causing a rise in the numbers found in markets in Java and Bali. The majority of the animals sold as pets originate from the wild. The high numbers of animals seen, lack of adherence to the quota and lack of enforcement of the laws are causes for conservation concern.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
&quot;Viverra hermaphrodita&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Peter Simon Pallas in 1777. It is the nominate subspecies and ranges in Sri Lanka and southern India as far north as the Narbada River.
Several zoological specimens were described between 1820 and 1992:
*&quot;Viverra bondar&quot; by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in 1820 was a specimen from Bengal
*&quot;Viverra musanga&quot; by Stamford Raffles in 1821 was a specimen from Sumatra
*&quot;Viverra musanga, var. javanica&quot; by Thomas Horsfield in 1824 was a specimen from Java
*&quot;Paradoxurus pallasii&quot; by John Edward Gray in 1832 was a specimen from India
*&quot;Paradoxurus philippinensis&quot; by Claude Jourdan in 1837 was a specimen from the Philippines However, a genetic study in 2015 reclassifies it as a separate species.
*&quot;P. h. setosus&quot; by Honoré Jacquinot and Pucheran in 1853
*&quot;P. h. nictitans&quot; by Taylor in 1891 was a specimen from Odisha;
*&quot;P. h. lignicolor&quot; by Gerrit Smith Miller Jr. in 1903
*&quot;P. h. minor&quot; by John Lewis Bonhote in 1903
*&quot;P. h. canescens&quot; by Lyon in 1907
*&quot;P. h. milleri&quot; by Cecil Boden Kloss in 1908

*&quot;P. h. pallens&quot; (Miller, 1913)
*&quot;P. h. parvus&quot; (Miller, 1913)
*&quot;P. h. pugnax&quot; (Miller, 1913)
*&quot;P. h. pulcher&quot; (Miller, 1913)
*&quot;P. h. sacer&quot; (Miller, 1913)
*&quot;P. h. senex&quot; (Miller, 1913)
*&quot;P. h. simplex&quot; (Miller, 1913)
*&quot;P. h. enganus&quot; by Lyon, 1916
*&quot;P. h. laotum&quot; by Nils Carl Gustaf Fersen Gyldenstolpe in 1917 was a specimen from Chieng Hai in north-western Thailand, and ranges from Myanmar to Indochina and Hainan;
*&quot;P. h. balicus&quot; by Sody in 1933 was a specimen from Bali
*&quot;P. h. scindiae&quot; by Pocock in 1934 was a specimen from Gwalior, and ranges in central India;
*&quot;P. h. vellerosus&quot; by Pocock in 1934 was a specimen from Kashmir;
*&quot;P. h. dongfangensis&quot; by Corbet and Hill in 1992
The taxonomic status of these subspecies has not yet been evaluated.

=== Evolution ===
Palawan and Borneo specimens are genetically close, so the Asian palm civet on Palawan island might have dispersed from Borneo during the Pleistocene. It is possible that people later introduced Asian palm civet into other Philippines islands.

==In culture==
In Philippine mythology, the Bagobo people believe a being named Lakivot was said to be a huge and powerful palm civet who can talk. Lakivot defeated various monsters, including the one-eyed monster Ogassi and the &quot;busaw&quot; beings who guarded the Tree of Gold, which had the Flower of Gold that he sought. He was eventually transformed into a handsome young man, and married the person to whom he gave the Flower of Gold.
The Philippine twenty-peso note currently features the Asian palm civet on the reverse side.

<doc id="437751" wikidata="Q230087" url="?curid=437751" title="Tongue piercing">
<text>A tongue piercing is a body piercing usually done directly through the center of the tongue. Since its decline in popularity around 2011, it has seen a recent upsurge making it now the second most popular piercing amongst young women aged 18–25 in 2019. It has become quite unpopular amongst men, although in the 1990s and early 2000s, it was more popular for men than women to get and associated with punk culture. Midline tongue piercings, or one hole through the center of the tongue is the most common way to have the tongue pierced.

==History and culture==
The term &quot;tongue ring&quot; is often used to refer to tongue piercing, but this is not accurate as rings are rarely worn in tongue piercings.

There is a history of ritual tongue piercing in Aztec and Maya cultures. Priests would pierce their tongues and either draw blood from them or pass rough cords through to inflict pain. However, there is no evidence that the Aztecs practiced long-term or permanent tongue piercing, despite their use of other permanent body modifications, as it was done to honor their gods.

Tongue piercing has a long history in religious and performance practices. The Mesoamericans, such as the Aztecs, practiced this type of piercing as part of offerings to their deities. Similarly, Spirit Mediums in certain Australian tribes would practice tongue piercing as an offering and as a way to demonstrate their trance state.

From the turn of the 20th century, Western carnies borrowed many of their sideshow tricks from fakirs bringing to American and European audiences their first glimpses of tongue piercing.

Permanent or long term piercing of the tongue is part of the resurgence of body piercing in contemporary society. The ready availability of high quality, surgical steel barbell style jewelry is associated with the emergence of this piercing in the 1980s. As with many piercing innovations, the origin of this piercing is associated with Gauntlet, the first professional body piercing studio in the United States, formerly located in Los Angeles, California. 

Tattoo Samy appeared in &quot;PFIQ&quot; (the first publication about body piercing) in issues #18 (1983) and #19 as the magazine&#x27;s first documented tongue piercing.

Elayne Angel, the first person awarded the Master Piercer&#x27;s certificate by Jim Ward, body piercing pioneer, and founder of Gauntlet, helped popularize this type of piercing.

== Jewelry ==

Tongues are pierced with straight barbell style jewelry. Because of the frequent movement of the tongue, jewellery size and comfort is especially important. Barbells that are too thin are prone to migration, causing discomfort and irritation. Tongue piercings can often be easily stretched to accommodate larger jewellery. The initial piercing is often at 14 g (1.6 mm), but to avoid one or two stretching steps it is possible to pierce immediately at 12 g (2.0 mm) or even 10 g (2.4 mm). 

Some people later choose to stretch their piercing to 12 g (2 mm), 10 g (2.4 mm), 8 g (3.2 mm) or 6 g (4.0 mm) to protect against possible migration, and to have a more stable &#x27;snug&#x27; fit. It is possible to stretch further to diameters beyond 10 mm. The beads at the end of the barbell can be made of many decorative materials. &quot;No-see-um beads&quot;, flat beads matching the color of the tongue, are sometimes worn to conceal this piercing, often in places of employment. Using appropriate colored and styled jewellery, and taking care while talking/laughing, it is possible to conceal the piercing.

==Procedure==
===Piercing===
The piercer will check the underside of the tongue for large blood vessels, sometimes with a bright light, and mark a safe placement for the piercing. The tongue is then clamped with forceps, and pierced with a needle, usually from top to bottom with a piercing needle or from bottom to top with a cannula needle. Initial jewelry should always be considerably longer than will ultimately be required to allow for the swelling, which is common following the piercing. Within two days of getting the piercing the tongue can swell up to double its original size. This can lead to pain when speaking and eating, but this is not permanent.

Piercers often recommend drinking cold beverages, and sucking on crushed ice to help reduce the swelling. Some people find that taking Ibuprofen or similar anti-inflammatory drugs can greatly reduce the swelling associated with a tongue piercing. It is advisable not to drink alcohol, smoke or eat spicy food until the piercing is at least partially healed (around two weeks), and alcohol-free mouthwash should be used after eating or smoking.

After the swelling calms down, a period of mild tongue and oral mucosa irritation can follow, sometimes discouraging the recently pierced person from keeping the piercing. Appropriate mouth washing, care during meals, and some patience will usually be sufficient to come to a sufficiently healed state. After full healing the person is advised to replace the initial long barbell (to accommodate the initial swelling) with a shorter barbell. This second barbell is sometimes included in the price of the initial piercing procedure. It can be difficult for an inexperienced recently pierced person to replace the barbell with a shorter version, so often the help of the piercer is asked for. 

The second barbell is usually 2 mm – 4 mm shorter than the initial barbell, but should be adapted to the individual anatomy. After this replacement a second (short) healing period is observed. In case of absence of irritation, the further stretching procedure can be started.

Because of the tongue&#x27;s exceptional healing ability, piercings can close very fast. Even completely healed holes can close up in a matter of hours, and larger-stretched holes can close in just a few days. The length of time for the hole to heal varies greatly from person to person – some people with larger-stretched holes (greater than 4 g (5 mm)) can still fit jewelry (albeit smaller) in their piercing after months or even years.

It is generally recommended to avoid piercing in bodies under development or in people not capable of taking care of a recent piercing.

===Placement of the tongue piercing===

The traditional placement for a tongue piercing is along the midline of the tongue, in the center of the mouth. It is often approximately or so back from the tip of the tongue. It is placed with the top a little further back than the bottom, which allows the top of the jewelry to lean slightly back, away from the teeth, and toward the higher part of the upper palate where there is more room in the mouth. It is also usually positioned just in front of the attachment of the lingual frenulum.

A tongue frenulum piercing is a piercing through the frenulum underneath the tongue, known as the frenulum linguae, and commonly the tongue web piercing. &quot;Venom bites&quot; is the term given to two tongue piercings placed side by side on the tongue, which are considered to be more painful than a regular tongue piercing through the tongue&#x27;s center. Although the term &quot;angel bite&quot; is sometimes referred to as two piercings in the tongue with one placed right in front of another, the term is much more common for two Monroe piercings on either side of the face. There is also the &quot;snake-eyes&quot; which is one curved bar going horizontally through the tip of the tongue, it is mostly painless other than a mild amount of pressure.
It is possible to use a (stretched) tongue piercing as a first step to tongue splitting.

===Risks===
Documented complications of tongue piercings have included blood-borne infections causing brain and heart abscesses (with some deaths); hepatitis B and C, HIV, tuberculosis, and tetanus infections; swelling of the tongue causing airway obstruction, swallowing or choking on loose jewelry, damage to gums and broken teeth. Common complaints include pain, scars, excessive salivation and damage to tooth enamel.

Tongue piercings may cause speech impediments, such as a double tongue piercing restricting independent tongue mobility. There is also a risk of sensation loss.

===Adverse effects===
* Oral trauma, i.e. dental fracture and wear, affects 11% to 41% of subjects with tongue ornaments.
* Recession of gingival tissue affects 19% to 68% of subjects with tongue ornaments. The alveolar tooth-bearing bone may also be involved, jeopardizing the stability and durability of the teeth in place and requiring a periodontal regeneration surgery.
* Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.

<text>Nailsea is a town in North Somerset, England, southwest of Bristol, and northeast of Weston-super-Mare. The nearest village is Backwell, which lies south of Nailsea on the opposite side of the Bristol to Exeter railway line. Nailsea had a population of 15,917 in the 2021 Census.

The town was an industrial centre based on coal mining and glass manufacture, which have now been replaced by service industries. The surrounding North Somerset Levels has wildlife habitats including the Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake local nature reserve. Nailsea is close to the M5 motorway and Bristol Airport, and its railway station, Nailsea &amp; Backwell, has services operated by the Great Western Railway.

Secondary education is provided by Nailsea School (rebuilt in 2009), and primary education by St Francis School, Grove Junior School, Kingshill School and Golden Valley. Churches include the 14th-century Holy Trinity Church and Christ Church, which was built in 1843.

==History==
The name of the town may be derived from the Old English for &quot;Naegl&#x27;s island&quot;, although it has also been suggested it was spelt &quot;Naylsey&quot; in 1657.

The parish of Nailsea was part of the Portbury Hundred. Little is known of the area occupied by Nailsea before the coal mining industry began, although it was used as a quarry in Roman times from which pennant sandstone was extracted. The Romans otherwise ignored Nailsea from 40 to 400 AD, but left a small villa near Jacklands Bridge.

Nailsea&#x27;s early economy relied on coal mining, which began as early as the 16th century. The earliest recorded date for coal mining in Nailsea was 1507 when coal was being transported to light fires at Yatton. By the late 1700s the town had a large number of pits. Around this time Nailsea was visited by the social reformer Hannah More who founded a Sunday school for the workers. The Elms Colliery,(Middle Engine Pit), one of the most complete examples of an 18th-century colliery left in England, is now in disrepair. It has been designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage. Remains of the old pits, most of which had closed down by the late 19th century as mining capital migrated to the richer seams of South Wales, are still visible around the town.

The coal mines attracted glass manufacturer John Robert Lucas, who in 1788 established the Nailsea Glassworks that became the fourth-largest of its kind in the United Kingdom, mostly producing low-grade bottle glass. The works closed down in 1873, but &quot;Nailsea&quot; glass (mostly made by glass workers at the end of their shift in Nailsea and at other glass works) is still sought after by collectors around the world. The site of the glass works has been covered by a Tesco supermarket car park, leaving it relatively accessible for future archaeological digs. Other parts of the site have been cleared and filled with sand to ensure that the remains of the old glass works are preserved.

Nowhere was a historical hamlet that existed on the west side of the town until 1967, when it was demolished for development. Nowhere Wood, a small residential woodland, is named after it.

The 15th-century Nailsea Court, southwest of the town, is a Grade I listed building.

==Governance==
Nailsea was part of Long Ashton Rural District from 1894 to 1974. It is now within the North Somerset unitary authority, which covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare.

Four electoral wards exist in &quot;Nailsea&quot;:

*Nailsea Golden Valley
*Nailsea West End
*Nailsea Yeo
*Nailsea Youngwood

It is in the North Somerset constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Since the 2024 general election the constituency has been represented by Sadik Al-Hassan of the Labour Party.

==Geography==

The Land Yeo river flows to the east of the town. The North Somerset Levels to the west have been drained and farmed by generations of farmers. Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors SSSI is a 129.4 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. The soils in the area include clays of the Allerton and Wentloog Series and peat soils of the Sedgemoor and Godney Series, which are drained by a network of large rhynes and smaller field ditches, which support exceptionally rich plant and invertebrate fauna communities. Exceptional populations of Coleoptera occur, amongst which are at least 12 nationally scarce species and 2 nationally rare species, including Britain&#x27;s largest water beetle the great silver water beetle (&quot;Hydrophilus piceus&quot;). There are several other local nature reserves.

The Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake local nature reserve, southeast of the town centre and close to the Nailsea and Backwell railway station, was constructed as a balancing pond in the mid-1970s, and has since become home to various wildfowl and dragonflies and a foraging area for bats. Bird species seen on the reserve include gadwall, northern shoveler, pochard, tufted duck, grey heron and mute swans.

Nearby towns and villages include Backwell, Wraxall, Portishead, Clevedon, and Tickenham. Nailsea is from the centre of Bristol, and close to the tourist centres of Weston-super-Mare and Bath. It is by road from the port and service area at Avonmouth.

===Climate===

In common with the rest of South West England, Nailsea has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately .

The summer months of July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, although convective cloud sometimes forms inland and reduces the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by the Sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

<text>Bearsden () is a town in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland, on the northwestern fringe of Greater Glasgow, approximately from the city centre. 

The Roman Antonine Wall runs through the town, and the remains of a military bath house can be seen near the town centre. The current settlement began in the 17th century as the kirkton of the parish of New Kilpatrick, and when a railway connection to Glasgow was constructed in 1863, it developed into an affluent suburb of the city. 

By 2020, it had an estimated population of 28,470.

==History==
===Roman===
The first known settlement on the site of present-day Bearsden was a Roman fort in the second century AD. Between 142 and 144 AD, under Emperor Antoninus Pius, the Romans built a stone and turf fortification, called the Antonine Wall, between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. They also built the Military Way, a road that ran parallel, to the south of the wall. The fort was positioned at the intersection of the Military Way, and the north–south road between Glasgow and Loch Lomond. A video reconstruction of the site has been produced. In 164 AD, after only 20 years, the Romans withdrew to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

Little of the fort remains today. However, close to the fort was a Roman bath-house, built in approximately 142–143 AD. The bath-house&#x27;s remains were discovered by builders digging foundations for a housing development in 1973. The site was donated to the government, and today the remains lie, well-preserved, from the town centre. Two further stretches of the Antonine Wall&#x27;s stone base can be seen in the New Kilpatrick Cemetery on Boclair Road.

===Pre-industrial===
Prior to 1649, the area formed part of a larger parish called Kilpatrick. One part was called West, or Old Kilpatrick, and covered Dumbarton and areas of west Dunbartonshire, such as Clydebank. The remaining part was named East or New Kilpatrick, covering a much greater area than Bearsden, from the River Clyde at Whiteinch and Yoker to Duntocher, Strathblane and Baldernock. Modern Bearsden began in an agricultural area as a small hamlet called New Kirk (or perhaps Chapelton) close to New Kilpatrick Parish Church, which was first built in 1649. Close landmarks included Canniesburn Toll, and a water mill at Garscube. The present-day church was built in 1807.

The size and style of the community prior to urbanisation is recorded in &quot;Rambles Round Glasgow&quot;, first published in 1854. The author describes a route from Maryhill, crossing the River Kelvin at Garscube Mill to Canniesburn. At that point, the route takes the road to Drymen, rather than the alternative to Milngavie. Of particular note are the woods and gardens surrounding the fine houses of Killermont and Garscube, which are contrasted with a small shop at Canniesburn with apparently nothing left for sale. The kirk-toun (modern Bearsden Cross) is described as consisting of about a dozen cottages of idyllic rural beauty, isolated from the noise and dirt of Glasgow. The account also includes one of the earliest references to &quot;Bear&#x27;s Den&quot;, and although the location is not clear, a traditional belief is recorded that it was a Roman burial site.

===Modern===
The New Kirk settlement grew from the middle of the nineteenth century when Glaswegian businessmen built houses at a commutable distance from the city. In 1863, the Glasgow and Milngavie Junction Railway opened, with a station near New Kirk called Bearsden. This was soon adopted as the name of the community. The opening of the railway led to considerable development of Bearsden, with many large Victorian houses built in what is now known as Old Bearsden Conservation Area.

The Glasgow Reformatory for Girls at East Chapelton (also known as East Chapelton Home and Hillfoot Residential School) moved from Rottenrow to Bearsden in the late 1860s. Managed by Glasgow Corporation, the countryside location moved the girls away from any malign influences to be found in the city and allowed the institution to be self-supporting with livestock and a vegetable garden. The girls washed their own clothes and those of local residents in the Reformatory&#x27;s large laundry. In addition to girls who had fallen foul of the courts, others with problems such as malnourishment and learning difficulties were also housed at Chapelton. In 1949, around 360 girls passed through the school annually and were taken to New Kilpatrick Parish church on Sundays. The school closed in the early 1970s and after a brief period as a hall of residence for the Nautical College, the building was demolished to make way for a shopping centre with a Fine Fare supermarket (later replaced by Asda).
Buchanan Retreat was built in 1890 by the Buchanan sisters of Bellfield, near Kilmarnock, in Ayrshire. It was taken over by Bearsden Burgh in 1962 and, known as Boclair House, used as council offices &quot;(pictured below under Administration)&quot;. Latterly used by East Dunbartonshire council, it was placed on the market in 2012 following council cost-cutting measures and staff redistribution. In 2016 the building opened as Boclair House Hotel, a hotel, wedding venue, and restaurant, which has since won several awards. The Schaw Home (pictured) was built in 1895 by Miss Marjory Shanks Schaw in memory of her brother and gifted to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The building has now been split into private residential apartments.

In 1906, many buildings were built at Bearsden Cross by Mathew Henderson (he also tried, unsuccessfully, to develop another commuter suburb at Drumchapel). Westerton Garden suburb was built around 1913 and is also now a conservation area near Westerton station. Near this is the site of the former Canniesburn Hospital, which has many Art Deco buildings and where pioneering plastic surgery was performed, notably on the Boy David who was featured on many television programmes and was adopted by one of the doctors there. The hospital site has now been developed into flats, but much of the character has been retained and copied. A further station in Bearsden is at Hillfoot. Bearsden continued to expand in the twentieth century as residents built large independently designed villas, estates of bungalows, and other types of houses. Few sites are now left unoccupied.

In 1958, Bearsden became a Burgh. Then, in 1975, it became part of Bearsden &amp; Milngavie District Council. Since 1996, it has been the largest of the five major towns of East Dunbartonshire Council.

===Toponymy===
Bearsden was first known as Kirktoun(e) or New/Easter Kilpatrick village, all of which relate to the parish church situated in the centre of the town. There is no evidence that the village itself (rather than the parish) was ever called &quot;New Kilpatrick&quot; by locals (by the mid 19th century the houses near to the church had come to be called New Kirk). Nevertheless, the name appears over the village on old maps (see image below) and the town&#x27;s official Gaelic name is &quot;Cille Phàdraig Ùr&quot;. The Scots language records of the Parliament of Scotland prior to the Acts of Union 1707 use the names &quot;Easter Kirkpatrick&quot; and &quot;Eister Kilpatrick&quot; for the parish.

The current name Bearsden originated from the railway station built in 1863, but the origin of the name itself is unresolved. The station was named after a house near the station site (to avoid confusion with Old Kilpatrick station), but it was recorded as a name for the immediate area before that time. 
The meaning behind the name &quot;Bearsden&quot; may be one of the following:
* A nickname given to the area of the Manse Burn by a Garscube heir
* It relates to the barley (bear) that grew in the glen (dene)
* It could be related to Gaelic, meaning &quot;entrenchments of the fort&quot;
* The most common explanation is that the sons of a local laird once kept a pet bear in a den there, but there is no evidence to support this.
To quote James McCardel, &quot;the wisest course is frankly to admit that the derivation [of the name of Bearsden] is unknown&quot;.

===Coat of arms===

The Lord Lyon King of Arms granted a coat of arms to the Burgh of Bearsden on 29 June 1959. Since 1975, details have been incorporated into the arms of subsequent local administrative bodies (Bearsden and Milngavie, then East Dunbartonshire). The arms feature the following details:
*The mural coronet shows that these arms belong to a municipal police burgh in Scotland.
*The field (or shield background) is gold, a colour taken from the arms of the Clan Campbell of Succoth (Garscube Estate). The engrailed black diagonal stripe and the buckle are modified from the arms of the Campbell-Colquhouns (of Garscadden and Killermont); representing the three estates upon which much of Bearsden is now built.
*The rose is taken from the arms of Lennox, representing Dunbartonshire.
*The lower portion is an example of canting arms – it represents the name of the town as a rebus, with a bear apparently looking into a den, while muzzled in traditional heraldic style.
*The Scots motto on the Bearsden coat of arms is &quot;Bear the Gree&quot; (a phrase occurring frequently in Scots literature from about 1420, including in Robert Burns&#x27; A Man&#x27;s A Man for A&#x27; That) which means &#x27;to hold or win first place&#x27;.

==Education==
There are two secondary schools in the town, Bearsden Academy and Boclair Academy which both have academic performance &quot;well above average&quot;. These are fed by seven primary schools within the town (Boclair Academy&#x27;s fourth feeder primary is located outside Bearsden in Torrance) and a small number of placing requests from other areas. An eighth primary school, St Nicolas’, feeds three Catholic secondary schools outside Bearsden. The High School of Glasgow has a primary school section in the town – this is the result of a merger between the school and the former Drewsteignton Home School, founded in 1922.

==Demography==

Bearsden is primarily a middle-class commuter suburb. The majority of its housing stock is detached. According to the 2001 census of Scotland, the area comprises 10,417 households, with a total population of 27,967. This is an increase of 0.6% (or 161 people) since 1991, when the population stood at 27,806 (there are an average of 2.64 people per household). Of these, 8,306 are over 55 years old, 17,700 are in social class ABC1, and 6,052 are in social class C2DE. A similar population figure was estimated in 2010 for the two council wards (27,551). 73% of working residents surveyed travel to work by car, 16% by train or bus, 5% by other methods, and 6% work mainly at home. Many of the west of Scotland&#x27;s most expensive houses are in the Old Bearsden Outstanding Conservation Area – Bearsden&#x27;s postcode (G61) was ranked 7th richest in the UK by a 2005 survey, with an estimated 176 millionaires living there. By comparison, just 235 people were estimated to be receiving Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance in 2011.

The graphic is a summary of maps of the area since 1832. These demonstrate the growth of the town to its current extent from a large number of disconnected dwellings to a large settlement spreading from the New Kirk area. The relative size of houses (and corresponding affluence of households) tends to increase with age, but this is not a strict rule.

==Administration==

Bearsden forms two East Dunbartonshire Council wards (there are eight in total), called Bearsden North and Bearsden South. Each Ward has three councillors elected through a single transferable vote system.

Ward 2 – Bearsden North

For representatives, see &quot;Results from 5 May 2022 election for Bearsden North&quot;

Bearsden North is part of the Clydebank and Milngavie constituency in the Scottish Parliament. The MSP is Marie McNair (SNP); elected on 5 May 2021.

For representatives, see &quot;Results from 5 May 2022 election for Bearsden South&quot;

Bearsden South is part of the Strathkelvin and Bearsden constituency in the Scottish Parliament. The MSP is Rona Mackay (SNP); elected May 2016.

Both constituencies form part of the West of Scotland regional list in the Scottish Parliament. The town is also part of the East Dunbartonshire constituency in the UK Parliament at Westminster. The current MP is Amy Callaghan (SNP) who defeated incumbent Jo Swinson (Liberal Democrats) at the 2019 general election.

==Transport links==

Bearsden can be accessed by rail from Bearsden, Westerton or Hillfoot stations.

It can also be accessed by road, of which the main routes are:
==Neighbourhoods==

Neighbourhoods in Bearsden, like those in many other towns, do not have clear boundaries; where places like Kessington were once a few houses together surrounded by agricultural land, they now merge with other (once distinct) areas, like Killermont. In general terms, however, the neighbourhoods of Bearsden can be described as follows:

*The town centre (also known as Bearsden Cross) is located at the intersection of the A809 (Drymen Road) and A808 (Roman Road). It was formerly known as New Kirk, as can be seen on postcards from the early 20th century. There are a number of shops in the area, representing most retail sectors, including a small supermarket. There are four functioning church buildings (Bearsden Cross Parish Church, All Saints Episcopal Church, New Kilpatrick Parish Church and St. Andrew&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church) a primary school, Bearsden Burgh Hall and Brookwood Public Library. Bearsden Ski Club and the Roman bath-house (across from which is Bearsden Baptist church and the Scout Hall of the 24th Glasgow Scout Group) lie on the edge the town centre. The former Bearsden North Church is a listed building, but is currently unused and is awaiting redevelopment proposals.
*Old Bearsden describes the area in Central / West Bearsden which are some of the most desirable residential areas of the country with sizeable sandstone villas. In 1855, John Campbell Colquhoun (a director of the Glasgow &amp; Milngavie Junction Railway Company) drew up plans for housebuilding near Bearsden Station. Ledcameroch Road and Crescent were part of this plan, but the remainder was never completed as intended. Three of the largest houses, (Ledcameroch, St Germains and Lochbrae) were demolished and redeveloped between 1977 &amp; 1985. The term now generally includes Bearsden Cross. 
*Westerton is to the Southwest of the town, particularly the conservation area of 1920s buildings, shops, library and church around Maxwell Avenue, having clear boundaries with Drumchapel, Knightswood and Netherton in Glasgow. It has its own train station, Westerton railway station and primary school (Westerton Primary School).
*Castlehill/Courthill and Baljaffray lie to the Northwest of the town, and principally compose of post-1970 developments. The name Castlehill relates back to the presence of a Roman fort along the line of the Antonine Wall, although this is no longer visible. Modern Baljaffray was built in two phases; the residential areas, school and shopping precinct of South Baljaffray in the early 1970s were followed in the 1980s by further housing North Baljaffray – the two areas are divided by Baljaffray Road. Baljaffray has had a primary school since 1974, the logo of which represents a mine wheel, reflecting the coal-mining history of the area until the closure of the workings in 1910.
*Mosshead lies to the North of the town, having a boundary with Milngavie.
*Hillfoot lies to the East of the town centre, and was once a large house, demolished and built on in the first half of the 20th century.
*Kessington and Killermont cover the remainder of the East of Bearsden, a rough dividing line between the two being from Kessington Hall to Boclair Academy.
*Chapelton is shown on some of the oldest maps of the area. Originally just a few houses on Drymen Road south of Bearsden Cross, the area now covers the area between Milngavie Road, Drymen Road and Roman Road.
*To the South and West of Chapelton is Canniesburn, formerly the site of a tollhouse and smithy, now a huge roundabout. Canniesburn Hospital was partly demolished after its closure in 2001 and premium residences now stand on the site.

==Leisure Activities==

===Football===
The Bearsden Amateur Football Club was constituted in 1890 and its founders were drawn mainly from the employees of the staging post, originally situated at Bearsden Cross. Their first ground was in Drymen road, now the site of the public hall and All Saints church and when the ground was re-developed the club moved on to Station Road where they played until the club disbanded on the outbreak of war in 1914. In 1919 the club reformed and played for the first time on their present ground at Thorn Park. The club won the Scottish Amateur Cup in 1961–62, beating Pencaitland 1–0 at Hampden Park.

Presently they participate in the Caledonian Amateur Football League and other cup competitions.

Westerton United (1997) is another local grassroots football team.

===Golf===

The Glasgow Golf Club is one of the world&#x27;s oldest, founded in 1787. In 1904 the club moved premises to Killermont House and its surrounding estate, built in 1805 for the Campbell-Colquhoun family. The club is unusual in having a links course (at Gailes, near Irvine) in addition to its home course.

Bearsden Golf Club, to the East of Bearsden Cross, has a nine-hole course, with seven alternative greens, thus enabling a full round to be played. Its layout has not changed significantly from its foundation in 1891.

Douglas Park Golf Club, Hillfoot, has a full course and can trace its history back to 1897, although the current layout dates from 1972.

Windyhill Golf Club (founded 1908), West of Baljaffray, has an 18-hole course laid out by James Braid, who subsequently modified Glasgow Golf Club&#x27;s Killermont course 16 years later. The course has views of the River Clyde, Campsie Fells and Kilpatrick Hills.

===Highland Games===
Highland Games for Bearsden and Milngavie are held annually at the West of Scotland Rugby Ground.

===Skiing===
Bearsden Ski Club was formed circa 1964 by a small band of enthusiasts. The club has a membership of about 1200 skiers, boarders and social members. The club facilities include the Main alpine slope, two nursery slopes, a freestyle slope and a club house, it also currently undergoing further renovation. It provides a wide range of activities from skiing cross-country on one of their trips to tubing on the freestyle slope.

===Chess===
Bearsden have a competitive chess club, with one team from the club winning the Glasgow Division 1 League outright in 2010.

===Scouting and Girlguiding===

The 24th Glasgow (Bearsden) Scout Group, was formed in January 1908 and is one of the largest Groups in the UK with four Beaver Colonies, four Cub Packs, three Scout Troops and an Explorer Unit, as well as providing a meeting place for Scout Network. There is a published history of the group. The group is known for its many international camps, including a biennial visit to the Kandersteg International Scout Centre since 1949 and currently has over 600 members.
The 183rd Glasgow Scout Group, was formed in 1947 by the Home Guard and has two Beaver Colonies, two Cub Packs, one Scout Troop and an Explorer Unit. It currently has over 130 members. Like the 24th, it goes on many international camps during the summer holidays to Germany, Canada, Belgium, and more recently, Croatia.
Both Groups are part of the Clyde Region of the Scout Association.
Girlguiding is also active in Bearsden, with units based at Killermont Parish Church and at the Guide Hut in Pendicle Road. The local units are members of the Girlguiding Dunbartonshire.

In statistics, the matrix normal distribution or matrix Gaussian distribution is a probability distribution that is a generalization of the multivariate normal distribution to matrix-valued random variables.

== Definition ==
The probability density function for the random matrix X (&quot;n&quot; × &quot;p&quot;) that follows the matrix normal distribution formula_4 has the form:

:formula_5

where formula_6 denotes trace and M is &quot;n&quot; × &quot;p&quot;, U is &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; and V is &quot;p&quot; × &quot;p&quot;, and the density is understood as the probability density function with respect to the standard Lebesgue measure in formula_7, i.e.: the measure corresponding to integration with respect to formula_8.

The matrix normal is related to the multivariate normal distribution in the following way:

:formula_9

if and only if

:formula_10

where formula_11 denotes the Kronecker product and formula_12 denotes the vectorization of formula_1.

===Proof===
The equivalence between the above &quot;matrix normal&quot; and &quot;multivariate normal&quot; density functions can be shown using several properties of the trace and Kronecker product, as follows. We start with the argument of the exponent of the matrix normal PDF: 
:formula_14
which is the argument of the exponent of the multivariate normal PDF with respect to Lebesgue measure in formula_15. The proof is completed by using the determinant property: formula_16

==Properties==
If formula_17, then we have the following properties:

===Expected values===
The mean, or expected value is:
:formula_18
and we have the following second-order expectations:
:formula_19

:formula_20
where formula_21 denotes trace.

More generally, for appropriately dimensioned matrices A,B,C:
:formula_22

===Transformation===
Transpose transform:

:formula_23

Linear transform: let D (&quot;r&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot;), be of full rank &quot;r ≤ n&quot; and C (&quot;p&quot;-by-&quot;s&quot;), be of full rank &quot;s ≤ p&quot;, then:

:formula_24

===Composition===
The product of two matrix normal distributions
:formula_25
is proportional to a normal distribution with parameters:
:formula_26
:formula_27

==Example==
Let&#x27;s imagine a sample of &quot;n&quot; independent &quot;p&quot;-dimensional random variables identically distributed according to a multivariate normal distribution:
:formula_28.
When defining the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;p&quot; matrix formula_29 for which the &quot;i&quot;th row is formula_30, we obtain:
:formula_31
where each row of formula_1 is equal to formula_33, that is formula_34, formula_2 is the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; identity matrix, that is the rows are independent, and formula_36.

==Maximum likelihood parameter estimation==
Given &quot;k&quot; matrices, each of size &quot;n&quot; × &quot;p&quot;, denoted formula_37, which we assume have been sampled i.i.d. from a matrix normal distribution, the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters can be obtained by maximizing:
:formula_38
The solution for the mean has a closed form, namely
:formula_39
but the covariance parameters do not. However, these parameters can be iteratively maximized by zero-ing their gradients at: 
:formula_40

==Drawing values from the distribution==
Sampling from the matrix normal distribution is a special case of the sampling procedure for the multivariate normal distribution. Let formula_29 be an &quot;n&quot; by &quot;p&quot; matrix of &quot;np&quot; independent samples from the standard normal distribution, so that

==Relation to other distributions==
Dawid (1981) provides a discussion of the relation of the matrix-valued normal distribution to other distributions, including the Wishart distribution, inverse-Wishart distribution and matrix t-distribution, but uses different notation from that employed here.

<doc id="437761" wikidata="Q1345775" url="?curid=437761" title="Whitey Ford">
<text>Edward Charles &quot;Whitey&quot; Ford (October 21, 1928 – October 8, 2020), nicknamed &quot;the Chairman of the Board&quot;, was an American professional baseball pitcher who played his entire 16-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the New York Yankees. He was a 10-time All-Star and six-time World Series champion. In 1961, he won both the Cy Young Award and World Series Most Valuable Player Award. Ford led the American League (AL) in wins three times and in earned run average twice. He is the Yankees franchise leader in career wins (236), shutouts (45), innings pitched (), and games started by a pitcher (438; tied with Andy Pettitte). Ford was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974.

Ford signed with the Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1947 and made his major league debut in 1950. Following a two-year sojourn to serve in the United States Army during the Korean War, Ford returned to the Yankees in 1953 and pitched for them until retiring in 1967. During his tenure with the team, Ford set numerous World Series pitching records, including consecutive scoreless innings (33), wins (10), games started (22), innings pitched (146), and strikeouts (94). The Yankees retired his uniform number 16 in 1974 and dedicated a plaque in his honor in Monument Park in 1987. Ford served as the Yankees pitching coach in 1964 while still a player and from 1974 to 1975 after retiring. He also served as the team&#x27;s first base coach in 1968.

In the wake of Yogi Berra&#x27;s death in 2015, George Vecsey of &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that Ford was now &quot;The Greatest Living Yankee&quot;. Ford died on October 8, 2020, at the age of 91.

==Early life==
Ford was born in Manhattan. At age five, he moved to the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, a few miles from the Triborough Bridge to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. He attended public schools and graduated from the Manhattan High School of Aviation Trades.

In 1951, Ford married Joan at St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church in Astoria. 
They lived in Glen Cove, New York on Long Island for a period during the 1950s, and had two sons and a daughter together.

==Professional career==
===Early years===
Ford was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1947 and played his entire career with them. While still in the minor leagues, he was nicknamed &quot;Whitey&quot; for his light blond hair.

Ford began his Major League Baseball career on July 1, 1950, with the Yankees. He won his first nine decisions before losing a game in relief. Ford received a handful of lower-ballot Most Valuable Player (MVP) votes despite throwing just 112 innings, and won the &quot;Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year Award.
During the Korean War era, in 1951 and 1952, Ford served in the United States Army. He rejoined the Yankees for the 1953 season, and the Yankee &quot;Big Three&quot; pitching staff became a &quot;Big Four&quot;, as Ford joined Allie Reynolds, Vic Raschi, and Eddie Lopat. Ford wore number 19 in his rookie season, but upon his return he changed to number 16, which he wore for the remainder of his career.

Ford eventually went from the number-four pitcher on a great staff to the universally acclaimed number-one pitcher of the Yankees. He became known as the &quot;Chairman of the Board&quot; for his ability to remain calm and in command during high-pressure situations. He was also known as &quot;Slick&quot;, a nickname given to him, Billy Martin, and Mickey Mantle by manager Casey Stengel, who called them Whiskey Slicks. Ford&#x27;s guile was necessary because he did not have an overwhelming fastball, but being able to throw several other pitches very well gave him pinpoint control. Ford was an effective strikeout pitcher for his time, tying the then-AL record of six consecutive strikeouts in 1956, and again in 1958. Ford never threw a no-hitter, but he pitched two consecutive one-hit games in 1955 to tie a record held by several pitchers. Sal Maglie, star pitcher for the New York Giants, thought Ford had a similar style to his own, writing in 1958 that Ford had a &quot;good curve, good control, [a] changeup, [and an] occasional sneaky fastball.&quot;
In 1955, Ford led the American League in complete games and games won; in 1956 in earned run average and winning percentage; in 1958, in earned run average; and in both 1961 and 1963, in games won and winning percentage. Ford won the Cy Young Award in 1961; he likely would have won the 1963 AL Cy Young, but this was before the institution of a separate award for each league, and Ford could not match Sandy Koufax&#x27;s numbers for the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League (NL).

Some of Ford&#x27;s totals were depressed by Yankees&#x27; manager Casey Stengel, who viewed Ford as his top pitching asset and often reserved his ace left-hander for more formidable opponents such as the Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox. When Ralph Houk became the manager in 1961, he promised Ford that he would pitch every fourth day, regardless of the opponent; after exceeding 30 starts only once in his nine seasons under Stengel, Ford had 39 in 1961. Indeed 1961 was his first 20-win season, a career-best 25–4 record, and the Cy Young Award ensued, but Ford&#x27;s season was overshadowed by the home run battle between Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. As a left-hander with an excellent pick-off move, Ford was also deft at keeping runners at their base: He set a record in 1961 by pitching 243 consecutive innings without allowing a stolen base.

In May 1963, after pitching a shutout, Ford announced he had given up smoking. He said, &quot;My doctor told me that whenever I think of smoking, I should think of a bus starting up and blowing the exhaust in my face.&quot;

===Final years and retirement===
Ford ended his career in declining health. In August 1966, he underwent surgery to correct a circulatory problem in his throwing shoulder. In May 1967, Ford lasted just one inning in what would be his final start, and he announced his retirement at the end of the month at age 38.

After retiring, Ford admitted in interviews to having occasionally doctored baseballs. Examples were the &quot;mudball&quot;, used at home in Yankee Stadium. Yankee groundskeepers would wet down an area near the catcher&#x27;s box where the Yankee catcher Elston Howard was positioned; pretending to lose balance, Howard would put down his hand with the ball and coat one side of the ball with mud and throw it to Ford. Ford also engaged in ball scuffing, sometimes used the diamond in his wedding ring to gouge the ball, but he was eventually caught by an umpire and warned to stop. Howard sharpened a buckle on his shinguard and used it to scuff the ball.

Ford described his illicit behavior as a concession to age:

I didn&#x27;t begin cheating until late in my career when I needed something to help me survive. I didn&#x27;t cheat when I won the twenty-five games in . I don&#x27;t want anybody to get any ideas and take my Cy Young Award away. And I didn&#x27;t cheat in when I won twenty-four games. Well, maybe a little.

Ford admitted to doctoring the ball in the 1961 All-Star Game at Candlestick Park to strike out Willie Mays. Ford and Mantle had accumulated $1,200 ($ today) in golf pro shop purchases as guests of Horace Stoneham at the Giants owner&#x27;s country club. Stoneham promised to pay their tab if Ford could strike out Mays. &quot;What was that all about?&quot; Mays asked. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Willie, but I had to throw you a spitter,&quot; Ford replied.

==Career statistics==

Ford won 236 games for the New York Yankees (career 236–106), still a franchise record. Ford is tied with Dave Foutz for the fourth-best winning percentage in baseball history at .690.

Ford&#x27;s 2.75 earned run average is the third-lowest among starting pitchers whose careers began after the advent of the live-ball era in 1920. Through 2023, only Clayton Kershaw (2.48) and Jacob deGrom (2.53) have a lower earned run average. Ford&#x27;s worst earned run average in a single season was 3.24. Ford had 45 shutout victories in his career, including eight 1–0 wins.

As a hitter, Ford posted a .173 batting average (177-for-1,023) with 91 runs, 3 home runs, 69 runs batted in, and 113 bases on balls. In 22 World Series games, he batted .082 (4-for-49) with 4 runs, 3 runs batted in, and 7 walks. Defensively, he recorded a .961 fielding percentage.

===World Series and All-Star Games===
During his MLB career, Ford had 10 World Series victories, more than any other pitcher. Ford also leads all starters in World Series losses (8) and starts (22), as well as innings, hits, walks, and strikeouts. In 1961, he broke Babe Ruth&#x27;s World Series record of consecutive scoreless innings. The record eventually reached , although MLB rule-makers retroactively reduced the record to 33 innings since Ford did not complete a full inning before allowing the streak-ending run. It is still a World Series record, although Mariano Rivera broke it as a postseason record in 2000. Ford won the 1961 World Series MVP Award. He appeared on eight AL All-Star teams between 1954 and 1964.

==Honors and legacy==

In 1974, Ford and Mickey Mantle were both elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame; at that time, the Yankees retired his number 16.

In 1984, Ford was elected to the Long Island Sports Hall of Fame.

In 1987, the Yankees dedicated plaques for Monument Park at Yankee Stadium for Ford and Lefty Gomez.

In 1999, Ford ranked 52nd on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; List of Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Players. He was nominated that year for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

In 1994, a road in Mississauga, Ontario, was named Ford Road in his honor. The north-central area of Mississauga is known informally as &quot;the baseball zone&quot;, as several streets in the area are named for Hall of Fame baseball players.

In 2000, the ballfield overlooking the East River on 26th Avenue, between 1st and 2nd Streets in Astoria, Queens, was named Whitey Ford Field at a Yankee Stadium ceremony.

==Post-playing career==

Ford was the Yankees pitching coach during the 1964 season. In 1968, he served as the Yankees as first base coach, and in 1974 and 1975 as pitching coach.

In 1977, Ford was part of the broadcast team for the first game in Toronto Blue Jays history. In 2008, Ford threw the first pitch at the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Also in 1977, Ford began serving as the commissioner of the new American Professional Slow-Pitch Softball League (APSPL), one of several men&#x27;s professional softball leagues in the United States.

In 2002, Ford opened &quot;Whitey Ford&#x27;s Cafe&quot;, a sports-themed restaurant and bar next to Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, New York. A replica of the Yankee Stadium facade trimmed both the exterior and the bar, whose stools displayed uniform numbers of Yankee luminaries and widescreen TVs were installed throughout. The main dining area housed a panoramic display of Yankee Stadium from the 1950s, specifically a Chicago White Sox–Yankee game with Ford pitching and Mickey Mantle in center field; the Yanks were up 2–0. The servers were dressed in Yankees road uniforms, with Ford&#x27;s No. 16 on the back. It lasted less than a year before it closed down.

As of 2015, the 86-year-old Ford was splitting his time between his homes in Long Island and Florida.

Ford died on October 8, 2020, at his home in Lake Success on Long Island at the age of 91, 13 days before his 92nd birthday. He was watching the Yankees play in Game 4 of the 2020 American League Division Series on television, and was surrounded by his family. The cause of death was not immediately announced, but he had suffered from dementia for several years. When he died he was the second-oldest living member of the Hall of Fame, after Tommy Lasorda. He was the last surviving member of the 1956 World Champion New York Yankees.

<text>Fagus sylvatica, the European beech or common beech, is a large, graceful deciduous tree in the beech family with smooth silvery-gray bark, large leaf area, and a short trunk with low branches.

== Description ==
&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; is a large tree, capable of reaching heights of up to tall and trunk diameter, though more typically tall and up to trunk diameter. A 10-year-old sapling will stand about tall. Undisturbed, the European beech has a lifespan of 300 years; one tree at the Valle Cervara site was more than 500 years old—the oldest known in the northern hemisphere. In cultivated forest stands trees are normally harvested at 80–120 years of age. 30 years are needed to attain full maturity (as compared to 40 for American beech). Like most trees, its form depends on the location: in forest areas, &quot;F. sylvatica&quot; grows to over , with branches being high up on the trunk. In open locations, it will become much shorter (typically ) and more massive.

The leaves are alternate, simple, and entire or with a slightly crenate margin, long and broad, with 6–7 veins on each side of the leaf (as opposed to 7–10 veins in &quot;F. orientalis&quot;). When crenate, there is one point at each vein tip, never any points between the veins. The buds are long and slender, long and thick, but thicker, up to , where the buds include flower buds.

The leaves of beech are often not abscissed (dropped) in the autumn and instead remain on the tree until the spring. This process is called marcescence. This particularly occurs when trees are saplings or when plants are clipped as a hedge (making beech hedges attractive screens, even in winter), but it also often continues to occur on the lower branches when the tree is mature.

Small quantities of seeds may be produced around 10 years of age, but not a heavy crop until the tree is at least 30 years old. &quot;F. sylvatica&quot; male flowers are borne in the small catkins which are a hallmark of the Fagales order (beeches, chestnuts, oaks, walnuts, hickories, birches, and hornbeams). The female flowers produce beechnuts, small triangular nuts long and wide at the base; there are two nuts in each cupule, maturing in the autumn 5–6 months after pollination. Flower and seed production is particularly abundant in years following a hot, sunny and dry summer, though rarely for two years in a row.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The European beech is the most abundant hardwood species in Austrian, German and Swiss forests. The native range extends from the north, in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Bulgaria, eastern parts of Russia, Romania, through Europe to France, southern England, Spain (on the Cantabrian, Iberian and Central mountain ranges), and east to northwest Turkey, where it exhibits an interspecific cline with the oriental beech (&quot;Fagus orientalis&quot;), which replaces it further east. In the Balkans, it shows some hybridisation with oriental beech; these hybrid trees are named &quot;Fagus × taurica&quot; Popl. [&quot;Fagus moesiaca&quot; (Domin, Maly) Czecz.]. In the southern part of its range around the Mediterranean, and Sicily, it grows only in mountain forests, at altitude.

Although often regarded as native in southern England, recent evidence suggests that &quot;F. sylvatica&quot; did not arrive in England until about 4000 BC, or 2,000 years subsequent to the English Channel forming following the ice ages; it could have been an early introduction by Stone Age humans, who used the nuts for food. The beech is classified as a native in the south of England and as a non-native in the north where it is often removed from &#x27;native&#x27; woods. Localised pollen records have been recorded in the North of England from the Iron Age by Sir Harry Godwin. Changing climatic conditions may put beech populations in southern England under increased stress and while it may not be possible to maintain the current levels of beech in some sites it is thought that conditions for beech in north-west England will remain favourable or even improve. It is often planted in Britain. Similarly, the nature of Norwegian beech populations is subject to debate. If native, they would represent the northern range of the species. However, molecular genetic analyses support the hypothesis that these populations represent intentional introduction from Denmark before and during the Viking Age. However, the beech in Vestfold and at Seim north of Bergen in Norway is now spreading naturally and regarded as native.

Though not demanding of its soil type, the European beech has several significant requirements: a humid atmosphere (precipitation well distributed throughout the year and frequent fogs) and well-drained soil (being intolerant of excessive stagnant water). It prefers moderately fertile ground, calcified or lightly acidic, therefore it is found more often on the side of a hill than at the bottom of clayey basin. It tolerates rigorous winter cold, but is sensitive to spring frost. In Norway&#x27;s oceanic climate planted trees grow well north to Bodø Municipality, and produce seedlings and can spread naturally in Trondheim. In Sweden, beech trees do not grow as far north as in Norway.

A beech forest is very dark and few species of plant are able to survive there, where the sun barely reaches the ground. Young beeches prefer some shade and may grow poorly in full sunlight. In a clear-cut forest a European beech will germinate and then die of excessive dryness. Under oaks with sparse leaf cover it will quickly surpass them in height and, due to the beech&#x27;s dense foliage, the oaks will die from lack of sunlight.

== Ecology ==
The root system is shallow, even superficial, with large roots spreading out in all directions. European beech forms ectomycorrhizas with a range of fungi including many &quot;Russula&quot; species, as well as &quot;Laccaria amethystina&quot;, and with the species &quot;Ramaria flavosaponaria&quot;. &quot;Tomentella&quot; Pat. species and &quot;Cenococcum geophilum&quot; have been found in Danish and Spanish beech forests. These fungi are important in enhancing uptake of water and nutrients from the soil.

In the woodlands of southern Britain, beech is dominant over oak and elm south of a line from about north Suffolk across to Cardigan. Oak are the dominant forest trees north of this line. One of the most beautiful European beech forests called Sonian Forest (&quot;Forêt de Soignes/Zoniënwoud&quot;) is found in the southeast of Brussels, Belgium. Beech is a dominant tree species in France and constitutes about 10% of French forests. The largest virgin forests made of beech trees are Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh () in Ukraine and Izvoarele Nerei ( in one forest body) in Semenic-Cheile Carașului National Park, Romania. These habitats are the home of Europe&#x27;s largest predators, (the brown bear, the grey wolf and the lynx). Many trees are older than 350 years in Izvoarele Nerei and even 500 years in Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh.

Spring leaf budding by the European beech is triggered by a combination of day length and temperature. Bud break each year is from the middle of April to the beginning of May, often with remarkable precision (within a few days). It is more precise in the north of its range than the south, and at than at sea level.

The European beech invests significantly in summer and autumn for the following spring. Conditions in summer, particularly good rainfall, determine the number of leaves included in the buds. In autumn, the tree builds the reserves that will sustain it into spring. Given good conditions, a bud can produce a shoot with ten or more leaves. The terminal bud emits a hormonal substance in the spring that halts the development of additional buds. This tendency, though very strong at the beginning of their existence, becomes weaker in older trees.

It is only after the budding that root growth of the year begins. The first roots to appear are very thin (with a diameter of less than 0.5 mm). Later, after a wave of above ground growth, thicker roots grow in a steady fashion.

=== Diseases and pathogens ===

&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; and other beeches are prone to false heartwood (&#x27;red heart&#x27;) a condition where drought, nutrient deficient soil, branch breakage, pathogen infestation or other stressor induces formation of protection wood. False heartwood often manifests in the areas of the trunk associated with symplastless branches. As branch symplast dies, the trunk wood becomes depleted of nitrogen-containing molecules essential for life; this increases risk of catastrophic trunk failure.

As the European beech exhibits deterministic leaf and shoot development and has a larger leaf area than other European hardwood trees, it is relatively more sensitive to drought and may respond to a dry summer with pre-senescent leafdrop.

&quot;Biscogniauxia nummularia&quot; (beech tarcrust) is an ascomycete primary pathogen of beech trees, causing strip-canker and wood rot. It can be found at all times of year and is not edible.

== Cultivation ==

European beech is a very popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens in temperate regions of the world. In North America, they are preferred for this purpose over the native &quot;F. grandifolia&quot;, which despite its tolerance of warmer climates, is slower growing, taking an average of 10 years longer to attain maturity. The town of Brookline, Massachusetts has one of the largest, if not the largest, grove of European beech trees in the United States. The public park, called &#x27;The Longwood Mall&#x27;, was planted sometime before 1850 qualifying it as the oldest stand of European beeches in the United States.

It is frequently kept clipped to make attractive hedges.

Since the early 19th century there have been numerous cultivars of European beech made by horticultural selection, often repeatedly; they include:
*copper beech or purple beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica purpurea&quot;) – a mutation of the European beech which was first noted in 1690 in the &quot;Possenwald&quot; forest near the town of Sondershausen in Thuringia, Germany. It is assumed that about 99% of all copper beeches in the world are descendants of this copper beech. Its leaves are purple, in many selections turning deep spinach green by mid-summer. In the United States Charles Sprague Sargent noted the earliest appearance in a nurseryman&#x27;s catalogue in 1820, but in 1859 &quot;the finest copper beech in America... more than fifty feet high&quot; was noted in the grounds of Thomas Ash, Esq., Throggs Neck, New York; it must have been more than forty years old at the time.
*fern-leaf beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; Heterophylla Group) – leaves deeply serrated to thread-like
*dwarf beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; Tortuosa Group) – distinctive twisted trunk and branches
*weeping beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; Pendula Group) – branches pendulous
*Dawyck beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; &#x27;Dawyck&#x27;) – fastigiate (columnar) growth – occurs in green, gold and purple forms; named after Dawyck Botanic Garden in the Scottish Borders
*golden beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; &#x27;Zlatia&#x27;) – leaves golden in spring

===Cultivars===
The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:-

*&quot;F. sylvatica&quot; 
*&#x27;Dawyck&#x27;
*&#x27;Dawyck Gold&#x27;
*&#x27;Dawyck Purple&#x27;
*&#x27;Pendula&#x27; (weeping beech)
*&#x27;Riversii&#x27;
*&quot;F. sylvatica&quot; var. &quot;heterophylla&quot; &#x27;Aspleniifolia&#x27;
== Uses ==
The nuts are eaten by humans and animals. Slightly toxic to humans if eaten in large quantities due to the tannins and alkaloids they contain, the nuts were nonetheless pressed to obtain an oil in 19th-century England that was used for cooking and in lamps. They were also ground to make flour, which could be eaten after the tannins were leached out by soaking. Additionally, 
&quot;Primary Product AM 01&quot;, a smoke flavouring, is produced from &quot;Fagus sylvatica.&quot;

=== Timber ===
The wood of the European beech is used in the manufacture of numerous objects and implements. Its fine and short grain makes it an easy wood to work with, easy to soak, dye, varnish and glue. Steaming makes the wood even easier to machine. It has an excellent finish and is resistant to compression and splitting and it is stiff when flexed. Milling is sometimes difficult due to cracking. The density of the wood is per cubic metre. It is particularly well suited for minor carpentry, particularly furniture. From chairs to parquetry (flooring) and staircases, the European beech can do almost anything other than heavy structural support, so long as it is not left outdoors. Its hardness make it ideal for making wooden mallets and workbench tops. The wood rots easily if it is not protected by a tar based on a distillate of its own bark (as used in railway sleepers). It is better for paper pulp than many other broadleaved trees though is only sometimes used for this, the high cellulose content can also be spun into modal, which is used as a textile akin to cotton. The code for its use in Europe is (from &quot;FA&quot;gus &quot;SY&quot;lvatica). Common beech is also considered one of the best firewoods for fireplaces.

<doc id="437763" wikidata="Q153553" url="?curid=437763" title="Germania Superior">
<text>Germania Superior (&quot;Upper Germania&quot;) was an imperial province of the Roman Empire. It comprised an area of today&#x27;s western Switzerland, the French Jura and Alsace regions, and southwestern Germany. Important cities were Besançon (&quot;Vesontio&quot;), Strasbourg (&quot;Argentoratum&quot;), Wiesbaden (&quot;Aquae Mattiacae&quot;), and Germania Superior&#x27;s capital, Mainz (&quot;Mogontiacum&quot;). It comprised the Middle Rhine, bordering on the &quot;Limes Germanicus&quot;, and on the Alpine province of Raetia to the south-east. Although it had been occupied militarily since the reign of Augustus, Germania Superior (along with Germania Inferior) was not made into an official province until c. 85 AD.

==Origin==

===Initial Roman involvement===
The terms, &quot;Upper Germania&quot; and &quot;Lower Germania&quot; do not appear in the &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; of Julius Caesar, yet he writes about reports that the people who lived in those regions were referred to as &quot;Germani&quot; locally, a term used for a tribe that the Romans called the Germani cisrhenani, and that the name Germania seems to have been adopted to designate other indigenous tribes in the area. Lower Germania was occupied by the Belgae. Upper Germania was occupied by Gaulish tribes including the Helvetii, Sequani, Leuci, and Treveri, and, on the north bank of the middle Rhine, the remnant of the Germanic troops that had attempted to take Vesontio under Ariovistus, but who were defeated by Caesar in 58 BC.

The Romans did not abandon this region at any time after then. During a 5-year period in the initial years of his reign (28–23 BC), as Cassius Dio tells us (53.12), Augustus assumed direct governorship of the major senatorial provinces on grounds that they were in danger of insurrection and he alone commanded the troops required to restore security. They were to be restored to the Senate in ten years under proconsuls elected by the Senate.

Among these independent provinces was Upper Germania. Apparently it had become a province in the last years of the Roman Republic. Tacitus also mentions it as the province of Germania Superior in his &quot;Annales&quot; (3.41, 4.73, 13.53). Cassius Dio viewed the Germanic tribes as Celts, an impression given perhaps by Belgica, the name assigned to lower Germania at the time. Dio does not mention the border, but he views upper Germany as extending to the source of the Rhine. It is not clear if he was aware of the Upper Rhine in Switzerland, upstream from Lake Constance. Today the section of the Rhine running through upper Germania is called the middle Rhine.

===Limit of the empire===

Augustus had planned to incorporate all of central Germania in one province, Germania Magna. This plan was frustrated by the Germanic tribesmen at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Augustus decided to limit the empire at the Rhine-Danube border. Thereafter continual conflict prevailed along it, forcing the Romans to conduct punitive expeditions and fortify Germania Superior.

By 12 BC, major bases existed at Xanten (Castra Vetera) and Mainz (Mogontiacum), from which Drusus operated. A system of forts gradually developed around these bases. In 69–70, all the Roman fortications along the Rhine and Danube were destroyed by Germanic insurrections and civil war between the legions. At the conclusion of this violent but brief social storm they were rebuilt more extensively than before, with a road connecting Mainz and Augsburg (Augusta Vindelicorum).

Domitian went to war against the Chatti in 83–85, who were north of Frankfurt (in Hesse named after them). At this time the first line, or continuous fortified border, was constructed. It consisted of a cleared zone of observation, a palisade where practicable, wooden watchtowers and forts at the road crossings. At the end of the war against the Chatti Germania Superior was reestablished as an Imperial Roman province in 85, taking large amounts of territory from Gallia Lugdunensis. The Helvetii settlement area also became part of the province of &quot;Germania Superior&quot;.

The system reached maximum extent by 90. A Roman road went through the Odenwald and a network of secondary roads connected all the forts and towers. The future Emperor Trajan ruled the province from 96 until his accession in 98. 

===Defensive strategy===

The plan governing the development of the limes was relatively simple. From a strategic point of view, the Agri Decumates, or region between the Rhine and Danube, offers a bulge in the line between the Celts and the Germanics, which the Germanics had tried to exploit under Ariovistus. The bulge divided the densely populated Celtic settlements along the entire river system in two. Invading forces could move up under cover of the Black Forest. Roman defensive works therefore cut across the base of the bulge, denying the protected corridor and shortening the line.

The key point was the shoulder of the bulge at Mogontiacum (Mainz) where the &quot;masse de manoevre&quot; or strategic reserves were located. The forts through the forest were relatively lightly defended and on that account were always being burned by the Alamanni. They gave advance notice, however. On being notified, the legions would strike out in preventative and punitive expeditions from Mainz or Strasburg, or Augsburg on the other side.

The entire system could only succeed if heavy troop concentrations were kept at Mainz. Fixed defenses alone are not much of a defense, in either ancient or modern times. Other forces are required for attack. At best the fixed defenses serve to warn or delay until a counterattack can be launched. For more complete details on the development of the limes, or frontier, see &quot;Limes Germanicus&quot;.

In the subsequent peaceful years, the limes lost its temporary character. Vici, or communities, developed around the forts. By 150, the towers and the bases had been rebuilt in stone. The soldiers now lived in good stone barracks within walls decorated by frescoes. Germanic civilization had changed as well. Where Caesar had described burning the wretched brush hovels of the Suebi who had come to fight for Ariovistus, the Chatti and the Alamanni now lived in comfortable Romanized villages around the limes.

==End of the province==
Post 400, as Rome slowly was losing control over its northernmost provinces over a period of 50 years, the southern (Swiss) parts of Germania Superior were incorporated into the Provincia Maxima Sequanorum before they became part of Burgundy in the early 5th century. The northern parts became part of Alemannia.

<text>Cryptomeria (literally &quot;hidden parts&quot;) is a monotypic genus of conifer in the cypress family Cupressaceae. It includes only one species, Cryptomeria japonica (syn. &quot;Cupressus japonica&quot; L.f.). It is considered to be endemic to Japan, where it is known as . The tree is called Japanese [[Cedar (plant)|cedar]] or Japanese [[redwood]] in English. It has been extensively introduced and cultivated for wood production on the Azores.

==Description==

&quot;Cryptomeria&quot; is a very large evergreen tree, reaching up to tall and trunk diameter, with red-brown bark which peels in vertical strips. The leaves are arranged spirally, needle-like, long; and the seed cones globular, diameter with about 20–40 scales. It is superficially similar to the related giant sequoia (&quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot;), from which it can be differentiated by the longer leaves (under in the giant sequoia) and smaller cones ( in the giant sequoia), and the harder bark on the trunk (thick, soft and spongy in giant sequoia).

==Endemism==
Sugi has been cultivated in China for so long that it is frequently thought to be native there. Forms selected for ornament and timber production long ago in China have been described as a distinct variety &quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot; var. &quot;sinensis&quot; (or even a distinct species, &quot;Cryptomeria fortunei&quot;), but they do not differ from the full range of variation found in the wild in Japan, and there is no definite evidence the species ever occurred wild in China. Genetic analysis of the most famous Chinese population, on Tianmu Mountain, containing trees estimated to be nearly 1000 years old, supports the hypothesis that the population originates from an introduction.

Outside of its native range, &quot;Cryptomeria&quot; was also introduced to the Azores in the mid 19th century for wood production. It is currently the most cultivated species in the archipelago, occupying over 12,698 hectares, 60% of the production forest and about 1/5 of the region&#x27;s total land area.

==Biology==
&quot;Cryptomeria&quot; grows in forests on deep, well-drained soils subject to warm, moist conditions, and it is fast-growing under these conditions. It is intolerant of poor soils and cold, drier climates.

It is used as a food plant by the larvae of some moths of the genus &quot;Endoclita&quot; including &quot;E. auratus&quot;, &quot;E. punctimargo&quot; and &quot;E. undulifer&quot;. Sugi (and hinoki) pollen is a major cause of hay fever in Japan.

==Fossil record==
The earliest fossil record of &quot;Cryptomeria&quot; are descriptions based on vegetative organs of †&quot;Cryptomeria kamtschatica&quot; of the Late Eocene from Kamchatka, Russia and †&quot;Cryptomeria protojaponica&quot; and †&quot;Cryptomeria sichotensis&quot; from the Oligocene of Primorye, Russia. Several fossil leafy shoots of †&quot;Cryptomeria yunnanensis&quot; have been described from Rupelian stage strata of the Lühe Basin in Yunnan, China.

From the Neogene, &quot;Cryptomeria&quot; is well represented as seed cones, leafy shoots and wood in the fossil records of Europe and Japan. †&quot;Cryptomeria rhenana&quot; was described from the early Late Miocene to the Late Miocene of Rhein in Morsbach, Germany, from the Early and Middle Pliocene of Northern Italy, to the Middle Pliocene of Dunarobba, Italy and to the Early Pleistocene of Umbria, Italy. †&quot;Cryptomeria anglica&quot; was described from the Late Miocene of La Cerdana, Spain, to the Late Middle Miocene of Brjánslækur, Iceland and from the Late Miocene to the early Pliocene Brassington Formation of Derbyshire, England. †&quot;Cryptomeria miyataensis&quot; was described from the Late Miocene of Akita, Japan. &quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot; was described from the Late Miocene of Georgia and from the Pliocene of Duab, Abkhazia. It has also been described from the Pliocene of Honshu, Japan, Late Pliocene of Osaka, Japan and from the Pleistocene of Kyushu, Japan.

==Cultivation==
===Timber===

&quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot; timber is extremely fragrant, weather and insect resistant, soft, and with a low density. The timber is used for the making of staves, tubs, casks, furniture and other indoor applications. Easy to saw and season, it is favoured for light construction, boxes, veneers and plywood. Wood that has been buried turns dark green and is much valued. Resin from the tree contains cryptopimaric and phenolic acid.

The wood is pleasantly scented, reddish-pink in colour, lightweight but strong, waterproof and resistant to decay. It is favoured in Japan for all types of construction work as well as interior panelling, etc. In Darjeeling district and Sikkim in India, where it is one of the most widely growing trees, &quot;C. japonica&quot; is called &quot;Dhuppi&quot; and is favoured for its light wood, extensively used in house building.

In Japan, the coppicing method of &quot;daisugi&quot; (台杉) is sometimes used to harvest logs.

====Mechanical properties====
In dry air conditions, the initial density of Japanese cedar timber has been determined to be about 300–420 kg/m3.
It displays a Young&#x27;s modulus of 8017 MPa, 753 MPa and 275 MPa in the longitudinal, radial and tangential direction in relation to the wood fibers.

===Ornamental===
&quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot; is extensively used in forestry plantations in Japan, China and the Azores islands, and is widely cultivated as an ornamental tree in other temperate areas, including Britain, Europe, North America and eastern Himalaya regions of Nepal and India.

The cultivar &#x27;Elegans&#x27; is notable for retaining juvenile foliage throughout its life, instead of developing normal adult foliage when one year old (see the picture with different shoots). It makes a small, shrubby tree tall. There are numerous dwarf cultivars that are widely used in rock gardens and for bonsai, including &#x27;Tansu&#x27;, &#x27;Koshyi&#x27;, &#x27;Little Diamond&#x27;, &#x27;Yokohama&#x27; and &#x27;Kilmacurragh.&#x27;

The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017):
* &quot;C. japonica&quot; &#x27;Bandai-sugi&#x27;
* &quot;C. japonica&quot; &#x27;Elegans Compacta&#x27;
* &quot;C. japonica&quot; &#x27;Elegans Viridis&#x27;
* &quot;C. japonica&quot; &#x27;Globosa Nana&#x27;
* &quot;C. japonica&quot; &#x27;Golden Promise&#x27;
* &quot;C. japonica&quot; &#x27;Sekkan-sugi&#x27;
* &quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot; &#x27;Spiralis&#x27; 
* &quot;C. japonica&quot; &#x27;Vilmoriniana&#x27;

==Symbolism==
Sugi is commonly planted around temples and shrines, with many hugely impressive trees planted centuries ago. Sargent (1894; &quot;The Forest Flora of Japan&quot;) recorded the instance of a &quot;daimyō&quot; (feudal lord) who was too poor to donate a stone lantern at the funeral of the &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616) at Nikkō Tōshō-gū, but requested instead to be allowed to plant an avenue of sugi, so that &quot;future visitors might be protected from the heat of the sun&quot;. The offer was accepted; the Cedar Avenue of Nikkō, which still exists, is over long, and &quot;has not its equal in stately grandeur&quot;.

 is a large cryptomeria tree located on Yakushima, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in Japan. It is the oldest and largest among the old-growth cryptomeria trees on the island, and is estimated to be between 2,170 and 7,200 years old.

Cryptomeria are often described and referred to in Japanese literature. For instance, cryptomeria forests and their workers, located on the mountains north of Kyoto, are featured in Yasunari Kawabata&#x27;s famous book &quot;The Old Capital&quot;.

<text>In psychiatry and psychology, euthymia is a normal, tranquil mental state or mood. People with mood disorders, including major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, experience euthymia as a stable mood state that is neither depressive nor manic. Achieving and maintaining euthymia is the goal of treatment for bipolar patients in particular.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;euthymia&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;eu&quot; and &quot;thymos&quot; . The word “thymos” had four meanings: life energy, feelings/passions, desire/will, and thought/intelligence; and was also tied to the social dimension e.g. seeking honor from others. The verb form &quot;euthymeo” meant both “I am happy, in good spirits” and “I make others happy, I reassure and encourage”. 

Democritus, who coined the philosophical concept of euthymia, said that euthymia is achieved when &quot;one is satisfied with what is present and available, taking little heed of people who are envied and admired and observing the lives of those who suffer and yet endure&quot;. This was later amended in the translation given by the Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger in which euthymia means a state of internal calm and contentment. Seneca was also the first to link the state of euthymia to a learning process; in order to achieve it, one must be aware of psychological well-being. Seneca’s definition included a caveat about detachment from current events. Later, the Greek biographer Plutarch removed this caveat with his definition which focused more on learning from adverse events.

== History ==
In 1958, Marie Jahoda gave a modern clinical definition of mental health in the terms of positive symptoms by outlining the criteria for mental health: &quot;autonomy (regulation of behavior from within), environmental mastery, satisfactory interactions with other people and the milieu, the individual’s style and degree of growth, development or self-actualization, the attitudes of an individual toward his/her own self&quot;. In her definition she acknowledged the absence of disease as being necessary, but not enough, to constitute positive mental health, or euthymia.

=== Expansion of clinical concept ===
The traditional clinical concept of &quot;euthymia&quot; is an absence of disorder. This turns out to be insufficient: patients considered to be in remission, i.e. not displaying symptoms meeting the threshold for diagnosis, still show impairments in psychological well-being compared to healthy subjects.

Carol Ryff (1989) was the first to develop a comprehensive scale that could assess euthymia: the six-factor model of psychological well-being. The 84-item scale includes facets of self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth. Garamoni et al (1991) described euthymia as having a balance between the positive and negative in six dimensions of cognition and affects similar to the Ryff factors. Having too much positivity in one factor is not euthymia: for example, a person with too little &quot;purpose in life&quot; would lack a sense of meaning in life, while one with too much would have unrealistic expectations and hopes.

The concept of resilience (or, resistance to stress) was added again in the 2000s by authors in the field. Fava and Bech (2016)&#x27;s definition can be seen as a modern example:
* Lack of mood disturbances. As with the older clinical sense, full remission from past mood disorder. If there is any sadness, anxiety, or irritable mood, it should be short-lived and possible to be interrupted.
* Positive affects. Cheerfulness, relaxation, interest in things, plus restorative sleep.
* Psychological well-being. Flexibility (balance of psychic forces, similar to Garamoni), consistency (a unifying outlook on life), resillance (resistance to stress), and tolerance to anxiety and frustration.

=== Medical applications of the expanded concept ===
In 1987, Kellner R published the &quot;Symptom Questionnaire&quot;, containing 24 items referring to positive feelings and 68 referring to the negative. With the inclusion of positive feelings such as relaxation and friendliness, the SQ was found to be more sensitive to the effects of psychotrophic medication. A number of other scales, such as the WHO-5, PWB, AAQ-II, CIE, have been developed to also measure the positive side of euthymia.

Macro-analysis and micro-analysis are techniques used by clinicians to combine the assessments of psychological well-being and distress. Using both fields may offer more insight into the planning of treatment: for example, well-being therapy (WBT) can be used to help a patient self-observe and increase periods of well-being, while cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be used to target distress. Other therapies that focus on aspects of well-being include mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) which focus on flexibility, and the less-proven Pedasky and Mooney&#x27;s strengths-based CBT and forgiveness therapy.

A few clinical trials have been done using a sequential model, where patients who have responded to antidepressants are tapered off the drug and then given a combination cognitive-wellbeing therapy. Although the results have been impressive with regard to relapse rates, it is unclear how much is due to this added well-being component. In a different trial setup, anxiety patients who have responded to behavioral theapy and mood disorder patients who have responded to medication are assigned to either CBT or WBT for residual symptoms. While both achieved a significant reduction of symptoms, WBT provided more benefit in terms of observer rating and PWB scores. WBT may also be applicable to cyclothymic disorder. MBCT seem to be an effective add-on to treatment-as-usual in treatment-resistant depression.

<doc id="437776" wikidata="Q149734" url="?curid=437776" title="Peace of Bautzen">
<text>The Peace of Bautzen (; ; ) was a treaty concluded on 30 January 1018, between Holy Roman Emperor Henry II and Bolesław I of Poland which ended a series of Polish-German wars over the control of Lusatia and Upper Lusatia (&quot;Milzenerland&quot; or &quot;Milsko&quot;, the eastern part of the margraviate of Meissen (&quot;Miśnia&quot;)) as well as Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia.

Bolesław had enjoyed the close friendship of the emperor Otto III and after his death supported one of Otto&#x27;s followers, Eckard I, Margrave of Meissen for the position of Holy Roman Emperor, against the claims of Henry II. After both emperor Otto III and Eckard&#x27;s death in 1002, Bolesław conquered Eckard&#x27;s domain of Meissen, as well as the march of Lusatia. Once Henry secured his position within Germany, an agreement was reached which left Bolesław with Lusatia and Upper Lusatia while the Polish duke in turn recognized Henry as Holy Roman Emperor.

Fighting soon resumed, however, after an unsuccessful assassination attempt against Bolesław—which he believed had been ordered by Henry, who denied the charge—occurred soon after the peace was concluded. Bolesław took control of Bohemia, having previously acquired Moravia and Slovakia. In the ensuing struggle Bolesław allied himself with the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s noble opposition to Henry, while the emperor sought support among the Lutici, a Slavic pagan Polabian tribe. An intermediate peace was concluded in Merseburg in 1013 which preserved the territorial status quo, with Bolesław holding on to Moravia and Slovakia, while Jaromir was made the ruler of Bohemia (though he was soon deposed by his brother Oldrich). Bolesław however agreed to support the Emperor&#x27;s Italian campaign. Open warfare continued when Bolesław I did not comply with this condition, and instead supported Henry II&#x27;s Italian adversaries. Henry II was however unable to defeat Bolesław I, and agreed on a peace in Bautzen (1018) which left the Duke of Poland in charge of the Lusatian march and Upper Lusatia. The two rulers also strengthened the dynastic bonds between them through Bolesław&#x27;s marriage with Oda, first daughter of Margrave Eckard. The emperor also promised to aid Bolesław in his intervention in the Kievan succession crisis in the summer of 1018 with contingents of German and Hungarian troops which enabled the Polish ruler to capture Kiev and reclaim the previously lost Cherven Cities.

==Prelude==

=== Merseburg (1002) ===

After the death of emperor Otto III, Bavarian duke Henry IV and Meissen margrave Eckard (Ekkehard) I competed for succession. When Eckard I was murdered on 30 April 1002 in Pöhlde, Polish duke Bolesław I, who had supported Eckard&#x27;s candidature, took over the Margraviate of Meissen and March Lusatia (Lower Lusatia), lands only recently conquered by Germans and still inhabited mostly by Slavs, probably with approval from Eckard&#x27;s family. He took control of both Bautzen and Meissen, after the inhabitants themselves had forced the German troops to leave the city, while other German knights voluntarily recognized Bolesław&#x27;s rule in the region. Meanwhile, Henry IV had consolidated his rule against rival candidates, and, as Henry II, was crowned king of Germany in June.

On 25 July 1002 at a &quot;Hoftag&quot; (imperial meeting) held in Merseburg, the dispute was settled as follows:
*Henry II gave the Lusatian march and the eastern part of the Meissen march (&quot;Milsko&quot; or &quot;Milzenerland&quot;, Upper Lusatia) to Bolesław I as a fief, 
*Bolesław I had to return the truncated Margraviate of Meissen, 
*Bolesław I pledged allegiance to Henry II together with the Saxon nobles.

When Bolesław I left Merseburg, he was ambushed, but due to the aid of Henry of Schweinfurt and Saxon duke Bernard (Bernhard) I, he was able to repulse the attack. Henry II did neither protect him, nor punish the assailants.

=== Poznań (1005) ===

In 1003, Bolesław I conquered the Duchy of Bohemia, imprisoned its Přemyslid duke, Boleslaus III, and denied Henry II the oath of allegiance for the duchy. Henry II did not accept this, and was determined to contest the Polish claims to the Bohemian duchy. Bolesław I had further allied with the noble German opposition to Henry II. This alliance included Henry of Schweinfurt, his cousin Ernst as well as Henry II&#x27;s brother Brun (Bruno), bishop of Augsburg, all of which fled to Bolesław&#x27;s court when their rebellion against Henry II failed. While Bolesław I could draw upon the support of many secular Saxon nobles, Henry II could rely on the Saxon clergy. Also in 1003, Henry II allied with the pagan Lutici against Bolesław I, and in 1004 launched a campaign against the latter. In the course of this campaign, Henry II evicted Bolesław I from Bohemia and granted it to the Přemyslid duke Jaromir in 1004, before he besieged and took Bautzen from Bolesław I&#x27;s forces and incorporated it into the Duchy of Saxony. A few months later, together with Veleti and Czech allies, Henry II mounted another campaign. He crossed the Oder near Krosno and advanced into Greater Poland. Bolesław however avoided an open battle, harried the emperor&#x27;s troops with guerrilla tactics and caused &quot;great losses&quot;, according to contemporary German chroniclers. The fighting was concluded in 1005 when Tagino, Archbishop of Magdeburg mediated a peace near Poznań, as a result of which Poland had to give up Lusatia and Meissen but kept Slovakia and Moravia for the time being.

The peace was temporary, as neither was Henry II ready to grant Bolesław I a more elevated status than the one of an ordinary vassal, nor did the latter abandon his desire for such a position or accept Henry II&#x27;s power as immediate to God, as his self-perception was similar in this respect.

===Merseburg (1013)===
Despite the peace of Poznan, warfare between Bolesław I and Henry II continued between 1007 and 1013. In 1007, Bolesław I again took control of Lusatia with the fortress of Bautzen. A campaign led by Henry II in 1010 was unsuccessful. During this campaign, which started in Belgern, Henry II was struck by an illness at Jarina castle and returned with some of his bishops, while the remaining armies devastated the surrounding area. A Saxon campaign in 1012 was also unsuccessful. Henry II had mobilized the Saxon nobility to mount campaigns in his name, since he needed a peace agreement before 1013, when his coronation in Rome was scheduled.

Thus, in 1013, Bolesław I and Henry II agreed on a peace in Merseburg:
*Henry II again gave the Lusatian march and Upper Lusatia to Bolesław I as a fief, 
*Bolesław I again pledged allegiance to Henry II,
*Bolesław I promised to support Henry II&#x27;s campaign to Rome,
*Henry II promised to support Bolesław I&#x27;s campaign to Kiev with 500 knights.

The treaty was confirmed by the marriage of Richeza, a niece of Otto III, to Mieszko II, a son of Bolesław I. During the ceremony Bolesław I carried the sword for Henry II.

Bolesław I however did not aid Henry II in his Italian campaign, and refused to recognize that Lusatia and Upper Lusatia were his only as fiefs. Instead, he supported Crescentian antipope Gregory VI and intrigued against Henry II in Italy, who had denied Gregory his support in Pöhlde. Henry II started his Italian campaign in the fall of 1013, defeated the allies of the Crescentians and had pope Benedict VIII crown him Holy Roman Emperor in Rome on 14 February 1014. Bohemian duke Oldřich meanwhile captured Bolesław I&#x27;s son, Mieszko, and turned him over to Henry II, who however released him.

==Bautzen (1018)==

===Military operations and political background===
In July 1015, Henry II with his Lutician allies renewed the war against Bolesław I on the basis of the latter&#x27;s failure to support him in Italy. The campaign started in Magdeburg, from where Henry II&#x27;s army crossed through Lusatia to Krosno, where two other armies commanded by Bernard II of Saxony and Oldřich of Bohemia were supposed to join him. The plan failed however, as Bolesław&#x27;s maneuvers prevented the two armies from joining up. During the fighting Margrave Gero, as well as two hundred other German knights were killed by Polish bowmen and Bolesław allowed the Bishop of Meissen, Eido, to recover the bodies for burial. As a result of these setbacks Henry II withdrew. Subsequent negotiations with Bolesław I failed. In 1017, Henry II marched an army from Leitzkau to Głogów, where Bolesław I awaited him, but chose not to besiege the city as it was too strongly fortified. Instead Henry besieged nearby Niemcza, however, Polish reinforcements managed to enter the city on two occasions and the siege was without success. The contemporary German chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg, generally ill-disposed towards Poles, on this occasion commented on the bravery and skill of the defenders, noting that they neither cheered when they were successful, nor lamented when they suffered a setback. The inhabitants of the city also erected a cross on the wall which faced the pagan Lutician allies of the emperor. Eventually, due to an illness of part of his army Henry aborted the siege and withdrew, taking the route to Bohemia because the way back into Germany was blocked by Boleslaw&#x27;s main forces, stationed at Wrocław.
During these campaigns, Henry II was confronted with the opposition of part of the Saxon nobility, including the House of Billung, who maintained good relations and were in part relatives of Bolesław I. In 1017, Henry II therefore addressed Bolesław I as &quot;public enemy&quot; (&quot;hostis publicus&quot;) and forbade further contacts with him. At the end of 1017, Polish troops invaded German land between the Mulde and Elbe rivers.

===The treaty===
On 30 January 1018, peace was made in Budziszyn (now &quot;Bautzen&quot;). Bolesław I kept the Lusatian march and Upper Lusatia (&quot;Milsko/Milzenerland&quot;). Thietmar, the principal German chronicler of the time, did not give precise details as to the conditions on which Bolesław retained these lands. According to German historian Schneidmuller, he held them as an imperial fief. According to Polish historian Paweł Jasienica, the lands were held without any obligation towards the empire. The Cambridge Medieval History states that they were Bolesław&#x27;s on &quot;purely nominal terms of vassalage&quot;.

The contemporary German chronicler Thietmar, who was generally ill-disposed towards Poles, commented on the peace with the words &quot;non ut decuit sed sicut fieri potuit&quot;, meaning &quot;not as it should have been but as was possible in the circumstances&quot;.

Both parties also exchanged hostages. Henry II did not attend, and did not renew the campaigns against Bolesław I thereafter. The peace was confirmed by the marriage of Oda of Meissen, daughter of Eckard I, to Bolesław I. It was Bolesław I&#x27;s fourth marriage; Regelind, a daughter from his previous marriage with Emnilda, was already married to Oda&#x27;s brother Herman I of Meissen.

Henry also obliged himself to support Bolesław with three hundred knights in the Polish ruler&#x27;s expedition to Kiev in the same year.
