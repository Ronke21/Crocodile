<text>Limehouse Basin is a body of water 2 miles east of London Bridge that is also a navigable link between the River Thames and two of London&#x27;s canals. First dug in 1820 as the eastern terminus of the new Regent&#x27;s Canal, its wet area was less than originally, but it was gradually enlarged in the Victorian era, reaching a maximum of double that size, when it was given its characteristic oblique entrance lock, big enough to admit 2,000-ton ships.

Throughout its working life the basin was better known as the Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock, and was used to transship goods between the old Port of London and the English canal system. Cargoes handled were chiefly coal and timber, but also ice, and even circus animals, Russian oil and First World War submarines. Sailing ships delivered cargoes there until the Second World War, and can be seen in surviving films and paintings. The dock closed for transshipment in 1969 and eventually passed into disuse. Following closure of the basin and much of the wider London docks, the surroundings were redeveloped for housing and leisure in the late 20th century. Sometimes now referred to as the Limehouse Marina, the Basin lies between the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) line and historic Narrow Street; the Limehouse Link tunnel passes beneath. Directly to the east is Ropemaker&#x27;s Fields, a small park.

==History==
===Reasons for construction===
====Fuel for London; Thames congestion====
To warm their homes and cook their food Londoners at one time burned wood, but local woodlands, though managed as renewable resources, could not keep up with the rising demand. Thus by the 18th century the town&#x27;s fuel was chiefly coal, imported from Newcastle upon Tyne by sea — hence, &quot;sea coal&quot;. It was transported in colliers, typically small brigs. Because voyages could be extremely hazardous, these were built for strength, &quot;certainly not for looks&quot;.

Arriving in the Thames, a collier tried to find a mooring in the highly congested Pool of London. Once moored, a fleet of small barges, called lighters, relieved her of her cargo. But these lighters were used as floating warehouses, perhaps taking a long time to unload. They attracted &quot;River-Pirates, Night-Plunderers, Lightermen, Burgemen, Watermen, Bumboatmen, and Peter-Boatmen&quot;, to the point that rivermen rarely paid for their coals, or so said Patrick Colquhoun, founder of the Thames River Police.

====Linking Port to English canal system====
Some inland towns depended on the English canal system for their coals, yet access from the Pool of London was difficult, the nearest Thames link being at Brentford. The Regent&#x27;s Canal Company proposed to tackle this problem by digging their canal to skirt round existing London to the north. Horse-towed barges would convey goods from Limehouse to the Paddington Branch of the Grand Union Canal (opened 1801), and onwards. &quot;The Regent&#x27;s Canal was intended to and still does bring the Thames into watery contact with, say, Birmingham&quot;. Later, it was sometimes found cheaper to import coal in the opposite direction. The Newcastle mine owners were in a cartel to keep up prices and, when they went too far, midland coalfields sent their produce to London down the Regent&#x27;s Canal.

Where a canal joined a tidal river there was usually a small basin where barges could wait for the right state of the tide to go over. The Regent&#x27;s Canal Company, short of capital, thought it would be enough to provide a small 1 acre basin of that sort at Limehouse. However, they were converted to a bolder idea: making it big enough to receive the Newcastle sailing colliers themselves, which could then unload at their convenience.

===The Basin: original 1820 version===
The chief engineer was James Morgan and the contractor was Hugh McIntosh; the basin&#x27;s wet area was 4 acres.

The basin formally opened on 1 August 1820. The Regent&#x27;s Canal entered the basin through the Commercial Road Lock, which is still in use.

The original basin was rudimentary. It was not faced with stone or brick but, to save disposal of spoil, had earthen banks gradually sloping down to the bottom, which was below Trinity High Water. Since ships could not get alongside to moor there were wooden jetties for discharging goods to local merchants, but they had been built too high. There were not enough mooring buoys.

The Basin was gradually enlarged in the 19th century by digging east and southeast (see below). At the century&#x27;s end parts of the west and north banks were sloping still.

====Thames entrance====
The Basin was dug some distance inland, since the riverfront was built up. It was connected to the Thames by a short canal that was crossed by two streets. It had a pound lock, and could admit ships of about 10 metres . (This canal outlet ran more or less where Horseferry Road does today as it joins Narrow Street.) Traffic on Narrow Street crossed the canal by a swing bridge, which could pivot out to let vessels pass, driven by labourers who worked capstans (see artist&#x27;s impression).

The canal outlet was made nearly square-on to the river, but it turned out to be a bad choice. When ships were trying to dock or undock, the local set of the tide flowed crossways, making it very difficult. In the first five months&#x27; service only 15 loaded ships entered the dock.

Not only ships, but already-laden barges entered the Basin from the Thames.

====Not the first Limehouse basin====
Limehouse Basin was the third structure of that name in London. In any case half of it lay in the parish of Ratcliff, not Limehouse. Hence throughout its working life it was better known as the Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock; its &quot;RCD&quot; flag can be seen in the 1826 artist&#x27;s impression.

====Muscle power: coal-whipping====
Coal was unloaded in the Basin from ships to barges. Until 1853 it was done entirely by human muscle power in a method called &quot;whipping&quot;. Four men down in the ship&#x27;s hold put lumps of coal into a basket as fast as they could. Up on deck, another four men, when they guessed the basket should be full, ran up a crude ladder and jumped down onto the deck simultaneously, each throwing his weight onto a rope passing over a pulley: this jerked (or &quot;whipped&quot;) the basket out of the hold. Keeping up the momentum, a ninth man tipped the contents into a weighing machine which shot them into a barge. The whole thing was done in silence. A nine-man gang was expected to unload 49 tons of a coal a day; more often, according to Henry Mayhew, they achieved double that amount — during which each rope man climbed a total distance of nearly 1 vertical miles — and sometimes more.

===Modifications and success===
The proprietors soon fixed the teething troubles about the jetties and mooring buoys and the project became a success. By 1830, twenty to fifty vessels were entering or leaving the basin on each tide, typical large users being the London gasworks companies.

To cope with the currents a timber structure was erected to protect vessels being driven sideways (illustration). Nevertheless, wrote engineer John Baldry Redman in 1848, the entrance bore &quot;a very bad character&quot;.

The London and Blackwall Railway arrived in 1840. Built on a viaduct, its arches skirted the northern edge of the dock, sometimes actually crossing the water. Thus the dock included a small basin on the other side of the railway line where barges could enter; it was not filled in until 1926. The railway continued to carry passengers until 1922 and goods until 1964, when it was abandoned, and was in danger of demolition, but its &quot;fine&quot; arches (by Robert Stephenson and George Bidder) were preserved as a listed building; today, they are used by the Docklands Light Railway.

The dock was enlarged several times (by 1848 the water area was 8 or 9 acres) and, in 1849, to cope with increasing congestion, a second outlet to the river was made for barge traffic.

In 1851 severe competition arrived: the railway companies penetrated the coal trade. Not only was coal from Yorkshire and the Midlands carried direct to King&#x27;s Cross by the Great Northern Railway, but the North London Railway opened a line to the West India Docks, whose Poplar Dock could handle the latest large, efficient twin-screw steam colliers.

In Limehouse Basin, human muscle could not unload coal fast enough; electrical power was not yet practical; so in 1853 hydraulic power was fitted. Energy was stored in hydraulic accumulators (a heavy weight on a water column driven up a tower by a steam engine), a cutting edge technology at the time. It drove hydraulic cranes.

===Mid-Victorian improvements (1870)===
By 1865, the Basin was overcrowded. The old ship canal was not wide enough for the big steam colliers that were winning the business. It was the only dock entrance in London too narrow to admit the Fire Brigade&#x27;s floating engine (a paddle-wheeler). A major scheme of improvements was carried out. The work was done by the Company&#x27;s own employees under their chief engineer, Edwin Thomas.

The wet area was increased to 10 acres, the most it ever attained. A new river wall was erected. Meanwhile, it was business as usual, for the shipping traffic continued to come and go, floating in the old basin while protected by an earthen dam (see illustration).

====Ship lock====
The most important innovation was the new ship lock, which was wide, and built slantwise to avoid the previous troubles. It was 8 metres deep over the sills. Major parts were made of Bramley Fall stone or Cornish granite. It could admit sea-going vessels of 2,000 tons net register, far more than would be possible now (today&#x27;s lock is built inside the 1869 original). It was a two-compartment lock, and hence there were three lock gates, each formed by a pair of leaves. Each 80-ton gate leaf rested on a massive granite pivot stone. Most of those stones — with their telltale circular depressions — have been preserved, and today are laid out on display on the western side of the Basin.

Limehouse Basin now had three entrances from the Thames. The old ship lock was closed off by 1880, but the barge lock continued to exist until about 1924.

====The accumulator tower====
To work the heavy lock gates, hydraulic power was used; it also worked the swing bridge over Narrow Street, and continued to power the hydraulic cranes. For this purpose a new hydraulic accumulator was built with an unusual octagonal brick tower.

In 1973, investigators found the remains of the tower and at first mistook it for a railway signalling installation. It is now recognised as one of the oldest surviving accumulator towers in the world and is a Grade II listed building, being open every year during Open House Weekend.

===Jobs===
Alan H. Faulkner wrote that in 1907 Limehouse Basin employed (amongst others) a dock master, six policemen, thirteen crane drivers, and a diver and his mate.

===Exotic cargoes and transport===
The Company made efforts to diversify the dock&#x27;s trade beyond coal and timber and attracted miscellaneous shipping.

====Edible ice====

Before mechanical refrigeration was commonplace, Limehouse Basin was a centre for the importation of high grade ice, in demand by caterers, confectioners and hospitals. Ice, pure enough for human consumption, was cut in blocks from frozen Norwegian lakes, shipped to Limehouse Basin, and stored in ice wells located near the Regent&#x27;s Canal. The first to do this was William Leftwich. His enormous Park Crescent West ice well near Regent&#x27;s Park has been rediscovered recently under the streets of Marylebone. He built ice wells in Cumberland Market and Camden Market, also supplied by the Regent&#x27;s Canal from Limehouse Basin, One, the deepest ever dug, survives to this day.

Ice cream was a luxury for the well-to-do until Carlo Gatti introduced it to Londoners as street food — his penny ices. He built two ice wells at Kings Cross; one of them can be visited at the London Canal Museum. Gatti&#x27;s depot was on the north-east side of Limehouse Basin for many years. At least 15 ice ships a year were still arriving there in 1912.

Ice had six different medical uses at the East End&#x27;s London Hospital wrote their Matron, Eva Luckes. At one time it was commended as a safer anaesthetic than chloroform for &quot;minor&quot; amputations e.g. finger removals.

====Cruises to Liverpool====
In the Victorian era there was a weekly passenger service from Limehouse Basin to Liverpool; the round trip could be booked as a holiday cruise. Leaving on Saturday mornings, ships steamed round the west coast calling at Plymouth and Falmouth arriving in the Mersey on Wednesdays. The fare was £1 plus meals. One who had tried it said it was not recommendable during the equinoctial gales. Another said there were cabins but a passenger might have to sleep in the lifeboat.

====Oil tankers====

Some of the earliest practical oil tankers — before those evolved, ships routinely transported oil in barrels — docked in the Limehouse Basin in 1886. One was the innovative oil-fired Russian steamer &quot;Sviet&quot; with petroleum from the Baku oilfields; another was the American &quot;Crusader&quot; a wooden sailing tanker. The ships were designed to pump out their cargo quickly, saving valuable docking time, but could not do so at Limehouse Basin, because there were no bulk storage facilities. It had to be piped overland to barges in Limehouse Cut.


====Circus animals====
The Limehouse Basin between the wars was used to import animals — including lions, tigers, elephants, polar bears and sea lions — on their way to the London and provincial circuses. Once, 14 tigers arrived in one batch.

====Submarines====
After the First World War 25 German submarines were towed into Limehouse Basin and broken up by scrap merchants George Cohen &amp; Sons, whose business was located between Commercial Road lock and the station.

====Oranges====
Near present-day Medland House in the 1920s were electric cranes for handling fruit cargoes from Spain.

====20th-century sailing ships====
The use of sailing ships to deliver timber at Limehouse Basin continued up to WW2. Labour-intensive, it was financially viable because most crewmen were youths who were paid no wages. The ships can be seen in films of the silent era; a painting at the National Maritime Museum by Norman Janes shows three 3-masted sailing vessels there at the same time.

The Regent&#x27;s Canal dock had its own customs house. The latest was built around 1905-10, and stood on the river side of the Thames lock. Today, it is a listed building, and is used as a Gordon Ramsay gastropub.

===Relation with Limehouse Cut===
Limehouse Cut to the east — an older canal that conveyed grain traffic from the River Lea and had its own basin and exit to the Thames — had no historic connection with the Regent&#x27;s Canal. In 1854, however, there was talk of a takeover and a link was dug to Limehouse Basin. The takeover was opposed by bargemen on the rivers Lea and Stort who did not like being under Regent&#x27;s Canal regulations. The proposal was defeated and in 1864 the link was filled in.

Apart from that brief interlude there was no connection between Limehouse Basin and the Cut for another hundred years, although some old maps may suggest otherwise.

In 1968 Limehouse Cut&#x27;s old Thames exit was stopped up and, by cutting a 200 foot (60 metre) channel, it was made to discharge directly into Limehouse Basin. (The new link ran north of what is now Victory Place. The old link had run to the south of the site.)

===Lifeboats===
The Victorian era&#x27;s lifeboats, sponsored by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, were built nearby on the Limehouse Cut at Forrestt&#x27;s boatyard, but for publicity were often given their harbour trials in Limehouse Basin. They were tipped upside down and allowed to fill with water: if they self-righted, spontaneously ejecting the water, they passed. Reportedly these boats saved upwards of 12,000 lives.

===In national politics===
On 1 January 1948 the Regent&#x27;s Canal was nationalised. On 27 May 1948 eleven dockers were ordered to load bags of a chemical onto a ship docked in Limehouse Basin. Because the chemical stained their skin and clothing they felt it was a dangerous cargo and refused to handle it, unless for extra payment of their own specifying. This was a direct challenge to the National Dock Labour Scheme instituted by the newly elected Labour government, which had replaced the old system of casual employment by a legal right to minimum work, holidays, sick pay and pensions, but under a regime where dockers had to obey orders or face disciplinary action (although they could appeal). The dispute escalated to a London-wide dock strike, spreading to Liverpool, whereupon the Attlee government invoked emergency powers and ordered troops to unload food vessels.

==Swing bridge==
The swing bridge that carries Narrow Street over the Thames lock is a 1961 replacement. Built on Teesside, to get it to London it was made into a seaworthy pontoon and towed down the North Sea.

==Redevelopment==


===Derelict===
Burning coal in London was made illegal. The last commercial barge traffic in Limehouse Basin was in April 1968. It closed as a transshipment dock in 1969, though it continued to be visited by ships with scrap metal for Cohens as late as 1980. It became a bleak, derelict industrial zone. Planners wanted to fill it in &quot;because they said children would fall in and drown&quot;. Also, the area was blighted by traffic congestion, access to the Isle of Dogs being poor. The Greater London Council proposed to demolish part of the railway viaduct and replace it by a 4-lane dual carriageway; an alternative route was between the Thames and the Basin, which would have cut through the exit lock.

===Controversy===
The redevelopment of the Basin for housing started in 1981 when the British Waterways Board organised an architectural competition. The winner was a £70 million scheme by the controversial architects Richard Seifert and Partners. It called for half of the Basin to be filled in to provide 100,000 square feet of offices and 400 luxury houses. It was strongly opposed by local residents, including David Owen, and was refused by the planning inspector who, however, was overruled by the Secretary of State. The architectural controversy attracted Prince Charles, who made a surprise visit to the Basin. The scheme was never fulfilled, except for Goodhart Place. Instead, the Basin was developed in phases, as and when the financial climate permitted.

===Under the Basin: Limehouse Link===
The answer to traffic congestion, said the London Docklands Development Corporation, was to run the Limehouse Link tunnel under the northern arc of the Basin. No precedent existed for such a large scale underground structure in those conditions. Since it was close to the DLR, precautions were needed to stop ground movements from collapsing the 150-year old brick viaduct.

The top ground was first consolidated by removing silt with a floating dredger and replacing it with North Sea aggregate to reclaim a stretch of dry land. The tunnel was made by the cut and cover, bottom up method. The trench was excavated inside a temporary cofferdam formed by massive piles braced by steel struts. The piles were very difficult to drive in the over-consolidated London Clay — and afterwards to remove. The first test pile was driven by Margaret Thatcher on 20 November 1989. Further precautions were taken to weight the base slab — if the groundwater pressure is high enough, even a concrete tunnel will float — and also not to form a new hydraulic connection between the Basin and the aquifer in the lowest stratum of the Woolwich and Reading Beds. The Regent&#x27;s Canal was closed off for a year.

The four Marina Heights buildings were afterwards built over the tunnel. Wet basin area was restored in some other places e.g. the canal mouths by removing the marine aggregate.

===New lock===
The old mid-Victorian shiplock was large and used a lot of water, so in 1988-9 the Thames lock was rebuilt to much smaller dimensions. The new lock is only 24 feet (7.3 metres) wide — even less than the 1820 original — and the depth over the sills is 10 feet. It was rebuilt within the confines of the 1869 ship lock, whose outline can still be seen.

==Amenities==
Facilities alongside the Basin include a Gordon Ramsay gastropub, a tai chi academy, a gym, a kayak hire, a fine arts bronze foundry and gallery, and a cosmetic dental practice. Immediately near is the historic pub The Grapes, an Italian restaurant, a hair studio and a dry cleaner. In Ropemaker&#x27;s Fields (a small park immediately to the east) there is a children&#x27;s playground and a tennis court. Limehouse DLR station is beside the northwestern corner of the Basin. St Anne&#x27;s Limehouse (1730), a Grade-1 listed building by Nicholas Hawksmoor, is a familiar landmark.

The canals offer recreation for narrowboats and kayaks; their towpaths, for walkers and cyclists. A six-mile round trip is: up the Limehouse Cut to join the Lee Navigation, then west by Duckett&#x27;s Canal to join the Regent&#x27;s Canal, then south back to Limehouse Basin.

Housing immediately alongside the Basin includes Goodhart Place, the apartment blocks Medland House, Berglen Court, Pinnacle 1 (awarded Best Apartment Building 2001), Marina Heights (four), Pinnacle 2, two terraced town houses and Victory Place. The Basin (excluding its buildings) is part of the Narrow Street Conservation Area. Canary Wharf is within walking distance; the scenic river route is across Narrow Street and using the bridge over Limekiln Dock. It can also be accessed by the 135 and D3 buses, or by the DLR.

==Marina==

The Cruising Association has a purpose-built headquarters at Limehouse Basin, where a number of vessels, both sea-going and narrowboat type, are permanently moored. There are facilities appropriate to a marina, such as secure jetties, diesel supply, laundry, shower, chemical toilet disposal, a pump-out and a chandlery.

&quot;According to several boating associations&quot;, 

Of the berths, 75 are for permanent waterside living; others are for leisure use, wintering vessels, or visitors. The Thames lock operates 2 hours either side of low water.

At the Marina Office a plaque commemorates Stephen Maynard, a fireman who lost his life on 25 January 1980 putting out a ship fire in the dock: he was 26. In 2016 colleagues were still holding an annual minute&#x27;s silence in his memory.

===How deep is Limehouse Basin?===
The depth of the Basin is variable. When it used to be a working dock it was supposed to be at least 6 metres deep and regularly dredged to keep to that standard; but this is no longer so. The Limehouse Link tunnel was made deep enough to give a minimum draft of 3 metres for canal barges. At the Thames entrance lock the depth over the sills is also 3 metres.

==Wildlife==

According to the Canal &amp; River Trust 

Birds that live there or are regular visitors include coots, moorhen, geese, black headed gulls, ducks (including red-crested pochards), cormorants, common tern, grey heron, and the occasional kingfisher. There is usually a pair of nesting mute swans.

Fish include bream, roach, pike and occasional eels.

In some hot seasons a &quot;green carpet&quot; descends from the canals and can cover much of the Basin. This is not &quot;algae&quot;, but duckweed. While it can be a nuisance on canals, it is harmless to humans and is an important high-protein food source for waterfowl.

==In literature and broadcasting==
&quot;Maidens&#x27; Trip&quot; (1948) by Emma Smith describes the wartime experiences of three &quot;dainty young girls&quot; who, as part of their national service, volunteered to load and navigate barges from Limehouse Basin to Birmingham and back — with only a bucket for a lavatory. Recalled Smith: (Although no V1 flying bombs did drop into Limehouse Basin, three exploded within yards of it.)

The real canal boatmen travelled with their families, their wives giving birth on board; the babies (wrote Smith) were &quot;little creatures who would pass their early days chained for safety to the chimney-pots&quot;.

The book was adapted for radio (1968) and television (1977).

==Archaeology==
Archaeologists had an opportunity to look underground when Limehouse Basin was redeveloped. Beside the Thames lock, at Victoria Wharf, a team found the remains of an earlier dock, whose timbers they dated to 1584-5 by dendrochronology. There was evidence of shipbuilding around the time of the Spanish Armada. Coins and other finds came from as far afield as Cuba, Persia, and China.

While excavating the Basin for the Limehouse Link a 16th-century cannon was found.

Another team excavated a site on the other side of the lock. Finds showed the 16th and 17th century occupants were exceptionally wealthy men and women. &quot;Meals were likely to be served on fine Mediterranean tableware and wine taken in glasses derived from the finest production centres of the age&quot;. The archaeologists realised it had been inhabited by retired pirates of the Caribbean, some of whom they were able to identify by name.

<text>Victoria Park (known colloquially as Vicky Park or the People&#x27;s Park) is a park in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in East London, England.

It is the largest park in Tower Hamlets and one of London&#x27;s most visited green spaces with approximately 9 million visitors every year. The park spans of open space and opened to the public in 1845.

==Park==

===Facilities=== 
There are two cafes in the park, The Pavilion Cafe in the west and The Hub in the east. There are two playgrounds, one on either side of the park, as well as sporting facilities and a skatepark in the east. The park is home to many historic artifacts and features and has decorative gardens and wilder natural areas as well as open grass lands. It also hosts a lawn bowls club.

Victoria Park is used as a concert venue and hosts many festivals each year. The park is approximately a mile away from the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Owing to its proximity to the Olympic park, it became a venue for the BT London Live event along with Hyde Park during the London 2012 Olympic Games.

The park underwent a £12 million refurbishment in 2011 and 2012, and many of the park&#x27;s old features have been reinstated or repaired. It has won the Green Flag People&#x27;s Choice Award for the most popular public green space in 2012, 2014 and 2015, the only park in the UK to have won the award three times.

The park is Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

===History===
==== Origins ====
A mass petition to the Queen, in support of a recommendation by epidemiologist William Farr, led to the creation of the park. The UK Parliament passed the York House and Victoria Park Act 1841, which enabled the Crown Estate to purchases which were laid out by notable London planner and architect Sir James Pennethorne between 1842 and 1846. A part of the area was known as Bonner Fields, after Bishop Bonner, the last lord of the manor of Stepney. Bonner&#x27;s Hall, also known as Bonner&#x27;s Palace, served as a residence of the Bishops of London, and was pulled down in 1845 to make way for Victoria Park. The land had originally been parkland, associated with the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, but by the mid-1800s had been spoiled by the extraction of gravel, and clay for bricks.

The park was opened to the public in 1845. It is reminiscent of Regent&#x27;s Park, having been designed by Pennethorne&#x27;s teacher John Nash, and is considered by some as the finest park in the East End. It is bounded on two sides by canals: the Regent&#x27;s Canal lies to the west, while its branch, once known as the Hertford Union Canal, runs along the southern edge of the park. There is a gate named after Edmund Bonner, and guarding the main entrance at Sewardstone Road are replica statues of the Dogs of Alcibiades, the originals of which stood here from 1912 to 2009 until vandalism led to their being removed, restored and rehoused elsewhere in the park.
Two pedestrian alcoves are located at the east end of the park near the Hackney Wick war memorial where they were placed in 1860. They are surviving fragments of the old London Bridge, demolished in 1831, and were part of the 1760 refurbishment of the 600-year-old bridge, by Sir Robert Taylor and George Dance the Younger. They provided protection for pedestrians on the narrow carriageway. The insignia of Bridge House Estates can be seen inside these alcoves, which have been Grade II listed since 1951.

The Lido opened in 1936 and reopened in 1952 following damage during the Second World War; it was closed in 1986 and demolished in 1990.

====The People&#x27;s Park====

In the latter half of the 19th Century, Victoria Park became an essential amenity for the working classes of the East End. For some East End children in the 1880s, this may have been the only large stretch of uninterrupted greenery they ever encountered. Facilities like the Bathing Pond (picture right) —later superseded by the park lido—would have introduced many to swimming in an era when many public baths (like that at Shacklewell) were still simply communal washing facilities.

Victoria Park&#x27;s reputation as the &#x27;People&#x27;s Park&#x27; grew as it became a centre for political meetings and rallies, perhaps exceeding in importance than the more well-known Hyde Park in this regard. The park occupies much of the space between Tower Hamlets — experiencing poverty in the 19th century and with a tradition of socialist and revolutionary agitation — and Hackney, more genteel, but heir to a legacy of religious dissent and non-conformism that led to its own brand of reformism. So there was a lot of activity at Speaker&#x27;s Corners.

Although any one could set up their own soapbox, the biggest crowds were usually drawn to &#x27;star&#x27; socialist speakers such as William Morris and Annie Besant.
This description by J. H. Rosney, correspondent for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (February 1888) evokes a scene:

The tradition of public speaking in the park continued until well after the Second World War, and was still later reflected in politically oriented rock concerts, such as those held by Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League in the 1970s and 1980s. And it is still not uncommon for marches or demonstrations to begin or end in Victoria Park.

On 26 June 2014, a campaign to revive the Speakers&#x27; Corner at Victoria Park was launched at a democratic theatre event held in Shoreditch Town Hall. Hosted by The People Speak, a participatory campaign and events group, 66 audience members deliberated over how to use the pooled cash revenue from their tickets, and eventually voted to recreate the well-known tradition of free speech and debate in Hyde Park in East London&#x27;s Victoria Park. The campaign was to formally launch in July 2014.

==== Second World War ====

During the Second World War, Victoria Park was largely closed to the public and effectively became one huge Ack-Ack (anti-aircraft) site. The gun emplacements conveniently straddled the path of German Luftwaffe bombers looping north west after attacking the docks and warehouses further south in what is now Tower Hamlets, and so the park was of some strategic importance.

Prisoner of war camps were erected along the north eastern edge parallel to Victoria Park Road and were used to house both Germans and Italians. An air raid shelter was built underground just inside St Marks Gate. On 15 October 1940 a bomb made a direct hit, trapping around a hundred inside and killing fifteen. Much of the park was taken to be used as part of the war effort, which much of the earth being used for allotments, military stations and barrage balloon sites, even the park railings were melted down to be re-used.

More controversially, anti-aircraft activity in the park has been implicated in the crowd panic that caused the Bethnal Green tube disaster of 1943. Some eyewitness accounts have led to the suggestion that, after several air raid alerts, the panic run for shelter was caused by a gigantic explosion of noise from the direction of the park. A BBC documentary on the event suggests that this was due to the first firing of the new Z-Battery anti-aircraft rockets. The UK Ministry of Defence, however, disputes this account.

The war destroyed many of the park&#x27;s beautiful early features: three lodges including the Bonner Lodge were completely reduced to rubble, the palm house was shattered, St Augustine&#x27;s Church collapsed in on itself and the pagoda, moorish shelter and lido were all damaged. With finances tight after the war ended, most were torn down rather than repaired.

==== Modern ====

In 1986 the Greater London Council transferred responsibility for Victoria Park to London Borough of Tower Hamlets and Hackney, through a joint management board, was part of both boroughs. Since 1994 Tower Hamlets has run the park alone.

In recent times, Victoria Park became noted for its open-air music festivals, often linked with a political cause. In 1978, Rock Against Racism organised a protest event against growth of far-right organisations such as the National Front. The concert was played by The Clash, Steel Pulse, X-Ray Spex, The Ruts, Sham 69, Generation X, and the Tom Robinson Band. The 1980 rock docudrama &quot;Rude Boy&quot; features The Clash playing at an Anti-Nazi League event in the park. London International Festival of Theatre presented pyrotechnics company Group F in 2001 and again in 2004, led by acclaimed pyrotechnician Christophe Berthonneau. In 2006 through to 2010, Paradise Gardens, a free community festival, produced by Remarkable Productions working in partnership with Tower Hamlets Council&#x27;s Arts and Events department, re-imagined Victorian pleasure gardens for the modern era, before moving in 2012 to London Pleasure Gardens in Newham. Radiohead played two concerts in the park on 24–25 June 2008. Madness celebrated their 30th year with a fifth Madstock festival there on 17 July 2009. The park has also become very popular amongst dance music&#x27;s biggest names; Dutch DJ Tiësto played at Victoria Park in 2009 and again in 2010.
On 24–25 July 2010, Victoria Park was the site of the first High Voltage Festival. Victoria Park has also hosted Field Day, The Apple Cart, Underage Festival, Lovebox Festival, and All Points East.

For children, Victoria Park is host to: a &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Club&quot; for under-fives and a programme of summer activities and a children&#x27;s play park including a paddling pool that runs from 1-5pm in the summer months.

The oldest model boat club in the world, the Victoria Model Steam Boat Club, founded in the Park on 15 July 1904, is still active today and holds up to 17 of their Sunday regattas a year. The VMSB Club runs straight-running boats just as they did 100 years ago but have also progressed to radio controlled boats and hydroplanes. The first Regatta is traditionally held on Easter Sunday and the Steam Regatta is always held on the first Sunday in July.

The Park is also the home of Tower Hamlets Football Club and Victoria Park United Football club, Tower Hamlets Cricket Club, Victoria Park Harriers &amp; Tower Hamlets Athletics Club, which has its headquarters at St. Augustine&#x27;s Hall located at the north-east corner of the Park. The club celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2006.

During the summer cricket is played every evening on the park&#x27;s three all-weather wickets, organised by the Victoria Park Community Cricket League. The park also has a popular three-lane cricket net, free to use at all times. It was refurbished to a high standard at the end of 2005, paid for by a grant from the England and Wales Cricket Board.

The park is open daily from 7:00am to dusk.

In 2010 the National Lottery Big Lottery Fund awarded the London Borough of Tower Hamlets a £4.5 million grant towards a £12 million programme of major improvements to Victoria Park. Plans included a new building, the Eastern Hub, comprising a cafe, public toilets, community rooms and adult play facilities to promote healthy living.

The landscape has been restored in many places, and the Old English gardens restored to include new water features. In 1842 a pagoda was put in London&#x27;s Hyde Park as an entrance to its Chinese Exhibition, and when the exhibition finished it was moved to Victoria Park&#x27;s island in the west boating lake for ornamental purposes. The original architect for the park, Pennethorne, designed a bridge to the island that matched the style of the pagoda; this was never built, however, and during WW2 the pagoda suffered much damage.

The pagoda was eventually demolished in the 1950s and all but forgotten, while the water surrounding the island was filled in, shrinking the lake and making what was the island part of the park landscape. With the park&#x27;s refurbishments that began in 2010 it was decided to restore the island to its former glory; the lake was extended back around the original area, the pagoda was replicated through the use of many photographs and eye-witness information and then, to complete Pennethorne&#x27;s unfinished vision, the plans for his original bridge were discovered and the bridge built after over 100 years. As a finishing touch, pedalos and row boats were brought back on to the West lake, a feature which had been missing from the park for decades.

The Burdett-Coutts fountain (named after the Victorian philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts) had a partial restoration of its intricate granite carvings and sculptures. In recent years the fountain had been fenced off due to graffiti and vandalism, but along with the restoration the fences were removed, and four symmetrical mirror pools were placed around the fountain along with decorative flower beds. The area is now a public space, with many benches offering an attractive place to sit.

A modern addition to the park is the Memoryscape trail, an audio trail winding through the park that visitors listen to using headphones. The trail consists of many historical facts and tidbits of information, and includes accounts from people who grew up in and around the park, with one person for example reminiscing about the prisoner of war camp in the park during World War 2. Visitors can either download the tracks from the council&#x27;s website and put them on their own device, or they can get a pair of pre-loaded headphones from the hub in exchange for a small refundable deposit.

As part of the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Romanian Cultural Institute commissioned artist Ernö Bartha to produce two sculptures &quot;Bird&quot; and &quot;Skyscraper&quot; in the West Lake. Despite both being made of hay enforced with steel frames they still remain in the park and have become a prominent feature of the lake receiving their own plaques in 2015.

==Transport==
London Buses Routes 277, 425 serve the heart of the park, 8, 339, D6, and Night Route N8 on Roman Road. 309 and D3 at London Chest Hospital via Approach Road. 388 (westbound) on Victoria Park Road.

Mile End tube station for the Central line, District line, Hammersmith &amp; City line services to Stratford, Upminster, Barking or Central London is 10min via Grove Road, you can take the 277 or 425 to Mile End which is 5min away. Cambridge Heath station for National Rail services to Liverpool Street and Enfield or Chingford is 5mins away via Bishops Way. Victoria Park had its own rather grand station Victoria Park railway station (London), on the North London Railway, closed in 1943. The station survived into the 1960s, but when the line to Stratford reopened, it was replaced by Hackney Wick railway station, which is also a short walk from the eastern end of the Park.

The Regent&#x27;s Canal borders the west side of the park, while Hertford Union Canal borders the south side of the park; this offers access to walking or cycling on their towpaths. The National Cycle Route 1 (NCR1) passes here on the Hertford Union Canal. Mare Street or Mile End or Hackney Wick can easily be reached from here.

The northern end of the Greenway walk/cycle path to Beckton, via Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and Newham General Hospital, starts nearby on the eastern side of Victoria Park.

== Awards ==

In summer 2008, the park was voted London&#x27;s best local park by &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine.

In 2011 it won its first Green Flag award (which it has won every year since,) and it was again voted London&#x27;s favourite park, this time in the national People&#x27;s Choice Award, a UK wide competition. In 2013 Victoria Park was also certified a Green Heritage Site by English Heritage and Keep Britain Tidy, an award given in recognition of achieving the required standard in the management and interpretation of a site with local or national historic importance.

In 2013 the park came second in a national vote to find the public&#x27;s favourite Green Flag Awarded park, beaten only by Margam Country Park in south Wales from a field of 1,448 qualifying open spaces.

In 2014 Victoria Park reinstated itself as the most popular park in the UK, with over 13,000 votes in the Green Flag Peoples Choice Awards. The park also was once again rewarded both Green Flag and Green Heritage status.

In August 2015 it was revealed that the park had retained its Green Flag People&#x27;s Choice Award, winning the most votes for a park in the whole of the UK.

<text>Ralph Straus Regula (December 3, 1924 – July 19, 2017) was an American politician from Ohio. A member of the Republican Party, he served in the Ohio House of Representatives, the Ohio State Senate and the United States House of Representatives. He represented Ohio&#x27;s 16th congressional district for 18 terms from 1973 to 2009. In the 110th Congress (2007–2009), he was the second longest serving Republican member of the House of Representatives (after Bill Young of Florida).

==Early life==
Regula was born in Beach City, Ohio on December 3, 1924. He served in the United States Navy during World War II. After his service, he attended Mount Union College using his GI Bill. He met his wife, the former Mary Rogusky, while at Mount Union. After graduating in 1948, he became a schoolteacher while studying at the William McKinley College of Law in Canton. He was an Episcopalian.

==Career==
He was elected to the Ohio Board of Education and served on that body from 1960 to 1964. He was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1964 and served one term before winning a seat in the State Senate.

In 1972, President Richard Nixon nominated longtime 16th district Congressman Frank T. Bow as the United States Ambassador to Panama, which opened the door for Regula to run for the seat. Regula went on to win 18 terms in Congress.

Regula was ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health, Human Services and Education funding in the 110th Congress. The subcommittee&#x27;s budget, the largest discretionary domestic account, was over $140 billion. Regula, a former teacher and principal, was a Congressional leader in pushing for alternative solutions in improving reading skills, developing teacher training and increasing Pell Grant funding so that poorer and middle class students can obtain two and four year degrees. He increased by millions of dollars the amount of federal money committed to research in fighting cancer, heart disease and birth defects. Regula was a member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership and supported stem cell research.

Regula was also a Congressional leader in alternative energy sources. He was an early champion of fuel cell technology and he has directed federal funding back to his home state, Ohio, which is recognized as a national leader in fuel cell research and development.

Beginning in 1975, Regula blocked the renaming of Mount McKinley in Alaska, named for President William McKinley, to Denali. This was, in part, because Canton, McKinley&#x27;s long-time hometown and resting place, fell within the boundaries of Regula&#x27;s congressional district. The name was eventually changed in 2015. Regula described the change as a &quot;political stunt&quot; by President Obama and called it &quot;ridiculous&quot; while also calling the President &quot;a dictator.&quot;

With his seat on the appropriations committee, he was able to use federal funds to establish and protect parks and trails in his district. He earmarked $200 million for the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, now the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. In 2003, the Stark County Park District voted to rename the 25 miles of the Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath Trail within Stark County the &quot;Congressman Ralph Regula Towpath Trail&quot;. It was announced at the dedication of a 150-foot-long tunnel section of the trail paid by a federal grant Regula arranged. &quot;You really did catch me by surprise,&quot; Regula said. The park district honored Regula for his continued support in Congress for the Ohio &amp; Erie National Heritage Canalway.

His wife Mary helped create the First Ladies National Historic Site. After she initially raised funds to seed the museum&#x27;s collection, Ralph appropriated $1.2 million to pushed development further.

Regula retired from the House of Representatives when his term ended in January 2009. He was succeeded by John Boccieri, a Democrat from the Ohio General Assembly. After retiring from Congress, Regula joined Dawson &amp; Associates in Washington, D.C. as an advisor on federal budget and permitting matters.

<text>The dark chanting goshawk (Melierax metabates) is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae which is found across much of sub-Saharan Africa and southern Arabia, with an isolated and declining population in southern Morocco.

==Description==
The dark chanting goshawk is a medium-sized, bulky hawk with an upright stance. The head, breast and upperparts are essentially dark grey, while the underparts, other than the breast, are white, finely barred with black. The wing primaries are black, and the tail has broad black and white bars. The cere and the long legs are orange-red. The female is, on average, larger than the male, weighing up to 840g to the male&#x27;s maximum weight of 700g. Juveniles tend to have browner plumage reminiscent in colour and pattern to a buzzard &quot;Buteo spp&quot; but with the broad winged, long tailed silhouette of an accipiter. 
===Voice===
As its common name suggests, the dark chanting goshawk is a vocal bird, although less so than its two congeners. It often calls from a perch or in flight, making an accelerating series of piping notes and fluty whistles, which has been described as a song or chant and there are up to a dozen notes in a series &#x27;. It also gives a high-pitched &#x27;. During the breeding season it is more vocal than when non breeding.

==Distribution and subspecies==
The dark chanting goshawk breeds in sub-Saharan Africa, but avoids the rainforests of the Congo Basin and the far south, where it is replaced by the pale chanting goshawk and east Africa where the eastern chanting goshawk seems to replace it.

There are five currently recognised subspecies,

*&quot;Melierax metabates metabates&quot;: Senegal and the Gambia east to Ethiopia, south to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and northern Tanzania.
*&quot;Melierax metabates neumanni&quot;: Mali east to northern Sudan.
*&quot;Melierax metabates theresae&quot;: south west Morocco.
*&quot;Melierax metabates ignoscens&quot;: South western Arabia, i.e. south western Saudi Arabia and western Yemen.
*&quot;Melierax metabates mechowi&quot;: south eastern Gabon to Angola, south Tanzania south to northern Namibia and north eastern South Africa.

Although the status of M. neumanni is debatable as it is poorly differentiated.

==Habitat==
The dark chanting goshawk occurs in savannahs and open woodlands, favouring mixed bushveld and broad-leafed woodlands and avoid dense forest and desert, where it overlaps with other &quot;Melierax&quot; species the dark chanting goshawk prefers moister richer woodland. In southern Africa it is found in tall, well-developed woodland, especially where miombo (&quot;Brachystegia spp&quot;), mopane (&quot;Colosphermum mopane&quot;), Zambezi teak (&quot;Baikiaea plurijuga&quot;), Knob thorn (&quot;Senegalia nigrescens&quot;) and Marula (&quot;Sclerocarya birrea&quot;) are among the canopy.

==Habits==
The dark chanting goshawk preys on a wide variety of animals, especially mammals, birds and reptiles; these are normally hunted from a perch, from which the bird swoops to capture prey on the ground or in the air. They have been recorded following honey badgers (&quot;Mellivora capensis&quot;), Southern ground-hornbills, dogs or people, catching the small animals disturbed by their passage. The largest recorded prey items are helmeted guineafowl &quot;Numida meleagris&quot; and dwarf mongoose.

The dark chanting goshawk is a territorial nester. The courtship display is performed by both sexes during which the male repeatedly dives at the female, who presents her claws to him. The nest is constructed in a tree by both sexes and is a flattish platform of sticks, slightly lower in the centre than at the edges and decorated with spider webs and sometimes cemented with mud. It may be lined with a wide variety of materials, including animal, plant, mineral and man-made objects. The one to two, occasionally three, eggs are laid from July–November, with a peak from August–October, and they are incubated by the female for around 36–38 days, while the male brings food to her at the nest. Initially, the young are brooded and guarded by the female, while the male hunts to provide all the food. The young fledge at about 50 days old, and are fully independent roughly 3–8 months after fledging. They move away from their natal area at the beginning of the following breeding season.

==Taxonomy==
The chanting goshawks are sometimes considered to be a single species, the chanting goshawk &quot;Melierax metabates&quot;, or to be this species plus the other two lumped as the pale chanting goshawk &quot;Melierax canorus&quot;.

==Conservation status==
The dark-chanting goshawk is widespread and common and therefore not globally threatened. However, the two isolated subspecies occurring in Morocco and the Arabian Peninsula, are highly vulnerable to the clearance of woodland. In particular the subspecies &quot;Melierax metabates theresae&quot;, is confined to a small area of south western Morocco, where it is thought to be nearly extinct as a result of deforestation and hunting. Otherwise its wide range means that Birdlife International categorise the species as Least Concern.

<text>HMAS &quot;Geranium (formerlyHMS &quot;Geranium) was an sloop built in Scotland and launched in 1915. The ship was operated by the Royal Navy as a minesweeper from 1915 until 1919, when she was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) for use as a survey ship between 1919 and 1927. The ship was decommissioned in 1927 and scrapped during 1932, with the remains scuttled in 1935.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Geranium&quot; was one of 56 &quot;Arabis&quot;-class sloops built for the Royal Navy during World War I. The sloops-of-war were intended for minesweeping duties in European waters.

&quot;Geranium&quot; had a displacement of 1,250 tons. She was in length overall, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . The propulsion system consisted of a four-cylinder triple expansion engine, connected to a single propeller shaft. Maximum speed was , and the ship could achieve a range of at . Up to 250 tons of coal could be carried.

&quot;Geranium&quot; was laid down for the Royal Navy by the Greenock &amp; Grangemouth Dockyard Company, Greenock, Scotland, in August 1915 and launched on 8 November 1915. She was delivered to the Royal Navy on 18 March 1916.

==Operational history==
&quot;Geranium&quot; joined the Mediterranean Fleet after commissioning, being based at Malta.

After World War I, &quot;Geranium&quot; and two sister ships ( and ) were sent to Australia to clear mines deployed by the German auxiliary cruiser . Despite hard work in rough seas, the ships only found one mine.

&quot;Geranium&quot; and the other two ships were transferred to the Royal Australian Navy on 18 October 1919. The ships&#x27; minesweeper design made them suitable for handling survey equipment, and &quot;Geranium&quot; entered RAN service as the navy&#x27;s first survey ship. The ship was poorly designed for survey duties in tropical Australian waters: she was designed for the North Sea climate, and was required to carry a ship&#x27;s company of 113, 36 more than the intended ship&#x27;s company of 77. In 1923, the sloop ran aground on an uncharted reef off Vanderlin Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The ship&#x27;s company were able to refloat the ship and patch the damage, and after repairs in Sydney, the ship resumed northern survey operations. In October, &quot;Geranium&quot; rescued the civilian steamship &quot;Montoro&quot; after she struck Young Reef.

In early 1924, the ship ran aground again in the MacArthur River. The ship was refloated and repaired. Later that year, &quot;Geranium&quot; was fitted to carry a Fairey IIID seaplane: the first RAN survey vessel to carry an aircraft. In May 1927, the survey ship assisted the steamship &quot;Tasman&quot;, which had hit a reef off Clarke Island.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Geranium&quot; paid off in 1927. The ship was broken up for scrap at Cockatoo Island Dockyard during 1932, and the stripped hulk was sunk as a target in the Tasman Sea outside Sydney Heads on 24 April 1935.

<text>The State Emblem of Pakistan was adopted in 1954 and symbolises the ideological foundation of the country, the basis of its economy, its cultural heritage and its guiding principles.

==Design==

The four components of the emblem are a crescent and star crest above an escutcheon, which is surrounded by a wreath, below which is a scroll. The crest and the green colour of the emblem are considered traditional symbols of Islam. The quartered shield in the centre shows cotton, wheat, tea and jute, which were the major crops of Pakistan at independence and are shown in a form of escutcheon and signify as the main agricultural base for the importance of the Nation&#x27;s economy. The floral wreath, surrounding the shield, is &quot;Jasminum officinale&quot; (the national flower) and represents the floral designs used in traditional Mughal art and emphasizes the cultural heritage of Pakistan. The scroll supporting the shield contains the national motto in Urdu, &quot;&quot;, which reads from right to left: (), translated as &quot;Faith, Unity, Discipline&quot; which are intended as the guiding principles for Pakistan. This logo was designed by Maraj Muhammad student of National College of Arts.

<text>Henri de Baillet-Latour, Count of Baillet-Latour (1 March 1876 – 6 January 1942) was a Belgian aristocrat and the third president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

== Early life ==
Henri de Baillet-Latour was born in Brussels, Belgium, on 1 March 1876. He was the oldest of three children. His father was Count Ferdinand de Baillet-Latour, former governor of the Province of Antwerp, and his mother was Countess Caroline d&#x27;Oultremont de Duras.

He studied law at the University of Louvain, Belgium, between 1895 and 1897. His marriage to Countess Elisabeth Clary-Aldringen took place on 14 July 1904. Their son Guy Siegfried Ferdinand was born in May 1905, and their daughter Sophie Thérèse Ghislain Marie was born in February 1908.

== Career ==
===Belgian Olympic Committee===
De Baillet-Latour was elected as a member of the IOC in 1903. He was tasked with the organisation of sport in Belgium, and he co-founded the Belgian Olympic Committee in 1906. He was responsible for coordinating Belgium&#x27;s participation at the London Olympics in 1908 and the Stockholm Olympics in 1912.

He was instrumental in securing the 1920 Summer Olympics for the Belgian city of Antwerp, and with only one year to prepare for the Games, he took on the responsibility of organizing the huge event amidst the devastation in Belgium following the First World War. The 1920 Games turned out to be a huge success despite the short notice, gaining him a great deal of respect among his IOC colleagues.

===International Olympic Committee===
When Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Movement, retired from the presidency in 1925 (becoming Honorary President), Henri de Baillet-Latour was elected as his successor. After the 1928 Olympics, he tried – but failed – to ban women from all sports in the Olympics.

He was re-elected for a second term as IOC President in June 1933 and held the office for 17 years until his death in 1942. As IOC President, he focused on preserving the traditional ideals and integrity of the Olympics, and supporting amateur sport globally during a time of increasing political and commercial pressures, despite his antipathy towards Jews, and his desire to exclude women from participating in the Olympics. He was determined and diplomatic.

Henri de Baillet-Latour wrote to Avery Brundage in 1933: &quot;I am not personally fond of jews and of the jewish influence, but I will not have them molested in no way whatsoever.&quot; Baillet-Latour opposed boycotting the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games.

After the 1936 Olympic Games, he became an honorary member of &quot;Freude und Arbeit&quot;, the Nazi sports organization led by German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. In 1938, his wife congratulated Hitler when he annexed the Sudetenland. 

In June 1939, the IOC voted unanimously in favour of Germany organising the 1940 Winter Games, replacing Japan that had returned the right to organise the 1940 Games. De Baillet-Latour argued that the decision in favour of Nazi Germany, which had occupied the Czech rump state three months before, showed the IOC&#x27;s independence of political influences.

In 1940, when Germany invaded Belgium, his wife thanked Hitler &quot;for bringing Nazi ideology to Belgium&quot;.

==Death==
He died of a heart attack on 6 January 1942 in Brussels. His funeral was attended by leading Nazis, and German soldiers stood guard over his coffin, on which lay a wreath with a swastika which had been sent by Hitler.

Four months before his death, his only son had died, aged 36, in a plane crash on the Isle of Arran, Scotland, while on active service with the Free Belgian forces.

Henri de Baillet-Latour was succeeded as IOC president by his vice-president Sigfrid Edström.

<text>Regent&#x27;s Canal is a canal across an area just north of central London, England. It provides a link from the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal, north-west of Paddington Basin in the west, to the Limehouse Basin and the River Thames in east London. The canal is long.

== History==

First proposed by Thomas Homer in 1802 as a link from the Paddington arm of the then Grand Junction Canal (opened in 1801) with the River Thames at Limehouse, the Regent&#x27;s Canal was built during the early 19th century after the (52 Geo. 3. c. cxcv) was passed. Noted architect and town planner John Nash was a director of the company; in 1811 he had produced a masterplan for George IV, then Prince Regent, to redevelop a large area of central north London – as a result, the Regent&#x27;s Canal was included in the scheme, running for part of its distance along the northern edge of Regent&#x27;s Park. 

As with many Nash projects, the detailed design was passed to one of his assistants, in this case James Morgan, who was appointed chief engineer of the canal company. Work began on 14 October 1812. The first section from Paddington to Camden Town opened in 1816 and included a long tunnel under Maida Hill east of an area now known as &#x27;Little Venice&#x27;, and a much shorter tunnel, just long, under Lisson Grove. The Camden to Limehouse section, including the long Islington Tunnel and the Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock (used to transfer cargo from seafaring vessels to canal barges – today known as Limehouse Basin), opened four years later on 1 August 1820. Various intermediate basins were also constructed (e.g.: Cumberland Basin to the east of Regent&#x27;s Park, Battlebridge Basin, close to Kings Cross, and City Road Basin). Many other basins such as Wenlock Basin, Kingsland Basin, St. Pancras Stone and Coal Basin, and one in front of the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s Granary were also built, and some of these survive.

All the locks were built with duplicate chambers to facilitate the heavy barge traffic. With the demise of commercial traffic in the early 1970s, at the end of 1973, the British Waterways Board embarked on a three-year programme to convert one chamber at each lock into an overflow weir to facilitate unmanned use by pleasure craft without the risk of serious flooding due to incorrect use of the paddles.

The City Road Basin, the nearest to the City of London, soon eclipsed the Paddington Basin in the amount of goods carried, principally coal and building materials. These were goods that were being shipped locally, in contrast to the canal&#x27;s original purpose of transshipping imports to the Midlands. The opening of the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838 actually increased the tonnage of coal carried by the canal. By the early twentieth century, with the Midland trade lost to the railways, and more deliveries made by road, the canal had fallen into a long decline.

===Explosion of the barge &quot;Tilbury&quot; under the Macclesfield Bridge===

Just before 5am on 2 October 1874 the narrowboat barge &quot;Tilbury&quot; which was loaded with sugar, nuts, three barrels of petroleum and around five tons of gunpowder exploded right under the Macclesfield Bridge, just outside London Zoo.
Until the explosion, the &quot;Tilbury&quot; was part of a convoy consisting of a tugboat and three narrowboats travelling westwards heading for a quarry in the West Midlands. 

====Damage and aftermath====
All the people on board died; captain Charles Baxton, a labourer named William Taylor, a third man and a young boy. The Macclesfield bridge was destroyed and rebuilt in 1876 reusing the cast iron pillars (made in Coalbrookdale according to an inscription at their top), but turning them by 180° (canal side towards tow path side) so tow rope grooves that were created before the incident can be seen on the outer side of the columns.

The explosion was heard 20 miles away. Debris flew in all directions, the roofs of surrounding houses blew off, windows smashed, trees uprooted and dead fish rained down on the West End. The tugboat&#x27;s keel was found embedded in a house 300 yards away. The bridge was nick-named the &#x27;Blow-Up Bridge&#x27;.

The damage would have been far worse had the barge exploded in the highly populated areas of Camden and Islington, which the convoy had passed through earlier that morning.

The canal company that owned &quot;Tilbury&quot; was condemned for gross negligence in permitting the “highly imprudent and improper” practice of carrying petroleum and gunpowder aboard the same barge.

The incident accelerated the passing of the Explosives Act 1875, which regulates the manufacture and carriage of dangerous substances.

===Railway projects===
There were a number of abortive projects to convert the route of the canal into a railway. In September 1845 a special general assembly of the proprietors approved the sale of the canal at the price of one million pounds to a group of businessmen who had formed the Regent&#x27;s Canal Railway Company for the purpose. The advertisement for the company explained: The vast importance of this undertaking, whereby a junction will be effected between all existing and projected railways north of the Thames, combined with the advantage of a General City Terminus, is too obvious to require comment.
By the proposed railway, passengers and goods will be brought into the heart of the City at a great saving of time and expense, and facilities will be afforded for the more expeditious transmission of the mails to most parts of the kingdom. 

The railway company subsequently failed, but in 1846 the directors of the canal went about trying to obtain an act of Parliament to allow them to build a railway along its banks. The scheme was abandoned in the face of vigorous opposition, especially from the government who objected to the idea of a railway passing through Regent&#x27;s Park. In 1859, two further schemes to convert the canal into a railway were proposed. One, from a company called the Central London Railway and Dock Company, was accepted by the directors, but once again the railway company failed. In 1860 the Regent&#x27;s Canal Company proposed a railway track alongside the canal from Kings Cross to Limehouse, but funds could not be raised. Further schemes over the next twenty years also came to nothing, with the Metropolitan Railway that opened to the south in 1863 serving much the same purpose of linking the lines radiating north of London.
In 1883, after some years of negotiation, the canal was sold to a company called the Regent&#x27;s Canal and City Docks Railway Company at a cost of £1,170,585. The company altered its name to the North Metropolitan Railway and Canal Company by the (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. clxxxviii), but no railway was ever built; instead it raised money for dock and canal improvement and eventually, in 1904, became the Regent&#x27;s Canal and Dock Company.

The Regent&#x27;s Canal and Dock Company became part of the merged Grand Union Canal Company on 1 January 1929.

===New uses===

A new purpose was found for the canal route in 1979, when the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) installed underground cables in a trough below the towpath between St John&#x27;s Wood and City Road. These 400 kV cables now form part of the National Grid, supplying electrical power to London. Pumped canal water is circulated as a coolant for the high-voltage cables. The canal is frequently used today for pleasure cruising; a regular waterbus service operates between Maida Vale and Camden, running hourly during the summer months.

Due to the increase in cycle commuting since the 2005 London Bombings and increasing environmental awareness, the canal&#x27;s towpath has become a busy cycle route for commuters. National Cycle Route 1 includes the stretch along the canal towpath from Limehouse Basin to Mile End. British Waterways carried out several studies into the effects of sharing the towpath between cyclists and pedestrians, all of which have concluded that despite the limited width there were relatively few problems at the time of the audits. More recently, in 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported on instances of conflict between pedestrians and cyclists.

== Geography ==

The Regent&#x27;s Canal forms a junction with the old Grand Junction Canal at Little Venice, a short distance north of Paddington Basin. After passing through the Maida Hill and Lisson Grove tunnels, the canal curves round the northern edge of Regent&#x27;s Park, passing London Zoo and skirting round the base of Primrose Hill. It continues through Camden Town and King&#x27;s Cross Central. It performs a sharp bend at Camley Street Natural Park, following Goods Way where it flows behind both St Pancras railway station and King&#x27;s Cross railway station. The canal opens out into Battlebridge Basin originally known as Horsfall Basin, home of the London Canal Museum. Continuing eastwards beyond the Islington tunnel it forms the southern end of Broadway Market and meets the Hertford Union Canal at Victoria Park, East London. It turns south towards the Limehouse Basin, where it meets the Limehouse Cut, and ends as it joins the River Thames. 

==Maximum craft dimensions==
On the Regent&#x27;s Canal the maximum length is , with a beam of and a headroom of . The navigational depth is, on average 1.15 m (3 ft 6 in).

==Culture==
In 2012, playwright Rob Inglis was awarded a £16,000 Arts Council grant to write &quot;Regent&#x27;s Canal, a Folk Opera&quot;, a musical that celebrates the 200th anniversary of the digging of the canal. It played in a number of locations around London in 2012.

<text>Paddington Basin is the name given to a long canal basin, and its surrounding area, in Paddington, London.

The basin commences 500 m south of the junction known as Little Venice, of the Regent&#x27;s Canal and the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal and runs for a similar length east–west. It was opened in 1801, with Paddington being chosen as the site of the basin because of its position on the New Road which led to the east, providing for onward transport. In its heyday, the basin was a major transshipment facility, and a hive of activity.

Since 2000, the basin has been the centre of a major redevelopment as part of the wider Paddington Waterside scheme and is surrounded by modern buildings.

==Redevelopment==

The contractors of a developers&#x27; consortium in partnership with the Canal and River Trust (and its predecessor British Waterways) in 2000 drained, cleaned and repaired the basin. In the latter half of the 20th century the basin attracted small and medium-sized commercial offices and is in part lined by specialist and private healthcare wings of St Mary&#x27;s Hospital. The basin has become home to a wide range of companies, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, the head office of which moved from Baker Street in 2004.

Most of the land north of the canal basin forms the 2010s development Merchant Square, North Wharf Road. Its main developer European Land and Property is a joint venture of Simon and David Reuben (the Reuben brothers) and the Jarvis family. In all, the development around Paddington Basin is creating of offices, homes, shops and leisure facilities. Its western buildings are mainly complete and occupied . 
;Completed buildings
*Paddington Walk is a block of 232 flats designed by Munkenbeck &amp; Marshall that completed in August 2005.
*The Point (224,000 sq ft) and Waterside (240,000 sq ft) are office blocks designed by Terry Farrell and Partners and the Richard Rogers Partnership respectively.

The original plan for the eastern end envisaged a commercial development focused around the Grand Union Basin and included the Winding building and the Grand Union building. The Richard Rogers Partnership originally designed the latter as three towers of 24, 32 and 40 floors rising to 164m, but the planners imposed a height limit of . The revised scheme comprised six linked blocks of 30 storeys totalling of mixed-use space, but the project was discarded when it looked like the site would be needed by the Health Campus (see below).

The Health Campus scheme collapsed in 2005 and in February 2006 the Paddington Development Corporation – which became European Land and Property Ltd – submitted a new planning application. Branded as Merchant Square, this proposed of mixed-use space spanning six buildings, including 554 residential units and 58% commercial space. Planning permission was granted on 1 March 2007. A revised planning application was subsequently submitted and was approved on 19 May 2011. 4 Merchant Square, a 16-storey block of 196 flats, designed by Tryfon Kalyvides Partnership, completed in 2013; 5 Merchant Square (formerly Carmine) is a 14-storey office block of designed by Mossessian and Partners which became fully let by 2015. Part of the building is occupied by Marks &amp; Spencer, which also occupies the Waterside Building.

In late 2021, Premier Inn constructed their largest, non-airport, hotel in Greater London on the north bank of the basin. The development was completed in March 2022.

3 Merchant Square, a 21-storey development of 159 luxury apartments and 42 standard apartments, was completed in summer 2014. 1 Merchant Square will be a residential tower of 42 storeys designed by Robin Partington Architects, which will be the tallest building in the City of Westminster, containing just over 200 residential units, a 90-room boutique hotel and a sky bar. 2 Merchant Square will be a 16-storey office building providing of Grade A space with of retail space. 6 Merchant Square will offer 119 apartments over 15 floors.

Merchant Square surrounds a central square. A life-size sculpture in memory of Sir Simon Milton was unveiled in September 2014 by Eric Pickles MP, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. The sculpture, designed by Bruce Denny, follows Sir Simon&#x27;s pivotal role in facilitating the regeneration of Paddington Basin.

===Pedestrian bridges===
The basin has creatively designed pedestrian bridges:
*The Rolling Bridge 
*The Fan Bridge

The Fan Bridge opened in autumn 2014 and moves with the motion of a Japanese hand fan.

==Transport==
The nearest London Underground stations are Edgware Road and Paddington, the latter also being served by National Rail.

<text>Carsington Water is a reservoir, operated by Severn Trent Water, between Wirksworth and Kniveton in Derbyshire, England. The reservoir takes water from the River Derwent at Ambergate during winter months, pumping up to the reservoir by long tunnels and aqueduct. Water is released back into the river during summer months for water abstraction and treatment further downstream. It is England&#x27;s ninth-largest reservoir with a capacity of 36,331 megalitres.

Planning for the reservoir started in the 1960s and construction started in 1979. In 1984, there was a partial collapse of the dam before it was filled. The dam was removed before the construction of a new dam began in 1989. The finished reservoir was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1992.

The reservoir is a major centre for leisure activities including walking, cycling, fly fishing, birdwatching, sailing, canoeing, and windsurfing. The land surrounding the reservoir, in particular the facilities around the visitor centre, has hosted events including a music festival, the Festival of the Peak.

==Facilities==

There are 3 main buildings on the Reservoir, which serve the public in a few different ways.

The Visitor Centre is the largest building, with a café featuring panoramic views. There is a small retail outlet currently leased by the RSPB and an outdoor equipment store.
Carsington Sports and Leisure is a place for the public to rent equipment, primarily bikes. The company also rents kayaks, canoes, small rowing boats, 
sailing boats, and windsurfing equipment. The company has a good stock of new windsurf hire equipment, with 3 quality starboard boards and sails from 3.5 to 7.5, with beginner kit also.
Carsington Sailing Club owns an extensive proportion of the shoreline. Members can hire boats, as well as store boats from small dinghies to anchored cruisers.

There are also smaller buildings erected by Severn Trent, including a bird hide north of the visitor centre on the circular bike route, as well as other more minor wildlife-based buildings dotted around the track.

There are three car parks by the reservoir, main one at the site and a southerly one, Millfields, that has smaller capacity and a northerly one, Sheepwash, which has a similar capacity.

Birds seen at the site include little owl, little grebe, great northern diver, Eurasian oystercatcher, common tern and breeding common redshank. Feral barnacle geese are found there; a wild, ringed, barnacle goose was found in March 2011—it was ringed at WWT Caerlaverock in Dumfrieshire, Scotland on 8 February 1999.

Fly fishing is available from boats that can be hired from the Fishing Lodge. Fly fishing is for brown trout and rainbow trout only.

A horse riding track around the reservoir allows horse owners to ride round an 8 km route.

==Wildlife Discovery Room at Carsington Water==
The Wildlife Discovery Room at Carsington Water is operated as a partnership of Derbyshire Wildlife Trust and Severn Trent Water. The Trust offers nature programs for schools, children and families.

==Geochemical lessons from the Carsington dam failure of 1984 and reconstruction==
The failure in 1984 of the Carsington Dam near the end of its construction led to major advances in several areas of geotechnical engineering. It also led to major advances in understanding the nature and extent of geochemical and mineralogical reactions that can occur in earthworks, and how these can be allowed for in design and construction. These aspects had not been considered in the original investigations and design. This resulted in much greater degradation of the fill materials than expected during construction, the pollution of surface waters, and the deaths of four site personnel.

In the case of the Carsington Dam construction, it was hypothesized that autotrophic bacteria greatly accelerated the oxidation rate of the pyrite, so that it occurred within months during construction. The resulting sulfuric acid reacted with the drainage blanket constructed of carboniferous limestone, which then resulted in the precipitation of gypsum and iron hydroxide, the clogging of drains and the generation of carbon dioxide.

<doc id="445535" wikidata="Q1548588" url="?curid=445535" title="Southwest Territory">
<text>The Territory South of the River Ohio, more commonly known as the Southwest Territory or the old Southwest Territory, was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from May 26, 1790, until June 1, 1796, when it was admitted to the United States as the State of Tennessee. The Southwest Territory was created by the Southwest Ordinance which was similar to the previous two ordinances passed by the Confederation Congress for the parallel establishment and development of the old Northwest Territory of 1786–1803. It pertained to lands situated north of the Ohio River, around the Great Lakes and extending west to the Mississippi River. The lands of the Territory were taken from western areas beyond the mountains of the Commonwealth of Virginia (later to be separated and erected into the new 15th state of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.) Western lands were also ceded by the state of North Carolina from lands of the Washington District that had been already ceded to the U.S. federal government by North Carolina. 

The territory&#x27;s first—and only—appointed governor for its existence was William Blount, and the appointed secretary of the territory was Daniel Smith. Both were appointed by President George Washington.

The establishment of the Southwest Territory followed a series of efforts by North Carolina&#x27;s trans-Appalachian settlers to form a separate political entity, initially with the Watauga Association, and later with the failure of the additional proposed western State of Franklin. North Carolina ceded these lands in April 1790 as payment of obligations owed to the new central federal government. 

It was also along with the intention, that when the previous governing document for the newly independent United States of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union which were drawn up in 1776–1778 and adopted unanimously finally in 1781, that the territories west of the Appalachian Mountains would be ceded to the Confederation Congress, to be held in trust for all of the original Thirteen States, in order to settle and create in the future of new federal territories and states to be admitted to the Union on an equal basis and status. The Southwest Territory&#x27;s residents welcomed the cession, believing the federal government would provide better protection from native Indian hostilities. The federal government paid relatively little attention however to the territory, increasing its residents&#x27; desire for full statehood and admittance to the federal Union.

Along with Blount, a number of individuals who played prominent roles in early Tennessee history served in the old Southwest Territory&#x27;s administration. These included John Sevier, James Robertson, Griffith Rutherford, James Winchester, Archibald Roane, John McNairy, Joseph McMinn and General and future seventh President, Andrew Jackson.

==Background==


During the colonial period, land that would become the Southwest Territory was part of North Carolina&#x27;s land patent. The Blue Ridge Mountains, which rise along the modern Tennessee-North Carolina border, hindered North Carolina from pursuing any lasting interest in the territory. Initially trade, political interest, and settlement came mostly from Virginia and South Carolina, though refugees from the Regulator War began arriving from North Carolina in the early 1770s.

The Watauga Association was a semi-autonomous government created in 1772 by frontier settlers living along the Watauga River in what is present day Elizabethton, Tennessee. The colony was established on Cherokee-owned land in which the Watauga and Nolichucky settlers had negotiated a 10-year lease directly with the Indians. Fort Watauga was established on the Watauga River at Sycamore Shoals as a trade center of the settlements.

In March 1775, land speculator and North Carolina judge Richard Henderson met with more than 1,200 Cherokees at Sycamore Shoals. Included at the gathering were Cherokee leaders such as Attacullaculla, Oconostota, and Dragging Canoe. The meeting resulted in the &quot;Treaty of Sycamore Shoals&quot;, in which Henderson purchased from the Cherokee all the land situated south of the Ohio River and lying between the Cumberland River, the Cumberland Mountains, and the Kentucky River. This land, which encompassed roughly 20 million acres (80,000 km2), became known as the Transylvania Purchase. Henderson&#x27;s land deal was found to be in violation of North Carolina and Virginia law, as well as the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which had prohibited the private purchase of American Indian land.

Both North Carolina and Virginia considered the trans-Appalachian settlements illegal, and refused to annex them. Nevertheless, at the onset of the American War for Independence in 1776, the settlers, who vigorously supported the Patriot cause, organized themselves into the &quot;Washington District&quot; and formed a committee of safety to govern it. In July 1776, Dragging Canoe and the faction of the Cherokee opposed to the Transylvania Purchase (later called the Chickamaugas) aligned with the British and launched an invasion of the Watauga settlements, targeting Fort Watauga at modern Elizabethton and Eaton&#x27;s Station near modern Kingsport. After the settlers thwarted the attacks, North Carolina agreed to annex the settlements as the Washington District.

In September 1780, a large group of trans-Appalachian settlers, led by William Campbell, John Sevier and Isaac Shelby, assembled at Sycamore Shoals in response to a British threat to attack frontier settlements. Known as the Overmountain Men, the settlers marched across the mountains to South Carolina, where they engaged and defeated a loyalist force led by Patrick Ferguson at the Battle of Kings Mountain. Overmountain Men would also take part in the Battle of Musgrove Mill and the Battle of Cowpens.

In 1784, North Carolina ceded control of the Overmountain settlements following a hotly contested vote. The cession was rescinded later that year, but not before some of the settlers had organized the State of Franklin, which sought statehood. John Sevier was named governor and the area began operating as an independent state not recognized by the Congress of the Confederation. Many Overmountain settlers, led by John Tipton, remained loyal to North Carolina, and frequently quarreled with the Franklinites. Following Tipton&#x27;s defeat of Sevier at the &quot;Battle of Franklin&quot; in early 1788, the State of Franklin movement declined. The Franklinites had agreed to rejoin North Carolina by early 1789.

==Territory formation==
North Carolina ratified the United States Constitution on November 21, 1789. On December 22, the state legislature voted to cede the Overmountain settlements as payment of its obligations to the new federal government. Congress accepted the cession during its first session on April 2, 1790, when it passed &quot;An Act to Accept a Cession of the Claims of the State of North Carolina to a Certain District of Western Territory&quot;. On May 26, 1790, Congress passed an act organizing the new cession as the &quot;Territory of the United States South of the River Ohio&quot;, which consisted of modern Tennessee, with the exception of later minor boundary changes. However, most of the new territory was under Indian control, with territorial administration initially covering two unconnected areas—the Washington District in what is now northeast Tennessee, and the Mero District around Nashville. The act also merged the office of territorial governor with the office of Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Southern Department.
The new territory was essentially governed under the same provisions as the Northwest Ordinance, a 1787 act enacted for the creation of the Northwest Territory north of the Ohio River. The Northwest Ordinance&#x27;s provision outlawing slavery was not applied to the Southwest Territory, however. Along with rules of governance, the Ordinance outlined steps a territory could take to gain admission to the Union. The first step involved the organization of a territorial government. The next step, which would take place when the territory had at least 5,000 adult males, was to organize a territorial legislature, with a popularly elected lower chamber and an upper chamber appointed by the president. The final step, which would take place when the territory had a population of at least 60,000, was to write a state constitution and elect a state government, at which time the territory would be admitted to the Union.

Several candidates were put forth for governor of the new territory. William Blount, a Constitutional Convention delegate and former state legislator who had championed the causes of western settlers, was supported by key North Carolina politicians such as Hugh Williamson, Timothy Bloodworth, John B. Ashe and Benjamin Hawkins. Blount, an aggressive land speculator, had extensive land holdings in the new territory. Virginia&#x27;s Patrick Henry called for his friend, General Joseph Martin, to be appointed governor. A small group of ex-Franklinites convened in Greeneville to push for the appointment of John Sevier.

On June 8, 1790, President George Washington chose Blount as the territory&#x27;s new governor. He also appointed Daniel Smith the territory&#x27;s Secretary, and named two of the territory&#x27;s three judges, John McNairy and David Campbell (Joseph Anderson would eventually be chosen as the third judge). John Sevier was appointed brigadier general of the Washington District militia, and James Robertson was appointed brigadier general of the Mero District militia.

In September 1790, Blount visited Washington at Mount Vernon, and was sworn in by Supreme Court justice James Iredell. He then moved to the new territory, where he set up a temporary capital at Rocky Mount, the home of William Cobb in Sullivan County. He recruited North Carolina publisher George Roulstone to establish a newspaper, the &quot;Knoxville Gazette&quot; (initially published at Rogersville). He spent most of October and November issuing appointments to lower-level administrative and militia positions. In December, he made the dangerous trip across Indian territory to the Mero District, where he likewise issued appointments, before returning to Rocky Mount by the end of the year.

Blount initially wanted the permanent territorial capital to be located at the confluence of the Clinch and Tennessee rivers (in the vicinity of modern Kingston), where he had extensive land claims, but was unable to convince the Cherokee to relinquish ownership of these lands. He therefore chose James White&#x27;s Fort, an outpost located further upstream along the Tennessee. In 1791, White&#x27;s son-in-law, Charles McClung, platted the new city, and lots were sold in October of that year. Blount named the new city &quot;Knoxville&quot; after his superior in the War Department, Henry Knox.

In the 1790 United States census, 7 counties in the Southwest Territory reported the following population counts:
==Indian hostilities==

Residents of the Southwest Territory initially welcomed federal control, believing the federal government would provide better protection from hostile Indians than North Carolina&#x27;s distant government to the east. However, the Federal government was already more focused on critical affairs in the old Northwest Territory. Most of the land in the &quot;Old Southwest&quot; was still either Indian territory or had already been claimed by speculators or settlers, and thus there was little money to be made from land sales. President Washington issued a proclamation forbidding the violation of the Treaty of Hopewell (which had set Indian boundaries), and Secretary of War Knox frequently accused settlers of illegally encroaching on Indian lands. Blount was consistently torn between placating angry frontiersmen and appeasing his superiors in the Federal government.

In the Summer of 1791, Blount negotiated the Treaty of Holston with the Cherokee at the future site of Knoxville. The Treaty brought lands south of the French Broad River and east of the divide between Little River and the Little Tennessee River (essentially modern Cocke, Sevier and Blount counties) under U.S. control, and guaranteed the Territory use of a road between the Washington and Mero districts, as well as the Tennessee River. The following year, Blount negotiated an agreement clarifying land boundaries with the Chickasaw, who controlled what is now West Tennessee.

In spite of these agreements, continued encroachment by settlers onto Indian lands prompted reprisals, which primarily came from hostile Chickamauga Cherokee and Creek Indians. The Spanish, who controlled Florida along the Gulf of Mexico coast and still disputed the southern borders of the United States, fifteen years after the end of the Revolutionary War, encouraged and armed the southern tribes. These attacks persisted throughout 1792 and 1793, with the Mero settlements bearing the brunt of the hostilities. Ziegler&#x27;s Station near modern Hendersonville was destroyed, and Mero defenders had to rally to thwart a large invasion at Buchanan&#x27;s Station near Nashville. In spite of growing impatience from frontiersmen, Secretary of War Knox refused to authorize an invasion of Indian territory.

In September 1793, while Blount was away in Philadelphia, a large group of Cherokee invaders overran Cavet&#x27;s Station west of Knoxville, and were planning to march on Knoxville before the invading force dissolved due to infighting among chiefs. Territorial Secretary Daniel Smith, who was Acting Governor in Blount&#x27;s absence, summoned the militia and ordered an invasion of Cherokee territory. Militia General Sevier led the militia south and destroyed several Chickamauga villages. While Blount supported Smith&#x27;s decision, the invasion angered Knox, who refused to issue pay for the militiamen. In September 1794, Robertson, without authorization from Knox, dispatched a mounted American force under James Ore which destroyed the Chickamauga towns of Nickajack and Running Water. Robertson resigned as brigadier general shortly afterward.

The defeat of northern tribes at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in August 1794, the destruction of Nickajack and Running Water, and the resolving of boundary disputes between the United States and Spain led to a decline in hostile Indian attacks. In November 1794, Blount negotiated an end to the Cherokee–American wars at the Tellico Blockhouse, a federal outpost south of Knoxville.

==Statehood==
A census in the summer of 1791 showed the territory&#x27;s population to be 35,691. There were 6,271 free adult white males, more than the 5,000 needed for the territory to organize a legislature. Blount, however, waited until 1793 to call for elections. Members of the territorial House of Representatives (the lower chamber of the legislature) were elected in December 1793, and the first House session convened on February 24, 1794. The representatives nominated ten individuals for appointment to the territorial council (the legislature&#x27;s upper chamber), five of whom—Griffith Rutherford, John Sevier, James Winchester, Stockley Donelson and Parmenas Taylor—were eventually appointed by President Washington. Rutherford was chosen as the council&#x27;s president.

The assembly first convened on August 26, 1794, and called for immediate steps to be taken to achieve full statehood. The assembly appointed Dr. James White (not to be confused with Knoxville&#x27;s founder) as its non-voting representative in Congress, making the Southwest Territory one of the first U.S. territories to make use of this power. A special session of the assembly on June 29, 1795, called for a census to be taken the following month to determine if the territory&#x27;s population had reached the 60,000 threshold required for statehood. The census revealed a population of 77,262 inhabitants.

After the census, the territory moved swiftly to form a state government. In December 1795, counties elected delegates for the state constitutional convention. This convention met in Knoxville in January 1796, and drafted a new state constitution. The name &quot;Tennessee&quot;, which had been in common use since 1793 when Secretary Smith published his &quot;Short Description of the Tennassee Government&quot;, was chosen as the new name for the state.

The Northwest Ordinance was vague on the final steps to be taken for a state to be fully admitted to the Union, so Tennessee&#x27;s leaders proceeded to organize a state government. John Sevier was elected governor, the first Tennessee General Assembly convened in March 1796, and Blount notified the Secretary of State, Timothy Pickering, that the territorial government had been terminated. A copy of the state constitution was delivered to Pickering by future governor Joseph McMinn. Blount and William Cocke were chosen as the state&#x27;s U.S. Senators, and Andrew Jackson was elected the state&#x27;s representative. As the Southwest Territory was the first federal territory to petition to join the Union, there was confusion in Congress about how to proceed. Nonetheless, Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796, as the 16th state.

==Government and law==




The Southwest Territory was governed under an act of Congress, &quot;An Act for the Government of the Territory of the United States, South of the River Ohio&quot; (Southwest Ordinance), passed May 26, 1790. This act essentially mirrored the earlier Northwest Ordinance, the key difference being over slavery, which was prohibited by the Northwest Ordinance, but not the Southwest Ordinance. Both ordinances provided for freedom of religion and the sanctity of contracts, barred legal primogeniture, and encouraged the establishment of schools and respect for the liberty of the Indians.

The supreme power in the territory rested in the governor, who was appointed by the President of the United States. He was assisted by the Secretary, also appointed by the President. Legislative powers rested in a bicameral territorial assembly consisting of the House of Representatives (lower chamber) and the Territorial Council (upper chamber). Representatives were popularly elected, whereas councilors were appointed by the President. Judicial power rested in three judges appointed by the President. Brigadier generals of the territorial militia were also appointed by the President. Lower administrative, judicial and military officers were appointed by the governor.

===Executive===

The Governor of the Southwest Territory had supreme authority in the territory. The governor could decree ordinances, propose and enact new laws, create towns and counties, and license lawyers. Though the territorial assembly held legislative powers, the governor held veto power over all proposed laws. The governor was responsible for appointing the lower territorial administrative officers, including attorneys general, justices of the peace, registers, and court clerks. He recommended candidates for brigadier general to the President, and appointed lower militia officers. The governor also served as the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Southern Department, the federal government&#x27;s chief diplomat to the Southern tribes. To serve as governor, an individual had to own at least of land in the territory. William Blount served as Governor of the Southwest Territory throughout the territory&#x27;s existence.

The Secretary of the Southwest Territory was the official record-keeper of the territory. The Secretary also served as acting governor if the governor was absent or incapacitated. To serve as Secretary, an individual had to own at least of land in the territory. Daniel Smith served as Secretary throughout the territory&#x27;s existence.

===Legislature===

Legislative power in the Southwest Territory initially rested with the governor, who consulted with the three territorial judges on new laws. After the territory&#x27;s population of white males reached 5,000, the territory could form a legislative assembly (the power to summon the assembly rested with the governor). The assembly consisted of an upper chamber, the Territorial Council (the role of which was similar to that of a state senate), and a lower chamber, the House of Representatives. While the assembly could propose new laws, the governor could still veto any bill. To serve on the council, an individual had to own at least of land in the territory.

The territorial House of Representatives consisted of thirteen popularly elected members. These members elected a speaker from their own ranks. The House first convened at Knoxville on February 24, 1794. Its members were John Tipton (Washington), George Rutledge (Sullivan), Joseph Hardin (Greene), William Cocke (Hawkins), Joseph McMinn (Hawkins), Alexander Kelly (Knox), John Beard (Knox), Samuel Wear (Jefferson), George Doharty (Jefferson), David Wilson (Sumner), Dr. James White (Davidson) and James Ford (Tennessee County). Wilson, of Sumner County, served as Speaker from 1794 to 1795. Hardin, of Greene, served as Speaker from 1795 to 1796. Hopkins Lacy was elected clerk.

Members of the territorial council were appointed by the President from a list of candidates submitted by the territorial House of Representatives. At its first session in February 1794, the House submitted ten candidates for the council: James Winchester, William Fort, Stockley Donelson, Richard Gammon, David Russell, John Sevier, Adam Meek, John Adair, Griffith Rutherford and Parmenas Taylor. From this list, President Washington appointed Winchester, Donelson, Sevier, Rutherford and Taylor. Rutherford was chosen as council president (a role similar to speaker).

The Northwest Ordinance allowed a territory&#x27;s assembly to elect a representative to the United States Congress. This representative could consult with congressmen on legislation, but could not vote. In 1794, the Southwest Territory&#x27;s assembly chose Dr. James White as its non-voting representative to Congress. The Southwest Territory was the first U.S. territory to exercise this power, and White&#x27;s efforts in Congress set a precedent for future territorial delegates.

===Judiciary===

The territory&#x27;s supreme judicial power rested in three judges, each appointed by the President. The governor appointed court clerks, attorneys general and lower judicial offices, as well as justices of the peace. Along with their judicial powers, the judges could consult with the governor on new legislation, though the governor held final veto power over any proposed laws. To serve as a judge, an individual had to own at least of land in the territory. The judges appointed by President Washington in 1790 were John McNairy (1762–1837), David Campbell (1750–1812), and Joseph Anderson (1757–1837). Blount appointed Francis Alexander Ramsey clerk of the Washington District&#x27;s superior court of law, Andrew Russell clerk of the Washington District&#x27;s court of equity, David Allison clerk of Mero&#x27;s superior court of law, and Joseph Sitgreaves clerk of Mero&#x27;s court of equity.

The courts of the Southwest Territory were generally more highly regarded than other branches of government. Frontiersmen had for years relied on county courts to settle disputes, and upon being appointed governor, Blount left the existing county courts largely intact. These courts generally followed old North Carolina laws when rendering decisions, relying heavily on James Iredell&#x27;s &quot;Revisal of the Laws of North Carolina&quot; (1791). Along with hearing criminal and civil cases, courts were responsible for licensing ferries, regulating taverns, and designating public gristmills. Courts occasionally rendered financial assistance for internal improvements and relief for the destitute. County sheriffs were responsible for collecting taxes.

Lawyers were licensed by the governor to practice in the territory&#x27;s courts. Notable individuals licensed to practice in the territory included future president Andrew Jackson, future governor Archibald Roane, future congressman John Rhea, and Blount&#x27;s younger half-brother, future governor Willie Blount. Jackson served as a district attorney for the territory.

==Land details==
The Southwest Territory covered , consisting of what is now Tennessee, with the exception of a few minor boundary changes resulting from later surveys. To its north was Virginia&#x27;s District of Kentucky, which became the 15th U.S. state in 1792. The lands to the territory&#x27;s south were at the time either still claimed by Georgia, or disputed with Spain, but subsequently consolidated into the Mississippi Territory.

At its creation in 1790, the Southwest Territory&#x27;s administration oversaw two unconnected districts—the Washington District in the northeast, and the Mero District in the area around and north of Nashville. The remainder of the territory remained under Indian control, with the Cherokee being the dominant tribe in the east, and the Chickasaw controlling the western part of the territory. Other important tribes included the Creeks and Choctaw.

The Washington District initially included lands north of the French Broad River and northeast of the confluence of the Clinch and Tennessee rivers (near modern Kingston). The 1791 Treaty of Holston pushed the boundary south of the French Broad and southeast to the divide between Little River and the Little Tennessee River (in what is now southern Blount County). The Washington District originally included Washington, Sullivan, Greene and Hawkins counties. Knox and Jefferson were created by Governor Blount in 1792. In 1793, Blount organized these two new counties into a separate district, called the &quot;Hamilton District&quot;. Blount and Sevier counties would be added to this new district during territorial administration.

The Mero District included the lands around Nashville and along the Cumberland River, north to the modern Kentucky border. It included three counties—Davidson, Sumner and Tennessee. The Mero and Washington districts were connected by a road, generally known as Avery&#x27;s Trace, which traversed Indian lands.

The population of the Southwest Territory in 1791 was 35,691. This included 3,417 slaves and 361 free persons of color. The population of the Washington District was 28,649, while the population of Mero was 7,042. The territory&#x27;s 1795 census showed a total population of 77,262 inhabitants, including 10,613 slaves and 973 free persons of color. The population of the Washington and Hamilton districts was 65,338, and the population of Mero was 11,924.

<text>An oven is a tool that is used to expose materials to a hot environment. Ovens contain a hollow chamber and provide a means of heating the chamber in a controlled way. In use since antiquity, they have been used to accomplish a wide variety of tasks requiring controlled heating. Because they are used for a variety of purposes, there are many different types of ovens. These types differ depending on their intended purpose and based upon how they generate heat.

Ovens are often used for cooking, usually baking, sometimes broiling; they can be used to heat food to a desired temperature. Ovens are also used in the manufacturing of ceramics and pottery; these ovens are sometimes referred to as kilns. Metallurgical furnaces are ovens used in the manufacturing of metals, while glass furnaces are ovens used to produce glass.

There are many methods by which different types of ovens produce heat. Some ovens heat materials using the combustion of a fuel, such as wood, coal, or natural gas, while many employ electricity. Microwave ovens heat materials by exposing them to microwave radiation, while electric ovens and electric furnaces heat materials using resistive heating. Some ovens use forced convection, the movement of gases inside the heating chamber, to enhance the heating process, or, in some cases, to change the properties of the material being heated, such as in the Bessemer method of steel production.

== History ==
The earliest ovens were found in Central Europe and date back to 29,000 BC. They were roasting and boiling pits inside yurts used to cook mammoth. In Ukraine from 20,000 BC they used pits with hot coals covered in ashes. Food was wrapped in leaves and set on top, then covered with earth. In camps found in Mezhirich, each mammoth bone house had a hearth used for heating and cooking. Ovens were used by cultures who lived in the Indus Valley and in pre-dynastic Egypt. By 3200 BC, each mud-brick house had an oven in settlements across the Indus Valley. Ovens were used to cook food and to make bricks. Pre-dynastic civilizations in Egypt used kilns around 5000–4000 BC to make pottery.

Tandır ovens used to bake unleavened flatbread were common in Anatolia during the Seljuk and Ottoman eras and have been found at archaeological sites distributed across the Middle East. The word &quot;tandır&quot; comes from the Akkadian &quot;tinuru&quot;, which becomes &quot;tanur&quot; in Hebrew and Arabic, and &quot;tandır&quot; in Turkish. Of the hundreds of bread varieties known from cuneiform sources, unleavened tinuru bread was made by adhering bread to the side walls of a heated cylindrical oven. This type of bread is still central to rural food culture in this part of the world, reflected by the local folklore, in which a young man and woman sharing fresh tandır bread is a symbol of young love. However, the culture of traditional bread baking is changing with younger generations, especially with those who reside in towns and prefer modern conveniences.

During the Middle Ages, instead of earth and ceramic ovens, Europeans used fireplaces in conjunction with large cauldrons. These were similar to the Dutch oven. After the Middle Ages, ovens underwent many changes over time from wood, iron, coal, gas, and even electric. Each design had its own motivation and purpose. The wood-burning stoves saw improvement through the addition of fire chambers that allowed better containment and release of smoke. Another recognizable oven would be the cast-iron stove. These were first used around the early 1700s, when they themselves underwent several variations including the Stewart Oberlin iron stove that was smaller and had its own chimney.

In the early part of the 19th century, the coal oven was developed. It was cylindrical in shape and made of heavy cast iron. The gas oven saw its first use as early as the beginning of the 19th century as well. Gas stoves became very common household ovens once gas lines were available to most houses and neighborhoods. James Sharp patented one of the first gas stoves in 1826. Other improvements to the gas stove included the AGA cooker, invented in 1922 by Gustaf Dalén. The first electric ovens were invented in the very late 19th century; however, like many electrical inventions destined for commercial use, mass ownership of electrical ovens could not be a reality until a better and more efficient use of electricity was available.

Over time, ovens have become more high-tech in terms of cooking strategy. The microwave as a cooking tool was discovered by Percy Spencer in 1946, and with help from engineers, the microwave oven was patented. The microwave oven uses microwave radiation to excite water molecules in food, causing friction and thus producing heat.

== Types ==


; Double oven : A built-in oven fixture that has either two ovens, or one oven and one microwave oven. It is usually built into the kitchen cabinet.
; Earth oven : An earth oven is a pit dug into the ground and then heated, usually by rocks or smoldering debris. Historically these have been used by many cultures for cooking. Cooking times are usually long, and the process is usually cooking by slow roasting the food. Earth ovens are among the most common things archaeologists look for at an anthropological dig, as they are one of the key indicators of human civilization and static society.
; Ceramic oven : The ceramic oven is an oven constructed of clay or any other ceramic material and takes different forms depending on the culture. The Indians refer to it as a tandoor, and use it for cooking. They can be dated back as far as 3,000 BC, and they have been argued to have their origins in the Indus Valley. Brick ovens are also another ceramic type oven. A culture most notable for the use of brick ovens is Italy and its intimate history with pizza. However, its history also dates further back to Roman times, wherein the brick oven was used not only for commercial use but household use as well.
; Gas oven : One of the first recorded uses of a gas stove and oven referenced a dinner party in 1802 hosted by Zachaus Winzler, where all the food was prepared either on a gas stove or in its oven compartment. In 1834, British inventor James Sharp began to commercially produce gas ovens after installing one in his own house. In 1851, the Bower&#x27;s Registered Gas Stove was displayed at the Great Exhibition. This stove would set the standard and basis for the modern gas oven. Notable improvements to the gas stove since include the addition of the thermostat which assisted in temperature regulation; also an enamel coating was added to the production of gas stoves and ovens in order to help with easier cleaning.
; Electric oven : These produce their heat electrically, often via resistive heating.
; Toaster oven : Toaster ovens are small electric ovens with a front door, wire rack and removable baking pan. To toast bread with a toaster oven, slices of bread are placed horizontally on the rack. When the toast is done, the toaster turns off, but in most cases the door must be opened manually. Most toaster ovens are significantly larger than toasters, but are capable of performing most of the functions of electric ovens, albeit on a much smaller scale. 
; Masonry oven : Masonry ovens consist of a baking chamber made of fireproof brick, concrete, stone, or clay. Though traditionally wood-fired, coal-fired ovens were common in the 19th century. Modern masonry ovens are often fired with natural gas or even electricity, and are closely associated with artisanal bread and pizza. In the past, however, they were also used for any cooking task that required baking.
; Microwave oven : An oven that cooks food using microwave radiation rather than infrared radiation (typically a fire source). Conceptualized in 1946, Dr. Percy Spencer allegedly discovered the heating properties of microwaves while studying the magnetron. By 1947, the first commercial microwave was in use in Boston, Massachusetts.
; Wall oven : Wall ovens make it easier to work with large roasting pans and Dutch ovens. A width is typically 24, 27, or 30 inches. Mounted at waist or eye level, a wall oven eliminates bending. However, it can be nested under a countertop to save space. A separate wall oven is expensive compared with a range.
; Steam oven : An oven that cooks food using steam to provide heat.

Some ovens can perform in multiple ways, sometimes at once. Combination ovens may be able to microwave and conventional heating such as baking or grilling simultaneously.

== Uses ==

=== Cooking ===

Ovens are used as kitchen appliances for roasting and heating. Foods normally cooked in this manner include meat, casseroles and baked goods such as bread, cake and other desserts. In modern times, the oven is used to cook and heat food in many households around the globe.

Modern ovens are typically fueled by either natural gas or electricity, with bottle gas models available but not common. When an oven is contained in a complete stove, the fuel used for the oven may be the same as or different from the fuel used for the burners on top of the stove.

Ovens usually can use a variety of methods to cook. The most common may be to heat the oven from below. This is commonly used for baking and roasting. The oven may also be able to heat from the top to provide broiling (US) or grilling (UK/Commonwealth). A fan-assisted oven that uses a small fan to circulate the air in the cooking chamber, can be used. Both are also known as convection ovens. An oven may also provide an integrated rotisserie.

Ovens also vary in the way that they are controlled. The simplest ovens (for example, the AGA cooker) may not have any controls at all; the ovens simply run continuously at various temperatures. More conventional ovens have a simple thermostat which turns the oven on and off and selects the temperature at which it will operate. Set to the highest setting, this may also enable the broiler element. A timer may allow the oven to be turned on and off automatically at pre-set times. More sophisticated ovens may have complex, computer-based controls allowing a wide variety of operating modes and special features including the use of a temperature probe to automatically shut the oven off when the food is completely cooked to the desired degree.

&quot;Toaster ovens&quot; are essentially small-scale ovens and can be used to cook foods other than just toasting. A frontal door is opened, horizontally-oriented bread slices (or other food items) are placed on a rack that has heat elements above and below it, and the door is closed. The controls are set and actuated to toast the bread to the desired doneness, whereupon the heat elements are switched off. In most cases, the door must be opened manually, though there are also toaster ovens with doors that open automatically. Because the bread is horizontal, a toaster oven can be used to cook toast with toppings, like garlic bread, melt sandwiches, or toasted cheese. Toaster ovens are generally slower to make toast than pop-up toasters, taking 4–6 minutes as compared to 2–3 minutes. In addition to the automatic-toasting settings, toaster ovens typically have settings and temperature controls to allow use of the appliance as a small oven.

Extra features on toaster ovens can include:

* Heating element control options, such as a &quot;top brown&quot; setting that powers only the upper elements so food can be broiled without heat from below.
* Multiple shelf racks – Having options for positioning the oven shelf gives more control over the distance between food and the heating element.

=== Industrial, scientific, and artisanal ===
Outside the culinary world, ovens are used for a number of purposes:

* A furnace can be used either to provide heat to a building or used to melt substances such as glass or metal for further processing. A blast furnace is a particular type of furnace generally associated with metal smelting (particularly steel manufacture) using refined coke or similar hot-burning substance as a fuel, with air pumped in under pressure to increase the temperature of the fire. A blacksmith uses a temporarily blown furnace, the smith&#x27;s heart to heat iron to a glowing red to yellow temperature.
* A kiln is a high-temperature oven used in wood drying, ceramics and cement manufacturing to convert mineral feedstock (in the form of clay or calcium or aluminum rocks) into a glassier, more solid form. In the case of ceramic kilns, a shaped clay object is the final result, while cement kilns produce a substance called clinker that is crushed to make the final cement product. (Certain types of drying ovens used in food manufacture, especially those used in malting, are also referred to as kilns.)
* An autoclave is an oven-like device with features similar to a pressure cooker that allows the heating of aqueous solutions to higher temperatures than water&#x27;s boiling point in order to sterilize the contents of the autoclave.
* Industrial ovens are similar to their culinary equivalents and are used for a number of different applications that do not require the high temperatures of a kiln or furnace.

<text>Lupinus arboreus, the yellow bush lupine (US) or tree lupin (UK), is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae.

==Description==
&quot;Lupinus arboreus&quot; is an evergreen shrub growing to tall (hence the alternative common name, tree lupine) in sheltered situations, but more typically tall. It is capable of tolerating temperatures down to −12 °C and living for up to seven years.

It has green to gray-green palmate leaves, with 5–12 leaflets per leaf. The leaflets are long, often sparsely covered with fine silky hairs.

In spring it bears many racemes, long, of fragrant, soft yellow, pea-like flowers. Both yellow and lilac to purple flowering forms are known. However, the yellow form is more common, except in the north of the species&#x27; range.

==Distribution==
The shrub is indigenous to California, US, where it is widely distributed among coastal sage scrub and sand dunes. Because it has been widely introduced in the state, there is some uncertainty about its native range. It is thought to be native from Point Reyes National Seashore south to San Luis Obispo County.

==Invasive species==
It has escaped from cultivation to become an invasive species in many areas. Outside of its native range in central and northern coastal California, it can become invasive southwards in Southern California and Baja California, and northwards in the coastal Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. It is an introduced species in western Europe, Australia (a potential noxious weed), New Zealand, the Turkish Anatolian Aegean Region, and southern South America including the Falkland Islands.

Like many members of the Fabaceae, it is an effective fixer of nitrogen in the soil. Where it has been introduced, it changes the chemistry of the soil, and therefore allows other exotics to establish themselves, to the detriment of native plants adapted to low nitrogen levels. It also hybridizes with other lupine species outside its range, such as &quot;Lupinus littoralis&quot; (seashore lupin) and &quot;Lupinus rivularis&quot; (riverbank lupin), further endangering the survival of those native ecosystem integrated species.
==Cultivation==
The yellow-flowering form of &quot;Lupinus arboreus&quot; is widely grown as an ornamental plant, for its attractive flowers in traditional, native plant, and wildlife gardens. It is also used to bind drifting sand dunes. It can be seen growing in cracks in vertical stone walls, due to the sharp drainage. Lupins can also be cultivated on balconies or patios in pots.

It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Related shrub species==
In addition to the numerous annual and perennial lupines, some other Lupine species also naturally grow as shrubs, including:
*&quot;Lupinus chamissonis&quot; – Chamisso bush lupine, silver bush lupine
*&quot;Lupinus albifrons&quot; – Bush lupine
*&quot;Lupinus excubitus&quot; – Grape soda lupine
*&quot;Lupinus longifolius&quot; – Longleaf bush lupine

<doc id="445551" wikidata="Q50185" url="?curid=445551" title="Louis Couperin">
<text>Louis Couperin (; – 29 August 1661) was a French Baroque composer and performer. He was born in Chaumes-en-Brie and moved to Paris in 1650–1651 with the help of Jacques Champion de Chambonnières. Couperin worked as organist of the Church of St. Gervais in Paris and as musician at the court. He quickly became one of the most prominent Parisian musicians, establishing himself as a harpsichordist, organist, and violist, but his career was cut short by his early death at the age of thirty-five.

None of Couperin&#x27;s music was published during his lifetime, but manuscript copies of some 200 pieces survive, some of them only rediscovered in the mid-20th century. The first historically important member of the Couperin family, Couperin made contributions to the development of both the French organ school and the French harpsichord school. His innovations included composing organ pieces for specific registrations and inventing the genre of the unmeasured prelude for harpsichord, for which he devised a special type of notation.

==Life==
Most of the information about Couperin&#x27;s life comes from two sources. &quot;Le Parnasse François&quot;, a 1732 book by Évrard Titon du Tillet, contains a biographical sketch describing certain details of his life, and some 30 organ pieces listed not only the date but also the place of composition. Couperin was born around 1626 in Chaumes-en-Brie, a town 40 km south-east of Paris. His father, Charles Couperin, sieur de Crouilly, was a small landowner and part-time organist of a local church. Louis was reportedly an accomplished harpsichordist and violinist by 1650 (and was already composing by then), but had no connections whatsoever with any important musicians of the era. His sudden rise to fame, which happened during 1650–1651, is explained in &quot;Le Parnasse François&quot;. Titon du Tillet writes that Louis, his two younger brothers Charles and François, and some of their friends visited Jacques Champion de Chambonnières on the Feast of Saint James—Chambonnières&#x27; name day. The Couperins offered the host and his guests a short concert, playing several pieces composed by Louis. Chambonnières was impressed by Louis Couperin&#x27;s talents, became his teacher and persuaded him to settle in Paris. There Chambonnières, who was the most prominent French harpsichordist of his time and musician to the King, introduced the young musician to the Court. Couperin&#x27;s talents met with appreciation; by 1651 he was already living in the city.

He almost certainly met Johann Jakob Froberger in 1651–1652; Froberger&#x27;s style becoming a major influence on Couperin&#x27;s music. On 9 April 1653 he became organist of the Parisian church of St. Gervais, where he was paid 400 &quot;livres&quot; a year, plus lodgings. The position at this ancient church was one of the most important in France at the time. At some point — most probably after he became organist at St. Gervais — Couperin entered the royal service as a treble viol player. Titon du Tillet writes that Couperin had refused, out of loyalty to his old friend and teacher, to replace Chambonnières as royal harpsichordist, and so the post of violist was created especially for him. On 22 October 1655, he stood godfather to his sister&#x27;s child at Chaumes-en-Brie; from July to October 1656 and around November 1658 he was frequently travelling to Meudon, where he was probably employed by Abel Servien, a diplomat and statesman. He traveled to Toulouse with the court in 1659. During his last years, Couperin lived in the organist&#x27;s lodgings at St. Gervais with his two brothers. He died on 29 August 1661, aged thirty-five according to &quot;Le Parnasse François&quot;.

His brothers both played an important role in the development of French Baroque music. No compositions by François (known as &quot;The Elder&quot; or &quot;Couperin de Crouilly&quot;) are known to survive, but his line of the family carried the name of Couperin into the 19th century. Charles Couperin (known as &quot;Couperin-cadet&quot;) succeeded Louis as organist at St. Gervais and, in 1668, produced an only child, François Couperin le Grand, who became one of the most important French composers of the late Baroque era.

==Works==
===Provenance and catalogues===

Because his career spanned only some 10 years, none of Couperin&#x27;s works were published during his lifetime. There are two major manuscript sources for his music: 
#The Bauyn manuscript (Bibliothèque nationale de France, Rés. Vm7 674–675), dating from ca. 1690, is one of the most important sources for French keyboard music of the 17th century (particularly the work of Chambonnières). It contains 122 harpsichord pieces by Couperin, as well as four organ pieces and 5 chamber works. 
#The so-called Oldham manuscript (a private collection of G. Oldham), recovered only in 1957, contains 70 organ works by Couperin, of which 68 are unique to this source. Also included are a harpsichord suite, four five-part chamber &quot;fantaisies&quot;, and two pieces for shawm band. This manuscript may have been compiled at least partly during Couperin&#x27;s lifetime, and is the only such source for his music.
In addition to these, the Parville manuscript contains 55 harpsichord pieces by Couperin, although only five of these are unique (the rest are included in the Bauyn manuscript).

Couperin&#x27;s harpsichord works are commonly referred to by numbers used in the &quot;princeps&quot; Éditions de l&#x27;Oiseau-Lyre edition of 1936. The edition was based entirely on the Bauyn manuscript, the only source known at that time. The authors of the manuscript did not arrange the pieces in suites, but rather grouped dances by key first and by genre second. So, for example, numbers 16–19 are courantes in C major, numbers 20–25 are sarabandes in C major, etc. Some editions and recordings may use Davitt Moroney&#x27;s alternative numbering scheme, which attempts to create suites out of Couperin&#x27;s dances.

The numbering scheme for Couperin&#x27;s organ pieces also reflects their source, the Oldham manuscript. Here, however, no attempt was made by the copyist to group pieces in any way. The manuscript draws on at least two &quot;grands livres d&#x27;orgue&quot;, and the copyist apparently chose pieces arbitrarily. Distinguishing the many &quot;fantaisies&quot; is made easier, however, because Couperin would frequently provide the date and sometimes the place of composition in a footnote. Numbers 11 and 19, for instance, are both titled &quot;fugue&quot;, but the former is inscribed &quot;Couperin a Meudon le 18e Juillet [July] 1656&quot;, and the latter &quot;Couperin a paris le 1er 7ber [September] 1656&quot;. This extraordinary feature, which is unique for the period, allows tracing Couperin&#x27;s development as organ composer from 1650 to 1659, sometimes almost day by day.

Harpsichordist Skip Sempé, as well as a few scholars, have questioned the attribution of both the harpsichord pieces of the Bauyn manuscript and the organ pieces of the Oldham manuscript to Couperin, on stylistic grounds.

===Harpsichord music===

Dance movements comprise around two thirds of Louis Couperin&#x27;s harpsichord oeuvre; they include courantes, sarabandes, allemandes and gigues (in decreasing order of numbers). These pieces are more complex than those by Chambonnières and display more variety within an individual piece. These pieces were not organized into suites, but contemporary performers arrange pieces in the same key into ad hoc suites for a given performance or recording. His reputation as a composer comes mainly from his chaconnes, passacaglias and unmeasured preludes. These latter pieces, written out in a unique kind of notation (whole notes only, arranged in groups and connected by graceful curves) are influenced by Froberger&#x27;s free-flowing allemandes and programmatic pieces; some borrow short passages from his toccatas.

===Organ music===
Couperin&#x27;s organ music exerted a great influence over 17th century European composers; it represents the transition from the strict counterpoint in the Titelouze vein to the colorful, concertante organ style introduced by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers and Nicolas Lebègue, who influenced late Baroque composers such as François Couperin and Nicolas de Grigny. Couperin was the first French composer to write for specific registrations and also the first to compose leaping division basses in the style of divisions for the bass viol. Both of these stylistic traits are among the defining characteristics of French organ music of the 17th and the 18th centuries.

<doc id="445565" wikidata="Q1348449" url="?curid=445565" title="Meganthropus">
<text>Meganthropus is an extinct genus of non-hominin hominid ape, known from the Pleistocene of Indonesia. It is known from a series of large jaw and skull fragments found at the Sangiran site near Surakarta in Central Java, Indonesia, alongside several isolated teeth. The genus has a long and convoluted taxonomic history. The original fossils were ascribed to a new species, Meganthropus palaeojavanicus, and for a long time was considered invalid, with the genus name being used as an informal name for the fossils.

In the mid-2000s the taxonomy and phylogeny for the specimens were uncertain, and most paleoanthropologists considered them related to &quot;Homo erectus&quot; in some way. However, the names &quot;Homo palaeojavanicus&quot; and even &quot;Australopithecus palaeojavanicus&quot; were used as well, indicating the classification uncertainty.

After the discovery of a robust skull in Swartkrans in 1948 (SK48), the name &quot;Meganthropus africanus&quot; was briefly applied. However, that specimen is now formally known as &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot; and the earlier name is a junior synonym. Some of these finds were accompanied by evidence of tool use similar to that of &quot;Homo erectus&quot;; this is why &quot;Meganthropus&quot; was often linked with that species as H. e. palaeojavanicus. In 2019, a study of tooth morphology found &quot;Meganthropus&quot; a valid genus of non-hominin hominid ape, most closely related to &quot;Lufengpithecus.&quot;

== Fossil finds ==
The number of fossil finds has been relatively small, and it is a distinct possibility that they are a paraphyletic assemblage. Due to this, they will be discussed in detail separately.

=== &quot;Meganthropus&quot; A/Sangiran 6 ===
This large jaw fragment was first found in 1941 by Gustav von Koenigswald. Koenigswald was captured by the Japanese in World War II, but managed to send a cast of the jaw to Franz Weidenreich. Weidenreich described and named the specimen in 1945, and was struck by its size, as it was the largest hominid jaw then known. The jaw was roughly the same height as a gorilla&#x27;s, but had a different form. Whereas in anthropoids the mandible has its greatest height at the symphysis, that is, where the two rami of the lower jaw meet, this is not the case in Sangiran 6, where the greatest height is seen at about the position of the first molar (M1).

Weidenreich considered acromegalic gigantism, but ruled it out for not having typical features such as an exaggerated chin and small teeth compared to the jaw&#x27;s size. Weidenreich never made a direct size estimate of the hominid it came from, but said it was 2/3 the size of &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;, which was twice as large as a gorilla, which would make it somewhere around 8 feet (2.44 m) tall and approximately 400 to 600 lbs (181 – 272 kg) if scaled on the same proportions as a robust man or erect hominid. In his book &quot;Apes, Giants, and Man&quot;, Weidenreich states the following:
The jawbone was apparently used in part of Grover Krantz&#x27;s skull reconstruction, which was only tall.

=== &quot;Meganthropus&quot; B/Sangiran 8 ===
This was another jaw fragment described by Marks in 1953. It was around the same size and shape as the original mandible, but it was also severely damaged. Recent work by a Japanese/Indonesian team repaired the fossil, which was an adult, and showed it to be smaller than known specimens of &quot;H. erectus&quot;. Curiously, the specimen did retain several traits unique to the first mandibular find and not known in &quot;H. erectus&quot;. No size estimates have been made yet.

===&quot;Meganthropus&quot; C/Sangiran 33/BK 7905===
This jaw fragment was discovered in 1979, and has some characteristics in common with previous 
mandible finds. Its connection with &quot;Meganthropus&quot; appears to be the most tenuous out of the mandibular discoveries.

===&quot;Meganthropus&quot; D===
This mandible and ramus was acquired by Sartono in 1993, and has been dated to between 1.4 and 0.9 million years ago. The ramus portion is badly damaged, but the mandible fragment appears relatively unharmed, although details of the teeth have been lost. It is slightly smaller than &quot;Meganthropus&quot; A and very similar in shape. Sartono, Tyler, and Krantz agreed that &quot;Meganthropus&quot; A and D were very likely to be representations of the same species, whatever it turns out to be.

===&quot;Meganthropus&quot; I/Sangiran 27===
Tyler described this specimen as being a nearly complete but crushed cranium within the size limit of &quot;Meganthropus&quot; and outside the (assumed) limit of &quot;H. erectus&quot;. The specimen was unusual for having a double temporal ridge (sagittal crest), which almost meets at the top of the cranium, and a heavily thickened nuchal ridge.

===&quot;Meganthropus&quot; II/Sangiran 31===
This skull fragment was first described by Sartono in 1982. Tyler&#x27;s analysis came to the conclusion that it was out of the normal range of &quot;H. erectus&quot;. The cranium was deeper, lower vaulted, and wider than any specimen previously recovered. It had the same double sagittal crest or double temporal ridge with a cranial capacity of around 800–1000cc. Since its presentation at the AAPA meeting in 1993, Tyler&#x27;s reconstruction of Sangiran 31 has been accepted by most authorities.

As with most fossils it was heavily damaged, but given the completeness of the post facial cranium the chances of error in its reconstruction are very small. Tyler&#x27;s accepted reconstruction of Sangiran 31 shows a double temporal ridge. The temporal muscles extend to the top of the parietal where they almost join. There are no other &quot;Homo erectus&quot; specimens that exhibit this trait. Krantz&#x27;s reconstruction of Sangiran 31 as a giant &quot;Homo habilis&quot; has been found to be dubious at best.

===&quot;Meganthropus&quot; III===
This is another fossil with only tenuous ties to &quot;Meganthropus&quot;. It is what seems to be the posterior part of a hominid cranium, measuring about 10 to 7 cm. It has been described by Tyler (1996), who found that the occipital angle of the whole cranium must have been at about 120°, which according to him would be out of the known range of &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, the latter having a much more angled occiput. His interpretation of the cranial fragment was, however, questioned by other authorities, to include doubts that the fragment was actually the part of a skull that Tyler had thought it to be.

==Scientific interpretation==

===&quot;H. erectus&quot;===
The majority of paleoanthropologists considered the &quot;Meganthropus&quot; fossil remains as falling within the variation of &quot;H. erectus&quot;. As Kaifu &quot;et al&quot;. (2005) note: &quot;If we take the conservative standpoint that all earlier &quot;Homo&quot; populations that are sufficiently derived from African early &quot;Homo&quot; belong to &quot;H. erectus&quot;, the Grenzbank/Sangiran group is allocated to a primitive group of this species.&quot; However some argued that the &quot;Meganthropus&quot; fossils warranted a separate species or &quot;H. erectus&quot; subspecies, proposing the names &quot;H. palaeojavanicus&quot; or &quot;H. e. palaeojavanicus&quot; based on their overall primitiveness, such as low cranial capacity (Tyler, 2001). Against this view, Wolpoff (1999) argued for strong similarities between earlier and later Javanese fossils and no species nor subspecies distinction.

===Australopithecine===
Robinson (1953) first suggested that &quot;Meganthropus&quot; (based on the Sangiran 6 mandibular fragment) could be a Southeast Asian representative of robust australopithecines. A similar theory was proposed by Krantz (1975) who argued that Sangiran 6 is: &quot;entirely outside the possible size range of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; and should be classed as &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;&quot; (i.e. gracile as opposed to robust australopithecine). According to Koenigswald (1973) both robust and gracile australopithecine traits can be found in Sangiran 6: &quot;In certain respects the lower jaw of &quot;Meganthropus&quot; combines characteristics of &quot;A. africanus&quot; (premolars) with those of &quot;A. robustus&quot; (size).&quot;

A study by Orban-Segebarth &amp; Procureur (1983) of the Sangiran 6 mandible also concluded: &quot;Asiatic &quot;Meganthropus&quot; &#x27;Sangiran 6&#x27; has marked australopithecoid traits&quot; but Kramer and Konigsberg (1994) challenge this view. According to Cartmill and Smith (2009): &quot;there is no compelling reason to remove any of the &#x27;Meganthropus&#x27; specimens from &quot;H. erectus&quot;&quot;.

=== Non-hominin hominid ===
The concept of a &quot;mystery ape&quot; most closely related to &quot;Lufengpithecus&quot; in the Javan Pleistocene was first raised by Russell Ciochon in 2009, though he still considered &quot;Meganthropus&quot; conspecific with &quot;H. erectus&quot;. A detailed analysis of tooth morphology published in 2019 found that it is a valid distinct genus of non-hominin hominid ape, distinguished from the contemporaneous &quot;Pongo&quot; and &quot;Homo&quot; by numerous characters, and again being most similar to &quot;Lufengpithecus&quot;, thus satisfying the criteria for the &quot;mystery ape&quot;. &quot;&quot;Pithecanthropus dubius&quot;&quot; was found to be a junior synonym.

<text>The Oldowan (or Mode I) was a widespread stone tool archaeological industry (style) in prehistory. These early tools were simple, usually made by chipping one, or a few, flakes off a stone using another stone. Oldowan tools were used during the Lower Paleolithic period, 2.9 million years ago up until at least 1.7 million years ago (Ma), by ancient Hominins (early humans) across much of Africa. This technological industry was followed by the more sophisticated Acheulean industry (two sites associated with &quot;Homo erectus&quot; at Gona in the Afar Region of Ethiopia dating from 1.5 and 1.26 million years ago have both Oldowan and Acheulean tools).

The term &quot;Oldowan&quot; is taken from the site of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where the first Oldowan stone tools were discovered by the archaeologist Louis Leakey in the 1930s. However, some contemporary archaeologists and palaeoanthropologists prefer to use the term &quot;Mode 1&quot; tools to designate pebble tool industries (including Oldowan), with &quot;Mode 2&quot; designating bifacially worked tools (including Acheulean handaxes), &quot;Mode 3&quot; designating prepared-core tools, and so forth.

Classification of Oldowan tools is still somewhat contentious. Mary Leakey was the first to create a system to classify Oldowan assemblages, and built her system based on prescribed use. The system included choppers, scrapers, and pounders. However, more recent classifications of Oldowan assemblages have been made that focus primarily on manufacture due to the problematic nature of assuming use from stone artefacts. An example is Isaac et al.&#x27;s tri-modal categories of &quot;Flaked Pieces&quot; (cores/choppers), &quot;Detached Pieces&quot; (flakes and fragments), &quot;Pounded Pieces&quot; (cobbles utilized as hammerstones, etc.) and &quot;Unmodified Pieces&quot; (manuports, stones transported to sites). Oldowan tools are sometimes called &quot;pebble tools&quot;, so named because the blanks chosen for their production already resemble, in pebble form, the final product.

It is not known for sure which hominin species created and used Oldowan tools. Its emergence is often associated with the species &quot;Australopithecus garhi&quot; and its flourishing with early species of &quot;Homo&quot; such as &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. ergaster&quot;. Early &quot;Homo erectus&quot; appears to inherit Oldowan technology and refines it into the Acheulean industry beginning 1.7 million years ago.

==Dates and ranges==

The oldest known Oldowan tools have been found at Nyayanga on the Homa Peninsula in Kenya and are dated to ~2.9 million years ago (Ma). The Oldowan tools were associated with &quot;Paranthropus&quot; teeth and two butchered hippo skeletons. Early Oldowan tools are also known from Gona in Ethiopia (near the Awash River), and are dated to about 2.6 Ma.

The use of tools by apes including chimpanzees and orangutans can be used to argue in favour of tool-use as an ancestral feature of the hominin family. Tools made from bone, wood, or other organic materials were therefore in all probability used before the Oldowan. Oldowan stone tools are simply the oldest recognisable tools which have been preserved in the archaeological record.

There is a flourishing of Oldowan tools in eastern Africa, spreading to southern Africa, between 2.4 and 1.7 Ma. At 1.7 Ma., the first Acheulean tools appear even as Oldowan assemblages continue to be produced. Both technologies are occasionally found in the same areas, dating to the same time periods. This realisation required a rethinking of old cultural sequences in which the more &quot;advanced&quot; Acheulean was supposed to have succeeded the Oldowan. The different traditions may have been used by different species of hominins living in the same area, or multiple techniques may have been used by an individual species in response to different circumstances.

Sometime before 1.8 Ma &quot;Homo erectus&quot; had spread outside of Africa, reaching as far east as Java by 1.8 Ma and in Northern China by 1.66 Ma. In these newly colonised areas, no Acheulean assemblages have been found. In China, only &quot;Mode 1&quot; Oldowan assemblages were produced, while in Indonesia stone tools from this age are unknown.

By 1.8 Ma early &quot;Homo&quot; was present in Europe, as shown by the discovery of fossil remains and Oldowan tools in Dmanisi, Georgia. Remains of their activities have also been excavated in Spain at sites in the Guadix-Baza basin and near Atapuerca. Most early European sites yield &quot;Mode 1&quot; or Oldowan assemblages. The earliest Acheulean sites in Europe only appear around 0.5 Ma. In addition, the Acheulean tradition does not seem to spread to Eastern Asia. It is unclear from the archaeological record when the production of Oldowan technologies ended. Other tool-making traditions seem to have supplanted Oldowan technologies by 0.25 Ma.

The discovery of stone tools that predate the Oldowan, dated to as early as 3.3 Ma, at the Lomekwi site in Kenya, was announced in 2015.

This age pre-dates the current estimates for the age of the genus &quot;Homo&quot; by half a million years, and would fall into the pre-human period, 
associated with the direct australopithecine ancestors of genus &quot;Homo&quot;. It is not clear whether the tools of such a &quot;Lomekwian industry&quot; bear any relation to the Oldowan industry.

==Tools==
===Manufacture===

There are articles that address how some Oldowan tools may have been found as stones with naturally occurring shapes that dictate their ideal use, or formed as such. To form the general shape of an Oldowan tool, a roughly spherical hammerstone is struck on the edge, or striking platform, of a suitable core rock to produce a conchoidal fracture with sharp edges useful for various purposes. The process is often called lithic reduction. The chip removed by the blow is the flake. Some of these flakes can be used as tools, provided the aforementioned conditions for the initial stone are met before modification. Below the point of impact on the core is a characteristic bulb with fine fissures on the fracture surface. The flake evidences ripple marks.

The materials of the tools were for the most part quartz, quartzite, basalt, or obsidian, and later flint and chert. Any rock that can hold an edge will do. The main source of these rocks is river cobbles, which provide both hammer stones and striking platforms. The earliest tools were simply split cobbles. It is not always clear which is the flake. Later tool-makers clearly identified and reworked flakes. Complaints that artifacts could not be distinguished from naturally fractured stone have helped spark careful studies of Oldowan techniques. These techniques have now been duplicated many times by archaeologists and other knappers, making misidentification of archaeological finds less likely.

Use of bone tools by hominins also producing Oldowan tools is known from Swartkrans, where a bone shaft with a polished point was discovered in Member (layer) I, dated 1.8–1.5 Ma. The Osteodontokeratic industry, the &quot;bone-tooth-horn&quot; industry hypothesized by Raymond Dart, is less certain.

===Shapes and uses===

Mary Leakey classified the Oldowan tools as Heavy Duty, Light Duty, Utilized Pieces and Debitage, or waste. Heavy-duty tools are mainly cores. A chopper has an edge on one side. It is unifacial if the edge was created by flaking on one face of the core, or bifacial if on two. Discoid tools are roughly circular with a peripheral edge. Polyhedral tools are edged in the shape of a polyhedron. In addition there are spheroidal hammer stones. 

Light-duty tools are mainly flakes. There are scrapers, awls (with points for boring) and burins (with points for engraving). Some of these functions belong also to heavy-duty tools. For example, there are heavy-duty scrapers.

Utilized pieces are tools that began with one purpose in mind but were utilized opportunistically. Because of their use and variation, opportunities lead to the frequent modification of tools for either labor or forms of signaling has been proposed as a cause for the different shapes of similar tools.

Oldowan tools were probably used for many purposes, which have been discovered from observation of modern apes and hunter-gatherers. Nuts and bones are cracked by hitting them with hammer stones on a stone used as an anvil. Battered and pitted stones testify to this possible use.

Heavy-duty tools could be used as axes for woodworking. Once a branch was separated, it could be scraped clean with a scraper, or hollowed with pointed tools. Such uses are attested by characteristic microscopic alterations of edges used to scrape wood. Oldowan tools could also have been used for preparing hides. Hides must be cut by slicing, piercing and scraping them clean of residues. Flakes are most suitable for this purpose.

Lawrence Keeley, following in the footsteps of Sergei Semenov, conducted microscopic studies (with a high-powered optical microscope) on the edges of tools manufactured &quot;de novo&quot; and used for the originally speculative purposes described above. He found that the marks were characteristic of the use and matched marks on prehistoric tools. Studies of the cut marks on bones using an electron microscope produce a similar result.

===Abbevillian===
Abbevillian is a currently obsolescent name for a tool tradition that is increasingly coming to be called Oldowan. The label Abbevillian prevailed until the Leakey family discovered older (yet similar) artifacts at Olduvai Gorge and promoted the African origin of man. Oldowan soon replaced Abbevillian in describing African and Asian lithics. The term Abbevillian is still used but is now restricted to Europe. The label, however, continues to lose popularity as a scientific designation.

In the late 20th century, discovery of the discrepancies in date caused a crisis of definition. Because Abbevillian did not necessarily precede Acheulean and both traditions had flakes and bifaces, it became difficult to differentiate the two. It was in this spirit that many artifacts formerly considered Abbevillian were labeled Acheulean. In consideration of the difficulty, some preferred to name both phases Acheulean. When the topic of Abbevillian came up, it was simply put down as a phase of Acheulean. Whatever was from Africa was Oldowan, and whatever from Europe, Acheulean.

The solution to the definition problem is to define the types in terms of complexity. Simply struck tools are Oldowan. Retouched, or reworked tools are Acheulean. Retouching is a second working of the artifact. The manufacturer first creates an Oldowan tool. Then he reworks or retouches the edges by removing very small chips so as to straighten and sharpen the edge. Typically but not necessarily the reworking is accomplished by pressure flaking.

==Tool users==
While the exact hominid is up for debate, it is believed that some of the first Oldowan makers did fall within the &quot;Homo&quot; line. However, fossil evidence showed evolutionary features for human precision grip capabilities in Australopithecines. This leads to current anthropological thinking in which Oldowan tools were made by late &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and early &quot;Homo&quot;. &quot;Homo habilis&quot; was named &quot;skillful&quot; because it was considered the earliest tool-using human ancestor.
Indeed, the genus &quot;Homo&quot; was in origin intended to separate tool-using species from their tool-less predecessors, hence the name of &quot;Australopithecus garhi&quot;, &quot;garhi&quot; meaning &quot;surprise&quot;, a tool-using Australopithecine discovered in 1996 and described as the &quot;missing link&quot; between the genera &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Homo&quot;. There is also evidence that some species of &quot;Paranthropus&quot; utilized stone tools.

There is presently no evidence to show that Oldowan tools were the sole creation of members of the &quot;Homo&quot; line or that the ability to produce them was a special characteristic of only our ancestors. Research on tool use by modern wild chimpanzees in West Africa shows there is an operational sequence when chimpanzees use lithic implements to crack nuts. In the course of nut cracking, sometimes they will create unintentional flakes. Although the morphology of the chimpanzees&#x27; hammer is different from the Oldowan hammer, chimpanzees&#x27; ability to use stone tools indicates that the earliest lithic industries were probably not produced by only one kind of hominin species.

Findings from fossil evidence and experimental replication of stone-tool users and manufacturers suggest the presence of physical characteristics of hand morphology for precise stone tool making. The makers of Oldowan tools were mainly right-handed. &quot;Handedness&quot; (lateralization) had thus already evolved, though it is not clear how related to modern lateralization it was, since other animals show handedness as well.

In the mid-1970s, Glynn Isaac touched off a debate by proposing that human ancestors of this period had a &quot;place of origin&quot; and that they foraged outward from this home base, returning with high-quality food to share and to be processed. Over the course of the last 30 years, a variety of competing theories about how foraging occurred have been proposed, each one implying certain kinds of social strategy. The available evidence from the distribution of tools and remains is not enough to decide which theories are the most probable. However, three main groups of theories predominate.
* Glynn Isaac&#x27;s model became the Central Forage Point, as he responded to critics that accused him of attributing too much &quot;modern&quot; behavior to early hominins with relatively free-form searches outward.
* A second group of models took modern chimpanzee behavior as a starting point, having the hominids use relatively fixed routes of foraging, and leaving tools where it was best to do so on a constant track.
* A third group of theories had relatively loose bands scouring the range, taking care to move carcasses from dangerous death sites and leaving tools more or less at random.

Each group of models implies different grouping and social strategies, from the relative altruism of central base models to the relatively disjointed search models. (See also central foraging theory and Lewis Binford.)

Hominins probably lived in social groups that had contact with others. This conclusion is supported by the large number of bones at many sites, too large to be the work of one individual, and all of the scatter patterns implying many different individuals. Since modern primates in Africa have fluid boundaries between groups, as individuals enter, become the focus of bands, and others leave, it is also probable that the tools we find are the result of many overlapping groups working the same territories, and perhaps competing over them. Because of the huge expanse of time and the multiplicity of species associated with possible Oldowan tools, it is difficult to be more precise than this, since it is almost certain that different social groupings were used at different times and in different places.

There is also the question of what mix of hunting, gathering and scavenging the tool users employed. Early models focused on the tool users as hunters. The animals butchered by the tools include waterbuck, hartebeest, springbok, pig and zebra. However, the disposition of the bones allows some question about hominin methods of obtaining meat. That they were omnivores is unquestioned, as the digging implement and the probable use of hammer stones to smash nuts indicate. Lewis Binford first noticed that the bones at Olduvai contained a disproportionately high incidence of extremities, which are low in food substance. He concluded other predators had taken the best meat, and the hominins had only scavenged. The counter view is that while hunting many large animals would be beyond the reach of an individual human, groups could bring down larger game, as pack hunting animals are capable of doing. Moreover, since many animals both hunt and scavenge, it is possible that hominins hunted smaller animals, but were not above driving carnivores from larger kills, as they probably were driven from kills themselves from time to time.

==Sites and archaeologists==

A complete catalog of Oldowan sites would be too extensive for listing here. Some of the better-known sites include the following:

===Africa===

====Ethiopia====

=====Afar Triangle=====

Sites in the Gona river system in the Hadar region of the Afar triangle, excavated by Helene Roche, J. W. Harris and Sileshi Semaw, yielded some of the oldest known Oldowan assemblages, dating to about 2.6 million years ago. Raw material analysis done by Semaw showed that some assemblages in this region are biased towards a certain material (e.g.: 70% of the artifacts at sites EG10 and EG12 were composed of trachyte) indicating a selectivity in the quality of stone used. Recent excavations have yielded tools in association with cut-marked bones, indicating that Oldowan were used in meat-processing or -acquiring activities.

=====Omo River basin=====

The second oldest known Oldowan tool site comes from the Shungura formation of the Omo River basin. This formation documents the sediments of the Plio-Pleistocene and provides a record of the hominins that lived there. Lithic assemblages have been classified as Oldowan in members E and F in the lower Omo basin. Although there have been lithic assemblages found in multiple sites in these areas, only the Omo sites 57 and 123 in member F are accepted as hominin lithic remains. The assemblages at Omo sites 71 and 84 in member E do not show evidence of hominin modification and are therefore classified as natural assemblages.

The tools are never found in direct association with the hominins, but archaeologists believe that they would be the strongest candidates for tool manufacture. There are no hominins in those layers, but the same layers elsewhere in the Omo valley contain &quot;Paranthropus&quot; and early &quot;Homo&quot; fossils. &quot;Paranthropus&quot; occurs in the preceding layers. In the last layer at 1.4 million years ago is only &quot;Homo erectus&quot;.

====Egypt====

Along the Nile River, within the 100-foot terrace, evidence of Chellean or Oldowan cultures has been found.

====Algeria====

In November 2018 &quot;Science&quot; published a report of Oldowan artefacts in a secure dating context of 1.9 to 2.4 Ma from Ain Boucherit (Ain Hanech) in Setif.

====Kenya====

=====Homa Peninsula=====

Kanjera South, part of the Kanjera site complex, and Nyayanga are located on the Homa Peninsula. Kanjera South is estimated to around 2 Ma. while Nyayanga is estimated to 2.9 Ma. One of the significant excavations, in the area, is Leakey&#x27;s expedition in 1932-35. In 1995, Oldowan and Plio-Pleistocene faunal remains surfaced from the site. and in 2015 excavations led to the discovery of the earliest Oldowan stone tool technology in association with &quot;Paranthropus&quot; fossils and butchered hippo remains from Nyayanga.

=====East Turkana=====

The numerous Koobi Fora sites on the east side of Lake Turkana are now part of Sibiloi National Park. Sites were initially excavated by Richard Leakey, Meave Leakey, Jack Harris, Glynn Isaac and others. Currently the artifacts found are classified as Oldowan or KBS Oldowan dated from 1.9–1.7 Ma, Karari (or &quot;advanced Oldowan&quot;) dated to 1.6–1.4 Ma, and some early Acheulean at the end of the Karari. Over 200 hominins have been found, including &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Homo&quot;.

===== West Turkana =====
In the Nachukui site in West Turkana, around 500 stone tools were found at a site named Naiyena Engol 2, or NY2. The assemblage at NY2 dates back to 1.8–1.7 Ma, around the peak of the Oldowan period. At the site, freehand flaking was observed to be the most common type of technique for making these tools. A common theme among sites in West Turkana is the high percentage of small flake tools gathered in the assemblages. However, NY2 seems to lack many of these tools, indicating a low productivity rate of flakes.

=====Kilombe=====

Acheulian stone tools have been known about at Kilombe Main site in the central rift of Kenya since the 1970s with excavations by John Gowlett for his PhD. More recently, Oldowan technology has also been discovered in Kilombe Caldera in an unusual high altitude setting. The stone tools are associated with fossils and have been dated to 1.8 Ma, with Acheulian stone tools occurring in overlying levels.

====Tanzania====

=====Olduvai Gorge=====

The Oldowan industry is named after discoveries made in the Olduvai Gorge of Tanzania in east Africa by the Leakey family, primarily Mary Leakey, but also her husband Louis and their son, Richard. Mary Leakey organized a typology of Early Pleistocene stone tools, which developed Oldowan tools into three chronological variants, A, B and C. Developed Oldowan B is of particular interest due to changes in morphology that appear to have been driven mostly by the short term availability of a chert resource from 1.65 to 1.53 Ma. The flaking properties of this new resource resulted in considerably more core reduction and a higher prevalence of flake retouch. Similar tools had already been found in various locations in Europe and Asia for some time, where they were called Chellean and Abbevillian.

The oldest tool sites are in the East African Rift system, on the sediments of ancient streams and lakes. This is consistent with what we surmise of the evolution of man.

====South Africa====

Abbé Breuil was the first recognized archaeologist to go on record to assert the existence of Oldowan tools. While his description was for &quot;Chello-Abbevillean&quot; tools, and post-dated Leakey&#x27;s finds at Olduvai Gorge by at least ten years, his descriptions nonetheless represented the scholarly acceptance of this technology as legitimate. These findings were cited as being from the location of the Vaal River, at Vereeniging, and Breuil noted the distinct absence of a significant number of cores, suggesting a &quot;portable culture&quot;. At the time, this was considered very significant, as portability supported the conclusion that the Oldowan tool-makers were capable of planning for future needs, by creating the tools in a location which was distant from their use.

=====Swartkrans=====

The Swartkrans site is a cave filled with layered fossil-bearing limestone deposits. Oldowan is found in Member 1 Lower Bank at 2.2-1.8 Ma in association with &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot; and a single fossil attributed to &quot;Homo&quot; . The Member I assemblage also includes a shaft of pointed bone polished at the pointed end. Member I contained a high percentage of primate remains compared to other animal remains, which did not fit the hypothesis that &quot;H. habilis&quot; or &quot;P. robustus&quot; lived in the cave. C. K. Brain conducted a more detailed study and discovered the cave had been the abode of leopards, who preyed on the hominins.

=====Sterkfontein=====

Another site of limestone caves is Sterkfontein, found in South Africa. This site contains a large number of not only Oldowan tools, but also early Acheulean technology.
Drimolen

The cave site of Drimolen has yielded 6 stone tools attributed to the Oldowan as well as 65 bone tools, along with specimens of &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot; and &quot;Homo erectus&quot; 

===Europe===

====Georgia====

In 1999 and 2002, two &quot;Homo erectus&quot; skulls (&quot;H. georgicus&quot;) were discovered at Dmanisi in southern Georgia. The archaeological layer in which the human remains, hundreds of Oldowan stone tools, and numerous animal bones were unearthed is dated approximately 1.83-1.6 Ma. The site yields the earliest unequivocal evidence for presence of early humans outside the African continent.

====Bulgaria====

At Kozarnika, in the ground layers, dated to 1.6-1.4 Ma, archaeologists have discovered a human molar tooth, lower palaeolithic assemblages that belong to a core-and-flake non-Acheulian industry and incised bones that may be the earliest example of human symbolic behaviour.

====Russia====
 and Muhkay-2 (North Caucasus, Daghestan) are the extraordinary sites in relation to date and the culture. Geological and geomorphological data, palynological studies and paleomagnetic testing unequivocally point to Early Pleistocene (Eopleistocene), indicating the age of the sites as being within the range of 1.8 – 1.2 Ma.

====Spain====

Oldowan tools have been found at the following sites: Fuente Nueva 3, Barranco del Leon, Sima del Elefante, Atapuerca TD 6.

====France====

Oldowan tools have been found at: Lézignan-la-Cèbe, 1.5 Ma; Abbeville, 1–0.5 Ma; Vallonnet cave, French Riviera; Soleihac, open-air site in Massif Central. Oldowan tools have also been found at Tautavel in the foothills of the Pyrenees. These were discovered by Henry de Lumbley alongside human remains (cranium). The tools are of limestone and quartz.

====Elsewhere====

Oldowan tools have been found in Italy at the Monte Poggiolo open air site dated to approximately 850 ka, making them the oldest evidence of human habitation in Italy. In Germany tools have been found in river gravels at Kärlich dating from 300 ka. In the Czech Republic tools have been found in ancient lake deposits at Przeletice and a cave site at Stranska Skala, dated no later than 500 ka. In Hungary tools have been found at a spring site at Vértesszőlős dating from 500 ka.

===Asia===

==== China ====
At the Xihoudu site in China, 32 stone tools were found, including choppers, scrapers, and 3-edged tools. These tools were dated back to 1.8 Ma. This site also included cultural artifacts, such as animal fossils, burnt bones, and cut antlers. The presence of numerous fish and beaver fossils near the stone tools indicate the existence of a body of water at the site.

==== Pakistan ====
In Pakistan, Oldowan tools have been found at Riwat during a 1980s excavation. Many of the stones found at this site were considered waste products of stone tool production, as they were small flakes chipped off of larger stones. In total, 1,479 tools and flakes were discovered at this site.

==== Syria ====
An excavated site at El Kowm (Aïn al Fil, (:de:Aïn al Fil)), Syria revealed a plethora of Oldowan tools. In a 2m2 test pit excavated in 2008, 790 artifacts were found, with many pebble tools, cores, flakes, manuports, and flake debris. Although many of these tools show little sign of modification, several of the pebble tools are distinctly-shaped bifacial and trifacial choppers. Dated between 2.0-1.8 Ma, these stone tools are some of the earliest Near East finds.

Because of their location in the Syrian desert, these tools have raised questions about the path of early hominin dispersal. The predominant theory that early hominins traveled along the Mediterranean, through what is now Israel, into Europe has been challenged, as the presence of these Oldowan tools indicate that an alternate route may have been taken. 

==== Iran ====
In Iran, 80 tools of different assemblages have been discovered at 7 sites in the Kashafrud Basin. Although many of the artifacts found here, dated at 1.8 Ma, were pre-Acheulean, some are of the Oldowan tradition, resembling East African Oldowan finds. Containing cores, choppers, flake, chunks, and hammer stones made predominately of quartz, this site displayed the ability of early toolmakers to work skillfully with fragile stones.

==== Israel ====
The site at Bizat Ruhama (near kibbutz Ruhama) has shown evidence that the complexity of the stone tool-making process was more complex than researchers previously thought, leading to a new perspective on the capabilities of invention and adaptability of Oldowan hominin populations.

Another key find at the Bizat Ruhama site was that of the secondary flakes. The discovery of these secondary flakes have led researchers to believe that this was an intentional response to a raw material constraint.

According to the micro-morphological studies at the Bizat Ruhama site, the archaeological assemblages represent one or several occupations of the site in a relatively short time frame.

<doc id="445569" wikidata="Q1058501" url="?curid=445569" title="Sun Belt">
<text>The Sun Belt is a region of the United States generally considered stretching across the Southeast and Southwest. Another rough definition of the region is the area south of the Parallel 36°30′ north. Several climates can be found in the region—desert/semi-desert (Eastern California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and West Texas), Mediterranean (California), humid subtropical (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas), and tropical (South Florida).

The Sun Belt has seen substantial population growth post-World War II from an influx of people seeking a warm and sunny climate, a surge in retiring baby boomers, and growing economic opportunities. The advent of air conditioning created more comfortable summer conditions and allowed more manufacturing and industry to locate in the Sun Belt. Since much of the construction in the Sun Belt is new or recent, housing styles and design are often modern and open. Recreational opportunities in the Sun Belt are often not tied strictly to one season, and many tourist and resort cities in the region support a tourist industry all year.

==Migration==
Out of the 15 fastest-growing cities in the U.S., 12 are located in the Sun Belt as of 2023. Additionally, 86 percent of the top 50 zip codes that saw the largest increases in new residents since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were in Texas, Florida, and Arizona. The traditional explanations for the growth are increasing productivity in the South and West and increasing demand for Sun Belt amenities, especially its pleasant weather. Job decline in the Rust Belt is another major reason for migration.

==Definition==
The Sun Belt comprises the southern tier of the U.S., including the states of Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina, Texas, roughly two-thirds of California (up to Greater Sacramento), and the southern parts of Arkansas, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Utah. Five of the states—Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada, and Texas—are sometimes collectively called the Sand States because of their abundance of beaches and/or deserts. Other definitions may also include parts of Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and Virginia and most or all of Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Tennessee. For example, the Kinder Institute for Urban Research defines the Sun Belt as being south of 36°30′N latitude, which includes all of Arkansas, most of Oklahoma and virtually all of Tennessee (small parts of East and Middle Tennessee extend north of 36°30′ due to surveying errors) but leaves out most of Nevada and California, with only Southern California and parts of Nye County and the Las Vegas Valley being included. This definition also includes most of the Missouri Bootheel.

First employed by political analyst Kevin Phillips in his 1969 book &quot;The Emerging Republican Majority&quot;, the term &quot;Sun Belt&quot; became synonymous with the southern third of the nation in the early 1970s. In this period, economic and political prominence shifted from the Midwest and Northeast to the South and West. Factors such as the warmer climate, the migration of workers from Mexico, and a boom in the agriculture industry allowed the southern third of the United States to grow economically. The climate spurred not only agricultural growth, but also the migration of many retirees to retirement communities in the region, especially in Florida and Arizona.

Industries such as aerospace, defense, and oil boomed in the Sun Belt as companies took advantage of the low involvement of labor unions in the region (due to more recent industrialization, 1930s–1950s) and the proximity of military installations that were major consumers of their products. The oil industry helped propel states such as Texas and Louisiana forward, and tourism grew in Florida, and Southern California. More recently, high tech and new economy industries have been major drivers of growth in California, Florida, Texas, and other parts of the Sun Belt. Texas and California rank among the top five states in the nation with the most &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies.

==Projections==
In 2005, the U.S. Census Bureau projected that approximately 88% of the nation&#x27;s population growth between 2000 and 2030 would occur in the Sun Belt. California, Texas, and Florida were each expected to add more than 12 million people during that time, which would make them by far the most populous states in America. Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, and Texas were expected to be the fastest-growing states.

Events leading up to and including the 2008–2009 recession led some to question whether growth projections for the Sun Belt had been overstated. The economic bubble that led to the recession appeared, to some observers, to have been more acute in the Sun Belt than other parts of the country. Additionally, the traditional lure of cheaper labor markets in the region compared with America&#x27;s older industrial centers has been eroded by overseas outsourcing trends.

One of the greatest threats facing the belt in the coming decades is water shortages. Communities in California are making plans to build multiple desalination plants to supply fresh water and avert near-term crises. Texas, Georgia, and Florida also face increasingly serious shortages because of their rapidly expanding populations and high per-capita water consumption.

Lingering effects from the Great Recession slowed, and in some places even stopped, the migration from the Frost Belt to the Sun Belt, according to data tracking people&#x27;s movements over the year from July 2012 – 2013. Americans remained cautious about moving to a different state over this period. However, migration to the Sun Belt from the Frost Belt resumed again, according to 2015 Census data estimates, with growing migration to the Sun Belt and out of the Frost Belt.

==Politics==
The Sun Belt has historically been more conservative than the nation at large, especially in comparison to regions such as New England, the Pacific Northwest, and to a somewhat lesser extent, the Mid-Atlantic states and the Rust Belt. This has been attributed in part to the high percentage of evangelical Christians living in the region.

Increasing racial diversity and political realignment on urban/rural lines have made some Sun Belt states more competitive, though all states in the region excluding New Mexico and California continue to vote to the right of the national average.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden narrowly won the states of Arizona and Georgia in the presidential election, and the party gained seats in both states in the Senate elections. In the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump won the swing states of Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada, and Georgia.

==Environment==
The environment in the belt is extremely valuable, not only to local and state governments, but to the federal government. Eight of the ten states have extremely high biodiversity (ranging from 3,800 to 6,700 species, not including marine life). The Sun Belt also has the highest number of distinct ecosystems: chaparral, deciduous, desert, grasslands, temperate rainforest, and tropical rainforest.

Some endangered species live within the belt, including:

* American crocodile
* Black-capped vireo
* California condor
* Florida panther
* Fraser fir
* Longleaf pine
* Mexican wolf
* Red-cockaded woodpecker
* Red Hills salamander
* Sonoran pronghorn
* West Indian manatee
* Whooping crane

==Major cities==

The five largest metropolitan statistical areas are Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Miami. The Los Angeles area is by far the largest, with over 13 million inhabitants . The ten largest metropolitan statistical areas are found in California, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona. Additionally, the cross-border metropolitan areas of San Diego-Tijuana and El Paso–Juárez lie partially within the Sun Belt. Seven of the ten largest cities in the U.S. are located in the Sun Belt: Los Angeles (2), Houston (4), Phoenix (6), San Antonio (7), San Diego (8), Dallas (9), and San Jose (10). Los Angeles County has a veteran population of 270,462.

<text>Kiryat Arba or Qiryat Arba () is an urban Israeli settlement on the outskirts of Hebron, in the southern Israeli-occupied West Bank. Founded in 1968, in it had a population of .

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.

==Etymology==
The modern settlement derives its name from a Kiryat Arba mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the former name of Hebron and as the place where Abraham&#x27;s wife, Sarah, has died: &quot;And Sarah died at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron)&quot; (). The Book of Joshua says: &quot;Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba; this Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.&quot; (). It is also one of the places listed in Nehemiah where some of the people of Judah were living. There is no reference to Hebron in Nehemiah, however.

There are various explanations for the name, not mutually exclusive. According to the biblical commentator Rashi, &quot;Kiryat Arba&quot; (&quot;Town of &quot;Arba&quot;&quot;) means either the town (&quot;kirya&quot;) of Arba, the giant who had three sons, or the town of the four giants: &quot;Anak&quot; (the son of Arba) and his three sons – Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai – who are described as being the sons of a &quot;giant&quot; in : &quot;On the way through the Negev, they (Joshua and Caleb) came to Hebron where [they saw] Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmi, descendants of the Giant (&quot;ha-anak&quot;)...&quot;

==History ==

A secret government plan to establish the settlement began with the expropriation of Palestinian land, ostensibly for a military base. According to the minutes of a meeting between senior officials in the office of Defense Minister Moshe Dayan in July 1970, houses would be constructed &quot;for military purposes&quot; before being turned over to Israeli civilians as a settlement. This method of settlement foundation, which was very common at the time, was intended to give the appearance of compliance with international law. Israeli settlers claimed that Israeli settlement around Hebron was justified in light of the 1929 Hebron massacre and the continuous presence of Israelis in the area until then. The town is a self-sufficient community, with pre-nursery through post-secondary educational institutions, medical facilities, shopping centers, a bank, and a post office. Kiryat Arba attained local council status in 1979. While Kiryat Arba is located within the territory of the Har Hebron Regional Council, it is an independent local council.

Israeli settlers living at Kiryat Arba have been targets of multiple attacks by Palestinians. In 1980, three 20-year-old yeshiva students studying in Kiryat Arba were among the six Jews killed by terrorists after praying in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron on Friday night. Between 1981 and 1986, four people from Kiryat Arba were shot and wounded in the Hebron marketplace. In 1994, a 17-year Sarit Prigral from Kiryat Arba was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting. In March 2003, Eli and Dina Horowitz were shot to death in their home and five others wounded. On November 26, 2009, a Palestinian stabbed and wounded two Israelis at a Kiryat Arba gas station. The Palestinian was then shot dead by an Israeli soldier. On August 31, 2010, four residents, including a pregnant woman, were shot to death in their car by Hamas militants outside Kiryat Arba. The Palestinian Authority arrested the perpetrators, but promptly released them after Hamas accused it of treason. On October 8, 2010, Israeli troops killed two of the perpetrators and arrested six during a raid in Hebron. In October 2011, a Palestinian stoning attack near Kiryat Arba caused the car of a resident to overturn, killing him and his infant son. The man&#x27;s handgun and wallet were then stolen. Following an investigation by Shin Bet, the IDF and police, two Palestinians from Halhul were arrested for throwing the stones that caused the car to overturn, and three others were arrested for stealing the gun. On June 30, 2016, a Palestinian from the nearby village of Bani Naim entered a house in Kiryat Arba and stabbed to death 13-year-old Hallel Yaffa Ariel, an Israeli-American girl. The attacker was shot to death, after also wounding a security guard who responded to the Ariel stabbing.

In October 2018, Eliyahu Libman was elected council head beating Malachi Levinger, the son of Moshe Levinger, who had served as head of council for 10 years.

<text>Stonewall Equality Limited, trading as Stonewall, is a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBTQ) rights charity in the United Kingdom. It is the largest LGBT rights organisation in Europe.

Named after the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, Stonewall was formed in 1989 by political activists and others campaigning against Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, including Ian McKellen, Lisa Power, and Michael Cashman. Stonewall diversified into policy development after Labour came to power in 1997, a period which saw successful campaigns to: repeal Section 28, end the ban on LGBT people in the armed forces, equalise the age of consent, extend adoption and IVF rights to same-sex couples, and introduce civil partnerships.

==History==
Stonewall was formed on 24 May 1989, in response to Section 28 of the Local Government Act. Its founding members and trustees were:
Originally named The Stonewall Lobby Group Ltd, the organisation changed its name to Stonewall Equality Ltd on 16 March 2004.

===Repeal of LGBT military ban (2000)===
One of Stonewall&#x27;s first and longest campaigns challenged the ban on lesbians and gay men serving in the armed forces, a campaign finally won in 1999. Though the law banning homosexuality in the armed forces was not repealed until the 2016 Armed Forces Act, the internal policy was changed in 2000. The campaign began when Robert Ely, who had served in the British Army for 17 years, and former Army Nurse Elaine Chambers approached Stonewall. The discovery of a letter had led to Ely&#x27;s sexual orientation being disclosed and he was subjected to an investigation and discharged from the army.

In 1998, Stonewall was approached by Jeanette Smith, who had been discharged from the Royal Air Force, and Duncan Lustig Prean, a Royal Navy commander who was being so discharged from the Navy. They asked Stonewall to arrange legal representation, leading to a long battle through the courts with Graham Grady and John Beckett also joining the case. The case pre-dated the Human Rights Act 1998. Although the judges in the High Court and Court of Appeal said that they felt the ban was not justified they could not overturn it and the individuals had to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights where they were successful. The judgment of the court was a vindication of the rights of lesbians and gay men and the New Labour government of the time immediately announced that the ban would be lifted. This took effect on 12 January 2000, and a new general code of sexual conduct was introduced.

In 2004 the Armed Forces hosted their first LGBTQ Conference at the Military Chaplaincy, at Amport House near Andover. Over 50 servicemen and women attended. In 2005, the Royal Navy, followed by the Royal Air Force in 2006 and the British Army in 2008, joined Stonewall&#x27;s Diversity Champions programme, which promotes good working conditions and equal treatment for LGBT servicemembers.

In February 2005, the Royal Navy joined Stonewall&#x27;s Diversity Champions programme, the Royal Air Force and the British Army, the largest of the three services in June 2008. The number of major employers involved in the programme grew from 100 members in 2005 to over 600 in 2010. Organisations now engaged in the programme, between them employing over four million people include many UK universities health trusts banks and financial institutions.
===Diversity Champions programme (2001)===
In 2001, Stonewall launched its Diversity Champions programme, a programme which works with over 900 organisations to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people (the LGBTQ+ community) are comfortable in the workplace. This includes addressing outright discrimination, as well as &quot;more discrete&quot; forms of heterosexist thinking.

Employers who pay to join the scheme are given a logo to use on promotional materials and are listed on a &#x27;Proud Employers&#x27; careers site. They gain access to a library of resources and may have their policies reviewed for LGBT inclusivity by Stonewall staff. Members of the scheme are given advice on words and phrases used in their staff support materials, including a preference for gender-neutral language.

===2000 - 2010===

Under Angela Mason, Stonewall became the most influential LGBT lobbying organisation in Britain. Mason&#x27;s tenure saw Stonewall support legal test cases in the European Court of Human Rights which included:
*Chris Morris and Euan Sutherland, who in Sutherland v United Kingdom successfully challenged the unequal age of consent laws.
*Duncan Lustig-Prean and John Beckett, who successfully challenged the ban on gay people in the armed forces. 
*Lisa Grant, who (unsuccessfully) sued her employer, South West Trains, for equal pay and benefits.
Legislative achievements in this period or arising from Mason&#x27;s work include:
* amendments to the 2002 Adoption and Children Bill, which treated lesbian and gay couples in the same way as heterosexuals.
* Equalisation of the age of consent to 16 years old, as part of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, after the use of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, in November 2000.
* repeal of Clause 2a of the Local Government Act in Scotland (2000).
* repeal Section 28 of the Local Government Act in England and Wales (2003).
* recognition of anti-gay hate crimes through the Criminal Justice Act 2003.
* introduction of the Civil Partnership Act 2004, which gave gay and lesbian couples a legal framework equivalent to civil marriage.

Away from the courts and Parliament, Stonewall launched the Diversity Champions programme in 2001. The scheme engaged employers in developing best practice and within 18 months successfully garnered members ranging from major banks, through national retailers to Government departments such as the MoD, Home Office and the Treasury. 
Stonewall gained Lottery funding for the Citizen 21 programme, a three-year project (2000 to 2003) which tackled LGB discrimination in education and developed materials that became widely used in the education sector. An information bank and advice service was also formed as part of the project.

Stonewall was also involved in successful parliamentary campaigns to:
* shape the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations, protections against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in the provision of goods and services secured through the Equality Act 2006.
* equalise treatment of lesbian parents and their children in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008
* introduce an offence of incitement to homophobic hatred in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, matching existing protections around race and religion.

===Same-sex marriage (2010)===
Stonewall under the leadership of Ben Summerskill came under criticism in September 2010, after he made comments at a Liberal Democrat party conference fringe event that Stonewall &quot;expressed and expresses no view&quot; on same-sex marriage and that the equal marriage policy proposed by gay Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams could potentially cost £5 billion. Summerskill&#x27;s comments were criticised by two of Stonewall&#x27;s co-founders: Michael Cashman MEP wrote an op-ed for &quot;PinkNews&quot; entitled &quot;What part of &#x27;equality&#x27; can&#x27;t Stonewall understand?&quot;; and Sir Ian McKellen stated that Stonewall should put marriage equality on their agenda. Summerskill defended his comments at the Labour Party conference a week later after LGBT Labour activists criticised Stonewall&#x27;s lack of transparency and democracy, and failure to lobby for marriage; he stated that &quot;Stonewall has never pretended to be a democratic member organisation. We have never said we speak for all lesbian, gay and bisexual people.&quot; In the face of pressure from the LGBT community, including a PinkNews survey finding that 98% of the LGBT community wanted the right to marry, Stonewall announced in October 2010 their support for same-sex marriage.

In October 2010, Stonewall revised its policy and agreed to support same-sex marriage, stating &quot;Stonewall is pleased to be widening its campaigning objectives to include extending the legal form of marriage to gay people&quot;.

PinkNews reported heavily on the refusal of Stonewall, an LGBTQ+ rights group, to actively campaign for gay marriage prior to October 2010. Stonewall&#x27;s then Chief Executive Ben Summerskill suggested &quot;it would cost a staggering £5 billion to implement&quot;, a figure later seized upon by opponents of same-sex marriage despite its lack of factual basis. The rift came to a head at Liberal Democrats conference in 2010, where Summerskill argued that &quot;there are lots of lesbians who actually don&#x27;t want marriage&quot;. The event was attended by Lynne Featherstone, the minister for equality; Evan Harris, president of Liberal Democrat LGBT+ group DELGA; and Steve Gilbert, the Lib Dem MP, all of whom said they supported same-sex marriage. A poll commissioned by &quot;PinkNews&quot; and answered by more than 800 of their readership found 98% in support of marriage equality, with many comments calling for Summerskill&#x27;s resignation. Stonewall was also criticised by a former founder, Michael Cashman, MEP, over its policy.

Stonewall&#x27;s former position on same-sex marriage came under greater scrutiny in March 2014, two weeks before the first same-sex marriages were to commence; in a BBC Radio 4 programme on same-sex marriage, Summerskill attacked the Liberal Democrats for being &quot;cynical and opportunistic&quot; during their Autumn 2010 conference, highlighting Evan Harris&#x27;s comment that the policy would put &quot;clear blue water between [them] and the Tories&quot;, a position that was criticised by Lynne Featherstone, the Liberal Democrat junior minister responsible for the act, and Peter Tatchell. 

===In the 2010s===
Stonewall&#x27;s work focused on working with organisations to bring equality to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people at home, at school, and at work. Stonewall&#x27;s &quot;Diversity Champions&quot; programme for major employers rose from 100 members to over 650. Organisations engaged in the programme, between them employing over four million people, ranged from Deloitte and American Express in the private sector to the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, British Army and MI5 in the public sector.

In 2005 Stonewall launched an Education for All programme, supported by a coalition of over 70 organisations, to tackle homophobia in schools. Stonewall&#x27;s education work also includes the slogan &#x27;Some people are gay. Get over it!&#x27; which has been seen at schools, on billboards, tube carriages and buses across Britain.

Stonewall has also produced research reports in areas such as homophobic hate crime, lesbian health and homophobia in football.

Stonewall also holds a number of high-profile events, including the Stonewall Equality Dinner, the Stonewall Summer Party and the Brighton Equality Walk.

On the second annual International Asexuality Day, it was announced that Stonewall is launching the UK&#x27;s first asexual rights initiative in partnership with asexual model and activist Yasmin Benoit.
===2014 boycott of Dorchester===
&quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that Stonewall&#x27;s chief executive, Ruth Hunt, has &quot;been criticised for being too timid – for example for not joining a boycott [in May 2014] of the Dorchester hotel, owned by the Sultan of Brunei, who gave approval to Brunei&#x27;s new penal code, which urges death by stoning for same-sex sexual activity&quot;. The charity had attracted much attention when it announced in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that Stonewall would not be joining the wide boycott of the London hotel where it was to hold a gala dinner. The CEO, Ruth Hunt, argued that there was not &quot;a mandate for the boycott&quot; and &quot;We only implement actions that we can calculate will have an impact.&quot;

===General election 2015===
Days before the May 2015 UK general election Stonewall apologised after being criticised for publishing an online campaign graphic which suggested that only the Labour Party substantially supported LGBT equality in its manifesto. Lib Dem Minister Stephen Williams had previously told PinkNews: &quot;I&#x27;m astounded by this grossly misleading graphic.&quot;
===Safe Schools Alliance (2020)===
In 2020, lawyers for a 14-year-old girl and the Safe Schools Alliance made an application for judicial review against the Crown Prosecution Service in respect of its hate crime guidance for schools and its association with the Diversity Champions programme, saying that it was biased in favour of transgender individuals. This was dismissed by the High Court in 2021, with Mr Justice Cavanagh saying: &quot;There is no basis for asserting that the individual prosecutor will be influenced in any way by the CPS&#x27; status as a Diversity Champion.&quot;

=== Withdrawals from the Diversity Champions scheme=== 

In May 2021, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced that it would be withdrawing from the Diversity Champions programme on the grounds that it did not constitute the best value for money. Liz Truss, the Minister for Women and Equalities, suggested that all government departments should withdraw from the scheme. Commentators in the UK press described the controversy as &#x27;toxic&#x27; with each side taking increasingly extremist positions.

A University of Essex internal report following the cancellation of two visiting speakers&#x27; invitations released in May 2021 stated that the Equality Act 2010 only protects individuals who have undergone or intend to undergo gender reassignment, and not gender identity. Some critics of Stonewall stated that this made the organisation&#x27;s advice under the Diversity Champions scheme potentially misleading. In response, Stonewall argued that the advice was based on the EHRC Code of Practice which had been upheld by a court decision earlier that month.

In October 2021 the BBC aired &quot;Nolan Investigates&quot;, a podcast series presented by Stephen Nolan, looking at the influence Stonewall has on public institutions across the UK. The series was viewed by some as an attack by the BBC on Stonewall and by others as an attack on the BBC and the extent to which the corporation itself is influenced by Stonewall.

In November 2021, the BBC withdrew from the scheme. Its Director General Tim Davie said it left for reasons of impartiality and to &quot;minimise the risk of perceived bias&quot;. Stonewall responded that the exit was a result of &quot;organised attacks on workplace inclusion that extend far beyond&quot; the Diversity Champions scheme. By 2021, several organisations like Channel 4, the Ministry of Justice, United Kingdom, Department of Health, Ofcom and Cabinet Office also withdrew from the Diversity Champion scheme.

In December 2021, University College London decided to withdraw from Stonewall programmes, saying its membership of Stonewall&#x27;s programmes could inhibit academic freedom and discussion around sex and gender. Several Scottish universities declined to apply for a ranking in Stonewall&#x27;s equality league table for 2022.

In July 2022 it was reported that the Department for Education had dissociated itself from Stonewall, and that Oxford University had been ordered by the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office to reveal the scores and feedback it received from Stonewall as part of its workplace scheme, because there was &quot;an unusually strong public interest&quot;.

In March 2023, health secretary Steve Barclay wrote to ten health organisations asking them to reconsider their membership of the Diversity Champions scheme, because he wants them to decide whether to follow the Department of Health and end their memberships.

In March 2024, a spokesperson for the Scottish Parliament said their membership of Stonewall&#x27;s Diversity Champions scheme expired in February 2024 and that it would not be renewed.

In January 2025, it was reported that every major UK government department has left Stonewall’s Diversity Champions scheme. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, the exit from the scheme was because of &quot;concerns about the level of influence the lobby group had on shaping Whitehall’s internal policies.&quot;

==Transgender issues==
===Award nomination protests===
In 2008, transgender rights activists picketed the Stonewall Awards in protest of the nomination of &quot;The Guardian&quot; contributor Julie Bindel for Journalist of the Year, who had written a piece in 2004 entitled &quot;Gender Benders Beware&quot; asserting that sex reassignment surgery was &quot;unnecessary mutilation&quot;. Sue Perkins, winner of Entertainer of the Year, said she supported the decision to picket the event and that she was &quot;incredibly upset that anyone has been offended&quot;. Comedian Amy Lame, nominee for Entertainer of the Year, considered the protest &quot;insulting to Stonewall&quot;, which had &quot;achieved so much for so many people – gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender&quot;, saying &quot;all of those people have been included in laws they helped to change.&quot;

In 2010, &quot;The Sun&quot; journalist Bill Leckie was nominated for the same award for his column on gay rugby player Gareth Thomas, in spite of being criticised in a Stonewall Scotland report in 2007 for his comments regarding a drag queen bingo night. Several trans rights campaigners made a direct comparison between the Leckie and Bindel nominations. A similar demonstration was planned for the awards ceremony, but was cancelled after Stonewall withdrew the nomination. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Natacha Kennedy argued Stonewall was &quot;holding back transgender equality&quot;, highlighting the nomination and claiming that trans people are unable to join the organisation despite having been &quot;central to the 1969 Stonewall riots&quot;, as well as criticising the use of the pejorative term &quot;tranny&quot; in Stonewall&#x27;s anti-homophobia film &quot;Fit&quot;, aimed at secondary schools.

===Post-2015===
In 2015, Stonewall created an advisory group to help guide its work on transgender issues, and announced plans to start campaigning for trans equality in a report generated from consultation with over 700 trans people. Stonewall chief Ruth Hunt said that the organisation &quot;recognise[d] the impact of mistakes we have made in the past&quot; and &quot;apologise[d] to trans people for the harm that we have caused&quot;, listing the award nominations, use of the word &quot;tranny&quot;, and a failure to use their &quot;positions of privilege&quot; to discuss trans issues with ministers as &quot;a series of cockups&quot;. In 2017, the group produced a document outlining their plan for Transgender Equality in the UK titled &quot;A Vision for Change&quot;. In 2018, they released T-shirts with slogans opposing transphobia, such as &quot;Trans Women Are Women. Get Over It!&quot;, based on the organisation&#x27;s &quot;Some People are Gay. Get Over it!&quot; campaign from 2007.

In February 2019, Ruth Hunt stepped down amid controversy over the organisation&#x27;s support for transgender rights. In June 2020, she was succeeded by Nancy Kelley. In her first interview as incoming chief executive of Stonewall, Kelley argued that the organisation did not need to convince people to agree on a shared understanding of gender, and would instead focus on building support for &quot;changes that make trans lives easier&quot;, such as &quot;lower levels of hate crime, better access to health services and more inclusive schools and workplaces&quot;.

In October 2021, Kelley was quoted in the BBC News article &quot;We&#x27;re being pressured into sex by some trans women&quot;. She said: &quot;Nobody should ever be pressured into dating, or pressured into dating people they aren&#x27;t attracted to. But if you find that when dating, you are writing off entire groups of people, like people of colour, fat people, disabled people or trans people, then it&#x27;s worth considering how societal prejudices may have shaped your attractions.&quot;

In November 2021, Kelley spoke alongside &quot;gender critical&quot; barrister Naomi Cunningham and evangelical Christian campaigner Jayne Ozanne in a discussion on &quot;Banning Conversion Practices: The Path to Good Law&quot; during an event organised by the Middle Temple LGBTQ+ Forum. Maya Forstater described the event as &quot;historic&quot; because it is the first time that Stonewall has debated with those who oppose its position that &quot;trans women are women&quot;. Interviewed that month on Woman&#x27;s Hour on BBC Radio 4, Kelley said &quot;it&#x27;s absolutely possible for people to hold gender critical beliefs without expressing them in a way that&#x27;s harmful to trans people&quot;.

Writing in praise of Stonewall in &quot;The Spectator,&quot; James Kirkup, director of the Social Market Foundation, described Kelley&#x27;s appearance at the Middle Temple event and her live interview with Emma Barnett on Woman&#x27;s Hour as signals of a decision by Stonewall to engage in conversation, and that both are &quot;laudable things to do and entail no small courage&quot;. Still, he criticised Stonewall for persisting with the idea that &quot;sexual attraction based on anatomy is prejudice&quot;.

In July 2023, Kelley stepped down from her role as chief executive. Subsequently, the chair of trustees, Iain Anderson, called on all participants in the debate on transgender rights to &quot;lower the temperature&quot;.

===Opposition===
In October 2018, critics urged Stonewall to acknowledge that &quot;a conflict exists between transgenderism and sex-based women’s rights&quot;. In response, CEO Ruth Hunt wrote: &quot;We do not and will not acknowledge this. Doing so would imply that we do not believe that trans people deserve the same rights as others.&quot;

In October 2019, the lobby group LGB Alliance formed in opposition to Stonewall&#x27;s policies on transgender issues. Lesbian barrister Allison Bailey, who helped establish the organisation, initiated legal action against Stonewall in July 2020, claiming she had been victimised as a result. She lost all her claims against Stonewall, but the tribunal found that her Barristers&#x27; chambers had victimised her because of her tweet about the idea of a &quot;cotton ceiling&quot; and her belief that Stonewall had a dangerous agenda regarding gender self-identification.

In July 2022, NHS England responded to the Cass Review by deciding to close the NHS Gender Identity Development Service. Instead, it will create two new centres in London and Manchester. Stonewall praised the decision as an action to reduce unacceptable waiting times. &quot;The Economist&quot; described Stonewall&#x27;s response as putting &quot;a very brave face on it&quot;.

Also in July 2022, Stonewall received backlash and criticism for claiming that 2-year-olds could identify as transgender. The charity later published a clarification, saying that the original statement &quot;was unclear&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, Stonewall co-founder and former Conservative MP Matthew Parris criticised the charity for getting &quot;tangled up in the trans issue&quot; and being &quot;cornered into an extreme stance&quot;. Kelley responded that support for transgender rights was the norm for LGBT organisations and that she was &quot;really comfortable&quot; with Stonewall&#x27;s direction as an organisation.

Stonewall&#x27;s policy on self-identification has been criticised by founding members such as Simon Fanshawe, and actor and gay rights activist Simon Callow.

In November 2023, Minister for Women and Equalities Kemi Badenoch attacked Stonewall as having been taken over by &quot;leftist&quot; thinking. She said: &quot;It’s not the same Stonewall of 20 or 30 years ago, which started advising government and saying: ‘Well, this is what you need to do in order to serve a particular community.’ And then it overreached and started giving people legal advice or advice that is certainly different from what the Equality Act says.&quot; Stonewall defended its work, saying it provides expert guidance to employers to support LGBTQ+ people at work, and does not offer legal advice.

<text>Ras-I Alujah Bramble (born Livingstone Bramble; September 3, 1960) is a former professional boxer who was once the WBA Lightweight boxing champion of the world. Bramble was raised on Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. He became the first world champion from Saint Kitts and Nevis.

==Boxing career==
Bramble began boxing professionally on October 16, 1980, knocking out Jesus Serrano in round one. He would outpoint Serrano in a rematch. In his fourth fight, Bramble faced the more experienced, fringe contender Jorge Nina, winning by a disqualification in the second round.

On June 4, 1981, Bramble beat Ken Bogner by a knockout in seven rounds. But later that year, on August 31, he lost for the first time, in an eight-round decision to Anthony Fletcher. After that loss, he built a streak of thirteen wins in a row, including wins over former world title challengers James Busceme and Gaetan Hart, as well as top ten ranked fighters like Jerome Artis and Rafael Williams.

Bramble was given a shot at a world title when the WBA pitted him and Ray &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Mancini for the Lightweight title on June 1, 1984. Bramble entered the ring sporting a record of 20 wins and only one loss, with thirteen knockouts, but was a heavy underdog to Mancini, who had recently gone fourteen rounds with the legendary Alexis Argüello, and he was also coming off a successful title defense on January 14, a third-round knockout of two time world champion Bobby Chacon. Furthermore, talks about a &quot;super-fight&quot; between Mancini and IBF world Jr. Welterweight champion Aaron Pryor were already under way. Nevertheless, Bramble cut Mancini in round one and went on to become the WBA world Lightweight champion by a fourteenth-round knockout in Buffalo, New York. After this, &quot;The Ring&quot; published a cover of Bramble, WBA Jr. Lightweight world champion Rocky Lockridge, and their trainer Lou Duva. The cover read: &quot;The championship season&quot;.

After defeating Edwin Curet by a ten-round decision in a non-title bout, Bramble met Mancini in a rematch on February 16, 1985. In what marked the debut of the Compubox scoring system, Bramble defeated Mancini by an extremely close but unanimous fifteen-round decision to retain his world title at Reno, Nevada, in front of an HBO Boxing audience.

After Héctor Camacho defeated José Luis Ramírez to claim the WBC title on August 10 of that year, there was widespread talk about a series of fights between Bramble, Camacho and IBF world Lightweight champion Jimmy Paul, to see who would become the unified world champion.

Exactly one year after defeating Mancini for the second time, Bramble defeated the WBA&#x27;s number one challenger, Tyrone Crawley, by a knockout in round thirteen.

Bramble&#x27;s next defense was supposed to be a preparation fight for him to meet Camacho. He and Camacho each defended their crowns on September 26, in what was nicknamed &quot;The Preamble to Bramble&quot;. However, in what many saw as a surprise, Bramble lost his title to former WBC lightweight champion Edwin Rosario, who knocked him out in two rounds at Miami.

After this loss, Bramble never regained his status as a top lightweight. He fought on, and met some future or former world champions such as Freddie Pendleton, Charles Murray, James &quot;Buddy&quot; McGirt, Roger Mayweather, Rafael Ruelas and Kostya Tszyu, as well as world title challengers like Wilfredo Rivera, Oba Carr and Darryl Tyson. However, he was on the losing end of most of these fights.

During the 1990s Bramble went through several name changes, often fighting under the names of Ras-I-Bramble or Abuja Bramble.

==Professional boxing record==

==Personal life==

When Bramble became a world champion, rumors of him practicing witchcraft became widespread. He did not deny these rumours. Bramble did enjoy walking around with his pet snake. He used to walk into the boxing ring with one on his neck, and he was pictured, again on the cover of &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;, with his snake. In 1985, Bramble stated that he hates chickens and he strangles them. It was also reported that Bramble had skinned a dead cat and put it on his living room wall. During this time he had a boa constrictor and a ferret named spider. He also had a dog named snake. He described himself as &quot;the only Rasta prizefighter there is&quot;.

Bramble is often reported to being a long-term vegetarian who has not eaten meat since the early 1970s, however he does eat fish and his diet has been described as consisting &quot;primarily of fish, spaghetti, fungi, pumpkin and coconuts&quot;.

An avid marathon runner, Bramble competes each year at the International Boxing Hall of Fame&#x27;s celebrity marathon. He is one of the most sought after autograph signers there every year. Bramble currently lives in Las Vegas. Bramble is the subject of a full biography by boxing journalist Brian D&#x27;Ambrosio. The book is titled &quot;Rasta in the Ring: The Life of Rastafarian Boxer Livingstone Bramble&quot; and was published in 2016. The book dissects and explains the life and beliefs of the Rastafarian boxer.

<text>The Campos Basin is one of 12 coastal sedimentary basins of Brazil. It spans both onshore and offshore parts of the South Atlantic with the onshore part located near Rio de Janeiro. The basin originated in Neocomian stage of the Cretaceous period 145–130 million years ago during the breakup of Gondwana. It has a total area of about , with the onshore portion small at only .

== Etymology ==
The basin is named after the Campos dos Goytacazes city.

== Description ==
The Campos Basin is bound on the south by the Cabo Frio High, separating the basin from the Santos Basin and on the north by the Vitória High, forming the boundary with the Espírito Santo Basin. Campos Basin contains the Paraiba do Sul River delta.

=== Tectonic history ===
The South Atlantic margin developed on Archean stable cratons consisting of hard and resistant rocks and partly on the Neoproterozoic mobile belts composed of less resistant metamorphic rocks. The Precambrian basement of the Santos Basin is exposed as the Araçuaí Belt along the Brazilian coast, most notably in the inselbergs of Rio de Janeiro, of which Sugarloaf Mountain is the most iconic. The ancient rocks consist of a Neoproterozoic to Cambrian high-grade metamorphic core of granites and gneisses, formed during the collision of Gondwana in the Pan-African-Brasiliano orogeny. Basalts similar to the Paraná and Etendeka traps, exposed to the west in the Paraná Basin, have been found underlying the Santos Basin. The Tristan da Cunha hotspot, known as the Tristan hotspot, is considered the driver behind the formation of these flood basalts.

During the Early Cretaceous, the former continent Gondwana, as southern part of Pangea, starting to break-up, resulting in a sequence of rift basins bordering the present-day South Atlantic. The Pelotas-Namibia spreading commenced in the Hauterivian, around 133 million years ago and reached the Santos Basin to the north in the Barremian. Seafloor spreading continued northwards to the Campos Basin in the Early Albian, at approximately 112 Ma.

Five tectonic stages have been identified in the Brazilian basins:
# Pre-rift stage – Jurassic to Valanginian
# Syn-rift stage – Hauterivian to Late Barremian
# Sag stage – Late Barremian to Late Aptian
# Post-rift stage – Early to Middle Albian
# Drift stage – Late Albian to Holocene

=== Stratigraphy ===
Oil reservoirs include formations deposited during the Aptian and pre-Aptian continental rift phase, of post-salt Albian-Cenomanian shallow-water marine carbonates and deepwater sandstones, and in turbidites of the open marine drift phase of Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary ages.

The Namorado Field &quot;location was selected based on seismic interpretation of a structural high at the top of the Macaé Formation (Albian limestones)&quot; at a depth of about , and the reservoirs are marine turbidite deposits transgressing over the Albian limestone shelf.

The stratigraphy starts with basalt flows dated at 120 Ma, overlain by the Lagoa Feia Group, consisting of the organic-rich lacustrine &quot;green shales&quot; followed by lacustrine limestones and continental sandstones and conglomerates, transitioning into marine sediments with evaporites, limestones, and limestone altered dolomites. The shallow marine limestones of the Macaé Formation follow, then the Namorado turbidite sandstones, and finally the Campos Formation, consisting of the turbidite sandstone Carapebus Member and the prograding slope and shelf Ubatuba Formation.

== Exploration ==

The off-shore oil exploration in the Campos Basin began in 1968. The first exploratory well was drilled in 1971. The first field to be discovered was Garoupa in 1974, at a shallow water depth of , followed by Namorado in 1975 in of water. The first oil production started in 1977 from Enchova Field, at a water depth of . The largest fields, listed by their year of discovery year, include Linguado (1978), Carapeba (1982), Vermelho (1982), Marimba (1984), Albacora (1984), Marlim (1985), Albacora-Leste (1986), Marlim Sul (1987), Marlim Leste (1987), Barracuda (1989), Caratinga (1989), Espadarte (1994), Roncador (1996), Jubarte (2002), Cachalote (2002), and Badejo (2008). The largest Marlim field is located in the northeast of the basin, offshore in water depths ranging from .

By 2003, 41 oil and gas fields were discovered, which ranging at distances from from the coast and at water depths varying from . Of these fields, 37 are being developed by Petrobras. By 2003, the oil production from the basin had reached 1.21 million barrels per day. The production comes from a variety of reservoirs including siliciclastic turbidites, fractured basalts, coquinas, calcarenites (limestones). The total cumulative production from the Campos Basin by 2003 was 3.9 billion barrels of oil with remaining reserves of 8.5 billion barrels.

In February 2010, a new 65 million barrel discovery was made by Petrobras near the Barracuda oil field.

In 2020, the Enchova, Enchova Oeste, Marimbá, Piraúna, Bicudo, Bonito, Pampo, Trilha, Linguado, and Badejo concessions were sold by Petrobras to Trident Energy. These concessions are located in the shallow part of the Campos Basin, offshore Rio de Janeiro state.

<text>The coat of arms of Jordan or the emblem of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is the arms of dominion for the king of Jordan. The emblem was initially adopted by Abdullah I, the emir of Transjordan, in 1921. The emblem continued to be used after Transjordan emerged as an independent kingdom in 1946.

==History==
On August 25, 1934, the Executive Council (the Council of Ministers at the time) issued Directive No. 558 declaring the coat of arms of the Emirate of Trans-Jordan (as the state, a British protectorate, was called at the time). The arms had been originally designed in 1921 at the request of Emir Abdullah I as the official emblem of the country, outlining its specific design layout at that time. The emirate, which had been established in April 1921, officially became the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan upon its declaration of independence in May 1946, officially becoming independent on 17 June 1946. The state was officially renamed as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in April 1949.

On 21 February 1982, the Council of Ministers issued the official Notification No. 6, which gave written specifications and explanations of the official emblem of the country.

==Description==
The emblem was officially described in a notification issued by the Council of Ministers in 1982.

The Royal Hashemite Crown represents the monarchy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and is composed of five arches with beaded design, fanning out from beneath its pinnacle and attached to the base with a relief design recalling rubies and emeralds. On top of the base rest five lotus flowers, denoting purity. The Royal Hashemite Crown is adorned at the top by the tip of a spear that represents the Hashemite banner. The Royal Hashemite Crown rests on the sash that represents the Royal Hashemite Throne. The crimson velvet sash, lined with white silk, signifies sacrifice and purity. The sash is trimmed in a fringe of golden threads and gathered on either side with golden tasselled cords to reveal a white silk lining.

The two flags represent the flag of the Great Arab Revolt. The length of each is double its width and each is divided horizontally into three equal parts: the upper black panel, the middle green panel and the lower white panel. The crimson triangle occupies the front. Its base is equal to the width of the flag while its length is equal to half that of the flag. The eagle symbolises power, fortitude and loftiness. Its colours signify the banner and turban of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The eagle stands on the globe, its wings touching the flags on both ends. The eagle&#x27;s head faces its right. The blue globe signifies the emergence of Islamic civilisation.

In the coat of arms appears Arab weaponry. A bronze shield is decorated with a chrysanthemum, a common motif in Arab art and architecture. The shield is placed in front of the globe, symbolising the defence of the right. Golden swords and spears, bows and arrows protrude from either side of the shield and the globe. Encircling the shield from its base are three ears of wheat on the right and a palm frond to the left. They are attached to the ribbon of the Al Nahda First Order Medal.

The medal of Al Nahda First Order is suspended from the centre of the ribbon. A yellow ribbon placed across the ribbon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance, is composed of three parts inscribed with phrases, as follows: &quot;Abdullah I ibn Al Hussein Bin Aoun (Aoun, the great-grandfather of Sharif Al Hussein Bin Ali)&quot; on the right, &quot;King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan&quot; in the middle and &quot;He who seeks support and guidance from God&quot; on the left.

<text>The year 1784 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events.

==Astronomy==
* September 10 – Edward Pigott identifies the variable star Eta Aquilae from York, England.
* October 19 – John Goodricke begins his observations of the variable star Delta Cephei from York.

==Biology==
* Publication of the &quot;Annals of Agriculture&quot; edited by Arthur Young begins in Great Britain.
* Peter Simon Pallas begins publication of &quot;Flora Rossica&quot;, the first Flora of Russia.

==Chemistry==
* L&#x27;Abbé René Just Haüy states the geometrical law of crystallization.
* Antoine Lavoisier pioneers stoichiometry.
* Citric acid is first isolated by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who crystallizes it from lemon juice.
* Cholesterol is isolated.

==History of science==
* Publication of David Bourgeois&#x27; &quot;Recherches sur l&#x27;art de voler, depuis la plus haute antiquité jusque&#x27;a ce jour&quot; in Paris, the earliest work on the history of flight.

==Mathematics==
* Carl Friedrich Gauss, at the age of seven, pioneers the field of summation with the formula summing 1:n as (n(n+1))/2.

==Medicine==
* 11 February – Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland chartered.
* 12 March — Appointment of the French Royal Commission on Animal Magnetism (the Commission&#x27;s Report was presented to King Louis XVI on 11 August 1784).
* Madame du Coudray, pioneer of modern midwifery in France, retires.
* Benjamin Franklin makes the first known specific reference (in a letter) to the wearing of bifocal spectacles.
* John Hunter first describes the condition phlebitis.

==Paleontology==
* The first description of a &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; fossil is made by Cosimo Alessandro Collini, although he is unable to determine what kind of creature it is.

==Surveying==
* William Roy measures the baseline for the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) linking the observatories of Paris and Greenwich. The measurement is accurate to within a few inches in a distance of over 280,000 ft., an unprecedented accuracy for this time. Roy is awarded the Copley Medal in the following year.

==Technology==
* April 28 – James Watt receives a British patent for his parallel motion and other improvements to the steam engine.

<text>The year 1783 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events:

==Astronomy==

* February 26 – Caroline Herschel discovers NGC 2360.
* May – John Goodricke presents his conclusions that the variable star Algol is what comes to be known as an eclipsing binary to the Royal Society of London.
* August 18 – Great Meteor passes over Great Britain, exciting scientific interest.
* November 27 – John Michell proposes the existence of black holes (&quot;dark stars&quot;).
* Jérôme Lalande publishes a revised edition of John Flamsteed’s star catalogue in an ephemeris, &quot;Éphémérides des mouvemens célestes&quot;, numbering the stars consecutively by constellation, the system which becomes known as &quot;Flamsteed designations&quot;.

==Aviation==
* June 5 – The Montgolfier brothers send up at Annonay, near Lyon, a 900 m linen hot air balloon as a public demonstration. Its flight covers 2 km and lasts 10 minutes, to an estimated altitude of 1600–2000 metres.
* August 27 – Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers launch the first hydrogen balloon in Paris.
* November 21 – The first free flight by humans in a balloon is made by Pilâtre de Rozier and Marquis d&#x27;Arlandes who fly aloft for 25 minutes about 100 metres above Paris for a distance of 9 km.

<text>The Shasta Cascade region of California is located in the northeastern and north-central sections of the state bordering Oregon and Nevada, including far northern parts of the Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

== History ==
=== Indigenous cultures ===
Historically, the Shasta Cascade region was home to Native Americans of the Modoc, Maidu, Okwanuchu, Paiute, Shasta, Wintu, and Yana tribes, and sub-groups of those tribes.
=== Colonialism ===
The first non-Native Americans entered the Shasta Cascade region by coming south along the Siskiyou Trail from Oregon, or north along the Siskiyou Trail from central California or the San Francisco Bay Area. These earliest explorers were probably British and American fur-trappers and traders in the 1820s and 1830s, although it is also possible that Spanish explorers reached the southern edge of the Shasta Cascade region before 1820.
=== Gold rush ===
The discovery of gold in 1851 at Yreka (and throughout Siskiyou and Trinity counties) brought the California Gold Rush-era prospectors up the rivers of the region in search of gold, leading to the first non-Native American settlements in the area, including at Old Shasta, Portuguese Flat, Upper Soda Springs, Weaverville, and Yreka itself.

== Geography ==
There are seven national forests in the Shasta Cascade region: Klamath National Forest, Lassen National Forest, Modoc National Forest, Plumas National Forest and Shasta–Trinity National Forest, as well as the Lava Beds National Monument.

The area is also well known for its numerous lakes, rivers, and waterfalls, including Shasta Lake, Trinity Lake, Lake Almanor, Eagle Lake, and Lake Siskiyou, the Sacramento River, McCloud River, Feather River, Trinity River, and Pit River, as well as Mossbrae Falls, the McCloud River Falls, and Burney Falls.

Numerous parks and recreation opportunities fill the area including Shasta Lake, Lake Siskiyou, Castle Crags State Park, a new park at Upper Soda Springs, the Trinity Alps, Lava Beds National Monument, Clair Engle Lake, Castle Lake, Lassen Volcanic National Park, Caribou Wilderness, Thousand Lakes Wilderness, and climbing Mount Shasta.

== Metropolitan areas ==
The civic &quot;capital&quot; of the Shasta Cascade area is Redding; other cities and towns are Alturas, Biggs, Chico, Susanville, Dunsmuir, Mount Shasta, Red Bluff, Oroville, Paradise, Weed, Fall River Mills, Burney, and Yreka. Counties included in the Shasta Cascade region include Butte, Lassen, Modoc, Plumas, Shasta, Siskiyou, Tehama and Trinity.

== Geology ==
Geologically, this region is similar to the main Cascade Range, dominated by volcanism.

<text>Le Rouge et le Noir (; meaning The Red and the Black) is a psychological novel in two volumes by Stendhal, published in 1830. It chronicles the attempts of a provincial young man to rise socially beyond his modest upbringing through a combination of talent, hard work, deception, and hypocrisy. He ultimately allows his passions to betray him.

The novel&#x27;s full title, Le Rouge et le Noir: Chronique du XIXe siècle (&quot;The Red and the Black: A Chronicle of the 19th Century&quot;), indicates its twofold literary purpose as both a psychological portrait of the romantic protagonist, Julien Sorel, and an analytic, sociological satire of the French social order under the Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830). In English, &quot;Le Rouge et le Noir&quot; variously is translated as &quot;Red and Black&quot;, &quot;Scarlet and Black&quot;, and &quot;The Red and the Black&quot;, without the subtitle.

The title is taken to refer to the tension between the clerical and secular interests of the protagonist, represented by each of the title colors, but it could also refer to the then-popular card game &quot;rouge et noir&quot;, with the card game being the narratological leitmotiv of a novel in which chance and luck determine the fate of the main character. There are other interpretations as well.

==Background==
&quot;Le Rouge et le Noir&quot; is the Bildungsroman of Julien Sorel, the intelligent and ambitious protagonist. He comes from a poor family and fails to understand much about the ways of the world he sets out to conquer. He harbours many romantic illusions, but becomes mostly a pawn in the political machinations of the ruthless and influential people about him. The adventures of the hero satirize early 19th-century French society, accusing the aristocracy and Catholic clergy of being hypocritical and materialistic, foretelling the radical changes that will soon depose them from their leading roles in French society.

The first volume&#x27;s epigraph &quot;La vérité, l&#x27;âpre vérité&quot; (&quot;The truth, the harsh truth&quot;) is attributed to Danton, but like most of the chapters&#x27; epigraphs it is fictional. The title refers (among other things—see meanings in previous section) to the contrasting uniforms of the army and the church. Accordingly, early in the story, Julien Sorel observes that under the Bourbon Restoration it is impossible for a man of his plebeian class to distinguish himself in the (red-uniformed) army (as he might have done under Napoleon), hence only a (black-uniformed) church career offers social advancement and glory.

In complete editions, the first book (&quot;Livre premier&quot;, ending after Chapter XXX) concludes with the quotation &quot;To the Happy Few&quot; from &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; by Oliver Goldsmith, parts of which Stendhal had memorized in the course of teaching himself English. In &quot;The Vicar&quot;, &quot;the happy few&quot; read the title character&#x27;s obscure and pedantic treatise on monogamy—alone.

==Plot==
In two volumes, &quot;The Red and the Black: A Chronicle of the 19th Century&quot; tells the story of Julien Sorel&#x27;s life in France&#x27;s rigid social structure restored after the disruptions of the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte.

===Book I===
Julien Sorel, the ambitious son of a carpenter in the fictional village of Verrières, in Franche-Comté, France, would rather read and daydream about the glorious victories of Napoleon&#x27;s long-disbanded army than work in his father&#x27;s timber business with his brothers, who beat him for his intellectual pretensions. He becomes an acolyte of the Abbé Chélan, the local Catholic prelate, who secures for Julien a job tutoring the children of Monsieur de Rênal, the mayor of Verrières. Although representing himself as a pious, austere cleric, Julien is uninterested in religious studies beyond the Bible&#x27;s literary value and his ability to use memorized Latin passages to impress his social superiors.

He begins a love affair with Monsieur de Rênal&#x27;s wife, which ends when her chambermaid, Elisa, who is also in love with Julien, makes it known to the village. The Abbé Chélan orders Julien to a seminary in Besançon, which he finds intellectually stifling and populated by social cliques. The initially cynical seminary director, the Abbé Pirard, likes Julien and becomes his protector. When the Abbé, a Jansenist, leaves the seminary, he fears Julien will suffer for having been his protégé and recommends Sorel as private secretary to the diplomat Marquis de la Mole, a Catholic legitimist.

===Book II===

In the years leading up to the July Revolution of 1830, Julien Sorel lives in Paris as an employee of the de la Mole family. Despite his sophistication and intellect, Julien is condescended to as an uncouth plebeian by the de la Moles and their friends. Meanwhile, Julien is acutely aware of the materialism and hypocrisy that permeate the Parisian elite and that the counterrevolutionary temper of the time renders it impossible for even well-born men of superior intellect and aesthetic sensibility to participate in the nation&#x27;s public affairs.

Julien accompanies the Marquis de la Mole to a secret meeting, then is dispatched on a dangerous mission to communicate a letter from memory to the Duc d&#x27;Angoulême, who is exiled in England; but the callow Julien is distracted by an unrequited love affair and learns the message only by rote, missing its political significance as part of a legitimist plot. Unwittingly, he risks his life in service to the monarchists he most opposes; to himself, he rationalises these actions as merely helping the Marquis, his employer, whom he respects.

Meanwhile, the Marquis&#x27;s languorous daughter, Mathilde de la Mole, has become emotionally torn between her romantic attraction to Julien for his admirable personal and intellectual qualities and her revulsion at becoming sexually intimate with a lower-class man. At first Julien finds her unattractive, but his interest is piqued by her attentions and the admiration she inspires in others; twice, she seduces and rejects him, leaving him in a miasma of despair, self-doubt, and happiness (for having won her over her aristocratic suitors). Only during his secret mission does he learn the key to winning her affections: a cynical &quot;jeu d&#x27;amour&quot; (game of love) taught to him by Prince Korasoff, a Russian man-of-the-world. At great emotional cost, Julien feigns indifference to Mathilde, provoking her jealousy with a sheaf of love letters meant to woo Madame de Fervaques, a widow in the social circle of the de la Mole family. Consequently, Mathilde sincerely falls in love with Julien, eventually revealing to him that she carries his child; nevertheless, while he is on diplomatic mission in England, she becomes officially engaged to Monsieur de Croisenois, an amiable and wealthy young noble, heir to a duchy.

Learning of Julien&#x27;s liaison with Mathilde, the Marquis de la Mole is angered, but he relents before her determination and his affection for Julien and bestows upon Julien an income-producing property attached to an aristocratic title as well as a military commission in the army. Although ready to bless their marriage, the marquis changes his mind after receiving a character-reference letter about Julien from the Abbé Chélan, Julien&#x27;s previous employer in Verrières. Written by Madame de Rênal at the urging of her confessor priest, the letter warns the marquis that Julien is a social-climbing cad who preys upon emotionally vulnerable women.

On learning that the marquis now withholds his blessing of his marriage, Julien Sorel returns with a gun to Verrières and shoots Madame de Rênal during Mass in the village church; she survives, but Julien is imprisoned and sentenced to death. Mathilde tries to save him by bribing local officials, and Madame de Rênal, still in love with him, refuses to testify and pleads for his acquittal, aided by the priests who have looked after him since his early childhood. Yet Julien is determined to die, for the materialistic society of Restoration France has no place for a low-born man, whatever his intellect or sensibilities.

Meanwhile, Monsieur de Croisenois, the presumptive duke and one of the fortunate few of Bourbon France, is killed in a duel over a slur upon the honour of Mathilde de la Mole. Her undiminished love for Julien, his imperiously intellectual nature and romantic exhibitionism render Mathilde&#x27;s prison visits to him a duty to endure and little more.

When Julien learns that Madame de Rênal survived her gunshot wound, his authentic love for her is resurrected, having lain dormant throughout his Parisian sojourn, and she continues to visit him in jail. After he is guillotined, Mathilde de la Mole reenacts the cherished 16th-century French tale of Queen Margot, who visited her dead lover, Joseph Boniface de La Mole, to kiss the forehead of his severed head. Mathilde then erects a shrine at Julien&#x27;s tomb in the Italian fashion. Madame de Rênal, more quietly, dies in the arms of her children only three days later.

==Structure and themes==
&quot;Le Rouge et le Noir&quot; is set in the latter years of the Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830) and the days of the 1830 July Revolution that established the Kingdom of the French (1830–1848). Julien Sorel&#x27;s worldly ambitions are motivated by the emotional tensions between his idealistic Republicanism and his nostalgic allegiance to Napoleon and the realistic politics of counter-revolutionary conspiracy by Jesuit-supported legitimists, notably the Marquis de la Mole, whom Julien serves for personal gain. Presuming a knowledgeable reader, Stendhal only alludes to the historical background of &quot;Le Rouge et le Noir&quot;—yet did subtitle the novel &quot;Chronique de 1830&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of 1830&quot;). Similarly, the historical background is depicted in &quot;Lucien Leuwen&quot; (1834), one of Stendhal&#x27;s unfinished novels, posthumously published in 1894. Erich Auerbach in &quot;&quot; sees this use of specific historical context as something entirely new in literature: &quot;So logically and systematically to situate the tragically conceived life of a man of low social position (as here that of Julien Sorel) within the most concrete kind of contemporary history and to develop it therefrom— this is an entirely new and highly significant phenomenon.&quot;

Stendhal repeatedly questions the possibility and the desirability of &quot;sincerity&quot; because most of the characters, especially Julien Sorel, are acutely aware of having to play a role to gain social approval. In that 19th-century context, the word &quot;hypocrisy&quot; denoted the affectation of high religious sentiment; in &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; it connotes the contradiction between thinking and feeling.

In &quot;Mensonge romantique et vérité romanesque&quot; (&quot;Deceit, Desire and the Novel&quot;, 1961), philosopher and critic René Girard identifies in &quot;Le Rouge et le Noir&quot; the triangular structure he denominates as &quot;mimetic desire&quot;; that is, one desires a person only when he or she is desired by someone else. Girard&#x27;s proposition is that a person&#x27;s desire for another always is mediated by a third party. This triangulation thus accounts for the perversity of the Mathilde–Julien relationship, which is most evident when Julien begins courting the widow Mme de Fervaques to pique Mathilde&#x27;s jealousy, and it accounts for Julien&#x27;s fascination with and membership in the high society he simultaneously desires and despises. To help achieve a literary effect, Stendhal wrote most of the epigraphs—literary, poetic, historic quotations—that he attributed to others.

==Literary and critical significance==
André Gide stated that &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; was a novel ahead of its time, that it was a novel for readers in the 20th century. In Stendhal&#x27;s time, prose novels included dialogue and descriptions from omniscient narrator; Stendhal&#x27;s great contribution to literary technique was the describing of the psychologies (emotions, thoughts, and interior monologues) of the characters. As a result, he is considered the creator of the psychological novel.

In Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s play &quot;Les Mains sales&quot; (1948), the protagonist Hugo Barine suggests pseudonyms for himself, including Julien Sorel, whom he resembles.

In the afterword to her novel &quot;them&quot;, Joyce Carol Oates wrote that she had titled the manuscript &quot;Love and Money&quot; as a nod to classic 19th-century novels, among them &quot;The Red and the Black&quot;, &quot;whose class-conscious hero Julien Sorel is less idealistic, greedier, and crueler than Jules Wendall but is clearly his spiritual kinsman.&quot;

A passage describing Julien Sorel&#x27;s sexual indifference is deployed as the epigraph to Paul Schrader&#x27;s screenplay of &quot;American Gigolo&quot;, whose protagonist is named Julien: &quot;The idea of a duty to be performed, and the fear of making himself ridiculous if he failed to perform it, immediately removed all pleasure from his heart.&quot;

Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore named &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; as his favorite book.

==Translations==
Le Rouge et le Noir&quot;, Chronique du XIXe siècle (1830) first was translated into English ca. 1900; the best-known translation, The Red and the Black&quot; (1926) by C. K. Scott Moncrieff, has been, like his other translations, characterised as one of his &quot;fine, spirited renderings, not entirely accurate on minor points of meaning...Scott Moncrieff&#x27;s versions have not really been superseded.&quot; The version by Robert M. Adams for the Norton Critical Editions series is highly regarded; it &quot;is more colloquial; his edition includes an informative section on backgrounds and sources, and excerpts from critical studies.&quot; Other translators include Margaret R. B. Shaw (as &quot;Scarlet and Black&quot; for Penguin Classics, 1953), Lowell Blair (Bantam Books, 1959), Lloyd C. Parks (New York, 1970), Catherine Slater (Oxford World&#x27;s Classics, 1991), Roger Gard (Penguin Classics, 2002), and Raymond N. MacKenzie (University of Minnesota Press, 2022).

The 2006 translation by Burton Raffel for the Modern Library edition generally earned positive reviews, and Salon.com stated &quot;[Burton Raffel&#x27;s] exciting new translation of &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; blasts Stendhal into the twenty-first century.&quot; Michael Johnson for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;Now &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; is getting a new lease on life with an updated English-language version by the renowned translator Burton Raffel. His version has all but replaced the decorous text produced in the 1920s by the Scottish-born writer-translator C.K. Scott-Moncrieff&quot;.

==Burned in 1964 Brazil==
Following the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état, General , commander of the Third Army, ordered, in Rio Grande do Sul, the burning of all &quot;subversive books&quot;. Among the books he branded as subversive was &quot;The Red and the Black&quot;.

<text>Florian Stanisław Ceynowa (Kashubian &quot;Florión Cenôwa&quot;) (May 4, 1817 – March 26, 1881) was a doctor, political activist, writer, and linguist. He undertook efforts to identify Kashubian language, culture and traditions. He and Alexander Hilferding were not the only ones to study the language and legends of the Kashubians, but they had the greatest influence and prompted others to take up investigations. The individual nature of the Kashubian character and language was first described by Hilferding, to whom we are indebted for the first data about the range of Kashubian dialects. In 1856, he and Ceynowa traveled to the Kashubia. He awakened Kashubian self-identity, thereby opposing Germanisation and Prussian authority, and Polish nobility and clergy. He believed in a separate Kashubian identity and strove for a Russian-led pan-Slavic federation. He strove to create a program aimed at the introduction of a Kashubian standard in grammar, pronunciation and spelling, based on the spirit of the 1848 Revolution. He compiled treatises on Kashubian grammar and published Kashubian texts along with their translations into other Slavic languages. An important person for Kashubian literature, he was also a translator of Russian texts into Kashubian language.

Ceynowa was a pioneer of the nationalist movement among the Kashubian people in the mid-19th century. He was part of an attempt to take the Prussian garrison in Preußisch Stargard (Starogard Gdański) during 1846, but the operation failed when his 100 combatants, armed only with scythes, decided to abandon the site before the attack was carried out.

<text>Pitfall! is a video game developed by David Crane for the Atari 2600 and released in 1982 by Activision. The player controls Pitfall Harry, who has a time limit of 20 minutes to seek treasure in a jungle. The game world is populated by enemies and hazards that variously cause the player to lose lives or points.

Crane had made several games for both Atari, Inc. and Activision before working on &quot;Pitfall!&quot; in 1982. He started with creating a new realistic-style walking animation for a person on the Atari 2600 hardware. After completing it, he fashioned a game around it. He used a jungle setting with items to collect and enemies to avoid, and the result became &quot;Pitfall!&quot;

&quot;Pitfall!&quot; received mostly positive reviews at the time of its release praising both its gameplay and graphics. The game was influential in the platform game genre and various publications have considered it one of the greatest video games of all time. It is also one of the best-selling Atari 2600 video games. The game was ported to several contemporary video game systems. It has been included in various Activision compilation games and was included as a secret extra in later Activision-published titles.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Pitfall!&quot; is a video game set in a jungle where the player controls Pitfall Harry, a fortune hunter and explorer. &quot;Pitfall!&quot; has been characterized as a platformer by Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost, the authors of &quot;Racing the Beam&quot;. Similar to &quot;Superman&quot; (1979) and &quot;Adventure&quot; (1980), the game does not feature side-scrolling and instead loads one screen at a time, with a new screen appearing when the player character, Pitfall Harry, moves to the edge of the screen. The goal is to get Harry as many points as possible within a twenty-minute time limit. The player starts the game with 2,000 points and can collect a total of 32 treasure hidden among 255 scenes to increase their total, ranging from a money bag worth 2,000 points to a diamond ring worth 5,000 points.

Pitfall Harry moves left and right and can jump over and onto objects, swing from vines, and climb up and down ladders to seek treasure and avoid danger. The player can lose points from hazards, such as falling down a hole or colliding with rolling logs. The player starts with three lives and loses one if they sink into quicksand, swamps or tar pits, running into fire, or are hit by a scorpion, cobra rattler, or crocodile.

==Development==
&quot;Pitfall!&quot; was developed by David Crane for Activision. Crane had worked at Atari, Inc. in the late 1970s, developing games for the Atari Video Computer System. The system became known as the Atari 2600 after the release of the Atari 5200 in 1982. After discovering the high profits Atari had made from games he developed, including &quot;Outlaw&quot;, &quot;Canyon Bomber&quot; and &quot;Slot Machine&quot;, he asked the president of Atari, Ray Kassar, for recognition on these titles and better pay. When he was turned down, Crane and other Atari programmers left the company to form Activision in 1979. Crane was the senior designer at Activision and created &quot;Dragster&quot;, &quot;Fishing Derby&quot;, &quot;Laser Blast&quot;, &quot;Freeway&quot; and &quot;Grand Prix&quot; for the company prior to the release of &quot;Pitfall!&quot;

Crane stated his game design philosophy involved making the Atari 2600 do new and unexpected things. Crane said he &quot;used this technique to lead me in a new direction of game design, and some of the tricks were to me as much as an accomplishment as solving the Rubik&#x27;s Cube the first time&quot;. Early development of &quot;Pitfall!&quot; started with Crane trying to create realistically animated graphics on the Atari 2600. This led to developing a moving man (which became the basis of Pitfall Harry) and, later, the scorpions and snake obstacles. For three years, Crane experimented using the running-man character in different scenarios, such as a cops and robbers game, but could not find a proper situation for it. Crane began implementing it into a game in 1982. Crane stated having the running man animation led to putting him on a path, which led to placing the path in a jungle and giving the man a reason to run in order to hunt treasures and avoid enemies. The jungle setting of the game was influenced by the 1981 film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.

Other influences came from Heckle and Jeckle cartoons, where two magpies outwit their enemies, including having the magpies run across the heads of crocodiles and just escaping their snapping jaws. This led to the ability of Pitfall Harry being able to cross ponds infested with crocodiles if their jaws were closed. Initially, to jump from one alligator head to another, the player had to move the joystick and jump at exactly the same time which Crane described as being &quot;almost impossible to play. So I changed the code to allow you to direct Harry’s jump to the side, if you moved the joystick within a small instant from the time you pressed the button to jump. From a programming standpoint this was a tiny change, but it changed the gameplay from nearly impossible to an easily learned skill.&quot; Crane tried to make the sprite artwork for obstacles and the environment recognizable to players, despite the limitations of the Atari 2600. The process involved what Crane said was &quot;a lot of trial-and-error&quot;. When asked if the arcade game &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981) had inspired his game, Crane responded he did not draw any parallels to &quot;Pitfall!&quot; at the time and had already developed elements in his game that were present in both games, such as a human character, paths, and ladders.

Crane commented that &quot;The entire [game design] process took about 10 minutes. About 1000 hours of programming later the game was complete.&quot; Much of Crane&#x27;s time was spent optimizing and compressing the code so that it would fit into a four-kilobyte ROM cartridge. Unlike &quot;Haunted House&quot; (1982) or &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1982), where the environments were hard-coded into the game, &quot;Pitfall!&quot; was generated constantly by code. The game generates each screen based on a counter that could run either backwards or forwards depending which direction the player moved from screen to screen. The 8 bits in the counter were used to determine certain details such as the background, trees, ground and object patterns, allowing 255 screens to occupy fewer than 50 bytes of ROM. Activision had created design centers for their games, which were small, close-knit teams of four to five people. These teams encouraged peer reviews and shared prototypes of games. In &quot;Pitfall!&quot;, Crane&#x27;s team changed the initial number of lives in the game from one to three during the final week of development. Crane said that &quot;my buddies practically tied me to my chair until I put in extra lives and I&#x27;m glad they did&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Pitfall!&quot; was released for the Atari 2600 in September 1982. The game was later released for the Intellivision in November 1982. To promote the game, Activision held a promotion between November 15 and December 13, 1982, in various markets across the United States for a chance to win $5,000 in gold. In January 1984, it was announced that &quot;Pitfall!&quot; would be released along with other Activision titles such as &quot;River Raid&quot;, &quot;Megamania&quot;, and &quot;Beamrider&quot; for the Atari 5200, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, and MSX. &quot;Pitfall!&quot; was subsequently released for the ColecoVision in February, the Atari 8-bit computers and Atari 5200 in March, and the Commodore 64 in June. It was released in Japan for the MSX in September 1984.

&quot;Pitfall!&quot; was included in various video games collections, including &quot;Activision Classics&quot; (1998) for the PlayStation, &quot;Activision Anthology&quot; (2002) for PlayStation 2, and &quot;Activision Hits Remixed&quot; in 2006 for the PlayStation Portable. The game was also a secret extra in Activision-published titles like &quot;&quot; (1994), &quot;Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare&quot; (2016), and &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&quot; (2020).

==Reception==

In contemporary reviews, critics praised the gameplay and graphics in publications like &quot;Arcade Express&quot; and &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot;, with the former stating that it &quot;may well be the best adventure game yet produced for the VCS&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;Blip&quot; stated that the game was similar to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981), but that &quot;this is one case where inspiration didn&#x27;t lead to imitation. &quot;Pitfall&quot; is its own game. It&#x27;s also a heck of a lot of fun.&quot; In &quot;JoyStik: How to Win at Video Games&quot;, the game was named as one of the ten best games of 1982. The Atari 2600 version of &quot;Pitfall!&quot; was awarded &quot;Best Adventure Video Game&quot; at the 4th annual Arkie Awards in 1983.

Reviewing the Intellivision version in March 1983, Phil Wiswell wrote in &quot;Video Games&quot; that it was the same game in every aspect as the Atari 2600 version, but criticized the release for not taking advantage enough of Intellivision&#x27;s graphical capabilities. &quot;Electronic Games&quot;, in their &quot;1983 Software Encyclopedia&quot; issue, noted that the game required &quot;more arcade-type skills than intuition or logic&quot;.

&quot;Pitfall!&quot; was the highest-selling video game from late 1982 to the first quarter of 1983. The game sold units in 1982. It held the top spot on the Top Video Games &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for 64 consecutive weeks and went on to sell over units by 1984. It is one of the best-selling games on the Atari 2600, with over four million copies sold . All versions of the game sold over copies worldwide by 1998.

===Retrospective reviews===
Later 1980s reviews continued to praise the game, such as the reviewer for &quot;Computer Games&quot;, who gave the game an A-rating in their 1985 game guide, praising the graphics as &quot;gorgeous and cartoony&quot; and declaring it a &quot;terrific game for action fans&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; (1989) stated that &quot;Pitfall!&quot; was a &quot;bright and cheery game&quot; that offered plenty of long-term gameplay, continuing that the &quot;game style might look a bit crumbly, but the action is a heap of fun&quot;.

Scott Alan Marriott of the online game database AllGame wrote that the variety of threats you encounter on each screen made &quot;Pitfall!&quot; one of the most exciting and best-looking games on the Atari 2600. Brett Alan Weiss included the game in his book &quot;The 100 Greatest Console Video Games 1977–1987&quot; (2014) and criticized that the Atari 5200 version of the game had poor controls and the Intellivision version for requiring a second button for letting go of vines. Weiss found the ColecoVision version designed by Action Graphics to be the best of the three versions with improved visuals over the Atari 2600 game, although it failed to take true advantage of the systems graphic capabilities.

&quot;Pitfall!&quot; has been included in several best-of video games lists from various publications, such as &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot; in 1984, &quot;Flux&quot; (1995) where it placed 33rd, &quot;Game Informer&quot; (2001) where it placed 41st, and &quot;Time&quot; (2012).

==Legacy==

&quot;Pitfall!&quot; was described by authors Montfort and Bogost in &quot;Racing the Beam&quot; as an important early platformer, a game genre made famous by &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985). They wrote that &quot;Pitfall!&quot; was a much longer game than previous Atari VCS games. These other games were often ports of arcade games which were designed to be a short experience to keep the player pay to play, but even native games could be rather short—the easiest difficulty of &quot;Adventure&quot; can be completed in just two minutes. The authors said that &quot;Pitfall!&quot; built upon the graphic adventure game genre of &quot;Adventure&quot; to create an experience similar to later open-world games. According to them, the world was too large to be contemplated all at once, and a few core gameplay mechanics allowed a variety of more complex actions and possibilities. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; spoke similarly in 2004 when including &quot;Pitfall!&quot; in the site&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Games of All Time&quot; list, stating that the game was &quot;responsible for launching the platformer genre as we know it&quot; and that &quot;Despite the fact that platformers have become a lot more sophisticated, especially since video games in general made the shift to 3D, it&#x27;s surprising how little the fundamentals—like jumping around, avoiding enemies and obstacles, and collecting stuff—have changed since &quot;Pitfall!&quot;&quot;

Unlike Mario or Pac-Man, who originated in arcade games, Pitfall Harry was the first popular video game character originating in home consoles. The character was featured on licensed merchandise and appeared on the cartoon show &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot;, which aired from 1983 to 1985 on CBS. Pitfall Harry was dropped for its second season.

===Follow-ups===

&quot;Pitfall!&quot; spawned numerous sequels for consoles. These include &quot;Pitfall II: Lost Caverns&quot; (1984), &quot;Super Pitfall&quot; (1986) for the Nintendo Entertainment System, &quot;&quot; (1994) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis, &quot;Pitfall 3D: Beyond the Jungle&quot; (1998) for the PlayStation, &quot;Pitfall: Beyond the Jungle&quot; (1998) for the Game Boy Color, and &quot;&quot; for various systems in 2004.

Sega released &quot;Pitfall II: Lost Caverns&quot; (1985) to arcades, which incorporated elements of &quot;Pitfall!&quot; and &quot;Pitfall II: Lost Caverns&quot; from the Atari 2600. Activision&#x27;s UK-based studio The Blast Furnace released a follow-up titled &quot;Pitfall!&quot; (2012) for iOS on August 9, 2012. It features gameplay similar to that of &quot;Temple Run&quot; (2011).

&quot;Pitfall!&quot; remained the game that Crane has been most associated with. In 2012, he stated that &quot;I suppose that&#x27;s not a bad problem to have, It&#x27;s not a dark shadow. But I&#x27;m not just a classic gaming guy. This is what I do for a living!&quot; In the same year, he started a crowdfunding campaign Kickstarter to fund a spiritual successor to the &quot;Pitfall!&quot; series, but it fell far short of his funding goal.

<text>Kristina Bernadette Cojuangco Aquino-Yap (; born February 14, 1971) is a Filipino retired television presenter, actress, talent manager and film producer. She notably appeared as Princess Intan in the acclaimed &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot; and is a recipient of 42 PMPC Star Awards for Television, 10 Golden Screen Awards and a FAMAS Award.

Dubbed as Philippine&#x27;s &quot;Queen of All Media&quot;, Aquino has hosted numerous talk shows and game shows starred in several films and television series, and currently making waves in the social media platform. She is the youngest daughter of the late Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. and the late President Corazon Aquino, who served as the 11th President of the Philippines. Her late brother Benigno Aquino III served as the 15th President of the Philippines from 2010 until 2016.

Her debut film appearance was in &quot;Pido Dida: Sabay Tayo&quot; and was also known for her roles in horror films &quot;Feng Shui&quot; and &quot;Sukob&quot;, which was the highest-grossing Filipino film of 2004 and 2006 respectively. She is also widely known as a top celebrity product endorser and a philanthropist who advocates for lupus awareness, children&#x27;s rights, LGBT rights, culture and art appreciation, freedom of expression, and democratic reforms.

==Early life and education==
Kristina Bernadette Cojuangco Aquino was born in Quezon City, Philippines, to Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino and Benigno Aquino Jr. who was, at the time, a senator of the Ferdinand Marcos regime. The youngest of five children, her siblings are Maria Elena &quot;Ballsy&quot; Aquino-Cruz, Aurora Corazon &quot;Pinky&quot; Aquino-Abellada, former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III, and Victoria Elisa &quot;Viel&quot; Aquino-Dee. She is the cousin of actress and equestrienne Mikee Cojuangco, and the niece of former Philippine Olympic Committee president Jose &quot;Peping&quot; Cojuangco Jr. When she was a baby, her father was arrested and jailed; her mother raised Aquino and her siblings.

During the 1978 parliamentary elections when her jailed father was a candidate, the seven-year-old Aquino was a stand-in for him at campaign rallies. She was featured on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and on the cover of &quot;Time Magazine&quot;. Aquino spent most of her elementary school days in the United States, where the Aquino family was in exile. When she was 12 years old, her father was assassinated on the tarmac of Manila International Airport. Kris Aquino returned to the Philippines and attended rallies against the Marcos regime.

After the Philippine Revolution of 1986, which removed Ferdinand Marcos from his 21-year regime, the teenage Aquino began guesting stints on television dramas and comedies, as well as talk shows. She made her film debut with actor-comedian Rene Requiestas in &quot;Pido Dida&quot;, which was a blockbuster hit. Aquino had a commercially steady career, and managed to score an acting nomination for &quot;The Fatima Buen Story&quot;. She starred in a film based on a true-to-life murder, the Vizconde massacre. Its financial success and numerous starring appearances in crime films of the same vein, earned her the nickname &quot;Massacre Queen&quot; by newspaper critics.

Aquino finished her elementary school education at the Poveda Learning Center (now Saint Pedro Poveda College) in Quezon City. She went to high school at the Colegio San Agustin-Makati, where she was batchmates with Pinky Webb and Karen Davila.

==Career==
===Television===
Aquino shifted her sights to a television career as a showbiz talk show host with the launching of the talk show &quot;Kris&quot;. It was produced by Viva Television on the People&#x27;s Television Network. It was on GMA Network&#x27;s showbiz oriented talk show &quot;Startalk&quot;, which she co-hosted with Boy Abunda and Lolit Solis, that her hosting skills attracted attention.

She later joined ABS-CBN as a contract artist and was launched in morning talk show &quot;Today with Kris Aquino&quot;. Following are showbiz-oriented talk show &quot;The Buzz&quot; alongside Boy Abunda and game show &quot;Game KNB?&quot;. From 2002 to 2004, she hosted the talk show &quot;Morning Girls with Kris and Korina&quot; with known broadcast journalist Korina Sanchez.

In 2007, Aquino took a showbiz break leaving &quot;The Buzz&quot; and the reformatted &quot;Pilipinas, Game Ka Na Ba?&quot; where she was replaced by Edu Manzano, when she gave birth to her second son.

Aquino also hosted the Philippine franchise of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, which is part of ABS-CBN&#x27;s primetime lineup, where she also appeared on the US version as part of a &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; &quot;around the world&quot; event which hosted by Howie Mandel in May 2008.

She also hosted &quot;Boy &amp; Kris&quot;, a morning talk show that replaced &quot;Homeboy,&quot; together with Boy Abunda, &quot;Be Bench&quot;, a model search show together with Piolo Pascual, another TV franchise, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, which replaced &quot;Kapamilya, Deal or No Deal&quot; and marks her return on &quot;The Buzz&quot; in 2014.

She later shifted to dramatisations of true crime, including &quot;The Vizconde Massacre Story&quot;, &quot;Myrna Diones Story&quot;, &quot;Elsa Castillo-Ang Katotohanan&quot;, and &quot;Humanda Ka Mayor&quot;.

She won her first supporting actress award in 2002 for &quot;Mano Po&quot;, for her portrayal of a weak-willed and submissive scion of a wealthy Filipino-Chinese clan. In the 2004 film &quot;So... Happy Together&quot; she played opposite Eric Quizon.

Other films include: &quot;Feng Shui&quot;, a Star Cinema production that featured Chinese influences and omen. &quot;Feng Shui&quot;, which was made during the wave of &quot;Asian-style horror&quot; flicks that spread throughout the continent after 2002&#x27;s. &quot;The Ring&quot; made P137 million.

<text>Tuchola (; ) is a town in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship in northern Poland. The Pomeranian town, which is the seat of Tuchola County, had a population of 13,418 .

== Geographical location ==
Tuchola lies about north of Bydgoszcz, close to the Tuchola Forests. Forest areas to the east and north of the town form the protected area of Tuchola Landscape Park.

==History==
Settlement around Tuchola dates from 980, while the town was first mentioned in 1287, when the local church was consecrated by the archbishop of Gniezno Jakub Świnka. It was part of medieval Poland since the establishment of the state in the 10th century, and during its fragmentation it was ruled by the dukes of Gdańsk Pomerania. The place was one of the strongholds of the count of Nowe Peter Swienca, who owned a fortified domicile in the area. In 1330 Tuchola came into possession of the Teutonic Order. It received Chełmno law in 1346 from Heinrich Dusemer, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, although it probably received town rights before, when it was still part of the Kingdom of Poland. At that time, the town already had defensive walls, a castle, a town hall and the Gothic Church of St. Bartholomew.

After the Order&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of Grunwald on July 14, 1410, a Polish-Lithuanian army recaptured the town on November 5, 1410, but the Order regained the town in the First Peace of Thorn in 1411. In 1440 the town joined the Prussian Confederation, which opposed Teutonic rule, and at the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of re-incorporation of the town and region to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. The town became again part of Poland and Poles manned the castle. Tuchola became the seat of the local starosts, the first of which was . During the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War, in 1464, a Polish-Teutonic battle was fought there, ending in a Polish victory. The Teutonic Order renounced claims to the town in the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466. Tuchola was a royal town of the Polish Crown, administratively part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship in the province of Royal Prussia in the larger Greater Poland Province. During the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1660), the town and the castle were besieged by the Swedes five times, but to no avail.

Under the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Tuchola, renamed &quot;Tuchel&quot;, was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. On May 17, 1781, the Church of St. Bartholomew and vast parts of the town burned down. Around 1785 there existed 148 households inside Tuchel, and the town owned both the village of Kiełpin (then &quot;Kelpin&quot;) and the small estate Wymysłowo (then named &quot;Wymislawe&quot;). During the reign of Prussian King Frederick the Great (1740–1786), the town was built up again, and German Protestants obtained a church in the town hall. In the early 19th century, during the Napoleonic Wars and Polish national liberation fights, French, Polish, Prussian and Russian troops were stationed in the town. With the unification of Germany under Prussian hegemony in 1871, it became part of the German Empire. The Polish population was subject to Germanisation policies, which intensified after 1871, however, various Polish organizations were founded in Tuchola in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During World War I, a prisoner-of-war camp was established near the town, mostly for Romanians and Russians, but also Poles, Italians, French and British.

On November 24, 1918, almost two weeks after Poland&#x27;s declaration of independence, a Polish rally was held in Tuchola. In December, local German settlers protested against the creation of independent Poland. Another Polish rally was held on January 12, 1919. The next Polish rallies took place in 1919, and after the Poles celebrated the anniversary of the Constitution of 3 May 1791, the Germans introduced martial law in Tuchola, and searches were carried out in many Polish homes. Following the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, the town was finally reintegrated with the Second Polish Republic in January 1920.

The former German POW camp became known as Camp No. 7. Beginning in the autumn of 1920 during Polish-Soviet war, thousands of captured Red Army men were placed in the camp of Tuchola. These prisoners of war (POWs) lived in crude dugouts, and hunger, cold, and infectious diseases killed many. According to historians Zbigniew Karpus and Waldemar Rezmer, up to 2,000 prisoners died in the camp before it was closed in 1923. These events tend to be used by some Russian historians, publicists and politicians, who falsely claim that 22,000 POWs died in the camp, also as a result of alleged executions, as part of Russian negationist Anti-Katyn propaganda.
During the invasion of Poland, which marked the beginning of World War II, Tuchola was captured by the Germans on September 2, 1939. Along with the rest of the region, was occupied by Nazi Germany. The Einsatzkommando 16 entered the town to commit various crimes against Poles. From mid-September 1939, Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles from the town and county, who were initially imprisoned in the local courthouse, and after its overcrowding, they were deported to a temporary camp established in the nearby village of Radzim. Some Poles were executed in Radzim, but more were murdered in Rudzki Most (present-day district of Tuchola), where Germans carried out large massacres of Poles in October and November 1939, killing several hundreds people. Among Poles massacred in Rudzki Most were teachers, school principals, merchants, craftsmen and local officials from Tuchola, including mayor Stanisław Saganowski, as well as farmers, priests, foresters, postmen, railwaymen, merchants, craftsmen and policemen from nearby villages. After the German defeat, the town reverted to Poland.

<text>Forests cover an estimated 38.5% of Poland&#x27;s territory, and are mostly owned by the state, and are increasing at a fast rate by 2035 Polands forest percentage will be 42-46%. Western and northern parts of Poland as well as the Carpathian Mountains in the extreme south, are much more forested than eastern and central provinces. The most forested administrative districts of the country are: Lubusz Voivodeship (60,2%), Subcarpathian Voivodeship (58,2%), and Pomeranian Voivodeship (50,1%). The least forested are: Łódź Voivodeship (36%), Masovian Voivodeship (34,6%), and Lublin Voivodeship (32,8%).

==History==

=== Medieval history ===
The forests of medieval Poland contributed high quality oak timber to commercial trade throughout the Baltic region. Major trade centers for Polish timber included Danzig and Amsterdam.

=== Contemporary history ===
At the end of the 18th century, forests covered around 40% of Poland. However, due to the 19th century economic exploitation during the partitions of Poland, as well as, the Nazi German and Soviet occupations between 1939–1945 with trees shipped to battle fronts across Europe, deforestation and slash and burn conditions of war shrank Polish forests to only 21% of total area of the country (as of 1946). Furthermore, rich deciduous trees were replaced with fast growing coniferous trees of lesser value meant for commerce, such as pine. After World War II, the government of Poland initiated the National Plan of Afforestation. By 1970, forests covered 29% of the country. As of 2009 – 29,1% of Poland&#x27;s territory was forested, amounting to 9,088,000 hectares. It is estimated that by 2050, the total area of forested land should increase to 33%.

As much as 81,8% of the Polish forests are state-owned, majority (77,8%) by Polish State Forests (Lasy Państwowe), 2% constitute Polish National Forests protected zones, 2% are owned by other governmental entities (such as local self-government or the Agricultural Property Agency) and 18,2% belong to private owners. The high percentage of Polish forests owned by the state is the result of nationalization of forests that occurred in the aftermath of World War II when Poland became a communist state (People&#x27;s Republic of Poland) under the Soviet sphere of influence.

==Inhabitation==
Forest in Poland occupy the poorest soil. Coniferous type accounts for 54.5% (with the absolute dominance of Scots pine - Pinus sylvestris), whereas broadleaved type accounts for 45.5% (out of that, alder and riparian forests account for 3.8%). A number of forested zones are now protected by the Polish government and, in many cases, they have become tourist destinations. Over the years, many of the largest Polish forests have been reduced in size, and that reflected on the structure of forest inhabitation.

Up until the end of the 18th Century, beginning in what is known as the Middle Ages, forests were considered places for travellers and ordinary folk to stay away from, as they were home to bandits and were believed to be inhabited by evil spirits. Law and order did not apply to forests for many centuries, except for self-policing observed and administered by their inhabitants. However, the forests did contain numerous woodsmen and their families who made the best of their remote environment. These woodsmen lived on what the forest could produce, collecting pitch resin for sale – important as method of illuminating city streets – logging construction lumber, collecting lime, beeswax, honey, hops, mushrooms and whatever other saleable items could be harvested in the forest and sold in villages outside of it.

Families of the woodsmen produced their own food through gardening and hunting, as well as their own clothing. In some cases, their sewing of intricate laces became well known outside the forest, resulting in additional family income. Because of their isolation from society in general, woodsmen and their families developed their own style of dress, music, sewing, dialect, celebrations, and the type of dwellings. The Masovia woodsmen for example, known as Kurpie people, who lived in the forested region known in Poland as the White Wilderness (Puszcza Biała) and the Green Wilderness, still proudly proclaim and celebrate their unique culture and customs.

Converse&#x27;s book chapter &quot;The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics&quot; (&quot;Ideology and Discontent&quot;, edited by David E. Apter, 1964) held that most people lack structure and stability in their political views. With Angus Campbell, Warren Miller, and Donald E. Stokes, he co-wrote &quot;The American Voter&quot;, which used data from the American National Election Studies to create a set of surveys of American public opinion carried out by the University of Michigan Survey Research Center and the Center for Political Studies. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969.

== Personal life==
Converse was born November 17, 1928, in Concord, New Hampshire. His sister, Connie was a singer-songwriter who recorded music in the 1950s before disappearing in the 1970s. Philip earned his B.A. in English at Denison University in 1949, and he earned a master&#x27;s degree in English literature from the University of Iowa in 1950. Converse was drafted into U.S. military service during the Korean War, working as a newspaper editor on a base in Battle Creek, Michigan.

In 1961, Converse married social scientist Jean G. McDonnell, an expert in interviewing techniques who directed the Detroit Area Study.

== Academic career ==
Converse studied for a time in France before returning to the United States to earn an M.A. in sociology at the University of Michigan in 1956, followed by a Ph.D. in social psychology at Michigan in 1958. As he began his graduate education, Converse worked as the assistant study director of Michigan&#x27;s Survey Research Center, joining forces with Warren Miller and Angus Campbell to field the 1956–1960 National Election Study panel survey. That work produced his text for political behavior, &quot;The American Voter&quot; (1960). He served in leadership roles for the center and for the broader Institute for Social Research (ISR) in which it was housed for the rest of his career, including as director of the Center for Political Studies (1981–1986) and director of ISR itself (1986–1989).

Converse became an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Michigan in 1960. He quickly earned tenure with promotion to associate professor in 1964. One year later, he was promoted to the rank of full professor in sociology and a joint appointment in political science. After being awarded two named chair positions in the 1970s and 1980s, Converse was selected as the 1987 Henry Russel Lecturer.

Converse left the University of Michigan to become director of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University in 1989. He returned to the University of Michigan as an emeritus professor of sociology and political science in 1994.

Converse died December 30, 2014, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the age of 86. He was survived by his wife, Jean, and his two sons.

== Research ==
Converse is known for his work on ideology and belief systems, voters and elections, partisanship, political representation, party systems, the human meaning of social change, and political sophistication. His work drew on extensive public opinion survey data from the United States and France.

According to Professor Michael Traugott, director of the University of Michigan Center for Political Studies:
:The central point of Phil&#x27;s work was the inability of citizens to deal with large quantities of political information and to make it logically consistent, so they are always faced with making decisions based on inadequate information...Phil’s original research even helps to explain elements of polarization...People have the ability to screen out discordant information, but they haven’t become more sophisticated.

=== &quot;The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics&quot; (1964) ===
In &quot;The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics&quot;, Converse challenged the notion that ordinary citizens share the sophisticated ideological structure in political thinking seen among political elites. He argues first that belief systems are ultimately about &quot;constraint&quot;—if one&#x27;s view changes on an issue central to the belief system, that change shifts attitudes throughout the network of other views when constraint is high. In contrast, other views do not change in a low-constraint belief system when another attitude changes. Converse says belief systems are constructed by political elites, who decide the issue views that go together, and he says political information is key for determining whether members of the mass public are capable of following these connections in their own thinking.

Next, Converse empirically analyzes belief systems in the mass public using survey data from 1956, 1958, and 1960 American National Election Studies. He proceeds in four parts. In the first section, he shows that, when asked to describe their views on the political parties and candidates, very few Americans rely on abstract principles (possibly a liberal-conservative continuum) or other signs of ideological thinking (&quot;ideologues&quot;). In a second category, labeled &quot;near-ideologue&quot;, Converse groups people that peripherally mention some abstract principles used to guide their decisions, but they may not have placed much evaluative dependence on the principle or showed evidence of misunderstanding. Using the idea of a yardstick as a model, Converse explains that an ideologue would explicitly reference the yardstick when explaining their reasoning, while a &quot;near-ideologue&quot; may imply the existence of a yardstick, but could use it incorrectly or show obvious misunderstanding. Instead, the largest category of people think about politics and parties in terms of &quot;group benefits&quot; based on which prominent social groups they see as advantaged or disadvantaged by Democrats or Republicans. These social group ties tend to be stronger and more prominent when the groups are considered &quot;visible&quot;, such as a church, union, or race, as opposed to an &quot;invisible&quot; social group, like social class. It is important for the masses to be cognizant of their group to see this &quot;group benefits&quot; category appear. Others thought about parties based on the &quot;nature of the times&quot; (issue- or party-driven) or &quot;no issue content.&quot; In sum, regular people don&#x27;t talk about politics in ideological ways.

In the second section, Converse shows that when Americans are asked explicitly to explain the terms &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative,&quot; many struggle to link those terms to the political parties and to give meaningful reasons for those pairings. This suggests a lack of ideological understanding and again pushed against the notion of an ideological public. Converse gives an example using the following statement- &quot;Even though it may hurt the position of the Negro in the South, state governments should be able to decide who can vote and who cannot&quot;. While this statement may seem to be focused on the rights of African Americans for most Americans, it is truly about state versus federal rights. This lack of understanding supports Converse&#x27;s view of a non-ideological public. In the third section, Converse presents evidence that issue preferences in the public show low constraint, as seen in low correlations between issue pairs. This stands in contrast to relatively high constraint observed in the views of political elites. Finally, Converse shows that political attitudes are highly unstable in the mass public over time. On some issues, the public provides such inconsistent responses over two and four years that they appear to be responding almost as if at random. While this trend is evident with the general public/masses, it is not evident with the elite group. If ordinary people had idiosyncratic belief systems, he argues their views would be stable over time. The instability he observes is the final strike against the notion of an ideologically sophisticated public.

Converse concludes that mass publics generally lack the structured belief systems seen in political elites, and he speculates that this finding from mid-century America applies broadly across publics in other places and eras. Converse summarizes by stating that the mass public has a very narrow understanding of political issue and vote accordingly, thus explaining the instability of voting trends among the masses versus the elites. 

In a 1970 essay, Converse calls these highly unstable political views &quot;non-attitudes.&quot;

Converse&#x27;s book &quot;Political Representation in France&quot; with Roy Pierce on mass politics in France draws similar conclusions about belief systems.

=== &quot;The American Voter&quot; (1960) ===
Converse also co-authored &quot;The American Voter&quot; with Angus Campbell, Warren Miller, and Donald Stokes. One of the book&#x27;s primary contributions was the introduction of the social-psychological concept of partisan identity and investigations into its effects on political behavior. Partisanship, they say, functions more as an attachment to a social group than as a mere summary of political values and attitudes, and it is the fundamental driver in vote choice and much else. This theory became known as the Michigan Model. They also find that citizens who choose not to identify with a political party are generally disengaged from politics and low in political knowledge, in contrast to idealized views celebrating the independent voter. Evidence for the book was drawn from analysis of the 1956–1968 National Election Studies panel. &quot;The American Voter&quot; also assesses factors that influence voter turnout, the influence of electoral rules, effects from social and economic conditions, the roles of group identity and socio-economic position, and it introduces some of the initial analysis that underlies Converse&#x27;s 1964 &quot;Nature of Belief Systems&quot; essay. The book also introduces other concepts like the &quot;funnel of causality&quot; modeling the long-term and short-term forces leading eventually to an individual&#x27;s vote, and the &quot;normal vote&quot; model relating partisanship and turnout in election outcomes.

<doc id="445637" wikidata="Q455003" url="?curid=445637" title="Reflection high-energy electron diffraction">
<text>Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is a technique used to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. RHEED systems gather information only from the surface layer of the sample, which distinguishes RHEED from other materials characterization methods that also rely on diffraction of high-energy electrons. Transmission electron microscopy, another common electron diffraction method samples mainly the bulk of the sample due to the geometry of the system, although in special cases it can provide surface information. Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is also surface sensitive, but LEED achieves surface sensitivity through the use of low energy electrons.

==Introduction==

A RHEED system requires an electron source (gun), photoluminescent detector screen and a sample with a clean surface, although modern RHEED systems have additional parts to optimize the technique. The electron gun generates a beam of electrons which strike the sample at a very small angle relative to the sample surface. Incident electrons diffract from atoms at the surface of the sample, and a small fraction of the diffracted electrons interfere constructively at specific angles and form regular patterns on the detector. The electrons interfere according to the position of atoms on the sample surface, so the diffraction pattern at the detector is a function of the sample surface. Figure 1 shows the most basic setup of a RHEED system.

==Surface diffraction==

In the RHEED setup, only atoms at the sample surface contribute to the RHEED pattern. The glancing angle of incident electrons allows them to escape the bulk of the sample and to reach the detector. Atoms at the sample surface diffract (scatter) the incident electrons due to the wavelike properties of electrons.

The diffracted electrons interfere constructively at specific angles according to the crystal structure and spacing of the atoms at the sample surface and the wavelength of the incident electrons. Some of the electron waves created by constructive interference collide with the detector, creating specific diffraction patterns according to the surface features of the sample. Users characterize the crystallography of the sample surface through analysis of the diffraction patterns. Figure 2 shows a RHEED pattern. Video 1 depicts a metrology instrument recording the RHEED intensity oscillations and deposition rate for process control and analysis. 

Two types of diffraction contribute to RHEED patterns. Some incident electrons undergo a single, elastic scattering event at the crystal surface, a process termed kinematic scattering. Dynamic scattering occurs when electrons undergo multiple diffraction events in the crystal and lose some of their energy due to interactions with the sample. Users extract non-qualitative data from the kinematically diffracted electrons. These electrons account for the high intensity spots or rings common to RHEED patterns. RHEED users also analyze dynamically scattered electrons with complex techniques and models to gather quantitative information from RHEED patterns.

===Kinematic scattering analysis===
RHEED users construct Ewald&#x27;s spheres to find the crystallographic properties of the sample surface. Ewald&#x27;s spheres show the allowed diffraction conditions for kinematically scattered electrons in a given RHEED setup. The diffraction pattern at the screen relates to the Ewald&#x27;s sphere geometry, so RHEED users can directly calculate the reciprocal lattice of the sample with a RHEED pattern, the energy of the incident electrons and the distance from the detector to the sample. The user must relate the geometry and spacing of the spots of a perfect pattern to the Ewald&#x27;s sphere in order to determine the reciprocal lattice of the sample surface.

The Ewald&#x27;s sphere analysis is similar to that for bulk crystals, however the reciprocal lattice for the sample differs from that for a 3D material due to the surface sensitivity of the RHEED process. The reciprocal lattices of bulk crystals consist of a set of points in 3D space. However, only the first few layers of the material contribute to the diffraction in RHEED, so there are no diffraction conditions in the dimension perpendicular to the sample surface. Due to the lack of a third diffracting condition, the reciprocal lattice of a crystal surface is a series of infinite rods extending perpendicular to the sample&#x27;s surface. These rods originate at the conventional 2D reciprocal lattice points of the sample&#x27;s surface.

The Ewald&#x27;s sphere is centered on the sample surface with a radius equal to the magnitude of the wavevector of the incident electrons,

where λ is the electrons&#x27; de Broglie wavelength.

Diffraction conditions are satisfied where the rods of reciprocal lattice intersect the Ewald&#x27;s sphere. Therefore, the magnitude of a vector from the origin of the Ewald&#x27;s sphere to the intersection of any reciprocal lattice rods is equal in magnitude to that of the incident beam. This is expressed as

formula_1 (2)

Here, khl is the wave vector of the elastically diffracted electrons of the order (hl) at any intersection of reciprocal lattice rods with Ewald&#x27;s sphere

The projections of the two vectors onto the plane of the sample&#x27;s surface differ by a reciprocal lattice vector Ghl,

formula_2 (3)

Figure 3 shows the construction of the Ewald&#x27;s sphere and provides examples of the G, khl and ki vectors.

Many of the reciprocal lattice rods meet the diffraction condition, however the RHEED system is designed such that only the low orders of diffraction are incident on the detector. The RHEED pattern at the detector is a projection only of the k vectors that are within the angular range that contains the detector. The size and position of the detector determine which of the diffracted electrons are within the angular range that reaches the detector, so the geometry of the RHEED pattern can be related back to the geometry of the reciprocal lattice of the sample surface through use of trigonometric relations and the distance from the sample to detector.

The k vectors are labeled such that the vector k00 that forms the smallest angle with the sample surface is called the 0th order beam. The 0th order beam is also known as the specular beam. Each successive intersection of a rod and the sphere further from the sample surface is labeled as a higher order reflection. 
Because of the way the center of the Ewald&#x27;s sphere is positioned, the specular beam forms the same angle with the substrate as the incident electron beam. The specular point has the greatest intensity on a RHEED pattern and is labeled as the (00) point by convention. The other points on the RHEED pattern are indexed according to the reflection order they project.

The radius of the Ewald&#x27;s sphere is much larger than the spacing between reciprocal lattice rods because the incident beam has a very short wavelength due to its high-energy electrons. Rows of reciprocal lattice rods actually intersect the Ewald&#x27;s sphere as an approximate plane because identical rows of parallel reciprocal lattice rods sit directly in front and behind the single row shown. Figure 3 shows a cross sectional view of a single row of reciprocal lattice rods filling of the diffraction conditions. The reciprocal lattice rods in Figure 3 show the end on view of these planes, which are perpendicular to the computer screen in the figure.

The intersections of these effective planes with the Ewald&#x27;s sphere forms circles, called Laue circles. The RHEED pattern is a collection of points on the perimeters of concentric Laue circles around the center point. However, interference effects between the diffracted electrons still yield strong intensities at single points on each Laue circle. Figure 4 shows the intersection of one of these planes with the Ewald&#x27;s Sphere.

The azimuthal angle affects the geometry and intensity of RHEED patterns. The azimuthal angle is the angle at which the incident electrons intersect the ordered crystal lattice on the surface of the sample. Most RHEED systems are equipped with a sample holder that can rotate the crystal around an axis perpendicular to the sample surface. RHEED users rotate the sample to optimize the intensity profiles of patterns. Users generally index at least 2 RHEED scans at different azimuth angles for reliable characterization of the crystal&#x27;s surface structure. Figure 5 shows a schematic diagram of an electron beam incident on the sample at different azimuth angles.

Users sometimes rotate the sample around an axis perpendicular to the sampling surface during RHEED experiments to create a RHEED pattern called the azimuthal plot. Rotating the sample changes the intensity of the diffracted beams due to their dependence on the azimuth angle. RHEED specialists characterize film morphologies by measuring the changes in beam intensity and comparing these changes to theoretical calculations, which can effectively model the dependence of the intensity of diffracted beams on the azimuth angle.

===Dynamic scattering analysis===

The dynamically, or inelastically, scattered electrons provide several types of information about the sample as well. The brightness or intensity at a point on the detector depends on dynamic scattering, so all analysis involving the intensity must account for dynamic scattering. Some inelastically scattered electrons penetrate the bulk crystal and fulfill Bragg diffraction conditions. These inelastically scattered electrons can reach the detector to yield Kikuchi diffraction patterns, which are useful for calculating diffraction conditions. Kikuchi patterns are characterized by lines connecting the intense diffraction points on a RHEED pattern. Figure 6 shows a RHEED pattern with visible Kikuchi lines.

==RHEED system requirements==

===Electron gun===

The electron gun is one of the most important piece of equipment in a RHEED system. The gun limits the resolution and testing limits of the system. Tungsten filaments are the primary electron source for the electron gun of most RHEED systems due to the low work function of tungsten. In the typical setup, the tungsten filament is the cathode and a positively biased anode draws electrons from the tip of the tungsten filament.

The magnitude of the anode bias determines the energy of the incident electrons. The optimal anode bias is dependent upon the type of information desired. At large incident angles, electrons with high energy can penetrate the surface of the sample and degrade the surface sensitivity of the instrument. However, the dimensions of the Laue zones are proportional to the inverse square of the electron energy meaning that more information is recorded at the detector at higher incident electron energies. For general surface characterization, the electron gun is operated the range of 10-30 keV.

In a typical RHEED setup, one magnetic and one electric field focus the incident beam of electrons. A negatively biased Wehnelt electrode positioned between the cathode filament and anode applies a small electric field, which focuses the electrons as they pass through the anode. An adjustable magnetic lens focuses the electrons onto the sample surface after they pass through the anode. A typical RHEED source has a focal length around 50 cm. The beam is focused to the smallest possible point at the detector rather than the sample surface so that the diffraction pattern has the best resolution.

Phosphor screens that exhibit photoluminescence are widely used as detectors. These detectors emit green light from areas where electrons hit their surface and are common to TEM as well. The detector screen is useful for aligning the pattern to an optimal position and intensity. CCD cameras capture the patterns to allow for digital analysis.

===Sample surface===

The sample surface must be extremely clean for effective RHEED experiments. Contaminants on the sample surface interfere with the electron beam and degrade the quality of the RHEED pattern. RHEED users employ two main techniques to create clean sample surfaces. Small samples can be cleaved in the vacuum chamber prior to RHEED analysis. The newly exposed, cleaved surface is analyzed. Large samples, or those that are not able to be cleaved prior to RHEED analysis can be coated with a passive oxide layer prior to analysis. Subsequent heat treatment under the vacuum of the RHEED chamber removes the oxide layer and exposes the clean sample surface.

===Vacuum requirements===

Because gas molecules diffract electrons and affect the quality of the electron gun, RHEED experiments are performed under vacuum. The RHEED system must operate at a pressure low enough to prevent significant scattering of the electron beams by gas molecules in the chamber. At electron energies of 10 keV, a chamber pressure of 10−5 mbar or lower is necessary to prevent significant scattering of electrons by the background gas. In practice, RHEED systems are operated under ultra high vacuums. The chamber pressure is minimized as much as possible in order to optimize the process. The vacuum conditions limit the types of materials and processes that can be monitored in situ with RHEED.

==RHEED patterns of real surfaces==

Previous analysis focused only on diffraction from a perfectly flat surface of a crystal surface. However, non-flat surfaces add additional diffraction conditions to RHEED analysis.

Streaked or elongated spots are common to RHEED patterns. As Fig 3 shows, the reciprocal lattice rods with the lowest orders intersect the Ewald sphere at very small angles, so the intersection between the rods and sphere is not a singular point if the sphere and rods have thickness. The incident electron beam diverges and electrons in the beam have a range of energies, so in practice, the Ewald sphere is not infinitely thin as it is theoretically modeled. The reciprocal lattice rods have a finite thickness as well, with their diameters dependent on the quality of the sample surface. Streaks appear in the place of perfect points when broadened rods intersect the Ewald sphere. Diffraction conditions are fulfilled over the entire intersection of the rods with the sphere, yielding elongated points or ‘streaks’ along the vertical axis of the RHEED pattern. In real cases, streaky RHEED patterns indicate a flat sample surface while the broadening of the streaks indicate small area of coherence on the surface.

Surface features and polycrystalline surfaces add complexity or change RHEED patterns from those from perfectly flat surfaces. Growing films, nucleating particles, crystal twinning, grains of varying size and adsorbed species add complicated diffraction conditions to those of a perfect surface. Superimposed patterns of the substrate and heterogeneous materials, complex interference patterns and degradation of the resolution are characteristic of complex surfaces or those partially covered with heterogeneous materials.

==Specialized RHEED techniques==

===Film growth===

RHEED is an extremely popular technique for monitoring the growth of thin films. In particular, RHEED is well suited for use with molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), a process used to form high quality, ultrapure thin films under ultrahigh vacuum growth conditions. The intensities of individual spots on the RHEED pattern fluctuate in a periodic manner as a result of the relative surface coverage of the growing thin film. Figure 8 shows an example of the intensity fluctuating at a single RHEED point during MBE growth.

Each full period corresponds to formation of a single atomic layer thin film. The oscillation period is highly dependent on the material system, electron energy and incident angle, so researchers obtain empirical data to correlate the intensity oscillations and film coverage before using RHEED for monitoring film growth.

Video 1 depicts a metrology instrument recording the RHEED intensity oscillations and deposition rate for process control and analysis. 

===RHEED-TRAXS===
Reflection high energy electron diffraction - total reflection angle X-ray spectroscopy is a technique for monitoring the chemical composition of crystals. RHEED-TRAXS analyzes X-ray spectral lines emitted from a crystal as a result of electrons from a RHEED gun colliding with the surface.

RHEED-TRAXS is preferential to X-ray microanalysis (XMA)(such as EDS and WDS) because the incidence angle of the electrons on the surface is very small, typically less than 5°. As a result, the electrons do not penetrate deeply into the crystal, meaning the X-ray emission is restricted to the top of the crystal, allowing for real-time, in-situ monitoring of surface stoichiometry.

The experimental setup is fairly simple. Electrons are fired onto a sample causing X-ray emission. These X-rays are then detected using a silicon-lithium Si-Li crystal placed behind beryllium windows, used to maintain vacuum.

===MCP-RHEED===
MCP-RHEED is a system in which an electron beam is amplified by a micro-channel plate (MCP). This system consists of an electron gun and an MCP equipped with a fluorescent screen opposite to the electron gun. Because of the amplification, the intensity of the electron beam can be decreased by several orders of magnitude and the damage to the samples is diminished. This method is used to observe the growth of insulator crystals such as organic films and alkali halide films, which are easily damaged by electron beams.

<text>In political science, a principle-policy puzzle, also known as a principle-policy gap or a principle-policy paradox is a disconnect between support for a principle and support for a policy supporting that principle.

The primary example is the apparent inconsistency between American support of the principle of racial equality, and lack of support of a policy intended to achieve racial equality, especially among those most politically aware. The seeming paradox is explained by noting that lack of support for affirmative action comes from conservative ideology, such that opponents of government policies intended to realize racial equality are not necessarily hypocrites. Individuals may also agree with the principle but feel that the policies do not actually help to achieve the stated principle. Racial resentment has also been suggested as a major contributor to the puzzle.

A more global example is the strong international desire for a clean and health environment compared to the lack of enthusiasm for the type of regulations and taxes that would be needed to achieve this.

<text>The Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands (), sometimes Jansenist Church of Holland, is an Old Catholic jurisdiction originating from the Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580). The Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands is the mother church of the Old Catholic Union of Utrecht.

With approximately 10,000 members, the jurisdiction is currently led by Archbishop Metropolitan Bernd Wallet.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
St. Willibrord evangelised the northern parts of the Netherlands (above the Rhine), bringing Roman Catholicism in the 7th century. The southern parts of the now so-called Benelux were already evangelised from the 4th century, beginning with St. Servatius, Bishop of Maastricht. Willibrord had been consecrated by Pope Sergius I in circa 696 in Rome.

In 1145, Pope Eugene III restricted the electorate to the chapters of the five collegiate churches in the diocese. The Fourth Lateran Council confirmed this in 1215. In 1517, Pope Leo X prohibited, in &#x27;, the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, Hermann of Wied, as &#x27;, to summon to a court of first instance in Cologne, Philip of Burgundy, his treasurer, and his ecclesiastical and secular subjects. John Mason Neale explained that Leo X only confirmed a right of the church but Leo X&#x27;s confirmation &quot;was providential&quot; in respect to the future schism.

=== Reformation and Jansenism ===

Forced into hiding as a result of the Protestant Reformation, the diocesan structures of the Catholic Church of the Netherlands were dissolved. The Holland Mission started when Pope Clement VIII erected the Apostolic Vicariate of Batavia in 1592.

The Jesuits accused Archbishop Petrus Codde, apostolic vicar, of Jansenism. Pope Innocent XII appointed a commission of cardinals who started an investigation of Codde, ending in exoneration. In 1700, Codde was summoned to Rome and brought before a second commission appointed by Pope Clement XI. When Codde refused assent to the &quot;Formula of Submission for the Jansenists&quot;, Clement XI suspended Codde in 1701 and appointed a successor, , as apostolic vicar.

Although the historic archdiocese was suppressed in 1580, and its replacement, the apostolic vicariate, was erected in 1592, the chapter of the suppressed archdiocese arranged for Luke Fagan, Bishop of Meath, to ordain priests for the suppressed archdiocese in 1716.

Finally in 1723, dissatisfied Dutch clergy elected as archbishop of the suppressed Archdiocese of Utrecht. He was consecrated in 1724 without a papal mandate by suspended Bishop Dominique Marie Varlet, who had been living in Amsterdam since 1721. Both Varlet and Steenoven were suspended for illicit episcopal consecration, and excommunicated for claiming a diocesan see of jurisdiction without the permission of the Roman Pontiff. Varlet later reconciled with the Catholic Church, but subsequently consecrated, again without a papal mandate, three more bishops for the independent Ultrajectine church, which would later become known as &quot;Old Catholic&quot; after 1853. Among the three bishops was Petrus Johannes Meindaerts who consecrated several other bishops, becoming the source of apostolic succession for all Old Catholic bishops, after he was consecrated by Varlet in 1739 which had no papal mandate.

The apostolic vicariate was reduced to a mission &quot;sui iuris&quot; by Pope Benedict XIII in 1727.

In 1853, under the reestablished episcopal hierarchy in the Netherlands, Catholics were permitted to worship publicly after two and a half centuries of secret and private religious worship. After reestablishment of the episcopal hierarchy in the Netherlands in 1853 by Pope Pius IX, the breakaway Church of Utrecht adopted the name &quot;Old Catholic Church&quot; to distinguish itself from the newly created Roman hierarchy by its seniority in the Netherlands.

=== Vatican I ===
In 1870 the First Vatican Council was convened, and the bishops of the Church of Utrecht were not invited because they were not seen as being in communion with the Holy See. At the First Vatican Council, papal supremacy in jurisdiction and the Catholic dogma of papal infallibility were defined.

Several separate communities were formed at this time and sought apostolic succession from the Old Catholic Archbishop of Utrecht, eventually forming the Union of Utrecht of the Old Catholic Churches, and these German speaking communities adopted the name &quot;Old Catholic&quot;. The schism was able to continue.

== Doctrine ==
Old Catholics believe they preserve ancient Catholic doctrine through adherence to the &quot;ancient Catholic faith&quot;. Their practice of private confession has fallen into disuse in most areas. Since 1878, Old Catholic clergy have been allowed to marry at any time. It would also seem that, by the beginning of the 20th century, the Eucharistic fast had been abandoned, along with practice of Eucharistic Adoration, and the veneration of the saints.

== Old Catholic Archbishops of Utrecht ==

The Metropolitan Archbishop of Utrecht (not to be confused with the Catholic prelate who holds the same title) is the leader of the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands, and chairman of its governing bodies.

The current archbishop is Bernd Wallet.

<doc id="445643" wikidata="Q1023993" url="?curid=445643" title="COMDEX">
<text>COMDEX (an abbreviation of COMputer Dealers&#x27; EXhibition) was a computer expo trade show held in the Las Vegas Valley of Nevada, United States, each November from 1979 to 2003. It was one of the largest computer trade shows in the world, usually second only to the German CeBIT, and one of the largest trade shows in any industry sector. COMDEX exhibitions were held in many other countries from 1982 to 2005, with 185 shows altogether. The first COMDEX was held in 1979 at the MGM Grand (now Horseshoe), with 167 exhibitors and 3,904 attendees. In 1981, the first COMDEX/Spring was held in New York City.

==History==

===Organizers===
====The Interface Group====
COMDEX was started by The Interface Group, whose organizers included Sheldon Adelson, and Richard Katzeff. In 1995, they sold the show to the Japanese technology conglomerate Softbank Corp. In 2001, Softbank sold the show to Key3Media, a spin-off of Ziff Davis. After entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 2003, Key3Media resurfaced as Medialive International with a cash infusion from Thomas Weisel Capital Partners, which had previously invested in the company. In November 2006, Forbes magazine reported that United Business Media PLC had purchased the events assets of MediaLive International Inc.

====Northeast Computer Faire====
Personal Computer Faire in San Francisco, the Northeast Computer Faire in Boston, and Southern California Computer Faire were presented by Computer Faire Inc., Newton, Mass., a subsidiary of Prentice-Hall.

&quot;Northeast Computer Faire&quot; 1988 was presented by The Interface Group and Boston Computer Society in Boston.

===Attendance===
COMDEX was initially restricted to those directly involved in the computer industry. It was the one show where all levels of manufacturers and developers of computers, peripherals, software, components, and accessories met with distributors, retailers, consultants and their competitors.

Colloquially known as &quot;Geek Week&quot;, COMDEX evolved into a major technical convention, with the industry making major product announcements and releases there. Numerous small companies from around the world rose to prominence following appearance at COMDEX, and industry leaders sought opportunities to make keynote addresses. They discussed the computer industry, history, trends and future potential. The first COMDEX Conference, attracted 4000 paying attendees and grew to over 100,000, becoming a launch platform for key technologies. Bluetooth and USB had conference programming and associated exhibition floor pavilions to help these technologies and start up companies be seen in such a large event and marketplace. In 1982, Microsoft founder Bill Gates attended the conference and saw a demonstration of VisiCorp&#x27;s Visi On, a GUI software suite for IBM PC compatible computers. The development of Windows 1.0 began soon thereafter. In 1999, Linus Torvalds attended the exhibition to talk about the Linux family of operating system. A Linux conference and exhibition hall was a co-located event, helping elevate the open source products.

In the late 1980s, COMDEX was opened to the general public, causing an explosion in attendance, but diluting COMDEX&#x27;s wholesale industry focus. Retailers and consultants complained that &#x27;leading edge&#x27; customers, upon whom they relied for early adoption of new technology, were buying products at &#x27;show specials&#x27; and then expecting the dealers to support those products. . The broadening of audience criteria came about as IT departments decentralized and purchasing of technology products shifted from a central corporate IT budget to departments and company divisions, mirroring the shift from mainframes to decentralized networks and local area networking, and later the Internet as the corporate backbone.

===Cities other than Las Vegas===
After the Spring 1981 show in New York City and 1982 in Atlantic City, COMDEX began regular spring shows in Atlanta, Georgia from 1983 through 1988. Then alternated sites between Atlanta and Chicago. The final Atlanta Spring COMDEX was held in 1997; the last Spring COMDEX was planned for Chicago in April 2003 but cancelled.

The first COMDEX show outside the US was held in Amsterdam 1982. In the record years 1998 and 2000, 21 exhibitions were arranged yearly all over the world: Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and other parts of America. 69% of the 185 shows took place outside the US. Even when the US shows were cancelled, they kept on for a short time, e.g. Gothenburg and São Paulo 2004 and the last in Athens in November 2005. The decline occurred globally: the 2000 show in Basel with 1400 exhibitors drew 79000 attendees, but 2001 17% less.

===Early 2000s and closing===
Following COMDEX Fall 1999 (in Las Vegas), organizers made major changes to their criteria for admission of mass media, adjusting criteria to accommodate bloggers with significant market reach, but also restricting simple and open access to anyone declaring themselves &#x27;media&#x27;. It offered regular public attendance for the general public.

In 2000, major companies such as IBM, Apple, and Compaq (now merged with Hewlett-Packard) decided to discontinue their involvement with COMDEX to allocate resources more efficiently, usually through their own corporate events or other direct-to-consumer selling (Apple Stores), and the bursting of the dot-com bubble caused a decline on the IT market. To reduce costs following the market downturns after the 9/11 attacks many would-be exhibitors stopped renting out or scaled back official COMDEX booths on the convention center floors, and set up invitation-only suites in various Las Vegas hotels. This also allowed exhibitors to concentrate their efforts on industry attendees rather than the general public.

COMDEX/Fall 2001 organizers at Los Angeles-based Key3Media Group Inc. said they expected attendance to fall from the previous year&#x27;s 200,000 to 150,000. They also expected the number of exhibitors to decline from 2,350 to 2,000 and the square footage of exhibitor space to slide from just over 1 million to 750,000.

The last Las Vegas show in November 2003 attracted only 500 exhibitors and 40,000 visitors.

In June 2004, COMDEX cancelled the 2004 exhibition in Las Vegas, effectively making the Consumer Electronics Show its replacement in Las Vegas. By 2004 the personal computer had become a commodity item priced at levels individual departments and consumers overall could buy without needing much corporate oversight, so &quot;computers&quot; became just one of many products in the consumer electronics channels and the Consumer Electronics Show.

==COMDEXvirtual==
A COMDEX event originally designed to exist only on the internet without a physical meeting location. It was announced to commence during November 16–17, 2010. The COMDEX website (www.comdex.com) was operated by TechWeb, a United Business Media company.

Everything Channel and sister company UBM studios (both United Business Media Companies) partnered to deliver COMDEXvirtual (www.comdexvirtual.com) to the global IT channel community in November 2010. Nearly 5,000 attended the event over the course of the two days, making COMDEXvirtual the largest independent virtual tradeshow in the IT industry. The agenda featured more than 100 speakers and nearly 50 sessions on topics ranging from cloud to mobility and virtualization, to address the event&#x27;s theme—New Business Solutions: Embracing Disruptive Technologies &amp; Changing Delivery Models. In addition to educational sessions, there was also an Expo Hall with nearly 30 exhibitors including IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Symantec, Panasonic, and D&amp;H. COMDEXvirtual (www.comdexvirtual.com) 2010 was available on-demand through May 17, 2011. The event returned on November 15 and 16, 2011, with 4,300 attendees, and ultimately in 2012.

<text>The Hertford Union Canal or Duckett&#x27;s Cut, just over long, connects the Regent&#x27;s Canal to the Lee Navigation in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in East London. It was opened in 1830 but quickly proved to be a commercial failure. It was acquired by the Regents Canal Company in 1857, and became part of the Grand Union Canal in 1927.

==History==
Like its 1766 predecessor, the Limehouse Cut, the Hertford Union Canal was intended to provide a short-cut between the River Thames and the River Lee Navigation. It allowed traffic on the Lea heading for the Thames to bypass the tidal, tortuous and often silted Bow Back Rivers of the Lea via a short stretch of the Regent&#x27;s Canal, and provided a short-cut from the Lea to places west along the Regent&#x27;s Canal.
The canal was promoted by Sir George Duckett who succeeded in obtaining an act of Parliament, the (5 Geo. 4. c. xlvii), that gained its royal assent on 17 May 1824. The act was entitled &quot;An Act for making and maintaining a navigable Canal from the River Lee Navigation, in the parish of St. Mary Stratford Bow, in the county of Middlesex, to join the Regent&#x27;s Canal at or near a Place called Old Ford Lock, in the parish of St. Matthew Bethnal Green, in the said county of Middlesex.&quot; The Act authorised Duckett to borrow up to £50,000 to fund construction, and to charge tolls for using the canal, initially one shilling (£0.05) per ton of goods carried.

With Francis Giles appointed as engineer, the canal opened in 1830 and was for some years known as Duckett&#x27;s Canal or Duckett&#x27;s cut (or passage). It was not a commercial success, and within a year offers to waive the tolls were being made. For several years around the 1850s it was unnavigable, as a dam was built across it to prevent the Regent&#x27;s Canal losing water to it. After failed attempts to sell it in 1851, it was eventually acquired by the Regent&#x27;s Canal Company and became a branch of that canal on 28 October 1857. The new owners removed the dam, and deepened and widened the channel. When the Grand Union Canal Company came into existence on 1 January 1929, it became part of that network. Today, it is maintained by the Canal &amp; River Trust.

==Route==
The canal starts at Hertford Union Junction between Mile End Lock and Old Ford Lock on the Regent&#x27;s Canal. It passes along the north of Bow Wharf, redeveloped in the 1990s with shops and bars, and after Grove Road, passes south of Lakeview Estate, completed in 1958. For much of the rest of its route it is bounded on the north by Victoria Park. The canal joins the Lee Navigation just above Old Ford Lock.

Many of the associated locks, bridges and other features around the canal date from the canal&#x27;s opening in 1830, and are designated listed structures within a scheduled monument.

==Locks==


The locks on this canal have been collectively named Old Ford Three Locks, all lying within the district of Old Ford, but are now individually known as Hertford Union Top, Middle and Bottom locks. They are grouped together towards the north-eastern end, and descend approximately from the Regent&#x27;s Canal to the Lee Navigation. They are all single manual locks, and the largest craft that can use them have a length of 72 feet and a beam of 14 feet.

Proceeding west to east, the locks are:

===Hertford Union Top Lock No. 1===
This is lock No.1, and is from the Hertford Union Junction with the Regent&#x27;s Canal. It is to the south of Victoria Park, with the tail of the lock passing beneath a cast iron footbridge accessing the park from Parnell Road. It has a fall of .

The lock was designated a Grade II listed structure in 1990, and its bottom gates have rare cast iron balance beams. One of the adjacent cottages (No 3 Lock Cottages) is also a Grade II listed building.
===Hertford Union Middle Lock No. 2===
The middle lock has a fall of The tail of the lock passes under Cadogan Terrace.
===Hertford Union Bottom Lock No. 3===
The lower lock has a fall of . It is just from the junction with the River Lee.

A now demolished public house, The Mitford Castle, by the ramp to the canal, on Wick Road, was where Thomas Briggs – the first victim of a railway murder – was taken to die from his wounds, in July 1864 (see Hackney Wick).
==Transport==
The nearest London Overground stations are Cambridge Heath at the western end or Hackney Wick at the eastern end.

The canal towpath is open to walkers and cyclists, without permit. At its eastern end, the towpath joins the Lea Valley Walk. At Hackney Wick, the Capital Ring crosses the canal; with section 13 proceeding north-west toward Stoke Newington and section 14, south-east via The Greenway towards Beckton District Park. The towpath forms part of the &quot;Limehouse Circuit&quot; commencing at Limehouse Basin and utilising the Limehouse Cut, Lee Navigation, Regent&#x27;s Canal and Hertford Union in a circular five-mile walk.

The Olympic Park was constructed to the east of the Lee Navigation. During the games, the Cut was closed to navigation and used for mooring visiting craft. In the legacy phase of the 2012 Summer Olympics, there is promised access to the Olympic Park and Bow Back Rivers.

<text>The Lee Navigation is a canalised river incorporating the River Lea (also called the River Lee along the sections that are navigable). It flows from Hertford Castle Weir to the River Thames at Bow Creek; its first lock is Hertford Lock and its last Bow Locks.

== Name ==
The Lee Navigation is named by acts of Parliament and is so marked on Ordnance Survey maps. Constructed elements and human features are spelled Lee, such as the canal system and Lee Valley Park. The un-canalized river is spelled Lea, along with other natural features such as Lower Lea Valley.

== History ==
The River Lea is a major tributary of the River Thames. It has a long association with navigation, as the marshes of Walthamstow have produced a dugout canoe from the Bronze Age and parts of a Saxon barge. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the river was used by Viking raiders, and King Alfred changed the level of the river to strand Guthrum and his fleet. In more peaceful times, it became important for the transport of grain from Hertfordshire, but navigation of its southernmost tidal reaches of Bow Creek were difficult due to its tortuous meanders.

There is documentary evidence that the river was altered by the Abbot of Waltham to improve navigation in 1190, and in 1221, a pipe was laid across the river, which had to be protected from &quot;the oars or poles of the watermen.&quot; The first act of Parliament for improvement of the river, the } (3 Hen. 6. c. 5), was granted in 1425, this also being the first act granted for navigational improvement in England. A second act was passed in 1430, (9 Hen. 6. c. 9), and both authorised local landowners to act as commissioners, who could make improvements to the river including scouring or dredging, and could recoup the cost of the work by levying tolls.
By 1571, the river was an important route for the carriage of grain to London, and the City of London obtained another act, the (13 Eliz. 1. c. 18) to authorise improvements. This included making new cuts, and creating towpaths on both sides of the river. Shoals were removed, and a cut, probably the section which is now called Bow River from Old Ford Locks to Bow Locks, was excavated, which was not subject to any tolls. The plan for a branch from the river to the north of London was not implemented. One innovation was the construction of a pound lock at Waltham Abbey, Essex, in 1577. This had mitred gates at each end, and was probably the second lock to be built in England, although it was the first to be built on a river. It inspired Vallens to write a poem entitled &quot;A tale of Two Swannes&quot; about it in 1590. It was , with wooden sides. The remainder of the control of levels was carried out by &quot;staunches&quot; or &quot;turnpikes&quot;, consisting of a single vertically lifting gate in a weir, through which boats were pulled against the current.

The New River was an attempt to supply clean water from near Ware to the citizens of London, which was completed in 1633. However, the springs at Great Amwell soon proved to be inadequate, and water was drawn from the Lea. The increased extraction of water had a detrimental effect on milling and navigation, and by the early 1700s it had become clear that major work would be needed to produce a solution.

===Smeaton&#x27;s design===

A petition was presented to Parliament resulting in the (12 Geo. 2. c. 32). While recognising the right of the New River Company to extract water, it also enshrined the rights of the millers and bargemen. To resolve a problem where the New River works had blocked the Manifold Ditch, and boats had been forced to use the mill stream to Ware Mill, the mill was bought by the company, and the associated lock became an official right of way. The previous administration by commissioners was replaced by a body of trustees, which it was hoped would be better able to manage the navigation. Although at least two flash locks were built, including one to assist passage past the mill at Broxbourne, there was still friction between the bargemen and the millers, since the use of a flash lock tended to lower the water level above it, to the detriment of the mill. In 1765, the trustees therefore asked John Smeaton to assess the navigation and make recommendations for its improvement.
Smeaton made a survey of the river and produced a report in 1766, in which he recorded that there were 18 staunches at the time, with a lock at Ware and tidal gates at Bow. He recommended that the staunches should be replaced by pound locks, and that several new cuts should be made. These recommendations formed the basis for a parliamentary bill, which was opposed by the owners of the Shoreditch to Enfield turnpike road, the West Ham waterworks and the Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills, who were all concerned that their rights would be affected. However, the trustees were granted an act, the (7 Geo. 3. c. 51), on 29 June and appointed Thomas Yeoman to oversee the work at their first meeting held two days later.

The act authorised the construction of several new stretches of canal, including the Edmonton Cut from Flanders Weir at Chingford to the mill stream at Walthamstow, the Hackney Cut from Lea Bridge to Old Ford, and the Limehouse Cut to bypass the tight bends of Bow Creek near the River Thames. Yeoman was also responsible for setting out towing paths, designing 35 roving bridges, and construction of lock gates. For the Limehouse Cut, Yeoman proposed a cut from Bow tidal gates to Dingley&#x27;s Wharf at Limehouse, which would shorten the distance to London considerably, since it would avoid the long passage around the Isle of Dogs. Mr Dingley, owner of the wharf and a trustee, was awarded part of the contract, and the cut was expected to open on 2 July 1770, but some brickwork failed and had to be repaired. A bridge collapsed in December, but traffic soon developed, and the cut had to be widened to allow barges to pass one another along its entire length. The widening was completed on 1 September 1777.
The trustees decided to finance the work with a loan, and advertisements appeared in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; and other newspapers, indicating that they wished to raise £35,000. The response was huge, with £161,500 being offered, and subscribers were chosen by ballot. Yeoman was overworked, and Edward Rubie was appointed to assist him in February 1769. New cuts and pound locks were opened at Waltham Abbey, Edmonton and Hackney in 1769. In total, of new cuts were constructed, with 12 new locks. Some on the locks, such as Homerton Lock and Pickett&#x27;s Lock, were built on new sections, while others, such as Stanstead Lock, replaced an existing flash-lock. The works were completed to a tight schedule, and with most of it finished, Yeoman resigned in July 1771, although the reasons for his resignation were not recorded.

===Development===


There were further improvements throughout the 19th century, including the &#x27; (13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. cix) to authorise new lock cuts at Hoddesdon, Carthagena Lock (Broxbourne), Waltham Marsh, Tottenham, Walthamstow, Hackney, Leyton and Bromley-by-Bow and new locks at Hunter&#x27;s Gate (Bow Bridge) and Old Ford. The &#x27; (18 &amp; 19 Vict. c. cxcvi) authorised a new lock at Amwell Marsh and the removal of Stanstead Lock. Edmonton Lock was to be removed and Pickett&#x27;s Lock rebuilt. In 1868 the (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. cliv) formed the Lee Conservancy Board to take over control of the river from the former trustees. They established the Lee Conservancy Police, who policed the Lee until merged with the British Transport Police in 1948.

The Lee Navigation bought the Stort Navigation in 1911, and instituted further improvements, including reconstruction of the locks between Enfield and Hertford, the width being increased from : by the 1930s, 130-ton barges could reach Enfield, and 100-ton barges to Ware and Hertford.

The navigation was nationalised in 1948, and control passed to the British Transport Commission. Where possible the locks from Bow Locks through to Ponder&#x27;s End Lock were duplicated and mechanised - the only exception being Pickett&#x27;s Lock. In 1962, the British Transport Commission was wound up, and control passed to the British Waterways Board. Commercial traffic effectively ended in the 1980s.

During the 1950s horse-drawn lighters were still journeying as far as Hertford. By 1980 commercial traffic extended no higher than the Enfield Rolling Mills at Brimsdown, with just one tug, the &quot;Vassal&quot;, regularly at work on the river. Powered by a 120 hp Gardner diesel engine, she would typically tow a train of two lighters loaded with timber from Bow to Hahn&#x27;s Wharf at Edmonton. There are efforts currently underway to revive commercial traffic on the canal with a plan to transport rubbish for incineration at the Edmonton Incinerator.

===Governance===


With the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. 44), the Lee Conservancy area was treated as a special case, with details laid out in section 80 of that act. The Lee Conservancy Catchment Board was created, which inherited some of the powers conferred by the Lee Conservancy Acts, dating from 1870 to 1921, and gave it additional powers in common with other catchment boards, the most important of which was that they could levy rates on county councils and county borough councils throughout their catchment area, to fund drainage works. The members of the catchment board consisted of all the members of the Lee Conservancy Board, together with six additional members. The board were given additional powers, enabling them to hold land without a licence in mortmain, as a result of the (26 Geo. 5 &amp; 1 Edw. 8. c. lxviii). Further change occurred on 1 January 1948, as a result of the Transport Act 1947 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 6. c. 49). Some of the functions of the conservancy board were taken over by the British Transport Commission, when most of the operational canals and waterways were nationalised, and the board was then disbanded. However, where the board had responsibilities for water supply, fisheries, the control of pollution and land drainage, these functions were transferred to the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board. This was authorised by the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board (Additional Functions) Regulations 1947 (SR&amp;O 1947/2797).

The River Boards Act 1948 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6. c. 32) saw the formation of river boards to replace catchment boards throughout England and Wales, but the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board, together with the Thames Conservancy Catchment Board, were excluded from this. River boards were replaced by river authorities as a result of the Water Resources Act 1963 (c. 38), but again the Lee Conservancy was treated as a special case. It made provision that the responsibilities for water conservation outlined in that act could be given to the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board by the joint decision of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Minister of Transport. Those provisions, somewhat modified for the special circumstances of the catchment area, were conferred by the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board (New Functions of River Authorities) Order 1965 (SI 1965/701).

The transport functions of the waterway were transferred to the British Waterways Board, subsequently known as British Waterways, from 1 January 1963, as part of the breakup of the British Transport Commission authorised by the Transport Act 1962. These functions are now managed by the Canal and River Trust, a charitable organisation that took over the role of British Waterways from 2 July 2012. There have been three further changes in the environmental management of the waterway. The Water Act 1973 (c. 37) abolished river authorities, and created ten regional water authorities. The Lee Conservancy was no longer a special case, and became part of the Thames Water Authority. This structure lasted until the passing of the Water Act 1989 (c. 15), which split the water authorities apart, privatising the water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal functions, and transferring the environmental management of river systems including the Lee to the National Rivers Authority. The final change was a result of the Environment Act 1995 (c. 25), which abolished the National Rivers Authority and replaced it by the Environment Agency.

==Recreation==
Much of the Lee Navigation is within Lee Valley Park, a multi-county regional park and open space preserve. Local jurisdictions also maintain parks on the canals in Lee Valley Park.

The Lea Valley Walk, a long-distance public walking path and bicycle trail from the headwaters to the Thames confluence, follows the canal towpaths in the Lee Navigation section.

<doc id="445654" wikidata="Q173093" url="?curid=445654" title="Vanwall">
<text>Vanwall was a British motor racing team and racing car constructor that was active in Formula One during the 1950s. Founded by Tony Vandervell, the Vanwall name was derived by combining the name of the team owner with that of his Thinwall bearings produced at the Vandervell Products factory at Acton, London. Originally entering modified Ferraris in non-championship races, Vanwall constructed their first cars to race in the 1954 Formula One season. The team achieved their first race win in the 1957 British Grand Prix, with Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks sharing a VW 5, earning the team the distinction of constructing the first British-built car to win a World Championship race. Vanwall won the inaugural Constructors&#x27; Championship in Formula One in , in the process allowing Moss and Brooks to finish second and third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship standings, each winning three races for Vanwall. Vandervell&#x27;s failing health meant 1958 would be the last full season; the squad ran cars in a handful of races in the following years, but finished racing in 1961.

==History==
Tony Vandervell&#x27;s Vanwall Company made Babbit bearings (UK White Metal bearings) under licence from the Cleveland Graphite Bronze Company; W. A. Robotham of Rolls-Royce said that &quot;it was an exceedingly difficult task ... knowing the American company well&quot;. 

Tony Vandervell was one of the original backers of British Racing Motors. In the early 1950s he entered a series of modified Ferraris in Formule Libre races under the name &quot;Thinwall Special&quot;.

The first actual Vanwalls were known as Vanwall Specials and were built for the new Formula 1 regulations in 1954 at Cox Green, Maidenhead. The chassis was designed by Owen Maddock and built by the Cooper Car Company.
The 2.0 L engine was designed by Norton engineer Leo Kuzmicki, and was essentially four Manx single-cylinder () engines with a common waterjacket, cylinder head (a copy of the Norton&#x27;s) and valvetrain, with induction by four AMAL motorcycle carburetors. This combination was fitted to a Rolls-Royce B40 military engine crankcase, copied in aluminium. Designed for Formula Two, which was supplanted before it appeared, the car debuted in a Grande Epreuve in the 1954 British Grand Prix. Against 2½ litre Formula One competition, it was at a decided disadvantage. The Goodyear disc brakes (built by Vanwall) proved successful, but the front suspension and fuel and cooling systems were troublesome. Development continued with a switch to Bosch fuel injection (thanks to Vandervell&#x27;s &quot;persuading&quot; Daimler-Benz, a major Bosch customer, to allow it), while retaining the AMAL throttle bodies; they were plagued with throttle linkage trouble, due to vibration from the big four-cylinder. Vanwall also increased the capacity of the engines, first to () for Peter Collins at Monaco 1955, and then a full (). Vanwalls then ran for a season in F1 without much in the way of success. At the end of the 1955 season, it was plain that the engine was sound, but that the Ferrari-derived chassis needed improvement. It was suggested to Vandervell that he should hire the services of a young up-and-coming designer to improve their cars. The designer was Colin Chapman.

The new 1956 cars designed by Chapman (along with the aerodynamicist Frank Costin) were of space frame construction, the De Dion rear axle&#x27;s unsprung weight reduced and front torsion bar added. (None of these ideas were revolutionary, but Chapman was happy simply to be meticulous.) Furthermore, a fifth gear and Porsche synchromesh were added to the transmission. The driving seat was placed above this and could not be reduced below above the road, making the height very problematic (the top of the driver&#x27;s helmet was fully from the road surface, while the vertically mounted engine made a reduction impractical in any case), and the handling was suspect despite Chapman&#x27;s best efforts. The solution which today is obvious, mounting the engine behind the driver, would take two more years to be accepted. Costin made the most of it, and produced a car &quot;much faster in a straight line than any of its rivals&quot;.

The new car showed early promise in 1956 by winning the non-championship F1 race at Silverstone against strong opposition. It set the lap record at Syracuse Stirling Moss drove the car to victory in what was his only drive for Vanwall that year, as he was still contracted to drive for Maserati in F1. Talented drivers Harry Schell and Maurice Trintignant were the full-timers for the season. However, neither of them had much success although the car showed obvious potential.

With the car developing and becoming ever more competitive, Moss eventually decided to drive for the team in 1957. He was joined by two Englishmen, Tony Brooks and Stuart Lewis-Evans. As the 1957 season unfolded, the cars became faster and more reliable. Moss and Brooks duly shared Vanwall&#x27;s first Grand Prix victory in Britain at Aintree, and Moss went on to win both the Italian (where only being piloted by Fangio enabled the Maserati to run with the Vanwalls, for Moss finished with 41 seconds in hand even after a pit stop) and Pescara Grands Prix.

At the end of 1957, alcohol fuels were banned and replaced by a compulsory 130-octane aviation gasoline. This caused problems for Vanwall and BRM with their large bore engines that required methanol for engine cooling. As a result, the Vanwall&#x27;s power dropped from at 7,500 rpm (308 bhp with nitromethane) to on the test bed. During the race, where revs were reduced, only 255–262 bhp at 7,200–7,400 rpm was available. This put them at a disadvantage to the new Dino Ferrari V6 cars with a claimed 290 PS (286 bhp) at 8,300 rpm. The Vanwall&#x27;s superior road holding (thanks to suspension changes, new steel wheels, and new nylon-cord Dunlop R5 racing tyres), streamlining, 5-speed gearbox, and disc brakes helped to offset this.

All three drivers stayed with the team in 1958, and Moss (wins in the Netherlands, Portugal and Morocco) and Brooks (wins in Belgium, Germany and Italy) each won three championship races that season. Vanwall became the first team to win the Constructors&#x27; Championship, held for the first time that season. However, Moss lost out to Mike Hawthorn in the Drivers&#x27; Championship by a single point to finish second, with Brooks ending the season in third. Their triumph at the end of the season was sadly marred when, during the final race of the year in Morocco, Lewis-Evans was fatally injured in an accident.

The 1958 season was the last one in which Vanwall entered every race. Vandervell&#x27;s health was failing and he had been advised by his doctors to rest. The team continued half-heartedly. Brooks made one appearance in a lower and lighter Vanwall at 1959 British Grand Prix, proving less successful against the new mid-engined Coopers, and the team tried again with another car in the 1960 French Grand Prix. These efforts lacked the seriousness of the past however and they were unsuccessful.

The last racing Vanwall was an &quot;unwieldy&quot; rear-engined machine produced for the 1961 3.0 litre Intercontinental Formula. Although showing promise when campaigned by John Surtees in two races, development was stopped short when the formula did not find success in Europe. The engine was enlarged to (), rated at on 100 octane petrol.

The Donington Collection had a complete example of each model, including the rear-engined car.

In 2003 Vanwall Cars was formed by Arthur Wolstenholme, producing the Vanwall GPR V12, a single-seater road-legal car bearing a strong resemblance to early Vanwall racing cars, and the Sports Racer, a two-seater of a similar style. In 2012 the trademark was acquired from Mahle Engine Systems UK by Sanderson International Marketing Ltd.
In Summer 2016 Vanwall completed and sold an official replica 1957 Vanwall and then in October 2020 Vanwall 1958 Ltd, majority owned by Iain Sanderson, announced the commissioning of Hall &amp; Hall to build 6 original 1958 specification &#x27;continuation cars&#x27;.

<text>Ken Doherty (born 17 September 1969) is an Irish professional snooker player from Ranelagh in Dublin. He is the sport&#x27;s only world champion from Ireland, having won the title in 1997, and one of only four players from outside the United Kingdom to have won the title in the modern era. He is the only player to have won the world amateur and world professional title, having also been world U-21 champion.

After moving from Dublin to London to pursue his snooker career, Doherty won the World Under-21 Amateur Championship and the World Amateur Championship in 1989. He turned professional the following year and reached the first of his 17 ranking finals at the 1992 Grand Prix, losing 9–10 to Jimmy White. He won the first of his six ranking titles several months later at the 1993 Welsh Open, beating Alan McManus 9–7 in the final, which helped him enter the top 16 for the first time in the 1993–94 world rankings. At the 1997 World Snooker Championship, he ended Stephen Hendry&#x27;s record 29-match winning streak at the Crucible with an 18–12 victory in the final.

Doherty has been runner-up at two other World Championships. As defending champion at the 1998 event, he had an opportunity to break the Crucible curse but lost the final 12–18 to John Higgins. Facing Mark Williams in the 2003 final, Doherty recovered from 2–10 behind to tie the scores at 11–11 but lost 16–18. In other Triple Crown events, he has been UK Championship runner-up three times (losing 5–10 to Hendry in 1994, 1–10 to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in 2001 and 9–10 to Williams in 2002), and Masters runner-up twice (losing 8–10 to Higgins in 1999 and by the same score to Matthew Stevens in 2000). 

Doherty won his most recent ranking title at the 2006 Malta Cup, where he defeated Higgins 9–8 in the final. He achieved his career highest ranking of second in the 2006/2007 rankings. After 15 consecutive seasons within the top 16, he fell to 18th place in the 2008/2009 rankings and 44th place in the 2009/2010 rankings, after which he has never regained his top-16 standing. Since the end of the 2016–17 season, he has finished outside the top 64 in the world rankings multiple times; he has remained on the professional tour though invitational tour cards, the most recent of which was issued in June 2024 for the 2024–25 and 2025–26 seasons. Doherty also competes on the World Seniors Tour, where he won the 2018 UK Seniors Championship and has twice been runner-up at the World Seniors Championship, in 2020 and 2024. Since 2012, he has been a director of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association; he also served from 2021 to 2024 as inaugural chair of the WPBSA Players organisation.

Doherty combines his playing career with commentary and punditry work on televised snooker broadcasts. 

== Early life ==
Born on 17 September 1969, Doherty grew up in a working-class Catholic family in Ranelagh, Dublin, with his three siblings, two older brothers and a younger sister. He first became interested in snooker when he started to watch the BBC programme &quot;Pot Black&quot; with his father at eight years old. At the time, Doherty particularly admired Alex Higgins. He received a miniature snooker table as a Christmas present, and soon afterwards began playing on full-sized tables at Jason&#x27;s Snooker Hall in Ranelagh. When he was 13 years old, his father died from a heart attack. Shortly afterwards, he won the Irish Under-16 Championship. After leaving school, he moved to London to pursue his snooker career, receiving free accommodation and practice time at Ilford Snooker Centre courtesy of Irish professional Eugene Hughes. He won the World Under-21 Amateur Championship and the World Amateur Championship in 1989, and turned professional the following year.

==Career==
Doherty appeared in two quarter-finals in his first season as a professional, at the 1991 Classic and the 1991 Irish Masters, being beaten 5–3 by Jimmy White on both occasions. In the following snooker year, he won the qualifying event for the 1992 Masters, though there he lost 1–5 to John Parrott in the first round. He also made it to the semi-finals of the 1992 British and Strachan Open, and reached the final of the 1992 Irish Masters. He was a finalist at the 1992 Grand Prix as well, narrowly losing 10–9 to Jimmy White. In the same event a year later, Doherty lost in the final again, this time 6–9 to Peter Ebdon.

Doherty&#x27;s first ranking title was the 1993 Welsh Open, enough to take him into the top 16 in the world, where he remained until the 2007–08 season. He also won the 1993 Irish Professional Championship, was a semi-finalist at the 1993 International Open, and a quarter-finalist again at the 1993 Irish Masters. More quarter-final appearances followed at the 1994 Masters and the 1994 World Championship, his only run past the second round in the latter before 1997, and later on in the 1994 Dubai Classic, repeating his result from the previous edition of the event, down to the scoreline as he was beaten 5–4 both times. These weren&#x27;t his only replicated outcomes, he also won the 1994 Pontins Professional just like he did last year, as well as the 1994 Scottish Masters after winning it in 1993 too. In November he made it to the final of the 1994 UK Championship, which he lost 5–10 to Stephen Hendry, then in December he reached the quarter-final stage of the 1994 European Open, where he was defeated 5–3 by Nigel Bond. In the second half of the season, he was in yet another quarter-final at the 1995 Irish Masters, and in two finals, at the 1995 Pontins Professional and the 1995 European League.

Doherty became only the third player from outside the United Kingdom (after Australian Horace Lindrum in 1952 and Canadian Cliff Thorburn in 1980) to win the World Championship when he beat Stephen Hendry 18–12 in the 1997 final, at the age of 27. He also reached the World Championship final in 1998, losing to John Higgins, and in 2003, losing narrowly to Mark Williams. The latter run was noted for some outstanding comebacks, including final-frame wins over Graeme Dott and Shaun Murphy, a 13–8 win over Higgins in a match where Doherty raced ahead 10–0 but Higgins fought back to 10–7, and a semi-final fightback from 9–15 to beat Paul Hunter 17–16. In that championship, Doherty played more frames than anyone before or since. In the final, Williams led 11–4, but Doherty fought back to 12–12 and 16–16. In frame 33, Doherty missed the penultimate red with a clearance easily available. Williams won that crucial frame and the next to prevail 18–16.

Doherty narrowly failed to achieve a maximum break when he missed a routine final black off its spot in the 15th frame of the 2000 Benson &amp; Hedges Masters final against Matthew Stevens, a match Doherty eventually lost 10–8. This one pot would have seen him win an £80,000 sports car. However, his 140 break at least brought him the consolation of the £19,000 highest break prize. He did make a 147 break two years later though, when he won the Cue Club Pro-Am tournament in Killarney in 2002. He made light of his prize on television shortly afterwards, which was allegedly €300, a BMX bicycle and a toy Ferrari car. His first official maximum was compiled in 2012, during a first round win against Julian Treiber at the Paul Hunter Classic.

In 2001 Doherty became one of the few players who have won back-to-back ranking events, as he won the Welsh Open and the Thailand Masters, while also reaching the final of the next tournament, the Regal Scottish Open.

In the 2005 World Championship, Doherty beat Barry Pinches in the first round 10–5, winning the last 8 frames, but was knocked out in the second round by Alan McManus 13–11.

Following an average start to the 2005–06 season, Doherty won the Malta Cup in February 2006, beating John Higgins in the final. Doherty had trailed 8–5 at one stage but managed a stirring comeback, winning four frames in a row. He called the victory, which bridged a five-year gap, his &quot;most important tournament win since the World Championship&quot;.

Doherty started brightly in the 2006 World Championship, winning his first match by defeating Barry Hawkins 10–1, then he beat Matthew Stevens 13–8, playing superbly to win the last five frames. He was the favourite in his quarter-final match against Marco Fu but lost 13–10. It was 8–8 as the final session started, but Doherty struggled despite winning a frame in which he required three snookers. Although he led 7–6, 8–7, 9–8 and 10–9, he could never quite take decisive advantage to win the match. Doherty admitted afterwards that he &quot;blew it&quot; but that he still had &quot;a couple more years&quot; to come back and win the title. He ended the 2005–06 season as the world number 2, his highest ranking ever.

He made a solid start to the 2006–07 season by reaching the quarter-final at what is the closest thing to a home tournament for him, the Northern Ireland Trophy at Belfast&#x27;s Waterfront Hall. He followed this up with a last-16 defeat at the Grand Prix in Aberdeen and the UK Championship in York. He reached the quarter-finals of the next two tournaments, the Masters and the Malta Cup. He lost in the first round of the World Championship and, although clearly disappointed, the Dubliner vowed to continue. He was provisional world number 1 for most of 2006–07, but finished the season as 4th in the rankings.

In October 2006, he won the invitational Irish Professional Championship for a second time, having previously captured the title in 1993. He beat Michael Judge 9–4 in the final. A year later he defended his title with a resounding 9–2 victory over Fergal O&#x27;Brien. He followed this up a week later by becoming the first Irishman to win the Pot Black Invitational tournament, beating Shaun Murphy 76–31 in the one-frame final.

Doherty did not start the 2007–08 season well, winning only one match during the first four ranking tournaments. However, he did reach the semi-finals of the Masters with victories over Mark Williams and Shaun Murphy, before losing to eventual champion Mark Selby. He then reached the final of the Malta Cup for a record fifth time, defeating John Higgins in the semi-finals, before losing to Murphy in the final. Unfortunately for Doherty, neither of these events are ranking events, meaning his performances did nothing to keep him in the top rankings for the 2008–09 season. Defeat to Liang Wenbo in the first round of the World Championship ensured that he dropped out of the top 16 after 15 years, and he started the new season 32nd on the provisional one-year list. A run of qualifying defeats saw him drop as low as 38th before the UK Championship.

Doherty&#x27;s poor run of form continued during the 2008–09 season during which he won only two matches. For the first time since 1993, he failed to qualify for the World Championship, having been beaten in the final qualifying round by Gerard Greene.

Doherty&#x27;s form saw an upturn in the 2009–10 season, with a rise back into the top 32 in the rankings, up from 44th to 30th; this was due to a quarter-final appearance in the 2009 Shanghai Masters, and a last-16 appearance in the 2009 Grand Prix. Doherty defeated six-time World Championship finalist Jimmy White 10–3, and two-time Crucible semi-finalist Joe Swail 10–1 to mark his return to the World Championship for the first time since 2008. In an amusing moment, Doherty got down on his knees and kissed the carpet upon his return to the venue. However, he lost his first-round match 10–4 to reigning Masters champion Mark Selby.

The 2010–11 season proved to be a mixed campaign for Doherty, who made it to the last 32 of the 2010 World Open, yet missed out on qualifying for the 2011 German Masters, the 2011 Welsh Open and crucially, blowing a 6–3 lead, losing 10–6 to Jimmy Robertson in the final stage of qualifying for the 2011 World Championship, meaning he had only reached the Crucible once out of his previous three attempts.

Doherty had an excellent start to the 2011–12 season as he qualified for the Australian Goldfields Open, where he reached his first ranking event semi-final since 2006. He beat Mark Selby 5–3 in the quarter-finals, sealing the match with a clearance which he described as the best of his career. Doherty also stated that he almost quit the game in 2009, following his downturn in form which saw him drop to world number 55. He failed to replicate his form in the semi-finals, however, as he was beaten 2–6 by Mark Williams. In the remainder of the season Doherty qualified for the German Masters and the Welsh Open, but was defeated in the first round by Williams and Mark Allen respectively, without picking up a frame. He also reached the final of the non-ranking Irish Classic, losing 2–5 to Fergal O&#x27;Brien.

He was ranked 32nd in the world going into the 2012 World Championship qualifiers, where he faced Anthony Hamilton. The match went into a deciding frame with Doherty 40 points behind, but he profited from a Hamilton error to produce a match-winning clearance to win 10–9, and earned a first-round match against Neil Robertson. He lost 4–10, and finished the season ranked world number 35.

Doherty began the 2012–13 season by losing 4–5 to Stuart Bingham in the second round of the Wuxi Classic, and 3–5 to Martin Gould in the first round of the Australian Goldfields Open.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to reach the quarter-finals of the event, losing 0–4 to Mark Selby. Doherty was defeated in qualifying for the Shanghai Masters and the 2012 UK Championship, and failed to advance beyond the wildcard round of the International Championship. At the fifth European Tour Event, the Scottish Open, he saw off the likes of Luca Brecel and Ryan Day to reach the semi-finals where he lost 2–4 to Ding Junhui. Doherty was eliminated in the first round of the German Masters by Peter Lines, but then had his best run of the season at the Welsh Open. He beat four-time world champion John Higgins 4–1 and Tom Ford 4–3 to make it through to the quarter-finals. He led Stuart Bingham 2–0, but a series of missed pots saw Doherty lose his confidence and he went on to lose 3–5. His aforementioned run to the semi-finals of the Scottish Open helped him finish 16th on the PTC Order of Merit to qualify as one of the top 26 players for the Finals, but he lost 2–4 to Kurt Maflin in the first round. Doherty almost pulled off one of his trademark comebacks against Matthew Selt in the final round of the World Championship qualifying, as from 4–9 down he levelled at 9–9, but he lost the deciding frame. The result meant that this was the first season where Doherty had not featured in any of snooker&#x27;s Triple Crown events. Doherty increased his ranking by eight spots during the season to finish it ranked world number 27.

Doherty qualified for all but two of the ranking events in the 2013–14 season, but couldn&#x27;t advance beyond the second round in any of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In April, he qualified for the World Championship after a 10–5 win against Dechawat Poomjaeng in the final qualifying round. Doherty was the oldest player in the draw in his 19th Crucible appearance, and after trailing Stuart Bingham 5–4 in the opening session of their first round match, Doherty produced his best snooker to take all six frames in the next session and win a match at the Crucible for the first time since 2006. He then lost 13–8 to Alan McManus, the second oldest player in the event.

Doherty won three qualifying matches and a wildcard round to be at the 2014 Shanghai Masters, where he met Mark Selby in the first round, losing 5–2. The only other tournament Doherty could advance to the last 32 in this season was the 2014 UK Championship by overcoming Mitchell Mann and Michael White, but he was beaten 6–1 by Ricky Walden. He was knocked out of the semi-finals of the World Seniors Championship by Fergal O&#x27;Brien.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the final round of World Championship qualifying following wins over Reanne Evans and Lee Walker, but was thrashed 10–3 by Mark Davis. Doherty was placed 45th in the world rankings at the end of the season, the lowest he had been since 1991.

A 6–0 thrashing at the hands of Peter Ebdon ended Doherty&#x27;s International Championship run at the first round stage, and he lost 6–3 to Mark Davis in the second round of the 2015 UK Championship, having whitewashed Tony Drago 6–0 in the opener. His best results in the season were a pair of last 32 exits at the German Masters and Welsh Open, losing 5–1 to Stephen Maguire and 4–2 to Joe Perry respectively. His end of season ranking of 57 was the lowest of his 26-year professional career. He had two last 16 showings during 2016–17, and would have dropped off the tour at the end of the season as he was outside of the top 64 in the world rankings. However, the day before the 2017 World Championship started, it was announced that Doherty would receive an invitational tour card for the next two years.

Doherty played against Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, the defending champion, in the second round of the 2018 UK Championship. Doherty was sharp throughout the first half of the first session, leading 3–1, then he extended his lead further to 4–1, but O&#x27;Sullivan fought back to win the next 4 frames. Doherty was able to force a decider, but ultimately just one error from him was enough for his opponent to finish the frame, to prevent Doherty from causing a considerable upset in the tournament where many seeds fell to lower-ranked players already, and more would follow. Doherty would be the only player that came close to defeating the eventual champion, as the other matches, with the exception of the final, produced very one-sided results.

Doherty&#x27;s loss in the 2020 World Championship qualifying meant that he finished the season outside the top 64 and fell out of the tour. However, he was given an invitational tour card to continue playing professional snooker in the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons. The same occurred at his loss in the 2022 World Championship qualifying, for the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons, and at the end of the 2023–24 season, when Doherty had dropped to 79 in the world rankings, but was able to remain on the World Snooker Tour after being given a further two-year invitational card by the governing body.

==Playing style==
Despite being most renowned as an intelligent tactician, he is a heavy scorer as well when amongst the balls at close quarters. This relatively cautious approach has led to the nickname &quot;Crafty Ken&quot;.

Doherty has played his entire career with a warped cue randomly selected from the cue rack in Jason&#x27;s, a club where he practised. He humorously revealed that the club manager originally wanted £5 for it, but Doherty haggled him down to £2. In his words, &quot;It&#x27;s warped. I must be one of the few professionals playing with a warped cue, but I wouldn&#x27;t dream of changing it. I have got used to holding it in a certain way, with my eye trained on a piece of grain.

==Media work==
Doherty works on TV coverage of snooker matches with the BBC snooker coverage team. He became a regular commentator for the BBC starting with the 2009 Masters, following the side-lining of veteran expert Clive Everton. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he began working on ITV&#x27;s snooker coverage.

Doherty guested as a presenter on the Morning Show on East Coast FM. He presents a sports programme on Sunshine 106.8FM on Saturday mornings.

==Personal life==
Doherty married his wife Sarah, who is originally from India, in December 2001. The couple resided in Rathgar, Dublin, and have a son, Christian, born in 2007. In 2022, Doherty revealed that he and his wife had separated amicably. He now lives in England.

Doherty was nearly blinded in 2002 in a bathroom accident; after slipping, he struck an ornament, which narrowly missed his left eye. However, the distinctive scar on his right cheek dates back to his seventh birthday, when he fell off a shed roof onto a metal dustbin.

Doherty and his family are of Roman Catholic faith, with his mother, Rose usually praying while Ken was playing matches.

In May 2007, Doherty appeared on RTÉ&#x27;s spoof show &quot;Anonymous&quot;, heavily disguised as a priest. Ostensibly he was a beginner at snooker and received some tips from Alex Higgins, who was initially fooled by the make-up and Doherty&#x27;s hopeless play. However, as &quot;Fr Donoghue&quot; began to clear the table, Higgins&#x27; suspicions were aroused and Doherty was eventually rumbled. Doherty&#x27;s disguise was enough to fool his mother and his wife. In 2020, Doherty made a cameo appearance along with Jack Lisowski and Liang Wenbo in the snooker movie &quot;Break&quot;.

Doherty has been a WPBSA player director since 2012.

<text>Velupillai Prabhakaran (; ; ; 26 November 1954 – 18 May 2009) was a Tamil guerrilla in Sri Lanka. Prabhakaran was a major figure of Tamil nationalism, and the founder and leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The LTTE was a militant organization that sought to create an independent Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka in reaction to the oppression of the country&#x27;s Tamil population by the Sri Lankan government. Under his direction, the LTTE undertook a military campaign against the Sri Lankan government for more than 25 years.

Prabhakaran was the youngest of four children, born in Valvettithurai, on Sri Lanka&#x27;s Jaffna peninsula&#x27;s northern coast. Considered the heart of Tamil culture and literature in Sri Lanka, Jaffna was concentrated with growing Tamil nationalism, which called for autonomy for Tamils to protest the discrimination against them by the Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lankan state and Sinhalese civilians since the country&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in 1948.

Founded in 1976, after the 1974 Tamil conference killings by Sri Lankan government police, the LTTE came to prominence in 1983 after it ambushed a patrol of the Sri Lanka Army outside Jaffna, resulting in the deaths of 13 soldiers. This ambush, along with the subsequent pogrom that resulted in the deaths of thousands of Tamil civilians, is generally considered the start of the Sri Lankan Civil War. After years of fighting, including the intervention of the Indian Army (IPKF), the conflict was halted after international mediation in 2001. By then, the LTTE, which came to be known as the Tamil Tigers, controlled large swathes of land in the north and east of the country, running a &quot;de facto&quot; state with Prabhakaran as its leader. Peace talks eventually broke down, and the Sri Lanka Army launched a military campaign to defeat the LTTE in 2006.

Prabhakaran, who had said, &quot;I would prefer to die in honour rather than being caught alive by the enemy&quot;, was killed in a firefight with the Sri Lankan Army in May 2009. Charles Anthony, his eldest son, was also killed. Additionally, the bodies of his wife and daughter were reportedly found by the Sri Lankan army; the Sri Lankan government later denied the report. His 12-year-old second son was executed a short time later. Prabhakaran&#x27;s reported death and the subsequent ceasefire announcement by Selvarasa Pathmanathan, the Tigers&#x27; chief of international relations, brought an end to the armed conflict.

A significant figure of Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism, Prabhakaran is often seen as a martyr by Sri Lankan Tamils. However, he is acknowledged to have created one of the most ruthless and sophisticated insurgencies of the modern era, with many of the tactics he pioneered influencing political militant groups globally. Prabhakaran himself argued that he chose military means only after observing that nonviolent means were ineffectual and obsolete, especially after the Tamil Eelam revolutionary Thileepan&#x27;s fatal hunger strike in 1987 had no effect. Influenced by Indian nationalists Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh, both of whom participated the revolutionary movement for Indian independence, Prabhakaran declared that his goal was &#x27;revolutionary socialism and the creation of an egalitarian society&#x27;.

==Early life==
Velupillai Prabhakaran was born in the northern coastal town of Valvettithurai on 26 November 1954, the youngest of four children. His parents, Thiruvenkadam Velupillai and Vallipuram Parvathy, belonged to the Karaiyar community. Thiruvenkadam Velupillai was the District Land Officer in the Ceylon Government. He came from an influential and wealthy family who owned and managed the major Hindu temples in Valvettithurai.

Angered by the discrimination and violent persecution against Tamil people by successive Sri Lankan governments, Prabhakaran joined the student group &quot;Tamil Youth Front&quot; (TYF) during the standardisation debates. In 1972, he founded the Tamil New Tigers (TNT), a successor to many earlier organizations that protested against the post-colonial political direction of the country, in which the minority Sri Lankan Tamils were pitted against the majority Sinhalese people.

In 1975, after becoming heavily involved in the Tamil movement, he carried out the first major political assassination by a Tamil group, shooting Alfred Duraiappah, the mayor of Jaffna, at point-blank range in front of the Hindu temple at Ponnaalai. The assassination was in response to the killings of Tamils in the 1974 Tamil conference incident, for which Duraiappah was blamed due to having backed the then-ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party.

==Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam==

===Founding of the LTTE===
In the early 1970s, United Front government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike introduced the policy of standardisation which made the criteria for university admission lower for the Sinhalese than for the Tamils. Several organizations to counter this act were formed by Tamil students. Prabhakaran, aged 15, dropped out of school and became associated with the &quot;Kuttimani-Thangathurai&quot; group (which evolved later into TELO) formed by Selvarajah Yogachandran (known as Kuttimani) and Nadarajah Thangathurai who both also hailed from Valvettithurai.

Prabhakaran along with Kuttimani, Ponnuthurai Sivakumaran and other prominent rebels joined the &quot;Tamil Manavar Peravai&quot; formed by a student named &quot;Satiyaseelan&quot; in 1970. This group comprised Tamil youth who advocated the rights of students to have fair enrollment. In 1973, Prabhakaran teamed up with &quot;Chetti Thanabalasingam&quot; and with a fraction of the Tamil Manavar Peravai to form the Tamil New Tigers (TNT). Their first notable attack was held at the Duraiappa stadium in Jaffna placing a bomb in an attempt to murder the Jaffna Mayor Alfred Duraiappah. A member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party who was loyal to Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Duraiappah was seen as a traitor by the Tamil masses. Failing the attempt, Prabhakaran managed to shoot and kill Duraiappah who was on a visit at a Hindu temple at Ponnalai on 27 July 1975.

On 5 May 1976, the TNT was renamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), commonly known as the &quot;Tamil Tigers&quot;.

=== Eelam War I ===
The LTTE by the 1980s operated in more attacks against police and military forces. On 23 July 1983, the LTTE ambushed an army patrol and killed 13 Sri Lankan soldiers in Thirunelveli, Sri Lanka. As a response to this were one of the worst government sponsored anti-Tamil riots held (the event known as &quot;Black July&quot;) resulting in the destruction of Tamil houses and shops and deaths of hundreds of Tamils and making over 150,000 Tamils homeless. As a result of the riots several Tamils joining the LTTE and the LTTE marked the beginning of the Eelam War I. With Prabhakaran being the most wanted man in Sri Lanka, he had said in 1984, &quot;I would prefer to die in honour rather than being caught alive by the enemy.&quot; Prabhakaran held his first speech on 4 August 1987 at the Suthumalai Amman temple in front of over 100,000 people explaining the position of the LTTE. This speech is seen as a historic turning point in the Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism. In the same year, &quot;Asiaweek&quot; compared Prabhakaran to revolutionary Che Guevara, while &quot;Newsweek&quot; called him &quot;the stuff of legend&quot;.

=== Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi ===
The LTTE were allegedly involved in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the ex-prime minister of India in 1991, which they denied involvement and alleged the event as an international conspiracy against them. However, in a 2011 interview, Kumaran Pathmanathan, who was the Treasurer of LTTE and its chief arms procurer, apologized to India for Velupillai Prabhakaran&#x27;s &quot;mistake&quot; of killing former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He further said Rajiv&#x27;s assassination was &quot;well planned and done actually with Prabhakaran and (LTTE intelligence chief Pottu Amman). Everyone knows the truth&quot;. The TADA Court issued an arrest warrant for plotting of the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. In October 2010 the charges against Prabhakaran were dropped by the TADA Court after the Central Bureau of Investigation filed a report stating that he was dead and the case was closed.

=== Peace talks ===
Prabhakaran&#x27;s first and only major press conference was held in Killinochchi on 10 April 2002. It was reported that more than 200 journalists from the local and foreign media attended this event and they had to go through a 10-hour security screening before the event in which Anton Balasingham introduced the LTTE leader as the &quot;President and Prime&quot; &quot;Minister of Tamil Eelam.&quot; A number of questions were asked about LTTE&#x27;s commitment towards the erstwhile peace process and Prabhakaran and Dr. Anton Balasingham jointly answered the questions. Repeated questions about his involvement in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination were only answered in a sober note by both Balasingham and Prabhakaran. They called it a &quot;tragic incident&quot; (&quot;Thunbiyal Chambavam&quot;, as quoted in Tamil) they requested the press &quot;not to dig into an incident that happened 10 years ago.&quot;

During the interview, he stated that the right condition has not risen to give up the demand of Tamil Eelam. He further mentioned that &quot;There are three fundamentals. That is Tamil homeland, Tamil nationality and Tamil right to self-determination. These are the fundamental demands of the Tamil people. Once these demands are accepted or a political solution is put forward by recognising these three fundamentals and our people are satisfied with the solutions we will consider giving up the demand for Eelam.&quot; He further added that Tamil Eelam was not only the demand of the LTTE but also the demand of the Tamil people.

Prabhakaran also answered a number of questions in which he reaffirmed their commitment towards the peace process, quoted &quot;We are sincerely committed to the peace process. It is because we are sincerely committed to peace that we continued a four month cessation of hostilities&quot;. He was also firm in de-proscription of the LTTE by Sri Lanka and India, &quot;We want the government of India to lift the ban on the LTTE. We will raise the issue at the appropriate time.&quot;

Prabhakaran also insisted firmly that only de-proscription would bring forth an amenable solution to the ongoing peace process mediated by Norway: &quot;We have informed the government, we have told the Norwegians that de-proscription is a necessary condition for the commencements of talks.&quot;

=== Sri Lankan Army Northern offensive and death ===
When the Sri Lankan military rapidly advanced into the last LTTE held territory in the final days of 2008–2009 SLA Northern offensive, Prabhakaran and his top leadership retreated into Vellamullivaikkal, Mullaitivu. Fierce fighting occurred between LTTE and the Sri Lanka Army during these last few days. At around 3:00 a.m. on 18 May 2009, Prabhakaran&#x27;s son Charles Anthony tried to break the defenses of the Army, but was unsuccessful. He died along with around 100 other LTTE fighters. Troops found 12 million rupees in his possession. By noon that day, reports emerged that Prabhakaran was killed by a rocket attack while trying to flee the conflict zone in a captured ambulance and his body was badly burned. But this rumour was proven false in a short while. Skirmishes occurred also in the evening of 18 May around eastern bank of Nandikadal lagoon. A team of LTTE cadres consisting of 30 most loyal bodyguards of Prabhakaran and Prabhakaran himself tried to sneak through the mangrove islands of Nandikadal to its west bank. It has been alleged that one bodyguard had a can of gasoline with him to burn the Tiger leader&#x27;s body if he was killed or committed suicide. This was to prevent the enemy seizing his body. Clearing and mopping-up operations were carried out by troops under Colonel G. V. Ravipriya from 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm that evening, but they did not encounter this last group of LTTE fighters that day. At 7:30 am next morning, mopping-up operations started again. This time, they were confronted by the fighters, led by Prabhakaran himself. Fighting went on until 9:30 am 19 May 2009. The firing stopped as all LTTE fighters died in the battle. Troops started collecting bodies again. This time, Sergeant Muthu Banda, attached to Sri Lanka Army Task Force VIII, reported to Ravipriya that a body similar to Prabhakaran&#x27;s had been found. After the body, which was floating among the mangroves, was brought ashore, Colonel Ravipriya positively identified it as that of the leader of the LTTE. A dog tag marked &quot;001&quot;, two pistols, a T56 rifle with telescopic sight, a satellite phone, and a canister filled with diabetic medicine were found along with the body.

At 12:15 pm army commander Sarath Fonseka officially announced Prabhakaran&#x27;s death on TV. At around 1:00 pm his body was shown in Swarnavahini for the first time. Prabakaran&#x27;s identity was confirmed by Karuna Amman, his former confidant, and through DNA testing against genetic material from his son, who had been killed earlier by the Sri Lankan military. Circumstantial evidence suggested that his death was caused by massive head trauma; several claims on his death have been made and it&#x27;s alleged that his death was due to a shot at close range. There are also allegations that he was executed, a claim vehemently denied by Sri Lankan authorities. Karuna Amman claimed Prabhakaran shot himself but it was denied by Fonseka who claimed the injury was from shrapnel citing the lack of an exit wound. A week later, the new Tamil Tiger leader, Selvarasa Pathmanathan, admitted that Prabhakaran was dead.

==Alleged claims of survival==
Despite the announcement of his death by both the Government and LTTE remnants, certain groups and media have claimed that Prabhakaran survived the war and managed to escape. In 2009 a Tamil website showed an image showing Prabhakaran viewing a news report of his death in TV which was sent to France 24 as proof of his survival. But France 24 noted that the photo appeared to be photoshopped. In 2010 Pro-LTTE website TamilWin claimed that the body of Prabhakaran shown belonged to a Sri Lankan soldier showing images of a Prabhakaran look-alike in the Sri Lankan army. The theory of Prabhakaran&#x27;s survival is also supported by Tamil Nadu politician Vaiko who claims Prabhakaran would emerge from hiding at the right time. The claim of Prabhakaran&#x27;s survival was reiterated in 2023 by Indian activist Pazha Nedumaran, who declared through a press conference held at Thanjavur that the slain leader of LTTE is &quot;still alive and doing well&quot; and that he has been in contact with Prabhakaran&#x27;s family. The claim was rejected by Sri Lanka which issued a statement stating that Prabhakaran&#x27;s corpse had been confirmed by his close associates as well as DNA testing.

==Philosophy and ideology==
Prabhakaran was influenced by prominent Indian nationalists Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh, both of whom participated in the revolutionary movement for Indian independence. Prabhakaran never developed a systematic philosophy, but did declare that his goal was &#x27;revolutionary socialism and the creation of an egalitarian society&#x27;. His rare interviews, his annual Tamil Eelam Heroes Day speeches and the LTTE&#x27;s policies and actions can be taken as indicators of Prabhakaran&#x27;s philosophy and ideology. Religion was not a major factor in his philosophy or ideology; the Tamil Tigers&#x27; ideology emerged from Marxist-Leninist thought and was explicitly secular. Its leadership professed opposition to religion. It focused single-mindedly on attaining an independent Tamil Eelam. The following are important aspects of Prabhakaran&#x27;s philosophy and ideology.

===Eelam Tamil nationalism===
Prabhakaran is often seen as a martyr to the Eelam Tamil people. His source of inspiration and direction was Eelam Tamil nationalism, and his stated and ultimate ideal was to get Tamil Eelam recognised as a nation as per the U.N. Charter that guarantees the right of a people to political independence. The LTTE also proposed the formation of an Interim Self Governing Authority during Peace Negotiations in 2003. Former Tamil guerrilla and politician Dharmalingam Sithadthan has remarked that Prabhakaran&#x27;s &quot;dedication to the cause of the Tamil Eelam was unquestionable, he was the only man in Sri Lanka who could decide if there should be war or peace.&quot;
===Militarism of the LTTE===
Prabhakaran explicitly stated that an armed struggle is the only way to resist asymmetric warfare, in which one side, that of the Sri Lankan government, is armed and the other comparatively unarmed. He argued that he chose military means only after observing that non–violent means have been ineffectual and obsolete, especially after the Thileepan incident. Thileepan, a Lt. colonel rank officer adopted Gandhian means to protest against the IPKF killings by staging a fast unto death from 15 September 1987, and by abstaining from food or water until 26 September, when he died in front of thousands of Tamils who had come there to fast along with him.

Tactically, Prabhakaran perfected the recruitment and use of suicide bomber units. His fighters usually took no prisoners and were notorious for assaults that often left every single enemy soldier dead. Interpol described him as someone who was &quot;very alert, known to use disguise and capable of handling sophisticated weaponry and explosives.&quot; He was called a &quot;military genius&quot; by western military experts.

==Personal life==
Prabhakaran was married to Mathivathani Erambu on 1 October 1984. The military spokesman Udaya Nanayakkara said in May 2009 that there was no information about the whereabouts of the remaining members of Prabhakaran&#x27;s family. &quot;We have not found their bodies and have no information about them,&quot; he said. It is thought that the entire family was wiped out; the bodies of Mathivathani, Duvaraga and Balachandran reportedly were found in a bushy patch about 600 meters away from where Prabhakaran&#x27;s body was found. It is now alleged that his 12-year-old son was executed.

Prabhakaran&#x27;s parents, Thiruvenkadam Velupillai and Parvathi, both in their 70s, were found in the Menik Farm camp for displaced people near the town of Vavuniya. The Sri Lankan military and the government gave public assurances that they would not be interrogated, harmed or ill-treated. They were taken into Sri Lankan military custody until Vellupillai&#x27;s death in January 2010. Prabhakaran has a sister, Vinodini Rajendaran.

===Other names===
Prabhakaran had over the years built up the LTTE into a powerful movement running a shadow state and had acquired the status of being &quot;Thesiya Thalaivar&quot; (National Leader of the Land). He was called &quot;thambi&quot;, meaning &quot;younger brother&quot;, by Eelam Tamil elders, which was also his pet name since he was the youngest in his family. He was also called as &quot;Anna/Annai&quot;, meaning &#x27;elder brother&#x27; by his younger cadets and the younger Eelam Tamil people. Prabhakaran was also called &quot;Karikalan&quot; for his bravery and his administration (in reference to Karikala Chola, a famous Chola king who ruled in Sangam Age). He was additionally raised to divine status as &quot;Sooriyathevan&quot; (God of the Sun) by his followers. This was a title used by some of his supporters and within the LTTE to emphasize his leadership and charisma. It is important to note that Prabhakaran was a controversial figure and his moniker as &quot;Sooriyathevan&quot; was symbolic rather than a religious or widely accepted title.

<text>The year 1772 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events.

==Astronomy==
* Lagrange finds the special-case solution to the three-body problem that becomes known as the Lagrangian points.

==Cartography==
* Johann Heinrich Lambert publishes seven new map projections, including the Lambert conformal conic, transverse Mercator and Lambert azimuthal equal area.

==Chemistry==
* Daniel Rutherford isolates nitrogen.
* Joseph Priestley synthesizes nitrous oxide as &quot;phlogisticated nitrous air&quot;. Antoine Lavoisier privately presents his own views on phlogiston theory to the French Academy of Sciences.
* Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau demonstrates that metals gain weight on calcination.

==Earth sciences==
* The Central England temperature (CET) record begins daily measurements of mean surface air temperatures in the Midlands region of England.

==Mathematics==
* Euler confirms that formula_1 is a Mersenne prime.
* The Marquis de Condorcet publishes his second significant paper on integral calculus.

==Technology==
* May 28 – The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal opens for traffic throughout in England from a junction with the Trent and Mersey Canal to the River Severn at Stourport. Engineered by James Brindley, this is the first British trunk canal completed and its dimensions determine the size of boat used throughout the narrow canal network ( by ).
* Andrew Meikle invents spring sails for windmills.

==Publications==
* Joseph Priestley – &quot;The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours&quot; (&quot;Optics&quot;)

==Awards==

<text>Gleditsia (honey locust) is a genus of trees in the family Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae, native to the Americas and Asia. The Latin name commemorates Johann Gottlieb Gleditsch, director of the Berlin Botanical Garden, who died in 1786.

==Species==
There are 12 species:
*&quot;Gleditsia amorphoides&quot; (Griseb.) Taubert 
*&quot;Gleditsia aquatica&quot; Marshall – water locust or swamp locust
*&quot;Gleditsia assamica&quot; Bor
*&quot;Gleditsia australis&quot; F. B. Forbes &amp; Hemsley
*&quot;Gleditsia caspica&quot; Desf. – Caspian locust or Persian honeylocust
*&quot;Gleditsia fera&quot; (Lour.) Merr.
*&quot;Gleditsia japonica&quot; Miq. – Japanese honey locust
*&quot;Gleditsia medogensis&quot; Z.C.Ni
*&quot;Gleditsia microphylla&quot; D.Gordon ex Y.T.Lee
*&quot;Gleditsia rolfei&quot; S.Vidal
*&quot;Gleditsia sinensis&quot; Lam. – Chinese honey locust
*&quot;Gleditsia triacanthos&quot; L. – thorny honey locust

Hybrids
*&quot;Gleditsia&quot; × &quot;texana&quot; Sarg. – Texas honey locust (=&quot;G. aquatica&quot; × &quot;triacanthos)&quot;

All the species are woody except for &quot;G. microphylla&quot;. Their ability to fix nitrogen is debated; see .

== Range and taxonomy ==
&quot;Gleditsia&quot; is found in East Asia, on the East Coast of the Americas, and in South America; small populations of certain species also exist around the Caspian Sea (&quot;G. caspica&quot;) and India (&quot;G. assamica&quot;). There are native species to all these regions. The theory is that &quot;Gleditsia&quot; originated in East Asia in the Eocene, crossed the land bridge across the North Pacific Ocean into North America, and then spread down to South America millions of years later. &quot;Gymnocladus&quot; is a sister genus of &quot;Gleditsia,&quot; and it too mimicked this dispersion pattern, except it came to the Americas much earlier. Though there are no extant European &quot;Gleditsia&quot; species, there are fossils found in Europe which could mean that the genus also crossed the North Atlantic land bridge.

Certain &quot;Gleditsia&quot; species are in clades with species from other continents; an example is &quot;G. caspica&quot; (from the Caucusus), &quot;G. delavayi,&quot; and &quot;G. japonica&quot; (both from Asia), who are in a clade together. &quot;Gleditsia amorphoides&quot; is the most basal of the genus, most closely related to &quot;G. sinensis&quot; but not the North American species (&quot;G. aquatica&quot; and &quot;G. triacanthos&quot;).

==Medicinal use==
&quot;Gleditsia sinensis&quot; is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in Chinese herbology, where it is called &quot;zào jiá&quot; ().

<text>Robinia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, tribe Robinieae, native to North America. Commonly known as locusts, they are deciduous trees and shrubs growing tall. The leaves are pinnate with 7–21 oval leaflets. The flowers are white or pink, in usually pendulous racemes. Many species have thorny shoots, and several have sticky hairs on the shoots.

The genus is named after the royal French gardeners Jean Robin and his son Vespasien Robin, who introduced the plant to Europe in 1601.

The number of species is disputed between different authorities, with as few as four recognised by some authors, while others recognise up to 10 species. Several natural hybrids are also known.

Some species of &quot;Robinia&quot; are used as food by caterpillars of Lepidoptera, including such moths as the brown-tail (&quot;Euproctis chrysorrhoea&quot;), the buff-tip (&quot;Phalera bucephala&quot;), the engrailed (&quot;Ectropis crepuscularia&quot;), the giant leopard moth (&quot;Hypercompe scribonia&quot;), the locust underwing (&quot;Euparthenos nubilis&quot;), and Gracillariidae leaf miners like &quot;Chrysaster ostensackenella&quot;, &quot;Macrosaccus robiniella&quot; and &quot;Parectopa robiniella&quot;.

== Toxicity ==
All species produce toxic lectins, throughout the entire plant, with the exception of the flowers.
The flowers are used in teas and in pancakes, and are consumed as fritters in many parts of Europe.

==Paleontology==
* The fossilised bones of a huge animal (later identified as a Mosasaur) are found in a quarry near Maastricht in the Netherlands.

==Technology==
* July – James Hargreaves obtains a British patent for the spinning jenny.
* The Spring scale was created by Richard Salter.

==Awards==
* Copley Medal: William Hamilton

==Births==
* April 9 – Thomas Johann Seebeck, Baltic German physicist (died 1831)
* April 18 – William Nicol, Scottish geologist (died 1851)
* November 5 – Sarah Guppy, English inventor (died 1852)

==Deaths==
* April 25 – Abbé Jean-Antoine Nollet, French physicist (born 1700)
* July 21 – Charlotta Frölich, Swedish agronomist and historian (born 1698)
* September 9 – Bernhard Siegfried Albinus, German-born anatomist in Holland (born 1697)
* December 5 – James Stirling, Scottish mathematician (born 1692)

<text>Eivind Groven (8 October 1901 – 8 February 1977) was a Norwegian composer and music-theorist. He was from the traditional region of Vest-Telemark and had a background in the folk music of the area.

== Biography ==
Groven was born in the village of Lårdal in Telemark, Norway. Groven&#x27;s rural background was filled with traditional music. He came from a family of talented musicians and artists, prominent in his home area. His father, Olav Åsmundsson Gjøitil (1865–1947) was the youngest of eight siblings. Two of his father&#x27;s brothers played the hardanger fiddle. His mother, Aslaug Rikardsdotter Berge (1863–1946), was the youngest daughter of Rikard Aslaksson Berge, known for preserving a great amount of old tunes, religious songs and dance-tunes and a friend of Myllarguten&#x27;s. Two of Groven&#x27;s maternal uncles also played the hardanger fiddle, and his mother&#x27;s sisters, as well as Aslaug herself, were talented folk singers.

Groven was the youngest of five brothers. Two of his brothers began to play the fiddle, and soon Eivind joined them. His father Olav was also an apt player, and in their childhood, the brothers learned notes, and sometimes played together, when they got their hands on classical sheet music. Otherwise, local folk music ruled. As Eivind grew up, he understood the value of writing down the tunes he heard from other fiddlers, and in this way, he soon gained great knowledge. At the age of 16, Groven was infected with a serious case of wet gangrene in the lungs and barely survived it. During his reconvalescent period, he studied music and played the fiddle. He later recalled: &quot;I was free to do whatever I wished in that time&quot;.

Eivind Groven studied at Notodden to become a teacher, but soon abandoned this. Starting in the autumn of 1925, he studied musical theory and composition at the Oslo Conservatory of Music mostly Berlioz and Beethoven. He held Beethoven in highest esteem for the rest of his life, and wished for the 9th symphony anthem to be played at his funeral. Unlike many other young Norwegian composers at the time, he refused to go abroad, but stayed at home composing, and developing his own distinct musical forms, based on a merging of the sonata form with the special metamorphic principles unique to the dance music from Telemark, closely related to the forms of late baroque.

In 1931, Groven was appointed by the Norwegian Broadcasting Company, NRK, to be responsible for half an hour of folk music every week. This allowed him to broadcast many rural musicians to the radio, helping to preserve the folk music for posterity. Reactions from the urban public were harsh and unfriendly. Debates intensified, and people living in Oslo mostly expressed their disgust for this &quot;barbaric music&quot;. Groven worked on, said little, as was his way, but it is known that he silently burnt all the hate-mail. He received great and valuable support from his original rural community, and from his family.

From 1938 and into World War II, Groven started his work on just intonation, which resulted in his special organ, completed in 1952. Albert Schweitzer wrote to Groven and wished he could try this organ, and when he was granted the Nobel Peace Prize, he seized the opportunity. He exclaimed that a great organ had to be built.

During the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Groven resigned his post in NRK after a brief and unwelcome encounter in his studio with Joseph Goebbels. After WWII, Groven participated in editing and publishing seven volumes of written and collected tunes for hardanger fiddle, along with two fellow folk musicians in Norway. The work was completed after their deaths. Groven was the brother-in-law of author Ingeborg Refling Hagen (1895–1989). This resulted in a fruitful artistic relationship and Groven created music based on the texts written by his sister-in-law. Groven continued composing, and was in later years greatly admired for his musical style and his use of the orchestra.

=== Folk music ===
Eivind Groven began writing down fiddle tunes from an early age. During his life, he collected some 2000 fiddle tunes from various parts of the country. He worked as a consultant in NRK, and here, he was instrumental in creating a folk music archive, and in getting the company proper facilities for recording. The first recordings are dated 1936. From those recordings, he wrote down a number of tunes.

In 1954, a committee was formed for editing and publication of Norwegian folk music in print. The result of this work is a seven volume series of Norwegian Hardanger fiddle tunes, finished after Groven&#x27;s death. In this work, Groven was the central expert, editing and piecing together tunes into larger groups, regular families of dance tunes. The work would have been impossible without his contribution, and he worked on this until he was unable to write anymore, about 1973. The financial compensation for this was sparse, and the project was nearly shut down. When the other members of the committee died, Groven worked on alone.

== Musical style ==
Groven&#x27;s musical style is heavily influenced by his folk music background, both harmonic and formal. The blue notes common in folk music were often compensated in classical orchestra through imaginative use of overtones and in orchestration. Groven&#x27;s harmonies reflects often the harmonies of the hardanger fiddle, which is commonly played on two or even three strings at a time. He also extracted harmonies from the Norwegian cither, the langeleik, and the willow flute.

It has been pointed out that Groven&#x27;s harmonic principles are not far from the principles of the early Flemish Renaissance composers, such as Dufay and Jacob Obrecht. Like them, he often uses the sixth-chord, with a third at the bottom. Groven often thinks rather polyphonically, and this can also be traced to the hardanger fiddle, as well as to his admiration for Bach.

In early years, critics accused him of atonality, but in fact, Groven&#x27;s music is quite tonal. He can, however use drastic modulations, which in this context turn out as fairly logical. Apart from this, he uses the old modes that are present in traditional Norwegian music. One has to remember, though, that he never heard much of the early Flemish music, or even his older contemporary Stravinsky, and yet similarities can be found. Those similarities can be explained out of tonal feeling and tradition. Stravinsky in the early stage of his production used Russian folk music in an experimental way, like Groven.

Groven&#x27;s form is metamorphic. He often uses a kind of fortspinnung, and turns themes over to new themes gradually, in a very organic way.
Groven did not believe in the concept of absolute music. He stated rather that &quot;all music is about something&quot;. Thus, one will find that most of his works are based on literature, poems or novels, or even plays. He wrote a number of songs over poems written by Henrik Wergeland, and choral works based on texts by the Norwegian novelist and playwright Hans E. Kinck (1865–1926) and poet Ingeborg Refling Hagen. His piano concerto and two symphonies are also based on works by the latter two authors.

Groven also composed music for hardanger fiddle, experimenting with new ways of tuning the instrument, and wrote a number of folk tune arrangements for his own organ, using blue scales and irregular intervals, not to be achieved on a regular equal-tempered piano.
He wrote also a number of essays on the topics of pure tuning and the overtone scale, as well as an essay of his own invention, the pure-tuning automath.

==Personal life==
In 1925, Groven married Ragna Hagen (1902–1960). He and Ragna had four children, Aslaug, Tone, Dagne and Gudmund. His older brother Olav Groven, an equally talented folk musician, died from pneumonia in 1928. His first wife Ragna died in 1960 and Groven was remarried two years later to Signe Taraldlien from Telemark. In the end, she outlived him by twenty years.

Groven developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1964, and had to put away the fiddle. The medications available at the time caused undue stress to his heart, and he died at the age of 75 in Oslo during the winter of 1977. He is buried alongside his first wife in the cemetery at Tangen Church in Hedmark.

<doc id="445677" wikidata="Q7301202" url="?curid=445677" title="Realignment (sports)">
<text>In North American sports, realignment or releaguing refers to a major change in the competitive structure of one or more existing leagues. The mechanics differ somewhat between amateur and professional sports.

==Professional sports==
In professional sports, this occurs when a league decides to change which teams are in which divisions, usually by creating new divisions. In all of the four major North American sports leagues, all of the teams are grouped into one of two conferences (or leagues in baseball) while each conference/league is further subdivided into divisions. Teams in the same division play each other more regularly than teams in the same conference, and much more often than teams in the other conference. Teams from the same division can form intense rivalries. The top team from a division is always guaranteed a playoff spot and guaranteed a higher seeding in the playoffs. Divisions are usually based on geography, both to minimise travel costs and to encourage regional rivalries.

Divisions are not always static. Sometimes a team may relocate to a new city, and as a result the division may become geographically skewed. For instance, when the Atlanta Thrashers of the NHL became the Winnipeg Jets in 2011, they would have been a team from a northwestern city playing in the Southeast Division, but the NHL chose not to realign at this time, leading to lengthy road trips for the Jets and the other teams in their division.

Also, divisions need to be roughly equal in size to ensure that each team has an equal chance of becoming division champion. When a league introduces new teams in new markets, placing them in the division best suited to their geography may result in more teams in that division, so realignment is necessary. The 1969 baseball realignment coincided with the addition of four teams, whereas its 1994 realignment creating extra divisions in both the American League and the National League came a year after the league added the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins. The National Football League realigned to its current eight-division format after a series of team relocations had created geographically skewed divisions.

Sometimes a sport will favor old division rivalries over geographical consistency. The rivalries the Dallas Cowboys of the NFL maintain with the teams of the eastern seaboard, especially the Washington Commanders, meant they were kept in an eastern division after realignment, even though they are geographically dissimilar to their division rivals.

==College sports==
In college sports, the term &quot;realignment&quot; is used to refer to a situation in which large numbers of schools switch their conference affiliation in a short period of time. Especially in the top level of college sports, NCAA Division I, several schools change their affiliations in one or more sports every year. However, the term is usually reserved for situations which affect large numbers of conferences—most notably in 1996, 2005, 2010–2014, and most recently the 2020s.

Each of the four realignment periods below was driven mainly by one or a few conferences:
*1996: Formation of the Big 12 and CUSA, expansion of the WAC (which split up only three years later)
*2005: Expansion of the ACC
*2010: Expansion of the Big Ten, Pac-12, and SEC, plus further expansion of the ACC, leading to a concurrent reduction in the number of Big 12 members and the split of the Big East Conference
** A separate but related phase that involved only men&#x27;s ice hockey was triggered by Penn State adding the sport, enabling the Big Ten to start a men&#x27;s ice hockey league. This led to the demise of the original CCHA, the creation of the NCHC, and major membership turnover in the WCHA.
*2021:
** First phase: Further expansion of the SEC, leading to sweeping changes in the Big 12 membership that cascaded through most D-I conferences
*** In ice hockey, the revival of the CCHA by seven schools that left the men&#x27;s side of the WCHA, leading to the WCHA becoming a women-only league
** Second phase: Started with the announced move of the two most prominent Pac-12 programs to the Big Ten, and later followed by eight more Pac-12 members announcing their departure for other conferences, resulting in that league&#x27;s effective demise</text><links>

<text>The Connecticut warbler (Oporornis agilis) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family.

==Description==
These medium-sized warblers measure in length, with a wingspan. Connecticut warblers weigh when they fledge, attaining an average weight of around as adults. However, birds preparing for migration pack on more weight to survive the strenuous journey and can weigh up to . This species has light yellow underparts and olive upperparts; they have a light eye-ring, pink legs, a long tail, and a thin pointed bill. Males have a grey hood; females and immatures are more brown and have a whitish throat.

They forage on the ground, picking among dead leaves, or hop along branches. Like most warblers, these birds mainly eat insects and similar small invertebrates. Specifically, they eat spiders, snails, and caterpillars. They will also supplement their diet occasionally with seeds and berries. They are &quot;skulking&quot; birds that usually spend their time foraging within dense, low vegetation. Such behavior often renders them difficult to see well.

Despite its name, this bird only rarely visits Connecticut during migration. It was named by Alexander Wilson who observed the first classified specimen. They are fairly elusive birds, but it appears that their numbers may be declining due to loss of winter habitat.

==Taxonomy==
Most classification systems consider the genus to be monophyletic. It used to be considered paraphyletic, and it was paired with the mourning, Kentucky, and MacGillivray&#x27;s warblers in the genus &quot;Oporornis&quot;. However, recent studies have found that these three warblers were more closely related to the yellowthroats which belong to the genus &quot;Geothlypis&quot;.

== Habitat ==
Their breeding habitat is bogs or open deciduous woods near water, especially with poplar, spruce, tamarack or aspen, in central Canada and states bordering the Great Lakes. These habitats tend to be in rather remote areas that are hard to access for fieldwork; therefore, there is little data available on this species of birds. The nest is an open cup well-concealed in moss or a clump of grass. It is made of &quot;dry grasses, stalk of weeds, and horsehairs&quot;.

== Breeding ==
Courtship begins right after the migrants arrive on their breeding grounds. It correlates with the time when males start to sing as this is how they court females. Couples have one brood per season. Connecticut warblers like to nest in thick understory where their young are protected from predators. Most lay in mid-June, though some populations have been observed to lay in July. Their eggs have a creamy color and they are speckled and blotched with chestnut and bay. Only females incubate. Fledglings are observed in late July and at the latest at the end of August. Both parents feed their young caterpillars, larvae, moths, and berries.

== Vocalization ==
The song of this bird is a loud repeated &quot;&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;similar in pitch to the Kentucky warbler and the Ovenbird&quot;. The call is a nasal &quot;pitch&quot;, it sounds like a raspy &quot;witch&quot;. Like many songbirds, its song is heard during the breeding season but rarely during the fall.

== Behavior ==
The Connecticut warbler walks on the ground to forage insects and other sources of food. Its tail bobs up and down, which is reminiscent of wren and sandpiper behaviour. When it comes to sociability, the Connecticut warbler is a solitary species; however, groups of about twenty-five will come together in the fall before migration. It also will join other species, such as Blackpoll warblers, to feed during the fall. Males are highly territorial during breeding season, they defend an area which ranges from 0.24–0.48 hectares. When it comes to parental care, both the male and the female will feed the juvenile. They will defend their young by screeching at predators.

== Migration ==
As mentioned earlier, the Connecticut warbler is an elusive species. Little is known about it outside of the breeding season as to this date, less than 25,000 individuals have been banded. These birds migrate to the Amazon Basin in South America in winter. Specimens have been observed in Colombia (north &amp; southeast), Venezuela (northeast &amp; interior), Guyana (at the border), and Peru (South). Connecticut warblers undertake different migratory routes in spring and in fall, an atypical behavior. In spring, they normally pass through the Midwest and only rarely migrate to the East Coast, but in fall, larger numbers of migrating birds move through the East Coast. Recently, the use of small tracking devices has enabled scientists to gather more data on the warbler&#x27;s migration routes. They have discovered some individuals fly over open water like the Blackpoll warbler. More specifically, they recorded a previously undocumented two-day flight over the Caribbean to the Antilles. This correlates with sightings of Connecticut warblers that have occurred in Bermuda, St. Thomas and St Martin. Haiti on the island of Hispaniola is also a popular stop, but records there are hard to find due to the terrain being rather remote and past humanitarian crises; it is also additionally threatened by the ongoing deforestation in both Haiti and the Dominican Republic. There, they make a minimum of 48-hour stop (it usually lasts 5–7 days) in the Caribbean. This long migration over open water calls for strong selective pressures. A comparative study between the Connecticut warbler and the blackpoll warbler could help determine what selective pressures are present in these two species. This kind of migration also demands large reserves of fuel and this is why fat Connecticut warblers can be found on the East Coast in early fall. It&#x27;s also the reason why they make several stopovers on their way South.

== Current threats ==
One of the main causes of mortality during migration is the collision of individuals into man-made structures. Collisions often occur against transparent glass panes, through which individuals can see vegetation and light. Habitat destruction is another threat to Connecticut warbler populations. Aspen logging on their breeding range (i.e. BC) and the application of pesticides get rid of nesting locations. The infestation of budworms on jack-pine trees also puts nesting sites at risk. The presence of power lines is also a danger to the Connecticut warbler: studies show that the presence of power lines reduces population densities in areas where they are present. In Alberta breeding sites, noise disturbances from gas pipelines are detrimental to the species as well. Studies show that Connecticut warblers did well in forests that have been cleared off of shrubs and understory as they prefer trees; however, their abundance decreased in areas where the forest was clear-cut. Connecticut warblers are on the IUCN red list as a species of Least Concern. Nevertheless, some of its populations in Saskatchewan, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin are at risk. Conservation efforts are difficult due to a lack of research, though a handful of researchers have written some management plans, focusing on the preservation of woody wetlands, which are the Connecticut warbler&#x27;s favored habitat.

<text>Elmer Eric Schattschneider (August 11, 1892 – March 4, 1971) was an American political scientist.

== Life and career ==
Schattschneider was born in Bethany, Minnesota. He received his AB at the University of Wisconsin, MA at the University of Pittsburgh, and his PhD at Columbia University. He taught at Columbia, the New Jersey College for Women (now a section of Rutgers University), and Wesleyan University (1930–1960). Schattschneider was president of the American Political Science Association between 1956 and 1957 and is the namesake of its award for the best dissertation in the field of American politics. He died in Old Saybrook, Connecticut.

== Publications ==
Schattschneider&#x27;s books include &quot;Politics, Pressures and the Tariff&quot; (1935), &quot;Party Government&quot; (1942), &quot;The Struggle for Party Government&quot;, (1948), &quot;Equilibrium and Change in American Politics&quot; (1958), &quot;The Semisovereign People: A Realist&#x27;s View of Democracy in America&quot; (1960) (for a discussion see: Mair, 1997), and &quot;Two Hundred Million Americans in Search of a Government&quot; (1969).

== Critique of pluralism ==
Along with the political scientist Theodore J. Lowi, Schattschneider offered perhaps &quot;the most devastating&quot; critique of the American political theory of pluralism: Rather than an essentially democratic system in which the many competing interests of citizens are amply represented, if not advanced, by equally many competing interest groups, Schattschneider argued the pressure system is biased in favor of &quot;the most educated and highest-income members of society&quot;, and showed that &quot;the difference between those who participate in interest group activity and those who stand at the sidelines is much greater than that between voters and nonvoters.&quot;

In &quot;The Semisovereign People&quot;, Schattschneider argued the scope of the pressure system is really quite small: The &quot;range of organized, identifiable, known groups is amazingly narrow; there is nothing remotely universal about it&quot; and the &quot;business or upper-class bias of the pressure system shows up everywhere.&quot; He says the &quot;notion that the pressure system is automatically representative of the whole community is a myth&quot; and, instead, the &quot;system is skewed, loaded and unbalanced in favor of a fraction of a minority.&quot; And &quot;the flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper-class accent.&quot;

<doc id="445706" wikidata="Q589751" url="?curid=445706" title="Project Gotham Racing (video game)">
<text>Project Gotham Racing is a 2001 arcade-style racing video game developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Microsoft Game Studios, released exclusively for the Xbox console as a launch title. It serves as the spiritual successor to Bizarre&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis Street Racer&quot; and retains the Kudos system, which awards points for driving skills and style, necessary for progression rather than solely finishing races in first place. Races occur across four real-world cities, featuring a total of 204 unique circuits. The game achieved both critical and commercial success, launching the exclusive &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; series that continued with &quot;Project Gotham Racing 2&quot; in 2003.

==Gameplay== 
&quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; features three main game modes: Kudos Challenge, Quick Race, and Arcade Race. The Kudos Challenge comprises various style events in which players can earn a gold, silver, or bronze medal by successfully achieving a specific amount of Kudos. These events include, but are not limited to, Style Challenges, where players navigate through sets of traffic cones on the track; Overtake, which requires players to surpass as many cars as possible; and Speed Challenge, where players must ensure their speedometer hits a designated target. Quick Race involves competing in various races against five computer opponents, while Arcade Race consists of an additional collection of style challenges.

=== Kudos System === 
Advancement in &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot;, distinct from other racing games, requires players to drive fast enough to meet the challenges set while also scoring sufficient Kudos points to progress. Kudos points are earned through various driving skills, such as power sliding around corners at high speed, driving on two wheels, or overtaking non-player characters during the race. The longer a stunt is maintained, the more points the player receives. However, colliding with the guard rails or other obstacles will result in the loss of Kudos points earned from that stunt.

=== Content === 
There are a total of 29 licensed cars in &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot;, ranging from the initially available Mini Cooper-S, Toyota MR2 Spyder, and Mercedes-Benz SLK 320 to the high-end Ferrari F50 and Porsche Carrera GT. Visible car damage, such as bumps, is present when the player&#x27;s car is hit; however, this is purely aesthetic and does not affect driving performance.

The game features four realistically recreated world cities: San Francisco, London, and Tokyo, which all return from &quot;Metropolis Street Racer&quot;, alongside the newly introduced New York City. Each city is divided into three distinct districts (e.g., Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf), and every district contains 17 circuits, resulting in a total of 204 configurations.

The game features 12 radio stations, five of which are based on real-life stations (HOT 97, Live 105, Capital 95.8, Xfm London 104.9, and InterFM), featuring the voices of real DJs such as Angie Martinez. The soundtrack is diverse, including Japanese language tracks and selections from obscure and underground artists.

== Development and Release == 
Bizarre Creations did not receive the financial return from &quot;Metropolis Street Racer&quot;, which was over-budget, late to market, and released shortly before the discontinuation of the Dreamcast hardware. Initially, Microsoft asked Bizarre for a conversion to their upcoming Xbox, but the developers decided to evolve the game further to create a &quot;worthy&quot; launch title, requiring a name change since the original title was owned by Sega.

The game was unveiled under the tentative title &quot;Project Gotham&quot; at Gamestock 2001 on March 13 of that year. The demo presented was an early build, although the fundamentals of the game were already established. The development team took over 50,000 photographs in the four real-life cities to capture every detail and design the game&#x27;s environments as accurately as possible. The team was also dedicated to ensuring the game ran smoothly at 60 frames per second, even with split-screen multiplayer. &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; was the first racing game since &quot;Need for Speed: High Stakes&quot; to officially secure both the Ferrari and Porsche licenses. Compared to &quot;Metropolis Street Racer&quot;, many high-end exotic cars were added to &quot;Project Gotham&quot;.

The Kudos mechanic also underwent slight changes in &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot;, with points awarded based on the best attempt from multiple tries, rather than the risk-and-reward system used in &quot;Metropolis Street Racer&quot;.

&quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; received favorable reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. &quot;NextGen&quot; stated that the game &quot;has enough gloss, variety, and originality to compete with the genre&#x27;s best and give speedfreaks a great reason to jump on the Xbox bandwagon.&quot;

In 2005, then-chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, described &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; as his favorite game.

=== Accolades === 
The game was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Xbox Game&quot; and, among console games, &quot;Best Driving Game&quot; awards; these honors ultimately went to &quot;&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec&quot;, respectively. During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; for the &quot;Console Racing&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec&quot;.

=== Sales === 
The game sold over 1 million units globally by July 2002, making it the joint-second best-selling game (alongside &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;) to reach this milestone after &quot;&quot;. By July 2006, it had sold 1.2 million copies and earned $44 million in the U.S. &quot;NextGen&quot; ranked it as the 43rd highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, or GameCube in the U.S. between January 2000 and July 2006. Combined sales of the &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; franchise reached 2.1 million units in the U.S. by July 2006.
== Legacy and series == 

&quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; launched a series that became Microsoft&#x27;s flagship racing game franchise on Xbox. The final main title, &quot;Project Gotham Racing 4&quot;, was released around the time Bizarre Creations was acquired by Activision. Following this acquisition, Bizarre Creations announced that &quot;PGR4&quot; would be the last game produced for Microsoft, effectively leading to &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot; replacing it as Xbox&#x27;s flagship racing franchise.

<doc id="445710" wikidata="Q1272578" url="?curid=445710" title="Sharpe (novel series)">
<text>Sharpe is a series of historical fiction stories by Bernard Cornwell centred on the character of English soldier Richard Sharpe. The stories formed the basis for an ITV television series featuring Sean Bean in the title role.

Cornwell&#x27;s series is composed of many novels and several short stories, and charts Sharpe&#x27;s progress in the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars, though the novels were published in non-chronological order. He begins in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Tiger&quot; as a private in the 33rd Regiment of Foot who is continually promoted, finally rising to lieutenant colonel in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Waterloo&quot;. His military career ends with the final defeat of Napoleon, but he has more adventures as a civilian.

Sharpe is born to a prostitute in the rookeries of London. Orphaned at an early age, he grows up in poverty. He is eventually taken in by prostitute (and later bar owner) Maggie Joyce and becomes a thief. He has to flee the city after killing a man to protect Maggie.

Enlisting in the army, he is promoted to sergeant as a reward for completing a highly dangerous espionage-mission in India. He is made an officer, an ensign, when he saves the life of his commanding officer, Arthur Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington), during the Battle of Assaye. It is a mixed blessing, as he constantly has to fight class-prejudice in an army where an officer&#x27;s rank is often purchased without regard to qualification. Cornwell sees to it that he is improbably present at many important battles of the British Empire at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, including the Battle of Waterloo.

Sharpe is described as &quot;brilliant but wayward&quot; in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Sword&quot;, and he is portrayed by the author as a &quot;loose cannon&quot;. He becomes a highly skilled and experienced leader of light troops. In contrast to the honourable Horatio Hornblower - the inspiration for the series - Sharpe is a rogue, an unabashed thief and murderer who has no qualms about killing a bitter enemy when the opportunity arises. However, he is protective of women in general and has a number of lovers over the course of his life.

He is six-feet tall, with an angular, tanned face, long black hair, and blue eyes. He has a deep scar on his right cheek which pulls at his right eye, giving his face a mocking expression when relaxed; this disappears when he smiles, which is not too frequently. By the end of the series, he has had two wives and three children.

==Inspiration==
Cornwell had enjoyed C. S. Forester&#x27;s Horatio Hornblower novels, which depict a Royal Navy officer&#x27;s career from midshipman to Admiral of the Fleet and retirement. When he could not find a similar series for the British Army, he decided to write it himself. As a further inducement, he had fallen in love with an American woman who, for various reasons, could not leave the United States, so he relocated. He could not get a green card or work permit, so he wrote the first Sharpe novel to make a living.

Struggling to come up with a name as distinctive as Horatio Hornblower, he used a placeholder based on the rugby union player Richard Sharp; eventually, he kept it, just adding an &quot;e&quot;. The author had intended to write 11 novels, the same number as in the Hornblower series, ending with &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Waterloo&quot;, but later changed his mind and continued writing.

==Sean Bean==
Sean Bean played Sharpe in the British television series &quot;Sharpe&quot;. Cornwell was so impressed with Bean&#x27;s portrayal that he expanded Sharpe&#x27;s backstory to have him growing up in Yorkshire to account for Bean&#x27;s accent. The author also avoided further mention of Sharpe&#x27;s black hair (Bean&#x27;s hair being blond). Bean took over the part from British actor Paul McGann, who more closely resembled Cornwell&#x27;s description, when the latter was injured playing football during filming of the first episode.

==Fictional biography==
===Early life===
Richard Sharpe is born in London circa 1777 (he believes that he may be 22 during the early months of 1799) to a prostitute residing in &quot;Cat Lane&quot; and possibly a French smuggler. When Sharpe is three, his mother is killed in the Gordon Riots.

With no known relatives to raise him, Sharpe is deposited in Jem Hocking&#x27;s foundling home at Brewhouse Lane, Wapping, where he spends his days picking his assigned quota of oakum. He is malnourished and regularly beaten, resulting in his being undersized for his age. Because of this, he is eventually sold to a master chimney sweep to train as an apprentice at the relatively late age of 12. Fearing the high mortality rate among apprentice sweeps (who are forced to climb inside chimneys and remove soot by hand), Sharpe flees to the Rookery, a slum in St Giles, and is taken in by prostitute (and later bar owner) Maggie Joyce. He stays under Maggie&#x27;s protection for three years, learning various forms of thieving. Maggie is his first lover.

After killing a gang leader during a fight over Maggie, he flees from London to Yorkshire at the age of fifteen. He works in a tavern in Sheffield. Within six months, Sharpe kills a second man, the landlord of the tavern where he is working, in a fight over a local girl.

To avoid arrest, Sharpe takes the &quot;King&#x27;s shilling&quot;, joining the 33rd Foot, as a result of the blandishments of recruiting sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill. The regiment is first sent to Flanders in 1794, where Sharpe fights in his first battle, at Boxtel. The next year, he and his regiment are posted to India, under the command of the British East India Company.

===India===
In 1799, Sergeant Hakeswill goads Sharpe into striking him. Sharpe is sentenced to 2,000 lashes (effectively a death sentence), but is released after only 200 by executive order (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Tiger&quot;). He is assigned to accompany Lieutenant William Lawford on a secret mission to rescue Lawford&#x27;s uncle, Colonel Hector McCandless, the head of British East India Company intelligence. They join Tipu Sultan&#x27;s army, posing as British deserters, but are later exposed and imprisoned. Lawford teaches Sharpe to read and write whilst they languish in a dungeon. Sharpe escapes during the siege of Seringapatam and prematurely detonates a mine meant to devastate the British army when it breaches the city wall. The British take the city. He then kills the fleeing Tipu unobserved during the fighting and loots a fortune in jewels from the corpse. He is promoted to sergeant for his efforts.

Sharpe serves four uneventful years as a sergeant. In 1803, he is the sole survivor of a massacre of the garrison of a small fort carried out by a turncoat East India Company officer, William Dodd (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Triumph&quot;). Because he can identify Dodd, Sharpe is taken along by McCandless on a mission to capture and punish the renegade, to discourage others from deserting. Their search takes them first to battles at Ahmednuggur and then Assaye.

At Assaye, the greatly outnumbered British force is commanded by Arthur Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington). When Wellesley&#x27;s orderly is killed, by chance Sharpe is the only one available to take his place, and so is at hand when Wellesley is unhorsed alone and among the enemy. Sharpe single-handedly saves the general&#x27;s life, killing about half a dozen enemy soldiers and holding the rest at bay until help arrives. Wellesley rewards him with a battlefield commission as an ensign for his act of bravery, though Wellesley is certain it will not turn out well. Sharpe joins the 74th Regiment.

Sharpe receives a cold welcome from many of his fellow officers, who dislike him due to his low birth, and the common soldiers, who resent being commanded by someone from their own ranks, and he has great difficulty adjusting to his new status and role. In the end, the commander of the 74th pressures him to transfer to the newly formed 95th Rifles Regiment. Before leaving India, he takes part in the assault on Gawilghur, leading troops in action for the first time. Sharpe finds a way into the nearly impregnable fortress, ignoring the orders of his cowardly commanding officer. Once inside, he confronts and kills Dodd, at the cost of a scar on his right cheek (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Fortress&quot;). (Cornwell apologised for sometimes forgetting which side of Sharpe&#x27;s face is scarred; in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, for example, it is on the left.)

===Campaigns in Europe===
While sailing from India to England to take up his post in the 95th Rifles, in 1805, Sharpe is caught up in the Battle of Trafalgar, his first direct encounter with Napoleonic France as an infantry officer. On the journey, he meets and falls in love with Lady Grace Hale, the wife of an ambitious and powerful politician, the much older Lord William Hale (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Trafalgar&quot;). During the sea battle, Lord Hale confronts his wife, having discovered her infidelity. She kills him in self-defence. Sharpe has the body taken on deck so that it will appear as if Lord Hale died in the fighting.

Grace sets up home with Sharpe at Shorncliffe, but dies giving birth to their child, who survives her by only a few hours. Sharpe&#x27;s fortune (from selling Tipu Sultan&#x27;s jewels) is seized by lawyers who believe it to be part of Grace&#x27;s estate.

He falls into a deep depression, worsened by his bad relationship with his commanding officer, who relegates him to the role of quartermaster. He is left behind when the regiment is posted to the Baltic in 1807. Sharpe, unable to sell his commission (due to it not having been purchased), considers deserting.

He returns to Wapping and robs and kills Jem Hocking, the abusive master of the foundling home where Sharpe was raised. He fortuitously encounters General David Baird, a former colleague from India. Baird recruits him to protect John Lavisser, a Foreign Office agent being sent to secretly negotiate with the Danish Crown Prince to keep the Danish fleet out of French hands. Lavisser betrays Sharpe, who goes into hiding in Copenhagen. He witnesses the British bombardment of the city and provides valuable assistance in the capture of the Danish fleet (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Prey&quot;). Sharpe considers settling down there, having fallen in love with Astrid, the daughter of Ole Skovgaard, the chief spy for the British in Denmark. However, Skovgaard turns against the British because of their attack, and Astrid obeys his order to break up with Sharpe.

By early 1809, Sharpe is in Spain with the 95th Rifles, his men serving as the rearguard of the retreat to Corunna. When Captain Murray is mortally wounded, he leaves his heavy cavalry sword to Sharpe, giving him his signature weapon, used in all the subsequent books. Cut off from the main body of the army, he takes command of a handful of mutinous riflemen (including future best friend Patrick Harper), while protecting a small party of English missionaries. He encounters Spanish Major Blas Vivar and his partisans and reluctantly helps them temporarily seize control of the city of Santiago de Compostela so that Vivar can raise a sacred gonfalon to bolster the Spanish people&#x27;s flagging morale (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Rifles&quot;). Sharpe&#x27;s surviving riflemen who begin the retreat to Corunna are:

After making their way to Portugal, and taking part in the Battle of the Douro, Sharpe and his surviving 30 riflemen are attached to the Light Company of the South Essex Regiment (a fictional regiment) as part of Wellesley&#x27;s Peninsula Army. Some of the men Sharpe commands in the South Essex are:

* Pte Peters
* Pte Kirby
* Pte Gutteridge
* Pte Roach
* Pte Batten
* Pte Clayton (killed at Waterloo)
* Pte Dobbs
* Pte Mellors
* Pte Farrell
* Pte Paddock
* Pte Angel
* Cpl Jackson
* Sgt Read
* Sgt McGivern
* Sgt Huckfield (lost a finger at Waterloo)
* Sgt Charlie Weller
* Sgt Obadiah Hakeswill (executed for his many war crimes)
* RSM Maclaird
* Ens Denny
* Ens Mattews (murdered by Hakeswill)
* Ens Collip
* Ens Jack Bullen
* Ens Iliffe
* Ens McDonald
* Lt Michael Trumper-Jones 
* Cpt Robert Knowles (murdered by Obadiah Hakeswill)
* Cpt Carline (killed at Waterloo) 
* Cpt Smith (killed at Waterloo) 
* Maj Harry Price
* Maj Peter D&#x27;Alembord (loses a leg at Waterloo)

Sharpe takes part in a number of notable actions, either with the South Essex or on detached duty for Wellesley&#x27;s spymaster, Captain Michael Hogan of the Royal Engineers. These include capturing a French Imperial Eagle at the Battle of Talavera in 1809 (fulfilling a promise to a dying captain he respects), and the storming of the breach at Badajoz. He also takes an active role in the first siege of Almeida, the battles of Bussaco, Barossa, Ciudad Rodrigo, Fuentes de Onoro, Salamanca, Vitoria, and Toulouse. Over this period, he rises in rank from lieutenant to captain to major, eventually taking unofficial command of the entire regiment. Sharpe&#x27;s Irish friend Harper rises from rifleman to regimental sergeant major.

His intelligence work for Wellesley brings him the long-lasting enmity of the fictional French spymaster Pierre Ducos, who conspires several times to destroy Sharpe&#x27;s career, reputation or life.

Prior to the Battle of Waterloo, Sharpe is appointed aide to the Prince of Orange, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Disgusted by the Prince&#x27;s dangerous incompetence during the course of the battle, Sharpe deserts his post (making an attempt on the prince&#x27;s life afterwards), but comes to the aid of his old regiment, steadying the line and preventing a French breakthrough. Wellesley then gives him command of the unit for the remainder of the battle (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Waterloo&quot;).

Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, Sharpe ends up in Paris with the occupying allied armies. There he uncovers and defeats a secret Bonapartist group (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Assassin&quot;). Afterwards, he retires from the army.

===Retirement===
In 1820, Sharpe, living as a farmer in Normandy, is commissioned by the Countess of Mouromorto to find her husband, Don Blas Vivar, who has disappeared in the Spanish colony of Chile; both she and her husband had become acquainted with Sharpe in 1809, during the events leading up to the assault on Santiago de Compostella. Sharpe and Patrick Harper travel to South America. En route, they meet Napoleon, in exile on Saint Helena, who makes Sharpe an unwitting accomplice to his escape plot. Sharpe becomes entangled in Lord Cochrane&#x27;s risky schemes on behalf of the rebels in the Chilean War of Independence. In the end, he finds Blas Vivar alive, and Napoleon dies before he can escape.

==Equipment==
During the earliest (chronological) books Sharpe is a private and later sergeant, and so his uniform and weapons largely are in line with Army regulations. His first sword was a 1796 light cavalry sabre which with officer&#x27;s sash are taken from the dead in the wake of the Battle of Assaye.

By the time of &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Prey&quot; as a junior rifle officer, although still carrying a regulation Pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre, Sharpe has begun carrying a Baker rifle as well, and is noted to prefer a heavier sword like the cutlass used by the Navy, as the point of the curved sabre was never where he expected it to be and also lacked the weight to block attacks from a musket and bayonet in close-quarter battles.

In &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Rifles&quot;, Sharpe acquires his other signature weapon. Captain Murray, mortally wounded in the Corunna retreat, leaves his Pattern 1796 heavy cavalry sword to him, a replacement for the sword that broke in the battle. From a French chasseur Harper kills, Sharpe takes his overalls and boots. Sharpe continues to wear his green jacket even whilst serving in a regular infantry battalion out of pride, as do Harper and all of the other elite riflemen. As Sharpe, like the majority of his men, also acquires a French ox-hide pack in place of the inferior British one he is originally issued, more of his equipment is French than British.

In &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Assassin&quot;, immediately after the Battle of Waterloo, Sharpe buries his rifle with rifleman Daniel Hagman and takes Hagman&#x27;s (a better weapon) as his own. He is later bestowed the Order of Saint Vladimir (2nd class), which was given to Wellington by Emperor Alexander I of Russia. It was first offered to a cavalry colonel who turned it down, so Wellington gives it to Sharpe.

==Relationships and family==
Sharpe, the son of a prostitute, has almost no memory of his mother, and no knowledge of his father. The author, Bernard Cornwell, in answer to a query on his website, wrote a riddle which he claims contains the father&#x27;s identity: &quot;Take you out, put me in and a horse appears in this happy person!&quot;. Bernard later announced on his website that Sharpe&#x27;s father was a French smuggler, and that is all he &quot;knows&quot;.

Sharpe is both a romantic and a womanizer. In &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Rifles&quot;, Harper notes that &quot;He&#x27;ll fall in love with anything in a petticoat. I&#x27;ve seen his type before. Got the sense of a half-witted sheep when it comes to women.&quot;

In India, Sharpe asks for permission to marry Mary Bickerstaff, who later leaves him (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Tiger&quot;); he also has a brief affair with Frenchwoman Simone Joubert, who bolts for a new life in America with gems he left with her for safekeeping (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Triumph&quot;, &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Fortress&quot;).

His relationship with Lady Grace Hale in 1805 has a more lasting impact; the death of his first child, who succumbs only a few hours after Grace dies in childbirth, leaves Sharpe deeply distressed. In Copenhagen, Sharpe falls in love with Astrid Skovgaard, the daughter of an important Danish spy for the British. However, after the British naval attack on Copenhagen, her father refuses to let her marry him. After Sharpe leaves, she and her father are murdered by British spymaster Lord Pumphrey (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Trafalgar&quot;, &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Prey&quot;), as they know too much and their loyalty has become suspect.

During the early years of the Peninsula Campaign, Sharpe&#x27;s affections are torn between a Portuguese courtesan, Josefina LaCosta, and the Spanish partisan leader Teresa Moreno (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Eagle&quot;, &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Gold&quot;). Teresa bears Sharpe a daughter, Antonia (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Company&quot;), in 1811, and marries Sharpe in 1812, but is murdered a year later by Sharpe&#x27;s longtime enemy, deserter Obadiah Hakeswill (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Enemy&quot;). Sharpe leaves his daughter to be raised by Teresa&#x27;s family, and, as far as is known, never sees her again. Over the same period, Sharpe also has affairs with an English governess, Sarah Fry (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Escape&quot;); Caterina Veronica Blazquez, a prostitute who has beguiled Henry Wellesley, Sir Arthur&#x27;s brother (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Fury&quot;); and the French spy Hélène Leroux (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Sword&quot;, &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Honour&quot;).

For some years, Sharpe carries a small portrait of Jane Gibbons, taken after murdering her treacherous brother (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Eagle&quot;). In 1813, he returns to England to fetch replacements, and meets, elopes with, and marries Jane (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Regiment&quot;). Sharpe remains faithful to his second wife, but after he is falsely accused of theft and murder, she embarks on an adulterous affair with his former friend Lord John Rossendale and steals the fortune Sharpe had entrusted to her. It is while searching for evidence to clear his name that Sharpe meets and falls in love with Lucille Castineau (nee Lassan), the widow of a French officer killed in Russia (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Waterloo&quot;).

Although unable to marry Lucille while Jane lives, Sharpe settles down with her on her family estate in Normandy. They have two children, Patrick-Henri, who becomes a French cavalry officer (and a character in Bernand Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;The Starbuck Chronicles&quot;), and Dominique, who ultimately marries an English aristocrat. By 1861, Patrick-Henri, then a colonel in the Imperial Guard Cavalry observing the Union and Confederate armies during the American Civil War, mentions that his mother is &quot;very lonely&quot;, so it may be assumed that Sharpe has died sometime before that date. (The &quot;Sharpe Companion&quot; gives Sharpe&#x27;s year of death as 1860, though this is never stated in any of the books.) This is contradicted in the television adaptation &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Challenge&quot;, set in 1817, in which Sharpe states that Lucille has already died.

==Historical achievements==
Sharpe is often portrayed as the driving force in a number of pivotal historical events. Cornwell admits to taking license with history, placing Sharpe in the place of another man whose identity is lost to history or sometimes &quot;stealing another man&#x27;s thunder.&quot; Such accomplishments include:

* Disabling a booby trap laid for the British soldiers assaulting Seringapatam (Cornwell points out in the novel&#x27;s historical note that there never actually was such a booby trap, and the event was based on a British shell that struck a magazine in the city days earlier);
* Killing Tipu Sultan and looting his corpse (the identity of the man who killed the sultan is unknown; like Sharpe, the soldier probably wished to remain anonymous because of the riches he acquired);
* Saving Arthur Wellesley&#x27;s life at the Battle of Assaye (Wellesley was unhorsed and forced to defend himself from Maratha artillerymen for a few crucial moments; Cornwell notes that if any soldier or officer had saved his life during this fight, he would almost certainly have rewarded him with a promotion);
* Storming the walls of the inner fortress at Gawilghur and opening the gates to the besieging forces (in reality, this was achieved by Captain Campbell leading the light company of the 94th Scotch Brigade; in the novel, Campbell and his troops are the first to join Sharpe once they realise what he&#x27;s planning);
* Preventing the Danish fleet from being set on fire during the Second battle of Copenhagen (while the order to set the fleet on fire was given, it is unknown why it was never carried out);
* Finding the boats that allowed Wellesley&#x27;s forces to ambush Marshal Nicolas Soult&#x27;s forces at the Second Battle of Porto (Cornwell notes that in reality a Portuguese barber approached the British forces of his own volition rather than being sent across by Sharpe);
* Being the first British soldier to capture an Imperial Eagle, at the Battle of Talavera (in reality, the first French Eagle captured by the British was by Ensign Edward Keogh and Sergeant Patrick Masterson at the Battle of Barrossa in 1811);
* Successfully assaulting the central breach at Badajoz (according to Cornwell&#x27;s historical note, the central breach remained largely unused during the assault);
* Destroying the Army of Deserters and taking their leader &quot;Marshal Pot-au-Feu&quot; Deron captive (Cornwell notes that the historic Deserters&#x27; Army was finally destroyed by the French, though they did hand British deserters over, as shown in the novel);
* Deliberately triggering the massive explosion that destroyed the fortress of Almeida (usually attributed to accident, combined with careless British handling of their munitions store);
* Retrieving and restoring the Imperial Family&#x27;s treasure (in his note, Cornwell notes that several chests of personal belongings and riches did get lost in the chaos of the French defeat of 1814, but how this happened and their final fate are unknown)
* Carrying the news of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Belgium to Wellington at the Duchess of Richmond&#x27;s ball, during the Waterloo campaign (historically the bearer of the message was one of the Prince of Orange&#x27;s ADCs: Lieutenant Henry Webster, 9th Light Dragoons);
* Firing the shot that wounded the Prince of Orange during the Battle of Waterloo, forcing him to retire from the field (in reality, this shot was most likely fired by a French skirmisher);
* Taking command of a regiment in driving off the advance of the French Imperial Guard at the Battle of Waterloo (the regiments who actually held off the Imperial Guard are in the novel as well);
* Saving the Duke of Wellington from two assassination attempts in Paris (Cornwell explains that the first attempt happened, though the shooter simply missed, while the second is fictional and based on a likely deliberate fire that broke out in a house Wellington had been in days earlier).

==Novels, short stories, and non-fiction==
Bernard Cornwell has written 24 novels and three short stories starring Richard Sharpe. The first book &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Eagle&quot; was written in 1981, with Sharpe in Spain at the Talavera Campaign in 1809. The next seven books were written in order, up to &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Siege&quot; in 1814. The novel &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Rifles&quot; was written next, set earlier in 1809 at the time of the retreat from Corunna, Spain. The next four books follow on from &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Siege&quot; up to &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Devil&quot; (1992), set in 1820–21. This twelfth book completes Sharpe&#x27;s timeline.

Following the success of the TV series starting in 1993, Cornwell returned to Sharpe to write &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Battle&quot; (1995), which is set between &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Gold&quot; and &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Company&quot;, which takes place in 1811. Cornwell then moved to the beginning of Sharpe&#x27;s army career in British India, 1799, with &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Tiger&quot; (1997). This began a series of five prequel books, closing with &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Prey&quot; (2003) which depicts the Siege of Copenhagen in 1807. 

Between 2003 and 2007, Cornwell wrote three novels set between &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Rifles&quot; and &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Battle&quot;. He returned to the series in 2021 and has written three additional novels, set between &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Company&quot; and &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Devil&quot;.

Cornwell published the non-fiction book &quot;&quot; in September 2014, timely for the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.

Sharpe possibly appears in Simon Scarrow&#x27;s &quot;The Fields of Death&quot;, although his surname is not confirmed. A major in the 95th Rifles called Richard and who, &quot;unusually for an officer ... carries a rifle like his men&quot;, delivers captured French orders to the Duke of Wellington indicating the enemy&#x27;s intention to fall back to Vitoria.

<text>Shōhei Ōoka (; March 6, 1909 – December 25, 1988) was a Japanese novelist, literary critic, and lecturer and translator of French literature who was active during the Shōwa period. Ōoka belongs to the group of postwar writers whose Pacific War experiences at home and abroad figure prominently in their works. Over his lifetime, he contributed short stories and critical essays to almost every literary magazine in Japan.

==Early life==
Ōoka was born in the ward of Ushigome in Tokyo (now part of Shinjuku) to parents from Wakayama Prefecture. His father was a stockbroker and his mother was a geisha. Raised to study literature from early childhood, he mastered French while in high school. His parents also hired the famed literary critic Kobayashi Hideo to be his tutor. Under Kobayashi&#x27;s instruction, he made the acquaintance of poet Nakahara Chūya, the critic , and others who would become well known literary figures. He entered Kyoto Imperial University School of Literature in April 1929, graduating in March 1932.

After graduation, he became a journalist with the &quot;,&quot; a pro-government newspaper, but quit after one year to devote himself to the study and translation of the works of Stendhal and other European writers into Japanese. In 1938, to support himself, he found a job as a translator with Air Liquide (Teikoku Sansō), a Franco-Japanese industrial company based in Kobe. In June 1943, he left their employ, and in November of the same year obtained a position at Kawasaki Heavy Industries.

However, in 1944, he was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army, given only three months of rudimentary training and sent to the front line at Mindoro Island in the Philippines, where he served as his battalion&#x27;s communications technician until his battalion was routed and numerous men killed. In January 1945, he was captured by American forces and sent to a prisoner of war camp on Leyte Island. Survival was very traumatic for Ōoka, who was troubled that he, a middle-aged and, to his way of thinking, unworthy soldier, had survived when so many others had not. He returned to Japan at the end of the year and lived at Akashi, Hyōgo.

==Literary career==
It was not until his repatriation after the war&#x27;s end that Ōoka began his career as a writer. On the recommendation of his childhood French tutor and mentor Kobayashi Hideo, he published an autobiographical short-story of his experiences as a prisoner of war entitled , published in English as &quot;Taken Captive: A Japanese POW&#x27;s Story&quot;, in three separate parts between 1948 and 1951. Its publication, along with winning the Yokomitsu Riichi Prize in 1949, encouraged him to take up writing as a career.

His next work, &quot;Musashino Fujin&quot;, (, &quot;A Wife in Musashino&quot;, 1950), is a psychological novel patterned after the works of Stendhal.

His best-known novel, &quot;Nobi&quot; (, &quot;Fires on the Plain&quot;, 1951), was also well received by critics, and won the prestigious Yomiuri Prize in 1951. Considered one of the most important novels of the postwar period and based loosely on his own wartime experiences in the Philippines, &quot;Nobi&quot; explores the meaning of human existence through the struggle for survival of men who are driven by starvation to cannibalism. It was subsequently made into a prize-winning film by Ichikawa Kon in 1959, although the film substantially changes the protagonist&#x27;s relationship to the theme of cannibalism and Christianity.

In 1958, he veered from his usual subjects and produced &quot;Kaei&quot; (, &quot;The Shade of Blossoms&quot;, 1958–1959), depicting an aging, naive nightclub hostess’s struggle and ultimate demise from the destructive forces of desire and wealth in the decadent 1950s Ginza. The setting had changed but the recurring themes had not. His characters were still adrift and struggling for survival in an inhospitable environment. &quot;Kaei&quot; won the in 1961.

From 1953 to 1954, he was a Fulbright Visiting Professor at Yale University. He was also a lecturer on French literature at Meiji University in Tokyo.

In the late 1960s, he revisited the subject of the Pacific War and the Japanese defeat in the Philippines to produce the detailed historical novel &quot;Reite senki&quot; (, &quot;A Record of the Battle of Leyte&quot;, 1971). He compiled and researched an enormous amount of information for three years in order to produce it. As with all his writing, it looks at war critically from the perspective of a person who, despite ethical reservations, was forced to serve. The novel won the .

He was invited to become a member of the Japan Art Academy in November 1971 but declined to join, partly, he said, on account of his former experience of soldier and prisoner of war. 

Along with translations and fiction, he also devoted himself to writing the critical biographies of and Nakahara Chūya, which won the Noma Literary Prize in 1974. He was awarded the prestigious Asahi Prize in January 1976 and the Mystery Writers of Japan Award in March 1978.

He died in 1988 at the age of 79. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in the outskirts of Tokyo. He was posthumously awarded a second Yomiuri Prize in 1989 for a biography of Natsume Sōseki.

In October 1994, the Japanese writer Kenzaburō Ōe, when awarded the Nobel Prize of literature, mentioned Shohei Ōoka as one of the Japanese writers who &quot;created the way to the Nobel Prize&quot; for him

<doc id="445718" wikidata="Q1508721" url="?curid=445718" title="Referential integrity">
<text>Referential integrity is a property of data stating that all its references are valid. In the context of relational databases, it requires that if a value of one attribute (column) of a relation (table) references a value of another attribute (either in the same or a different relation), then the referenced value must exist.

For referential integrity to hold in a relational database, any column in a base table that is declared a foreign key can only contain either null values or values from a parent table&#x27;s primary key or a candidate key. In other words, when a foreign key value is used it must reference a valid, existing primary key in the parent table. For instance, deleting a record that contains a value referred to by a foreign key in another table would break referential integrity. Some relational database management systems (RDBMS) can enforce referential integrity, normally either by deleting the foreign key rows as well to maintain integrity, or by returning an error and not performing the delete. Which method is used may be determined by a referential integrity constraint defined in a data dictionary.

The adjective &#x27;referential&#x27; describes the action that a foreign key performs, &#x27;referring&#x27; to a linked column in another table. In simple terms, &#x27;referential integrity&#x27; guarantees that the target &#x27;referred&#x27; to will be found. A lack of referential integrity in a database can lead relational databases to return incomplete data, usually with no indication of an error.

==Formalization==
An inclusion dependency over two (possibly identical) predicates formula_1 and formula_2 from a schema is written formula_3, where the formula_4, formula_5 are distinct attributes (column names) of formula_1 and formula_2. It implies that the tuples of values appearing in columns formula_8 for facts of formula_1 must also appear as a tuple of values in columns formula_10 for some fact of formula_2.

Such constraint is a particular form of tuple-generating dependency (TGD) where in both the sides of the rule there is only one relational atom. In first-order logic it is expressible as formula_12, where formula_13 is the vector (whose size is formula_14) of variables shared by formula_1 and formula_2, and no variable appears multiple times neither in the TGD&#x27;s body nor in its head.

Logical implication between inclusion dependencies can be axiomatized by inference rules
and can be decided by a PSPACE algorithm. The problem can be shown to be PSPACE-complete by reduction from the acceptance problem for a linear bounded automaton. However, logical implication between dependencies that can be inclusion dependencies or functional dependencies is undecidable by reduction from the word problem for monoids.

==Declarative referential integrity==
Declarative referential integrity (DRI) is one of the techniques in the SQL database programming language to ensure data integrity.

===Meaning in SQL=== 

A table (called the referencing table) can refer to a column (or a group of columns) in another table (the referenced table) by using a foreign key. The referenced column(s) in the referenced table must be under a unique constraint, such as a primary key. Also, self-references are possible (not fully implemented in MS SQL Server though). On inserting a new row into the referencing table, the relational database management system (RDBMS) checks if the entered key value exists in the referenced table. If not, no insert is possible. It is also possible to specify DRI actions on UPDATE and DELETE, such as CASCADE (forwards a change/delete in the referenced table to the referencing tables), NO ACTION (if the specific row is referenced, changing the key is not allowed) or SET NULL / SET DEFAULT (a changed/deleted key in the referenced table results in setting the referencing values to NULL or to the DEFAULT value if one is specified).

===Product-specific meaning===
In Microsoft SQL Server the term DRI also applies to the assigning of permissions to users on a database object. Giving DRI permission to a database user allows them to add foreign key constraints on a table.

<doc id="445719" wikidata="Q1277373" url="?curid=445719" title="Earl of Northesk">
<text>Earl of Northesk is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1662 for John Carnegie, who notably served as Sheriff of Forfarshire. He was given the subsidiary title of Lord Rosehill and Eglismauldie (or Inglismaldie) at the same time. Carnegie had already been created Earl of Ethie and Lord Lour in 1647 but relinquished those titles in exchange for the 1662 creations. For the purposes of precedence and seniority, the earldom of Northesk is treated as having been created in 1647, the date of the creation of the earldom of Ethie.

Lord Northesk&#x27;s great-grandson, the fourth Earl, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1708 to 1715. His younger son, the sixth Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. He was succeeded by his son, the seventh Earl. He was also an admiral in the navy and was third in command at the Battle of Trafalgar. Lord Northesk was also a Scottish representative peer between 1796 and 1807 and 1830 and 1831. His grandson, the ninth Earl, was a Scottish representative peer from 1885 to 1891. He was succeeded by his son, the tenth Earl, who served as a Scottish representative peer from 1900 to 1921. His son, the eleventh Earl, was a Scottish representative peer from 1959 to 1963, when all Scottish peers were given an automatic seat in the House of Lords.

The eleventh Earl was succeeded by his first cousin, the twelfth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Douglas Carnegie, second son of the ninth Earl. The fourteenth Earl was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that were allowed to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sat on the Conservative benches. When he died without surviving male issue in 2010, the line of the third Earl failed, and the titles passed to his eighth cousin once removed, the fifteenth Earl, who is a writer and a descendant of the second Earl.

David Carnegie, 1st Earl of Southesk, was the elder brother of the first Earl. Another member of the Carnegie/Carnegy family was Elizabeth Carnegy, Baroness Carnegy of Lour. She was a descendant of the Hon. Patrick Carnegie of Lour, third son of the second Earl of Northesk, and a great-great-granddaughter of Major-General Alexander Carnegie (1793–1862) through his first son, making her a third cousin of the fifteenth Earl.

The earldom is named after the River North Esk in Angus. The family seat was Ethie Castle, near Arbroath, Scotland.
