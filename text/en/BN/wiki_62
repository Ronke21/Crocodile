<text>Card counting is a blackjack strategy used to determine whether the player or the dealer has an advantage on the next hand. Card counters try to overcome the casino house edge by keeping a running count of high and low valued cards dealt. They generally bet more when they have an advantage and less when the dealer has an advantage. They also change playing decisions based on the composition of the deck and sometimes play in teams.

== Basics ==
Card counting is based on statistical evidence that high cards (aces, 10s, and 9s) benefit the player, while low cards, (2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, and 7s) benefit the dealer. High cards benefit the player in the following ways:

# They increase the player&#x27;s probability of hitting a Blackjack, which often pays out at 3 to 2 odds (although some casinos pay at 6 to 5).
# Doubling down increases expected value. The elevated ratio of tens and aces improves the probability that doubling down will succeed. The most common hand values that the player doubles down on are 11, 10, and 9; and drawing a high card to these will make a strong hand.
# They provide additional splitting opportunities for the player.
# They can make the insurance bet profitable by increasing the probability of dealer blackjack.
# They also increase the probability the dealer will bust, in the event that the dealer shows a low up-card (i.e. 2-6). This also increases the odds of the player busting, but the player can choose to stand on lower totals based on the count.

On the other hand, low cards benefit the dealer. The rules require the dealer to hit stiff hands (12–16 total), and low cards are less likely to bust these totals. A dealer holding a stiff hand will bust if the next card is a 10.

Card counters do not need unusual mental abilities; they do not track or memorize specific cards. Instead, card counters assign a point score to each card that estimates the value of that card. They track the sum of these values with a running count. The myth that counters track every card was portrayed in the 1988 film &quot;Rain Man&quot;, in which the savant character Raymond Babbitt counts through six decks with ease, and a casino employee comments that it is impossible to do so.

=== Systems ===
Basic card counting systems assign a positive, negative, or zero value to each card. When a card is dealt, the count is adjusted by that card&#x27;s counting value. Low cards increase the count; they increase the percentage of high cards in the deck. High cards decrease the count for the opposite reason. For example, the Hi-Lo system subtracts one for each 10, jack, queen, king, or ace and adds one for any card between 2 and 6. 7s, 8s, and 9s count as zero and do not affect the count.

A card counting system aims to assign point values roughly correlating to a card&#x27;s &quot;effect of removal&quot; (EOR). The EOR is the estimated effect of removing a given card from play. Counters gauge the effect of removal for all cards dealt and how that affects the current house edge. Larger ratios between point values create better correlations to actual EOR, increasing the efficiency of a system. Such systems are classified as level 1, level 2, level 3, and so on. The level corresponds to the ratio between values.

The Hi-Lo system is a &quot;level-1&quot; count; the running count never increases or decreases by more than one. A &quot;multilevel&quot; count, such as Zen Count, Wong Halves, or Hi-Opt II, further distinguishes card values to increase accuracy. An advanced count includes values such as +2 and −2, or +0.5 and -0.5. Advanced players might also keep a &quot;side count&quot; of specific cards like aces. This is done where betting accuracy differs from playing accuracy.

Many side count techniques exist, including special-purpose counts used for games with nonstandard profitable-play options such as an over/under side bet.

Keeping track of more data with higher level counts can hurt speed and accuracy. Some counters earn more money playing a simple count quickly than by playing a complex count slowly.

This table illustrates some example counting systems.
=== Design and selection of systems ===
The primary goal of a card counting system is to assign point values to each card that roughly correlate to the card&#x27;s &quot;effect of removal&quot; or EOR (that is, the effect a single card has on the house advantage once removed from play), thus enabling the player to gauge the house advantage based on the composition of cards still to be dealt. Larger ratios between point values can better correlate to actual EOR, but add complexity to the system. Counting systems may be referred to as &quot;level 1&quot;, &quot;level 2&quot;, etc., corresponding to the number of different point values the system calls for.

The ideal system is a system that is usable by the player and offers the highest average dollar return per period of time when dealt at a fixed rate. With this in mind, systems aim to achieve a balance of efficiency in three categories:

; Betting correlation (BC)
: When the sum of all the permutations of the undealt cards offers a positive expectation to a player using optimal playing strategy, there is a positive expectation to a player placing a bet. A system&#x27;s BC gauges how effective a system is at informing the user of this situation.
; Playing efficiency (PE)
: A portion of the expected profit comes from modifying playing strategy based on the known altered composition of cards. For this reason, a system&#x27;s PE gauges how effectively it informs the player to modify strategy according to the actual composition of undealt cards. A system&#x27;s PE is important when the effect of PE has a large impact on the total gain, as in single- and double-deck games.
; Insurance correlation (IC)
: A portion of expected gain from counting cards comes from taking the insurance bet, which becomes profitable at high counts. An increase in IC will offer additional value to a card counting system.

Some strategies count the ace (ace-reckoned strategies) and some do not (ace-neutral strategies). Including aces in the count improves betting correlation since the ace is the most valuable card in the deck for betting purposes. However, since the ace can either be counted as one or eleven, including an ace in the count decreases the accuracy of playing efficiency. Since PE is more important in single- and double-deck games, and BC is more important in shoe games, counting the ace is more important in shoe games.

One way to deal with such tradeoffs is to ignore the ace to yield higher PE while keeping a side count which is used to detect an additional change in EV which the player will use to detect additional betting opportunities that ordinarily would not be indicated by the primary card counting system.

The most common side counted card is the ace since it is the most important card in terms of achieving a balance of BC and PE. In theory, a player could keep a side count of every card and achieve a near 100% PE, however, methods involving additional side counts for PE become more complex at an exponential rate as you add more side counts and the ability of the human mind is quickly overtasked and unable to make the necessary computations. Without any side counts, PE can approach 70%.

Since there is the potential to create an overtaxing demand on the human mind while using a card counting system another important design consideration is the ease of use. Higher-level systems and systems with side counts will obviously become more difficult and in an attempt to make them easier, unbalanced systems eliminate the need for a player to keep tabs on the number of cards/decks that have already entered play typically at the expense of lowering PE.

== Running counts versus true counts in balanced counting systems ==
The running count is the running total of each card&#x27;s assigned value. When using a balanced count (such as the Hi-Lo system), the running count is converted into a &quot;true count&quot;, which takes into consideration the number of decks used. With Hi-Lo, the true count is the running count divided by the number of decks that have not yet been dealt; this can be calculated by division or approximated with an average card count per round times the number of rounds dealt. However, many variations of the true count calculation exist.

== Back-counting ==

Back-counting, or &quot;Wonging&quot;, consists of standing behind a blackjack table and counting the cards as they are dealt. Stanford Wong first proposed the idea of back-counting, hence the name.

The player will enter or &quot;Wong in&quot; to the game when the count reaches a point at which the player has an advantage. The player may then raise their bets as their advantage increases, or lower their bets as their advantage goes down. Some back-counters prefer to flat-bet, and only bet the same amount once they have entered the game. Some players will stay at the table until the game is shuffled, or they may &quot;Wong out&quot; or leave when the count reaches a level at which they no longer have an advantage.

Back-counting is generally done on shoe games, of 4, 6, or 8 decks, although it can be done on pitch games of 1 or 2 decks. The reason for this is that the count is more stable in a shoe game, so a player will be less likely to sit down for one or two hands and then have to get up. In addition, many casinos do not allow &quot;mid-shoe entry&quot; in single or double deck games which makes Wonging impossible. Another reason is that many casinos exhibit more effort to thwart card counters on their pitch games than on their shoe games, as a counter has a smaller advantage on an average shoe game than in a pitch game.

=== Advantages ===
Back-counting differs from traditional card-counting in that the player does not play every hand they see. This offers several advantages. For one, the player does not play hands without a statistical advantage. This increases the total advantage of the player. Another advantage is that the player does not have to change their bet size as much (or at all). Large variations in bet size are one way that casinos detect card counters.

=== Disadvantages ===
Back-counting has disadvantages, too. One is that the player frequently does not stay at the table long enough to earn comps. Another disadvantage is that some players may become irritated with players who enter in the middle of a game. They believe that this interrupts the &quot;flow&quot; of the cards. Their resentment may not merely be superstition, though, as this practice will negatively impact the other players at the table; with one fewer player at the table when the card composition becomes unfavorable, the other players will play through more hands under those conditions as they will use up fewer cards per hand. Similarly, they will play fewer hands in the rest of the shoe if the advantage player slips in during the middle of the shoe, when the cards become favorable; with one more player, more of those favorable cards will be used up per hand. This negatively impacts the other players whether they are counting cards or not. Also, a player who hops in and out of games may attract unwanted attention from casino personnel and may be detected as a card-counter.

=== Group counting ===
While a single player can maintain their own advantage with back-counting, card counting is most often used by teams of players to maximize their advantage. In such a team, some players called &quot;spotters&quot; will sit at a table and play the game at the table minimum, while keeping a count (basically doing the back &quot;counting&quot;). When the count is significantly high, the spotter will discreetly signal another player, known as a &quot;big player&quot;, that the count is high (the table is &quot;hot&quot;). The big player will then &quot;Wong in&quot; and wager vastly higher sums (up to the table maximum) while the count is high. When the count &quot;cools off&quot; or the shoe is shuffled (resetting the count), the big player will &quot;Wong out&quot; and look for other counters who are signaling a high count. This was the system used by the MIT Blackjack Team, whose story was in turn the inspiration for the Canadian movie &quot;The Last Casino&quot; which was later re-made into the Hollywood version &quot;21&quot;.

The main advantage of group play is that the team can count several tables while a single back-counting player can usually only track one table. This allows big players to move from table to table, maintaining the high-count advantage without being out of action very long. It also allows redundancy while the big player is seated as both the counter and big player can keep the count (as in the movie &quot;21&quot;, the spotter can communicate the count to the big player discreetly as they sit down). The disadvantages include requiring multiple spotters who can keep an accurate count, splitting the &quot;take&quot; among all members of the team, requiring spotters to play a table regardless of the count (using only basic strategy, these players will lose money long-term), and requiring signals, which can alert pit bosses.

A simple variation removes the loss of having spotters play; the spotters simply watch the table instead of playing and signal big players to Wong in and out as normal. The disadvantages of this variation are reduced ability of the spotter and big player to communicate, reduced comps as the spotters are not sitting down, and vastly increased suspicion, as blackjack is not generally considered a spectator sport in casinos except among those actually playing (unlike craps, roulette, and wheels of fortune which have larger displays and so tend to attract more spectators).

== Ranging bet sizes and the Kelly criterion ==
A mathematical principle called the Kelly criterion indicates that bet increases should be proportional to the player&#x27;s advantage. In practice, this means that the higher the count, the more a player should bet to take advantage of the player&#x27;s edge. Using this principle, a counter can vary bet sizes in proportion to the advantage dictated by a count. This creates a &quot;bet ramp&quot; according to the principles of the Kelly criterion. A bet ramp is a betting plan with a specific bet size tied to each true count value in such a way that the player wagers proportionally to the player&#x27;s advantage to maximize bankroll growth. Taken to its conclusion, the Kelly criterion demands that a player not bet anything when the deck does not offer a positive expectation; &quot;Wonging&quot; implements this.

== Expected profit ==
Historically, blackjack played with a perfect basic strategy offered a house edge of less than 0.5%. As more casinos have switched games to dealer hits soft-17 and blackjack pays 6:5, the average house edge in Nevada has increased to 1%. A typical card counter who ranges bets appropriately in a game with six decks will have an advantage of approximately 1% over the casino. Advantages of up to 2.5% are possible at normal penetrations from counting 6-deck Spanish 21, for the S17 or H17 with redoubling games. This amount varies based on the counter&#x27;s skill level, penetration (1 – a fraction of pack cut off), and the betting spread (player&#x27;s maximum bet divided by minimum bet). The variance in blackjack is high, so generating a sizable profit can take hundreds of hours of play. The deck will only have a positive enough count for the player to raise bets 10%-35% of the time depending on rules, penetration, and strategy.

At a table where a player makes a $100 average bet, a 1% advantage means a player will win an average of $1 per round. This translates into an average hourly winning of $50 if the player is dealt 50 hands per hour.

Under one set of circumstances, a player with a 1-15 unit bet spread with only one-deck cut off of a six-deck game will enjoy an advantage of as much as 1.2% with a Standard Deviation of 3.5 on a 2.1 unit average bet. Therefore, it is highly advisable for counters to set aside a large dedicated bankroll; one popular rule of thumb dictates a bankroll of 100 times the maximum bet per hand.

Another aspect of the probability of card counting is that, at higher counts, the player&#x27;s probability of winning a hand is only slightly changed and still below 50%. The player&#x27;s edge over the house on such hands does not come from the player&#x27;s probability of winning the hands. Instead, it comes from the increased probability of blackjacks, increased gain and benefits from doubling, splitting, and surrender, and the insurance side bet, which becomes profitable at high counts.

Many factors affect expected profit, including:
* The overall efficiency of a card counting system at detecting player advantage; affects how often the player will actually play a hand at an advantage per period of time
* The overall efficiency at creating player advantage as a whole; a system may indicate a small advantage when in fact the advantage is much larger – this reduces the overall ROI of the system while in play.
* The rules of the game.
* Penetration will almost directly affect the magnitude of player advantage that is exploitable and the rate that hands are dealt with a player at an advantage.
* The number of players seated at a table will slow the game pace, and reduce the number of hands a player will be able to play in a given time frame.
* Game speed, table with side bets will be dealt at a slower pace than tables without them which will reduce the number of hands dealt over time.
* The use of an automatic shuffle machine or in rare cases, a dealer dedicated solely to shuffling a new shoe while another is in play, will eliminate the need for the dealer to shuffle the shoe prior to dealing a new one, increasing game speed.

== Legal status ==
Card counting is not illegal under British law, nor is it under federal, state, or local laws in the United States provided that no external card counting device or person assists the player in counting cards. Still, casinos object to the practice, and try to prevent it, banning players believed to be counters. In their pursuit to identify card counters, casinos sometimes misidentify and ban players suspected of counting cards even if they do not.

Atlantic City casinos in the US state of New Jersey are forbidden from banning card counters as a result of a New Jersey Supreme Court decision. In 1979, Ken Uston, a Blackjack Hall of Fame inductee, filed a lawsuit against an Atlantic City casino, claiming that casinos did not have the right to ban skilled players. The New Jersey Supreme Court agreed, ruling that &quot;the state&#x27;s control of Atlantic City&#x27;s casinos is so complete that only the New Jersey Casino Control Commission has the power to make rules to exclude skillful players.&quot; The commission has made no regulation on card counting, so Atlantic City casinos are not allowed to ban card counters. As they are unable to ban counters even when identified, Atlantic City casinos have increased the use of countermeasures.

Macau, the only legal gambling location in China, does not technically prohibit card counting but casinos reserve the right to expel or ban any customers, as is the case in the US and Britain. The use of electronic devices to aid such strategies, however, is strictly prohibited and can lead to arrest.

== Casino reactions ==
=== Detection ===

Monitoring player behavior to assist with detecting the card counters falls into the hands of the on-floor casino personnel (&quot;pit bosses&quot;) and casino-surveillance personnel, who may use video surveillance (&quot;the eye in the sky&quot;) as well as computer analysis, to try to spot playing behavior indicative of card counting. Early counter-strategies featured the dealers learning to count the cards themselves to recognize the patterns in the players. Many casino chains keep databases of players that they consider undesirable. Casinos can also subscribe to databases of advantage players offered by agencies like Griffin Investigations, Biometrica, and OSN (Oregon Surveillance Network). Griffin Investigations filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2005 after losing a libel lawsuit filed by professional gamblers. In 2008 all Chapter 11 payments were said to be up to date and all requirements met, and information was being supplied using data encryption and secure servers. If a player is found to be in such a database, they will almost certainly be stopped from play and asked to leave regardless of their table play. For successful card counters, therefore, skill at &quot;cover&quot; behavior, to hide counting and avoid &quot;drawing heat&quot; and possibly being barred, may be just as important as playing skill.

Detection of card counters will be confirmed after a player is first suspected of counting cards; when seeking card counters, casino employees, whatever their position, could be alerted by many things that are most common when related to card counting but not common for other players. These include:
* Large buy-ins.
* Dramatic bet variation especially with larger bets being placed only at the end of a shoe.
* Playing only a small number of hands during a shoe.
* Refusal to play rated.
* Table hopping.
* Playing multiple hands.
* Lifetime winnings.

Card counters may make unique playing strategy deviations not normally used by non-counters. Plays such as splitting tens, doubling soft 18/19/20, standing on 15/16, and surrendering on 14, when basic strategy says otherwise, may be a sign of a card counter.

Extremely aggressive plays such as splitting tens and doubling soft 19 and 20 are often called out to the pit to notify them because they are telltale signs of not only card counters but hole carding.

=== Technology for detecting card counters ===
Several semi-automated systems have been designed to aid the detection of card counters. The MindPlay system (now discontinued) scanned card values as the cards were dealt. The Shuffle Master Intelligent Shoe system also scans card values as cards exit the shoe. Software called Bloodhound and Protec 21 allows voice input of card and bet values, in an attempt to determine the player edge. A more recent innovation is the use of RFID signatures embedded within the casino chips so that the table can automatically track bet amounts.

Automated card-reading technology has known abuse potential in that it can be used to simplify the practice of &quot;preferential shuffling –&quot; having the dealer reshuffle the cards whenever the odds favor the players. To comply with licensing regulations, some blackjack protection systems have been designed to delay access to real-time data on the remaining cards in the shoe. Other vendors consider real-time notification to surveillance that a shoe is &quot;hot&quot; to be an important product feature.

With card values, play decisions, and bet decisions conveniently accessible, the casino can analyze bet variation, play accuracy, and play variation.

&quot;Bet variation&quot;. The simplest way a card counter makes money is to bet more when they have an edge. While playing back the tapes of a recent session of play, the software can generate a scatter plot of the amount bet versus the count at the time the bet was made and find the trendline that best fits the scattered points. If the player is not counting cards, there will be no trend; their bet variation and the count variation will not consistently correlate. If the player is counting and varying bets according to the count, there will be a trend whose slope reflects the player&#x27;s average edge from this technique.

&quot;Play variation&quot;. When card counters vary from basic strategy, they do so in response to the count, to gain an additional edge. The software can verify whether there is a pattern to play variation. Of particular interest is whether the player sometimes (when the count is positive) takes insurance and stands on 16 versus a dealer 10, but plays differently when the count is negative.

=== Countermeasures ===
Casinos have spent a great amount of effort and money in trying to thwart card counters. Countermeasures used to prevent card counters from profiting at blackjack include:
* Decreasing penetration, the number of cards dealt before a shuffle. This reduces the advantage of card counting.
* Banning known counters from playing blackjack, all games, or entering casino property (trespassing).
* Shuffling when a player increases their wager or when the casino feels the remaining cards are advantageous to the player (preferential shuffling).
* Changing rules for splitting, doubling down, or playing multiple hands. This also includes changing a table&#x27;s stakes.
* Not allowing entry into a game until a shuffle occurs (no mid-shoe entry).
* Flat betting a player or making it so they cannot change the amount they bet during a shoe.
* Canceling comps earned by counters.
* Confiscation of chips.
* Detention (back rooming).

Some jurisdictions (e.g. Nevada) have few legal restrictions placed on these countermeasures. Other jurisdictions such as New Jersey limit the countermeasures a casino can take against skilled players.

Some countermeasures result in disadvantages for the casino. Frequent or complex shuffling, for example, reduces the amount of playing time and consequently the house winnings. Some casinos use automatic shuffling machines to counter the loss of time, with some models of machines shuffling one set of cards while another is in play. Others, known as continuous shuffle machines (CSMs), allow the dealer to simply return used cards to a single shoe to allow playing with no interruption. Because CSMs essentially force minimal penetration, they greatly reduce the advantage of traditional counting techniques. In most online casinos the deck is shuffled at the start of each new round, ensuring the house always has the advantage.

== History ==
American mathematician Edward O. Thorp is the father of card counting. His 1962 book, &quot;Beat the Dealer&quot;, outlines betting and playing strategies for optimal play. Although mathematically sound, some of the techniques no longer apply, as casinos took countermeasures (such as no longer dealing with the last card). The counting system in &quot;Beat the Dealer,&quot; the 10-count, is harder to use and less profitable than later systems. A history of how counting developed can be seen in David Layton&#x27;s documentary film &quot;The Hot Shoe&quot;.

Before &quot;Beat the Dealer&quot;, a small number of professional card counters were beating blackjack games in Vegas and elsewhere. One was Jess Marcum, who developed the first full-fledged point-count system. Another pre-Thorp card counter was professional gambler Joe Bernstein. He is described in 1961&#x27;s &quot;I Want To Quit Winners&quot; by Reno casino owner Harold Smith as an ace counter feared throughout Nevada. And in the 1957 book, &quot;Playing Blackjack to Win&quot;, Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey, Herbert Maisel, and James McDermott (known as &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;) published the first accurate blackjack basic strategy and a rudimentary card counting system, devised solely with the aid of crude mechanical calculators – what used to be called &quot;adding machines&quot;.

From the early days, some have been succeeded, including Al Francesco, the inventor of blackjack team play and the man who taught Ken Uston how to count cards, and Tommy Hyland, manager of the longest-running blackjack team in history. Ken Uston, perhaps the most famous card-counter through his &quot;60 Minutes&quot; television appearance and his books, tended to overstate his winnings, as documented by players who worked with him, including Al Francesco and team member Darryl Purpose.

In the 1970s and 1980s, as computing power grew, more advanced and harder card counting systems came into favor. Many card counters agree, however, that a simpler and less advantageous system that can be played flawlessly for hours earns an overall higher return than a more complex system prone to user error.

=== Teams ===

In the 1970s Ken Uston was the first to write about a tactic of card counting he called the Big Player Team. The book was based on his experiences working as a &quot;big player&quot; (BP) on Al Francesco&#x27;s teams. In big-player blackjack teams a number of card counters, called &quot;spotters&quot;, are dispatched to tables around a casino, where their responsibility is to keep track of the count and signal to the big player when the count indicates a player advantage. The big player then joins the game at that table, placing maximum bets at a player advantage. When the spotter indicates that the count has dropped, they again signal the BP to leave the table. By jumping from table to table as called in by spotters, BP avoids all play at a disadvantage. In addition, since BP&#x27;s play appears random and irrational, they avoid detection by the casinos. The spotters, who are doing the actual counting, are not themselves changing their bet size or strategy, so they are relatively inconspicuous.

With this style of play, a number of blackjack teams have cleared millions of dollars through the years. Well-known blackjack teams with documented earnings in the millions include those run by Al Francesco, Ken Uston, Tommy Hyland, various groups from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and, most recently, a team called &quot;The Greeks&quot;. Ken Uston wrote about blackjack team play in &quot;Million Dollar Blackjack&quot; (), although many of the experiences he represents as his own in his books actually happened to other players, especially Bill Erb, a BP Uston worked with on Al Francesco&#x27;s team. Ben Mezrich also covers team play in his book &quot;Bringing Down The House&quot; (), which describes how MIT students used it with great success. See also the Canadian movie &quot;The Last Casino&quot; and the American movie &quot;21&quot;, which was based on Mezrich&#x27;s book.

The publication of Ken Uston&#x27;s books and of his landmark lawsuits against the casinos, both stimulated the growth of blackjack teams (Hyland&#x27;s team and the first MIT team were formed in Atlantic City shortly after the publication of &quot;Million Dollar Blackjack&quot;) and increased casino awareness of the methods of blackjack teams, making it more difficult for such teams to operate. Hyland and Francesco soon switched to a form of shuffle tracking called &quot;Ace sequencing&quot;. Also referred to as &quot;cutting to the Ace&quot;, this technique involves various methods designed to spot the bottom card during a shuffle (ideally an Ace) and expertly cut the deck and play future hands to force the player to receive the Ace. This made it more difficult for casinos to detect when team members were playing with an advantage. In 1994, members of the Hyland team were arrested for ace sequencing and blackjack team play at Casino Windsor in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It was documented in court that Nevada casinos with ownership stakes in the Windsor casino were instrumental in the decision to prosecute team members on cheating charges. However, the judge ruled that the players&#x27; conduct was not cheating, but merely the use of intelligent strategy.

=== Shuffling machines ===

Automatic shuffling machines (ASMs or batch shufflers), that randomly shuffle decks, interfere with the shuffle tracking variation of card counting by hiding the shuffle. Continuous shuffling machines (CSMs), that partially shuffle used cards back into the &quot;shoe&quot; during play, interfere with card counting. CSMs result in very shallow penetration (number of seen cards), greatly reducing the effectiveness of card counting.

<doc id="438498" wikidata="Q5159974" url="?curid=438498" title="Confessing Movement">
<text>The Confessing Movement is a largely lay-led theologically conservative Christian movement that opposes the influence of theological liberalism and theological progressivism currently within several mainline Protestant denominations and seeks to return those denominations to its view of orthodox doctrine or to form new denominations and disfellowship them if the situation becomes untenable. Those who eventually deem dealing with theological liberalism and theological progressivism within their churches and denominations as not being tenable anymore would later join or start Confessional churches and/or Evangelical churches that continue with the traditions of their respective denominations and maintaining orthodox doctrine while being ecclesiastically separate from the Mainline Protestant denominations. Youth aligned with the Confessing Movement have viewed their project as being an &#x27;Operation Reconquista&#x27;.

It overlaps with other conservative Christian movements including Evangelicalism, and within Methodism specifically, the Holiness movement. Its members have stated their commitment to work to change their home denominations from within rather than establishing new ones, even if they are unable to regain full influence. It also has overlaps with Confessionalism which is identified with the belief in the importance of full and unambiguous assent to the whole of a religious movements&#x27; or denominations&#x27; teachings such as those found in Confessions of Faith which they see as accurate summaries of the teachings found in Scripture and accurately shows their distinction from other groups. Confessionalism is most visible among Lutherans known as Confessional Lutherans. The Confessing Movement places particular weight on the role of evangelism and traditional Bible teachings concerning the deity of Christ and holds conservative, historical Christian views on sexuality, especially homosexuality.

==Confessing Movement in the churches==
A large group of laity and a somewhat smaller group of clergy within the mainline churches hold that their denominations have been &quot;hijacked&quot; by those who, in their view, have &quot;forsaken Christianity&quot; for moral relativism to accommodate democratic pluralist society in America. They reject church leaders such as United Methodist Bishop Joseph Sprague of Chicago and Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong as being apostate.

Although tension between theological modernizers and traditionalists in American Protestantism has existed for generations, the formation of the Confessing Movement was triggered by changing positions on sexual orientation and especially the ordination of &quot;practicing homosexuals&quot; as clergy. Other issues influencing some groups were the ordination of women, and the decline in attendance of many of the mainline denominations from the 1960s to the 1980s in the US, with leaders of the Confessing Movement arguing that the shrinking of mainline church membership resulted from conservative members leaving for growing evangelical churches rather than liberal members disengaging.

==Global==
===Lutheran===

The Communion of Nordic Lutheran Dioceses are non-territorial Lutheran dioceses that entered into schism with their national churches in 2003 due to what they perceived as &quot;the secularization of the national/state churches in their respective countries involving matters of both Christian doctrine and ethics&quot;. These dioceses are members of the International Lutheran Council, a body of Confessional Lutherans; they are in full communion with one another and include the Evangelical Lutheran Mission Diocese of Finland, Mission Province of the Church of Sweden, and the Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of Norway.

Conservative traditions have always been strong in the Lutheran synods of North America. Over the last two centuries, most of the many new synods were started by members who felt their synod was straying from Christian orthodoxy. There are several reform movements that have been founded in recent years to effect change within existing Lutheran denominations. The largest of these organizations is the WordAlone Network, organized in 2000 in opposition to the Concordat/Called to Common Mission agreement with the Episcopal Church USA. Under that agreement, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) agreed to undertake the Episcopal practice of being governed by bishops in the historic episcopate. Many Lutherans saw this as contrary to Lutheran theology and organized in opposition to it. While the WordAlone Network has worked to reform church governance, sometimes with little visible reward for their effort, they succeeded at the 2005 Churchwide Assembly of the ELCA in slowing the efforts of those who sought to revise the understanding of homosexuality within the ELCA. This was accomplished in cooperation with others who did not oppose the historic episcopate through the Solid Rock Lutherans organization. WordAlone has also been an incubator for launching related groups working to reform the church. They include a new publisher of a Lutheran hymnal (Reclaim Lutheran Worship), LC3, and Lutheran CORE. The most successful WordAlone outgrowth is Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ (LCMC), a post-denominational association of 724 congregations in ten countries, with 656 of them in the United States.

The Evangelical Lutheran Confessing Fellowship (ELCF) is one of the more recent of these &quot;reform&quot; movements, inspired by the other Protestant &quot;confessing movements&quot; described in this article. The ELCF was organized in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in February, 2002 by about 60 pastors and laypersons who belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The goal of the movement is to remain faithful to the orthodox or traditional teachings of the church, especially with regard to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, the unique Lordship of Jesus Christ, the authority of scripture, and human sexual intimacy. Its efforts have been to persuade the ELCA to return to orthodox positions with regard to its theology and teachings, rather than separation from the ELCA. According to their initial press release, a primary goal is to head off apparent movement toward formal recognition and ordination of homosexual clergy. In 2005, the proposals to allow ordination of homosexual clergy and blessing of homosexual relationships were defeated at the ELCA&#x27;s national convention.

In 2005 the Lutheran Coalition for Reform (Lutheran CORE) was formed to organize groups and individuals within the ELCA to uphold the traditional church teachings on the scriptures, marriage, and sexuality. The decisions of the 2009 ELCA Churchwide Assembly to allow pastors to be in same-sex relationships and still preach the ministry caused Lutheran CORE to begin working towards focusing on helping alternative confessing fellowships for Lutherans no matter what church affiliations. Lutheran CORE still maintains membership within the ELCA and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada though they also have affiliations with LCMC and the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod, among others; Lutheran CORE was also instrumental in the formation of the North American Lutheran Church in 2010 by Lutheran CORE congregations that no longer wished to be part of the ELCA or ELCiC.

Still working within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is the Society of Orthodox Lutheran Advocates (SOLA), which aims to restore what it sees as theological orthodoxy in the denomination.

===Methodist===
The Confessing Movement within the United Methodist Church quotes Methodism&#x27;s founder, John Wesley: 

Leaders have included Thomas C. Oden, Maxie Dunnam, Bill Hinson, John Ed Mathison, Karen Covey Moore, William J. Abraham, and James Heidinger. The movement was successful in maintaining doctrinal standards and traditional United Methodist positions on theology and practice at the General Conferences in Cleveland (2000), Pittsburgh (2004), and Fort Worth (2008). At the 2008 conference, for instance, delegates voted to retain language in the Social Creed defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman. They also maintained the traditional teaching that although homosexuals &quot;are individuals of sacred worth&quot;, homosexual practice is &quot;incompatible with Christian teaching&quot;. After the 2019 United Methodist General Conference, the denomination became sharply divided over the issue of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. Because of this split, there was speculation about the UMC separating or dividing into two or more denominations. An exit plan for dissatisfied congregations was passed by the 2019 General Conference and upheld by the Judicial Council (top court of the United Methodist Conference). In addition, there are proposals for annual conferences to take place for the purpose of regular doctrinal evaluation.

Other Methodist organizations aligned with the Confessing Movement within the United Methodist Church include the Wesleyan Covenant Association, Concerned Methodists, Good News, UM Action, the Independent Committee on Alcohol and Drugs for United Methodists, Transforming Congregations, the Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality (Lifewatch), and Renew Network. These groups worked together to launch the Global Methodist Church, a traditionalist Methodist denomination, in 2022.

Currently, in The United Methodist Church, a caucus known as Young Methodists for Tradition, works to restore the denomination to what it sees as theological orthodoxy. Associated with the YMFT is Christian apologist Methodist Answers.

Apart from these traditionalist organizations within the United Methodist Church, other theologically traditional Methodist denominations holding views similar to those espoused by the Confessing Movement include the Free Methodist Church, the Missionary Methodist Church, the Primitive Methodist Church, the Holiness Methodist Church, and the Congregational Methodist Church; these churches are all aligned with the Wesleyan-holiness movement. Methodist denominations that have preserved certain distinctives of early Methodism, such as women&#x27;s headcovering and abstaining from wearing jewelry, include the Fellowship of Independent Methodist Churches and the Evangelical Wesleyan Church, respectively. 

As a result of conflict with the United Methodist leadership, the Confessing Movement within the United Methodist Church launched the Global Methodist Church. Other formerly United Methodist congregations aligned with the Confessing Movement within the United Methodist Church chose to join the Free Methodist Church and the Congregational Methodist Church.

===Episcopalian / Anglican ===
Originating at the first Global Anglican Future Conference in 2008, the Global Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (GAFCON) encompasses approximately 40 million Anglicans around the world. It includes Anglican Communion-recognized provinces in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Myanmar, Nigeria, Paraguay, Peru, South Sudan, Uganda, and Uruguay. GAFCON also encompasses as full members provinces in Brazil, Europe, and North America that are not recognized by the Canterbury-aligned structures of the Anglican Communion. GAFCON members also include individual confessing dioceses in Australia, Ghana, and Tanzania, as well as preexisting Anglican breakaway churches such as the Reformed Episcopal Church, the Free Church of England, and REACH-SA, as well as more recent structures such as the Church of Confessing Anglicans Aotearoa/New Zealand and the Diocese of the Southern Cross. 

One forerunner of the Anglican Church in North America was the American Anglican Council, which included members of both the mainline Episcopal Church and the eventual ACNA. The council states: 
Still working within The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America is the Episcopal Fellowship for Renewal, which aims to restore what it sees as theological orthodoxy in the denomination.

==United States==
===Reformed===
====Continental Reformed====
Working within the Reformed Church in America is the Reformed Revivalists in America, which aims to restore what it sees as theological orthodoxy in the denomination.

====Presbyterian====
One of the fastest growing Confessing Movements is within the Presbyterian Church (USA). In February, 2002 more than 800 laity, pastors, deacons, and elders gathered in Atlanta, Georgia for the first National Celebration of Confessing Churches. Participating churches affirm that Christ is the only way of salvation, that the Bible is infallible in its teachings, and that sexual relations are exclusively for marriage.

More than 1,300 of the denomination&#x27;s 11,000 congregations have adopted such declarations and become part of a loosely knit Confessing Church Movement.

The books &quot;Union in Christ: A Declaration for the Church&quot; (1999) and &quot;A Passion for the Gospel: Confessing Jesus Christ for the 21st Century&quot; (2000), both by Mark Achtemeier and Andrew Purves, have served as rallying cries for Confessing Presbyterians.

The positions held by these caucuses is similar to that of denominations such as the Presbyterian Church in America; a more conservative denomination is the Free Presbyterian Church of North America.

Still working within the Presbyterian Church (USA) is Presbyterians for the Kingdom, which aims to restore what it sees as theological orthodoxy in the denomination.

====United Church of Christ====

In the United Church of Christ, a denomination in the Congregationalist tradition, the first confessing movement founded was the Biblical Witness Fellowship, formed in 1977 after a General Synod sexuality study that, to the founders, seemed to take a decidedly permissive attitude toward non-marital sex and homosexuality. The BWF advocates a dual goal of local church renewal and national level reformation. Under the leadership of executive director David Runnion-Bareford, a Candia, New Hampshire, pastor, this movement has presented reformation initiatives before each of the last five Synods of the UCC, including a successful reaffirmation of the Lordship of Jesus Christ and the denomination&#x27;s historic symbol, the &quot;Cross Triumphant,&quot; in 2005. &quot;Focus Renewal Ministries&quot; was founded as a charismatic expression within the United Church of Christ, although its membership is small. More recently, some UCC conservatives began a &quot;Faithful and Welcoming&quot; movement, led by the Rev. Bob Thompson, pastor of Hickory, North Carolina&#x27;s Corinth Reformed UCC. Like the founding of the BWF, that initiative followed the controversial General Synod of 2005 (in which the denomination in effect endorsed the efforts of same-sex couples to marry) and seeks to keep churches from leaving the denomination. Generally speaking, the F&amp;W movement is perceived as less strident than the BWF, which has close relationships with established para-denominational evangelical organizations such as Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Massachusetts.

However, the UCC&#x27;s renewal advocates have been far less successful than their counterparts in other mainline bodies: according to Faithful and Welcoming, over 250 congregations have withdrawn from the denomination since 2005, and despite the work mentioned above, the national leadership, and probably a majority of the remaining congregations, are resolute in their support of liberal theological and social stands. It is thus likely that laypeople and clergy espousing the aims of BWF, FRM, and F&amp;W will remain small minorities in the denomination for the foreseeable future. Given this scenario, many more of the remaining advocates may well defect to more conservative Congregationalist denominations such as the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, leaving the UCC as perhaps the U.S.&#x27;s most politically and theologically liberal Christian group.

===Baptists===
Working within the American Baptist Churches USA is the American Baptists for Christ, which aims to restore what it sees as theological orthodoxy in the denomination.

==Australia==

===Uniting Church in Australia===
The Assembly of Confessing Congregations of the Uniting Church in Australia formed in 2006. It is the result of the coming together of two groups: the Reforming Alliance (est. 2003 in response decision by the UCA&#x27;s 2003 Assembly not ban outright on the ordination of practicing homosexuals,) and the Evangelical Members within the Uniting Church in Australia (EMU) (est. in the early 1990s as a conservative response to what was seen as the church&#x27;s growing liberalism).

Some traditionalist members of the Uniting Church in Australia have left to join conservative denominations, with those who are Wesleyan-Arminian in theology joining the Free Methodist Church and those who are Reformed in theology joining groups such as the Free Presbyterian Church.

<doc id="438505" wikidata="Q1186870" url="?curid=438505" title="Double-byte character set">
<text>A double-byte character set (DBCS) is a character encoding in which either all characters (including control characters) are encoded in two bytes, or merely every graphic character not representable by an accompanying single-byte character set (SBCS) is encoded in two bytes (Han characters would generally comprise most of these two-byte characters). A DBCS supports national languages that contain many unique characters or symbols (the maximum number of characters that can be represented with one byte is 256 characters, while two bytes can represent up to 65,536 characters). Examples of such languages include Japanese and Chinese. Hangul does not contain as many characters, but KS X 1001 supports both Hangul and Hanja, and uses two bytes per character.

==In CJK computing==
The term &quot;DBCS&quot; traditionally refers to a character encoding where each graphic character is encoded in two bytes.

In an 8-bit code, such as Big-5 or Shift JIS, a character from the DBCS is represented with a lead (first) byte with the most significant bit set (i.e., being greater than seven bits), and paired up with a single-byte character-set (SBCS). For the practical reason of maintaining compatibility with unmodified, off-the-shelf software, the SBCS is associated with half-width characters and the DBCS with full-width characters. In a 7-bit code such as ISO-2022-JP, escape sequences or shift codes are used to switch between the SBCS and DBCS.

Sometimes, the use of the term &quot;DBCS&quot; can imply an underlying structure that does not comply with ISO 2022. For example, &quot;DBCS&quot; can sometimes mean a double-byte encoding that is specifically not Extended Unix Code (EUC).

This original meaning of DBCS is different from what some consider correct usage today. Some insist that these character encodings be properly called multi-byte character sets (MBCS) or variable-width encodings, because character encodings such as EUC-JP, EUC-KR, EUC-TW, GB 18030, and UTF-8 use more than two bytes for some characters, and they support one byte for other characters.

==Ambiguity ==
Some people use DBCS to mean the UTF-16 and UTF-8 encodings, while other people use the term DBCS to mean older (pre-Unicode) character encodings that use more than one byte per character. Shift JIS, GB 2312 and Big5 are a few character encodings that can contain more than one byte per character, but even using the term DBCS for these character encodings is incorrect terminology because these character encodings are really variable-width encodings (as are both UTF-16 and UTF-8). Some IBM mainframes do have true DBCS code pages, which contain only the double byte portion of a multi-byte code page.

If a person uses the term &quot;DBCS enablement&quot; for software internationalization, they are using ambiguous terminology. They either mean they want to write software for East Asian markets using older technology with code pages, or they are planning on using Unicode. Sometimes this term also implies translation into an East Asian language. Usually &quot;Unicode enablement&quot; means internationalizing software by using Unicode, and &quot;DBCS enablement&quot; means using incompatible character encodings that exist between the various countries in East Asia for internationalizing software. Since Unicode, unlike many other character encodings, supports all the major languages in East Asia, it is generally easier to enable and maintain software that uses Unicode. DBCS (non-Unicode) enablement is usually only desired when much older operating systems or applications do not support Unicode.

==TBCS==

A triple-byte character set (TBCS) is a character encoding in which characters (including control characters) are encoded in three bytes.

<doc id="438506" wikidata="Q7869535" url="?curid=438506" title="USS G-1">
<text>USS &quot;G-1&quot; (SS-19½) was the lead ship of her class of submarine of the United States Navy. While the four G-boats were nominally all of a class, they differed enough in significant details that they are sometimes considered to be four unique boats, each in a class by herself.

==Construction history==
&quot;G-1&quot; was named &quot;Seal&quot; when her keel was laid down on 2 February 1909 by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Newport News, Virginia, under a subcontract from the Lake Torpedo Boat Company, making her the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the seal, a sea mammal valued for its skin and oil. She was launched on 8 February 1911, sponsored by Miss Margaret V. Lake, daughter of Simon Lake, the submarine pioneer. She was renamed &quot;G-1&quot; on 17 November 1911, and commissioned in the New York Navy Yard on 28 October 1912 with Lieutenant Kenneth Whiting in command.

&quot;Seal&quot; was the first contract the Lake Torpedo Boat Company secured from the United States Government, but the contract&#x27;s requirements were among the most severe ever required of a shipbuilder. The Company did not receive any payment on account during her construction and her required performances had never been approached by any other submarine in the world. &quot;G-1&quot; eventually met those requirements and was commissioned into the Navy, albeit several years late. In addition to a pair of fixed torpedo tubes in the bow, &quot;G-1&quot; carried two torpedo tubes in mounts inside her superstructure that could be trained in the same manner as a deck gun on a surface vessel while the boat was submerged, thus allowing a &quot;broadside&quot; shot of one or more torpedoes.

==Service history==
After fitting out in New York City, &quot;G-1&quot; proceeded to the Naval Torpedo Station, Rhode Island, arriving there on 30 January 1913. Attached to the Atlantic Submarine Flotilla, &quot;G-1&quot; spent the next year and a half conducting dive training and torpedo firing exercises in Long Island Sound and Narragansett Bay. In preparation for her final acceptance trials in October 1913, the boat made a record dive of in Long Island Sound. Financial considerations led to &quot;G-1&quot; being put in reserve at New York City on 15 June 1914.

&quot;G-1&quot; was placed in full commission at New York City on 6 February 1915 with Lieutenant, junior grade Joseph M. Deem in command. In company with sister ship , tender and tug , &quot;G-1&quot; sailed south on 25 March into Chesapeake Bay and down the seaboard for Norfolk, Virginia. Arriving there two days later, she conducted maneuvers in Hampton Roads as part of the Third Division, Submarine Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet. On 2 April, while off Old Point Comfort, &quot;G-1&quot; grazed steam ship &quot;Ocean View&quot;, wrecking the submersible&#x27;s wooden false bow.

After a short period at Norfolk for repairs, the division cruised south to Charleston, South Carolina, mooring there on 17 April. Heavy seas encountered during this coastwise passage caused the two &quot;G&quot;-class submarines to roll heavily, spring oil leaks, and pop engine rivets. Following a three-week yard period in Charleston, the two boats – accompanied by &quot;Fulton&quot; and gunboat – proceeded back to New York City on 6 May, arriving there three days later.

Upon arrival, retired Rear Admiral Yates Stirling Jr., senior aide on the staff of Commander, Submarine Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, inspected the boat and concluded the &quot;G&quot;-boats were crude and inefficient in comparison to current designs. Deeming their military value negligible, he urged that a field of scientific or experimental use be found for them.

===Training ship===
&quot;G-1&quot; departed New York on 23 May 1915 and proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, where she became a school ship on the torpedo range. She also carried out harbor defense and patrol battle problems in Narragansett Bay. Aside from minor repairs at New York in June, this duty continued until 3 October, when she set course – along with tender – for a training cruise to Chesapeake Bay. After making a few days of practice attack runs against the monitor off Fisherman&#x27;s Island, the boat returned to Newport on 12 October for inspection and crew changes; a week later, she shifted to Naval Submarine Base New London, the new submarine base at New London, Connecticut.

On 4 December, while the crew of &quot;G-1&quot; was charging batteries, a circulating pump broke down and severely overheated the port engine. That mishap – combined with a steering gear overhaul at New York – kept ship&#x27;s force busy in the yard for the next thirteen months. While there, &quot;G-1&quot; was assigned (SS-19½) as her official hull number on 12 June 1916. The assigning of half a hull number was an unprecedented move by the Navy, making &quot;G-1&quot; unique amongst all ships in the U.S. Navy. Finally, after a few days of familiarization training, the crew sailed the boat to New London on 23 January 1917.

Once there, &quot;G-1&quot; began her new career as an experimental and instructional submersible. She acted as a schoolship for the newly established Submarine Base and Submarine School at New London, training officers and men of the newly expanded submarine force. Concurrently, given the entry of the United States into World War I, &quot;G-1&quot; tested submarine nets and detector devices for the Experiment Board. She served in a similar capacity at Nahant, Massachusetts, and Provincetown, Massachusetts, assisting the destroyer and steam yacht in the development and use of sound detection devices and experiments with the &quot;K tube,&quot; a communications device. With German U-boats reported off the coast in June 1918, the submarine spent two four-day periscope and listening patrols off Nantucket, Massachusetts, as a defense screen for shipping.

Following the end of the war, &quot;G-1&quot; conducted daily operations with enlisted students in connection with the Listener and Hydrophone School at New London. In August 1919, after a failed inspection by the Board of Inspection and Survey, the boat was laid up at New London in preparation for disposal. Towed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 30 January 1920 she was stripped of useful material and decommissioned on 6 March. She was designated as a target for depth charge experiments under the cognizance of the Bureau of Ordnance on 9 June.

In 1920, &quot;G-1&quot; was redesignated SS-20 even though that hull classification symbol and number had already been given to (ex-&quot;Carp&quot;). &quot;F-1&quot; had sunk in a collision with &quot;F-3&quot; in 1917, so there was no overlap in time of service.

===Target ship===

The minesweeper towed &quot;G-1&quot; back to Narragansett Bay in May 1921. &quot;Grebe&quot; made eight experimental depth charge attacks on &quot;G-1&quot; while the boat lay off Taylor&#x27;s Point on 21 June. Damaged and flooded by those explosions, the battered submarine settled to the bottom in of water. Several attempts to raise her failed and her wreck was officially abandoned. &quot;G-1&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 August 1921.

<text>Blackadder Goes Forth is the fourth series of the BBC sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot;, written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, which aired from 28 September to 2 November 1989 on BBC1. The series placed the recurring characters of Blackadder, Baldrick, and George in a trench in Flanders during World War I, and followed their various doomed attempts to escape from the trenches to avoid death under the misguided command of General Melchett. The series references famous people of the time and criticises the British Army&#x27;s leadership during the campaign, culminating in the ending of its final episode, in which the soldiers are ordered to carry out a lethal charge of enemy lines.

Despite initial concerns that the comedy might trivialise the war, it was acclaimed and won the British Academy Television Award for Best Comedy Series in 1989. In 2000 it was placed 16th by industry professionals in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute.

== Plot ==
&quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; is set in 1917 on the Western Front in the trenches of World War I. Captain Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson) is a professional soldier in the British Army who, until the outbreak of the Great War, has enjoyed a relatively danger-free existence fighting natives who were usually &quot;two feet tall and armed with dried grass&quot;. Finding himself trapped in the trenches with another &quot;big push&quot; planned, his concern is to avoid being sent &quot;over the top&quot; to probable death. The series thus chronicles Blackadder&#x27;s attempts to escape the trenches through various schemes, most of which fail due to bad fortune, misunderstandings and the general incompetence of his comrades. The aforementioned comrades are his second-in-command, idealistic upper-class Edwardian twit Lieutenant George St Barleigh (Hugh Laurie) and their profoundly stupid but dogged batman Private S. Baldrick (Tony Robinson).

More than the Germans, who are generally unseen, Blackadder&#x27;s nemeses come in the form of his superior, the eccentric General Melchett (Stephen Fry) who rallies his troops from a château from the front, and Melchett&#x27;s bureaucratic assistant, Captain Kevin Darling (Tim McInnerny). Despite the two being of equal rank, Blackadder treats Darling with contempt – while the former is on the front line, the latter is &quot;folding the general&#x27;s pyjamas&quot;. Their animosity is mutual, largely as a result of Blackadder exploiting the comic potential of Darling&#x27;s surname at every opportunity.

=== Themes ===
&quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; is darker in tone than the previous three &quot;Blackadder&quot; series and most sitcoms, and presents an anti-war message. The dialogue is marked throughout by satirical musings about the nature of the war, its origins and the effects on the soldiers who suffered over its course. The idea that the soldiers suffered whilst their commanders remained safely distant from the action was also referenced on many occasions, such as when Melchett says to Baldrick, &quot;Don&#x27;t you worry my boy, if you should falter, remember that Captain Darling and I are behind you!&quot;, to which Blackadder responds, &quot;About 35 miles behind you.&quot; In the episode &quot;Corporal Punishment&quot;, Blackadder justifies the shooting for food of a carrier pigeon (which turns out to be Melchett&#x27;s pet, Speckled Jim) by saying, &quot;With 50,000 men getting killed a week, who&#x27;s going to miss a pigeon?&quot; This episode sees Blackadder being sentenced to death by firing squad for the act, a reference to the capital sentences carried out under the laws of war in force at the time.

In &quot;Private Plane&quot;, after receiving word that Blackadder and Baldrick may have been killed when shot down over German lines, Melchett tries to cheer George up by showing him a life-size model (measuring seventeen square feet) of land recaptured by the British, a commentary on the high human cost and small physical gains achieved by attacks in the middle years of the war. Later in the same episode, Blackadder describes the Great War as &quot;a war which would be a damn sight simpler if we just stayed in England and shot 50,000 of our own men a week&quot;.

Field Marshal Douglas Haig, whose orders are alleged to have resulted in hundreds of thousands of British deaths at the battles of Passchendaele and the Somme, is continually referenced. Blackadder himself describes Haig&#x27;s attempts at an advance as no more than &quot;another gargantuan effort to move his drinks cabinet six inches closer to Berlin&quot; and, when asked by Melchett for suggestions to improve the troops&#x27; morale, jokingly suggests Haig&#x27;s resignation and suicide. In &quot;Goodbyeee&quot;, a scene parodies Haig&#x27;s professional abilities by depicting the field marshal (portrayed by Geoffrey Palmer) playing with toy soldiers, which he sweeps nonchalantly from trench to trench and then into a rubbish bin, while listening to Blackadder&#x27;s plea to get out of the big push on the telephone.

The series recalls a number of actual historical events of the war, such as the Christmas truce of 1914. Blackadder recalls the event: &quot;Both sides advanced further during one Christmas piss-up than they did in the next two and a half years of war.&quot; References are also made to the popular culture of the era, as well as the previous series. The episode &quot;Private Plane&quot;, sees the return of the characters of Lord Flashheart and Bob from the second series episode &quot;Bells&quot; and also an appearance of the German flying ace, the Baron von Richthofen. A plot thread in the third episode &quot;Major Star&quot; involves Blackadder&#x27;s dislike of the silent film star Charlie Chaplin, whom he finds &quot;as funny as getting an arrow through the neck, and then finding there&#x27;s a gas bill tied to it&quot;.

In the fifth episode &quot;General Hospital&quot;, the anti-German sentiment in Britain during the war is repeatedly referenced. General Melchett orders Blackadder to find out who is behind the leak in top-secret battle plans and immediately, though erroneously, pins it on a &quot;German spy&quot; (who is later discovered to be one of their own). Blackadder interrogates Captain Darling, who vehemently denies being a spy and says that he is &quot;as British as Queen Victoria&quot;, to which Blackadder sarcastically replies &quot;So your father is German, you&#x27;re half German and you married a German?&quot;. Blackadder&#x27;s retort references the fact that Victoria was a member of the House of Hanover and that her husband Prince Albert was a prince from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1917, Victoria&#x27;s grandson, King George V, changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in an effort to appease British nationalist feelings.

The final episode of this series, &quot;Goodbyeee&quot;, although true to the series&#x27; usual comedy style through most of the preceding scenes, featured a non-comedic final scene, in which the main characters (except General Melchett) are finally sent over the top. Darling keeps some sense of hope, saying this may be the very last battle and history will write the conflict as &quot;The Great War, 1914-1917!&quot;. Disregarding Baldrick&#x27;s claim to have one last plan to save them from the impending doom, Blackadder delivers the final line:

To the sound of a slow, minimal piano version of the title theme, the four are seen in slow-motion, charging into the fog and smoke of no man&#x27;s land, with gunfire and explosions all around, before the scene fades into footage of a sunny poppy field and the sound of birdsong. The fate of the four is left ambiguous.

== Episodes ==

The series aired for six episodes broadcast on BBC1 on Thursdays at 9.30pm between 28 September and 2 November 1989, ending nine days before Remembrance Day. The titles of the first five episodes, &quot;Captain Cook&quot;, &quot;Corporal Punishment&quot;, &quot;Major Star&quot;, &quot;Private Plane&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot; are puns based on the pairing of a military rank and another word related to the episode&#x27;s content. The final episode, &quot;Goodbyeee&quot;, was the title of a period song.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Production ==

=== Writing and rehearsals ===

Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis wrote the scripts for &quot;Blackadder&quot; episodes separately using word processors and then swapped the disks containing the scripts for each other to add or remove jokes and dialogue. Curtis recalls that they stuck to a policy whereby if one removed a line for not being funny, then it was never put back.

During rehearsals, the script was exhaustively discussed and redrafted by the cast, with Richard Curtis having the final say on the content. Fry, Laurie and Atkinson were comic writers and performers themselves, and having worked together on previous series were not afraid to question the script and make suggestions. For example, Captain Darling was originally called Captain Cartwright and was renamed when Stephen Fry recalled a boy at his school with the surname Darling, who had found his own surname a constant embarrassment. Curtis recalls that he was initially reluctant to change the name, as he considered it a one-off joke.

Speaking to &quot;The Times&quot; about the ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the collaborative writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary &quot;Blackadder Rides Again&quot; that: &quot;They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script... sometimes we would just say to them &#x27;if you stood up and tried to act this script out, you would find out things about it.&#x27;&quot; Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.

During &quot;Blackadder Rides Again&quot;, Tony Robinson likewise recalls that these script meetings could be uncomfortable, and has been less reserved speaking about the script rehearsals since. In an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; he suggests that although relations between the actors were generally cordial &quot;There was bad feeling between the writers and the performers – the writers felt we were unilaterally altering the script and altering it for the worse. At end of the first day of rehearsals, the writers would go away and by the time they came back we would have changed an awful lot of it. By the end, they felt we had run away with it. There were quite a lot of emotions flashing around about that.&quot;

Producer John Lloyd, speaking to &quot;The Times&quot; in 1989, hinted that it was the draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to the writers deciding not to make another series: 

=== Casting ===

Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson reprised their roles as Edmund Blackadder and Baldrick respectively. Hugh Laurie also returned to play Lieutenant George. The fourth series enlarged the principal cast from the third series to include Stephen Fry as General Melchett and Tim McInnerny as Captain Kevin Darling, who had both appeared in guest roles in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; and had appeared regularly in &quot;Blackadder II&quot;. This cast appeared together in every episode of the fourth series, although the only episode to feature no guest appearances was &quot;Captain Cook&quot;. Miranda Richardson, who had played Elizabeth I in the second series, appeared in a guest role in one episode (as she had in the third series). In their guest performances, actors such as Rik Mayall and Gabrielle Glaister reprised versions of characters they had played in earlier series. Other performers, such as Bill Wallis and Lee Cornes, who had played minor roles in prior series, appeared briefly again in the fourth series as well. Of the series, only Adrian Edmondson and Geoffrey Palmer portray fictitious takes on historical figures as Baron Manfred von Richthofen and Field Marshal Douglas Haig respectively.

=== Taping ===

This series of Blackadder was one of the first television programmes in Britain to be made and transmitted with stereo sound, using the NICAM digital system, even though most viewers could only afford, or were only able to receive due to their location, the standard FM mono audio carrier signal.

The series was directed by Richard Boden and all interior scenes were shot at BBC Television Centre in front of a live studio audience. Rowan Atkinson recalls that the studio shooting could present him with problems:

That sitcom tradition is very strange when you&#x27;re performing to both a camera and an audience at the same time...The thing that sometimes held us up is my stammer. Some words and some phrases did catch me out...&quot;B&quot;s in particular. I remember one episode in which Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie were going &quot;woof&quot; a lot, and my line was &quot;it&#x27;s like Battersea Dogs Home in here&quot;. The B of Battersea was a problem for me. The floor manager suggested that I say &quot;Crufts&quot; instead.

Atkinson has said that in the build-up to the final episode, he began to psychologically experience something of his character&#x27;s apprehension. Speaking to Michael Parkinson in 2003, he recalled 

Other than the title sequence, the series used little exterior shooting. To create the flying sequences in the episode &quot;Private Plane&quot;, footage from the 1976 film &quot;Aces High&quot; was re-edited and dubbed over with the actors&#x27; voices. The most challenging scene to shoot was the final &quot;over the top&quot; sequence, which was recorded in a separate studio set, away from the audience, which had been rigged with special effects to simulate a battlefield.

On viewing the original studio rushes for the 20th anniversary documentary &quot;Blackadder Rides Again&quot;, John Lloyd recalls that originally the final scene was &quot;all very embarrassing&quot;, as the actors only had to run before they reached the barbed wire in front of the camera, where they had to pretend to die, an effect described by Atkinson as &quot;somewhat unconvincing&quot;. It was only in post-production that the final effect was achieved by running the video and audio in slow motion and fading another video of the empty set over the top to make it appear as if the characters had disappeared. This image of a barren landscape was then faded into a still image of a poppy field found in the BBC Picture Library.

=== Titles and music ===

The theme melody was a variation on the &quot;Blackadder&quot; theme by Howard Goodall over opening title images of Blackadder and George parading their men past Melchett and Darling, while Baldrick plays the triangle. The title music starts with the opening bars of &quot;The British Grenadiers&quot; before segueing into the familiar &quot;Blackadder&quot; theme. In the closing credits, the full &quot;Blackadder&quot; theme plays over visuals of armed men marching on a parade ground. The sequences were filmed and recorded on location at the former Colchester Cavalry Barracks, with the production using 50 members of the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Anglian Regiment to represent Blackadder&#x27;s men, attired in reproduction First World War uniforms, with the battalion&#x27;s band providing the music.

The titles are presented as static captions instead of being rolled as in the previous three series. The crew credits are presented in pseudo-military fashion: for example, the designer is credited thus: &quot;Dgr – 404371 Hull, C&quot;. The opening sequence is filmed in colour, while the closing sequence was treated in post-production to appear grainy, streaky, and sepia toned in imitation of newsreels of the era.

&quot;Goodbyeee&quot; has no closing titles, simply fading from the protagonists charging across no man&#x27;s land under fire, to a field of poppies in the sunlight, a reference to the poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; and the flower&#x27;s symbolic significance. The music was also changed to a slow, echoey solo piano arrangement (recorded in a school gymnasium), finishing with three strong bass-drum notes, interposed with sound effects of gunshot, and later birdsong. In the 25th anniversary special interview, Richard Curtis stated that the production team had not planned such an ending and the idea of the scene fading to the poppy field was only conceived after some of the cast stated their reluctance in doing a second take.

== Reception ==

=== Subject ===
Emma Hanna, in her book &quot;The Great War on the Small Screen&quot;, has noted that some contemporary reviewers felt the topic of the First World War to be inappropriate for a comedy series, with one newspaper critic uncertain of the writers&#x27; motives: &quot;is [the series] justified in using tragic situations as a springboard for comedy merely for entertainment value?&quot;. Ben Elton&#x27;s uncle, the historian Geoffrey Elton, &quot;was at first most unhappy at what he considered to be an insulting portrayal of the army&quot;, although &quot;he later took the view that the satire was drawn with great respect&quot;.

The issue of the series&#x27; subject matter was of concern to the producers. Atkinson recalled in an interview with Michael Parkinson that the poignant ending of the final episode was in part written to counter the possibility of criticism that the subject was inappropriate for a comedy. Speaking during filming in 1989, he remarked that despite the 20th century setting, the trenches were particularly apt for the &quot;Blackadder&quot; series:
We wanted a place and a time that could reproduce to a certain extent the claustrophobia and the sordidness of medieval England, and the best way to do that is to set it in the middle of a war.

Co-writer Richard Curtis has said that before writing the series, the writers read a number of books about the war and decided that the First World War was a particularly apt subject for a situation comedy, finding that &quot;actually, all the lead up to the first world war was very funny, all the people coming from communities where they&#x27;d never bumped into posh people...and all being so gung ho and optimistic...the first hundred pages of any book about the world war are hilarious; then of course everybody dies.&quot;

Michael Brooke, assessing the series for the British Film Institute, suggests that the characterisation and pervading sense of danger prevented the sitcom from trivialising its subject matter: &quot;The prospect of its characters suddenly dying a violent death provided a constant source of tension and gags, though when they really were killed off at the end of the final episode...the result was so unexpectedly moving that the programme was later repeated as part of an otherwise wholly serious BBC2 Armistice Day programme without anyone batting an eyelid.&quot;

=== Awards ===

The series won the British Academy Television Award for Best Comedy Series in 1989. In addition, for his performance as Captain Blackadder, Rowan Atkinson won Best Light Entertainment Performance. In 2000, the series was placed 16th by industry professionals in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute. In 2004, championed by John Sergeant, the whole &quot;Blackadder&quot; series came second in the BBC poll to find Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom with 282,106 votes.

=== Legacy ===

Journalists and historians have noted that the television series has become a pervasive view of the war in the public&#x27;s perception of World War I, with Max Hastings calling the common British view of the war &quot;the &quot;Blackadder&quot; take on history&quot;. Military historian Richard Holmes commented in his book &quot;The Western Front&quot;: &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s aphorisms have become fact... A well-turned line of script can sometimes carry more weight than all the scholarly footnotes in the world.&quot; Stephen Badsey, analysing trends in television programmes about the war, remarked that &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; as a popular comedy series was subject to particular criticism from historians, remarking that the series &quot;consciously traded on every cliche and misremembered piece of history about the Western Front, and was influential enough to draw a surprising degree of angry criticism from professional historians as a result.&quot;

The series has prompted debate among politicians in the UK. In 2014, it was the subject of a public dispute between Conservative politician Michael Gove, then serving as Secretary of State for Education, and Labour activist Tony Robinson, who portrayed Baldrick, after Gove had written that it presented the war as &quot;a misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite. Even to this day there are left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths.&quot; Robinson responded &quot;to categorise teachers who would introduce something like &quot;Blackadder&quot; as left-wing and introducing left-wing propaganda is very, very unhelpful. And I think it&#x27;s particularly unhelpful and irresponsible for a minister in charge of education.&quot; Tristram Hunt also criticised Gove&#x27;s comments, but Andrew Murrison compared the series to &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot; as a take on history that had &quot;sadly been in the ascendant for the past 50 years&quot;.

Esther MacCallum-Stewart of Sussex University noted in her essay &quot;Television Docu-Drama and The First World War&quot; that &quot;&quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; is used as a teaching aid in schools; not as a secondary text that should be analysed and discussed for its own reliability, but as a truthful parody of the conditions of the First World War.&quot; Broadcaster Jeremy Paxman criticised schools for relying on episodes of &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; to teach pupils about the conflict.

<text>HMAS &quot;Cowra&quot; (J351/M351), named for the town of Cowra, New South Wales, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==
In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Cowra&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Cowra&quot; was laid down by Poole &amp; Steel at Balmain, New South Wales on 12 August 1942. She was launched on 27 May 1943 by the wife of Percy Spender, the Federal Treasurer and member of the Advisory War Council, and was commissioned into the RAN on 8 October 1943.

==Operational history==
&quot;Cowra&quot; began active service in November 1943 as a convoy escort along the east coast of Australia. She continued until March 1944, when she was reassigned to New Guinea as an escort and anti-submarine patrol vessel. In June 1944, the corvette sailed to Melbourne for refits, which concluded on 19 August. She returned to New Guinea at the end of the month, and for the next eleven months was primarily assigned to escort and patrol duties near Morotai. In January 1945, &quot;Cowra&quot; fired on Japanese shore positions at Yalela Bay, before visiting Brisbane briefly in February 1945. On 17 July, she was recalled to Australian waters, where she spent the rest of World War II. The ship was awarded two battle honours—&quot;Pacific 1943–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1944&quot;—for her wartime service.

Following the end of the war, &quot;Cowra&quot; was assigned to the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla, and performed mine clearance operations in the waters of Australia, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. On 2 December 1946, &quot;Cowra&quot; returned to Sydney and was decommissioned into reserve.

On 20 February 1951, &quot;Cowra&quot; was recommissioned for use as a training ship for National Service trainees.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Cowra&quot; was paid off for the second time on 26 June 1953. In January 1961, the corvette was sold to the Kinoshita Company of Japan for scrapping.

A memorial to the ship located outside the Cowra Services Club was dedicated on 15 March 2006.

<text>The Black Adder is the first series of the BBC sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot;, written by Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson, directed by Martin Shardlow and produced by John Lloyd. The series was originally aired on BBC1 from 15 June 1983 to 20 July 1983,
and was a joint production with the Australian Seven Network. Set in 1485 at the end of the British Middle Ages, the series is written as a secret history which contends that King Richard III won the Battle of Bosworth Field, only to be unintentionally assassinated by his nephew&#x27;s son Edmund and succeeded by said nephew, Richard IV, one of the Princes in the Tower. The series follows the exploits of Richard IV&#x27;s unfavoured second son Edmund (who calls himself &quot;The Black Adder&quot;) in his various attempts to increase his standing with his father and, in the final episode, his quest to overthrow him.

Conceived while Atkinson and Curtis were working on &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, the series presents medieval issues in Britain in a humorous and often anachronistic manner—witchcraft, royal succession, European relations, the Crusades and the conflict between the Crown and the Church. The filming of the series was ambitious, as it featured a large cast and required extensive location shooting. Shakespearean dialogue is sometimes adapted for comic effect. Despite winning an International Emmy, &quot;The Black Adder&quot; is regarded by its creators and most critics as the weakest &quot;Blackadder&quot; series.

A second series, &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, aired in 1986.

==Plot==
Set in the Middle Ages, the series is written as an alternative history. It opens on 21 August 1485, the eve of the Battle of Bosworth Field, which in the series is won not by Henry Tudor (as in reality) but by Richard III. Richard III, played by Peter Cook, is presented as a good king who doted on his nephews, contrary to the Shakespearean view of him as a hunchbacked, infanticidal monster.

After his victory in the battle, Richard III is unintentionally killed by Lord Edmund Plantagenet; Richard attempts to take Edmund&#x27;s horse, which he was only borrowing for losing his own steed. Not recognizing the king, Edmund thinks Richard is stealing it and cuts his head off. The late King&#x27;s nephew, Richard, Duke of York (played by Brian Blessed) who is Lord Edmund Plantagenet&#x27;s father, is then crowned as Richard IV. Lord Edmund himself did not take part in the battle after arriving late, but later claims to have killed 450 peasants and several nobles, one of whom had actually been killed by his brother in the battle.

King Richard IV of England and XII of Scotland and his Queen Gertrude of Flanders have two sons: Harry, Prince of Wales and his younger brother Prince Edmund. Though Harry is by far their father&#x27;s favourite, the King barely acknowledging his second son&#x27;s existence, he is often depicted as simple-minded and easy to fool unlike Edmund, though he still treats Edmund with kindness and respect. It is a running gag throughout the series that Edmund&#x27;s father cannot even remember his name. However, despite his mostly dismissive attitude toward his second son, the King actually loves Edmund very dearly, partially due to their father-son relationship; in the third episode, when Edmund becomes the Archbishop of Canterbury and helps his father to secure some land from a dying noble before the church can, the King proudly acknowledges Edmund as his son, embraces him and even mentions to the Queen that Edmund has &quot;turned out well&quot;, and in the series&#x27; finale, on Edmund&#x27;s deathbed, the King does his best to console him, assuring him that his soul will go to Heaven, and has the entire court drink a toast in his honour.

Using this premise, the series follows the fictitious reign of Richard IV (1485–1498) through the experiences of Prince Edmund, who styles himself as &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, and his two sidekicks: the imbecilic Lord Percy Percy, the Duke of Northumberland (Tim McInnerny); and Baldrick (Tony Robinson), a more intelligent servant who Edmund takes on as his squire.

By the end of the series, events converge with accepted history. King Richard IV and his entire family are accidentally killed with wine poisoned by Percy meant for the Black Seal who had actually arrived to overthrow Richard IV, allowing Henry Tudor to come out of hiding and take the throne as King Henry VII. He then rewrites history, presenting Richard III as a monster, and eliminating Richard IV&#x27;s reign from the history books. In reality, Richard, Duke of York, one of the Princes in the Tower, was only twelve years old (and perhaps two years dead) when the Battle of Bosworth Field took place in 1485, and thus too young to have had two adult sons. Henry Tudor seemingly also falsified the history of Scotland and Ireland: Richard IV is said to be king of England, Scotland and Ireland, and Prince Edmund has the title of Duke of Edinburgh, whereas in reality Ireland was not a kingdom until 1542 and Scotland continued to have a separate royal house until 1603.

==Episodes==

The episodes in this series, written by Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis, were originally shown on BBC1 on Wednesday evenings, 21:25–22:00. Each episode ran for roughly 33 minutes. The series began on 15 June 1983.

Each of the episodes was based on a medieval theme – the Wars of the Roses, the Crusades and royal succession, the conflict between the Crown and the Church, arranged marriages between monarchies, the Plague and witchcraft, and a planned coup d&#x27;état in the final episode.

The series was broadcast shortly after the BBC Television Shakespeare productions of Shakespeare&#x27;s four plays about the Wars of the Roses: the three-part &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays, followed by &quot;Richard III&quot;, which was first shown on 23 January 1983. Some of the same actors were used to enhance the parody of Shakespearean history. Ron Cook, who played Richard III in the Shakespeare productions, is cast as the villainous &quot;Sean the Irish Bastard&quot;. Peter Benson, who played Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry VI, played Henry VII in the first episode.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===Character development===
In this series, the character of the Black Adder is somewhat different from later incarnations, being largely unintelligent, naive, and snivelling. The character does evolve through the series, however, and he begins showing signs of what his descendants will be like by the final episode, where he begins insulting everyone around him and making his own plans. This evolution follows naturally from the character&#x27;s situation. &quot;The Black Adder&quot; is the title that Edmund adopts during the first episode (after first considering &quot;The Black Vegetable&quot;). Presumably one of his descendants adopted it as a surname before &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, in which the title character becomes &quot;Edmund Blackadder&quot;. Furthermore, Baldrick is shown in more favourable and intelligent light here than in subsequent series – his &#x27;cunning plans&#x27; are typically superior to and more workable than Edmund&#x27;s own. Starting from the second series, the characters&#x27; relative intelligence and naiveté clearly switch.

==Production==

===Development===
Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis developed the idea for the sitcom while working on &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. Eager to avoid comparisons to the critically acclaimed &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, they proposed the idea of a historical sitcom. An unaired pilot episode was made in 1982, and a six-episode series was commissioned.

In the unaired pilot episode, covering the basic plot of &quot;Born to Be King&quot;, Rowan Atkinson speaks, dresses and generally looks and acts like the later Blackadder descendants of the second series onwards, but no reason is given as to why he was instead changed to a snivelling wretch for the first series. Richard Curtis has stated he cannot remember the exact reason, but has suggested it was because they wanted to have a more complicated character (implying that the change was driven by the writing) instead of a swaggering lead from the pilot.

Curtis admitted in a 2004 documentary that just before recording began, producer John Lloyd came up to him with Atkinson and asked what Edmund&#x27;s character was. Curtis then realised that, despite writing some funny lines, he had no idea how Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his part. On the 25th anniversary documentary &quot;Blackadder Rides Again&quot;, Atkinson added that as the cameras were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn&#x27;t even sure what voice to use for the character.

===Filming===

The budget for the series was considerable, with much location shooting particularly at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland and the surrounding countryside in February 1983. Brinkburn Priory, an authentic reconstruction of a medieval monastery church, was used for the episode &quot;The Archbishop&quot;. The series also used large casts of extras, as well as horses and expensive medieval-style costumes. Filming at the castle was hindered by bad weather – snow is visible in many of the outdoor location shots.

For the duration of the production, Atkinson endured having his hair trimmed in an unflattering medieval style and wearing a selection of &quot;priapic codpieces&quot;.
Atkinson has said about the making of the first series:

The first series was odd, it was very extravagant. It cost a million pounds for the six programmes ... [which] was a lot of money to spend ... It looked great, but it wasn&#x27;t as consistently funny as we would have liked.

===Cast===

Robinson said in 2003 that he was originally flattered to be offered a part and it was only later he found that other small-part actors had also been offered the role and turned it down. The series guest-starred noted actors including Peter Cook and Peter Benson in &quot;The Foretelling&quot;; Miriam Margolyes and Jim Broadbent in &quot;The Queen of Spain&#x27;s Beard&quot;; Frank Finlay in &quot;Witchsmeller Pursuivant&quot;; and Rik Mayall and Patrick Allen (who also narrated the series) in &quot;The Black Seal&quot;.

===Title sequence and music===
The title sequence included stock shots of Edmund riding his horse on location, interspersed with shots of him doing silly things (and, usually, a shot of King Richard IV to go with Brian Blessed&#x27;s credit). The closing titles were a similar sequence of Edmund riding, eventually falling off his horse, after which the camera continues following the horse as it goes on running. All the credits of the first series featured eccentric orderings of the cast list (such as &quot;order of precedence&quot;, &quot;order of witchiness&quot; and &quot;order of disappearance&quot;) and included &quot;with additional dialogue by William Shakespeare&quot; and &quot;made in glorious television&quot;.

The series used the first incarnation of the &quot;Blackadder&quot; theme by Howard Goodall (with the exception of the unaired pilot, which featured a different arrangement). For the opening theme, a trumpet solo accompanied by an orchestra was used. For the end titles, the theme gained mock-heroic lyrics sung by a baritone (Simon Carrington, a member of the King&#x27;s Singers). In the final episode, the theme was sung with altered lyrics by a treble, in a more reflective style. The series&#x27; incidental music was unusually performed by pipe organ and percussion.

==Awards and criticism==
The series won an International Emmy award in the popular arts category in 1983. The four series of &quot;Blackadder&quot; were voted into second place in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; in 2004 with 282,106 votes, although the series&#x27; advocate, John Sergeant, was not complimentary of the first series, suggesting it was &quot;grandiose, confused and expensive&quot;.

Members of the cast and crew, looking back for the documentary &quot;Blackadder Rides Again&quot;, are also not particularly complimentary of the first series. John Lloyd recalls that a colleague commented at the time that the series &quot;looks a million dollars, but cost a million pounds&quot;, although he admits that they were proud of the result at the time. Due to the high cost of the first series, the controller of BBC1 when the second series was commissioned, Michael Grade, was reluctant to authorise a second series without major cost-cutting, leaving a gap of three years before &quot;Blackadder II&quot; was broadcast, on the condition that it remained largely studio-bound.

==Releases==
The complete series of &quot;The Black Adder&quot; is available as a Region 2 DVD from BBC Worldwide, as well as in a complete box set with the other series. The series is also available in Region 1 DVD in a box set of the complete series. &quot;The Complete Collected Series 1, 2, 3, 4 and Specials&quot;, a 15-disc complete set of audiobooks published by BBC Audiobooks Ltd, was released in 2009. A selection of one-off episodes, documentaries and other appearances by &quot;Blackadder&quot; are featured, with some of this extra material being released on audio for the first time.

In December of 2023 &#x27;The Black Adder&#x27; was released on Blu Ray as part of a &#x27;Complete Collection&#x27; of all four series&#x27; (plus specials and extras). 
All episodes have apparently been restored and remastered along with being upscaled.

===VHS releases===
On 5 February 1990, BBC Enterprises Ltd released all 6 episodes of &quot;The Black Adder&quot; on two single videos and on 7 September 1992 all 6 episodes of &quot;The Blackadder&quot; were re-released on &#x27;Complete&#x27; double VHS releases. All 6 episodes were re-released on a single video release on 2 October 1995.

===LaserDisc release===
&quot;The Black Adder&quot; was released on a double LaserDisc set by Encore Entertainment in 1996. Due to the unequal length of the episodes, they were presented on the set slightly out of sequence.

<text>Blackadder II is the second series of the BBC sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot;, written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, which aired from 9 January 1986 to 20 February 1986. The series is set in England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603), and sees the principal character, Edmund, Lord Blackadder, as a Tudor courtier attempting to win the favour of the Queen while avoiding execution by decapitation, a fate that befell many of her suitors.

The series is the successor to &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, and differed significantly from its predecessor, notably with Ben Elton replacing Rowan Atkinson as the second writer, filming in studio sets, rather than on location, the introduction of a Machiavellian Blackadder and a less intelligent Baldrick.

A third series, &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;, aired in 1987.

==Plot==
The series is set during the Elizabethan era (1558–1603). The principal character, Edmund, Lord Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), is the great-grandson of the original Black Adder and is now a member of the London aristocracy. Unlike his forefather, he is both dashing and intelligent, although he is still scheming and cynical in his outlook. The series follows his attempts to win the favour of the childish Queen Elizabeth I (Miranda Richardson). As before, he is aided, and often hindered, by two less-than-intelligent sidekicks, his servant Baldrick (Tony Robinson), and Lord Percy Percy (Tim McInnerny), heir to the Duchy of Northumberland, with whom Blackadder has a grudging friendship.

Throughout the series, Blackadder&#x27;s chief rival is Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry), the Queen&#x27;s pretentious and grovelling Lord Chamberlain. Melchett fears upsetting the Queen, and thus attempts to outdo Blackadder by supporting the Queen in whatever current fad she is interested in. Comic relief in the Court is provided by the Queen&#x27;s demented former nanny, Nursie (Patsy Byrne) who often reveals embarrassing stories about Queenie&#x27;s past.

The series finale episode, &quot;Chains&quot; sees Blackadder and Melchett being kidnapped by two guards working for Prince Ludwig the Indestructible (Hugh Laurie) who holds them prisoner in a dungeon, Ludwig demanding a ransom be paid in exchange for having one of them released but after receiving a message informing them Queenie has decided to ignore saving them in favour of holding a big party, which later becomes a costume party, the two men, whose original death sentences are later changed to life imprisonment, work together to successfully outwit Ludwig&#x27;s guards and return to England, arriving at the palace in time to stop Ludwig from killing Queenie and fulfilling his goal of becoming King of England, which was revealed to have been brought on the fact that as a child, he had dirty hair, spots and was forced to wear shorts by his mother, earning him ridicule from his classmates who also gave him the nickname, &quot;Shorty Greasy Spot-Spot&quot; which Ludwig despises so much so that he flies into a rage if it is mentioned in his presence. Upon being exposed, Ludwig attempts to flee while vowing he will return and get his revenge, but is presumably killed or wounded off-screen by a dagger that Blackadder throws at him, ending his threat. However, after the end credits have been shown, Ludwig is revealed to have survived the attack, returning to murder the original Queenie and after stealing her identity, also gone on to kill Blackadder, Melchett, Nursie, Baldrick and Percy, Ludwig presumably going on to rule England for many years, disguised as Queenie.

Baldrick, who in the first series was the most intelligent of the main trio, became more stupid, an idea proposed by Ben Elton to make him &quot;the stupidest person in the history of...human beings&quot;, and to act as a foil to Blackadder&#x27;s new-found intelligence. The series was also the originator of Baldrick&#x27;s obsession with the turnip, although this apparently arose from a botanical error on the part of Elton, who confused the vegetable with the &quot;amusingly shaped&quot; parsnip.

Lord Percy remained similar in character to the original series, as a foolish sidekick in Blackadder&#x27;s plots and predicaments. In this respect, McInnerny said the character resembled Sir Andrew Aguecheek in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. As with &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, the series featured many tongue-in-cheek references to Shakespeare&#x27;s plays; Shakespeare is mentioned as a contemporary Elizabethan, and his famous quotations are twisted for comic effect. The first episode &quot;Bells&quot;, follows a similar plot to &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

==Episodes==

The series aired for six episodes broadcast on Thursdays on BBC1 at 9.30pm between 9 January 1986 and 20 February 1986.

&quot;Head&quot; was originally intended to be the first episode and was first to be filmed. This resulted in the small continuity error of Lord Percy still having a beard in &quot;Head&quot; which he shaves off in &quot;Bells&quot;. In addition, during the early scenes of &quot;Head&quot;, the principal characters are introduced to the audience with Baldrick&#x27;s stupidity highlighted.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Production==

===Development===
Due to the high cost of the first series, Michael Grade (the then controller of programming of BBC1) was reluctant to sign off a second series without major improvements and cost-cutting, leaving a gap of three years between the two series.

Rowan Atkinson did not wish to continue writing for the second series, so writer and stand-up comedian Ben Elton was chosen to replace him. According to producer John Lloyd, Ben Elton was particularly keen on the choice of the Elizabethan age for the series, because it was &quot;a sexy age that the kids can relate to.&quot; As a stand-up comic, Elton often acted as the studio warm-up comic to amuse the audience before filming began. The scripts were also tightened up during principal rehearsals with the actors; according to Richard Curtis, an entire script for a murder mystery-style episode was dropped because the writers felt it did not work.

===Filming===
To make the show more cost-effective, it was principally filmed on specially designed small sets at BBC Television Centre created by designer Tony Thorpe. The sets were de-constructed and rebuilt during the period of studio filming, as was normal for studio series then. In particular, the Queen&#x27;s throne room and Blackadder&#x27;s front room were featured in every episode, with only two further unique sets per episode, including an execution chamber in &quot;Head&quot; and a Spanish dungeon in &quot;Chains&quot;. Only one outside location shoot was used in the whole series, which took place before principal filming on Thursday 30 May 1985 at Wilton House, Wiltshire. These outdoor scenes were Blackadder&#x27;s courting scene in &quot;Bells&quot; and the end title sequences. Studio recordings shot in front of a live audience began on Sunday 9 June 1985 with the recording of &quot;Head&quot;. Subsequent episodes were filmed on a weekly basis in the sequence &quot;Bells&quot;, &quot;Potato&quot;, &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Beer&quot; and &quot;Chains&quot;. Director Mandie Fletcher was keen for the action to be shot spontaneously and was averse to complex costume changes or special effects which required recording to be halted. She is reputed to have said filming it was &quot;a bit like doing Shakespeare in front of an audience – it&#x27;s not at all like doing sitcom.&quot;

===Cast===
The size of the principal cast was reduced compared to the previous series, with a fixed number of characters appearing in every episode. Richard Curtis has been quoted as saying that due to the familiar cast, the series was the happiest for him to work on, comparing it to a &quot;friendly bunch of school chums&quot;.

* Rowan Atkinson as Lord Edmund Blackadder
* Tim McInnerny as Lord Percy Percy, Heir to the Duchy of Northumberland
* Tony Robinson as Baldrick
* Miranda Richardson as Queen Elizabeth I of England
* Stephen Fry as Lord Melchett, the Lord Chamberlain
* Patsy Byrne as Nursie

The series also featured at least one significant cameo role per episode. Notable appearances include Rik Mayall as the debonair Lord Flashheart in &quot;Bells&quot;; Tom Baker and Simon Jones as Captain Redbeard Rum and Sir Walter Raleigh respectively, in &quot;Potato&quot;; Ronald Lacey as the baby-eating Bishop of Bath and Wells in &quot;Money&quot;; Miriam Margolyes, who had appeared in the previous series, as the puritanical Lady Whiteadder in &quot;Beer&quot;; and Stephen Fry&#x27;s comedy partner Hugh Laurie, who appears twice, first as the drunken Simon Partridge in &quot;Beer&quot; and in the final episode as the evil Prince Ludwig. Laurie was later given a larger role as Prince George in the next two series. Also Bob, played by Gabrielle Glaister, a former classmate of Ben Elton&#x27;s, made her first appearance. Several of the characters were seen in similar guises in later series.

===Music and titles===
The opening titles are accompanied by a mock-Elizabethan arrangement of Howard Goodall&#x27;s &quot;Blackadder&quot; theme played on a recorder and an electric guitar, and feature a black snake slithering about on a marble table. The snake, non-compliant to the wishes of its handler, is eventually removed and replaced with something related to the episode title, which in this series is always a single noun. The opening ominous string crescendo and imagery are a parody of the opening credits of &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, the 1976 BBC television adaptation of Robert Graves&#x27; novel of the same name.

The closing titles use a different arrangement of the theme, sung by countertenor Jeremy Jackman, with lyrics (usually insulting Blackadder) that reflect the events of the preceding episode. The song is played over a shot of Blackadder strolling through a formal garden and being annoyed by the lute-wielding minstrel (Tony Aitken). This sequence was incorporated as a separate subplot, with Blackadder constantly attempting to apprehend the musician each time with limited success. At the end of the final episode, Blackadder catches the minstrel and repeatedly dunks him in a fountain.

==Releases==
The complete series of &quot;Blackadder II&quot; is available as a Region 2 DVD from BBC Worldwide, as well as in a complete box-set with the other series, most recently as a remastered edition including a commentary on selected episodes. An earlier VHS release of the series was also produced in 1996. The series is also available in Region 1 DVD in a box-set of the complete series. In addition, an audio recording taken from the television episodes is available on cassette and compact disc.

===VHS releases===

* In about October 1989, BBC Enterprises Ltd released all six episodes of &quot;Blackadder II&quot; on two single videos; they were re-released on 7 September 1992 in &#x27;Complete&#x27;, a double-VHS box set. All six episodes were re-released on a single video on 2 October 1995.

===DVD releases===
===LaserDisc release===
&quot;Blackadder II&quot; was released on a double LaserDisc set by Encore Entertainment in 1996., the episodes spread over three of the four sides.

<text>There are two main types of congressional committees in the United States House of Representatives, standing committees and select committees. Committee chairs are selected by whichever party is in the majority, and the minority party selects ranking members to lead them. The committees and party conferences may have rules determining term limits for leadership and membership, though waivers can be issued. While the Democrats and Republicans differ on the exact processes by which committee leadership and assignments are chosen, most standing committees are selected by the respective party steering committees and ratified by the party conferences. The Ethics, House Administration, Rules and all select committees are chosen by the party leaders (Speaker in the majority and Minority Leader in the minority). Most committees are additionally subdivided into subcommittees, each with its own leadership selected according to the full committee&#x27;s rules. The only standing committee with no subcommittees is the Budget Committee.

The modern House committees were brought into existence through the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. This bill reduced the number of House committees, as well as restructured the committees&#x27; jurisdictions.

== Standing committees ==
== Non-standing committees ==
==Party leadership==
Each party determines their committees leads, who serve as chair in the majority and ranking member in the minority. The table below lists the tenure of when each member was selected for their current term as committee lead. The Republican party rules stipulate that their leads of standing committees may serve no more than three congressional terms (two years each) as chair or ranking member unless the full party conference grants them a waiver to do so. The current majority party is listed first for each committee.

<doc id="438531" wikidata="Q5112953" url="?curid=438531" title="Anchors Aweigh">
<text>&quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; is the fight song of the United States Naval Academy and unofficial march song of the United States Navy. It was composed in 1906 by Charles A. Zimmermann with lyrics by Alfred Hart Miles. When he composed &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, Zimmermann was a lieutenant and had been bandmaster of the United States Naval Academy Band since 1887. Miles was midshipman first class at the academy, in the class of 1907, and had asked Zimmermann to assist him in composing a song for that class, to be used as a football march. Another academy midshipman, Royal Lovell (class of 1926), later wrote what would be adopted into the song as its third verse. Another member of the Naval Academy Band, Willy Perlitz Jr., assisting in writing the music for the different instruments used in &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Weigh anchor&quot; is an old English sailors&#x27; expression first referenced in literature in John Dryden&#x27;s The Tempest, 1670. It is an order that a ship&#x27;s anchors be raised,
To &quot;weigh anchor&quot; is to bring all anchor(s) aboard the vessel in preparation for departure. In response to the order, the phrase &quot;anchors aweigh&quot; reports back that &quot;all&quot; anchors are clear of the sea bottom; therefore the ship is officially &quot;under way&quot;.

&quot;Anchors aweigh&quot; is often misspelled as &quot;Anchor&#x27;s away&quot;, leading to confusing the terms, and sometimes misunderstanding the order as meaning &quot;to drop anchor&quot;. Confusion may also occur over two correct spellings typically encountered: that is, &quot;anchor&#x27;s&quot; with an apostrophe, and without (&quot;anchors&quot;). Here the phrase &quot;anchor&#x27;s aweigh&quot;, (denoting a &quot;single&quot; anchor plus the contraction of the verb &quot;is&quot;) means: &quot;this&quot; anchor is raised. The &quot;single&quot; phrase must be distinguished from the &quot;plural&quot; &quot;anchors aweigh&quot;, which reports that &quot;all&quot; anchors of the ship are raised.

Although the original (now archaic) &quot;aweigh&quot; is verbal and transitive, the &quot;aweigh&quot; used now is adjectival/adverbial in nature and meaning. &quot;Weigh&quot; as a verb means to &quot;bear&quot; or &quot;move&quot;, thus giving it several shades of meaning and derivation, including &quot;weight&quot; or &quot;heaviness&quot;.

==Composition==
Many arrangements of the song exist, but the original composition by Zimmermann from 1906, is labelled as a &quot;March and Two-Step&quot; and consists of a lengthy instrumental march introductory section, which then becomes a two-step with lyrical accompaniment approximately halfway into the piece.

Many arrangements of &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; exist today, one arrangement by Paul V. Yoder often sees use by military bands, such as those of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, the Bundeswehr, and other nations&#x27; militaries.

==History==

The song was first played during the Army–Navy football game on December 1, 1906, at Franklin Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Navy won the game 10–0 before a crowd in excess of 30,000, their first win in the matchup since 1900.

The song was gradually adopted as the song of the U.S. Navy; although there is a pending proposal to make it the official song, and to incorporate protocol into Navy regulations for its performance, its status remains unofficial. Its lyrics were considered too specific to the Academy and not representative of the Navy at large, and so were rewritten by George D. Lottman (note the reference to &quot;farewell to college joys&quot;). Its melody was also slightly rewritten by Domenico Savino.

The song has a joyful, brisk melody, and it has been adopted by several other navies around the world, such as the Finnish Navy. In addition to being bandmaster at the Naval Academy, Zimmerman was also the organist at St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church in Annapolis, and the opening notes of the melody to &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; bear a marked similarity (although in a different tempo) to the opening of the ancient Marian hymn Salve Regina, with which Zimmerman would have been thoroughly familiar.

During World War II, members of the Navy Women&#x27;s Reserve, known more popularly as the WAVES, wrote &quot;WAVES of the Navy&quot; to harmonize with &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;.

Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album &quot;101 Gang Songs&quot; (1961).

==Lyrics==
&quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1906 version), which is still used today at the Naval Academy.

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Stand Navy down the field, sails set to the sky;
We&#x27;ll never change our course, So Army you steer shy-y-y-y.
Roll up the score, Navy, anchors aweigh!
Sail Navy down the field and sink the Army, sink the Army grey!

Get under way Navy, decks cleared for the fray;
We&#x27;ll hoist true Navy Blue, So Army down your grey-y-y-y;
Full speed ahead, Navy; Army heave to;
Furl Black and Grey and Gold, and hoist the Navy, hoist the Navy Blue!

Blue of the Seven Seas; Gold of God&#x27;s Great Sun
Let these our colors be till all of time be done, done, done,
By Severn&#x27;s shore we learn Navy&#x27;s stern call:
Faith, Courage, Service true, with Honor, Over Honor, Over All.&lt;/poem&gt;

Revised Lyrics of 1926 by George D. Lottman:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Stand, Navy, out to sea, Fight our battle cry;
We&#x27;ll never change our course, So vicious foe steer shy-y-y-y.
Roll out the TNT, Anchors Aweigh. Sail on to victory
And sink their bones to Davy Jones, hooray!

Anchors Aweigh, my boys, Anchors Aweigh.
Farewell to college joys, we sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay.
Through our last night on shore, drink to the foam,
Until we meet once more. Here&#x27;s wishing you a happy voyage home.&lt;/poem&gt;

Revised Lyrics of 1997 by then-MCPON John Hagan which is used today by the Navy:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Stand Navy out to sea, fight our battle cry!
We&#x27;ll never change our course so vicious foes steer shy-y-y-y!
Roll out the TNT, anchors aweigh!
Sail on to victory, and sink their bones to Davy Jones, hooray!

Anchors Aweigh, my boys, Anchors Aweigh!
Farewell to foreign Shores, we sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay;
Through our last night ashore, drink to the foam,
Until we meet once more, here&#x27;s wishing you a happy voyage home!

Blue of the mighty deep, Gold of God&#x27;s great sun;
Let these our colors be, Till All of time be done, done, done, done;
On seven seas we learn, Navy&#x27;s stern call:
Faith, courage, service true, With honor over, honor over all.&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Blackadder the Third is the third series of the BBC sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot;, written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, which aired on BBC1 from 17 September to 22 October 1987. The series is set during the Georgian Era, and sees the principal character, Mr. E. Blackadder, serve as butler to the Prince Regent and have to contend with, or cash in on, the fads of the age embraced by his master.

The successor to &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, the series reduced the number of principal characters again compared with the previous series, but instead included a number of significant cameo roles by well-known comic actors. The programme won a BAFTA award for Best Comedy Series in 1988 and received three further nominations.

A fourth and final series, &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;, aired in 1989.

==Plot==
&quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; is vaguely set in the late 18th and early 19th century period known as the Regency, although it is not possible to precisely date any episode as the historical events and persons depicted and referenced are (perhaps intentionally) anachronistic. For example, the formal Regency (during which King George III was incapacitated due to poor mental health and his son, George, Prince of Wales, served as regent) was in place between 1811 and 1820, and the series repeatedly refers to George as &quot;Prince Regent&quot;. However, the second episode depicts Samuel Johnson (who died in 1784) working on his groundbreaking dictionary (which was published in 1755). Likewise, the final episode is set just before the Battle of Trafalgar (1805), but refers to George as Prince Regent, depicts George III as suffering from mental illness, and refers to Arthur Wellesley, who was not created &quot;Viscount Wellington&quot; until 1809, as &quot;Wellington&quot;.

In the series, E. Blackadder Esquire (Rowan Atkinson) is the head butler to the Prince of Wales (Hugh Laurie), who is a spoiled, foppish idiot. Despite Edmund&#x27;s respected intelligence and abilities, he has no personal fortune to speak of. On the other hand, given the ease with which he is able to manipulate the prince, he is generally financially comfortable. According to Edmund he has been serving the Prince Regent all of his life, ever since the prince was breastfed (when he had to show the prince which part of his mother was &quot;serving the drinks&quot;).

Baldrick (Tony Robinson) remains similar to his &quot;Blackadder II&quot; predecessor, and although his &quot;cunning plans&quot; cease to be even remotely intelligent (except in the last episode), he is the most aware of political, religious and social events. As Blackadder himself is now a servant, Baldrick is labelled as Blackadder&#x27;s &quot;dogsbody&quot;. In this series, Baldrick often displays a more belligerent attitude towards his master, even referring to him once as a &quot;lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard&quot; or deliberately comparing his face to his Scottish cousin, MacAdder, who Blackadder openly believes to be ugly. Blackadder often affectionately calls him &quot;Balders&quot; (and Baldrick sometimes calls Blackadder &quot;Mr. B.&quot;).

There are three main sets: the prince&#x27;s quarters, which are opulently decorated; the below-stairs kitchen hangout of Blackadder and Baldrick, which is dark and squalid (though very large and with a very high ceiling); and finally Mrs. Miggins&#x27; coffeehouse. Mrs. Miggins&#x27; pie shop was a never-seen running gag in &quot;Blackadder II&quot;; a descendant of hers is now finally shown, played by Helen Atkinson-Wood.

The plots feature rotten boroughs, Dr. Samuel Johnson (played by Robbie Coltrane), the French Revolution (featuring Chris Barrie as a revolutionary) and the Scarlet Pimpernel, over-the-top theatrical actors, squirrel-hating female highwaymen, the practice of settling quarrels with a duel, and the discussion of tactics with the Duke of Wellington (played by Stephen Fry).

The last episode features Rowan Atkinson as Blackadder&#x27;s Scottish cousin MacAdder, supposedly a fierce swordsman. This leads to a dialogue in which Atkinson is acting both parts. After this episode, Blackadder finds fortune and ends up permanently posing as the Prince Regent after the real prince, disguised as Blackadder, dies after being fatally shot in the chest by the Duke of Wellington.

==Episodes==

The series aired for six episodes broadcast on Thursdays at 9:30 pm on BBC1. The titles of the episodes are always a noun paired with another, derived from an adjective beginning with the same letters, in the manner of the Jane Austen novels, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. On the first broadcast, fifth episode &quot;Amy and Amiability&quot; was billed in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; under its working title of &quot;Cape and Capability&quot;.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Cast==

* Rowan Atkinson as Edmund Blackadder
* Tony Robinson as Baldrick
* Hugh Laurie as George, Prince Regent
* Helen Atkinson-Wood as Mrs Miggins
Although this series reduced the size of the show&#x27;s cast, the programme featured guest appearances in each episode. Tim McInnerny decided not to continue playing the character of Lord Percy for fear of being typecast, although he appeared in a guest role as Lord Topper in episode three. Stephen Fry and Miranda Richardson, who had played major parts in &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, also appeared in guest roles as the Duke of Wellington and a disguised highwayman, respectively. Fry and McInnerny would return as regular performers for the fourth series of &quot;Blackadder&quot;. Other notable guest stars included Denis Lill as Sir Tolbert Buxomley MP, Robbie Coltrane as Dr. Samuel Johnson, and Hugh Paddick and Kenneth Connor as stage actors Keanrick and Mossop, respectively.

==Music and titles==
The opening theme is this time a minuet played on a harpsichord, oboe and cello over close-ups of Blackadder searching a bookcase. The credits and title appear on the books&#x27; spines, and each has a condition and script to match each character, for example Baldrick&#x27;s is plain and in poor condition. Other amusing interspersed titles include &quot;From Black Death to Blackadder&quot;, &quot;The Blackobite Rebellion of 1745&quot;, &quot;The Encyclopædia Blackaddica&quot; and &quot;Landscape Gardening&quot; by Capability Brownadder. Hidden inside a hollow book, he finds a romance novel (complete with cover art) bearing the title of the particular episode. The closing credits are presented in the style of a theatre programme from a Regency-era play, and with an accordion closing theme that samples the melody of the original theme.

==Awards==
The programme won a BAFTA award for Best Comedy Series in 1988. It was also nominated for three more awards; Rowan Atkinson for &quot;Best Light Entertainment Performance&quot;, Antony Thorpe for &quot;Best Design&quot; and Victoria Pocock for &quot;Best Make Up&quot;. The four series of &quot;Blackadder&quot; were voted second in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; in 2004.

==Media releases==
&quot;Blackadder The Third&quot; is available on BBC Worldwide-distributed DVD and VHS video as an individual series or as part of a boxset with the other series of &quot;Blackadder&quot;. A BBC Radio Collection audio version created from the TV soundtrack is available on cassette and CD. All four seasons and the Christmas special are available on iTunes. The complete scripts of the four television series were released in 1998 as &quot;Blackadder: The Whole Damn Dynasty 1485–1917&quot;, and by Penguin Books in 2009.

===VHS releases===

* In February 1989, BBC Enterprises Ltd released all six episodes of &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; on two videos. They were re-released on 7 September 1992 as a double VHS, and on 2 October 1995 as a single video.

<text>The Culgoa River is a river that is part of the Darling catchment within the Murray–Darling basin and is located in South West Queensland.

==Course and features==
The river is a continuation of the western branch of the Balonne River in southern Queensland, near Dirranbandi, and flows generally south-west across parts of the Darling Riverine Plains, joined by ten tributaries, including the Balonne and Birrie rivers, before forming its confluence with the Darling River near Bourke; descending over its course.

Cubbie Station, located on the Culgoa River, is situated adjacent to a large diversion channel which permits the farm, under licence to store of river water. According to downstream farmers in 2008, large cotton farms, such as Cubbie Station, have reduced the traditional flow of the Culgoa River by one third. By 2009, downstream farmers were claiming that due to upstream water entitlements on the Culgoa River, since 2000, the Lower Balonne floodplain had not received enough water to flood the plains. Prior to the granting of these rights, the Lower Balonne River flooded every two or three years; impacting the sustainability of flora, fauna, birdlife, and economic returns from grazing livestock and cropping.

Little Culgoa Creek, an anabranch of the Culgoa River, leaves the river near Goodooga and returns to the river near Brenda Gate. The river flows through the Culgoa Floodplain National Park and the Culgoa National Park, located respectively north and south of the border between Queensland and New South Wales, west of Goodooga.

==Etymology==
Culgoa is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;running through&quot; or &quot;returning&quot;.

<doc id="438541" wikidata="Q533231" url="?curid=438541" title="Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie">
<text>Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth studio album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998. 

Inspired from her trip to India over late 1996 and early 1997, the album cover contains phrases from five precepts, a basic code of ethics of the followers of Buddhism.

The first single from the album, &quot;Thank U&quot;, reached the top 20 of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Morissette promoted the album with worldwide touring. The album gets its name from a lyric in the track &quot;So Pure&quot;.

Morissette expanded her musical palette on this album with world sounds from Middle-Eastern spiritual music to trip-hop, moving away from the straightforward post-grunge of her previous work. She experimented with more complex and unconventional songwriting, including stream of consciousness, often deviating from traditional verse-chorus structures. This approach resulted in a richer, more textured sound that incorporated new musical ideas while still maintaining her characteristic vocal style and introspective lyrics. 

The album was positively received by critics and performed well commercially, breaking the record for album sales in its first week by a female artist. It won the 2000 Juno Award for Album of the Year. 

==Background==
Morissette wrote &quot;Thank U&quot; and &quot;Baba&quot; after her trip to India in 1997. The protagonist of &quot;Baba&quot; goes on a spiritual pilgrimage to India where she encounters a guru who, like many spiritual teachers in India, is referred to as &quot;Baba&quot;. The word &quot;Baba&quot; means &quot;father&quot; in the Hindi language. Morissette opened most of shows during the &quot;Junkie&quot; era with the song, and it was featured as an opener during her 2002 tours. It has been seldom played since then. &quot;Baba&quot; opened Morissette&#x27;s performance on the television show &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; in 1999, but it was excluded from the CD release &quot;Alanis Unplugged&quot;. Another live version of &quot;Baba&quot; was released on the &quot;No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees&quot; CD. 

In a 2012 interview with fans, director Kevin Smith confirmed that &quot;Front Row&quot; was partially inspired by a phone conversation he and Morissette once had. They were mutually attracted to each other but never actually dated. His suggestion of naming the reasons they were not a couple became part of the lyrics.

==Promotion==
As with her previous album, Morissette did an extensive amount of touring in-support of this one. In the fall of 1998, she embarked on a club tour across North America, with select appearances in Europe, Asia and Australia. The North American leg of the tour included opening act Chris Whitley.

Guitarist Nick Lashley and bassist Chris Chaney remained for this album&#x27;s touring from the previous years, although there were several new band members. The band now incorporated a keyboardist, Deron Johnson, and welcomed guitarist Joel Shearer (from the &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; recording sessions) and drummer Gary Novak. Morissette herself continued playing guitar (more than on previous tours), as well as her signature harmonica. She also started playing the flute live, during the song &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot;.

In January 1999, the &quot;Junkie Tour&quot; kicked-off, lasting through July, then returned from October through December. Opening acts included Garbage and Liz Phair, among others. The worldwide tour had alternating setlists for every leg, but included the usual set openers and closers. The concert introduction music was a track from DJ Shadow, entitled &quot;Building Steam with a Grain of Salt&quot;.

During the tour, Morissette wrote the song &quot;Still&quot; for the Kevin Smith film, &quot;Dogma&quot;. This song was performed live for the first time in July at Morissette&#x27;s &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; special. After that special, she performed in front of thousands during the Woodstock &#x27;99 concert festival in New York. Unlike the previous tours, Morissette focused mainly on performing songs that had been released and didn&#x27;t perform any new songs, aside from a couple of B-sides during the second half of the year.

In May, Morissette and Tori Amos announced the &quot;5 Week Tour&quot; which filled the touring void in August and September before &quot;The Junkie Tour&quot; re-commenced. The tour would be a joint venture, as they both co-headlined the bills. Toward the end of the tour, Morissette recorded her &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; concert special. During the final weeks of &quot;The Junkie Tour&quot;, keyboardist Deron Johnson left the band and was replaced, and Gary Novak took a temporary leave and was replaced as well.

Morissette announced a summer 2000 mini-tour, called &quot;The One Tour&quot;, which saw her enlisting a different fan in each city as her own ‘local ambassador’, to guide her during the daytime and show her the best that the region has to offer (food, history, culture, music, language, and more). These local guides were selected after having won Z.com’s online contest. &quot;The One Tour&quot; kicked-off on July 7, 2000 with a rare performance in Beirut, Lebanon, before continuing on to Europe, stopping in countries and cities she had never (or rarely) performed in, namely Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Switzerland. This was followed by shows in Tel Aviv and Caesarea, Israel, and a final stop on July 22nd in Istanbul.

On August 17, 2000, Morissette gave a special performance in Los Angeles at the Museum of Tolerance. Two months later, in October, she participated in a televised special from the Navajo Nation in Arizona. This was filmed as the premiere episode of a series on MSN and DirecTV, called &quot;Music in High Places&quot;; in addition to acoustic performances, Morissette learned about key moments in Navajo history, as well as Navajo cultural practices, traditions and music. She also explored the local wilderness and went into nature, studying, meditating and reflecting with elders and spiritual leaders.

The Navajo Nation special was Morissette&#x27;s final date of the year, and her final promotion connected to &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;, before she started work on her follow-up record, &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot;.

In November 2023, Morissette also announced &quot;The Triple Moon Tour&quot; with 33 live dates in the United States for the summer 2024 with the Joan Jett and the Blackhearts as support act, commemorating 25th anniversary of the album. However, aside from the traditional &quot;Thank U&quot; number, she performed only &quot;Heart of the House&quot; as full performance, the other few songs were performed as segues.

==Singles==
The first single from &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;, &quot;Thank U&quot;, was released to US radio in October 1998. It charted considerably high in initial airplay because of the anticipation for the album, but many critics and listeners who had pigeonholed Morissette as an angry woman were surprised by the song&#x27;s calm and serene feel. Released in November, the album debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with the highest first-week sales for a female artist at the time, selling 469,054 copies in its first seven days. She held this record for two years, until being outsold in first week sales by Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; which sold 1.3 million copies in 2000. It held the number-one spot for an additional week, before falling to eighth place in what is generally a busy shopping period because of the holiday season. Over the next few weeks sales for the album slowly declined, and then faltered drastically. After 28 weeks, the album had fallen off the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and as of September 2008 it had sold 2.6 million copies in the US, less than a fifth in sales of that of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;.

Though not an official single release in the US, &quot;Joining You&quot; became a modest hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart; it was released as the album&#x27;s second single in the UK and Europe. &quot;Unsent&quot;, the second US single, peaked outside the top 40 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The third single &quot;So Pure&quot; made the top 40 in the UK as well as certain airplay charts in the US, though not the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. None of the singles revived significant interest in the album.

==Unreleased songs==
===B-sides and unreleases===
There had been many songs performed live during the tour in support of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, and during festivals in between albums that did not appear on the album. It was never specified if those songs were supposed to be included or not, but one of the songs did make its way through, &quot;Can&#x27;t Not&quot; which was first performed live on January 12, 1996, along with &quot;King of Intimidation&quot; &amp; &quot;No Pressure Over Cappuccino&quot;. This version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Not&quot;, however, was slightly more mellow—and differed from the demo version previewed on the home video, &quot;Jagged Little Pill, Live&quot;. The song &quot;King of Intimidation&quot; (also previewed on the video) was never released on any album until the &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; 2015 deluxe edition, but appeared in a live clip along with the original &quot;Can&#x27;t Not&quot; live clip on 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Collection&quot; DVD.

&quot;No Pressure Over Cappuccino&quot; was another song that popped up from the previous tours, but not until 1999&#x27;s live album, &quot;Alanis Unplugged&quot;. This song was previewed on the above-mentioned video, but only in acoustic form. That version is mistakenly believed to be a studio demo, but it is merely an acoustic version performed with the band. The final song previewed on &quot;Jagged Little Pill, Live&quot; is &quot;Death of Cinderella&quot;; Alanis debuted the song live on December 6, 1995. It had never been released until the &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; 2015 deluxe edition. Other songs include &quot;Gorgeous&quot;, &quot;London&quot;, &quot;Pray for Peace&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;She Gave Me a Wink&quot;) which has never been released but she played it for the first time in concert on October 18, 1997, and two untitled songs that fans refer to as &quot;The Weekend Song&quot; (or &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;) which debuted in concert on February 4, 1996, and &quot;After A Year Like This One&quot; on July 12, 1996. A live version of &quot;London&quot; appeared as a B-side to the &quot;Joining You&quot; and &quot;Unsent&quot; singles. The studio version was later released on the &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; 2015 deluxe edition with &quot;Gorgeous&quot; as well. Both songs debuted in concert on June 8, 1997.

Aside from the songs written and performed during concerts 1995–1997, there were songs specifically written for &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;. &quot;Pollyanna Flower&quot; was released as a B-side to &quot;Thank U&quot;, while &quot;These Are The Thoughts&quot; appeared on the single to &quot;Joining You&quot; (and later on &quot;Alanis Unplugged&quot;). &quot;Can&#x27;t Not&quot; was originally intended to be a B-side, but Morissette and Ballard decided to put it on the record. Another song left off the album was &quot;Princes Familiar&quot;, whose studio version has yet to surface. It has only been released in live, acoustic form on both &quot;Alanis Unplugged&quot; and &quot;The Collection.&quot;

===Demo versions===
Over the past several years, demos of songs have leaked online. These demos include:

# &quot;Thank U&quot; (with additional verses and lyrics, as well as a more upbeat drum track).
# &quot;Unsent&quot; (not available in high quality, but features two extra verses, and different names).
# &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; (including Morissette clearing her throat in the beginning, a slight lyric change in one of the verses and a slightly longer flute solo).
# &quot;Can&#x27;t Not&quot; (30 second clip)
# &quot;Uninvited&quot; (just vocals and piano, officially released on the &quot;Thank U&quot; single and the Japanese and Australian releases).
# &quot;These Are the Thoughts&quot; (features backing vocals and lyric changes, officially released on the &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; Deluxe edition release).

==Critical reception==
&quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; was acclaimed by music critics. 

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called it a &quot;clear step forward&quot; and concluded that &quot;Morissette is a weird acquired taste, due to her idiosyncratic vocals and doggedly convoluted confessionals – but [the album] certainly confirms that she doesn&#x27;t quite sound like anyone else, either.&quot; 

&quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau commented that he felt &quot;privileged to listen along with all the young women whose struggles Morissette blows up to such a scale.&quot; 

Ken Tucker from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; complimented Morissette&#x27;s new style and wrote that &quot;Morissette has used her year-plus recording hiatus and newfound star status wisely, in pursuit of a way to make a vulnerable, openhearted album in the face of intense commercial expectations.&quot; 

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot; critic Sal Cinquemani complimented Morissette&#x27;s songwriting and concluded that while the album &quot;is nearly 15 minutes too long (did an ode to her mother, the sweet &#x27;Heart of the House,&#x27; really need to be made public?)... not one moment of &quot;Junkie&quot;″s 70-plus minutes is less than captivating.&quot;

Despite the B+ grade from Ken Tucker in 1998, fellow &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; music critic David Browne was much harsher. In the Spring 2000 Tenth Anniversary issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, in a retrospective article discussing popular music in the 1990s, Browne wrote &quot;Musically speaking, easy targets abounded--does anyone beyond family remember Hammer&#x27;s gangsta makeover or Vanilla Ice&#x27;s live album? At least we could laugh at those, whereas the decade&#x27;s foremost clunker--Alanis Morisette&#x27;s &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;--was corporate grunge and victim-culture whining incarnate&quot;. It was also listed amongst &quot;the worst albums ever&quot; by &quot;Q&quot; magazine.

==Commercial performance==
In the United States, &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 469,000 copies sold in its first week. The album broke the record for sales in its first week by a female act, surpassing Lauryn Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; which opened with 423,000 copies. This would be later surpassed in 2000 by Britney Spears with the release of her second album &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; selling 1.3 million copies in its first week. In the New Zealand Albums Chart, it was Morissette&#x27;s second consecutive number one album, and was certificated 2× Platinum by RIANZ, selling over 30,000 copies. The album also debuted at number one in Switzerland, and stayed in the charts for thirty-one weeks. It was certified Platinum in that country. The album entered at number one in Norway, staying there for three weeks. It was certificated platinum there as well. It also peaked in the top ten in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Sweden, and other European countries. The album has sold 2,604,000 copies in the United States as of March 2012.
The album sold 2.2 million copies worldwide on its first week of release and over 5.2 million copies worldwide within a month.

==Accolades==
&quot;Thank U&quot; received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and &quot;So Pure&quot; was nominated in the category of Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.

The album itself won a Juno Award for Album of the Year. The third single So Pure won the award for Best Video.

<doc id="438546" wikidata="Q1463310" url="?curid=438546" title="Under Rug Swept">
<text>Under Rug Swept is the fifth studio album and third internationally released album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Released by Maverick Records in the United States on February 26, 2002, and in the United Kingdom a day earlier (see 2002 in music), it was the first album Morissette had written and produced all on her own. It debuted at number one on charts in 12 countries, including the United States and Canada, and produced the singles &quot;Hands Clean&quot; and &quot;Precious Illusions&quot;. Sales, however, did not match those of Morissette&#x27;s previous two studio albums. 

The album gets its name from a lyric in the lead single &quot;Hands Clean&quot;.

==Background and production==
Before recording of the album began, when she had not written songs or journal entries for nine months, Morissette went to Toronto not knowing whether she was going to write songs herself or with someone else. In the first week of her stay she had written seven songs alone, and she described the writing process as &quot;really fast and accelerated&quot;. As on her previous albums, Morissette took a stream-of-consciousness approach to the songwriting. She wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, spending around twenty minutes or less on each song, and recorded the vocals during the writing process, in one or two takes. &quot;I really wanted to make sure that I wrote in the studio so that, while I was writing, I could be singing it at the same time&quot;, she said. According to Morissette, she had a &quot;little space station&quot; with a keyboard, an acoustic guitar, an electric guitar, her journal and a microphone set up, and everything was recorded onto DAT. Morissette had not planned to produce an album on her own, saying &quot;It was just a matter of when it would happen organically&quot;. She &quot;kept things from becoming overwhelming&quot; by refraining from cross-connecting her producing, songwriting and performing duties.

Production of the album was delayed when Morissette became involved in disputes with executives at Maverick Records after she testified at U.S. Government hearings against artist-unfriendly record contract practices. As she put it, she had to go through lawyers to &quot;have a dialogue with people&quot; and take an extended period of time to &quot;have one little thing figured out&quot;. Because she was accustomed to having the producers on her albums act as &quot;the buffer to the outside world&quot; during recording, she found it a challenge to handle the situation on her own. &quot;I was trying to be isolated enough to tap into my artistry while keeping people at bay who don&#x27;t know fuck all about nurturance&quot;, she said. Eventually, it became &quot;too much&quot; for Morissette and she took negotiations into her own hands, which meant she had to halt her work on the album: &quot;I had to be willing to throw the record away and not ever release it.&quot;

Despite the relatively low sales of Morissette&#x27;s previous two albums, &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; (1998) and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (1999), compared to those of her international debut album, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995), Maverick Records considered her a strong commercial asset and were concerned that she would leave because of the disputes and release the album on another label. For a time Morissette was threatening to leave Maverick (according to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;), until label founder Madonna intervened and persuaded her to stay. During the delay, Morissette brought in musicians such as bassists Eric Avery (formerly of Jane&#x27;s Addiction) and Flea (of Red Hot Chili Peppers), Dean DeLeo (guitarist for Stone Temple Pilots) and Me&#x27;shell Ndegeocello to play on the album. After this period, in response to the September 11 attacks, she previewed the track &quot;Utopia&quot; that she wrote in January 2002 on her website.

During the making of the album, Morissette wrote 27 songs, which she eventually narrowed down to 17. When she was mixing and producing the album, every time she reached the 11th track she, as she put it, &quot;would shut down. My brain would shut off and I just felt like it was information overload ... I didn&#x27;t want to overwhelm myself or anyone else in the process of trying to cram them all onto the double CD.&quot; She planned for several of the excluded songs to be released as single B-sides or on a separate EP to be released after the album; eight of them were released on a CD/DVD package, &quot;Feast on Scraps&quot;, released in late 2002. &quot;I just could not face the idea of letting all of these songs go&quot;, she had said. &quot;They&#x27;re all precious to me. It&#x27;s just a matter of finding the right framework in which to share them with the world.&quot;

==Themes==
Morissette has said that during the writing and recording of the album, she noticed a unifying theme emerging of &quot;the desire to mend unions and bridge gaps. Whether it be between genders or between human beings, between spirits.&quot; She said that when she began working on the album, she was at &quot;the middle of the beginning of the end of a relationship&quot;, and that entering the studio and writing new material &quot;would propel me to face some of the truths that were scaring me. Inevitably, we ended up breaking up, so the record kind of followed the grieving of it, then the proverbial phoenix rising and continuing to grow.&quot; &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; was also influenced by the extensive travelling Morissette did between recording sessions, particularly her stay at a Navajo reservation: &quot;The sense of community the Navajo people really focus on, there&#x27;s a similar sense of community I felt when I traveled, when we toured through the Middle East&quot;, she explained. &quot;It permeates what I yearn for and I try to create it as best as I can through the songs&quot;. She described the album as melodically and sonically &quot;more structured&quot; than her previous album, &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; (1998).

The first track, &quot;21 Things I Want in a Lover&quot;, features Morissette listing the qualities she looks for in a partner. &quot;There&#x27;s a part of this song where I&#x27;m joking, but there&#x27;s a whole part of this song where I&#x27;m dead serious&quot;, she said. &quot;Because the palm sweating, heart palpitating beginnings of a relationship often result in a huge amount of incompatibility, so the concept of compatibility is so much more important to me as I get older.&quot; &quot;Narcissus&quot; describes, as Morissette puts it, &quot;that dichotomy of loving someone and really wanting it to work and wanting to bridge the gap and bridge the chasm and, yet at the same time, being totally repulsed by the qualities that are being presented and the pain that comes from it.&quot; She said the intention of writing &quot;Hands Clean&quot; was &quot;to get to a place where I could be as truthful and as honest as I possibly could be about certain relationships in my past ... oftentimes I feel by not speaking the truth, by being silent, there&#x27;s an element of an untruth in that ... [it] sometimes can feel just as horrible as a lie to me.&quot;

&quot;Flinch&quot;, the fourth track, was written about an experience Morissette had during which she almost ran into a man who had a profound effect on her: &quot;I was surprised at how many years had passed but still I was responding to the situation as though I had been spending time with him two minutes earlier ... I do believe that I will be able to get to a point where hearing his name or even running into him or hearing from him won&#x27;t trigger me as much as it did and still does.&quot; With &quot;So Unsexy&quot;, Morissette said she was &quot;really trying to get into the underbelly of some of my insecurities and why little tiny things that are innocuous and inconsequential are translated in my own mind as to be taken so personally ... as long as I have my own back, it&#x27;s not as scary and it&#x27;s not as horrifying.&quot; In &quot;Precious Illusions&quot; she discusses &quot;the difference between really being alive and really embracing the reason why I&#x27;m here on this earth versus my just being asleep and sleep walking and accepting the status quo and accepting somewhat of a suffering mentality to being here. It really is my responsibility to distinguish the difference between the two and choose which one I want.&quot;

Track seven on the album, &quot;That Particular Time&quot;, documents a breakup and &quot;the three distinct chapters in the relationship&quot; Morissette was going through. &quot;[Love] took many different forms, and I was beating myself up for a long time for being in a relationship that just didn&#x27;t feel right&quot;, she said. &quot;But then I realized that it was a very loving act for me to stick it out for a minute or two to really kind of see whether there was something worth continuing to explore in a romantic way. A Man, which is written from a male point of view as a response to &quot;Narcissus&quot;, &quot;For once I try to feel a bit of empathy and to imagine how it feels being a man in these confusing times ... I try to react as an honourable man to the vibes of erroneous machos who are damaging the image of my sex. &quot;You Owe Me Nothing in Return&quot; is, in Morissette&#x27;s words, &quot;about the real definition of what love is ... wanting for someone that you love what they want for themselves. And at the same time not sacrificing my own life and my thoughts and my own beliefs. Supporting someone in their choices and at the same time being able to express what mine are, even if they differ, is the ultimate healthy, loving interaction.&quot;

The tenth and penultimate track, &quot;Surrendering&quot;, was the last song Morissette wrote for the album. According to her, it is &quot;about the gratitude that I feel for someone tapping into the courage that it takes to allow themselves to be loved and to drop the defenses and fears ... And how thrilling it is for me to be able to be let in that kind of way ... It&#x27;s a very peaceful, joyful song&quot;. Morissette considers &quot;Utopia&quot; a summary of the feminine and masculine elements in the relationship chronicled in the album: &quot;For me, it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re sitting together in the same car and are finally driving down the same road in the same direction and there&#x27;s a meeting of both worlds.&quot; She said that when she wrote it, she knew it would be the last track.

Morissette wrote several political songs such as &quot;Awakening Americans&quot; and &quot;Symptoms&quot; during the making of the album, but she decided not to include such material in spite of an online petition lobbying for their release. Morissette said she doesn&#x27;t &quot;resonate&quot; with overtly political songs because they are &quot;removed too much&quot; from her personal experiences: &quot;I love sitting up at two in the morning talking religion, but when it comes to my songs, it&#x27;s just rambling, soapbox, obnoxious&quot;, she said. &quot;Awakening Americans&quot; and &quot;Symptoms&quot; were eventually released as B-sides.

==Promotion==
&quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; was closely guarded before its release: for journalists to listen to it, they had to be invited to Maverick Records headquarters and listen to a single play copy in a special listening room. In July 2001 Geoff Mayfield of &quot;Billboard&quot; was quoted as saying that because of the popularity of artists such as Radiohead and Staind, it was a &quot;good year for rock ... It&#x27;s not just one kind of rock that&#x27;s connecting right now — the palette is varied. For an artist [such as Morissette] who comes from rock, this could be a fertile time.&quot; Other industry insiders said it may become a commercial return to form for Morissette; &quot;The Record&quot; noted Morissette&#x27;s age- and gender-transcendent appeal, the &quot;smart&quot; lyrics on the album and the appropriateness of its &quot;soulful introspection and spiritual awareness&quot; in a post-9/11 society, and how Morissette &quot;stands out from everyone else on radio ... there are few artists addressing relationships in a serious way, especially from a female point of view.&quot;

&quot;Hands Clean&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, began receiving radio airplay in the United States on January 8, 2002, and it debuted at number one in Canada following its physical release while also reaching number one in New Zealand. It peaked inside the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US, where it was most successful at Adult Top 40 and Hot AC radio; in one week more Hot AC stations added the single to their playlists than any other song in history. It was considered a comeback single for Morissette, and it was her most successful single since 1998 in most countries, reaching the top ten in Australia and the top 20 in the United Kingdom. For February, the album&#x27;s month of release, Morissette was &quot;Artist of the Month&quot; on AOL Music and also performed at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.

==Critical reception==
Reviews of &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; on its release were generally positive. &quot;Billboard&quot; described the album as &quot;supreme&quot; and &quot;very human ... [it] satisfies with moments of darkness, enlightenment, anger, bittersweet tension, and happiness ... Although 2002 is still young, consider &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; one of the year&#x27;s best.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; magazine said the album was &quot;a smart shot across the bows ... some of the most inviting music of her career ... Morissette has fashioned a lyrical Trojan Horse to be wheeled into unsuspecting homes for months to come.&quot; Robert Christgau wrote, &quot;The pop-rock here lacks the faux-punk edge [on &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;] ... But Morissette instantly demonstrates her gift for the catchy ... topping memorable verse with indelible chorus, she&#x27;s a self-actualized nut who goes for what she wants, exactly as pretentious as the college girls she represents for.&quot; According to &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, the album &quot;is Alanis Morissette in top form, exercising her God-given right to vent and sound beautiful doing so.&quot;

Other critical appraisals were less favorable. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in a three-star review, wrote &quot;The music is brawny and meticulous ... [but] &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; just about drowns in psychobabble. While the tone of the songs, and the grain of Morissette&#x27;s voice, promise intimacy, there&#x27;s hardly a private detail anywhere.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said &quot;the album&#x27;s garbled title is also preparation for some of the clumsiest lyrics to be heard on a pop record in years ... The songs are riddled with such overwritten Psych 101 ruminations.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; criticised the lyrics, saying &quot;Much like even non-football fans used to be mesmerized by [Howard] Cosell&#x27;s genius for never using two words when 23 would do, you don&#x27;t have to be a love-damaged 17-year-old girl to find &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot;&#x27;s dense verbiage a trip. Words tumble forth and arrange themselves kaleidoscopically into all sorts of unusual categories ... I&#x27;m just not sure that pop music should come out of a thesaurus.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;a tedious album&quot; with &quot;overwrought folk-rock like &#x27;Surrendering&#x27; and &#x27;Hands Clean&#x27; destined for a thousand organic juice bars. Lyrically, it&#x27;s often hilarious ... This record moves way beyond armchair psychology — in fact, there are armchairs that have a cannier grasp of the mind.&quot;

&quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; received a Juno Award nomination in the category of Pop Album of the Year. Morissette herself won the Jack Richardson Producer of the Year award for the songs &quot;Hands Clean&quot; and &quot;So Unsexy&quot;, and she was nominated in the Artist of the Year category. (For more information, see Juno Awards of 2003.)

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; entered the Canadian albums chart at number one with first week sales of 35,000 copies, and the CRIA certified it platinum the following month for shipments of 100,000. In the US the album sold 215,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart during a busy sales week following the 2002 Grammy Awards ceremony; it stayed in the top spot for a week. Within a month of release it had sold 500,000 copies, and the RIAA certified it platinum for shipments of over one million. &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; debuted at number one in 12 countries, including Germany, Japan, and Australia. It debuted at number two in France and the United Kingdom, where the BPI certified it gold for shipping 100,000 copies.

The album stayed in the top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for five weeks and on the chart for 24. A second single, &quot;Precious Illusions&quot;, was released on May 20, 2002, and reached number four in Canada, but it failed to chart on the US Hot 100 or inside the top 40 in Australia or the UK. Later in 2002, Morissette embarked on a world tour, which did not pick up album sales. In August she performed at the V2002 festival in England. After the failure of &quot;Precious Illusions&quot;, Maverick did not commercially release any more singles from the album, although &quot;So Unsexy&quot; was tentatively slated as the third single at one point. Promotional singles were issued internationally: &quot;Flinch&quot; and &quot;So Unsexy&quot; in Brazil, &quot;21 Things I Want in a Lover&quot; in Latin America, &quot;Surrendering&quot; in Canada, and &quot;Utopia&quot; in the US.

As of March 2012, &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; has sold 1,020,000 copies in the US, less than half the amount sold by &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; by the same date. According to a Maverick Records press release, &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; had sold 3.8 million copies worldwide by February 2004.

<doc id="438547" wikidata="Q4922517" url="?curid=438547" title="Blackadder's Christmas Carol">
<text>Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol, a one-off episode of &quot;Blackadder&quot;, is a parody of Charles Dickens&#x27; 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. It is set between &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; (1987) and &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; (1989), and is narrated by Hugh Laurie. Produced by the BBC, it was first broadcast on BBC1 on 23 December 1988.
==Plot==
Ebenezer Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), the Victorian proprietor of a &quot;moustache shop&quot;, is the nicest man in England. He is everything that Ebenezer Scrooge was by the end of the original story: generous and kind to everybody, and sensitive to the misery of others. As a result, people take advantage of his kindness – Mrs. Scratchit and a young boy take all his money, his god-daughter Millicent takes his presents and Christmas tree, and a beadle takes his food. All but Mr. Baldrick (Tony Robinson) view him as a victim. His business turns no profit, all his earnings go to charity and con artists, and despite his positive attitude, he lives a lonely, miserable life.

One Christmas Eve, Blackadder&#x27;s destiny changes when the Spirit of Christmas (Robbie Coltrane) visits him to congratulate him for his ways. The Spirit lets him see two shades of the past: his Blackadder ancestors (the protagonists of &quot;Blackadder II&quot; and &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;). Instead of providing positive reinforcement that Ebenezer is better than his forefathers, these visions lead him to admire them and their wit. He asks the Spirit to show him what could happen if he became like them. He sees a vision of a distant future where his descendant, Grand Admiral Blackadder, is a successful and ruthless official of a galactic empire, about to marry the similarly ruthless and insanely ambitious Queen Asphyxia XIX (Miranda Richardson) after murdering her &quot;triple husbandoid&quot; (Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry and Patsy Byrne). The future Baldrick, wearing a loincloth, is Blackadder&#x27;s slave. Blackadder asks the Spirit what will happen if he stays as he is. He is shown an alternative future in which his descendant is the loincloth-clad slave of the incompetent Admiral Baldrick.

Contrary to the Spirit&#x27;s intended point, Blackadder takes &quot;the very clear lesson that bad guys have all the fun&quot;. On Christmas morning, he wakes up a different man: bitter, vengeful, greedy, and insulting to everyone he meets, including Baldrick. Now feeling in control of his life, he misses an opportunity when he insults two strangers who claim to be Queen Victoria (Miriam Margolyes) and Prince Albert (Jim Broadbent) and throws them out of his home. The episode ends on Blackadder&#x27;s extravagant Christmas dinner, which is ruined when Baldrick shows him the royal seal left behind by the strangers, proving Baldrick&#x27;s story that the Queen and Prince Albert had planned to award Blackadder a gift of £50,000 and the title of Baron Blackadder for being the &quot;nicest man in England&quot;.

=== Edited version ===
Most versions of this special edit an early scene when Baldrick discusses a dog used as Jesus for the Nativity play, removing one line in which Baldrick says the dog would be nailed to a cross for a repeat Easter performance. The earliest known case of this edit was on its first rerun in December 1989. The same version was used for later terrestrial broadcasts when the special aired at Christmas in the years 1998, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The edited version is also seen in the &quot;Blackadder Ultimate Edition&quot; DVD set and on the UK channel Gold since 2018 (the uncut version was screened until 2017). The original uncut version can be seen on the Region 1 U.S. DVD set.

<text>HMAS &quot;Curlew&quot; (M 1121) was a operated by the Royal Navy (as HMS &quot;Chediston&quot;) from 1953 to 1961, and the Royal Australian Navy from 1962 to 1991. During her Australian service, the ship operated off Malaysia during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation during the mid-1960s, then was modified for use as a minehunter. Delays in bringing a replacement class into service kept &quot;Curlew&quot; operational until 1990, and she was sold into civilian service in 1991.

==Construction==
The minesweeper was built by the Montrose Shipyard in Scotland, launched on 6 October 1953, and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 28 September 1954 as HMS &quot;Chediston&quot;.

==Operational history==

===Royal Navy===
Between August 1955 and October 1957, the ship was attached to Tay Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After October 1957, the ship was placed in storage.

===Royal Australian Navy===
The ship was one of six sold to the Royal Australian Navy for A£5.5 million in 1961. &quot;Chediston&quot; was modified for tropical conditions, and commissioned on 12 August 1962 as HMAS &quot;Curlew&quot;.

During the mid-1960s, &quot;Curlew&quot; was one of several ships operating in support of the Malaysian government during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. This service was later recognised with the battle honour &quot;Malaysia 1964–66&quot;.

In the late 1960s, &quot;Curlew&quot; and sister ship were modified for use as minehunters.

Divers from &quot;Curlew&quot; inspected the wreck of .

==Decommissioning and fate==
The delay in bringing the Bay class minehunters into service kept &quot;Curlew&quot; operational until 1990. &quot;Curlew&quot; paid off on 30 April 1990 and was sold on 17 June 1991. In the late 1990s she appeared in the movies Paradise Road and The Thin Red Line.

As of mid-2003, &quot;Curlew&quot; was operating out of Port Huon, Tasmania as a fishing vessel. The ship was later used for accommodation at Port Huon.

In April 2018 she was purchased for $1. Her new owner intends to use the ship as a floating backpacker hostel in Brisbane.

<doc id="438557" wikidata="Q5630315" url="?curid=438557" title="HMAS Deloraine">
<text>HMAS &quot;Deloraine&quot; (J232/M232), named for the town of Deloraine, Tasmania, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). In January 1942 she evaded an attack by the Japanese submarine &quot;I-124&quot; north-west of Darwin and was jointly credited with the submarine&#x27;s sinking after inflicting the initial damage. She was present at the bombing of Darwin and survived unscathed.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Deloraine&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.
&quot;Deloraine&quot; was laid down at Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co in Balmain, New South Wales on 19 March 1941. She was launched on 26 July 1941 by Dame Mary Hughes, wife of the Minister for the Navy, and commissioned into the RAN on 22 November 1941.

==Operational history==

===World War II===
After commissioning, &quot;Deloraine&quot; sailed to Darwin, where she was based for the first part of her career as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol vessel. On 20 January 1942, the United States destroyer USS &quot;Edsall&quot;, escorting the American oiler USS Trinity (AO-13), reported a Japanese submarine was in the area after an unsuccessful attack on the oiler. The submarine, I-124 of the Imperial Japanese Navy, tried and failed to torpedo &quot;Deloraine&quot; at 1:35 pm, with &quot;Deloraine&quot; locating the submarine on asdic. After two depth-charge attacks the submarine briefly broke the surface. Deloraine then observed &#x27;large bubbles of oil and air&#x27;. Sister ships &quot;Katoomba&quot; and &quot;Lithgow&quot; arrived in the area; the two ships continuing to patrol and depth-charge the area while &quot;Deloraine&quot; reloaded. They were successful, and the four ships were jointly credited with the kill of &quot;I-124&quot;—the first enemy submarine to be sunk in Australian waters, going down with 80 lives.
The ship was present in Darwin Harbour during the Japanese bombing of Darwin in February 1942. She was undamaged by the attack and assisted in rescue and recovery operations. On 5 March, &quot;Deloraine&quot; was attacked on several occasions by a Japanese flying boat, but was again undamaged.

In July 1942, the corvette returned to Sydney, and spent the next twenty months escorting supply convoys from Sydney to Newcastle, Brisbane, and New Guinea. In April 1943, &quot;Deloraine&quot; rescued 19 survivors from the torpedoed merchant ship &quot;Lydia M. Child&quot;. On 16 June 1943, &quot;Portmar&quot; and &quot;LST-469&quot; were torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine while travelling in Convoy GP55: the only two ships lost in the convoys &quot;Deloraine&quot; was attached to during her service history.

In May 1944, &quot;Deloraine&quot; was redeployed to New Guinea waters for escort, patrol, and troop transport duties. She carried out bombardments in support of several Allied landings in New Guinea. At the end of April 1945, the corvette sailed to Brisbane for refits: hostilities ended while she was in dock.

The corvette was awarded three battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Darwin 1942&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot;, and &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;.

===Post-war===
After refitting, &quot;Deloraine&quot; was used to transport an occupation force from Morotai to Menado, then returned to Sydney and commenced clearing minefields off the New South Wales coast. For the first half of 1946, &quot;Deloraine&quot; was assigned to New Britain, again clearing minefields. She was paid off into reserve on 4 November 1945, but was recommissioned on 16 December, and recommenced minesweeping duties along the Australian coast.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Deloraine&quot; was paid off into reserve at Fremantle, Western Australia on 30 June 1948. She was sold for scrap to the Hong Kong Delta Shipping Company on 8 August 1956.

<text>The Diamantina River is a major river in Central West Queensland and the far north of South Australia.

The river was named by William Landsborough in 1866 for Lady Diamantina Bowen (née Roma), wife of Sir George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland. It has three major tributaries the Western River, Mayne River and Farrars Creek.

==Geography==
Rising north-west of in the Swords Range in Queensland, the river flows in a south-westerly direction through central Queensland and the Channel Country to form the Warburton River at its confluence with the Georgina River. In extremely wet years, the Warburton River flows as far as Lake Eyre. The length of the Diamantina River is approximately , and the basin is approximately , of which are used for agriculture.

Most of the basin of the Diamantina is very flat—even the highest points in the northeast do not reach above sea level and Lake Eyre itself is below sea level. Apart from a few streams near Winton (the largest town in the basin) almost all rivers in the basin flow southwestwards towards Birdsville. The Diamantina River has no main channel, rather it is a series of wide and relatively shallow channels. The major feature of the river&#x27;s sluggish course is Diamantina National Park about halfway between Winton and Birdsville. Apart from the national park, almost all land in the basin is used for grazing cattle and sheep, though numbers fluctuate greatly and considerable skill is required on the part of graziers.

The variable drought and flood cycles of the area make the river ephemeral with many semi-permanent waterholes. The highest recorded flow rate of the river was at Birdsville in 1974 with was measured.

The Diamantina runs along the northern and eastern rim of a roughly circular zone measuring some 130 km across that has been identified by Geoscience Australia as a crustal anomaly. Proof is currently lacking as to the cause, but it is believed likely that the anomaly was caused by an asteroid strike that happened about 300 million years ago.

==Environment==

===Climate===
The climate of the basin is hot and arid. In January, temperatures throughout the basin average around during the day and decline only to about at night. In winter, they typically range from during the day to at night. On occasions, however, frost has been reported in all areas of the basin: Winton has recorded minima as low as .

====Precipitation====
Rainfall is heavily concentrated between December and March: averages for these four months range from at Winton and Kynuna to around at Birdsville. In the rest of the year rainfall is very scanty and only on the rarest occasions are significant falls reported: throughout most of the basin the average rainfall between May and September totals around . However, the rainfall of the basin, as with all of the Lake Eyre Basin, is exceedingly erratic and catastrophic droughts and floods tend to be the normal state of affairs throughout this region. In the northern part of the basin, annual rainfalls as high as were reported in 1894, 1950, 1974 and 2000, whilst even in Birdsville annual totals as high as have been reported. During floods the river can be as wide as across.

In dry years such as 1902, 1905, 1928, 1961, 1965 and 2002, almost the whole basin reported totals . There can also be significant variation from station to station over small areas: although the annual averages and variability at Winton and Kynuna are almost alike, the actual totals at the two stations can differ by as much as in some years due to isolated very heavy rainfalls.

===Soils===
The soils in the region are mainly grey and brown vertisols, with some fluvents in the drier areas. Although they do not have high phosphate contents, they have adequate levels of most other nutrients: consequently when rainfall is abundant the grasses within the basin are extremely nutritious, especially in the lower reaches of the river around Birdsville, which is a primary region for cattle fattening in years when rainfall further north is adequate to flood the region.

===Wildlife===
The floodplain of the lower reaches of the Diamantina has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it has been estimated to support at least 450,000 waterbirds when in flood, as well as globally significant numbers of the nankeen night-heron, royal spoonbill, little curlew, Australian bustard, grey grasswren, inland dotterel, cinnamon quail-thrush and pied honeyeater.

==History==

The river is ephemeral but floods periodically following heavy rainfall events in the catchment. During the floods of 1940 the mailman, Harry Ding, completed his round using a motorboat and Cooper Creek was measured at around wide. In 1950 flooding covered some , with the river described as a raging torrent wide.

Karuwali (also known as Garuwali, Dieri) is a language of far western Queensland. The Karuwali language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Diamantina Shire Council, including the localities of Betoota and Haddon Corner.

<text>Welfare economics is a field of economics that applies microeconomic techniques to evaluate the overall well-being (welfare) of a society. 

The principles of welfare economics are often used to inform public economics, which focuses on the ways in which government intervention can improve social welfare. Additionally, welfare economics serves as the theoretical foundation for several instruments of public economics, such as cost–benefit analysis. The intersection of welfare economics and behavioral economics has given rise to the subfield of behavioral welfare economics.

Two fundamental theorems are associated with welfare economics. The first states that competitive markets, under certain assumptions, lead to Pareto efficient outcomes. This idea is sometimes referred to as Adam Smith&#x27;s invisible hand. The second theorem states that with further restrictions, any Pareto efficient outcome can be achieved through a competitive market equilibrium, provided that a social planner uses a social welfare function to choose the most equitable efficient outcome and then uses lump sum transfers followed by competitive trade to achieve it. Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem which is closely related to social choice theory, is sometimes considered a third fundamental theorem of welfare economics.

Welfare economics typically involves the derivation or assumption of a social welfare function, which can then be used to rank economically feasible allocations of resources based on the social welfare they generate.

==History==

Until 1951, the objective of welfare economics remained largely uncontested. Economists viewed welfare economics as the branch of the discipline concerned with delineating the actions a governing body should undertake. It was commonly accepted that the term &quot;maximizing welfare&quot; held a specific meaning rooted in the philosophical framework of utilitarianism. Within the profession, there was ongoing debate regarding whether utility was an ordinal or cardinal concept. This debate seemed to have been addressed by Abram Bergson&#x27;s seminal paper in 1938, &quot;A Reformulation of Certain Aspects of Welfare Economics.&quot; Bergson demonstrated that economic efficiency conditions could be precisely formulated without fully specifying the underlying social welfare function. By postulating W as W(UA, UB) and assuming W to be a positive function of each individual&#x27;s utility, it was shown that maximum welfare occurred when allocative efficiency was achieved, and the marginal contribution to welfare of each individual was equalized. But this decision did not last long. In 1951, Kenneth Arrow tested whether rational collective selection rules could derive social welfare functions from individuals in preference to social states. He argued that rational law satisfies four conditions: partial universality, the Pareto principle, totalitarianism, and free will Arrow concluded that there is no rational way to articulate individual preferences forms together resulting in a harmonious social status of the various social societies.

Amartya Sen later emphasized the nature of the sequential gain approach, and Arrow&#x27;s theory emphasized it. Sen said collective action often arises in social decision-making, because Arrow&#x27;s theory is delivered through the aggregate of individual preferences rather than the formation of government or income, especially those that exist because of neutrality, presented a challenge to reconcile conflicting interests in revenue sharing. The neutral results, avoiding special utility issues, restricted the social analyzes to structural utility issues. This restriction did not exclude important information about an individual’s social status or position needed to make an income allocation decision. Sen recommended expanding the scope of data used in welfare research and emphasized the need for explicit discussion of ethics and morality in welfare economics.

== Approaches ==

=== Cardinal utility ===

The early &quot;Neoclassical approach&quot; was developed by Edgeworth, Sidgwick, Marshall, and Pigou. It assumes the following:
* Utility is cardinal, that is, scale-measurable by observation or judgment,
* Preferences are exogenously given and stable,
* Additional consumption provides smaller and smaller increases in utility (diminishing marginal utility).
With these assumptions, it is possible to construct a social welfare function simply by summing all the individual utility functions. Note that such a measure would still be concerned with the distribution of income (distributive efficiency) but not the distribution of final utilities. In normative terms, such authors were writing in the Benthamite tradition.

=== Behavioralist approach ===
The ordinal-behaviorist approach, originally called the &quot;new welfare economics&quot;, is based on the work of Pareto, Kaldor, Hicks, and Scitovsky. It explicitly recognizes the differences between the efficiency aspect of the discipline and the distribution aspect and treats them differently. Questions of efficiency are assessed with criteria such as Pareto efficiency and Kaldor–Hicks efficiency, while questions of income distribution are covered in the specification of the social welfare function Further, efficiency dispenses with cardinal measures of utility, replacing it with ordinal utility, which merely ranks commodity bundles (with an indifference-curve map, for example).

The consensus in favor of such approaches, pushed by behavioralists of the 1930s and 40s, has largely collapsed since the discovery of Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem and utility representation theorems have shown them to be mathematically self-contradictory, violating the principle of transitive preferences.

== Criteria ==
=== Efficiency ===
Situations are considered to have distributive efficiency when goods are distributed to the people who can gain the most utility from them.

Pareto efficiency is an efficiency goal that is standard in economics. A situation is Pareto-efficient only if no individual can be made better off without making someone else worse off. An example of an inefficient situation would be if Smith owns an apple but would prefer to consume an orange while Jones owns an orange but would be prefer to consume an apple. Both could be made better off by trading.

A Pareto-efficient state of affairs can only come about if four criteria are met:
* The marginal rates of substitution in consumption for any two goods are identical for all consumers. We cannot reallocate goods between two consumers and make both happier. 
* The marginal rate of transformation in production for any two goods is identical for all producers of those two goods. We cannot reallocate production between two producers and increase total output. 
* The marginal physical product of a factor input (e.g. labor) must be the same for all producers of a good. We cannot reduce production cost by reallocating production between two producers.
* The marginal rates of substitution in consumption equal the marginal rates of transformation in production for any pair of goods. Producers cannot make consumers happier by producing more of one good and less of the other.

There are a number of conditions that can lead to inefficiency. They include:
* Imperfect market structures such as monopoly, monopsony, oligopoly, oligopsony, and monopolistic competition.
* Factor allocation inefficiencies in production theory basics.
* Externalities.
* Asymmetric information, including principal–agent problems.
* Long run declining average costs in a natural monopoly.
* Taxes and tariffs.
* Government restrictions on prices and quantities sold and other regulation resulting from government failure.

Note that if one of these conditions leads to inefficiency, another condition might help by counteracting it. For example, if a pollution externality leads to overproduction of tires, a tax on tires might restore the efficient level of production. A condition inefficient in the &quot;first-best&quot; might be desirable in the second-best.

To determine whether an activity is moving the economy towards Pareto efficiency, two compensation tests have been developed. Policy changes usually help some people while hurting others, so these tests ask what would happen if the winners were to compensate the losers. Using the &quot;Kaldor criterion&quot;, the change is desirable if the maximum amount the winners would be willing to pay is greater than the minimum the losers would accept. Under the &quot;Hicks criterion&quot;, the change is desirable if the maximum the losers would be willing to offer the winners to prevent the change is less than the minimum the winners would accept as a bribe to give up the change. The Hicks compensation test is from the losers&#x27; point of view; the Kaldor compensation test is from the winners&#x27;. If both conditions are satisfied, the proposed change will move the economy toward Pareto optimality. This idea is known as Kaldor–Hicks efficiency. If the two conditions disagree, that yields the Scitovsky paradox.

===Equity===
There are many combinations of consumer utility, production mixes, and factor input combinations consistent with efficiency. In fact, there are an infinity of consumption and production equilibria that yield Pareto optimal results. There are as many optima as there are points on the aggregate production–possibility frontier. Hence, Pareto efficiency is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for social welfare. Each Pareto optimum corresponds to a different income distribution in the economy. Some may involve great inequalities of income. So how do we decide which Pareto optimum is most desirable? This decision is made, either tacitly or overtly, when we specify the social welfare function. This function embodies value judgements about interpersonal utility. The social welfare function shows the relative importance of the individuals that comprise society.

A utilitarian welfare function (also called a Benthamite welfare function) sums the utility of each individual in order to obtain society&#x27;s overall welfare. All people are treated the same, regardless of their initial level of utility. One extra unit of utility for a starving person is not seen to be of any greater value than an extra unit of utility for a millionaire. At the other extreme is the Max-Min, or Rawlsian utility function. According to the Max-Min criterion, welfare is maximized when the utility of those society members that have the least is the greatest. No economic activity will increase social welfare unless it improves the position of the society member that is the worst off. Most economists specify social welfare functions that are intermediate between these two extremes.

The social welfare function is typically translated into social indifference curves so that they can be used in the same graphic space as the other functions that they interact with. A utilitarian social indifference curve is linear and downward sloping to the right. The Max-Min social indifference curve takes the shape of two straight lines joined so as they form a 90-degree angle. A social indifference curve drawn from an intermediate social welfare function is a curve that slopes downward to the right.

The intermediate form of social indifference curve can be interpreted as showing that as inequality increases, a larger improvement in the utility of relatively rich individuals is needed to compensate for the loss in utility of relatively poor individuals.

A crude social welfare function can be constructed by measuring the subjective dollar value of goods and services distributed to participants in the economy.

== Fundamental theorems ==

The field of welfare economics is associated with two fundamental theorems. The first states that given certain assumptions, competitive markets (price equilibria with transfers, e.g. Walrasian equilibria) produce Pareto efficient outcomes. The assumptions required are generally characterised as &quot;very weak&quot;. More specifically, the existence of competitive equilibrium implies both price-taking behaviour and complete markets, but the only additional assumption is the local non-satiation of agents&#x27; preferences – that consumers would like, at the margin, to have slightly more of any given good. The first fundamental theorem is said to capture the logic of Adam Smith&#x27;s invisible hand, though in general there is no reason to suppose that the &quot;best&quot; Pareto efficient point (of which there are a set) will be selected by the market without intervention, only that some such point will be.

The second fundamental theorem states that given further restrictions, any Pareto efficient outcome can be supported as a competitive market equilibrium. These restrictions are stronger than for the first fundamental theorem, with convexity of preferences and production functions a sufficient but not necessary condition. A direct consequence of the second theorem is that a benevolent social planner could use a system of lump sum transfers to ensure that the &quot;best&quot; Pareto efficient allocation was supported as a competitive equilibrium for some set of prices. More generally, it suggests that redistribution should, if possible, be achieved without affecting prices (which should continue to reflect relative scarcity), thus ensuring that the final (post-trade) result is efficient. Put into practice, such a policy might resemble predistribution.

Because of welfare economics&#x27; close ties to social choice theory, Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem is sometimes listed as a third fundamental theorem.

==Social welfare maximization==
Utility functions can be derived from the points on a contract curve. Numerous utility functions can be derived, one for each point on the production possibility frontier (PQ in the diagram above). A social utility frontier (also called a grand utility frontier) can be obtained from the outer envelope of all these utility functions. Each point on a social utility frontier represents an efficient allocation of an economy&#x27;s resources; that is, it is a Pareto optimum in factor allocation, in production, in consumption, and in the interaction of production and consumption (supply and demand). In the diagram below, the curve MN is a social utility frontier. Point D corresponds with point C from the earlier diagram. Point D is on the social utility frontier because the marginal rate of substitution at point C is equal to the marginal rate of transformation at point A. Point E corresponds with point B in the previous diagram, and lies inside the social utility frontier (indicating inefficiency) because the MRS at point C is not equal to the MRT at point A.
Although all the points on the grand social utility frontier are Pareto efficient, only one point identifies where social welfare is maximized. Such point is called &quot;the point of bliss&quot;. This point is Z where the social utility frontier MN is tangent to the highest possible social indifference curve labelled SI.

<text>Puzzletown () is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Blair County, Pennsylvania, United States.

==Geography==
Puzzletown is found at the bottom of a valley which leads up to Blue Knob, the second-highest mountain in the state and part of the Allegheny Front, the eastern edge of the Appalachian Plateau. It is a rural area with a population of three to five hundred at its most liberal definition and less than one hundred at its most restrictive.

Puzzletown is considered by most to be the Puzzletown Road, a road leading to the southwest from Newry, and all of the short side streets and housing developments on it; others extend this for several miles after the road&#x27;s name becomes Knob Run Road and others limit it to only the intersection of Puzzletown Road and Poplar Run Road and the few nearby side streets.

==History==
Formerly called Poplar Run, Puzzletown was founded in about 1840.

==Education==
Part of the CDP is in the Hollidaysburg Area School District while the rest is in the Spring Cove School District.

<doc id="438578" wikidata="Q2133089" url="?curid=438578" title="Smoking fetishism">
<text>Smoking fetishism (also known as capnolagnia) is a sexual fetish based on the pulmonary consumption (smoking) of tobacco, most often via cigarettes, cigars, cannabis and also pipes, vapes, and hookahs to some extent. As a fetish, its mechanisms regard sexual arousal from the observation or imagination of a person smoking, sometimes including oneself.

==Background==
Capnolagnia is not considered a disease but an unusual sexual practice, and many of the fetishists do not seek medical help unless this behavior strongly interferes with their daily lives. The majority of people simply learn to accept their fetish and manage to achieve gratification in an appropriate manner.

A 2003 study found that the fetish was not previously the subject of academic study but had been mentioned in &quot;a few newspapers&quot;.

==Causes==
Like any fetish, the causes and mechanisms of a smoking fetish vary widely, with roots of sexual association in early childhood and adolescence. Typical causes and hypotheses include:

* aesthetics: mere attraction to, and gratification of, the visual aspect of smoke as it exits the mouth
* childhood: experience or interaction with one or more attractive smoking individuals during childhood
* impulsivity: perceived symbolism of an audacious or impulsivity personality, insinuating promiscuity
* mannerism: masculine or feminine body language of smokers
* media: early exposure to sexualized depictions of smokers, especially from advertising media, the film noir era, and pornography
* persuasion: perceived power of convincing or urging another individual to smoke
* psychosexual development: phenomena in the oral and phallic stages of childhood development, based on Freudian theory
* sadomasochism: pleasure from infliction of bodily harm caused by smoking, often called &quot;lung damage&quot;
* self-confidence: perceived confidence or masculinity of the smoker, regarding taboo or wealth
* taboo: perceived independence or rebellion regarding the act of smoking, amongst cultural adversity to smokers
* wealth: attraction to individuals who are wealthy enough to fund a cigarette or cigar habit

==In the adult industry==
Smoking has often been associated with the dominatrix role in BDSM, and numerous adult production for the kink community feature scenes depicting smoking and other acts related to it, such as extinguishing cigarettes on characters or forcing characters to inhale the smoke. Over the years, numerous studios formed, which specialize in producing adult material aimed mainly at smoking fetishists. Some of the studios also offer custom-made productions catering to sub-fetishes, such as a smoking female extinguishing a cigarette on the leather seats of a luxury car.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnostic criteria for fetishism are:
* Unusual sexual fantasies, drives or behavior occur over a time span of at least six months. Sometimes unusual sexual fantasies occur and vanish by themselves; in this case any medical treatment is not necessary.
* The affected person, their object or another person experience impairment or distress in multiple functional areas. Functional area refers to different aspects of life such as private social contacts, job, etc. It is sufficient for the diagnosis if one of the participants is being hurt or mistreated in any other way.

People who experience one or more of the symptoms below are considered to have a smoking fetish:
* Sexual interest in smoking or watching other people smoking.
* Recurring intense sexual fantasies involving smoking or watching other people smoking.
* Recurring intense sexual urges involving smoking or watching other people smoking.

<doc id="438579" wikidata="Q6978619" url="?curid=438579" title="National Space Institute">
<text>The National Space Institute was a space advocacy group, the first of its kind, established by Wernher von Braun to help maintain the public&#x27;s support for the United States space program. It has since merged, in 1987, with the L5 Society founded by fans of the Space Colonization and Industrialization work of Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill, to become the present-day National Space Society.

==Founding==
In its earliest stages of formation in June 1974, NSI was first known as the &quot;National Space Association&quot;, but was renamed from &quot;Association&quot; to &quot;Institute&quot; in April 1975. Von Braun was the NSI&#x27;s first president, but shortly became chairman, with journalist and former ABC-TV &quot;20/20&quot; host Hugh Downs as president. Charles C. Hewitt was the first executive director.

Downs later recalled the beginning of the organization: 

At the first annual meeting of the organization, in July 1975, von Braun said: 

Initial members serving on the NSI board of directors and governors were a veritable &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; list that included comedian and entertainer Bob Hope, singer/songwriter John Denver, oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, &quot;Original 7&quot; Project Mercury astronaut and Senator John H. Glenn Jr., Apollo 8 astronaut Frank Borman, Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, Michael DeBakey, &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry and actress Nichelle Nichols.

Toward the end of 1975, von Braun commented on the state of the general public&#x27;s interest in the space program. 

==Relationship with &quot;Omni&quot; magazine==
After some years of publishing a newsletter that became known as &quot;INSIght&quot;, the Institute entered into an arrangement with the publishers of &quot;Omni&quot; magazine whereby all members except life members would receive that magazine as part of their membership. &quot;Omni&quot; editor Ben Bova joined the NSI board, then became vice president and finally succeeded Downs as president. He continued as president after the &quot;Omni&quot; arrangement was discontinued and an agreement was made with Palmer Publications to make their monthly general space interest magazine &quot;Space World&quot; the official NSI member magazine.

When von Braun died in June 1977, Hugh Downs became Chairman of the Board and, after a time, Ben Bova assumed the presidency. After Hewitt departed in 1980, Courtney Stadd served for a period as General Manager. The Institute was then led until 1984 by executive director Mark R. Chartrand, followed by Glen P. Wilson.

==Merger==
Under Bova and Wilson, the arrangements for merger with the L5 Society were concluded, and the name change to National Space Society was announced in advance of the merger, with vague explanations to the members. Since the merger, it has been claimed that the name change took place upon the merger, but the historical record to the contrary is clear. Following the merger, Wilson was succeeded by his assistant, Lori Garver. The merged organization has continued to use the NSS name and logo after a joint membership vote was taken in 1987 to determine whether or not to change it to the &quot;Space Frontier Society.&quot;

A more complete history of the National Space Institute is contained in a series of articles published in the November/December 1994 issue of &quot;Ad Astra&quot;, the magazine of the NSS.

<doc id="438589" wikidata="Q1258651" url="?curid=438589" title="Dresser Industries">
<text>Dresser Industries was a multinational corporation headquartered in Dallas, Texas, United States, which provided a wide range of technology, products, and services used for developing energy and natural resources. In 1998, Dresser merged with its main rival Halliburton. Halliburton sold many of former Dresser non &quot;oil patch&quot; divisions, retaining the M W Kellogg Engineering and Construction Company and the Dresser oil-patch products and services that complemented Halliburton&#x27;s energy and natural resource businesses. In 2001 Halliburton sold five separate, but somewhat related former Dresser non &quot;oil patch&quot; divisions, to an investment banking firm. Those five operations later took the name &quot;Dresser Inc.&quot; In October 2010, Dresser Inc., was acquired by General Electric. It is headquartered in Addison, Texas.

==History==
Solomon Robert Dresser invented a &quot;packer&quot;, using rubber for a tight fit, and after taking out a patent on May 11, 1880, he began advertising and selling his product, the &quot;Dresser Cap Packer&quot;, from Bradford, Pennsylvania, in the heart of the oilfields. Dresser&#x27;s packer was one of many available on the market, and it was another invention that saw a substantial expansion of the company. A flexible coupling, the &quot;Dresser Joint&quot;, that he built in 1885 to join pipes together in such a way that they would not leak natural gas. This coupling also used rubber for a tight fit, and it was so successful that it permitted for the first time the long-range transmission of natural gas from the gas fields where it was extracted to the cities which were the main gas consumers.

As the natural gas industry prospered and expanded after 1900, Dresser&#x27;s company grew as pipelines were built over great distances. By 1927 the company&#x27;s annual sales had reached US$3.7 million and it was employing 400 workers.

===Public offering===
Following Dresser&#x27;s death, his descendants decided to sell it, and in 1928 the Wall Street investment-banking firm of W. A. Harriman and Company, Inc., converted the firm into a public company by issuing 300,000 shares of stock.

H. Neil Mallon was selected as president and chief executive officer; he held that position until his retirement in 1962. Under Mallon, Dresser began a program of acquisitions designed to help it survive the threat posed to its core business by the introduction of welding for joining pipes together. Starting in 1930 Dresser began acquiring companies that manufactured valves, heaters, pumps, engines and compressors and the company diversified into such products as oil derricks, blowers, drill bits, refractories, and drilling mud.

==Acquisitions and divestitures==
In 1949, Dresser&#x27;s management was presented with an opportunity to broaden its product range beyond capital purchases. They were made aware of the potential to acquire the Magnet Cove Barium Corporation of Houston, Texas, the nation&#x27;s second-largest producer of barite drilling mud. One of the partners was interested in selling their approximate one-third interest, which led to discussions with the owners about the possibility of selling the entire company. With Dresser&#x27;s strong cash position, they began to explore the acquisition of Magnet Cove Barium. It held mineral reserves constituting 30 percent of the known U.S. barite deposits, and the 5 ½ million tons of barite could last thirty-eight more years at the current recoverable bar level of operations. The company reported current assets of $3.2 million and liabilities of $909,000. When it was learned that all of the Magnet Cove Barium&#x27;s common stock could be acquired for $2.8 million in cash, the directors of Dresser quickly, without hesitation, approved the transaction on October 28, 1949. Five days later, the deal was done. Dresser had added Magnet Cove Barium to the Dresser Industries family.

In 1950, the company headquarters moved to Dallas to be near the center of the nation&#x27;s major oil and gas fields. It continued to purchase well-known companies involved in manufacturing such things as overhead cranes, gasoline-dispensing pumps, and heavy equipment for mining and construction.

In 1968, the Wayne Oil Tank and Pump Company, established in 1891, merged with Dresser, becoming the Dresser-Wayne Company. Dresser Industries brought together Lane-Wells and the Pan Geo Atlas Corporation (PGAC) to form Dresser Atlas. PGAC&#x27;s expertise in openhole logging and its international operations made it an ideal merger partner to form an integrated wireline services company. Since its inception, Lane-Wells had generated most of its income from perforating services, but log interpretation had narrowed down producing zones, resulting in fewer perforations and less revenue. Greatly expanded wireline logging capabilities helped the combined company continue to grow.

In 1974, the company acquired the operating assets of the Jeffrey Manufacturing Company and its subsidiary the Galion Iron Works. By 1975, Dresser&#x27;s total sales exceeded $2 billion, with profits of more than $123 million. Those sales came 28% from petroleum operations, 21% from industrial specialties, 24% from energy processing and conversion, 15% from construction and mining, and 12% from refractories and minerals.

During the 1980s, as the oil industry began to decline, Dresser&#x27;s chairman, John Murphy, began to streamline the organization of the company, eliminating its insurance, mining, and construction-equipment divisions.

In 1982, the company acquired International Harvester&#x27;s construction equipment business.
In 1984 the company acquired the earthmoving and mining product lines from American Standard&#x27;s WABCO division, for a bargain price of $66.3 million.

On January 1, 1987, Dresser Industries and Ingersoll-Rand merged their common businesses to form Dresser-Rand Group with headquarters in Corning, New York. The newly formed company had 10 manufacturing and testing facilities, 70 sales offices, 30 service centers and more than 7,300 employees. The partnership started as a 50-50 relationship, but later Dresser took a 51% share of the assets while Ingersoll-Rand had 49%.

Komatsu Limited and Dresser Industries established Komatsu Dresser to make mining tractors, construction equipment and related equipment. This 50-50 ownership lasted from September 1988 to August 1994, when Komatsu bought out Dresser&#x27;s share.

By 1993, it generated sales of more than US$4 billion, and employed 31,800 people in fifty countries. The company had three major divisions: Oil Field Products and Services, Industrial Operations, and Energy Processing and Conversion Equipment. It spun off some of its manufacturing divisions, but crucially agreed to retain asbestos claims filed before the spinoff.

In 1994, the company expanded through acquisitions of Wheatley TXT (a manufacturer of pumps, valves, and metering equipment) and the Baroid Corporation (an oil-services firm in Houston that had been a direct competitor). To comply with federal antitrust regulations, Dresser sold off its interest in M-I Drilling Fluids Company and Western Atlas International. Upon completion of the Baroid merger, Dresser became the third-largest oil-services company in the world.

===Merger with Halliburton===
In 1998, Dresser merged with its main rival Halliburton and became known as Halliburton Company. Dick Cheney negotiated the US$7.7 billion deal, reportedly having done so during a weekend of quail-hunting. In 2001, Halliburton was forced to settle the asbestos lawsuits that it acquired including the landmark case Bell v. Dresser Industries as a result of purchasing Dresser, causing the company&#x27;s stock price to fall by eighty percent in just over a year.

==The &quot;New&quot; Dresser==

In April 2001, the Dresser division (excluding the former Kellogg division) entered an agreement to separate itself once again from Halliburton by management purchasing its equity, the new company was called Dresser, Inc. It was a leading global multi-national owned by First Reserve Corporation and company management.

In February 2011, General Electric Co. agreed to buy oil-field equipment maker Dresser Inc. for $3 billion, expanding its biggest industrial unit. GE acquired Dresser from funds managed by Riverstone Holdings LLC and First Reserve Corporation. The move significantly expanded GE&#x27;s offerings for energy and industrial customers worldwide and is the latest in a series of acquisitions over the last 10 years that have transformed GE&#x27;s global energy portfolio.

The Dresser brand sells, services, and supports products that include: actuators, valves, meters, instruments, regulators, switches, natural gas-fueled engines, piping specialties, retail and fleet fuel dispensers, blowers, and point-of-sale systems.

The Dresser brand operates in more than 60 countries with four principal business segments: Measurement and Distribution Systems, Flow Technologies, Infrastructure Solutions, and Power and Compression Systems. It retains trade names of Masoneilan, Consolidated, Becker, Mooney, ROOTS, and Wayne fuel pumps.

<doc id="438600" wikidata="Q10572199" url="?curid=438600" title="German General Staff">
<text>The German General Staff, originally the Prussian General Staff and officially the Great General Staff (), was a full-time body at the head of the Prussian Army and later, the German Army, responsible for the continuous study of all aspects of war, and for drawing up and reviewing plans for mobilization or campaign. It existed unofficially from 1806, and was formally established by law in 1814, the first general staff in existence. It was distinguished by the formal selection of its officers by intelligence and proven merit rather than patronage or wealth, and by the exhaustive and rigorously structured training which its staff officers undertook.

The Prussian General Staff also enjoyed greater freedom from political control than its contemporaries, and this autonomy was enshrined in law on the unification of Germany and the establishment of the German Empire in 1871. It came to be regarded as the home of German militarism in the aftermath of World War I, and the victorious Allies attempted to suppress the institution. It nevertheless survived to play its accustomed part in the German rearmament and World War II.

In a broader sense, the Prussian General Staff corps consisted of those officers qualified to perform staff duties, and formed a unique military fraternity. Their exhaustive training was designed not only to weed out the less motivated or less able candidates, but also to produce a body of professional military experts with common methods and outlook. General Staff–qualified officers alternated between line and staff duties but remained lifelong members of this special organization.

Until the end of the German Empire, social and political convention often placed members of noble or royal households in command of its armies or corps but the actual responsibility for the planning and conduct of operations lay with the formation&#x27;s staff officers. For other European armies which lacked this professionally trained staff corps, the same conventions were often a recipe for disaster. Even the Army of the Second French Empire, whose senior officers had supposedly reached high rank as a result of bravery and success on the battlefield, was crushed by the Prussian and other German armies during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871. That outcome highlighted poor French administration and planning, and lack of professional education.

The chief of staff of a Prussian formation in the field had the right to disagree, in writing, with the plans or orders of the commander of the formation, and appeal to the commander of the next highest formation (which might ultimately be the king, or emperor, who would be guided by the head of the Great General Staff). This served as a check on incompetence and also served for the objecting officer to officially disassociate himself from a flawed plan. Only the most stubborn commanders would not give way before this threat.

For these reasons, Prussian and German military victories were often credited professionally to the chief of staff, rather than to the nominal commander of an army. Often the commander of an army was himself a member of the General Staff, but it was now institutionally recognized that not only was command leadership important, but effective staff work was a significant key to success in both pre-war planning and in wartime operations.
==History==
===Early history===
Before the nineteenth century, success on the battlefield largely depended on the military competence of the sovereign. Duke Frederick William introduced the term &quot;Generalstabsdienst&quot; (General Staff Service) for the Prusso-Brandenburgian army in 1640. While Frederick the Great brought success to the Prussian arms, his successors lacked his talent, so generalship in the Army declined, even though they were assisted by a Quartermaster General Staff of adjutants and engineers established by Frederick the Great. Reformers in the army began to write and lecture on the need to preserve and somehow institutionalize the military talent that Frederick had assembled in his army. They argued that a carefully assembled cadre of talented officer staff could plan logistics and train the Army in peace as well as in war. In the last years of the eighteenth century, it became the practice to assign military experts to assist the generals of Prussia&#x27;s Army, largely at the instigation of comparatively junior but gifted officers such as Gerhard von Scharnhorst and August von Gneisenau. Nevertheless, such measures were insufficient to overcome the inefficiency of the Army, which was commanded by aged veterans of the campaigns of Frederick the Great, almost half a century earlier.

In 1806, the Prussian Army was routed by French Armies led by Napoleon&#x27;s marshals at the Battle of Jena. In the aftermath of this debacle, the Prussian Army and state largely collapsed. &quot;Seldom in history has an army been reduced to impotence more swiftly or decisively.&quot; After the Peace of Tilsit in 1807, King Frederick William III appointed Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, Prime Minister Baron vom und zum Stein and several promising young officers to his Military Reorganization Commission. This commission acted as a general staff to plan and implement the reconstruction of the Prussian Army. They persuaded the king that to match the French commanders, who rose by merit, each Prussian commander of an Army, Corps and Division should have a staff-trained officer assigned as his adjutant. Scharnhorst intended them to &quot;support incompetent Generals, providing the talents that might otherwise be wanting among leaders and commanders&quot;. The unlikely pairing of the erratic but popular Field Marshal Blücher as commander in chief with Lieutenant General Gneisenau as his chief of staff showed this system to its best advantage: Blücher lauded Gneisenau for his role in maneuvering the Prussian Army during a difficult retreat through the Harz mountains.

Gneisenau is recognized as the first &quot;great Chief of Staff&quot;. He institutionalized the right of the commander&#x27;s adviser to take part in command and control by advising the commander until he makes a decision. Gneisenau also founded mission tactics (&quot;Auftragstaktik&quot;), in which the commander determines the objective of an operation and allocates the forces used, while the subordinate on the spot determines how the objective will be attained.

In 1816, the reformer Karl von Grolman organised the Staff into Eastern (Russia), Southern (Austria), and Western (France and the other German states) Divisions. Sixteen staff officers served in the Prussian Ministry of War and six staff officers worked in the main embassies. Each army corps had one chief of staff and two other staff officers. In 1821 the Quartermaster General Staff was renamed to the General Staff, and its officers were identified by distinctive uniform markings, including a crimson trouser stripe. Staff positions did not depend on lineage. &quot;General von Krauseneck, who was the Chief of the General Staff from 1829 to 1848, was the son of a Brandenburg organ player and had been promoted from the ranks. General von Rheyer, Chief of the Prussian General Staff from 1848 to 1857 was a shepherd in his youth.&quot;

The General Staff continually planned for likely and unlikely scenarios. In 1843, when Europe had been largely at peace for nearly thirty years and most major nations had no plans for war, observers noted sheaves of orders at the Prussian War Ministry, already made out to cover all foreseeable contingencies and requiring only a signature and a date stamp to be put into effect.

===Selection and education of staff officers===
The Military Reorganization Commission opened military schools in Königsberg and Breslau. On 15 October 1810 Scharnhorst opened the General War School (&quot;Allgemeine Kriegsschule&quot;), on the same day that the new University of Berlin opened nearby. The General War School trained selected officers for three years. One of its first directors was Carl von Clausewitz, who served until 1830. His monumental work On War (&quot;Vom Kriege&quot;) was published posthumously. From his studies and experiences during the Napoleonic Wars, he wrote a syllabus which became the staff&#x27;s central doctrine. This standardization of doctrine which was an attempt to grasp the philosophy underlying warfare, rather than setting a narrow set of rules such as those laid down by Antoine-Henri Jomini was one of the distinguishing features of the Prussian General Staff.

Every General Staff officer had to be able, at any time, to take over the work of another and apply to it the same body of basic ideas and the same principles of operational and tactical thought.

On October 1, 1859, the General War School was renamed the War Academy (&quot;Kriegsakademie&quot;), which was supervised by the Inspector-General of Military Education. Students at the War Academy attended about 20 hours of lectures per week. Instruction was by professors from Berlin University and officers serving on the Great General Staff, who thereby enhanced their own educations. In 1872 the War Academy was taken from the Inspector of Military Education and placed under the Chief of the General Staff. The spirit of the academy was articulated by Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke, who emphasized the importance &quot;of an active process of mental give and take between teacher and pupils, so as to stimulate the pupils to become fellow-workers&quot;.

Admission to the academy was highly selective. Officers with at least five years service who wanted to become General Staff officers prepared themselves for the entrance examination, which included tactics, surveying, geography, mathematics and French, with questions set to test understanding rather than rote memory. The graders of the essays did not know the names or regiments of the candidates. From hundreds of applicants, about one hundred were accepted every year to enter the first-year course at the academy. Those who performed satisfactorily were promoted to the second and then the third year.

In the first year, fourteen hours of lectures each week were on military subjects, including military history, while seventeen hours were non-military, which included general history, mathematics, science and a choice of French or Russian. Roughly the same time allocations were used in the last two years. Lectures were supplemented by visits to fortifications, arms factories and exercises of the railway regiment. During the three month summer breaks the students attended manoeuvres and were taken on field tactical exercises in which they commanded imaginary units. At the end of the course they took their second examination. Only about thirty students passed this extremely difficult test. They were then assigned (&quot;kommandiert&quot;) to the Great General Staff, while retaining their regimental attachments. After two years they took their third and final examination, after which five to eight officers were permanently posted to fill vacancies in the General Staff a remarkable winnowing from the many who had entered the competition. Occasionally, an exceptional officer was appointed without this training: for example Max Bauer, who was trained as an artilleryman, became a prominent member of the Great General Staff, with the reputation of being the smartest man in the army.

Some graduates were not enthusiastic about the first year of their training. For example, Paul von Hindenburg thought that the history of ancient battles should be minimized to give more time to modern, and that trigonometry was only useful to those who would be surveyors. The final two years satisfied him. While at the academy he was invited into the social circle of Prince Alexander of Prussia, where he came &quot;in touch with men of science as well as those in the state and court service.

After its defeat in the war against Prussia of 1866, Bavaria established its own War Academy and continued to train its own staff officers after the foundation of the German Empire in 1870.

===Size of the staff===
The General Staff of that time was a small, elite body, numbering as few as fifty officers and rarely exceeding one hundred officers. Only one or two officers were permanently assigned to the General Staff, described in official returns as &quot;des Generalstabs&quot; (&quot;of the General Staff&quot;) at any time; most were attached to the General Staff while remaining affiliated to their parent regiments, usually for several years at a time, and were listed as &quot;im Generalstab&quot; (&quot;on the General Staff&quot;). When the General Staff was required to take the field during major campaigns, it remained a small but effective body. During the Franco-Prussian War for example, the staff that accompanied the headquarters of the King (as commander-in-chief) and was responsible for the direction of armies that totaled 850,000 men, consisted of the chief of staff, a quartermaster-general and an intendant-general whose duties were not directly concerned with military operations, three heads of departments, eleven other officers, ten draughtsmen, seven clerks and fifty-nine other ranks (orderlies, messengers, etc.).

Nor was there ever a large pool of officers to draw upon to perform General Staff duties. In 1871, there were only 375 officers fully qualified to serve on the General Staff, even after an emergency expansion during the Franco-Prussian War. In 1914, there were 625 General Staff-qualified officers for armies which had almost doubled in size since 1871.

===Moltke the Elder===

In 1857, Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, a widely travelled officer who was a confidante of King William I, was appointed Chief of the General Staff. Under his control, the existing staff system was expanded and consolidated.

Each year, Moltke selected the best twelve graduates from the &quot;Kriegsakademie&quot; for his personal training as General Staff officers. They attended theoretical studies, annual manoeuvres, &quot;war rides&quot; (a system of tactical exercises without troops in the field) under Moltke himself, and war games and map exercises known as &quot;Kriegsspiele&quot;. Although these officers subsequently alternated between regimental and staff duties, they could be relied upon to think and act exactly as Moltke had taught them when they became the Chiefs of Staff of major formations. Moltke himself referred to them as the &quot;nervous system&quot; of the Prussian Army. In the victories which the Prussian Army was to gain against Austrian Empire and France, Moltke needed only to issue brief directives expressing his intentions to the main formations, leaving the staffs at the subordinate headquarters to implement the details according to the doctrines and methods he had laid down, while the Supreme Commands of his opponents became bogged down in mountains of paperwork and trivia as they tried to control the entire army from a single overworked headquarters.

Moltke&#x27;s wide experience also prompted the General Staff to consider fields of study outside the purely military, and rapidly adapt them to military use. Immediately upon his appointment, he established the &quot;Abteilung&quot; (section or department) which studied and promoted the development of railway networks within Prussia and incorporated them into its deployment plans. He also formed telegraphic, and other scientific and technical departments within the General Staff and a Historical division, which analysed past and current conflicts and published accounts of them and lessons learned.

The General Staff reformed by Moltke was the most effective in Europe, an autonomous institution dedicated solely to the efficient execution of war, unlike in other countries, whose staffs were often fettered by meddling courtiers, parliaments and government officials. On the contrary, the General Staff itself had a powerful effect on Prussian, and later German, politics.

====War with Denmark====
The Second Schleswig War (1864), the political origins of which lay in Denmark&#x27;s conflict with Prussia and Austria over the Schleswig–Holstein question, vindicated Moltke&#x27;s concepts of operations and led to an overhaul of the command arrangements of the Prussian Army. Moltke envisaged a rapid attack to prevent the Danes falling back behind water obstacles which the Prussian Navy could not overcome. A rigid system of seniority placed Friedrich Graf von Wrangel, widely regarded as being in his dotage, in command. He ignored all of Moltke&#x27;s directives and his own staff&#x27;s advice, and by allowing the Danish Army to withdraw at its leisure he prolonged the war for several months. The resulting &quot;post mortem&quot; was to ensure a better (though not infallible) system for appointing commanders.

====Seven Weeks&#x27; War====
The Austro-Prussian War (1866) became almost inevitable after the end of hostilities with Denmark. Many Prussians regarded the war as a sad necessity. Moltke, describing his reasons for confidence to War Minister Albrecht von Roon, stated &quot;We have the inestimable advantage of being able to carry our Field Army of 285,000 men over five railway lines and of virtually concentrating them in twenty-five days ... Austria has only one railway line and it will take her forty-five days to assemble 200,000 men.&quot; Although there were inevitable mistakes and confusion on the battlefield, Moltke&#x27;s pre-war calculations were proved correct, and the Austrian army was brought to battle at Königgrätz and destroyed.

In contrast to the Prussian staff, Austrian staff officers gained their posts either by membership of the Austrian nobility and a desire to avoid tedious regimental duties, or after uninspiring training which made them into plodding, rule-bound clerks. In all aspects of preparation, planning and execution, their muddled efforts compared badly with that of their Prussian counterparts.

====Prussian staff analysis and army improvements====
In reviewing Prussian deficiencies against the Austrians, the General Staff made several improvements to increase the strategic and tactical proficiency of the King&#x27;s army. Cavalry would no longer be held in reserve, but would actively screen the army&#x27;s movements at all levels, make first contact with the enemy, and constantly observe hostile activities. Newly developed rifled artillery would no longer be placed in the rear of the order of march for employment behind the infantry; instead, a significant detachment would travel with the advanced guard of the leading corps or other major element, and the remainder would march with the front of the main body, providing immediate artillery coverage of the advanced guard on contact and of the main body during subsequent deployment on the field. A renewed emphasis was placed on maintaining contact with subordinate and superior commands, so that commanders always were informed of units&#x27; locations on the battlefield, reducing the &quot;fog of war&quot; effect. Finally, the introduction of the breech-loading infantry rifle marked a revolution in weapons effect, so that Moltke made the following analysis in 1865:

The attack of a position is becoming notably more difficult than its defense. The defensive during the first phase of battle offers a decisive superiority. The task of a skillful offensive will consist of forcing our foe to attack a position chosen by us, and only when casualties, demoralization, and exhaustion have drained his strength will we ourselves take up the tactical offensive... Our strategy must be offensive, our tactics defensive.

====Franco-Prussian War====
The government of Napoleon III was undoubtedly startled by the Prussian victory over Austria, and urgently sought to reform their army to face the conflict with Prussia which seemed inevitable and imminent. Their senior officers entirely failed to grasp the methods of the Prussian General Staff. The Chief of Staff of the French Army, &quot;Maréchal de France&quot; Edmond Le Bœuf, fatuously stated in 1870 that the French Army was ready for war, &quot;down to the last gaiter button.&quot; In the event, at the outset of the Franco-Prussian War, 462,000 German soldiers concentrated flawlessly on the French frontier while only 270,000 French soldiers could be moved to face them, the French army having lost 100,000 stragglers before a shot was fired through poor planning and administration. (Most of these were reservists who had not been able to join their units before the units were hastily dispatched to join the armies forming up near the frontier.)

During the war, there were again the inevitable mistakes due to the &quot;fog of war&quot;, but German formations moved with a speed and precision which French staff officers, accustomed only to moving battalion-sized punitive columns, could not match. In the French army of the time, there was an anti-intellectual prejudice in favour of brave and unimaginative regimental officers over intelligent and well-trained staff officers. The French Army paid dearly for this bias in 1870 and 1871.

The result of the strategic preparation by Moltke (and diplomatic maneuvers by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck) was complete Prussian victory. After the victory, Germany was unified as the Prussia-dominated German Empire; King Wilhelm I of Prussia was proclaimed &quot;German Emperor&quot; on 18 January 1871. The German victory surprised many military professionals around the world. France had been considered a great military power while Prussia was widely considered a lesser power, despite its military successes in 1813–15 against Napoleon and more recently over Austria during the Seven Weeks&#x27; War of 1866. Many nations adopted Prussian staff methods and structures, with mixed success.

Throughout his tenure, Moltke pushed for the Prussian army to engage in reassessment and self-improvement at every command level to maintain tactical superiority relative to other nations. Moltke formalised the concept of mission-type tactics, which emphasized the importance of initiative at all levels of command, even the lowest. Every Prussian tactical manual published after the Franco-Prussian War included this passage:

A favorable situation will never be exploited if commanders wait for orders. The highest commander and the youngest soldier must always be conscious of the fact that omission and inactivity are worse than resorting to the wrong expedient.

===From unification to World War I===

With unification the Prussian General Staff became the Imperial German General Staff, with seconded general staff officers from Saxony, Württemberg and Bavaria, and was responsible for military planning for the German Empire. They began preparing for what seemed to be another inevitable war with France, which was intent on revenge and recovery of the provinces annexed by Germany. Bismarck&#x27;s diplomatic skill had prevented any hostile European coalition forming against Germany, but the young Kaiser William II replaced him in 1890 and turned away from their friendly accommodation with Russia in favor of an alliance with Austria-Hungary. Before long France and Russia allied.

Therefore, an encircled Germany faced the probability that of war on both Eastern and Western fronts. Prior to his retirement in 1888, Moltke&#x27;s plan for such a conflict had always been to remain on the defensive against the French while committing the majority of German forces to face Russia. Changing geopolitical factors around the turn of the century, including the establishment of vast European colonial empires and especially the rapprochement between the United Kingdom and France eventually led the German General Staff to reassess the wisdom of such a strategy. Whereas Moltke and his immediate successor Alfred von Waldersee were confident in the ability of a relatively modest German garrison to defend the country&#x27;s western frontier against the forces of Metropolitan France indefinitely, the General Staff under Alfred von Schlieffen determined that British neutrality in a future conflict could no longer be counted on, thus exposing Germany to the potential combined might of the British, French and their vast colonial empires in the west in case of any extended conflict.

To meet such a threat, Schlieffen and his successor Helmuth von Moltke the Younger drew up and continually refined the Schlieffen Plan to meet this eventuality. The Plan committed Germany to an early offensive against France while Russia was still mobilising and also required the invasion of neutral Belgium, effectively discounting any realistic prospect of maintaining British neutrality. In Bismarck&#x27;s German constitution the Kaiser commanded the army and also appointed the chancellor and his cabinet, who had no control of the military. The elected representatives in the Reichstag were needed to pass budgets, but aside from this had no power over the conduct of the government. This was one of the seeds of the mass destruction of the First World War, as military planning was not subject to political control. Thus, the Schlieffen Plan was adopted without political input, even though it required the violation of the neutrality of Belgium, which the Germans had guaranteed by treaty. Nor was the German Navy&#x27;s high command informed. It failed to take adequate account of logistics and the inability of horse-drawn transport to supply troops far from rail-heads. The plan has been accused of being too rigid. The philosopher Manuel de Landa argues that the Prussian army now favored the Jominian theory, which gave preeminence to the Army and to its autonomy, compared to the civilian control advocated by Clausewitz.

To an extent, the General Staff became obsessed with perfecting the methods which had gained victory in the late nineteenth century. Although he maintained an icy formal demeanor, Moltke the Elder had been a flexible and innovative thinker in many fields. Schlieffen, by comparison, was a single-minded, brilliant military specialist.

Nor had the General Staff, before the war, considered the use of potential allies such as Turkey, or dissident factions within the French, British and Russian empires, to distract or weaken the Allied war effort. &quot;A swift victory over the main armies in the main theatre of war was the German General Staff&#x27;s solution for all outside difficulties, and absolved them from thinking of war in its wider aspects.&quot;

The General Staff mistakenly predicted that China would win the First Sino-Japanese War.

====Organization====
The General Staff was divided between the central &quot;Großer Generalstab&quot; in Berlin and the general staffs of the corps and division HQs. The head of the &quot;Großer Generalstab&quot; was the &quot;Chief of the General Staff&quot; and was also the technical superior of all general staff officers. The Chief of the General Staff&#x27;s chief deputy held the title of &quot;Generalquartiermeister&quot;. Beneath them were the five &quot;Oberquartiermeisters&quot;, who supervised the heads of the General Staff departments. The Railroad Department had the largest number of officers assigned, while the Second Department was the most important.

===World War I===
In August 1914, following the pre-war mobilization plan, most of the General Staff, including the &quot;Oberquartiermeisters&quot;, were reassigned to the headquarters of the Armies and Corps. The remaining core became the &quot;General Staff of the Field Army&quot;, part of the &quot;Oberste Heeresleitung&quot; (OHL, Supreme Army Command). The General Staff was streamlined into only three departments; Operations, Intelligence and Political Affairs.

The need for the system was promptly demonstrated when Supreme Commander Kaiser Wilhelm II proposed to concentrate against Russia, not France. Chief of the General Staff Helmuth von Moltke the Younger and Generalquartiermeister, Hermann von Stein convinced him that this was unthinkable because the thousands of orders could not be quickly rewritten and because the French with their quicker mobilization and excellent railways would be attacking a German border in force long before the Russians. One of the eight German Armies was commanded by Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, paired with Konstantin Schmidt von Knobelsdorf, a senior general staff officer the kaiser instructed his thirty-two-year-old son: &quot;whatever he advises you must do&quot;. The system also removed uncertainty about the competence of Army Commanders Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria and Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg, though both were well-trained soldiers. Other armies were commanded by highly experienced staff officers, for example Paul von Hindenburg was given command of the Eighth Army, the only one facing the Russians invading East Prussia, with Erich Ludendorff as chief of staff.

The interactions between a commander and his chief of staff were elucidated by a successful practitioner of both roles, Hans von Seeckt
The decision is taken in private, and when the two men come out, there is only one decision. They have amalgamated it; they share one mind with each other. Should the opinions have differed, in the evening of this happy day in a military marriage the two halves will no longer know who gave in. The outside world and military history will not have knowledge of a domestic quarrel. The competence of command and control is based on this fusion of the two personalities. It does not matter if the order bears the commander&#x27;s signature, or if the Chief of Staff has signed it for the High Command (today &#x27;For the commander&#x27;) according to our old custom. The commander always issues his orders through his Chief of Staff, and even the most senior subordinate leader must submit himself to his orders without objection, because his orders will always be given on behalf of the supreme commander.

The Schlieffen Plan was scuttled when the shaken Moltke ordered the German right wing in France to retire during the First Battle of the Marne. Soon Moltke was replaced by Erich von Falkenhayn who was already the Prussian war minister. After failing to dislodge the Entente in Flanders, he put the Western Front on the defensive. He was replaced at the war ministry in early 1915, and in 1916 Hindenburg and Ludendorff took over as advisers to the supreme commander. They led &quot;OHL&quot; in aggressively intervening in German political and economic life, changing the original goal of defending Germany&#x27;s borders to conquest and expansion. A consequence of wartime attrition was the premature deployment of &quot;Kriegsakademie&quot; students to army and corps general staffs, some of them before reaching their second year curriculum. Later, standards for General Staff assignment were altered due to the closure of the &quot;Kriegsakademie&quot;, to allow examined officers to serve as staff apprentices, raising concerns that these new General Staff Corps officers were not evaluated or trained at the level of those they were replacing.

Superior German staff work at division, corps and army level throughout the war was a major contributor to their run of successes. At the beginning of 1918 having defeated the Russians Hindenburg and Ludendorff resolved to win in the west. Tactically, their staff work was brilliant. Using only weapons that had failed at Verdun, they devised a long, comprehensive list of measures to smash through enemy field fortifications, which were then taught to all ranks in the attacking units. The German Army had tactical success during the Spring Offensive, but the Allies held strategic points. They were sure that a series of successful breakthroughs would snap their enemy&#x27;s resolve, ignoring the fact that each victory sapped German strength, while their foes were continually strengthened by Americans flooding into France. The Germans were overwhelmed during the Hundred Days Offensive, and eventually agreed to an Armistice of 11 November 1918 with the Allies.

===Interwar period===
The victors&#x27; fear was encapsulated by the clause in the Treaty of Versailles: &quot;The Great German General Staff and all similar organisations shall be dissolved and may not be reconstituted in any form.&quot; The German Army was limited to 4,000 officers. The Weimar Republic″s armed forces, the Reichswehr, was led by Hans von Seeckt. He camouflaged the General Staff by renaming it the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; (&quot;troop office&quot;), and selected many General Staff officers to fill the available places. The War Academy (&quot;Kriegsakademie&quot;) was abolished, but training of General Staff officers continued, dispersed among the &quot;Wehrkreise&quot; (Military District) headquarters but overseen by tutors from the &quot;Truppenamt&quot;. General Staff officers continued to play major roles in the nation, most strikingly when former chief of staff Paul von Hindenburg was elected Reichspräsident in 1925.

When Adolf Hitler became Reichskanzler in 1933, he instructed the Truppenamt/General Staff to ignore the Versailles restrictions; he would create a greatly expanded Wehrmacht, including the Army, the Navy, and a new Air Force. A new War Academy (&quot;Kriegsakademie&quot;) was established in 1935. The General Staff advised Hitler that the Army could not be fully modernized until 1944 or 1945. When Hitler went to war in 1939, the tank columns were still followed by horse-drawn artillery pieces. Throughout the war, German industry was unable to furnish small arms in sufficient quantities, forcing the Army to rely heavily on older weapons, prizes of war, and adaptations of former designs produced in conquered countries, thus producing an arsenal filled with an array of incompatible pieces, unlike the smaller variety of standard small arms used by the Allies.

Initially, the Army&#x27;s leaders feared that their leading role as the defenders of Germany would be usurped by the unruly SA, the Nazi party&#x27;s political militia. When Hitler suppressed the SA in the Night of the Long Knives, the army stood aside and effectually acquiesced in the extrajudicial murders involved, including those of army officers. While the General Staff welcomed Hitler&#x27;s expansion of the army, they were opposed to many of his wilder schemes and continually urged caution. When several of Hitler&#x27;s early moves such as the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the Anschluss with Austria and the occupation of the Sudetenland succeeded despite advice from the General Staff that these might bring about a premature war with France and Britain, Hitler was further convinced that his intuition was superior to the General Staff&#x27;s intellectual analysis.

When Hindenburg died, the Army replaced their oath to the constitution with one to the Führer Adolf Hitler. Hitler was soon able to curtail the Army&#x27;s traditional independence, by the fortuitous disgrace of the commander in chief of the armed forces, Werner von Blomberg, and false accusations of homosexuality against the commander in chief of the army, Werner von Fritsch. (The combined scandals were known as the Blomberg–Fritsch affair.)

The armed forces command structure was changed by Hitler in 1938, with an Armed Forces HQ (the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot;, usually contracted to &quot;OKW&quot;) placed over the army command (&quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; or &quot;OKH&quot;) and the other service commands, and almost entirely displacing the Reich War Ministry. However, OKW from its inception had generally weaker, more pliant staff officers than OKH and the Luftwaffe. A weakness of both the &quot;Kriegsakademie&quot; curriculum and General Staff doctrine was that it focused primarily on tactical and operational matters. There was no institution comparable to the United States National War College or the British Imperial Defence College where higher-ranking officers of all services could study wider economic, political and diplomatic issues related to broad strategy.

Since commanders were no longer selected by pedigree, the chiefs of staff were no longer joint commanders. Their role was The commander must be supported by obedient, independent and critical advising General Staff officers (&quot;Fuehrergehilfen&quot;). They provide him with information and advice, prepare decisions, turn them into orders and measures and supervise their execution. If necessary, they urge the commander to decide and act. Their thinking and actions must be guided by his will and intentions and must be determined by his decisions and orders.

===World War II===

Towards the end of the War of 1914 to 1918, the General Staff had almost wholly usurped the political power of the state. At the beginning of World War II, by contrast, its influence was less than it had been at the outset of the First World War and actually declined during the war.

In part this was due to the increasing pre-eminence of the other branches of the German armed forces, in particular of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The commander in chief of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, Hitler&#x27;s friend and political colleague Hermann Göring, always had personal influence with Hitler which no Army leader had. Another was the increasing tension between OKH and OKW. While the need for a joint headquarters to coordinate the work of all the services was desirable in theory, for example to determine industrial and manpower priorities and avoid duplication of effort, OKW was increasingly used as an alternate Army planning staff by Hitler. At the same time, OKW failed in its task of overseeing the overall war effort, resulting in wasteful diversion of resources to several competing and unregulated forces (such as the SS) responsible only to themselves or to Hitler alone.

After 1941, OKH was largely responsible for operations on the Eastern Front only (and administration of the army as a whole), while OKW directed operations on the other fronts. There were now effectively two general staffs, often competing with each other, with arbitration of all disputes in the hands of Hitler, further increasing his personal power. Finally, in late 1941, Hitler dismissed Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch, the commander in chief of the Army, and assumed direct command of the Army himself. From this time onwards, neither OKW nor OKH could independently plan or conduct operations, but merely implemented Hitler&#x27;s often flawed commands.

At a lower level, training of General Staff officers continued, but the course was still almost as long, intense, and exclusive as in peacetime. Properly-trained staff officers became increasingly scarce, and in some cases newly qualified staff officers lacked the dedication or moral courage of their predecessors.

====20 July plot====

Before and during the early part of the war, some General Staff officers, notably the Chief, Franz Halder, considered a coup d&#x27;état to remove Hitler from power, and avoid what they believed would be a disastrous and premature war. They planned a coup as response to Hitler ordering war on Czechoslovakia to seize the Sudetenland, when Britain and France were opposed. But France and Britain capitulated at Munich, which removed the danger of war and justified Hitler&#x27;s policy; the dissidents let the matter drop. In November 1939, Halder, still fearing the war would end in disaster, discussed a coup with Army C-in-C von Brauchitsch and Carl Goerdeler of the Schwarze Kapelle, but finally decided Hitler was untouchable until Germany met a &quot;setback&quot;.

Opposition to Hitler nevertheless continued, including among the General Staff officers of the &quot;Ersatzheer&quot; (&quot;Replacement Army&quot;), which had charge of all new troops being organized in Germany for the field army. They set up &quot;Operation Valkyrie&quot;, in which &quot;Ersatzheer&quot; detachments would take control of Germany. On 20 July 1944, the conspirators tried to kill Hitler, thought they had succeeded, and initiated &quot;Valkyrie&quot;. But most line officers and the bulk of the General Staff refused to obey the &quot;Valkyrie&quot; plotters; when Hitler was known to be alive, the coup collapsed entirely.

However, many General Staff officers were clearly implicated in the plot, and the General Staff was revealed as a center of dissent. In the months after 20 July, several dozen General Staff officers were arrested and in most cases executed. Also, Luftwaffe, SS, or &quot;National Socialist Leadership Officers&quot; were appointed to positions normally occupied by General Staff officers in new or rebuilt formations.

==Bundeswehr==

On May 15, 1957, the first chief of staff of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, General Heusinger, spoke at the opening of the new Army Academy (&quot;Heeresakademie&quot;), pointing out that General Staff officers are &quot;the defenders and guardians of the values of German military tradition&quot;, extending back 147 years. German students are admitted to the Army Academy after studying at a Federal Armed Forces University (&quot;Universität der Bundeswehr&quot;) in Hamburg or Munich, followed by several years of line duty. Officers from other NATO countries are their classmates. The academy also teaches a 10-month Army General Staff Officer Course for officers from non-NATO countries.

In the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; there are General Staff officers, but no General Staff officer branch or corps. The chief of staff of the Federal Armed Forces is the supreme military representative of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; and the principal military adviser to the Government. In the event of war the Federal Republic of Germany is the only NATO country which immediately relinquishes operational command over all combat units of her armed forces to NATO commanders. Hence the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; does no operational defense planning, which was the classic task of former German General Staffs. Therefore, the role of the General Staff officer is as the adviser to an operational commander, &quot;his main task is to advise his commander in all matters, and he is entitled to the commander&#x27;s attention&quot;.

Most General Staff officers are graduates of the Federal Armed Forces Command and General Staff Academy (&quot;Führungsakademie&quot;) in Hamburg. General Staff officers are rotated through line commands to keep them familiar with everyday unit problems. General Staff officers are identified by crimson facings on their uniforms and by inserting &quot;i. G.&quot; (&quot;im Generalstabsdienst&quot;) after their rank. Less than four per cent of officers are members of the General Staff. There are five General Staff officers in each &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; division. At the headquarters of Allied Forces Central Europe in Brunssum Netherlands there are roughly one hundred German officers, but only seventeen are General Staff officers.

The &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; retains the German army&#x27;s tradition of mission-oriented command and control (&quot;Auftragstaktik&quot;). Moreover, &quot;lower-rank officers are frequently superiors of higher-rank officers&quot;.

<text>Rossby waves, also known as planetary waves, are a type of inertial wave naturally occurring in rotating fluids. They were first identified by Sweden-born American meteorologist Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in 1939. They are observed in the atmospheres and oceans of Earth and other planets, owing to the rotation of Earth or of the planet involved. Atmospheric Rossby waves on Earth are giant meanders in high-altitude winds that have a major influence on weather. These waves are associated with pressure systems and the jet stream (especially around the polar vortices). Oceanic Rossby waves move along the thermocline: the boundary between the warm upper layer and the cold deeper part of the ocean.

==Rossby wave types==
===Atmospheric waves===
Atmospheric Rossby waves result from the conservation of potential vorticity and are influenced by the Coriolis force and pressure gradient. The image on the left sketches fundamental principles of the wave, e.g., its restoring force and westward phase velocity. The rotation causes fluids to turn to the right as they move in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. For example, a fluid that moves from the equator toward the north pole will deviate toward the east; a fluid moving toward the equator from the north will deviate toward the west. These deviations are caused by the Coriolis force and conservation of potential vorticity which leads to changes of relative vorticity. This is analogous to conservation of angular momentum in mechanics. In planetary atmospheres, including Earth, Rossby waves are due to the variation in the Coriolis effect with latitude. 

One can identify a terrestrial Rossby wave as its phase velocity, marked by its wave crest, always has a westward component. However, the collected set of Rossby waves may appear to move in either direction with what is known as its group velocity. In general, shorter waves have an eastward group velocity and long waves a westward group velocity.

The terms &quot;barotropic&quot; and &quot;baroclinic&quot; are used to distinguish the vertical structure of Rossby waves. Barotropic Rossby waves do not vary in the vertical, and have the fastest propagation speeds. The baroclinic wave modes, on the other hand, do vary in the vertical. They are also slower, with speeds of only a few centimeters per second or less.

Most investigations of Rossby waves have been done on those in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.
Rossby waves in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere are easy to observe as (usually 4–6) large-scale meanders of the jet stream. When these deviations become very pronounced, masses of cold or warm air detach, and become low-strength cyclones and anticyclones, respectively, and are responsible for day-to-day weather patterns at mid-latitudes. The action of Rossby waves partially explains why eastern continental edges in the Northern Hemisphere, such as the Northeast United States and Eastern Canada, are colder than Western Europe at the same latitudes, and why the Mediterranean is dry during summer (Rodwell–Hoskins mechanism).

====Poleward-propagating atmospheric waves====
Deep convection (heat transfer) to the troposphere is enhanced over very warm sea surfaces in the tropics, such as during El Niño events. This tropical forcing generates atmospheric Rossby waves that have a poleward and eastward migration.

Poleward-propagating Rossby waves explain many of the observed statistical connections between low- and high-latitude climates. One such phenomenon is sudden stratospheric warming. Poleward-propagating Rossby waves are an important and unambiguous part of the variability in the Northern Hemisphere, as expressed in the Pacific North America pattern. Similar mechanisms apply in the Southern Hemisphere and partly explain the strong variability in the Amundsen Sea region of Antarctica. In 2011, a &quot;Nature Geoscience&quot; study using general circulation models linked Pacific Rossby waves generated by increasing central tropical Pacific temperatures to warming of the Amundsen Sea region, leading to winter and spring continental warming of Ellsworth Land and Marie Byrd Land in West Antarctica via an increase in advection.

====Rossby waves on other planets====

Atmospheric Rossby waves, like Kelvin waves, can occur on any rotating planet with an atmosphere. The Y-shaped cloud feature on Venus is attributed to Kelvin and Rossby waves.

===Oceanic waves===
Oceanic Rossby waves are large-scale waves within an ocean basin. They have a low amplitude, in the order of centimetres (at the surface) to metres (at the thermocline), compared with atmospheric Rossby waves which are in the order of hundreds of kilometres. They may take months to cross an ocean basin. They gain momentum from wind stress at the ocean surface layer and are thought to communicate climatic changes due to variability in forcing, due to both the wind and buoyancy. Off-equatorial Rossby waves are believed to propagate through eastward-propagating Kelvin waves that upwell against Eastern Boundary Currents, while equatorial Kelvin waves are believed to derive some of their energy from the reflection of Rossby waves against Western Boundary Currents. 

Both barotropic and baroclinic waves cause variations of the sea surface height, although the length of the waves made them difficult to detect until the advent of satellite altimetry. Satellite observations have confirmed the existence of oceanic Rossby waves.

Baroclinic waves also generate significant displacements of the oceanic thermocline, often of tens of meters. Satellite observations have revealed the stately progression of Rossby waves across all the ocean basins, particularly at low- and mid-latitudes. Due to the beta effect, transit times of Rossby waves increase with latitude. In a basin like the Pacific, waves travelling at the equator may take months, while closer to the poles transit may take decades.

Rossby waves have been suggested as an important mechanism to account for the heating of the ocean on Europa, a moon of Jupiter.

===Waves in astrophysical discs===
Rossby wave instabilities are also thought to be found in astrophysical discs, for example, around newly forming stars.

== Amplification of Rossby waves ==

It has been proposed that a number of regional weather extremes in the Northern Hemisphere associated with blocked atmospheric circulation patterns may have been caused by quasiresonant amplification of Rossby waves. Examples include the 2013 European floods, the 2012 China floods, the 2010 Russian heat wave, the 2010 Pakistan floods and the 2003 European heat wave. Even taking global warming into account, the 2003 heat wave would have been highly unlikely without such a mechanism.

Normally freely travelling synoptic-scale Rossby waves and quasistationary planetary-scale Rossby waves exist in the mid-latitudes with only weak interactions. The hypothesis, proposed by Vladimir Petoukhov, Stefan Rahmstorf, Stefan Petri, and Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, is that under some circumstances these waves interact to produce the static pattern. For this to happen, they suggest, the zonal (east-west) wave number of both types of wave should be in the range 6–8, the synoptic waves should be arrested within the troposphere (so that energy does not escape to the stratosphere) and mid-latitude waveguides should trap the quasistationary components of the synoptic waves. In this case the planetary-scale waves may respond unusually strongly to orography and thermal sources and sinks because of &quot;quasiresonance&quot;.

A 2017 study by Mann, Rahmstorf, et al. connected the phenomenon of anthropogenic Arctic amplification to planetary wave resonance and extreme weather events.

==Mathematical definitions==
===Free barotropic Rossby waves under a zonal flow with linearized vorticity equation===

To start with, a zonal mean flow, &quot;U&quot;, can be considered to be perturbed where &quot;U&quot; is constant in time and space. Let formula_1 be the total horizontal wind field, where &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are the components of the wind in the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;- directions, respectively. The total wind field can be written as a mean flow, &quot;U&quot;, with a small superimposed perturbation, &quot;u′&quot; and &quot;v′&quot;.

:formula_2

:formula_3

The perturbation is assumed to be much smaller than the mean zonal flow.

:formula_4

The relative vorticity formula_5 and the perturbations formula_6 and formula_7 can be written in terms of the stream function formula_8 (assuming non-divergent flow, for which the stream function completely describes the flow):

: formula_9

Considering a parcel of air that has no relative vorticity before perturbation (uniform &quot;U&quot; has no vorticity) but with planetary vorticity &quot;f&quot; as a function of the latitude, perturbation will lead to a slight change of latitude, so the perturbed relative vorticity must change in order to conserve potential vorticity. Also the above approximation &quot;U&quot; » &quot;u&quot;&#x27; ensures that the perturbation flow does not advect relative vorticity.

:formula_10

with formula_11. Plug in the definition of stream function to obtain:

:formula_12

Using the method of undetermined coefficients one can consider a traveling wave solution with zonal and meridional wavenumbers &quot;k&quot; and &quot;ℓ&quot;, respectively, and frequency formula_13:

:formula_14

This yields the dispersion relation:

:formula_15

The zonal (&quot;x&quot;-direction) phase speed and group velocity of the Rossby wave are then given by

:formula_16

where &quot;c&quot; is the phase speed, &quot;c&quot;&quot;g&quot; is the group speed, &quot;U&quot; is the mean westerly flow, formula_17 is the Rossby parameter, &quot;k&quot; is the zonal wavenumber, and &quot;ℓ&quot; is the meridional wavenumber. It is noted that the zonal phase speed of Rossby waves is always westward (traveling east to west) relative to mean flow &quot;U&quot;, but the zonal group speed of Rossby waves can be eastward or westward depending on wavenumber.

===Rossby parameter===
The Rossby parameter is defined as the rate of change of the Coriolis frequency along the meridional direction:

:formula_18

where formula_19 is the latitude, &quot;ω&quot; is the angular speed of the Earth&#x27;s rotation, and &quot;a&quot; is the mean radius of the Earth.

If formula_20, there will be no Rossby waves; Rossby waves owe their origin to the gradient of the tangential speed of the planetary rotation (planetary vorticity). A &quot;cylinder&quot; planet has no Rossby waves. It also means that at the equator of any rotating, sphere-like planet, including Earth, one will still have Rossby waves, despite the fact that formula_21, because formula_22. These are known as Equatorial Rossby waves.

<doc id="438610" wikidata="Q7852677" url="?curid=438610" title="Tumor hypoxia">
<text>Tumor hypoxia is the situation where tumor cells have been deprived of oxygen. As a tumor grows, it rapidly outgrows its blood supply, leaving portions of the tumor with regions where the oxygen concentration is significantly lower than in healthy tissues. Hypoxic microenvironments in solid tumors are a result of available oxygen being consumed within 70 to 150 μm of tumor vasculature by rapidly proliferating tumor cells thus limiting the amount of oxygen available to diffuse further into the tumor tissue. In order to support continuous growth and proliferation in challenging hypoxic environments, cancer cells are found to alter their metabolism. Furthermore, hypoxia is known to change cell behavior and is associated with extracellular matrix remodeling and increased migratory and metastatic behavior.

==Changes in the glycolytic pathway==

A particular change in metabolism, historically known as the Warburg effect results in high rates of glycolysis in both normoxic and hypoxic cancer cells. Expression of genes responsible for glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters are enhanced by numerous oncogenes including RAS, SRC, and MYC.

===HIF-1 induced changes in gene expression===
During cancer progression, tumor cells acquire comprehensive metabolic reprogramming, and tissue hypoxia is a prominent feature of solid tumors leading to cell metabolism adaptive changes. Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a key oxygen-regulated transcriptional activator, playing a fundamental role in the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxia by upregulating the transcription of target genes related to multiple biological processes, including cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis and anti-apoptosis. Significant HIF1A expression has been noted in most solid tumors studied, which include cancers of the gastric and colon.

These genes include: solute carrier family 2 (GLUT1), hexokinase (HK), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), phosphofructokinase (PFKL), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDO), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), enolase 1 (ENOA), pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 1 (PDK1) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A).

In addition to alterations in oxygen concentration associated with hypoxic microenvironments, glucose concentration gradients found in tumors also influence the rate of aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis. A carbohydrate-response element (ChoRE) is responsible for regulating glycolytic enzyme gene expression in response to changing glucose concentrations through a binding interaction at the same consensus sequence as HIF-1. Interactions of HIF-1 and ChoRE with the DNA sequence 5’-RCGTG-3’ leads to increased expression of genes listed above.

===GLUT1 transporter expression===

GLUT1 is a member of the GLUT transporter family of 14 hexose transporters responsible for facilitating the transport of hexose sugars along the concentration gradient. GLUT1 is the most abundantly expressed of the family thought to maintain basal glucose transport in almost all cell types. GLUT1 levels, in response to hypoxic conditions, have been shown to increase with changes at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, transport of GLUT1 has been shown to increase under these hypoxic conditions. With the role of transporting sugars from the extracellular to the intracellular environment, GLUT1, along with other members of the GLUT family, can be rate-controlling for cellular glycolytic metabolism. Having an increased level of GLUT1, in the case of hypoxic tumors, increases the flux of glucose into the cells allowing for a higher rate of glycolysis and thus greater risks of metastasis (as elaborated upon below).

===Hexokinase 2 expression===

Hexokinase (HK) is the first enzyme in the glycolytic pathway converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate through an ATP-dependent phosphorylation event. Important for glycolysis to proceed, the hexokinase reaction activates glucose for subsequent steps. In hypoxic tumors, hexokinase mRNA abundance is significantly increased as well as protein levels. Increased expression of hexokinase 2, in some cases nearly 10-fold, allows for an increased flux of glucose through the glycolytic pathway subsequent to the increased uptake by GLUT1.&lt;

===Phosphoglucose isomerase expression===

Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is a housekeeping cytosolic enzyme with roles in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. It is responsible for catalyzing the interconversion of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. Extracellularly, PGI is known as an autocrine motility factor (AMF) eliciting mitogenic, motogenic, differentiation functions as well as tumor progression and metastasis. Activation of PGI through proposed HIF-1 induced mechanisms results in increased conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and also contributes to cell motility and invasion during cancer metastasis.

===6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatases expression===
6-Phosphofructo-2-kinases/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFBs) belong to a family of bifunctional ATP-dependent enzymes responsible for controlling the level of glycolysis intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. HIF-1-induced expression of these enzymes (PFK-2/FBPase-2) subsequently alters the balance of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate which plays an important role as an allosteric activator of phospho-fructokinase 1 (PFK-1). PFK-1 is an enzyme that controls one of the most critical steps of glycolysis. Regulation of PFK-1 is also mediated by the cellular energy status in result of ATP&#x27;s inhibitory effect. Greater quantities of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in cancer cells, in result of HIF-1 expression of PFK-2/FBPase-2, thus activates PFK-1allowing for an increased glycolytic flux converting fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Allosteric regulation of glycolysis by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate allows cancer cells to maintain a glycolytic balance to match their bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands.

=== Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase expression ===

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDO) belongs to a family include aldolase A, B and C. Unique in glycolysis, aldolase enzymes cleave fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two 3-C molecules including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). With the HIF-1 mediated expression of aldolase A under hypoxic conditions, the catalysis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate is increased thus leading to increased glycolytic flux.

===Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression===

The glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is responsible for the oxidative conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GADP) to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPG). Up-regulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression is maximal (4-5 fold) following hypoxic conditions of ~24 hours in vascular endothelial cells. Various models for the exact glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activation mechanisms have been proposed.

===Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 expression===

Hypoxia has been shown to induce a 10-fold accumulation of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK-1) mRNA in mouse hepatoma (Hepa 1c1c7) cells. Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 is an enzyme involved in the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-P-G) leading the production of ATP from ADP. Induction of gene expression by HIF-1 is thought to be dependent on the presence of aromatic hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT1). Arnt&#x27;s N-terminal region and HIF-1 are thought to work together to induce transcription of phosphoglycerate kinase 1.

===Phosphoglycerate mutase expression===

Phosphoglycerate mutase B (PGM-B) is one of the latter glycolytic enzymes responsible for the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG). Both protein and mRNA levels were shown to increase 2-3-fold in research exposing fetal rat lung fibroblasts to hypoxic conditions. Increased levels appeared to be regulated at the transcriptional level as per many of the other glycolytic enzymes. Maximum up regulation was shown following 16 hours thus supporting its role in contributing to an increased glycolytic flux for adaption of cells to hypoxia.

===Enolase 1 expression===

Enolase 1, also known as α-enolase, is encoded by the ENOA gene and is responsible for converting 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the glycolytic pathway. Both enolase 1 overexpression and its post-translational modifications could be of value for diagnostic and prognostic work in terms of cancer. Although the exact roles of post-translational modifications have not been completely elucidated, patterns are shown between certain cancer cell types suggesting they may have important influence on function, localization and immunogenicity. Aside from its role in promoting glycolytic flux and anaerobic energy production, it has been shown to induce a specific humoral and cellular immune response. On all levels, hypoxia-induced over-expression of enolase 1 may possess important roles in hypoxic tumors including the most straightforward increase in anaerobic respiration.

=== Pyruvate kinase expression ===

HIF-1 activated pyruvate kinase M comes in multiple isoforms known as PKM1 and PKM2. Pyruvate kinase is shown to convert phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate forming ATP from ADP. Along with phospho-fructokinase 1, pyruvate kinase is also allosterically activated by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. In cancer cells pyruvate kinase M2 has been shown to interact directly with HIF-1α enhancing HIF-1 binding and p300 recruitment to hypoxia response elements. This positive feedback loop leads to HIF-1 transactivation and an amplified effect on glucose metabolism.

Pyruvate kinase M2 is often considered the main regulator of cancer metabolism with roles in various parallel, feed-forward, positive and negative feedback mechanisms. The genetic difference between pyruvate kinase M1 and pyruvate kinase M2 is only 22 out of 531 amino acids which makes an immense difference. Pyruvate kinase M2 has metabolic activity regulated by post-translational modifications including acetylation, oxidation, phosphorylation, hydroxylation and sumoylation. These different modifications can cause the shift from the metabolically active tetrameric form to the in-active monomeric form. The well-known EGFR-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and death-associated protein kinase are both shown to bind and directly phosphorylate pyruvate kinase M2 leading to increased activity in the glycolysis pathway. In hypoxic conditions found in a solid tumor, pyruvate kinase M2 plays a large role in promoting anaerobic energy production.

=== Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase expression ===
Pyruvate dehydrogenase directly follows the glycolytic pathway and is responsible for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA which enters into the TCA cycle. The TCA cycle, although not directly requiring oxygen, requires the cycling of NADH to NAD+ as performed by the electron transport chain under aerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, such as those found in hypoxic tumors, the TCA cycle provides little ATP yield due to the lack of electron transport chain function. In order to direct the glycolytically produced pyruvate away from the TCA cycle, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase is over-expressed in response to hypoxic conditions. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase is not a glycolytic enzymes but more of a glycolytic regulator. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, transcriptionally activated by HIF-1 in hypoxic conditions, are responsible for phosphorylating the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase ultimately suppressing its function. By inhibiting this specific pathway, the glycolytic products are directed away from the mitochondrial TCA cycle and towards lactate dehydrogenase.

=== Lactate dehydrogenase expression ===

Activated expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), parallels with deactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase mediated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Subsequent inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase following phosphorylation and increased expression of lactate dehydrogenase A shunts pyruvate away from the mitochondrial TCA cycle. In many different tumor types lactate dehydrogenase A is found at elevated levels and has even been linked to poor prognosis and a greater metastatic potential The high levels of lactate production surface the question of whether lactate has some influence on the aggressive behaviour shown in hypoxic tumors.

=== Overview of glycolytic changes and consequences ===
Increased expression of almost every glycolytic enzyme is seen in hypoxic tumor conditions. The over-expression of these proteins is mediated by HIF-1 and completely alters normal cellular metabolism. With decreases in the rate of mitochondrial oxidation, lactate and protons begin to accumulate. High levels of glycolysis and the production of lactate, as shown in hypoxic tumor cells, is hallmark of cancer cells even in the presence of oxygen.

To relieve tumors cells of acidosis, carbonic anhydrases appear to be highly expressed once again downstream of HIF-1 activation. These enzymes catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide into bicarbonate and protons. They also assist in acidifying the extracellular environment and maintaining a slightly alkaline intracellular compartments contributing to tumor cell survival. Lactate from the hypoxic tumor cells is excreted to the surrounding environment by carbonic anhydrase 9 and sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 MCT4. Local aerobic cancer cells are thought to take up this lactate forming a metabolic symbiosis.

== Lactate and cancer ==
It is commonly accepted that cancer cells (both hypoxic and normoxic) produce large amounts of lactate in result of a large metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to altered glycolysis. The high levels of released lactate contribute to immune escape for the tumor cells. Activated T cells use glycolysis as an energy source and thus must regulate their own lactate levels. Traditionally done by a secretion method, immune cells in a lactate rich environment cannot rid themselves of their own lactate due to the concentration gradient. It is thought that leukocytes may be asphyxiated by lactate while low extracellular pHs may also reduce cytotoxic T-cell function.

In endothelial cells it has also been shown that lactate stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production leading to enhanced cellular migration in result of lactate-induced angiogenesis Recent work has also uncovered that lactate uptake by MCT-1 in endothelial cells stimulates NF-κB activation and thus IL-8 expression. Release of lactate from tumor cells through MCT-4 was sufficient to stimulate angiogenesis and tumor growth through an IL-8-dependent mechanism.

Lactate has demonstrated the ability to increase hyaluronan production leading to elevated expression of CD44. Hyaluronan is a glycosaminoglycan polymer critical for maintaining extracellular matrix integrity and modulating cell-cell interactions. Hyaluronan is tethered to cell surfaces by CD44 which are anchored in caveolin-rich lipid rafts. Cleavage and further degradation of hyaluronan is facilitated by Hyal2 and Hyal1, respectively. Increased levels of hyaluronan surrounding carcinomas leads to the promotion of cellular growth and motility. A lactate-sensitive response element for genes in fibroblasts involved in hyaluronan metabolism has been identified.

Finally, it is also worth noting that lactate concentrations are positively correlated with radioresistance. Many anti-cancer therapies, including ionizing radiation and many chemotherapeutics, rely on the overproduction of reactive oxygen species to cause genomic instability. Lactate, as an antioxidant, may act to scrub down the levels of reactive oxygen species thus enhancing resistance to radiation and chemotherapy.

== Acidic microenvironment and metastasis ==

It is thought that the low pH of hypoxic tumors in result of high levels of lactic acid can promote tumor cell invasion by destruction of adjacent non-cancerous tissue. Carbonic anhydrase 9 involved in maintaining a slightly alkaline intracellular pH does so by removing carbonate from the extracellular space consequently acidifying the cells surroundings. Moreover, proton pumping from the hypoxic tumor cells further decreases the surrounding pH. On a completely different note, as briefly discussed above, the autocrine function of phosphoglucose isomerase also promotes cell motility and metastasis.

== Metabolic symbiosis ==

With the hypoxic tumor cells consuming large amounts of glucose to maintain energy homeostasis, the tumor has found a way of using its resources most efficiently. The end glycolytic product of hypoxic tumors, lactate, is transported out of the hypoxic cell by monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) which is a hypoxia-induced transporter. The free lactate in the extracellular space is then taken up by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) which is a non-hypoxia induced transporter found on the surface of aerobic cells. This transporter allows aerobic cancer cells to efficiently take up lactate, convert it back to pyruvate with the oxygen-dependent expression of lactate dehydrogenase B (LDH-B), and use it as an energy source. This frees these cells from requiring large quantities of glucose allowing the hypoxic cells to take up the majority of the available resources.

Tumor cells have also shown the remarkable ability to adapt to regional variation of oxygen availability. Cancer cells demonstrate the ability to be hypoxic at one point in time and aerobic at the next. This shows cyclic variations in oxygenation implying dynamic regulation of the metabolic symbiosis between lactate-producing and lactate-consuming states.

== The pentose phosphate pathway ==

In order to meet the demands of rapid tumor growth, the tumor must find ways to support the synthesis of a complete daughter cell while facing depleting nutrient supplies. They must coordinate production of precursors for macromolecular synthesis as well as maintain cellular bioenergetics without impairing cell growth, proliferation and viability. One way of doing this is by shuffling glycolytic intermediates such as glucose-6-phosphate into the pentose phosphate pathway to give ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH. Ribose-5-phosphate acts as an intermediate for the production of nucleotides thus providing a connection between glycolysis and nucleotide synthesis in hypoxic tumor cells. In cases where glycolysis remains highly active in normoxic conditions, NADPH acts as a mediator of antioxidative reactions to protect cells from oxidative damage.

==Cancer treatments and tumor hypoxia==

=== Radiotherapy ===

The presence or absence of oxygen has a strong influence on ionizing radiation to cause cell death of tumor and normal cells. This is called the oxygen effect. Under hypoxic conditions it has been shown that cells obtain radioresistance through HIF-1 mediated mechanisms. To overcome this problem, radiation oncologists have developed powerful tools and approaches such as simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiation therapy (SIB-IMRT), which enables a booster dose of radiation to be delivered to small target fractions in a malignant tumor, hypoxia-selective cytotoxins/drugs, and HIF-1 inhibitors.
Moreover, it is possible to treat a hypoxic tumor by means of ion beam therapy, in particular with carbon ions. As ions&#x27; damage is direct, OER (Oxygen Enhancement Ratio) is 1, so the effect of oxygen it is not important.

An important approach of hypoxia-related treatment interventions is a procedure called dose painting, in which a higher radiation dose is targeted to hypoxic subvolumes of tumor. However, one of the major challenges is a lack of clinically applicable method to detect tumor hypoxia. Accordingly, the evaluation of non-invasive hypoxia detection methods, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been a subject of intense research for several years. PET imaging is the preferred method in clinical use, and the most investigated PET radiotracers for imaging of tumor hypoxia are 18F-FMISO, 18F-EF5, 18F-FAZA and 18F-HX4. The feasibility of hypoxia PET based dose painting is already being evaluated in a few interventional clinical trials.

===Other treatment options===
Bioreductive prodrugs play a significant part in dealing with these kinds of cells: they can kill the oxygen-deficient tumor cells selectively as hypoxia-activated prodrugs. Example drugs include Tirapazamine and Evofosfamide. The study of tumors in such conditions was pioneered by Dr L. H. Gray.

== Targeting tumor hypoxia to overcome metastasis ==

An association between tumor hypoxia and metastatic progression has been shown through numerous publications.

==Drug development==
Several approaches have been taken to address tumor hypoxia. Some companies tried to develop drugs that are activated in hypoxic environments (Novacea, Inc. Proacta, Inc, Convert Pharmaceuticals, and Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc), while others are currently seeking to reduce tumor hypoxia (Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and NuvOx Pharma, LLC). 

Several companies have tried to develop drugs that are activated in hypoxic environments. These drug candidates target levels of hypoxia that are common in tumors but are rare in normal tissues. The hypoxic zones of tumors generally evade traditional chemotherapeutic agents and ultimately contribute to relapse. In the literature, hypoxia has been demonstrated to be associated with a worse prognosis, making it a determinant of cancer progression and therapeutic response Several review articles summarize the current status of hypoxic cytotoxins (hypoxia activated prodrugs). Companies that have tried drugs that are activated in hypoxic environments included Novacea, Inc. Proacta, Convert Pharmaceuticals and Threshold Pharmaceuticals. Novacea Inc discontinued development of its hypoxia activated drug. Proacta&#x27;s drug PR610 failed a Phase I clinical trial due to toxicity. Threshold Pharmaceuticals discontinued the hypoxia activated prodrug, TH-302, after Phase III trials failed to show statistically significant overall survival.

As of 2025, Convert Pharmaceuticals&#x27;s CP506, a DNA Alkylating agent, seems to be the only hypoxia activated prodrug ongoing clinical trials.

Niacinamide, the active form of vitamin B3, acts as a chemo- and radio-sensitizing agent by enhancing tumor blood flow, thereby reducing tumor hypoxia. Niacinamide also inhibits poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP-1), enzymes involved in the rejoining of DNA strand breaks induced by radiation or chemotherapy. As of August 2016, no clinical trials appear to be in progress for this indication.

Another approach to the treatment of tumor hypoxia is the use of an oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound to reoxygenate the hypoxic zones of tumors. The developer of oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, tested its lead compound, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC), in a Phase II clinical trial in 59 patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme. The results of the Phase II showed that 36% of the full-dose TSC patients were alive at 2 years, compared with historical survival values ranging from 27% to 30% for the standard of care. The main endpoint of the trial was survival at two years, not overall survival.

Another drug in development that is designed to reduce tumor hypoxia is NuvOx Pharma&#x27;s NVX-108. NVX-108 is a formulation of the perfluorocarbon, dodecafluoropentane (DDFPe). NVX-108 is injected intravenously, flows through the lungs and picks up oxygen, then flows through the arteries and releases oxygen in the presence of hypoxic tissue. A Phase Ib/II clinical trial is in progress for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Early results have shown reversal of tumor hypoxia, and the trial continues to progress.

Another approach to target hypoxia is to use nanoparticles coated or loaded with specific targeting moieties. Although hyaluronic acid CD44 pathway to target cancer and cancer metastasis has been investigated before; Almoustafa et al. demonstrated that targeting CD44 receptors with Hyaluronic acid coated nanoparticles reduced drug resistance to doxorubicin compared to free drug and to non-targeted nanoparticles. However, more preclinical research should be conducted using hypoxia modeling in vitro and in vivo.

<text>The Congress of Berlin (13 June – 13 July 1878) was a diplomatic conference to reorganise the states in the Balkan Peninsula after the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), which had been won by Russia against the Ottoman Empire. Represented at the meeting were Europe&#x27;s then six great powers: Russia, Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Germany; the Ottomans; and four Balkan states: Greece, Serbia, Romania and Montenegro. The congress concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Berlin, replacing the preliminary Treaty of San Stefano which had been signed three months earlier.

The leader of the congress, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, sought to stabilise the Balkans, reduce the role of the defeated Ottoman Empire in the region, and balance the distinct interests of Britain, Russia and Austria-Hungary. He also wanted to avoid domination of the Balkans by Russia or the formation of a Greater Bulgaria, and to keep Constantinople in Ottoman hands. Finally, Bismarck wanted to encourage the development of civil rights for Jews in the region.

The affected territories were instead granted varying degrees of independence. Romania became fully independent, though was forced to give part of Bessarabia to Russia, and gained Northern Dobruja. Serbia and Montenegro were also granted full independence but lost territory, with Austria-Hungary occupying the Sanjak of Novi Pazar along with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Britain took possession of Cyprus. Of the territory that remained within the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria was made a semi-independent principality, Eastern Rumelia became a special administration, and the region of Macedonia was returned to the Ottomans on condition of reforms to its governance.

The results were initially hailed as a success for peace in the region, but most of the participants were not satisfied with the outcome. The Ottomans were humiliated and had their weakness confirmed as the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;. Russia resented the lack of rewards, despite having won the war that the conference was supposed to resolve, and felt humiliated by the other great powers in their rejection of the San Stefano settlement. Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece all received far less than they thought they deserved, especially Bulgaria which was left with less than half of the territory envisioned by the Treaty of San Stefano. Bismarck became hated by Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists, and later found that he had tied Germany too closely to Austria-Hungary in the Balkans. Although Austria-Hungary gained substantial territory, this angered the South Slavs and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, culminating in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

In the long term, the settlement led to rising tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary, and disputes over nationalism in the Balkans. Grievances with the results of the congress festered until they exploded in the First and Second Balkan Wars (1912 and 1913 respectively). Continuing nationalism in the Balkans was one of the causes of the First World War in 1914.

==Background==
In the decades leading up to the congress, Russia and the Balkans had been gripped by Pan-Slavism, a movement to unite all the Balkan Slavs under one rule. The Treaty of San Stefano, which had created a &quot;Greater Bulgaria&quot;, was opposed as a display of Pan-Slavic hegemonic ambition in southeastern Europe. In Imperial Russia, Pan-Slavism meant the creation of a unified Slavic state, under Russian direction, and was essentially a byword for Russian conquest of the Balkan peninsula. The realisation of the goal would have given Russia control of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, thus economic control of the Black Sea and substantially greater geopolitical power. Pan-Germanism and Pan-Italianism reflected similar nationalist desires and had resulted in two unifications; it took different forms in the various Slavic nations. 

Balkan Slavs felt they needed both an equivalent to Piedmont to serve as a base and an outside sponsor corresponding to France. The state that was meant to serve as the locus for unification of the Balkans under a &quot;Slavic&quot; rule was not always clear, as initiative wafted between Serbia and Bulgaria. Italian rhetoric by contrast cast Romania as Latin, a &quot;second Piedmont&quot;.

The recognition of the Bulgarian Exarchate by the Ottomans in 1870 had been intended to separate the Bulgarians, religiously from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, and politically from Serbia. Pan-Slavism required the end of Ottoman rule in the Balkans. How and whether that goal would be realised was the major question to be answered at the Congress of Berlin.

==Great powers in the Balkans==
The Balkans were a major stage for competition between the European great powers in the second half of the 19th century. Britain and Russia had interests in the fate of the Balkans. Russia was interested in the region, both ideologically, as a pan-Slavist unifier, and practically, to secure greater control of the Mediterranean. Britain was interested in preventing Russia from accomplishing its goals. Furthermore, the Unifications of Italy and of Germany had stymied the ability of a third European power, Austria-Hungary, to expand its domain to the southwest any further. Germany, as the most powerful continental nation since the 1871 Franco-Prussian War had little direct interest in the settlement and so was the only power that could mediate the Balkan question credibly.

Russia and Austria-Hungary, the two powers that were most invested in the fate of the Balkans, were allied with Germany in the conservative League of Three Emperors, which had been founded to preserve the monarchies of Continental Europe. The Congress of Berlin was thus mainly a dispute among supposed allies of Bismarck. The German Empire, the arbiter of the discussion, would thus have to choose before the end of the congress which of their allies to support. That decision was to have direct consequences on the future of European geopolitics.

Ottoman brutality in the Serbian–Ottoman War and the violent suppression of the Herzegovina Uprising fomented political pressure within Russia, which saw itself as the protector of the Serbs, to act against the Ottoman Empire. David MacKenzie wrote that &quot;sympathy for the Serbian Christians existed in Court circles, among nationalist diplomats, and in the lower classes, and was actively expressed through the Slav committees&quot;.

Eventually, Russia sought and obtained Austria-Hungary&#x27;s pledge of benevolent neutrality in the coming war, in return for ceding Bosnia Herzegovina to Austria-Hungary in the Budapest Convention of 1877. act: The Berlin Congress in effect postponed resolution of the Bosnian question and left Bosnia and Herzegovina under Habsburg control. This was the goal of Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Count Gyula Andrássy.

==Treaty of San Stefano==


After the Bulgarian April Uprising in 1876 and the Russian victory in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Russia had liberated almost all of the Ottoman European possessions. The Ottomans recognised Montenegro, Romania and Serbia as independent, and the territories of all three of them were expanded. Russia created a large Principality of Bulgaria as an autonomous vassal of the sultan. That expanded Russia&#x27;s sphere of influence to encompass the entire Balkans, which alarmed other powers in Europe. Britain, which had threatened war with Russia if it occupied Constantinople, and France did not want another power meddling in either the Mediterranean or the Middle East, where both powers were prepared to make large colonial gains. Austria-Hungary desired Habsburg control over the Balkans, and Germany wanted to prevent its ally from going to war. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck thus called the Congress of Berlin to discuss the partition of the Ottoman Balkans among the European powers and to preserve the League of Three Emperors in the face of the spread of European liberalism.

The Congress was attended by Britain, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the Ottoman Empire. Delegates from Greece, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro attended the sessions that concerned their states, but they were not members.

The Congress was solicited by Russia&#x27;s rivals, particularly Austria-Hungary and Britain, and was hosted in 1878 by Bismarck. It proposed and ratified the Treaty of Berlin. The meetings were held at Bismarck&#x27;s Reich Chancellery, the former Radziwill Palace, from 13 June to 13 July 1878. The congress revised or eliminated 18 of the 29 articles in the Treaty of San Stefano. Furthermore, by using as a foundation the Treaties of Paris (1856) and of Washington (1871), the treaty rearranged the East.

==Other powers&#x27; fear of Russian influence==
The principal mission of the participants at the Congress was to deal a fatal blow to the burgeoning movement of pan-Slavism. The movement caused serious concern in Berlin and even more so in Vienna, which was afraid that the repressed Slavic nationalities would revolt against the Habsburgs. The British and the French governments were nervous about both the diminishing influence of the Ottoman Empire and the cultural expansion of Russia to the south, where both Britain and France were poised to colonise Egypt and Palestine. By the Treaty of San Stefano, the Russians, led by Foreign Minister Alexander Gorchakov, had managed to create in Bulgaria an autonomous principality, under the nominal rule of the Ottoman Empire.

That sparked the Great Game, the massive British fear of the growing Russian influence in the Middle East. The new principality, including a very large portion of Macedonia as well as access to the Aegean Sea, could easily threaten the Dardanelles Straits, which separate the Black Sea from the Mediterranean Sea. 

The arrangement was not acceptable to the British, who considered the entire Mediterranean to be a British sphere of influence and saw any Russian attempt to gain access there as a grave threat to British power. On 4 June, before the Congress opened on 13 June, British Prime Minister Lord Beaconsfield had already concluded the Cyprus Convention, a secret alliance with the Ottomans against Russia in which Britain was allowed to occupy the strategically-placed island of Cyprus. The agreement predetermined Beaconsfield&#x27;s position during the Congress and led him to issue threats to unleash a war against Russia if it did not comply with Ottoman demands. 

Negotiations between Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Andrássy and British Foreign Secretary Marquess of Salisbury had already &quot;ended on 6 June by Britain agreeing to all the Austrian proposals relative to Bosnia-Herzegovina about to come before the congress while Austria would support British demands&quot;.

==Bismarck as host==

The Congress of Berlin is frequently viewed as the culmination of the battle between Alexander Gorchakov of Russia and Otto von Bismarck of Germany. Both were able to persuade other European leaders that a free and independent Bulgaria would greatly improve the security risks posed by a disintegrating Ottoman Empire. According to historian Erich Eyck, Bismarck supported Russia&#x27;s position that &quot;Turkish rule over a Christian community (Bulgaria) was an anachronism which undoubtedly gave rise to insurrection and bloodshed and should therefore be ended&quot;. He used the Great Eastern Crisis of 1875 as proof of growing animosity in the region.

Bismarck&#x27;s ultimate goal during the Congress of Berlin was not to upset Germany&#x27;s status on the international platform. He did not wish to disrupt the League of the Three Emperors by choosing between Russia and Austria as an ally. To maintain peace in Europe, Bismarck sought to convince other European diplomats that dividing up the Balkans would foster greater stability. One reason that Bismarck was able to mediate the various tensions at the Congress of Berlin was his diplomatic persona. He sought peace and stability when international affairs did not pertain to Germany directly. Since he viewed the current situation in Europe as favourable for Germany, any conflicts between the major European powers that threatened the status quo was against German interests. Also, at the Congress of Berlin, &quot;Germany could not look for any advantage from the crisis&quot; that had occurred in the Balkans in 1875. Therefore, Bismarck claimed impartiality on behalf of Germany at the Congress, which enabled him to preside over the negotiations with a keen eye for foul play.

Though most of Europe went into the Congress expecting a diplomatic show, much like the Congress of Vienna, they were to be sadly disappointed. Bismarck, unhappy to be conducting the Congress in the heat of the summer, had a short temper and a low tolerance for malarky. Thus, any grandstanding was cut short by the testy German chancellor. The ambassadors from the small Balkan territories whose fate was being decided were barely even allowed to attend the diplomatic meetings, which were between mainly the representatives of the great powers.

According to Henry Kissinger, the congress saw a shift in Bismarck&#x27;s Realpolitik. Until then, as Germany had become too powerful for isolation, his policy was to maintain the League of the Three Emperors. Now that he could no longer rely on Russia&#x27;s alliance, he began to form relations with as many potential enemies as possible.

== Legacy ==
Owing to Russia&#x27;s insistence, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro were all given the status of independent principalities. Russia recovered Southern Bessarabia, which it had annexed at the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812, and lost to Moldavia/Romania in 1856, after the end of the Crimean War. The Bulgarian state that Russia had created by the Treaty of San Stefano was divided into the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, both of which were given nominal autonomy, under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Bulgaria was promised autonomy, and guarantees were made against Turkish interference, but they were largely ignored. Romania received Northern Dobruja as a compensation for Southern Bessarabia, but even so it did not benefit of substantial gain of territory despite its consistent war effort alongside Russia. Romanians deeply resented the loss of Southern Bessarabia and Russo-Romanian relationship remained very cold for decades. Montenegro obtained Nikšić, along with the primary Albanian regions of Podgorica, Bar and Plav-Gusinje. The Ottoman government, or Porte, agreed to obey the specifications contained in the Organic Law of 1868 and to guarantee the civil rights of non-Muslim subjects. The region of Bosnia-Herzegovina was handed over to the administration of Austria-Hungary, which also obtained the right to garrison the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, a small border region between Montenegro and Serbia. Bosnia and Herzegovina were put on the fast track to eventual annexation. Russia agreed that Macedonia, the most important strategic section of the Balkans, was too multinational to be part of Bulgaria and permitted it to remain under the Ottoman Empire. Eastern Rumelia, which had its own large Turkish and Greek minorities, became an autonomous province under a Christian ruler, with its capital at Philippopolis. The remaining portions of the original &quot;Greater Bulgaria&quot; became the new state of Bulgaria.

In Russia, the Congress of Berlin was considered to be a dismal failure. After finally defeating the Turks despite many past inconclusive Russo-Turkish wars, many Russians had expected &quot;something colossal&quot;, a redrawing of the Balkan borders in support of Russian territorial ambitions. Instead, the victory resulted in an Austro-Hungarian gain on the Balkan front that was brought about by the rest of the European powers&#x27; preference for a stronger Austria-Hungarian Empire, which threatened basically no one, to a powerful Russia, which had been locked in competition with Britain in the so-called Great Game for most of the century. Gorchakov said, &quot;I consider the Berlin Treaty the darkest page in my life&quot;. Many Russians were furious over the European repudiation of their political gains, and though there was some thought that it represented only a minor stumble on the road to Russian hegemony in the Balkans, it actually gave Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia over to Austria-Hungary&#x27;s sphere of influence and essentially removed all Russian influence from the area.

The Serbs were upset with &quot;Russia... consenting to the cession of Bosnia to Austria&quot;:

Italy was dissatisfied with the results of the Congress, and the tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire were left unresolved. Bosnia-Herzegovina would also prove to be problematic for the Austro-Hungarian Empire in later decades. The League of the Three Emperors, established in 1873, was destroyed since Russia saw lack of German support on the issue of Bulgaria&#x27;s full independence as a breach of loyalty and the alliance. The border between Greece and Turkey was not resolved. In 1881, after protracted negotiations, a compromise border was accepted after a naval demonstration of the great powers had resulted in the cession of Thessaly and the Arta Prefecture to Greece.

Two states that didn&#x27;t participate in the war, Great Britain and Austria-Hungary, achieved great benefits from this Congress. The former was granted administrative control of Cyprus in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression. The latter obtained the administration of Bosnia-Herzegovina and secured the control of a corridor leading to the Aegean Sea. Both of these territories had to remain de jure part of the Ottoman Empire, but in 1914 the British Empire formally annexed Cyprus, whereas Bosnia-Herzegovina was annexed by Austria in 1908.

Thus, the Berlin Congress sowed the seeds of further conflicts, including the Balkan Wars and (ultimately) the First World War. In the &#x27;Salisbury Circular&#x27; of 1 April 1878, the British Foreign Secretary, the Marquess of Salisbury, clarified the objections of him and the government to the Treaty of San Stefano because of the favorable position in which it left Russia.

In 1954, the British historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote:

Though the Congress of Berlin constituted a harsh blow to Pan-Slavism, it, by no means, solved the question of the area. The Slavs in the Balkans were still mostly under non-Slavic rule, split between the rule of Austria-Hungary and the ailing Ottoman Empire. The Slavic states of the Balkans had learned that banding together as Slavs benefited them less than playing to the desires of a neighboring great power. That damaged the unity of the Balkan Slavs and encouraged competition between the fledgling Slav states.

The underlying tensions of the region would continue to simmer for thirty years until they again exploded in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913. In 1914, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, the Austro-Hungarian heir, led to the First World War. In hindsight, the stated goal of maintaining peace and balance of powers in the Balkans obviously failed since the region would remain a source of conflict between the great powers well into the 20th century.

==Internal opposition to Andrássy&#x27;s objectives==
Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Andrássy and the occupation and administration of Bosnia-Herzegovina also obtained the right to station garrisons in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, which remained under Ottoman administration. The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to Salonika that &quot;would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence&quot;. &quot;High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired... [an] immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective&quot;.

On 28 September 1878 the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to resign if the army, behind which stood the Archduke Albert, were allowed to advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution by his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion was lost by 179 to 95. By the Opposition rank and file the gravest accusations were raised against Andrassy.

<text>Carol Harris-Shapiro is a lecturer at Temple University in the Intellectual Heritage Department. She has written a controversial book on Messianic Judaism, a belief system considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity, adhered to by groups that seek to combine Christianity and Judaism.

She received her rabbinical ordination at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in 1988, and religiously affiliates with Reconstructionist Judaism. She received a Ph.D. in religion from Temple University in 1992. In the past she has taught at Villanova University, La Salle University, Philadelphia University, Rosemont College, and Gratz College.

She looks at religion from a sociological standpoint, and sees that although Jewish community as a whole accepts Secular Humanistic Jews and Jewish Buddhists as still being &quot;in the fold,&quot; Messianic Jews are considered to be heretics. It was this puzzle in the behavior of the Jewish community—accepting atheist and Buddhist Jews, while rejecting Jews practicing Christianity—that led her to explore the Messianic Jewish community in a focused ethnographic study and to think through the issue of legitimacy surrounding Messianic Judaism.

==Book controversy==
Her book &quot;Messianic Judaism: A Rabbi&#x27;s Journey through Religious Change in America&quot; has been the focus of a controversy. She concludes that given the Jewish community&#x27;s tacit acceptance of other seemingly &quot;heretical&quot; Jews as part of the ethnic Jewish community, it would be difficult to find a consistently logical reason to reject Messianic Judaism, although she is quite clear that communities can draw boundaries as they see fit. Theologically, she affirms that Messianic Jews are adherents of Evangelical Christianity.

This was reiterated in an interview with &quot;World: The Journal of the Unitarian Universalist Association&quot; (Nov/Dec 99), Harris-Shapiro reiterates that she views messianic Judaism as a form of Christianity.

:&quot;World: Describe the Christianity practiced by Messianic Jews and in particular their appropriation of Jesus.&quot;

:&quot;CHS: They practice evangelical Christianity. Like evangelical Christians, they believe Jesus was both God and man, came to earth, died for our sins, was resurrected on the third day, performed the miracles, and that the New Testament is literally true. Some also hold some fundamentalist beliefs about exactly how one interprets the New Testament. Some are very interested in the millennium, in prophecy, in when or if the rapture is going to happen. Many congregations, though not all, are Pentecostal—that is, they believe in gifts of the spirit such as speaking in tongues, charismatic healing, exorcising demons, and the real presence of Satan that has to be battled.&quot;

:&quot;As for how they see Jesus, that&#x27;s interesting. Although they accept the theological doctrine that Jesus is both God and human, they don&#x27;t pray to him. They don&#x27;t feel comfortable with that. Some Messianic rabbis have even had difficulty accepting Yeshua as God and have been kicked out of the movement.&quot;

The idea that &quot;messianic Judaism&quot; could be considered a form of Judaism has been rejected by the overwhelming majority of Jewish historians and rabbis. Reform Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations called her conclusions absurd, writing that &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as a &#x27;messianic Jew.&#x27; The whole notion is a fraud.…There will be no compromise on that point.&quot; In the same newspaper article on this book, Conservative Rabbi Jerome Epstein, vice president of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and Orthodox Rabbi Lawrence Shiffman, professor of Judaic Studies at New York University also stated that Harris-Shapiro was egregiously incorrect. Shiffman wrote that she &quot;has been sucked into the very conception the missionaries want to create.&quot; (Kessler, E. J. The Jewish Forward, June 4, 1999: page 1).

<doc id="438625" wikidata="Q374667" url="?curid=438625" title="Amyntas II of Macedon">
<text>Amyntas II (), also known as Amyntas &quot;the Little&quot;, was king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon for several months around 394/3 BC. He became king in July or August of 394/3 after the death of Aeropus II, but he was soon after assassinated by an Elimieotan nobleman named Derdas and succeeded by Aeropus&#x27; son Pausanias. 

He was likely the son of Menelaus, second son of Alexander I, but he could have also been the son of Archelaus. The most influential view, advanced by Historian Nicholas Hammond, is that Archelaus married his younger daughter to Amyntas or Amyntas&#x27; son in order to stave off a future power struggle with the line of Menelaus. The argument is based in part on a line from Aelian&#x27;s &quot;Varia Historia&quot; about an Amyntas being Menelaus&#x27; son. The alternative theory holds that the polygamous Archelaus married his son (Amyntas) to his daughter to cement the branch lines: a half-brother and a half-sister. 

Ptolemy of Aloros, future regent for Perdiccas III, was possibly the son of Amyntas and Archelaus&#x27; daughter, whose name is unknown. Diodorus simply refers to Ptolemy as a &quot;son of Amyntas,&quot; which Hammond argued must mean Amyntas II because all other sons of Amyntas III are accounted for. However, the relevant text is almost universally regarded as corrupt and might actually say “Ptolemy the Alorite fraudulently murdered the son of Amyntas, Alexander.”

When listing the kings of Macedonia, Diodorus omits Amyntas&#x27; reign, but all other ancient sources, as well as modern scholars, agree that he ruled before Pausanias.

<text>Lewis John Collins (23 March 1905 – 31 December 1982) was an Anglican priest who was active in several radical political movements in the United Kingdom.

==Life==
Educated at Cranbrook School, Kent, and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, Collins was ordained a priest in 1928 and served as chaplain of his old college and vice-principal of Westcott House, before becoming chaplain of Oriel College, Oxford, in 1937. He served as a chaplain in the Royal Air Force during World War II and was radicalised by the experience. In 1946, upon returning to Oxford, he founded the organization Christian Action to work for reconciliation with Germany. He was appointed as a canon of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, in 1948, an office he held for 33 years. Shortly afterwards he became disturbed by the newly developing apartheid system in South Africa.

In 1951, Collins was one of the four founders of the charity War on Want, which fights global poverty. In 1956, he committed Christian Action to raising funds for the defence of anti-apartheid activists accused of treason in South Africa and this gave rise to the Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa. The fund raised more than £75,000 to help defend the accused during the Treason Trial. Collins was strongly opposed to a proposed cricket tour by Frank Worrell&#x27;s West Indies to South Africa in 1959, leading a successful campaign to have it cancelled.

Collins was strongly opposed to the spread of nuclear weapons and was one of many on the left in Britain who believed that it was unnecessary and wrong for Britain to own such weapons. He was one of the founders of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He was also a member of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship, working with the Reverend Sidney Hinkes on anti-nuclear campaigns.

He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

The Canon Collins Educational &amp; Legal Assistance Trust, formerly known as Canon Collins Trust for Southern Africa (CCETSA) is a charity founded in 1981. It was set up as the Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa and Collins was its first chairman. In the days of apartheid it provided money to help South African and Namibian refugee students gain the higher education in the United Kingdom and in independent African states. It now provides scholarships for students within South Africa and in other African countries.

==Family==
Collins married Diana Clavering Elliot (1917–2003) in 1939; they had four sons, including the judge Andrew Collins. In 1999, Diana Collins was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

<text>Sherwin Theodore Wine (Hebrew name שמעון בן צבי, Shimon ben Tzvi; January 25, 1928 – July 21, 2007) was an American rabbi and a founding figure of Humanistic Judaism, a movement that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as sources of Jewish identity rather than belief in any gods. He was originally ordained as a Reform rabbi but later founded the Birmingham Temple, the first congregation of Humanistic Judaism, in 1963.

In 1969, Wine founded the Society for Humanistic Judaism (SHJ). He was later a founder of several other Humanistic Jewish organizations, and was the founder of several humanist organizations that are not specifically Jewish (such as the Humanist Institute and the International Association of Humanist Educators, Counselors, and Leaders) as well as the co-founder of Americans for Religious Liberty, which promotes separation of church and state. He was the provost of the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism at the time of his death.

Wine lectured on a wide array of topics after 1976 under the auspices of the Center for New Thinking, which he also founded. The American Humanist Association named him Humanist of the Year for 2003.

==Early life==
Wine was born in Detroit on January 25, 1928, the son of immigrant parents from Poland. His father, whose name was originally Herschel Wengrowski, joined family members in Detroit in 1906. His mother, Tieblei Israelski, emigrated to Detroit in 1914. Wine attended Detroit public schools with almost completely Jewish student bodies, and his religious upbringing was in Conservative Judaism at Congregation Shaarey Zedek. His parents kept a kosher home and observed Shabbat. Wine attended the University of Michigan, earning a BA and later an MA in philosophy. As an undergraduate student, he was most sympathetic to empiricism, particularly its then-current manifestation logical positivism. At the same time, he was attracted to the humanistic outlook of some faculty members.

==Career==
Despite his movement away from theism, Wine decided to join the clergy rather than academia and in 1951 enrolled in the rabbinic program at Reform Judaism&#x27;s Hebrew Union College. Wine volunteered for service as a chaplain in the U.S. Army after his ordination as a rabbi and served as associate rabbi at the Reform Temple Beth El in Detroit for six months while awaiting induction. Wine began his service as an Army chaplain in January 1957 and was stationed in Korea. In November 1958, he returned to Temple Beth El in Detroit. In the fall of 1959, he joined a group in Windsor, Ontario, just across the Detroit River in Canada to organize a new Reform congregation, also called Beth El.

In 1963, a disaffected group from Temple Beth El in Detroit contacted Wine and asked him to meet with them about forming a new Reform congregation in the northwestern suburbs of Detroit, where the members now lived. He began leading services for the new group, initially eight families, in September 1963 in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Working with members of this small group to develop language which reflected their true beliefs, Wine eventually made the decision to eliminate the word &quot;God&quot; from the services and instead to use new liturgy that extolled Jewish history, culture, and ethical values. This decision was to lay the foundation for the development of Humanistic Judaism as separate from Reform Judaism or any other existing Jewish stream.

A storm of controversy arose when it became known that Wine, who had by then left Temple Beth El in Windsor, was leading a congregation that did not recognize God. The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; ran an article in December 1964 with the headline &quot;Suburban Rabbi: &#x27;I Am an Atheist. This was followed by stories in &quot;Time&quot; magazine and the &quot;New York Times.&quot; Wine explained that his views were not precisely atheistic. Rather, reflecting his acceptance of the basic outlook of the logical positivists, he declared that it was not possible empirically to prove or disprove the existence of God and, therefore, the concept was meaningless. He referred to this stance as &quot;ignosticism&quot; rather than atheism or agnosticism.

The Masonic temple in Birmingham in which the congregation was meeting at the time expelled the group early in 1965 because it had rejected God. The congregation, now known as the Birmingham Temple, purchased land in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and moved into a newly constructed building in 1971. The Torah scroll was placed in the library rather than at the usual place in the sanctuary. Instead, the sanctuary was adorned with a large sculpture spelling out in Hebrew the word Adam, meaning &quot;man&quot; or &quot;people.&quot;

Wine served as the rabbi of the Birmingham Temple until his retirement in 2003, at which time he began devoting most of his efforts to his work as Dean for North America and Provost of the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism as well as to lecturing on a wide range of topics under the auspices of the Center for New Thinking, which he had founded in 1976. In 2003 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.

Wine&#x27;s last work, &quot;A Provocative People: The Secular History of the Jews&quot;, was published after his death. It was edited by his student Rabbi Adam Chalom.

As the outlook and practices of the Birmingham Temple attracted people in other locations, Wine assumed the responsibility for founding several organizations designed to link these adherents together.

First, in 1969, the Society for Humanistic Judaism was formed by Wine&#x27;s Birmingham Temple; a previously Reform congregation in Illinois headed by Rabbi Daniel Friedman, who had led the congregation from Reform to Humanistic Judaism after learning about Wine&#x27;s work in Michigan; and a congregation in Westport, Connecticut, which had been organized by a member of the Birmingham Temple who had moved to Connecticut. The Society for Humanistic Judaism now has over 30 constituent congregations in the United States and Canada, as well as individual members unaffiliated with any of these congregations.

To fulfill the need of the Humanistic Judaism movement for trained leaders, Wine founded the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism in 1985. This educational institution was sponsored jointly by the Society for Humanistic Judaism and the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations. The rabbinic program of this Institute has educated and ordained seven rabbis in North America in addition to over 50 leaders (called &quot;madrikhim &quot; or &quot;madrikhot &quot; in Hebrew or &quot;vegvayzer &quot; in Yiddish) who have less training than rabbis but are certified by the Institute to officiate at weddings and other life cycle events. The Institute also has an active rabbinical program in Israel from which eight rabbis have graduated and been ordained.

Wine also founded several organizations that are not specifically Jewish. In 1981, he and others created the Voice of Reason for the purpose of responding to the upsurge of right-wing political activism by religious leaders such as Rev. Jerry Falwell. In 1982, The Voice of Reason merged with the Center for Moral Democracy, which had been started by Ethical Culture leader Edward L. Ericson and others, to form a new organization, Americans for Religious Liberty, which continues as an advocacy group for the separation of church and state.

In 1982, Wine founded the North American Committee for Humanism, a confederation of the six major humanist organizations in North America, and The Humanist Institute, a graduate school in New York for training humanist leaders. Wine served as President of both of these organizations from 1982 until 1993.

In the Detroit area, Wine founded the Conference on Liberal Religion, an association of liberal religious professionals, in 1985 and an advocacy group called Clergy and Citizens United in 1995.

==Views==

While secular Jewish culture thrived in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, its principal manifestations, Yiddish-based schools and Zionism, were in decline by the beginning of the 1960s. Many nonreligious Jews were becoming unaffiliated with either religious or secular Jewish organizations. Recognizing that most Americans are members of thriving religious congregations, Wine concluded that a congregational format, emphasizing Jewish culture and history rather than a theistic outlook, could attract nonreligious Jews who were not served by other Jewish organizations. The goal was to provide members with a sense of community and all of the services that are provided by congregational life, but in a manner consistent with the nontheistic outlook of Wine and the others in his movement.

Wine emphasized intellectual integrity, keeping words consistent with beliefs. For him and his congregants, this meant that references to a deity had to be excluded from the liturgy. As a result, Wine discarded virtually all previous Jewish liturgical writings. A typical passage developed by Wine for the Sabbath (Shabbat) is, in transliterated Hebrew and in English:

Wine composed a poem that is considered to be the central expression of the outlook of Humanistic Judaism:



Many of the Jewish holidays have been maintained within Wine&#x27;s Humanistic Judaism, but the interpretations of the meanings of these holidays has been amended for consistency with the outlook of this movement. For example, Rosh Hashanah is said, within Humanistic Judaism, to be a time for renewal and reflection, focusing on the affirmation of human power and human dignity. Yom Kippur is, according to Wine and his movement, a celebration of inner strength and a time of self-forgiveness. Prayers and references to God are excluded from the services even for these holidays.

The Torah and other traditional Jewish religious texts are, for Wine, important historical documents that need to be evaluated scientifically to determine their origins and degree of factuality. For him, writings of the Jews of the past 250 years have more philosophical and ethical validity than ancient writings because they are more likely to be infused with the values of the Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment, and the more general Western Enlightenment.

Unlike other streams of Judaism, Humanistic Judaism does not condemn or discourage intermarriage, and its clergy are happy to officiate at weddings between Jews and non-Jews. Wine&#x27;s view has been that criticizing people for marrying whomever they choose is not only unethical but also counterproductive to efforts to ensure Jewish continuity. For Wine and Humanistic Judaism, Jewish identity is largely a matter of self-identification.

Wine has been closely affiliated with the non-Jewish Humanist movement. In responding to questions as to why a specifically Jewish organization should exist within Humanism, he has said that the history of the Jews is a clear demonstration that only people can solve human problems of survival and that there is no supernatural force that will come to our aid.

Wine has written numerous books and articles. His &quot;Judaism Beyond God &quot; is a description of the history and outlook of the Humanistic Judaism movement. &quot;Celebrations: A Ceremonial and Philosophic Guide for Humanists and Humanistic Jews&quot; is, as its name indicates, a compendium of Wine&#x27;s liturgical writings and &quot;meditations,&quot; intended for use at various holiday and life cycle ceremonies. &quot;Staying Sane in a Crazy World&quot; is a general self-help book, with advice on how reliance on reason can help us live meaningful and fulfilling lives.

Wine coined the word ignosticism. It is the view that a coherent definition of God must be presented before the question of the existence of God can be meaningfully discussed.

An openly gay man, Wine was also a member of Triangle Foundation&#x27;s Board of Advisors.

On July 21, 2007, Wine and his partner of more than 25 years Richard McMains were in a taxi headed to a hotel after dinner in Essaouira when their taxi was hit by another vehicle. Wine, aged 79, and the taxi driver were both killed instantly; McMains survived with serious injuries. A memorial service was held for him at a Presbyterian church.

<text>Jews for Judaism is an international organization that focuses on preventing Jews from converting to other faiths and reclaiming those who have already converted. It provides counseling services, education, and outreach programs to all Jewish denominations. It was established in 1985 by Rabbi Bentzion Kravitz.

The name Jews for Judaism was developed from &quot;Jews for Jesus&quot;, one of the principal missionary organizations it was founded to counteract. One of its prominent early members, Larry Levey, was a Jewish convert to Christianity who then converted back to Judaism and led the Baltimore office of Jews for Judaism for a number of years. In addition to its activities in response to Christian missionaries, Jews for Judaism has also been noted for its critiques of the Kabbalah Centre.

==Offices==
Jews for Judaism has two North American offices, located in Los Angeles, California, United States, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

===Directors===

*Los Angeles, California, United States: Rabbi Bentzion Kravitz.
*Toronto, Ontario, Canada: Julius Ciss, a former Messianic Jew.

==&quot;Be-True&quot;==
Jews for Judaism formed the student organization, &quot;Be-True&quot;, as a response to missionary activity on university campuses. The organization runs primarily through student representative volunteers. There are currently &quot;Be-True&quot; representatives in the United States, Canada, and Australia.

<text>Michael John Vanderjagt ( ; born March 24, 1970) is a Canadian former professional football placekicker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons, primarily with the Indianapolis Colts. He served as the Colts&#x27; placekicker from 1998 to 2005 and was a member of the Dallas Cowboys during his final NFL season in 2006. Prior to the NFL, Vanderjagt played four seasons in the Canadian Football League (CFL), three with the Toronto Argonauts and one with the Saskatchewan Roughriders.

During his CFL career, Vanderjagt won two Grey Cups and received the Dick Suderman Trophy in 1996. His most successful NFL season was in 2003 when he became the first kicker to convert every field goal and point after touchdown during the regular season and playoffs, earning him Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro honors. Vanderjagt retired as the NFL&#x27;s most accurate field goal kicker at 86.5%, which is the ninth-highest completion percentage in league history.

==Early life==
Vanderjagt attended White Oaks Secondary School, where he was a four sport athlete (football, basketball, track, and soccer). In 1988, he accepted a scholarship from Michigan State University as a quarterback and placekicker. However, he left Michigan State for Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, California, where he took over placekicking duties from exiting freshman Jack Garvin (who left to join UCLA).

Vanderjagt punted and played quarterback for AHC until returning to Division I football, as solely a punter and placekicker, at West Virginia University for the 1991 and 1992 seasons. As a junior, he was the team&#x27;s starting punter, registering 52 punts for 2,040 yards (39.2-yard avg.). In his final season he was switched to placekicker, ranking third in field goals made (15) and fourth in points scored (72) in the Big East Conference.

==Professional career==
===CFL 1993–1994, 1996–97===
After graduating from WVU in 1993, he returned to Canada and started a career in the Canadian Football League. Between 1993 and 1996, he was cut by four different CFL teams, getting some playing time with the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1993. Not playing in the league in 1994 or 1995, Vanderjagt played for the Tampa Bay Storm of the Arena Football League. Vanderjagt also played for the AFL&#x27;s Minnesota Fighting Pike in the 1996 season before returning to the Toronto Argonauts (who had previously cut him twice) for their 1996 season.

Over the next two seasons, Vanderjagt served as their regular placekicker and punter, as Argos won the Grey Cup in both 1996 and 1997; in those two games he was 9 of 9. For his 1996 Grey Cup efforts he was named the game&#x27;s outstanding Canadian. He also led the CFL in yardage per punt in 1997. Following the 1997 season, Vanderjagt left the Argos to become a free agent, ultimately to play in the National Football League.

===Indianapolis Colts===
In 1998, Vanderjagt returned to the United States to join the Indianapolis Colts of the NFL, and was the team&#x27;s placekicker through the 2005 season. He led the NFL in scoring in 1999.

In a 2000 playoff game against Miami, Vanderjagt successfully converted a 50-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, but missed a 49-yard attempt in overtime. Miami scored on the next possession to win the game.

Following the Colts&#x27; elimination from the postseason in 2002, Vanderjagt made critical comments about Colts quarterback Peyton Manning and head coach Tony Dungy to a Canadian television station. Vanderjagt questioned Manning&#x27;s leadership skills and criticized Dungy for being &quot;mild-mannered&quot;. During an interview at the 2003 Pro Bowl, Manning referred to Vanderjagt as the team&#x27;s &quot;idiot kicker&quot; and accused him of being intoxicated during the interview.

In 2003, Vanderjagt became the first kicker in the league&#x27;s history to go an entire season, including the playoffs, without missing a field goal or point-after attempt. (In 1998, Minnesota kicker Gary Anderson was perfect in the regular season, but missed a field goal attempt in the playoffs.) In the process, he made his first Pro Bowl and was named first-team All-Pro. He finished the regular season 37 for 37 in field goals and 46 for 46 in PATs. He was also perfect on three field-goal attempts and 12 PATs in the postseason. He did, however, miss a potential game tying 51-yard field goal in that season&#x27;s Pro Bowl with three seconds left in a 55–52 loss to the NFC.

In 2004, he kicked 20 field goals, the lowest number of his career. But he also had considerably fewer field goal chances that season (25), as the Colts offense scored 61 touchdowns (nearly four per game), with Peyton Manning throwing a then NFL record 49 TD passes.

Vanderjagt&#x27;s streak of 42 consecutive successful field goal attempts, the second longest in NFL history (the league does not include postseason or Pro Bowl games when compiling streaks), ended on September 9, 2004, when he missed a 48-yard attempt against the New England Patriots. The game was 2004&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; opener, which the Colts lost 27–24.

Vanderjagt indicated in a radio interview during the season that he might not return to the Colts for 2005, as his cap number was $2.8 million and the Colts might not be willing to pick up his salary for that season. He noted that he may return to the CFL, where his professional career began. However, he eventually signed a reworked deal and returned to the Colts.

In the 2005–06 NFL Playoffs, against the eventual Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers, Vanderjagt missed a 46-yard field goal attempt wide right with 18 seconds remaining, when the Colts were behind 21–18, costing the Colts a chance at overtime and ending the team&#x27;s season. Walking off the field after the kick, he took off his helmet and threw it to the ground in anger (which cost his team a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty). It was Vanderjagt&#x27;s first field goal miss in the RCA Dome in the postseason.

Shortly thereafter, on January 19, 2006, Vanderjagt appeared on a lighthearted segment of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, during which he successfully kicked a 46-yard field goal, outside Letterman&#x27;s Manhattan studio. Letterman, an Indiana native and Colts fan, served as the holder. The appearance was said to be one of the reasons why Vanderjagt was not re-signed in 2006.

During the 2006 offseason, Vanderjagt became a free agent and the Colts elected not to re-sign him. Instead, they signed free agent Adam Vinatieri, who had helped in the Patriots&#x27; recent Super Bowl titles. Following Vanderjagt&#x27;s departure, the Colts won Super Bowl XLI that season.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On March 23, 2006, the Cowboys signed Vanderjagt to a three-year, $4.5 million contract that included a $2.5 million signing bonus.

Vanderjagt suffered a groin injury that kept him out of action for two weeks in preseason. He returned for the final game against the Minnesota Vikings, but missed two field goals in overtime of 32 and 33 yards (both misses were wide right), forcing the contest to end in a tie. Rumors quickly spread that Vanderjagt would be released by the Cowboys before the start of the regular season, after head coach Bill Parcells was quoted saying, &quot;I think he has been a good kicker. But he keeps telling me that I don&#x27;t have to worry about him. Well, I&#x27;m worried about him now.&quot;

However, he remained on the roster, when the team was forced to keep backup kicker Shaun Suisham for the first game of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Vanderjagt appeared in each of the Cowboys&#x27; subsequent games through Week 12. In Week 9, his potential game-winning field goal was blocked by the Washington Redskins as time expired. In Week 11 against his former team the Colts, he missed his only two field goal attempts, (both of these misses were also wide right) making it the first time since 2001 since he had done so. The fans were so upset, they booed a commercial he appeared in on stadium monitors. After he barely made a 22-yard field goal against Tampa Bay, the Cowboys had seen enough. On November 27, he was released and replaced with Martín Gramática. During his time with the Cowboys, Vanderjagt made 13 of 18 field goal attempts and was 2-for-5 on field goals from 35 yards or more.

===Toronto Argonauts (second stint)===
On May 31, 2008, the Toronto Argonauts signed Vanderjagt and traded their veteran kicker Noel Prefontaine to the Edmonton Eskimos. Vanderjagt claimed he really wanted to return to Toronto and his hometown &quot;regardless of what NFL team called&quot; as he missed the sport, missed the area, and missed his friends and family, which include his wife Janalyn and their son Jay Michael. He was released by the Argonauts on his request on May 28, 2009.

==NFL career statistics==

==Personal life==
Vanderjagt appeared in a Walt Disney film called &quot;The Garbage Picking Field Goal Kicking Philadelphia Phenomenon&quot;, where he was the stand-in during football scenes for Tony Danza as a placekicker for the Philadelphia Eagles. He is currently the special teams coach for the Medina Mustangs in Medina, New York.

<text>Benjamin Sinclair Johnson, (born December 30, 1961) is a Canadian former sprinter. During the 1987–88 season he held the title of the world&#x27;s fastest man, breaking both the 100m and the 60m indoor World Records. He won the 100 metres at the 1987 World Championships in Athletics; and at the 1988 Summer Olympics, but was disqualified for doping and stripped of the gold medals.

He won two bronze medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics, as well as gold medals at the 1985 World Indoor Championships, 1986 Goodwill Games and 1986 Commonwealth Games. He was trained by Charlie Francis.

==Biography==

===Career background===

Benjamin Johnson was born in Falmouth, Jamaica, and emigrated to Canada in 1976, residing in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, Ontario.

Johnson met coach Charlie Francis and joined the Scarborough Optimists track and field club, training at York University. Francis was a Canadian 100 metres sprint champion himself (1970, 1971 and 1973) and a member of the Canadian team for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Francis was also Canada&#x27;s national sprint coach for nine years.

Johnson&#x27;s first international success came when he won 2 silver medals at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Australia. He finished behind Allan Wells of Scotland in the 100 metres with a time of 10.05 seconds and was a member of the Canadian 4 × 100 metres relay team which finished behind Nigeria. This success was not repeated at the 1983 World Championships in Helsinki, where he was eliminated in the semi-finals, finishing 6th with a time of 10.44, nor at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas where Johnson placed 5th in the 100 metres final with a time of 10.25.

At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he reached the 100 metres final; after a false start, he won the bronze medal behind Carl Lewis and Sam Graddy with a time of 10.22. He also won a bronze medal with the Canadian 4 × 100 m relay team of Johnson, Tony Sharpe, Desai Williams and Sterling Hinds, who ran a time of 38.70. By the end of the 1984 season, Johnson had established himself as Canada&#x27;s top sprinter, and on August 22 in Zürich, Switzerland, he bettered Williams&#x27; Canadian record of 10.17 by running 10.12.

In 1985, after eight consecutive losses, Johnson finally beat Carl Lewis. Other success against Lewis included the 1986 Goodwill Games, where Johnson beat Lewis, running 9.95 for first place, against Lewis&#x27; third-place time of 10.06. He broke Houston McTear&#x27;s seven-year-old world record in the 60 metres in 1986, with a time of 6.50 seconds. He also won Commonwealth gold at the 1986 games in Edinburgh, beating Linford Christie for the 100 metres title with a time of 10.07. Johnson also led the Canadian 4x100 metres relay team to gold, and won a bronze in the 200 metres. Also in 1986, Canadian sprinter Mike Dwyer expressed concern that the use of drugs had reached &quot;epidemic proportions&quot; among Canadian sprinters, particularly among those who trained in the Toronto area. Atlee Mahorn also speculated that many sprinters were on steroids.

On April 29, 1987, Johnson was invested as a Member of the Order of Canada. &quot;World record holder for the indoor 60-metre run, this Ontarian has proved himself to be the world&#x27;s fastest human being and has broken Canadian, Commonwealth and World Cup 100-metre records,&quot; it read. &quot;Recipient of the Norton Crowe Award for Male Athlete of the Year for 1985, &#x27;Big Ben&#x27; was the winner of the 1986 Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada&#x27;s top athlete.&quot;

By the time of the 1987 World Championships, Johnson had won his four previous races with Lewis and had established himself as the best 100 metres sprinter. At Rome, Johnson gained instant world fame and confirmed this status when he beat Lewis for the title, setting a new world record of 9.83 seconds as well, beating Calvin Smith&#x27;s former record by a full tenth of a second.

After Rome, Johnson became a lucrative marketing celebrity. According to coach Charlie Francis, after breaking the world record, Johnson earned about $480,000 a month in endorsements. Johnson won both the Lou Marsh Trophy and Lionel Conacher Award, and was named the Associated Press Athlete of the Year for 1987.

Following Johnson&#x27;s defeat of Lewis in Rome, Lewis started trying to explain away his defeat. He first claimed that Johnson had false-started, then he alluded to a stomach virus which had weakened him. Finally, without naming names, Lewis said &quot;There are a lot of people coming out of nowhere. I don&#x27;t think they are doing it without drugs.&quot; This was the start of Lewis&#x27; calling on the sport of track and field to be cleaned up in terms of the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs. While cynics noted that the problem had been in the sport for many years, they pointed out that it did not become a cause for Lewis until he was actually defeated, with some also pointing to Lewis&#x27;s egotistical attitude and lack of humility. During a controversial interview with the BBC, Lewis said:
There are gold medallists at this meet who are on drugs, that [100 metres] race will be looked at for many years, for more reasons than one.
Johnson&#x27;s response was:
When Carl Lewis was winning everything, I never said a word against him. And when the next guy comes along and beats me, I won&#x27;t complain about that either.
This set up the rivalry leading into the 1988 Olympic Games.

In 1988, Johnson experienced a number of setbacks to his running career. In February of that year he pulled a hamstring, and in May he aggravated the same injury. Meanwhile, in Paris in June, Lewis ran a 9.99. Then in Zurich, Switzerland on August 17, the two faced each other for the first time since the 1987 World Championships; Lewis won in 9.93, while Johnson finished third in 10.00. &quot;The gold medal for the (Olympic) 100 metres is mine,&quot; Carl Lewis said. &quot;I will never again lose to Johnson.&quot;

===Olympic Games and subsequent disqualification===
On September 24, 1988, Johnson won the 100 metres final at the Summer Olympics in Seoul, lowering his own world record to 9.79 seconds. He was the first Canadian sprinter since Percy Williams in 1928 to win the 100 metres at the Olympics. Johnson later remarked that he would have been even faster if he hadn&#x27;t raised his hand in the air just before he hit the tape.

However, Park Jong-sei of the Olympic Doping Control Center found that Johnson&#x27;s urine sample contained stanozolol, and he was disqualified three days after the race. He later admitted having used steroids when he ran his 1987 world record, which caused the IAAF to rescind that record as well. Johnson and coach Francis complained that they used performance-enhancing agents in order to remain on equal footing with the other top athletes. In testimony before the Dubin inquiry into drug use in sport, Francis charged that Johnson was only one of many cheaters, and he just happened to get caught. Often dubbed &quot;the dirtiest race in history,&quot; the 1988 100 m final had only two out of a total of eight runners who remained clean throughout their careers (Calvin Smith and Robson da Silva).

Johnson&#x27;s coach, Charlie Francis, a vocal critic of the IOC testing procedures, is the author of &quot;Speed Trap&quot;, which features Johnson heavily. In the book, he freely admits that his athletes were taking anabolic steroids, as he claims all top athletes at the time were, and also claims that Johnson could not possibly have tested positive for that particular steroid since Johnson actually preferred furazabol. He thought stanozolol made his body &quot;feel tight&quot;. The numerous athletes using performance-enhancing drugs at the time understood how long before a race, and possible drug test, they should stop using the drugs. Johnson later claimed that André A. Jackson, Lewis&#x27; Santa Monica Track Club teammate, who was inside the drug testing room in Seoul, may have placed the stanozolol in one of the beers Johnson drank in order to make urine for his test. He admitted he gave him beer. His response to the stanozolol blame: &quot;Of course I can say I didn&#x27;t. But I can also say I did, too. What&#x27;s the benefit?&quot;

During an interview on the Toronto Mike&#x27;d Podcast, Johnson said the fact he switched sponsorships from Adidas to Diadora may have been a factor in having his medal stripped. Johnson suggested Adidas athletes were more protected versus athletes aligned with smaller companies like Diadora.

On 28 September 2018, the Toronto Star ran an article on the lab report which was created on Johnson&#x27;s sample during the 1988 Olympic Games. It was produced by the IOC Doping Control Center in Seoul two days after Johnson handed in a urine sample taken after the 100m final. The newspaper concluded that the assumed substance Stanozolol was traceable, but &quot;inconsistencies&quot; are found in the report. The Toronto Star article goes on to state that no Canadian Olympic team official saw the lab report in Seoul. The lab report was requested by Canada&#x27;s chief medical officer, Dr. William Stanish. The Canadian team did not object after the IOC Medical Commission assured &quot;that its testing methods were unassailable.&quot;

====Canadian reaction====
Canadians initially rejoiced in the reflected glory of winning the gold medal and breaking the world record. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney watched Johnson set the new world record and after the race congratulated him over the phone. &quot;It&#x27;s a marvellous evening for Canada,&quot; Mulroney said in the televised conversation. Newspapers covered the occasion by concocting words such as &quot;Benfastic&quot; (&quot;Toronto Star&quot;, September 25, 1988) to describe it.

Two days later, Canadians witnessed the downfall of Johnson, when he was stripped of his gold medal and world record. Mark Tewksbury, a Canadian Olympic swimmer hung a bed sheet banner out of his Olympic Village apartment window expressing &#x27;Hero to Zero in 9.79&#x27;. In the first week following the disqualification, Canadian newspapers devoted several pages a day to the story. One headline right after the exposure asked &quot;Why, Ben?&quot; (&quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, September 26, 1988). Because of the Olympic scandal, the Canadian news agency &quot;Canadian Press&quot; named Johnson &quot;Newsmaker of the Year&quot; for 1988.

===Competitors implicated in doping controversies===

Johnson was not the only participant whose success was questioned: Carl Lewis had tested positive at the Olympic Trials for pseudoephedrine, ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. Lewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain &quot;Ma huang&quot;, the Chinese name for Ephedra (ephedrine is known to help weight loss). Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.

The highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to 10 parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances. According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed that &quot;These [levels] are what you&#x27;d see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.&quot;

Following Exum&#x27;s revelations the IAAF acknowledged that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration.

Linford Christie was found to have metabolites of pseudoephedrine in his urine after a 200m heat at the same Olympics, but was later cleared of any wrongdoing. Of the top five competitors in the race, only former world record holder and eventual bronze medalist Calvin Smith never failed a drug test during his career. Smith later said: &quot;I should have been the gold medalist.&quot;

====The Dubin Inquiry====
After the Seoul test, Johnson initially denied doping, but, testifying before the 1989 Dubin inquiry, a Canadian government investigation into drug abuse, he admitted that he had lied. Charlie Francis, his coach, told the inquiry that Johnson had been using steroids since 1981. Before that, his personal best (without drugs) was 10.25 which was good for a teenager back then, fast enough for third place in the Weltklasse Zürich meeting 1985 and 1986 for instance.

In Canada, the federal government established the Commission of Inquiry Into the Use of Drugs and Banned Practices Intended to Increase Athletic Performance, headed by Ontario Appeal Court Chief Justice Charles Dubin. The Dubin Inquiry (as it became known), which was televised live, heard hundreds of hours of testimony about the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs among athletes. The inquiry began in January 1989 and lasted 91 days, with 122 witnesses called, including athletes, coaches, sport administrators, IOC representatives, doctors and government officials.

===Comeback===
In 1991, after his suspension ended, he attempted a comeback. He returned to the track for the Hamilton Indoor Games in 1991 and was greeted by the largest crowd to ever attend an indoor Canadian track and field event. More than 17,000 people saw him finish second in the 50 metres in 5.77 seconds.

He failed to qualify for the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo but made the Canadian Olympic team again in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain after finishing second at the Canadian Olympic trials to Bruny Surin. He missed the 100 metre finals at the Olympics, however, finishing last in his semi-final heat after stumbling out of the blocks.

In 1993, he won the 50 metres on January 7 in Grenoble, France, in 5.65 seconds, just 0.04 seconds shy of the world record. However, he was again found guilty of doping just after the race – this time for excess testosterone – and was subsequently banned for life by the IAAF. Federal amateur sport minister Pierre Cadieux called Johnson a national disgrace, and suggested he consider moving back to Jamaica. Johnson commented that it was &quot;by far the most disgusting comment [he had] ever heard&quot;. In April 1999, a Canadian adjudicator ruled that there were procedural errors in Johnson&#x27;s lifetime ban and allowed him to appeal. The decision meant Johnson could technically run in Canada but nobody would compete against him. They would be considered &quot;contaminated&quot; by the IAAF and could also face sanctions. On June 12, 1999, Johnson entered a track meet in Kitchener, Ontario, and was forced to run alone, against the clock. He posted a time of 11.0 seconds. In late 1999, Johnson failed a drug test for the third time by testing positive for hydrochlorothiazide, a banned diuretic that can be used to mask the presence of other drugs. Johnson had not competed since 1993 and had arranged the test himself as part of his efforts to be reinstated.

In 1999, Johnson made headlines again when it was revealed that he had been hired by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to act as a personal trainer for his son, Al-Saadi Gaddafi, who aspired to join an Italian football club. Al-Saadi ultimately did join an Italian team but was sacked after one game when he failed a drug test. Johnson&#x27;s publicist in Canada had predicted in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that his training of the young Gaddafi would earn Johnson a Nobel Peace Prize.

===Late 1990s and beyond===
Johnson briefly acted as trainer for Argentine football player Diego Maradona in 1997. This occurred at York University, Toronto.

In 1998, Johnson appeared in a charity race in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, where he raced against a thoroughbred race horse, a harness racing horse and a stock car. Johnson finished third in the race.

According to a 1998 article in &quot;Outside&quot; magazine, Johnson spent much of the latter part of the 1990s living downstairs in the house he shared with his mother Gloria. He spent his leisure time reading, watching movies, and taking his mother to church. He lived in a spacious home in Newmarket, Ontario&#x27;s Stonehaven neighborhood. He claims to have lost his Ferrari when he used it as collateral for a loan from an acquaintance in order to make a house payment. His mother died of cancer in 2004 and Johnson lived with his sister afterwards.

Shortly after his leaving Libya, it was reported that Johnson had been robbed of $7,300 by a Romani gang in Rome. His wallet was taken, containing $7,300 in cash, the proceeds of his pay for training Gaddafi. Johnson gave chase, but was unable to catch them after they vanished into a metro station.

In May 2005, Johnson launched a clothing and sports supplement line, the &quot;Ben Johnson Collection&quot;. The motto for Johnson&#x27;s clothing line was &quot;Catch Me&quot;; however, the clothing line never caught on.

In a January 1, 2006 interview, Johnson claimed that he was sabotaged by a &quot;Mystery Man&quot; inside the doping control room immediately following the 100 metres final in Seoul. He also stated that 40% of people in the sports world are still taking drugs to improve their performance.

In August 2008, Johnson filed a $37 million lawsuit against the estate of his former lawyer Ed Futerman, claiming Futerman made unauthorized payments from his trust account to pay bills and 20 percent commissions to a hairdresser recruited by the lawyer to act as the sprinter&#x27;s sports agent. In 2012, the lawsuit was dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court by summary judgment on the basis that &quot;there were no genuine issues raised requiring a trial&quot;.

At present, Johnson lives in Markham, Ontario, and spends much of his time with his daughter and granddaughter. He also continues to coach, notably with New Jersey Devils defenceman P.K. Subban. In 2010, he released his autobiography entitled &quot;Seoul to Soul.&quot; In the self-published book, Johnson reviews his childhood in Jamaica, and his early bout with malaria. A Canadian Press article described the book as &quot;an unconventional sports autobiography.&quot;

=== Rivalry with Carl Lewis ===
The duels between the two competitors reached immense popularity, fans all over the world watched the duels with excitement. They matched 17 times. Lewis won the first eight, then Johnson won seven out of nine races. In all these years only one short verbal exchange between them is known. They were very different in various aspects. They came from different countries; one from Canada, one from the USA. While Ben grew up poor, Carl&#x27;s parents both went to college. Ben liked to party with his other rivals and had the reputation of a ladies&#x27; man; Carl on the other hand did not party often and was not as popular among the other athletes. Ben was incredible in the first 60 metres and had difficulties in the last 10 where Lewis was the fastest one. Carl benefited from his elegance and speed endurance whereas Johnson had impressive strength. He could bench press 165 kg, weighing only 72.

==Advertising career==
In March 2006, television spots featuring Johnson advertising an energy drink, &quot;Cheetah Power Surge&quot;, started to receive some airtime. Some pundits questioned whether Johnson was an appropriate spokesperson for an all natural energy drink considering his history of steroid use. One ad is a mock interview between Johnson and Frank D&#x27;Angelo, the president and chief executive of D&#x27;Angelo Brands, which makes the drink, in which he asks Johnson: &quot;Ben, when you run, do you Cheetah?&quot; &quot;Absolutely,&quot; says Johnson. &quot;I Cheetah all the time.&quot; The other commercial includes Johnson and a cheetah, the world&#x27;s fastest land animal, and encourages viewers to &quot;go ahead and Cheetah.&quot;

In May 2017, Johnson appeared in an advertising campaign for Australia&#x27;s leading mobile bookmaker, Sportsbet. The campaign launched Sportsbet&#x27;s new Android app, with Johnson cheekily saying it &quot;has tested positive for speed and power, again and again&quot;. The campaign tagline was &quot;Putting the &#x27;Roid in Android&quot; and concluded with Johnson in the starters&#x27; block on a racing track, telling punters to &quot;get on it!&quot; The advertisement was pulled after complaints from various parties.

==Documentaries==
The CBC Radio documentary series &quot;Rewind&quot; broadcast an episode titled &quot;Ben Johnson: A Hero Disgraced&quot; on September 19, 2013, for the 25th anniversary of the race, revealing 20 athletes tested positive for drugs but were cleared by the IOC at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. An International Olympic Committee (IOC) official told the CBC that endocrine profiles done at those games indicated that 80 percent of the track and field athletes tested showed evidence of long-term steroid use, although few were banned or had their medals stripped.

In October 2012, ESPN and the BBC dual-financed a documentary entitled &quot;9.79*&quot;, which explores the doping scandal of Ben Johnson at the 1988 Summer Olympic 100 metre final.

<text>Ale-8-One, colloquially Ale-8, is a ginger- and citrus-flavored soft drink bottled by the Ale-8-One Bottling Company in Winchester, Kentucky, United States. It is distributed primarily to brick and mortar retailers in Kentucky. 

==History==
The formula for Ale-8-One was developed by soda bottler G. L. Wainscott in the 1920s. Wainscott, who had been in the soda business in Winchester, Kentucky, since 1902, had developed Roxa-Kola, his previous flagship product, in 1906. In creating the formula for Ale-8-One, Wainscott drew upon his knowledge of ginger-based recipes acquired in northern Europe.

Wainscott began bottling Ale-8-One in 1926, and sponsored a naming contest for the drink. &quot;A Late One&quot; was chosen as the winning entry, suggesting that the product was &quot;the latest thing&quot; in soft drinks, and shortened to &quot;Ale-8-One&quot;.

In 1935, Wainscott purchased a livery stable in Winchester and converted it to a bottling factory to expand his operation. Upon Wainscott&#x27;s death in 1944, half of his company stock went to his wife; the other half was divided among his employees. When his wife died in 1954, her stock was left to her brother, Frank A. Rogers. Rogers bought the remaining company stock in 1962 and incorporated the Ale-8-One Bottling Company. He named his son, Frank Rogers Jr., manager of the new company.

The Ale-8-One Bottling Company constructed a new plant in Winchester in 1965. It ceased production of Roxa-Kola in 1968 and by 1974, had halted production of all its other drinks to focus on Ale-8-One. The company remains under the control of the Rogers family.

A limited edition reissue of Roxa-Kola was released in November 2023, and re-released for a long term run in 2024.

==Composition==
The Ale-8-One recipe is a closely guarded family secret. Reportedly, only former company president Frank A. Rogers III and his son, current president Fielding Rogers, know its exact composition. Scientific studies have proven that Ale-8-One has less caffeine than Coca-Cola, Pepsi, or Mountain Dew.

==Variants==
In 2003, the company announced limited distribution of Diet Ale-8, its first new product since the introduction of the original Ale-8 in 1926. Diet Ale 8, which was renamed Ale-8 Zero Sugar in 2020, contains 44 mg of caffeine and no sugars. The diet variety is sweetened with a mixture of acesulfame potassium and sucralose. Caffeine Free Diet Ale 8 (now Caffeine Free Ale-8 Zero Sugar), sweetened with Splenda, followed in March 2011.

In 2018, Cherry Ale-8 was released. It was first available exclusively in fountain drink form, then it became available in bottles. A zero-sugar version of Cherry Ale-8 became available in 2020. In April 2019, Ale-8-One announced a new orange cream soda flavor to be available in early May of that year. In May 2022, Blackberry Ale-8 was released to the public, in a bottled form. In May 2023, Peach Ale-8 was released as a limited edition. In July 2024, StrawMelon Ale-8 was released as a limited edition. 

==Availability and distribution==

For much of its history, Ale-8 was only available in central and eastern Kentucky. In April 2001, the Ale-8-One Bottling Company expanded its distribution to areas of southern Ohio and southern Indiana through an agreement with Coca-Cola Enterprises. Later, distribution expanded to eastern Tennessee and western Virginia. It is also available in some parts of West Virginia.

In July 2015, Ale-8 announced plans to expand distribution into Indianapolis.

===Nationwide distribution===
In 2016, Cracker Barrel began distributing the drink nationwide in all of its locations. In 2017, The Fresh Market began distributing Ale-8 and Diet Ale-8 in their stores in the eastern and Midwestern United States.

==Other products==
In 2006, the Ale-8-One Bottling Company introduced Ale-8-One Salsa, which was available as an experimental product, but became a permanent item at Kroger stores and on the company&#x27;s online store. The salsa was inspired by a Sullivan University student who won a contest commemorating the company&#x27;s 80th anniversary by making a salsa dish with Ale-8-One as an ingredient. Shortly after, Ale-8-One Barbecue Sauce was introduced.

<text>Anthony Carroll Knowles (born January 1, 1943) is an American politician and businessman who served as the seventh governor of Alaska from 1994 to 2002. Barred from seeking a third consecutive term as governor in 2002, he ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2004 and again for governor in 2006. In September 2008, Knowles became president of the National Energy Policy Institute, a non-profit energy policy organization funded by billionaire George Kaiser&#x27;s family foundation, and located at the University of Tulsa. As of , Knowles is the most recent Governor of Alaska from the Democratic Party.

Knowles was discussed as a potential Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Energy in an Obama cabinet, but in December 2008, Knowles was passed over in favor of Steven Chu as Energy secretary. He was also passed over in favor of Ken Salazar as Interior secretary. On April 28, 2010, Knowles was appointed to the National Park System Advisory Board by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. 

==Earlier life==
Knowles was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He volunteered for the United States Army in 1962, joining the 82nd Airborne Division, and later served in Vung Tau, Vietnam. Knowles achieved passage of legislation to create guaranteed veterans housing in the state&#x27;s Pioneer&#x27;s Homes, and honored their service through official days of recognition and the naming of Mount POW/MIA.

He earned a degree in economics from Yale University in 1968 where he was a Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter) brother of George W. Bush. After graduation, he moved to Alaska and worked on oil drilling rigs on the North Slope and in Cook Inlet. In 1969, Knowles started his first of four restaurants including the Downtown Deli &amp; Café in Anchorage.

An avid fly fisherman, cross-country skier, and (retired) marathon runner, Tony Knowles and his wife, former First Lady of Alaska Susan Knowles, currently reside in Anchorage, Alaska. They have three children, Devon, Luke, and Sara. His older brother, Porter Knowles, resides in Kansas.

==Political career==
After three terms in the Anchorage Assembly, he served two terms as mayor of Anchorage from 1982 to 1987. Knowles first ran for governor in 1990. He won the Democratic nomination, but was defeated by the AKIP nominee, former Governor Walter Hickel. In 1994, he defeated former lieutenant governor Stephen McAlpine in the Democratic primary and was elected governor in the general election. Knowles&#x27;s election was surprisingly close, but he also benefitted from the split conservative vote due to a strong third-party gubernatorial bid by the sitting lieutenant governor. In the election, Knowles received 41.1%, Republican candidate Jim Campbell 40.8% and lieutenant governor Jack Coghill of the Alaskan Independence Party 13%.

Knowles won the 1998 election in a landslide, defeating Republican John Lindauer 51%-18%. Knowles&#x27;s margin of victory in this race was due largely to a collapsed campaign from Republican John Lindauer, controversy surrounding Lindauer and his misrepresentation of facts on campaign finance documents, and questions about Lindauer&#x27;s state residency. Republican Robin L. Taylor, who was defeated in the primary by Lindauer, garnered 20% of the vote after announcing his write-in campaign only one week prior to the election. Knowles did not run for reelection in 2002 due to a consecutive two-term limit. Alaska law allows for more terms, but requires a break between two consecutive terms and a third.

During the September 11 attacks, Korean Air Flight 85 from Seoul was feared to have been hijacked. Worried that a possible hijacked plane might strike a target in Alaska, Governor Tony Knowles ordered the evacuation of large hotels and government buildings in Anchorage.

Knowles was chair of the Western Governors&#x27; Association in 1997, two-term chair of the Interstate Oil &amp; Gas Compact Commission, and a member of the Pew Oceans Commission (POC).

During his term, Knowles established Denali Kid Care, which provides basic health care for 25,000 children and 5,000 pregnant women. The National Child Welfare League named Knowles as their Child Advocate of the Year in 1998.

A strong supporter of the Alaska National Guard, Knowles was recipient of the Guard&#x27;s Pro Patria award and the 2001 Charles Dick Silver Medal of Merit.

Governor Knowles forged the &quot;Millennium Agreement&quot;, a government-to-government agreement with tribes to foster rural delivery of services and economic development. He earned special recognition by the National Congress of American Indians in 2001 and, with Marshall Lind, the 2002 Alaska Federation of Natives Denali Award, the highest award given to a non-native.

Knowles pushed Canadian officials to adopt his &quot;safe passage&quot; principle to protect Pacific salmon and their freshwater habitat, leading to the successful negotiation of the first coast wide salmon treaty in decades.

During his final term as governor, Republicans in the Alaska Legislature attacked him as a weak leader who avoided taking a position on several issues, as exemplified by their &quot;Where&#x27;s Tony?&quot; campaign.

In 2004, he ran for the United States Senate, as the Democratic challenger to Republican incumbent Lisa Murkowski, who had been appointed to her seat by her father, former Senator then Governor Frank Murkowski. Knowles was at first thought likely to win by many, but he was narrowly defeated in the election.

Knowles is an outspoken opponent of capital punishment.
Knowles is pro-choice, and opposes restrictions on abortion at any stage of pregnancy. He vetoed several bills passed by the state legislature regarding abortion including a ban on intact dilation and extraction abortions.

On May 29, 2006, he announced his bid to return to the governor&#x27;s office in 2006. On August 22, 2006, Knowles defeated Eric Croft in the Democratic primary to become the Democratic nominee for Governor of Alaska in the general election.

On November 7, 2006, Knowles lost the Governorship in the general election to Republican Sarah Palin. Although many had predicted a close race, including pollsters for both parties, Knowles lost by 7 points, polling lower than in his 2004 bid for the U.S. Senate. Palin received 48%.

==Obama administration==

In September 2008, Knowles became president of the National Energy Policy Institute, a non-profit energy policy organization funded by billionaire George Kaiser&#x27;s family foundation, and located at the University of Tulsa.

Due to his early support for Barack Obama, his status as a former governor of a western state, and his long-term involvement in oil and energy concerns, Knowles was discussed as a potential Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Energy in an Obama cabinet. In December 2008 Knowles was passed over in favor of Steven Chu as Energy secretary, and passed over in favor of Ken Salazar as Interior secretary.

===National Park System Advisory Board===
On April 28, 2010, Knowles was appointed to the National Park System Advisory Board by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar.

After a change in administration in 2017, he opposed many of new Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke&#x27;s policies, later claiming in his resignation letter that Zinke had no interest in the &quot;mitigation of climate change; engaging young generations; evolving a more diverse culture of park visitors, advocates and employees; bringing our schools to our parks and our parks to our schools; stressing park urbanization; (and) protecting the natural diversity of wildlife.&quot; Knowles led a mass resignation in January 2018, citing differences with the Interior Department, especially Zinke.

<doc id="438647" wikidata="Q3551667" url="?curid=438647" title="Université de Saint-Boniface">
<text>The Université de Saint-Boniface (USB) is a French-language public university located in the Saint Boniface neighbourhood of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. An affiliated institution of the University of Manitoba, the university offers general and specialized university degree programs as well as technical and professional training. In 2014, 1,368 regular students were enrolled. Its Continuing Education Division, which includes a language school, has also counted over 4,200 enrolments.

== History ==



Université de Saint-Boniface was established by Father Norbert Provencher (1787–1853) in 1818, making it western Canada&#x27;s oldest post-secondary educational institution. It began as a small school where Latin was taught to the boys of the French-speaking Red River Colony.

In 1855, Collège de Saint-Boniface was constructed on the corner of Taché Avenue and Masson Street; this was overseen by Msgr. Alexandre-Antonin Taché (1823–1894). From 1866 to 1870, under the guidance of Bishop George Dugas, Collège changed its programs to incorporate the instruction of Latin, Greek, and philosophy into a classical curriculum.

Incorporated in 1871, Collège was one of the earliest official institutions of the new province of Manitoba, which had joined the Canadian Confederation the year before. In 1877, together with the Anglican St. John&#x27;s College and the Presbyterian Manitoba College, it helped establish the University of Manitoba. Collège served both francophone and anglophone Catholic students. Around the same time, Manitoba saw an influx of French-speaking newcomers from Quebec, France, Switzerland and Belgium. In 1880, increased enrolment led to the construction of a larger building on the site of what is now Provencher Park. Annual enrolment was around 300 students at that time.

In 1890, French lost official language status in Manitoba, and in 1916, the &quot;Thornton Act&quot; prohibited French-language instruction in the province&#x27;s public schools. As a private institution, Collège remained in operation and encouraged public schools to oppose the government ban. French-language teaching continued in secret.

On November 25, 1922, a fire started in a music room in the basement and the blaze destroyed the building, including all of its records and the 40,000-volume library; claiming ten victims. In response to this, Msgr. Arthur Béliveau, Archbishop of St. Boniface, donated the seminary (&quot;Le Petit Séminaire&quot;) on Avenue de la Cathédrale, the present location of USB. English-speaking Jesuits also founded their own college (St. Paul&#x27;s College) in 1925, and USB became a francophone institution. However, Collège offered business courses in English until 1941.

The 1960s were marked by three major changes: the arrival of women in the classroom (1959), the beginnings of continuing education (including French and French as a second language classes, which sparked controversy), and the institution&#x27;s transition to secular administration (1969).

In 1975, Collège began to offer technical and professional programs, which led to the creation of the École technique et professionnelle (ETP) in 1989. In 1983, high school classes were transferred to Collège Louis-Riel and Collège began to focus solely on post-secondary education.

The institution officially became the Université de Saint-Boniface in September 2011 after the passage of the Université de Saint-Boniface Act.

Despite its new status as a university, USB continues to be affiliated with the University of Manitoba, which it helped establish in 1877. Enshrined in the &quot;Université de Saint-Boniface Act&quot;, the university remained affiliated with the University of Manitoba, and USB was committed to preserving this 135-year-old relationship. University degrees continue to be conferred by the University of Manitoba. However, graduates of the technical and professional programs of the ETP or École des sciences infirmières et des études de la santé (ESIES) receive their diploma or certificate from Université de Saint-Boniface.

Although a hub of French-language education and of Manitoba&#x27;s francophone community, USB still accepts students from around the world.

== Campus ==
 It is located on 200 Avenue de la Cathedrale, which is central to the St. Boniface neighbourhood. It is also close to the St. Boniface Hospital, the St. Boniface Cathedral, and the Red River. The Esplanade Riel leads from the Université to Winnipeg&#x27;s downtown.

The main USB building, built with Tyndall stone, houses two gymnasiums, the Sportex fitness centre, a library, a chapel, the Étienne Gaboury student centre, the campus radio station, an amphitheatre, computer facilities, a performance hall and an art gallery.

The new Pavillon Marcel-A.-Desautels health sciences building opened in 2011.

=== Student residence ===
The student residence, located at 474 and 480 Aulneau Street in Winnipeg, was acquired in 2005 from the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. In 2014, the building was officially named Résidence-Père-Théophile-Lavoie-O.M.I.

=== Fitness centre ===
Sportex, the university&#x27;s fitness centre, first opened in 1988, offering sport programmes for students, university staff, and the general public.

== Programs ==

Université de Saint-Boniface offers both university and technical and professional programs as well as continuing education courses.

=== University and college programs ===

=== Continuing education ===
Université de Saint-Boniface&#x27;s Continuing Education Division has courses in several areas. Its Language School (École de langues) has French and Spanish courses, and produces instructional material for teaching French as a first or additional language. The Continuing Education Division has an annual enrolment of over 4,000 students.

== Research ==
The research conducted at Université de Saint-Boniface is internationally recognised and focuses on areas related to the university, such as health and Francophone and Métis identity.

Founded in 1985, USB&#x27;s Research Centre houses the Centre d’études Franco-canadiennes de l’Ouest (CEFCO), Presses universitaires de Saint-Boniface (PUSB), and the Canadian Research Chair on Migrations, Transfers and Francophone Communities (CRC-MTCF). In the past it has also held the Canada Research Chair on Métis Identity (CRCMI) chaired by Dr. Denis Gagnon from 2004 to 2014, and the Community-University Research Alliance on Francophone Identities in Western Canada (ARUC-IFO) chaired by Dr. Len Rivard from 2007 to 2013.

==Scholarships and bursaries==
The Canadian government sponsors an Aboriginal Bursaries Search Tool that lists more than 680 scholarships, bursaries, and other incentives offered by governments, universities, and industry to support Aboriginal post-secondary participation. Université de Saint-Boniface scholarships for Aboriginal, First Nations and Métis students include: Louis Riel Scholarships; Louis Riel Institute Bursaries.

== Administration ==
The purposes and powers of Université de Saint-Boniface are set out in the &quot;Université de Saint-Boniface Act&quot;, the most recent version of which is dated June 2011. Its bilateral governance structure consists of the Board of Governors and the Senate. A number of ad hoc committees are also in place.

=== USB President ===

Originally from Lévis, a suburb of Québec city, Sophie Bouffard obtained a doctorate in musicology (2011) from the University of Regina and a masters in music (2000) from Université Laval. Soprano opera singer by profession, she has given a number of performances in Canada and abroad. Specialist in the creation of new music, many works have been composed for her. Mrs. Bouffard is the second female president in USB history and is the 45th person to hold the position. She has been the USB president since August 2019.

<doc id="438651" wikidata="Q349166" url="?curid=438651" title="Ben Johnson (actor)">
<text>Francis Benjamin Johnson Jr. (June 13, 1918 – April 8, 1996) was an American film and television actor, stuntman, and world-champion rodeo cowboy. Johnson brought authenticity to many roles in Westerns with his droll manner and expert horsemanship.

The son of a rancher, Johnson arrived in Hollywood to deliver a consignment of horses for a film. He did stunt-double work for several years before breaking into acting with the help of John Ford. An elegiac portrayal of a former cowboy theater owner in the 1950s coming-of-age drama &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; won Johnson the 1971 Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Johnson also operated a horse-breeding ranch throughout his career. Although he said he had succeeded by sticking to what he knew, shrewd real estate investments made Johnson worth an estimated $100 million by his later years.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in Foraker, Oklahoma, on the Osage Indian Reservation, of self-identified Irish and Cherokee ancestry, the son of Ollie Susan Johnson (née Workmon) and Ben Johnson Sr. His father was a rancher and rodeo champion in Osage County.

==Film career==
Johnson&#x27;s film career began with the Howard Hughes film &quot;The Outlaw&quot;.

Johnson liked to say later that he got to Hollywood in a carload of horses.

His work as a stuntman caught the eye of director John Ford, who hired Johnson for stunt work in the 1948 film &quot;Fort Apache&quot;, and as the riding double for Henry Fonda. During shooting, the horses pulling a wagon with three men in it stampeded. Johnson, who &quot;happened to be settin&#x27; on a horse&quot;, stopped the runaway wagon and saved the men. When Ford promised that he would be rewarded, Johnson hoped it would be with another doubling job, or maybe a small speaking role. Instead, he received a seven-year acting contract from Ford. Ford called Johnson into his office, and handed him an envelope with a contract in it. Johnson started reading it, and when he got to the fifth line and it said &quot;$5,000 a week,&quot; he stopped reading, grabbed a pen, signed it, and gave it back to Ford.

His first credited role was in Ford&#x27;s &quot;3 Godfathers&quot;; the film is notable for the riding skills demonstrated by both Johnson and star Pedro Armendáriz. He later said the film was the most physically challenging of his career. Ford then suggested a starring role for him in the 1949 film &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;; he played Gregg opposite Terry Moore. Ford cast him in the remaining two of the three films that have come to be known as Ford&#x27;s cavalry trilogy, all starring John Wayne: &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; (1949), and &quot;Rio Grande&quot; (1950) joining &quot;Fort Apache&quot;. Both roles showcased Johnson&#x27;s riding ability. Ford also cast Johnson as the lead in &quot;Wagon Master&quot; (1950), one of Ford&#x27;s favorites.

In real life Johnson&#x27;s demeanor was calm but firm; even in tense situations he did not show any bad temper. And though known for avoiding drama, he had definite boundaries, both in life and as an actor. During the making of &quot;Rio Grande&quot; he defied Ford, who was notorious for browbeating his actors, and reportedly told him to go to hell. Johnson thought the incident had been forgotten, but Ford did not use him in a film for over a decade. Johnson also appeared in four films of tempestuous director Sam Peckinpah and had a good relationship with him, with Peckinpah appreciating Johnson&#x27;s authenticity and lack of acting airs.

Johnson played in supporting roles in &quot;Shane&quot; (1953), where he appeared as Chris Calloway, a &quot;bad guy who makes good&quot; after being beaten senseless by Alan Ladd, and &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; (1961) starring Marlon Brando. In 1964, he worked with Ford again in &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot;. The Peckinpah-directed films included &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965, with Charlton Heston), &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969, with William Holden and Robert Ryan), and two back-to-back starring Steve McQueen, &quot;The Getaway&quot; and &quot;Junior Bonner&quot;, a rodeo film, (both 1972). In 1973, he co-starred as Melvin Purvis in John Milius&#x27; &quot;Dillinger&quot; with Warren Oates; he also appeared in Milius&#x27; 1984 film &quot;Red Dawn&quot;. In 1975, he played the character Mister in &quot;Bite the Bullet&quot;, starring Gene Hackman and James Coburn. He also appeared with Charles Bronson in 1975&#x27;s &quot;Breakheart Pass&quot;. In 1980, he was cast as Sheriff Isum Gorch in &quot;Soggy Bottom U.S.A.&quot;

Johnson played Bartlett in the 1962–63 season of &quot;Have Gun Will Travel&quot;, which featured a short scene of his riding skills. In 1963, Johnson appeared as Spinner on the TV Western &quot;The Virginian&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Duel at Shiloh&quot;. In the 1966–67 television season, Johnson appeared as the character Sleeve in all 26 episodes of the ABC family Western &quot;The Monroes&quot; with co-stars Michael Anderson Jr. and Barbara Hershey.

He teamed up with John Wayne again, and director Andrew V. McLaglen, in two films, appearing with Rock Hudson in &quot;The Undefeated&quot; (1969) and in a fairly prominent role in &quot;Chisum&quot; (1970). The apex of Johnson&#x27;s career was reached in 1971 with his performance as Sam the Lion in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; earning him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

On the set of &quot;The Train Robbers&quot;, in June 1972, he told Nancy Anderson of Copley News Service that winning the Oscar for &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; was not going to change him and he would not raise his salary request to studios because of it. He continued, &quot;I grew up on a ranch and I know livestock, so I like working in Westerns. All my life I&#x27;ve been afraid of failure. To avoid it, I&#x27;ve stuck with doing things I know how to do, and it&#x27;s made me a good living&quot;.

He played Cap Roundtree in the 1979 miniseries &quot;The Sacketts&quot;. He played Sam Bellows in the 1980 film &quot;Ruckus&quot; and Jack Mason in the 1984 action adventure &quot;Red Dawn&quot;. He co-starred in the 1994 version of &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot;.

He continued ranching during the entire time, operating a horse-breeding ranch in Sylmar, California. In addition, he sponsored the Ben Johnson Pro Celebrity Team Roping and Penning competition in Oklahoma City, the proceeds from which benefitted Children&#x27;s Medical Research Inc. and the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Oklahoma.

== Rodeo championship ==
Johnson was drawn to the rodeos and horse breeding of his early years. In 1953, he took a break from well-paid film work to compete in the Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA), becoming the Team Roping World Champion; although he only broke even financially that year. Johnson was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1979. According to his ProRodeo Hall of Fame entry, he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve won a rodeo world championship, and I&#x27;m prouder of that than anything else I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
Johnson&#x27;s 1941 marriage to Carol Elaine Jones lasted until her death on March 27, 1994. They had no children. She was the daughter of noted Hollywood horse wrangler Clarence &quot;Fat&quot; Jones. Johnson continued to work almost steadily until his death.

On April 8, 1996, aged 77, Johnson collapsed and died from a heart attack while visiting his then 96-year-old mother Ollie at Leisure World in Mesa, Arizona, the suburban Phoenix retirement community where they both lived. Johnson&#x27;s body was later transported from Arizona to Pawhuska, Oklahoma, for burial at the Pawhuska City Cemetery.

Ollie died on October 16, 2000, aged 101.

In 2003 Johnson was inducted into the Texas Trail of Fame.

==Legacy==

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Johnson has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7083 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1982, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. In 1996, Tom Thurman made a documentary film about Johnson&#x27;s life, titled &quot;Ben Johnson: Third Cowboy on the Right&quot;, written by Thurman and Tom Marksbury.

The Ben Johnson Cowboy Museum was opened in honor of Ben Johnson in his hometown of Pawhuska in June 2019. The museum showcases the life and career of Ben Johnson, as well as his father, Ben Johnson Sr., who was also a world-champion cowboy. In addition to the Ben Johnsons, the museum also features other world-champion cowboys and cowgirls, famous ranches (like the one Ben grew up on), and cowboy artists and craftsmen, all from the area where Ben grew up.

The Ben Johnson Memorial Steer Roping and the International Roundup Cavalcade, the world&#x27;s largest amateur rodeo, are held annually in Pawhuska, Oklahoma.

A one-and-a-quarter-sized bronze sculpture by John D. Free of Ben Johnson riding a horse and roping a steer was commissioned and produced in Pawhuska, Oklahoma.

<text>Billy Budd, Sailor (An Inside Narrative), also known as Billy Budd, Foretopman, is a novella by American writer Herman Melville, left unfinished at his death in 1891. Acclaimed by critics as a masterpiece when a hastily transcribed version was finally published in 1924, it quickly took its place as a classic second only to &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; among Melville&#x27;s works. Billy Budd is a &quot;handsome sailor&quot; who strikes and inadvertently kills his false accuser, Master-at-arms John Claggart. The ship&#x27;s Captain, Edward Vere, recognizes Billy&#x27;s lack of intent, but claims that the law of mutiny requires him to sentence Billy to be hanged. 

Melville began work on the novella in November 1886, revising and expanding it from time to time, but he left the manuscript in disarray. Melville&#x27;s widow Elizabeth began to edit the manuscript for publication, but was not able to discern her husband&#x27;s intentions at key points, even as to the book&#x27;s title. Raymond M. Weaver, Melville&#x27;s first biographer, was given the manuscript and published the 1924 version, which was marred by misinterpretation of Elizabeth&#x27;s queries, misreadings of Melville&#x27;s difficult handwriting, and even inclusion of a preface Melville had cut. Melville scholars Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts Jr. published what is considered the best transcription and critical reading text in 1962. In 2017, Northwestern University Press published a &quot;new reading text&quot; based on a &quot;corrected version&quot; of Hayford and Sealts&#x27; genetic text prepared by G. Thomas Tanselle.

&quot;Billy Budd&quot; has been adapted into film, a stage play, and an opera.

==Plot==
Billy Budd is an English seaman impressed into service aboard the Royal Navy warship HMS &quot;Bellipotent&quot; in 1797, when the Navy was reeling from the Spithead and Nore mutinies and threatened by the First French Republic&#x27;s military ambitions. He is impressed onto &quot;Bellipotent&quot; from the British merchant ship &quot;The Rights of Man&quot; (named after the book by Thomas Paine).

Billy, a foundling from Bristol, has an innocence, good looks and a natural charisma that make him popular with the crew. He has a stutter, which becomes more noticeable when under intense emotion. He arouses the antagonism of the ship&#x27;s master-at-arms, John Claggart. Claggart, while not unattractive, seems somehow &quot;defective or abnormal in the constitution&quot;, possessing a &quot;natural depravity.&quot; Envy is Claggart&#x27;s explicitly stated emotion toward Budd, foremost because of his &quot;significant personal beauty,&quot; and also for his innocence and general popularity. (Melville further opines that envy is &quot;universally felt to be more shameful than even felonious crime.&quot;) This leads Claggart to falsely charge Billy with conspiracy to mutiny. When the captain, Edward Fairfax &quot;Starry&quot; Vere, is presented with Claggart&#x27;s charges, he summons Claggart and Billy to his cabin for a private meeting. Claggart makes his case and Billy, astounded, is unable to respond, due to his stutter. In his extreme frustration he strikes out at Claggart, killing him instantly.

Vere convenes a drumhead court-martial. He acts as convening authority, prosecutor, defense counsel and sole witness (except for Billy). He intervenes in the deliberations of the court-martial panel to persuade them to convict Billy, despite their and his beliefs in Billy&#x27;s moral innocence. (Vere says in the moments following Claggart&#x27;s death, &quot;Struck dead by an angel of God! Yet the angel must hang!&quot;) Vere claims to be following the letter of the Mutiny Act and the Articles of War.

Although Vere and the other officers did not believe Claggart&#x27;s charge of conspiracy and think Billy justified in his response, they find that their own opinions matter little. The martial law in effect states that during wartime the blow itself, fatal or not, is a capital crime. The court-martial convicts Billy following Vere&#x27;s argument that any appearance of weakness in the officers and failure to enforce discipline could stir more mutiny throughout the Royal Navy. Condemned to be hanged the morning after his attack on Claggart, Billy&#x27;s last words prior to his execution are &quot;God bless Captain Vere!&quot;, which are repeated by the gathered crew in a &quot;resonant and sympathetic echo.&quot;

The novel closes with three short chapters that present ambiguity:
* describes the death of Captain Vere. In a naval action against the French ship &quot;Athée&quot; (the &quot;Atheist&quot;), Captain Vere is mortally wounded. His last words are &quot;Billy Budd, Billy Budd.&quot;
* presents an extract from an official naval gazette purporting to give the facts of the fates of John Claggart and Billy Budd aboard HMS &quot;Bellipotent&quot;, but the &quot;facts&quot; offered turn the facts that the reader learned from the story upside down. The gazette article describes Budd as a conspiring mutineer likely of foreign birth and mysterious antecedents who is confronted by John Claggart. The master-at-arms, loyally enforcing the law, is fatally stabbed by Budd. The gazette concludes that the crime and weapon used suggest a foreign birth and subversive character; it reports that the mutineer was executed and nothing is amiss aboard HMS &quot;Bellipotent&quot;.
* is a cheaply printed ballad, &quot;Billy in the Darbies&quot;, written by one of Billy&#x27;s shipmates as an elegy. The adult, experienced man represented in the poem is not the innocent youth portrayed in the preceding chapters.

==Composition history==
Composed fitfully over the last five years of his life, the novella &quot;Billy Budd&quot; represents Melville&#x27;s return to prose fiction after three decades of only writing poetry. Melville had a difficult time writing, describing his process with &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; as follows: &quot;And taking a book off the brain is akin to the ticklish and dangerous business of taking an old painting off a panel—you have to scrape off the whole brain in order to get at it with due safety—and even then the painting may not be worth the trouble...&quot;
The &quot;scrapings&quot; of &quot;Billy Budd&quot; lie in the 351 leaves of manuscript now in the Houghton Library at Harvard University.

The state of this manuscript has been described as &quot;chaotic,&quot; with a bewildering array of corrections, cancellations, cut and pasted leaves, annotations by several hands, and with at least two different attempts made at a . The composition proceeded in three general phases, as shown by the Melville scholars Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., who did an extensive study of the original papers from 1953 to 1962. They concluded from the evidence of the paper used at each stage, the writing instruments (pencil, pen, color of ink), insertions, and crossings out that Melville introduced the three main characters in three stages of composition: first Billy, in a draft of what became &quot;Billy in the Darbies&quot;; then Claggart: and finally Vere. 

The work started as a poem, a ballad entitled &quot;Billy in the Darbies&quot;, which Melville intended for his book, &quot;John Marr and Other Sailors&quot;. He added a short, prose head-note to introduce the speaker and set the scene. The character of &quot;Billy&quot; in this early version was an older man condemned for inciting mutiny and apparently guilty as charged. He did not include the poem in his published book. Melville incorporated the ballad and expanded the head-note sketch into a story that eventually reached 150 manuscript pages. This was the first of the three major expansions, each related to one of the principal characters. As the focus of his attention shifted from one to another of these three principals, he modified the plot and thematic emphasis. Because Melville never entirely finished the revisions, critics have been divided as to where the emphasis lay and to Melville&#x27;s intentions.

After Melville&#x27;s death, his wife Elizabeth, who had acted as his amanuensis on other projects, scribbled notes and conjectures, corrected spelling, sorted leaves and, in some instances, wrote over her husband&#x27;s faint writing. She tried to follow through on what she perceived as her husband&#x27;s objectives but her editing was confusing to the first professional editors, Weaver and Freeman, who mistook her writing for Melville&#x27;s. For instance, she put several pages into a folder and marked it &quot;Preface?&quot; indicating that she did not know what her husband had intended. At some point Elizabeth Melville placed the manuscript in &quot;a japanned tin box&quot; with the author&#x27;s other literary materials, where it remained undiscovered for another 28 years.

==Publication history==
In August 1918, Raymond M. Weaver, a professor at Columbia University, doing research for what would become the first biography of Melville, paid a visit to Melville&#x27;s granddaughter, Eleanor Melville Metcalf, at her South Orange, New Jersey home. She gave him access to all the records of Melville that survived in the family: manuscripts, letters, journals, annotated books, photographs, and a variety of other material. Among these papers, Weaver was astonished to find a substantial manuscript for an unknown prose work entitled &quot;Billy Budd&quot;.

After producing a text that would later be described as &quot;hastily transcribed&quot;, he published the first edition of the work in 1924 as &quot;Billy Budd, Foretopman&quot; in Volume XIII of the Standard Edition of Melville&#x27;s &quot;Complete Works&quot; (London: Constable and Company). In 1928 he published another version of the text that, despite numerous variations, may be considered essentially the same text.

F. Barron Freeman published a second text in 1948, edited on different principles, as &quot;Melville&#x27;s Billy Budd&quot; (Cambridge: Harvard University Press). He believed he stayed closer to what Melville wrote, but still relied on Weaver&#x27;s text, with what are now considered mistaken assumptions and textual errors. Subsequent editions of &quot;Billy Budd&quot; up through the early 1960s are, strictly speaking, versions of one or the other of these two basic texts.

After several years of study, in 1962, Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., established what is now considered the correct, authoritative text. It was published by the University of Chicago Press, and contains both a &quot;reading&quot; and a &quot;genetic&quot; text. Most editions printed since then follow the Hayford-Sealts text.

Based on the confusing manuscripts, the published versions had many variations. For example, early versions gave the book&#x27;s title as &quot;Billy Budd, Foretopman&quot;, while it now seems clear Melville intended &quot;Billy Budd, Sailor (An Inside Narrative)&quot;; some versions wrongly included as a preface a chapter that Melville had excised (the correct text has no preface). In addition, some early versions did not follow his change of the name of the ship to &quot;Bellipotent&quot; (from the Latin &quot;bellum&quot; war and &quot;potens&quot; powerful), from &quot;Indomitable&quot;, as Melville called it in an earlier draft. His full intentions in changing the name of the ship are unclear, since he used the name &quot;Bellipotent&quot; only six times.

==Literary significance and reception==
The book has undergone a number of substantial critical reevaluations in the years since its discovery. Raymond Weaver, its first editor, was initially unimpressed and described it as &quot;not distinguished&quot;. After its publication debut in England, and with critics of such caliber as D. H. Lawrence and John Middleton Murry hailing it as a masterpiece, Weaver changed his mind. In the introduction to its second edition in the 1928 &quot;Shorter Novels of Herman Melville&quot;, he declared: &quot;In &quot;Pierre&quot;, Melville had hurled himself into a fury of vituperation against the world; with &quot;Billy Budd&quot; he would justify the ways of God to man.&quot; German novelist Thomas Mann declared that &quot;Billy Budd&quot; was &quot;one of the most beautiful stories in the world&quot; and that it &quot;made his heart wide open&quot;; he declared that he wished he had written the scene of Billy&#x27;s dying.

In mid-1924 Murry orchestrated the reception of &quot;Billy Budd, Foretopman,&quot; first in London, in the influential &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, in an essay called &quot;Herman Melville&#x27;s Silence&quot; (July 10, 1924), then in a reprinting of the essay, slightly expanded, in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; (August 10, 1924). In relatively short order he and several other influential British literati had managed to canonize &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, placing it alongside &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; as one of the great books of Western literature. Wholly unknown to the public until 1924, &quot;Billy Budd&quot; by 1926 had joint billing with the book that had just recently been firmly established as a literary masterpiece. In its first text and subsequent texts, and as read by different audiences, the book has kept that high status ever since.

In 1990 the Melville biographer and scholar Hershel Parker pointed out that all the early estimations of &quot;Billy Budd&quot; were based on readings from the flawed transcription texts of Weaver. Some of these flaws were crucial to an understanding of Melville&#x27;s intent, such as the famous &quot;coda&quot; at the end of the chapter containing the news account of the death of the &quot;admirable&quot; John Claggart and the &quot;depraved&quot; William Budd (25 in Weaver, 29 in Hayford &amp; Sealts reading text, 344Ba in the genetic text) :

&quot;Weaver&quot;: &quot;Here ends a story not unwarranted by what happens in this incongruous world of ours—innocence and &#x27;infirmary&#x27;, spiritual depravity and fair &#x27;respite&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;The Ms&quot;: &quot;Here ends a story not unwarranted by what happens in this {&quot;word undeciphered&quot;} world of ours—innocence and &#x27;infamy&#x27;, spiritual depravity and fair &#x27;repute&#x27;.&quot;

Melville had written this as an end-note after his second major revision. When he enlarged the book with the third major section, developing Captain Vere, he deleted the end-note, as it no longer applied to the expanded story. Many of the early readers, such as Murry and Freeman, thought this passage was a foundational statement of Melville&#x27;s philosophical views on life. Parker wonders what they could possibly have understood from the passage as printed.

==Analysis and interpretations==
Hershel Parker agrees that &quot;masterpiece&quot; is an appropriate description of the book, but he adds a proviso. [E]xamining the history and reputation of &quot;Billy Budd&quot; has left me more convinced than before that it deserves high stature (although not precisely the high stature it holds, whatever that stature is) and more convinced that it is a wonderfully teachable story—as long as it is not taught as a finished, complete, coherent, and totally interpretable work of art. Given this unfinished quality and Melville&#x27;s reluctance to present clear lessons, the range of critical response is not surprising. A wide range of views by about twenty-five different authors, including Raymond Weaver, Lewis Mumford, Newton Arvin, and W.H. Auden, are published in &quot;Melville&#x27;s Billy Budd and the Critics&quot;.

Some critics have interpreted &quot;Billy Budd&quot; as a historical novel that attempts to evaluate man&#x27;s relation to the past. Thomas J. Scorza has written about the philosophical framework of the story. He understands the work as a comment on the historical feud between poets and philosophers. By this interpretation, Melville is opposing the scientific, rational systems of thought, which Claggart&#x27;s character represents, in favor of the more comprehensive poetic pursuit of knowledge embodied by Billy.

The centrality of Billy Budd&#x27;s extraordinary good looks in the novella, where he is described by Captain Vere as &quot;the young fellow who seems so popular with the men—Billy, the Handsome Sailor,&quot; have led to interpretations of a homoerotic sensibility in the novel. Laura Mulvey added a theory of scopophilia and masculine and feminine subjectivity/objectivity. This version tends to inform interpretations of Britten&#x27;s opera, perhaps owing to the composer&#x27;s own homosexuality. In her book &quot;Epistemology of the Closet&quot; (1990/2008), Eve Sedgwick, expanding on earlier interpretations of the same themes, posits that the interrelationships between Billy, Claggart and Captain Vere are representations of male homosexual desire and the mechanisms of prohibition against this desire. She points out that Claggart&#x27;s &quot;natural depravity,&quot; which is defined tautologically as &quot;depravity according to nature,&quot; and the accumulation of equivocal terms (&quot;phenomenal&quot;, &quot;mystery&quot;, etc.) used in the explanation of the fault in his character, are an indication of his status as the central homosexual figure in the text. She also interprets the mutiny scare aboard the &quot;Bellipotent&quot;, the political circumstances that are at the center of the events of the story, as a portrayal of homophobia.

Melville&#x27;s dramatic presentation of the contradiction between the requirements of the law and the needs of humanity made the novella an iconic text in the field of law and literature. Earlier readers viewed Captain Vere as good man trapped by bad law. Richard Weisberg, who holds degrees in both comparative literature and law, argued that Vere was wrong to play the roles of witness, prosecutor, judge, and executioner, and that he went beyond the law when he sentenced Billy to immediate hanging. Based on his study of statutory law and practices in the Royal Navy in the era in which the book takes place, Weisberg argues that Vere deliberately distorted the applicable substantive and procedural law to bring about Billy&#x27;s death. Judge Richard Posner has sharply criticized these claims. He objects to ascribing literary significance to legal errors that are not part of the imagined world of Melville&#x27;s fiction and accused Weisberg and others of calling Billy an &quot;innocent man&quot; and making light of the fact that he &quot;struck a lethal blow to a superior officer in wartime.&quot; The first issue of &quot;Cardozo Studies in Law and Literature&quot; is devoted to &quot;Billy Budd&quot; and includes essays by Weisberg and Posner.

H. Bruce Franklin sees a direct connection between the hanging of Budd and the controversy around capital punishment. While Melville was writing &quot;Billy Budd&quot; between 1886 and 1891, the public&#x27;s attention was focused on the issue. Other commentators have suggested that the story may have been based on events on board USS &quot;Somers&quot;, an American naval vessel; Lt. Guert Gansevoort, a defendant in a later investigation, was a first cousin of Melville. If so then the character Billy Budd was likely inspired by a young man named Philip Spencer who was hanged on USS &quot;Somers&quot; on December 1, 1842.

Harold Schechter, a professor who has written books on American serial killers, has said that the author&#x27;s description of Claggart could be considered to be a definition of a sociopath. He acknowledges that Melville was writing at a time before the word &quot;sociopath&quot; was used. Dr. Robert Hare might classify Claggart as a psychopath, since his personality did not demonstrate the traits of a sociopath (rule-breaking) but of grandiosity, cunning manipulation, and a lack of empathy or remorse.

===In law and literature===
Since the late 20th century, &quot;Billy Budd&quot; has become a central text in the field of legal scholarship known as law and literature.
The climactic trial has been the focus of scholarly inquiry regarding the motives of Vere and the legal necessity of Billy&#x27;s condemnation. Vere states, given the circumstances of Claggart&#x27;s slaying, condemning Billy to death would be unjust. While critics have viewed Vere as a character caught between the pressures between unbending legalism and malleable moral principles, other critics have differed in opinion. Such other critics have argued that Vere represents a ressentient protagonist whose disdain for Lord Admiral Nelson he takes out on Billy, in whom Vere sees the traits of Nelson&#x27;s that he resents. One scholar argues that Vere manipulated and misrepresented the applicable laws to condemn Billy, showing that the laws of the time did not require a sentence of death and that legally any such sentence required review before being carried out. While this argument has been criticized for drawing on information outside the novel, Weisberg also shows that sufficient liberties existed in the laws Melville describes to avoid a capital sentence.

Darryl Ponicsan&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;The Last Detail&quot; involves a Navy enlisted man protagonist, Billy Buddusky, a homage to Melville. Buddusky dies in a brawl with the Shore Patrol. The book was later made into a 1973 film by Hal Ashby. The film omits the original ending by Ponicsan.

==Adaptations in other media==
===Theater and opera===
* In 1951, Louis O. Coxe and Robert Chapman&#x27;s 1949 stage adaptation, &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, opened on Broadway, winning both the Donaldson Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards for best play.
* The best-known adaptation is the opera &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, with a score by Benjamin Britten and a libretto by E. M. Forster and Eric Crozier. The opera follows the earlier text of 1924, and was premiered in December 1951 in a 4-act version. Britten, Forster and Crozier subsequently revised the opera into a 2-act version, which was first performed in January 1964. Scholar Hanna Rochlitz has studied the adaptation of the novella into this opera in detail.
* Giorgio Ghedini also composed an Italian-language opera, premiered in 1949, adapted from the novella with a libretto by Salvatore Quasimodo based on the 1942 Italian translation by Eugenio Montale. The Ghedini opera has not been as widely performed as Britten&#x27;s work.

===Film===
* Peter Ustinov produced and directed the 1962 film &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, adapting its script from Coxe and Chapman&#x27;s 1951 Broadway production (above). The black-and-white film costars a young Terence Stamp as the title character, Ustinov as Captain Vere, Robert Ryan as Master d&#x27;Arms Claggart, and Melvyn Douglas as &quot;The Dansker&quot;. Actors David McCallum, Paul Rogers, and John Neville are also featured in the film as officers aboard HMS &quot;Avenger&quot;.
* Claire Denis&#x27; &quot;Beau Travail&quot; (1999), set in Djibouti, is loosely based on the novel. In the 2022 &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; decennial poll of film critics and directors to determine current thinking on which films are the best of all time, &quot;Beau Travail&quot; was one of the new entries into the top ten, placing seventh.

=== Music ===

* &quot;Billy Budd&quot; is a song on the 1994 album &quot;Vauxhall and I&quot; by English indie artist Morrissey.

===Television===
* General Motors Theatre presented a live telecast of &quot;Billy Budd&quot; in 1955, starring a young William Shatner as Billy Budd, with Douglas Campbell as Claggart and Basil Rathbone as Captain Vere. Britten&#x27;s &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot; was included as background music.
* Two different productions based on the Britten opera were broadcast in 1988 and 1998.

===Radio===
* In 2002, Focus on the Family adapted &quot;Billy Budd, Sailor&quot; as an audio drama for its Radio Theater program. Edward Woodward played Captain Vere. 

===Audiobook===
* In 2018 the actor and audiobook narrator Liam Gerrard narrated the audiobook version of &quot;Billy Budd, Sailor&quot; for Enriched Classics.

<text>St. Boniface (or Saint Boniface) is a city ward and neighbourhood in Winnipeg. Along with being the centre of the Franco-Manitoban community, it ranks as the largest francophone community in Western Canada.

It features such landmarks as the St. Boniface Cathedral, Boulevard Provencher, the Provencher Bridge, Esplanade Riel, Saint Boniface Hospital, the Université de Saint-Boniface, and the Royal Canadian Mint.

The area covers much of eastern Winnipeg, including Old St. Boniface. It consists of the neighbourhoods of Norwood West, Norwood East, Windsor Park, Niakwa Park, Niakwa Place, Southdale, Southland Park, Royalwood, Sage Creek, and Island Lakes, among others, plus a large industrial area. The ward is represented by Matt Allard, a member of Winnipeg City Council, and also corresponds to the neighbourhood clusters of St. Boniface East and West. The population was 58,520 according to the Canada 2016 Census.

==History==


Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years before European exploration. It is an area of historic Ojibwe occupation.

Fur traders and European mercenaries hired by Thomas Douglas, Lord Selkirk, to protect his fledgling Red River Colony were among the area&#x27;s first European settlers. With the founding of a Roman Catholic mission in 1818, St. Boniface began its role in Canadian religious, political and cultural history: as mother parish for many French settlements in Western Canada; as the birthplace of Louis Riel and fellow Métis who struggled to obtain favourable terms for Manitoba&#x27;s entry into Confederation; and as a focus of resistance to controversial 1890 legislation to alter Manitoba&#x27;s school system and abolish French as an official language in the province (see Manitoba Schools Question).

French-speaking religious orders, including the Sisters of Charity of Montreal (better known as the Grey Nuns), who arrived in 1844, founded the early educational, cultural and social-service institutions, such as St. Boniface Hospital, the first in Western Canada. Early French-speaking missionary Catholic priests in the region founded the Collège de Saint-Boniface (dating to 1818) to teach Latin and general humanities to the local boys; it is now the Université de Saint-Boniface.

St. Boniface was incorporated as a town in 1883 and as a city in 1908.

The early economy was oriented to agriculture. Industrialization arrived in the early 20th century. The Union Stockyards, developed 1912–13, became the largest livestock exchange in Canada and a centre of the meat-packing and -processing industry. By the early 1900s, numerous light and heavy industries were established. Redevelopment of the Stockyards site as a housing and retail area by Olexa Developments of Calgary is scheduled for 2020. It is planned that in the first phase of the development, 600 housing units are to be constructed.

In the 1950s and 1960s the neighbourhoods of Windsor Park and Southdale developed into residential areas. In 2016 Windsor Park had a population of 10,050 and Southdale had a population of 6,450.

In 1971, St. Boniface was amalgamated, along with several neighbouring communities, into the City of Winnipeg. As one of the largest French-Canadian communities outside Québec, it has often been a centre of struggles to preserve French-Canadian language and culture within Manitoba.

==Places and culture==
The St. Boniface area covers much of the eastern part of Winnipeg, including Old St. Boniface.

It also includes the Canadian National Railway&#x27;s Symington Yards, a major rail-handling facility; and the Union Stockyards, which were once the largest of their kind in Canada.

===Neighbourhoods===
The St. Boniface city ward, represented by City Councillor Matt Allard, is composed of the following neighbourhoods: Archwood, Dufresne, Central St. Boniface, Holden, Island Lakes, Maginot, The Mint, Mission Industrial, Niakwa Park, Niakwa Place, North St. Boniface, Norwood East, Norwood West, Southdale, Stock Yards, and Windsor Park.

The ward mostly corresponds to the community area of St. Boniface and neighbourhood clusters of St. Boniface East and West, which are used by Statistics Canada for demographic purposes. However, while the community area—or clusters—include all of the neighbourhoods of the city ward, it also extends eastward past Lagimodière Boulevard to Plessis Road, thereby including the neighbourhoods of Dugald, Royalwood, Sage Creek, Southland Park, St. Boniface Industrial Park, and Symington Yards.

===Culture===
St. Boniface is home to the Festival du Voyageur, held annually in February outdoors at Whittier Park and Fort Gibraltar, as well as Cinémental, the city&#x27;s annual francophone film festival.

The area also hosts the (CCFM; the Franco-Manitoban Cultural Centre), which features an art gallery, theatres, meeting rooms, and a community radio station; Le Musée de Saint-Boniface Museum, a local museum dedicated to Franco-Manitoban culture and history; and Le Cercle Molière, a French-language theatre group and Canada&#x27;s oldest theatre company.

The is a heritage centre housing the largest Franco-Manitoban archives in Manitoba, as well as the (SHSB), the oldest historical society in western Canada.

===Landmarks===
The area features such landmarks as the Boulevard Provencher, Esplanade Riel, Fort Gibraltar, Lagimodière-Gaboury Park, the Provencher Bridge, the Royal Canadian Mint, St. Boniface Cathedral (including the grave of Louis Riel in its churchyard), St. Boniface Hospital, and the Université de Saint-Boniface.

The House of Archbishop Alexandre-Antonin Taché, which is now used for administrative purposes by the Archdiocese of St. Boniface, is one of the oldest stone buildings in western Canada.

<text>Franco-Manitobans () are French Canadians or Canadian francophones living in the province of Manitoba. According to the 2016 Canadian Census, 40,975 residents of the province stated that French was their mother tongue. In the same census, 148,810 Manitobans claimed to have either full or partial French ancestry. There are several Franco-Manitoban communities throughout Manitoba, although the majority are based in either the Winnipeg Capital Region or the Eastman Region.

The first francophones to enter the region were fur traders during the late 17th century, with the first French settlers arriving in the subsequent century. Francophones constituted the majority of the region&#x27;s non-First Nations population until the mid 19th century, when anglophones became the linguistic majority. In 1869, the Red River Rebellion was sparked by a group of Métis francophones, eventually resulting in the admittance of the Red River Colony as a bilingual province of Canada. However, the provincial government moved to revoke the linguistic rights accorded to francophones late 19th and early 20th centuries. Restoration of these linguistic rights did not begin until 1970, when French was made an official language of its public education system. The linguistic rights of Franco-Manitobans was also furthered as a result of several decisions made by the Supreme Court of Canada during the 1970s to 1990s.

==Demographics==
According to the 2016 Canadian Census, the number of people that reported French as a mother tongue in Manitoba was 46,055 (or 3.7 per cent of the population), making it the most common mother tongue in the province after English, German, and Tagalog. The majority of Franco-Manitobans are bilingual in English and French, with only 1,485 respondents (0.1 per cent of Manitobans) in the 2016 census reporting they only had proficiency in the French language. There were 108,455 Manitobans or 8.6 per cent of the population that reported that they were bilingual in English and French, although that figure includes Manitobans that speak French as a second language.

Nearly three quarters of all Franco-Manitobans (74 per cent of the population) were born in the province. Approximately 15 per cent of francophones in Manitoba were born in Canada outside of Manitoba; while the remaining francophones that reside in the province were born outside the country. Among French-speaking Manitobans that were born abroad, approximately 57 per cent originated from Africa, and 28 per cent originated from Europe.

In the 2016 census, 148,810 Manitobans reported having partial or full French ancestry.

===Communities===

Francophone communities in Manitoba are concentrated in southern Manitoba, along corridors that follow the Seine and Red River of the North towards Lake Manitoba. Four out of five francophones in Manitoba reside in either the Winnipeg Capital Region or Eastman Region: 58 per cent in the Winnipeg Capital Region, 22 per cent in Eastman Region. Approximately 90 per cent of all Franco-Manitobans live within an hour&#x27;s drive from Winnipeg.

There also exist francophone communities outside those regions, including Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes, St. Claude, Sainte Rose du Lac, and St. Laurent. Including the capital, there are 15 communities in the province that are officially designated as bilingual areas.

==History==
The first French speakers to visit Manitoba occurred in the 1660s, with French fur traders and explorers exploring the region around Hudson&#x27;s Bay. However, the first attempts by francophones to settle the area did not occur until the 1730s, with French explorer Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye and his sons establishing a permanent presence in southern Manitoba. A number of francophone fur traders married &quot;à la façon du pays&quot;, wedding First Nations wives whose children eventually developed a unique Métis identity. Until the mid-19th century, fur traders continued to encompass the majority of Europeans in the region, with francophone French Canadians and Métis constituting the majority of the region&#x27;s population. 

In 1869, the government of Canada dispatched surveyors to survey Rupert&#x27;s Land, with the transfer of the territory expected to occur in the next year. However, Louis Riel and a group of Métis took control of Red River Colony, and declared a provisional government; refusing entry to Canadian government surveyors and resulting in the Red River Rebellion. The provisional government provided a list of terms for the colony&#x27;s entry into Canadian Confederation, including land provisions for the Métis, and linguistic and religious rights for its francophone Catholic population. The Canadian government eventually consented to the terms, with Manitoba formally made a province of confederation in the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; in 1870, with English and French made the province&#x27;s official language.

In 1871, there were about 5,500 francophones in the province almost all of whom were Métis, and comprised more than half of the province&#x27;s population. However within the next ten years, francophones became a demographic minority in Manitoba as settlers from Ontario moved into the province in large numbers. In 1890, the provincial government moved to remove the linguistic rights of francophones, with the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba passing an Act that made the English language the sole official language of the province.

In the same year, the province moved to eliminate its separate school system, used predominantly by the francophone Catholic population of Manitoba. The resulting issue, the Manitoba Schools Question, became a contentious national issue between English and French Canada. In 1896, the provincial and federal governments reached a compromise in which the separate school system would not be re-instituted, but religious and French language instruction would take place in the secular school system under certain conditions, and where francophone numbers warranted it.

French language instruction continued to be permitted until March 1916, when the provincial legislature passed the &quot;Thornton Act&quot;, which repealed the aforementioned compromise, and forbade the use of any language other than English as the language of instruction in schools. The following act was passed in an effort to homogenize the province with English as its dominant language, after it received an influx of migrants from non-English speaking countries. After the &quot;Thornton Act&quot; was passed, the &quot;Association d’éducation des Canadiens français du Manitoba&quot; (AÉCFM) was formed by the Roman Catholic clergy, serving as a shadow ministry of education for Franco-Manitobans. The AÉCFM provided financial assistance for prospective francophone teachers, and encouraged francophone teachers to continue providing French language instruction illicitly. Francophone teachers who were able to continue teaching the French language were largely aided by the fact that the trustees of several school boards were effectively francophone-controlled. Additionally, many school inspectors that were sent to enforce the &quot;Thornton Act&quot; ignored infractions by francophone teachers; as they often relied on the AÉCFM to support their positions as inspectors.

Formally however, French language instruction was not reintroduced in Manitoba&#x27;s public school system until 1947, when it was introduced as a second language for secondary schools, and in 1955 for elementary schools. Use of the French language to teach other subjects was introduced in 1967, with teachers permitted to use the language for half of the school day. French would formally be reestablished as an official language of the provincial education system in 1970. 

An issue regarding the province&#x27;s official language emerged during the late 1970s, when a francophone Métis received a parking ticket written only in English. The case served as a basis for a successful constitutional challenge, where the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the 1890 act that made English the only language of the legislature, and judiciary, was unconstitutional, as it conflicted with section 23 of the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;. The decision effectively made the province a bilingual province again. However, the provincial government continued to move slowly in re-instituting bilingual programs, resulting in another Franco-Manitoban to use his own parking ticket to launch a legal challenge that all legislation from 1890 to 1979 passed only in English were unconstitutional. The resulting challenge caused significant tension between anglophones and Franco-Manitobans, with the &quot;Société franco-manitobaine&quot; offices firebombed in 1983. A reference question was eventually posed to the supreme court, who ruled in &quot;Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights&quot;, that all legislation not printed in English and French were invalid; although did provide the provincial government a grace period to correct any unilingual documents.

Another supreme court decision in 1993 ruled that francophone minority were afforded the right to manage and control their own educational facilities. In order to comply with the supreme court&#x27;s ruling, the &quot;Public Schools Amendment (francophone Schools Governance) Act&quot; was passed, establishing the Franco-manitoban School Division in 1994.

In 2016, the &quot;Francophone Community Enhancement and Support Act&quot; was passed with unanimous support, and no vocal opposition from the anglophone majority of Manitoba, signalling the acceptance of francophone linguistic rights within the province.

==Politics==
The official language of the judiciary and legislature of Manitoba is English and French, under section 23 of the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;. The following section does not extend toward provincial government services. However, efforts to provide French language services have been undertaken since the province&#x27;s first French language policy was instituted in 1989, with French language access to provincial services available in areas where numbers warrant it.

The Francophone Affairs Secretariat serves as the main liaison between the provincial government and the Franco-Manitoban community. Conversely, the &quot;Société de la francophonie manitobaine&quot; serves as the main advocacy and lobby group for Franco-Manitobans.

==Education==
===Elementary and secondary===
French language education rights for minority francophone populations in Canada is guaranteed under section 23 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, in addition to section 23 of the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;.

However, French language instruction was formally banned from the province from 1916 to 1947; although instruction of the language continued in some schools illicitly. French was reintroduced as an official language of the public education system in 1970, with Franco-Manitobans given the right to control and manage school boards independent from their anglophone peers in 1993. During the 1970s, the provincial government established the &quot;Bureau de l’Éducation française&quot;, and the office of the Deputy Minister of French Education to oversee French language education.

The province&#x27;s public francophone schools is administered by the Franco-manitoban School Division, which had an enrolment of nearly 5,400 children throughout 23 schools during the 2015–16 academic year.

===Post-secondary===
The Université de Saint-Boniface, located in Winnipeg, is western Canada&#x27;s only francophone post-secondary university. The institution operates as an affiliated university of the publicly-funded University of Manitoba. In 2016 there were approximately 2,000 students enrolled with the Université de Saint-Boniface.

==Culture and media==
The Franco-Manitoban community is served by Radio-Canada&#x27;s CKSB (Ici Radio-Canada Première), CKSB-FM (Ici musique) and CBWFT-DT (Ici Radio-Canada Télé), the community radio station CKXL-FM and the weekly newspaper &quot;La Liberté&quot;.

In 1925, the Franco-Manitoban community founded Le Cercle Molière. It is the oldest French-language theatre organization in Canada.

The Festival du Voyageur, held annually since 1970 in Saint-Boniface, is a major celebration in the Franco-Manitoban community. Cinémental is an annual French-language film festival, staged at the Centre culturel Franco-Manitobain in Winnipeg.

<text>St. Boniface Cathedral () is a Roman Catholic cathedral in St. Boniface, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is an important building in Winnipeg, and is the principal church in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Boniface, serving the eastern part of Manitoba province as well as the local Franco-Manitoban community. The church sits in the centre of the city at 190 avenue de la Cathédrale. Before the fire on July 22, 1968, which destroyed the previous building on site, the church was a minor basilica.

The cathedral faces the Red River. In Verendrye Park is a statue of Pierre La Vérendrye by Joseph-Émile Brunet. Across the river is The Forks in Downtown Winnipeg.

==History==

In 1818, newly arrived Rev. Norbert Provencher and two colleagues constructed the first church on land on the east bank of the Red River donated by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk. The small log building measured 50 feet by 30 feet and served as chapel, residence and school. It was soon replaced with a larger building. In 1832, Provencher, now bishop, built the first cathedral. &quot;The bells of St. Boniface&quot; are mentioned in John Greenleaf Whittier&#x27;s 1859 poem &quot;The Red River Voyageur&quot;. &quot;On December 17, 1891, Whittier&#x27;s 84th birthday, Archbishop Taché had &quot;the bells of the Roman mission&quot; rung in the poet&#x27;s honour.&quot;

On December 14, 1860, a fire destroyed &quot;Provencher’s cathedral&quot;. In 1862, Bishop Taché went to Quebec to raise funds to rebuild the cathedral in stone. This second cathedral was somewhat smaller; the bell tower was completed eight years later.

Between 1888 and 1906, the number of Catholics in St. Boniface had increased from 2,154 to 4,615, almost all of them of French heritage. By 1900, St. Boniface was the fifth-largest city in the West and needed a larger cathedral. Local contractors Senecal and Smith were engaged to build a new cathedral to plans by Montreal architect Jean-Omer Marchand. On August 15, 1906, Monsignor Louis-Philippe Adélard Langevin dedicated the cathedral, which became one of the most imposing churches in Western Canada.

On July 22, 1968, the 1906 cathedral was damaged by a fire which destroyed many of the structure&#x27;s features and contents including the rose window, vestments, 1860 bells, and parish records. Only the façade, sacristy, and the walls of the old church remained. In 1972, a new, smaller cathedral, designed by Étienne Gaboury and Denis Lussier, was built behind the 1906 façade.

The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at St. Boniface Cathedral.

== Cathedral cemetery ==
The remains of Chief One Arrow, who died in the 1880s, were interred at the cemetery from his death until August 2007, when his body was exhumed and sent to One Arrow First Nation in Saskatchewan.

Other notable people buried in the cathedral cemetery include:

* Fr. Jean-Pierre Aulneau (1705-1736)
* Jean Baptiste de La Vérendrye (1713-1736)
* Louis Riel (1844–1885)
* Louis Riel, Sr. (1817–1864)
* John Rowand III (1812-1865)
* Ambroise-Dydime Lépine (1840–1923)
* Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière (1778–1855)
* Marie-Anne Gaboury (1780–1875)
* Norbert Provencher (1787–1853)

<text>Joseph-Norbert Provencher (February 12, 1787 – June 7, 1853) was a Canadian clergyman and missionary and one of the founders of the modern province of Manitoba. He was the first Bishop of Saint Boniface and was an important figure in the history of the Franco-Manitoban community.

==Life==
Provencher was born in Nicolet, Quebec, in 1787 to Jean-Baptiste and Élisabeth Proulx Provencher. His parents were farmers. Provencher was educated at the Nicolet College Classique and the Quebec Seminary. He was ordained a priest in 1811. For several years he served as curate in various parishes. In 1818 he and two other priests were sent by Joseph-Octave Plessis, Bishop of Quebec, to open a mission on the Red River in present-day Manitoba, where the majority of settlers were Irish and Scottish Catholics. He was tasked with converting the scattered Indian nations and to care for the &quot;delinquent Christians, who have adopted there the customs of the Indians.&quot; At the time, Provencher did not speak English.

They arrived at Fort Douglas in mid-July. Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk, a main share-holder in the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company gave the missionaries land on the east bank of the Red River. They immediately set to work to build a house before winter. Part of the building served as a chapel, which Provencher dedicated to famous missionary, Saint Boniface. The mission at Saint Boniface was highly successful; he baptized many of the local First Nations and Métis residents as well as many European settlers. In 1819, Provencher was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Quebec with the titular title of Bishop of Juliopolis, and vicar general for the northwest. He was consecrated at Trois-Rivières in 1822.

He returned to St. Boniface and built the school that is now known as the Université de Saint-Boniface and in 1832 Saint-Boniface Cathedral. In 1838, he founded a school to teach the weaving of wool provided by sheep brought into the colony. The Canadian settlers resisted his efforts to regularize concubinage with Indian and Metis women and preferred &quot;this liberty of being able to get rid of their wives.&quot;

In 1844, Provencher was appointed head of the newly-formed Vicariate Apostolic of James Bay, which was elevated to the Diocese of Northwest in 1847, and he was appointed its first bishop. It was renamed the Diocese of Saint Boniface in 1851.

In 1843, Provencher went to Europe to recruit some religious men and women. In 1846, despite the misgivings of the superior in Canada, Eugène de Mazenod, Bishop of Marseille and founder of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate dispatched two priests to the vicariate. In 1850, Alexandre-Antonin Taché O.M.I. was named coadjutor bishop to Bishop Provencher. He established Indian missions at Lac Sainte-Anne not far from Fort Edmonton, and Saint-Jean Baptiste in Île-à-la-Crosse. He brought the Grey Nuns to the Canadian Northwest. In 1860 three Grey Nuns arrived Saint-Jean Baptiste, and founded a school and a hospital.

Provencher stood six feet four inches, and had a noble bearing. He is described as &quot;moral, humble, tenacious, and devout.&quot;

Bishop Provencher died at Saint Boniface, Manitoba, on June 7, 1853, at the age of 66. He is commemorated by Provencher Boulevard in Winnipeg and the Provencher Monument in the St. Boniface Cathedral Cemetery. His papers are in the Archives of the Archdiocese of Quebec and in the Archives of Manitoba.

<text>The Ottawa Valley (Vallée d&#x27;Outaouais) is the valley of the Ottawa River (Rivière des Outaouais), along the boundary between Eastern Ontario and the Outaouais, Quebec, Canada. The valley is the transition between the Saint Lawrence Lowlands and the Canadian Shield. Because of the surrounding shield, the valley is narrow at its western end and then becomes increasingly wide (mainly on the Ontario side of the river) as it progresses eastward. The underlying geophysical structure is the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben. Approximately 1.3 million people reside in the valley (&quot;and along its tributaries&quot;), around 80% of whom reside in Ottawa. The total area of the Ottawa Valley is 2.4 million ha (6 million ac). The National Capital Region area has just over 1.4 million inhabitants in both provinces.

Near the City of Ottawa, the Ottawa Valley merges with the St. Lawrence Valley to the south to create a delta of flat farmland stretching unbroken from the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawrence River as far east as the island of Montreal, where the two rivers meet. The area is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Lower Ottawa Valley,&quot; in contrast with the &quot;Upper Ottawa Valley&quot; west of Ottawa, but the name is not common, and most people think of the Ottawa Valley as only the upper portion.

From west to east, communities in the Ottawa Valley include Mattawa, Deep River (with nearby Chalk River, the site of Canada&#x27;s nuclear reactor program), Petawawa (a major Canadian military base), Pembroke (where Samuel de Champlain landed briefly), Fort Coulonge, Shawville, Renfrew, Quyon, Arnprior, Ottawa (the nation&#x27;s capital), Rockland, L&#x27;Orignal, Hawkesbury, and Rigaud and Almonte, Round Lake Centre, Dacre, Douglas, Hyndford, Scotch Bush, Osceola and Barr Line.

==History==

The entire Ottawa Valley is claimed to be within Omàmiwininiwak (Algonquin Country traditional territory) and is presently under land claim. The entire territory south of the Ottawa river was conquered by the Iroquois during the French-Indian War/Seven Years&#x27; War, who then left it to the British Crown when they relocated to upstate New York. As a result the majority of Algonquins reside on the Quebec (north) side of the border, where all but two Algonquin communities are located. However, there are many Algonquin communities and individuals not recognized as such by the Government of Canada under the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. These individuals are referred to as &quot;non-status Indians&quot;. Ardoch Algonquin First Nation is one such community located in the Ottawa Valley fighting for the return of the land they lost to the Iroquois. As a relatively recent adaptation resulting from the economic pressures of the encroachment of non-native settling of the valley, the Algonquin First Nation is unevenly distributed within their territory. 

After the arrival of European settlers in North America, the first major industry of the Ottawa Valley was fur trading. The valley was part of the major cross-country route for French-Canadian Voyageurs, who would paddle canoes up the Ottawa River as far as Mattawa and then portage west through various rivers and lakes to Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. Later, lumber became the valley&#x27;s major industry, and it is still important in the far western part where the valley is narrow and little farmland is available. Today, the vast majority of the valley&#x27;s residents live at its eastern end in Ottawa and its suburbs, where government and technology are major industries.

In the areas of Morrison&#x27;s Island and Allumette Island there were many archaeological sites found from the earlier years of the Algonquin First Nations tribes. Many of these sites were found by the late Clyde C. Kennedy, who was a student of history; he was very interested in history and worked hard while researching the sites. The items found on the different sites are dated from about five thousand years ago to about two thousand years ago, and are a range of different things from native copper, to spear heads.

===Major settlements in the Upper Ottawa Valley===

Petawawa is a town located in Renfrew County, in the Ottawa Valley. It was thought to have been first settled by the Algonquian peoples and the name comes from their language meaning &quot;where one hears the noise of the water&quot;. Samuel de Champlain passed through the area and it was used as an important location for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Many of the first settlers were of Irish, Scottish, and later German origin. Today Petawawa is the home of one of the largest Canadian Forces Land Force Command bases in Canada CFB Petawawa.

Pembroke is located in Renfrew County on the Ottawa River. It is known as “the heart of the Ottawa Valley”. It was established in 1828 by pioneers and became a centre for the logging industry. Today, it is the largest regional service centre between Ottawa and North Bay.

===Historical notes===

Samuel de Champlain spent the years between 1613 and 1615 traveling the Ottawa River with Algonquin and Huron guides. He was the first documented European to see the Ottawa Valley. When Champlain first arrived there the Huron, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Outaouais tribes were living in the Valley. In charting the new land Champlain inaugurated the route that would be used by French fur traders for the next 200 years.*Between 1847 and 1879 a &quot;horse railway&quot; was used to portage passengers from the Ottawa River steamboat in a horse-drawn car for 5.5 kilometres along the wooded shore, around the Chats Falls, on the Quebec side of the river between the ghost villages of Pontiac Village and Union Village, near Quyon Quebec, to another steamboat to continue their journey upriver.

==Language==

English and French are both commonly spoken throughout the Ottawa Valley on both sides of the river. The Counties of Prescott and Russell County, in the Ottawa Valley, has the highest concentration of francophones in Canada west of Quebec. The variant of French spoken in this area of the province is also based on Quebec French, but distinctly different from that of the Outaouais region.

===Valley twang===
Regional English accents are rare west of Québec, but because of its isolation before the arrival of the railways and also by the mixture of the dominant French, Irish and Scottish populations, the valley at one time developed a distinctive dialect, referred to as the Ottawa Valley Twang. Many traces of it can still be heard today, especially in the valley&#x27;s more isolated western portions.

==Music and musical heritage==

The Ottawa Valley has rich musical heritage that finds its roots in the music traditions of Irish and French immigrants. The music and traditions continued and developed in the lumber camps that are storied part of the Ottawa River lumber industry. Traditions continued in the Valley&#x27;s festivals and hotels. Of these, Lennox Gavan&#x27;s Hotel in Quyon, Quebec and Fred Meilleur&#x27;s Chapeau Hotel on L&#x27;Ile aux Allumettes (now burned down), Quebec were particularly influential. Legendary performer and songwriter Mac Beattie and the Melodiers were also large influences on keeping the Ottawa Valley&#x27;s musical culture vibrant and living. Today, many performers keep the musical traditions alive, including Gail Gavan, Terry McLeish, April Verch and Trevor Grahl.

==Food==

The Ottawa Valley has a rich beef and corn farming community. There are a great many local breweries spread about the valley. The village of Killaloe is also the birthplace of the pastry known as a &quot;beaver tail&quot;.

==Transportation==

There are two 400-series highways which service the Ottawa Valley region on the southern side (Ontario side) of the Ottawa River, Highway 417 (The Queensway) which runs east–west through Ottawa and Highway 416 (The Veterans Memorial Highway) which runs north–south. To the west of Ottawa, Highway 417 eventually ends near Arnprior, where it continues westward as the two-lane Highway 17. In Ottawa there is a split in the Queensway near Cyrville and Pineview where Highway 174 branches off from Highway 417 and runs further north. East of Ottawa Highway 174 eventually ends and becomes County Road 17 again, and both it and Highway 417 continue eastwards to eventually merge near the Quebec border. At its northernmost point Highway 416 connects to Highway 417 in Ottawa near Nepean, and at its southernmost point it connects with Highway 401 near Prescott.

On the Northern side (Quebec side) of the Ottawa river Autoroute 5 runs primarily North-South through Gatineau starting from the Macdonald Cartier Bridge. It eventually becomes Quebec Route 105 further north. Route 148 runs primarily east–west through Gatineau and Hull; however, to the west of Hull it goes north-westward to south-eastern in order to follow the direction of the Ottawa River.

There are five major road bridges which cross the Ottawa River in the Ottawa area. There are also three road bridges to the west of the city and one to the east, all along Country Road 17 and Route 148. There are also a number of ferries at various points along the river which can transport people and vehicles across.

Part of the Trans Canada Railway passes through the Ottawa Valley. Via Rail operates passenger trains to and from Ottawa and other towns in the Ottawa Valley. The main passenger runs which operate from the region are Ottawa to Montreal and Ottawa to Toronto. The closest cities along the rail line to Ottawa are Montreal to the east of Ottawa and Brockville to the South. Freight trains also operate on the railway and Ottawa has a sizable train yard. A new commuter rail line between Ottawa and Pembroke is in the planning stages, along the Beachburg spur line.

The Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport, ICAO Code CYOW operates both flights to other major Canadian cities and other international airports. The airport is also a major hub for diplomats and international figures to come into Canada. Major airlines such as Air Canada, West jet, American Airlines and First Air use the airport consistently. The airport is also home to two flight training colleges on the north side of the field. It is Canada&#x27;s 7th busiest airport.

==Notable people==

Among the well-known people who hail from the Ottawa Valley, are former governor-general and broadcaster Adrienne Clarkson, Alanis Morissette, Margaret Atwood, Lorne Greene, railroad builder Michael James Heney,Guy Lafleur,Bryan Murray, Terry Murray, Frank Finnigan, Bruce Cockburn, Peter Jennings, Ryan Reynolds, Matthew Perry, Dan Aykroyd, Mark Redman, Norm Macdonald, Tom Green, Rich Little, Paul Anka, Alan Verch and Princess Margriet, sister of Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands.

Many Ottawa natives have excelled in the athletic world, particularly winter sports. Barbara Ann Scott was world figure skating champion and won the gold medal at St. Moritz, Switzerland in 1948. Skier Ann Heggtveit won a gold medal at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California. Elizabeth Manley won the silver medal for women&#x27;s figure skating at the Calgary Winter Olympics in 1988. The Clifford family has long been associated with skiing in the Ottawa area. Linda Thom won Olympic gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Francis Amyott, from the Britannia Club, won the single canoeing event when it was held for the first time at the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936.

Two Ontario premiers came from the Ottawa Valley - Premier Howard Ferguson (Kemptville) in the 1920s and Premier Dalton McGuinty (Ottawa), who became premier in 2003.

==&quot;Hockey Country&quot;==

The public relations office of the Ottawa Senators ice hockey team call Ottawa and the Valley &quot;hockey country&quot;. Indeed, it is the home not only of the once prominent Senators, which folded in 1934 and came back in 1992, but also of such famous NHL builders as Tommy Gorman and Ambrose O&#x27;Brien. With the Senators&#x27; arena &quot;Canadian Tire Centre (CTC)&quot;, originally named the &quot;Palladium&quot;, located in Kanata, Ontario, which links Ottawa with the Valley, residents of the Upper Ottawa Valley can easily access the games. The CTC is the home of the &quot;Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame&quot;, several restaurants, a fitness complex and several businesses. The CTC, including the standing room, has a capacity of holding 20,500 people for any event. Many of the members of the Senator&#x27;s coaching and management staff in 2010 hail from, or have strong connections to, the town of Shawville.

The Ottawa Valley&#x27;s Renfrew Millionaires, the creation of lumber baron O&#x27;Brien, was a small-town professional hockey team that won the league championship in 1910. Ottawa and the valley are also the home of such outstanding players as Frank Nighbor, Aurel Joliat, Frank &quot;King&quot; Clancy, Frank Boucher, Kurtis Foster and Denis Potvin; the latter was the star defenceman of the New York Islanders dynasty of the late 1970s. Ottawa&#x27;s Brian Kilrea holds the record as the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s longest-serving coach with a record number of games behind the bench of the Ottawa 67&#x27;s junior hockey team. The 67&#x27;s themselves are something of a legend, having a loyal following that results in sellout games almost every time they step on the ice. The Ottawa 67&#x27;s play hockey at Lansdowne Park which used to be home to the Ottawa Senators. Lansdowne has a capacity of over 9,682 seats. The Ottawa 67&#x27;s have won only two memorial cups (1984, 1999) since they first started in 1967.

==Geography==

The Ottawa Valley covers over 7,645 square kilometres. Some 12,800 years ago, glaciers retreated from what is now the Ottawa Valley region, leaving the area covered by the Champlain Sea for thousands of years. Ten thousand years ago the water retreated and land emerged, exposing fossils preserved in limestone, particularly in Eganville along the Bonnechere River and the historical site of the Bonnechere Caves and its subterranean river caverns.

More than half of the Ottawa Valley is now wilderness. Renfrew County, located in the heart of the Ottawa Valley, is the largest county in Ontario. (&quot;outside of &quot;districts&quot;, administrative regions in Northern Ontario&quot;). There are over 900 lakes and four major river systems in the Ottawa Valley. Ottawa itself is at the confluence of three rivers. These are the Ottawa, Gatineau and Rideau rivers.

==The river==

The Ottawa River is 1,130 kilometres long with a watershed of 140,000 km squared. Its source is Lac Capimitchigama in Quebec. The Ottawa River was first navigated and settled by the Huron, Algonquin, Iroquois and Outaouais people. The Ottawa River bears the name of an aboriginal tribe that traded on the waterway; the &quot;Outaouais&quot; which is French for Ottawa. The Ottawa River provided the means for entrepreneurs to start up their logging business. The River watershed had unlimited resources, loose regulations, and cheap labour pools which allowed the entrepreneurs to quickly increase control over the timber trade. Many people involved in the logging industry took advantage of the waterway and built their empires because of the fast-moving waters and forests along the River. These loggers played a crucial role in the development of the valley community as they guided logs downriver this boost is what led to the development of major towns and cities such as Ottawa and Gatineau. The Algonquin people called the Ottawa River &quot;Kitchissippi&quot;, which means “Great River”. The Algonquin word Kichesippirini means &quot;Big River People&quot;. The name Petawawa comes from the Algonquin language meaning “where one hears a noise like this.”

==Flora and fauna==

More than 400 species of animals live in the Ottawa Valley. The white trillium, which grows throughout the Ottawa Valley, has been Ontario&#x27;s provincial floral emblem since 1937. Its white blossom is associated with peace and hope. White pine, the Ontario provincial tree, was the most commercially important tree during the heyday of the logging industry in the 19th century. It was exported to Europe and used for building the masts of sailing ships. Winter was the best season for cutting timber as trees fell more easily when their sap wasn’t running and ice and snow made it easier to drag the timber. Spring was the season when the loggers would “drive” the logs downriver.

<doc id="438670" wikidata="Q252819" url="?curid=438670" title="Baoguo Temple (Zhejiang)">
<text>The Baoguo Temple (, ) is a former Mahayana Buddhist temple located in the Jiangbei district, north of Ningbo, in Zhejiang Province, People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is noted as the second-oldest surviving wooden structure in southern China since the main hall of the present temple dates back to 1013 AD during the Northern Song dynasty.

==History==
The temple was originally called the Lingshan Temple (, ), but in 880 AD, during the Tang dynasty it was renamed the Baoguo Temple. The main hall was rebuilt in 1013 AD, during the Northern Song dynasty, and is one of the oldest and most well preserved wooden constructions in China. The temple also contains columns dating to the Tang dynasty, a hall built during the Ming dynasty, and two halls and towers of the Qing dynasty.

Today the temple is no longer a temple but a tourist attraction, and many of its rooms and halls are used to house various exhibitions, including:
*Guanyin statues
*Confucian bronzes
*Ningbo furniture
*Traditional Chinese wedding attire
*Carved stone screens
*Miscellaneous architectural pieces from the temple compound
*Famous places around China

== Transport ==
The temple can be accessed by bus 332 from Ningbo city. The ride takes approximately 35 minutes.

<text>USS &quot;Wasp&quot; (LHD-1) is a United States Navy multipurpose amphibious assault ship, and the lead ship of her class. She is the tenth USN vessel to bear the name since 1775, with the last two ships named &quot;Wasp&quot; being aircraft carriers. She was built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding division of Litton in Pascagoula, Mississippi. &quot;Wasp&quot; and her sister ships are the first specifically designed to accommodate new Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) for fast troop movement over the beach, and Harrier II (AV-8B) Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing (V/STOL) jets which provide close air support for the assault force. She can also accommodate the full range of Navy and Marine Corps helicopters, the tiltrotor MV-22 Osprey, the F-35B Lightning II multi-role fighter, conventional landing craft, and amphibious vehicles.

==Specifications==
To carry out her primary mission, &quot;Wasp&quot; has an assault support system that synchronizes the simultaneous horizontal and vertical flow of troops, cargo and vehicles throughout the ship. Two aircraft elevators service the hangar bay and flight deck. Six cargo elevators, each , are used to transport material and supplies from the cargo holds throughout the ship to staging areas on the flight deck, hangar bay and vehicle storage area. Cargo is transferred to waiting landing craft docked within the ship&#x27;s , well deck. Helicopters in the hangar bay or on the flight deck are cargo-loaded by forklift.

===Medical facilities===

&quot;Wasp&quot; has medical and dental facilities capable of providing intensive medical assistance to 600 casualties, whether combat incurred or brought aboard ship during humanitarian missions. The ship&#x27;s corpsmen also provide routine medical/dental care to the crew and embarked personnel. Major medical facilities include four main and two emergency operating rooms, four dental operating rooms, x-ray rooms, a blood bank, laboratories, and patient wards. In addition, three battle dressing stations are located throughout the ship, as well as a casualty collecting area at the flight deck level. Medical elevators rapidly transfer casualties from the flight deck and hangar bay to the medical facilities.

===Accommodations===
For the comfort of the 1,075 crewmembers and 2,200 embarked troops, all crewed spaces and berthing areas are individually heated and air conditioned. Berthing areas are subdivided to provide semi-private spaces without adversely affecting efficiency. Onboard recreational facilities include a Library Multi-Media Resource Center with Internet access, a weight room, and satellite television capabilities.

===Propulsion===
&quot;Wasp&quot;″s two steam propulsion plants generate a total of 400 tons of steam per hour. The propulsion system develops , powering the ship to speeds in excess of . USS &quot;Wasp&quot; was built using more than 21,000 tons of steel, 400 tons of aluminum, of electrical/electronic cables, of piping and tubing of various types and sizes, and of ventilation ducting. &quot;Wasp&quot; weighed more than 27,000 tons when moved onto the Ingalls floating dry-dock on 30 July 1987 for launch on 4 August 1987, becoming the largest man-made object rolled across land. In 1996, the ship was fitted with the Advanced Combat Direction System (ACDS).

==Ship history==
===1990s===
On 20 June 1991, &quot;Wasp&quot; departed homeport for her maiden six-month Mediterranean deployment.
In February 1993, she left her port on an emergency deployment to Somalia to participate in the United Nations intervention: Operation Restore Hope. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell landed on the ship that April for a discussion of military tactics taking place in and around Mogadishu. Following that, she assisted with another operation off the coast of Kuwait. She later made stops in Toulon, France, and Rota, Spain, en route to her home port in Norfolk, Virginia. In 1998, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.

===2000s===
With the exception of deployments noted below, from 2004 to 2012, &quot;Wasp&quot; was not deployed as often or as long as other LHDs, as she was assigned to Joint Strike Fighter F-35B Lightning II testing and kept close to the U.S. as much as possible.

;Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom

In February 2004, &quot;Wasp&quot; set sail to take the Marines of 1/6 Marine Regiment and HMM-266 Rein to Afghanistan. They arrived at the end of March to offload the Marines, then returned to the U.S. to pick up more Marines from HMH-461 and transported them to Djibouti. After offloading HMH-461 in Djibouti, they picked up the Marines of HMM-266 Rein from Kuwait in August 2004, and returned to Norfolk, Virginia mid-September 2004. On 7 July 2006, Vice President Dick Cheney visited &quot;Wasp&quot;. He gave a speech honoring the efforts of the Expeditionary Strike Group in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

&quot;Wasp&quot; was the first ship to deploy the V-22 Osprey, doing so in October 2007, by carrying VMM-263&#x27;s ten MV-22B Ospreys to Iraq to participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom. &quot;Wasp&quot; also served as the platform for the program&#x27;s first Sea Trials in December 1990, involving the third and fourth Osprey prototypes. &quot;Wasp&quot; was the principal attraction at Fleet Week 2007 in New York City.
On 4 October 2009, &quot;Wasp&quot; deployed from her base at Norfolk Naval Station in Norfolk, Virginia on a three-month voyage down the Atlantic coast to the Caribbean, with Destroyer Squadron 40 and an embarked Marine Air-Ground Task Force. The 1,100 sailors and 365 embarked Marines conducted operations and exercises in the U.S. 4th Fleet area of responsibility. The operation, called Southern Partnership Station, is part of a maritime strategy, which focuses on building interoperability and cooperation in the region while meeting common challenges. In mid-October 2009, &quot;Wasp&quot; set anchor at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba and disembarked Marines who were assigned to training status for approximately three months while &quot;Wasp&quot; went underway.

===2010s===

In September 2007, &quot;Wasp&quot; sailed to Nicaragua to offer assistance to the victims of Hurricane Felix.
On 29 June 2010, &quot;Wasp&quot; was one of the 18 international vessels taking part in the 100th anniversary celebrations of the Canadian Navy in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Canadian and international warships were reviewed by Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In 2011, &quot;Wasp&quot; was modified for F-35B testing, including replacing a Sea Sparrow launcher with monitoring equipment. She returned to sea on 7 July 2011.
On 3 October 2011, the F-35B made its first vertical landing at sea on &quot;Wasp&quot;. On 5 October 2011, &quot;Wasp&quot; successfully launched her first F-35B.

On 30 January 2012, &quot;Wasp&quot; set sail for Operation Bold Alligator, the largest amphibious exercise conducted by U.S. forces in the last decade. The exercise took place from 30 January to 12 February, both afloat and ashore in and around Virginia and North Carolina. In May 2012, &quot;Wasp&quot; participated in New York&#x27;s Fleet Week, docking at Pier 92 on the Hudson River and offering tours of the ship to the general public. In July 2012, &quot;Wasp&quot; visited Boston for Fleet Week 2012 and Fourth of July festivities. On 30 October 2012, &quot;Wasp&quot; was sent towards the Hurricane Sandy impact area in case the USN was needed to support the disaster relief efforts. In June 2016, &quot;Wasp&quot; deployed for a six-month tour to the Middle East In October 2016, the US Navy announced that &quot;Wasp&quot; would deploy to Sasebo, Japan in late 2017, replacing her sister ship , which will be moved to San Diego, California. On 1 August 2016, Marine AV-8B Harriers from &quot;Wasp&quot; began strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya as part of crewed and uncrewed airstrikes on targets near Sirte, launching at least five times within two days.

The USN planned to deploy &quot;Wasp&quot; to the Asia-Pacific region in 2017 with a squadron of 16 F-35Bs. In September 2017, &quot;Wasp&quot; became the first U.S. warship to arrive in the Caribbean to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance in the wake of Hurricane Irma. On 3 March 2018, &quot;Wasp&quot; departed Sasebo, Japan for a routine patrol of the Indo-Pacific region. A detachment of 6 F-35Bs from VMFA-121 were deployed with the ship, marking the first operational shipboard deployment for the F-35B.

On 27 May 2019, President Donald J. Trump landed in a helicopter aboard the &quot;Wasp&quot; anchored near Yokosuka, Japan to deliver Memorial Day remarks to the troops during his visit to Japan for a state dinner with Emperor of Japan, Emperor Naruhito and Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe.

===2020s===
From early 2021 through July 2022, &quot;Wasp&quot; underwent a comprehensive refurbishment at BAE Systems Platforms &amp; Services.

In September 2024, U.S. service members embarked aboard the &quot;Wasp&quot; were the victims of an assault in İzmir, Turkey.

==Coat of arms==

Dark blue and gold are the traditional colors of the US Navy. Blue alludes to the sea, the theater of Naval Operations. Gold is for excellence. The chevron, a traditional symbol for support, represents the amphibious assault mission of the ship. It resembles a wave move to shore and refers to the deployment of men, women and cargo. The wings highlight USS &quot;Wasp&quot;″s aviation heritage and capabilities. The modern ship with crossed officers sword and enlisted cutlass adapted from the surface warfare emblems represents leadership, teamwork and the ship&#x27;s mission in surface operations. The pile of a sharp pointed &quot;V&quot; shape is expressive of assault, combat readiness and victory. The wasp, with its well-developed wings and ability to administer painful stings, epitomizes quick striking power. The stars recall two of the previous ships named &quot;Wasp&quot;, CV-7 and CV-18, aircraft carriers that earned two and eight battle stars respectively for World War II service. The red disc or sun refers to World War II Japan and the Pacific Theater where these aircraft carriers saw heavy combat action. The tridents are symbolic of sea power and weaponry.

<doc id="438676" wikidata="Q257622" url="?curid=438676" title="Bandra">
<text>Bandra ([bæːɳɖɾa]) is a coastal suburb located in Mumbai, the largest city of the Konkan division in Maharashtra, India. The area is located to the immediate north of the River Mithi, which separates Bandra from the Mumbai City district. It is the third-largest commercial hub in Maharashtra, after the Mumbai City and Pune, primarily aided by the Bandra Kurla Complex.

Before the opening of Khar Road railway station on 1 July 1924, Bandra was a larger area and included the present day Khar neighbourhood. It was considered too large a suburb to be served by one railway station, and a railway station was established to give the northern part of Bandra closer access to the Western Railway line. This eventually led to Khar being considered a separate suburb. However, to this day, the two adjoined suburbs make up one homogeneous zone. A number of prominent residents of Bandra are celebrities or VIPs who are active in Bollywood, media, cricket or politics. 

==History==
The original name of the suburb &quot;Vandre&quot; originates from the Marathi word for monkeys, or &quot;Vandr&quot;.&quot;However, another theory suggests that &quot;Bandra&quot; possibly originates from the Persian word for port, or &quot;bandar.&quot; It is described by Duncan Forbes&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary, Hindustani and English&quot; (1848) as &quot;a city; an emporium; a port, harbor; a trading town to which numbers of foreign merchants resort&quot;. In Konkani, &quot;bandar&quot; is a loanword from Parsi (Persian) meaning &quot;harbour&quot; or &quot;port&quot;.

The area along with much of the Konkan region, was ruled by the Silhara dynasty in the 12th century. Bandra was a tiny fishing village inhabited by Kolis (fishermen) and salt farmers. The area was part of Portuguese Bombay territory extending from Damaon to Chaul, before its acquisition by the English East India Company.

===Indo-Portuguese era===
In 1534, Diego da Silveira, a pirate from the Mediterranean, entered Bandra&#x27;s creek and burned the fishing town he found there. With that, Bandra came under the rule of the Portuguese Goa.

A period of Christianisation began in Bandra. Father Conceicao Rodrigues, a Catholic priest, was instrumental in increasing the Church&#x27;s prominence in Bandra. In 1580, he baptised about 2,000 fishermen. By the time he died 11 years later, Father Gomes&#x27; &quot;invincible strength of soul&quot;, as one historian describes it, had helped convert close to 6,000 people in the area. Father Gomes also established St Andrew&#x27;s Church.

Bandra officially became a possession of the Portuguese East Indies, when the Sultanate of Cambay ceded Bandra and adjacent areas via the Treaty of Bassein (1534), which was signed aboard the brig named &quot;Sao Mateus&quot; (St Matthew) at Vasai (Bassein) harbour, aided by Governor-General Nuno da Cunha and Diego da Silveira. The Portuguese enfeoffed (gave) Bandra, Kurla, Mazgaon and four other villages in 1548 to António Pessoa; as a reward for his military services. This was confirmed by the Royal Chancellery on 2 February 1550.

As these villages were given for a period of &quot;two lives&quot;, they reverted to the Portuguese Crown after the death of Isabel Botelha, Pessoa&#x27;s widow. In 1568, the Jesuits who had applied for acquisition of these villages in anticipation of Isabel&#x27;s death, obtained them from the Portuguese viceroy in Goa, they received royal confirmation from Lisbon, in 1570.

In 1661, when Charles II of England married Catherine of Portugal, the Seven Islands of Bombay were given away as part of the dowry of Catherine Braganza. However, Salsette island, on which Bandra laid, was not part of this treaty and remained with the Portuguese.

The Portuguese Empire built additional chapels, oratories&amp; churches in Bandra, one of the earliest being St Andrew&#x27;s Church in 1575. Their Jesuit missionaries, who learned local languages and cultures, attracted many Indian converts to Western Christianity (Catholicism) among the natives of the island. Their descendants continued their membership of the six Catholic parish churches—Mount Carmel, St. Peter&#x27;s, St Andrew&#x27;s, St Theresa&#x27;s, St Anne&#x27;s and St Francis d&#x27;Assisi; that lie within an area of four square kilometres.

Bandra became part of English territory with the signing of the Treaty of Surat in 1775, but was retroceded to the Marathas in 1779 during the First Anglo-Maratha War. In 1802, Baji Rao II signed the Treaty of Bassein with the English, surrendering sovereignty and again ceding Bandra, and it remained under British control until 14 August 1947.

Arrival of Railways and development: On 12 April 1867, the first railway service was inaugurated, with one train per day between Virar and Bombay, as part of the then private rail company, BB&amp;CI which was the earlier form of Western Railway. A grand railway station building for Bandra was inaugurated in 1869. The innovative aspects used in the design of this structure are visible to this day. On closer scrutiny, it is evident how railway tracks bunched together make up each of the iron pillars, that hold up the roof over the platforms. In 1873, with growing demands, the frequency of trains available was increased to 24 each day. In the early 1900s, the affluent Pathare Prabhu community lived in South Mumbai, and used their quaint bungalows in the Khar part of Bandra as weekend dwellings. Khar Danda was one of the original villages of the erstwhile larger Bandra. Back then, the local Bandra railway station was felt considerably far to alight from trains and hire &#x27;tangas&#x27; (horse carriages) to get to their bungalows by these Bandra residents. Keeping these factors and Bandra&#x27;s growing population in mind, a new railway station named &#x27;Khar Road&#x27; was introduced adjoining Bandra Railway station on 1 July 1924. This development is the primary reason that the Khar part of Bandra started being referred to as a suburb by itself. As late as the 1930s, Bandra had only one bus service from Pali Naka, Hill Road to the Railway station. Other people just walked to the nearest railway station. After World War II, the building boom began with an aim to accommodate immigrants. As of 2018, 940 trains stop daily at Bandra railway station.

Bandra was raised to the status of a municipality in 1876 and was then expanded. In 1950, following independence, it was merged into the Bombay Municipal Corporation to form the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay. Bandra consisted of many villages, among them Sherly, Malla, Rajan, Kantwady, Waroda, Ranwar, Boran, Khar Danda, Pali, and Chuim. These have almost been lost to urban development of the island.

====Mount Mary&#x27;s Church====
The Bandra Fair is held during the eight days of the Octave of the Nativity of Our Lady, beginning 8 September, when people throng the church.

====Educational institutions====
The first school founded in Bandra after Bombay passed on to the English was St Andrew&#x27;s Parish School, started by Fr. Francisco de Melo in 1780 to teach catechism to the children of the parish. This later became St. Andrew&#x27;s High School. The school is located in Bandra West.

St. Theresa&#x27;s High School grew out of St. Andrew&#x27;s Indian Christians&#x27; School, housed in a very dilapidated building situated in Old Khar. This school was founded in 1918. It was taken over by the Society of Divine Word (S.V.D). in 1952. It is counted among the best schools in Mumbai.

St. Stanislaus High School was founded in 1863 by the Society of Jesus. It started as a Native Boy&#x27;s orphanage. It became a high school in 1923 and was the first English medium school in the suburbs. Later, it grew to be a full-fledged educational institution for day-scholars as well as boarders. Cardinal Gracias High School is a convent school located in Bandra East. St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent High School for girls is run by the nuns of the congregation of the Daughters of the Cross in Bandra West. It was built in 1865 (Bandra was then known as Bandora) and boasts a chapel. The school has produced illustrious alumni over the years. R.D. National College was originally set up in 1922 in Hyderabad, Pakistan under the guidance of Annie Besant. In the run-up to the Partition of India, it was relocated to its present site in 1949 in Bandra. The Thadomal Shahani Engineering College was established in 1983 by the Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board.

The Rizvi Education Complex, located off Carter Road, comprises the Rizvi College of Arts, Science and Commerce (established in 1985); Rizvi High School (established in 1985); Rizvi College of Engineering (established in 1998); Rizvi College of Architecture; Rizvi College of Hotel Management &amp; Catering Technology; Rizvi Law College; Rizvi College of Education and the Rizvi College of Fashion Designing &amp; Creative Arts All are managed by the Rizvi Education Society, and may have the status of Muslim religious minority institution.

St. Andrew&#x27;s College of Arts, Science and Commerce is another famous college located in the heart of Bandra, just a few hundred metres away from St. Stanislaus High School. St. Andrews boasts of one of the best auditoriums in the city.

IES&#x27;s Management College an Research Centre is also located at Bandra Reclamation. It offers PGDM programs related to management and pharma.

====Bandra Lake====
Bandra Lake, also called Bandra Talao or Motha Reservoir, was constructed by a rich Konkani Muslim of Navapada (also spelled Naupada or Naopara), an adjoining village.

The lake was later acquired by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. It was officially renamed Swami Vivekanand Sarovar. Paddle boating facilities and pisciculture (fish farming) activities were operational in this lake during the 1990s but have since stopped. This lake is now a heritage structure of &quot;Heritage II&quot; status. The Portuguese also pronounced Bandra As Bandora.

===Development of Bandra as a commercial hub===

As traffic in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region worsened, especially in South Mumbai, there was increased demand to construct a business district outside of Mumbai, in the suburbs. In the mid-2000s, the city of Bandra started an audacious task to reclaim lands on the Mithi River in the eastern portion of the city, near the Kurla border. The newly formed Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) has attracted several equity and technology firms, such as Blackstone, Google, and Amazon, who chose Bandra instead of Mumbai City for its location, lower-cost of land, and new development.

As the last suburb before entering Mumbai City, Bandra has for a while been strained with traffic, particularly around the railway station and S.V. Road. The development of a business centre has only exacerbated the traffic problems, as unlike other commercial hubs, Bandra&#x27;s BKC is located between Bandra and Kurla stations and requires approximately 10-15 minute vehicular commute from either of the stations. Nearly 300,000 office-goers alight daily at Bandra Railway Station and take a taxi or bus to BKC. This has made Bandra among the busiest stations in India, surpassing Andheri and Bombay Central, and the second-busiest station in Maharashtra&#x27;s Western Railway after Churchgate railway station.

===Terror attacks===
In 1993, a group of terrorists attacked a hotel in Bandra in addition to other sites in the city.

==Urban art==
Bandra has a large collection of street art or graffiti. The paintings on walls are principally located in the vicinity of Chapel Road and Veronica Street, but prominent works are also visible near the Bandstand and Mount Mary Church. They consist of various types of graffiti, including pieces, stencils, tags, etc. Globally renowned artists such as Gomez have created works on these walls.
St+art Mumbai, Bollywood Art Project and Dharavi Art Room are some of the organisations that conduct various programs to encourage the artists. The programs have support from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Bandra was also home to the 37X46 metre (120X150 foot) portrait of Dadasaheb Phalke on the MTNL building at Bandra Reclamation. It was created by Ranjit Dahiya (from the Bollywood Art Project) and other artists including Yantr, Munir Bukhari and Nilesh Kharade as part of the St+art Mumbai festival in 2014. The mural was unveiled officially by Amitabh Bachchan and Piyush Pandey, but the building has been re-painted. It is reportedly Asia&#x27;s largest mural.

== In literature ==
Many of the characters in the book Bloodline Bandra by Godfrey Joseph Pereira (2014), are East Indian, including the protagonist, journalist, David Cabral, who reside in a village (hamlet) called Pali in Bandra. The book itself is set in the 1950s with the first half of the book having most of the action in Pali Village, a predominantly East Indian populace at the time.

==Geography==
Bandra is split by the local railway-line into West Bandra (Postal Code 400050) and East Bandra (Postal Code 400051). The part of Bandra located on the western side of the railway line developed into a fashionable suburb by the middle of the 20th century. Film director Mehboob Khan established the Mehboob Studios here in 1954. Soon the area became a center for the Indian movie industry, Bollywood. A recording studio was set up in the 1970s.

In the mid-to-late 1990s, the eastern part emerged as a commercial and administrative hub. It houses the Family Court, Bandra Kurla Commercial Complex, the office of the state housing development authority (MHADA) and the office of the District Collector. The residential quarters of the employees of the Maharashtra State Government are also located here.

Most roads and places in Bandra were given English names during British rule. They have been renamed over time but many are still popularly known by their old names.

* Neighbouring suburbs: Dharavi, Khar, Kurla, Mahim, Santa Cruz
* Arterial roads: Swami Vivekanand Road (S.V Road), Linking Road, Turner Road (Guru Nanak Marg), Hill Road (renamed Ramdas Nayak Marg), Carter Road (renamed Naushad Ali Marg), Navpada Road (Balsamant), Western Express Highway. The Bandra–Worli Sea Link connects the western part of Bandra to Worli by the sea route, thus diverting a lot of road traffic.


==Transport==
Bandra railway station is connected with the Western Railway and the Harbour Line, which is an offshoot of the suburban Central Railway. It also has a newly built terminus called Bandra Terminus in Bandra (E) from where trains bound for northern and western India are scheduled regularly. The important trains include the Bandra-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, Bandra-Indore Express, Bandra-Patna Express, Bandra-Jaipur Express, Bandra-Jodhpur Express and the Bandra-Amritsar Express.

Public transport also includes BEST buses, auto rickshaws and taxis, which are abundant. Bandra is the last southern point from Mumbai where auto rickshaws ply. Beyond Bandra, entering Mahim, only taxis are allowed to ply.

The Bandra–Worli Sea Link bridge connects Bandra West with Worli, located in central Mumbai. Due to Bandra&#x27;s central location, most parts of the city are easily accessible.

<text>This is an alphabetical list of plants used in [[herbalism]].

Phytochemicals possibly involved in biological functions are the basis of herbalism, and may be grouped as:
:*primary metabolites, such as carbohydrates and fats found in all plants
:*secondary metabolites serving a more specific function.

For example, some secondary metabolites are toxins used to deter predation, and others are pheromones used to attract insects for pollination. Secondary metabolites and pigments may have therapeutic actions in humans, and can be refined to produce drugs; examples are quinine from the cinchona, morphine and codeine from the poppy, and digoxin from the foxglove.

In Europe, apothecaries stocked herbal ingredients as traditional medicines. In the Latin names for plants created by Linnaeus, the word &quot;officinalis&quot; indicates that a plant was used in this way. For example, the marsh mallow has the classification &quot;Althaea officinalis&quot;, as it was traditionally used as an emollient to soothe ulcers. Pharmacognosy is the study of plant sources of phytochemicals.

Some modern prescription drugs are based on plant extracts rather than whole plants. The phytochemicals may be synthesized, compounded or otherwise transformed to make pharmaceuticals. Examples of such derivatives include aspirin, which is chemically related to the salicylic acid found in white willow. The opium poppy is a major industrial source of opiates, including morphine. Few traditional remedies, however, have translated into modern drugs, although there is continuing research into the efficacy and possible adaptation of traditional herbal treatments.

<doc id="438696" wikidata="Q1066624" url="?curid=438696" title="Brown rice">
<text>Brown rice is a whole grain rice with only the inedible outer hull removed. This kind of rice sheds its outer hull or husk but the bran and germ layer remain on, constituting the brown or tan colour of rice. White rice is the same grain without the hull, the bran layer, and the cereal germ. Red rice, gold rice, and black rice (also called purple rice) are all whole rice with differently pigmented outer layers.

==Cooking time==
Brown rice generally needs longer cooking times than white rice, unless it is broken or flour blasted (which perforates the bran without removing it). Studies in 2003 estimated a cooking time between 35 and 51 minutes. A shorter cooking time is necessary for &quot;converted&quot; or parboiled rice.

== Storage ==
Brown rice has a shelf life of approximately 6 months, but hermetic storage, refrigeration or freezing can significantly extend its lifetime. Freezing, even periodically, can also help control infestations of Indian meal moths.

==Nutrition==
Cooked, long-grain brown rice is 70% water, 26% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 1% fat. In a reference amount of , cooked brown rice supplies 123 calories of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of manganese (36% DV) and moderate source (11-17% DV) of magnesium, phosphorus, niacin, and thiamine. 

== Arsenic ==
Arsenic is in the natural environment and may be present in common grains, such as brown rice. Although rice may absorb arsenic more readily than other crops, rice remains as a staple of a well-balanced diet, particularly when fortified with micronutrients in infant rice cereal.

Cooking brown rice in hot water can reduce the content of inorganic arsenic by 40-60%, although this cooking method also diminishes the content of micronutrients.

== In Vietnam ==
Brown rice is widely cultivated in Vietnam, mainly in the northern and central provinces. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the area of brown rice cultivation in Vietnam in 2023 reached 150,000 hectares, with a production of 1.2 million tons. Brown rice has high economic value and is popular in the market. The price of brown rice is usually higher than white rice by 10-20%. Brown rice has great potential for development in Vietnam, and could become a major export product.

<text>Charles Michael Schwab (February 18, 1862 – September 18, 1939) was an American steel magnate. Under his leadership, Bethlehem Steel became the second-largest steel maker in the United States, and one of the most important heavy manufacturers in the world.

==Early life and education==
Schwab was born in Williamsburg, Pennsylvania, on February 18, 1862, the son of Pauline (née Farabaugh) and John Anthony Schwab. All four of his grandparents were Roman Catholic immigrants from Germany. 

Schwab was raised in Loretto, Pennsylvania, which he considered his hometown. His father, John, operated a livery stable in Loretto and also served as a mail-carrier. 

Schwab graduated from Saint Francis College in Loretto in 1877.

==Career==
===Carnegie Steel===

Schwab began his career as an engineer in Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s steelworks, starting as a stake-driver in the engineering corps of the Edgar Thomson Steel Works and Furnaces in Braddock, Pennsylvania. He was promoted often, including to the positions of general superintendent of Homestead Works in 1887, and general superintendent of the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in 1890. In 1897, at only 35 years of age, he became president of the Carnegie Steel Company. 

In 1901, he helped negotiate the secret sale of Carnegie Steel to a group of New York City–based financiers, led by J. P. Morgan. After the buyout, Schwab became the first president of the United States Steel Corporation, the company formed out of Carnegie&#x27;s former holdings.

===Bethlehem Steel===

In 1903, after several clashes with Morgan and fellow US Steel executive Elbert Gary, Schwab left the company to run the Bethlehem Shipbuilding and Steel Company, which ultimately became Bethlehem Steel, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The company had shipyards in California, Delaware, and New Jersey through its brief but fortunate involvement as one of the few solvent enterprises in United States Shipbuilding Company. 

Under Schwab&#x27;s leadership and that of Eugene Grace, Bethlehem Steel emerged as one of the largest independent steel producers in the world. A major part of the company&#x27;s success was the development of the H-beam, a precursor of today&#x27;s ubiquitous I-beam. Schwab was interested in mass-producing the wide flange steel beam, but that was a risky venture that required raising capital and building a large new plant, all to make a product whose ability to sell was unproven. In his most famous remark, Schwab told his secretary, &quot;I&#x27;ve thought the whole thing over, and if we are going bust, we will go bust big.&quot;

In 1908, Bethlehem Steel began making the beam, which revolutionized building construction and contributed to the age of the skyscraper. Its success helped make Bethlehem Steel the second-largest steel company in the world. Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, was incorporated, virtually as a company town, by uniting four previous villages. In 1910, Schwab broke the Bethlehem Steel strike by calling out the newly formed Pennsylvania State Police. Schwab successfully kept labor unions out of Bethlehem Steel throughout his tenure, although Bethlehem Steel unionized in 1941, two years after his death.

In 1911, Bethlehem Steel formed a company soccer team known as Bethlehem Steel F.C. Three years later, in 1914, Schwab took the team professional. Until its demise in 1930, the team won eight league championships, six American Cups, and five National Challenge Cups. It was considered among the greatest soccer teams in U.S. history. The company disbanded the team as a result of financial losses incurred during the internecine 1928–1929 &quot;Soccer Wars&quot; between American Soccer League and United States Football Association and the onset of the Great Depression in 1929.

During the first years of World War I, Bethlehem Steel had a virtual monopoly in contracts to supply the Allies with certain kinds of munitions. During this period, Schwab made many visits to Europe in connection with the manufacture and supply of munitions to the Allied governments. He circumvented American neutrality laws by funneling goods through Canada.

On April 16, 1918, Schwab became director general of Emergency Fleet Corporation, a board granted by Congress with master authority over all shipbuilding in the United States. He was appointed over Charles Piez, the former general manager of the corporation. President Wilson had specifically asked Schwab to assume this responsibility. Schwab&#x27;s biggest change to the shipbuilding effort was to abandon the cost plus profit contracting system that had been in place up to that time and begin issuing fixed-price contracts. After America&#x27;s entry into the war, he was accused of profiteering but was later acquitted.

Schwab was considered to be a risk taker and was highly controversial; Thomas Edison once famously called him the &quot;master hustler&quot;. Schwab&#x27;s lucrative contract providing steel to the Trans-Siberian Railroad came after he provided a $200,000 &quot;gift&quot; to the mistress of the Grand Duke Alexis Aleksandrovich. 

His innovative ways of dealing with his staff are given a mention in Dale Carnegie&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;, published in 1936. In 1928, Schwab was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal for &quot;outstanding services to the steel industry&quot;. In 1932, he was awarded the Melchett Medal by the British Institute of Fuel. In 1982, Schwab was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 2011, Schwab was inducted into the inaugural class of the American Metal Market Hall of Fame for his lifelong work in the U.S. steel industry.

==Personal life==

Schwab married Emma Eurana Dinkey (1859–1939) on May 1, 1883. Mrs. Schwab lived in Weatherly, Pennsylvania, and donated $85,000 to build a school there.

Schwab eventually became very wealthy. He moved to New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side, which at the time was considered the &quot;wrong&quot; side of Central Park, where he built &quot;Riverside&quot;, the most ambitious private house ever built in New York City. The $7 million 75-room house, designed by French architect Maurice Hébert, combined details from three French chateaux on a full city block. After Schwab&#x27;s death, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia turned down a proposal to make Riverside the official mayoral residence, deeming it too grandiose. It was eventually razed and replaced by an apartment block.

Schwab also owned a 44-room summer estate on 1,000 acres (4 km2) in Loretto, Pennsylvania, called &quot;&quot;, German for &quot;evergreen&quot;. The house featured opulent gardens and a nine-hole golf course. Rather than raze the existing house, Schwab had the mansion moved on rollers to a new location to make room for the new mansion. Schwab&#x27;s estate sold Immergrün after his death, and it is now Mount Assisi Friary owned by the Franciscan friars (Third Order Regular) who administer the adjacent Saint Francis University. The golf course, now known as “Immergrun Golf Club”, designed in 1917 by Donald Ross, is owned and operated by the university.

The gardens feature a cascading fountain modeled after features at Versailles and include sculptures by Paul Manship, known for the Prometheus sculpture at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan.

Schwab became notorious for his &quot;fast lane&quot; lifestyle including opulent parties, high-stakes gambling, and a string of extramarital affairs producing at least one child out of wedlock. The affairs and the out-of-wedlock child soured his relationship with his wife. He became an international celebrity when he &quot;broke the bank&quot; at Monte Carlo, and traveled in a $100,000 private rail car named &quot;Loretto&quot;. Even before the Great Depression, he had already spent most of his fortune, estimated at between $25 million and $40 million. Adjusted for inflation in the first decade of the 21st century, that equates to between $500 million and $800 million.

The stock market crash of 1929 finished off what years of wanton spending had started. He spent his last years in a small apartment. He could no longer afford the taxes on &quot;Riverside&quot;, and it was seized by creditors. He had offered to sell the mansion at a huge loss but there were no buyers. At his death ten years later, Schwab&#x27;s holdings in Bethlehem Steel were virtually worthless, and he was over $300,000 in debt. Had he lived a few more years, he would have seen his fortunes restored when Bethlehem Steel was flooded with orders for war material. Schwab had no children by Emma Dinkey, but had one daughter by a mistress.

A bust-length portrait of Schwab painted in 1903 by Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) was formerly in the Jessica Dragonette Collection at the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming at Laramie, but has been donated to the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. Müller-Ury also painted his nephew and namesake Charles M. Schwab, son of his brother Joseph, as a boy in a sailor suit around the same date.

==Death==
Schwab&#x27;s wife died on January 12, 1939. Schwab died nine months later, on September 18 of that year, of heart disease at his apartment on Park Avenue in New York City. His funeral was held at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and about 2,000 people were estimated to line the streets of the procession. Al Smith, John D. Rockefeller Jr., and Charles Evans Hughes were among those in attendance at his funeral. He was originally interred at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York, but his remains were moved on April 29, 1940, to a private mausoleum at Saint Michael Catholic Church Cemetery in Loretto, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="438703" wikidata="Q108235" url="?curid=438703" title="Dormouse">
<text>A dormouse is a rodent of the family Gliridae (this family is also variously called Myoxidae or Muscardinidae by different taxonomists). Dormice are nocturnal animals found in Africa, Asia, and Europe. They are named for their long, dormant hibernation period of six months or longer. There are 9 genera and 28 living species of dormice, with half of living species belonging to the African genus &quot;Graphiurus.&quot;

==Etymology==
The word dormouse comes from Middle English , of uncertain origin, possibly from a dialectal element &quot;*dor-&quot;, from Old Norse and Middle English .

The word is sometimes conjectured to come from an Anglo-Norman derivative of , with the second element mistaken for &quot;mouse&quot;, but no such Anglo-Norman term is known to have existed.

The Latin noun , which is the origin of the scientific name, descends from the Proto-Indo-European noun &quot;*gl̥h₁éys&quot; , and is related to Sanskrit () and Ancient Greek () .

==Characteristics==
Dormice are small rodents, with body lengths between , and weight between . They are generally mouse-like in appearance, but with furred tails. They are largely arboreal, agile, and well adapted to climbing. Most species are nocturnal. Dormice have an excellent sense of hearing and signal each other with a variety of vocalisations.

Dormice are omnivorous, and typically feed on berries, flowers, fruits, insects, and nuts. They are unique among rodents in that they lack a cecum, a part of the gut used in other species to ferment vegetable matter. Their dental formula is similar to that of squirrels, although they often lack premolars:

Dormice breed once (or, occasionally, twice) each year, producing litters with an average of four young after a gestation period of 22–24 days. They can live for as long as five years. The young are born hairless and helpless, and their eyes do not open until about 18 days after birth. They typically become sexually mature after the end of their first hibernation. Dormice live in small family groups, with home ranges that vary widely between species and depend on the availability of food.

===Hibernation===

One of the most notable characteristics of those dormice that live in temperate zones is hibernation. They can hibernate six months out of the year, or even longer if the weather does not become warm enough, sometimes waking for brief periods to eat food they had previously stored nearby. During the summer, they accumulate fat in their bodies to nourish them through the hibernation period.

==Relationship with humans==
The edible dormouse (&quot;Glis glis&quot;) was considered a delicacy in ancient Rome, either as a savoury appetizer or as a dessert (dipped in honey and poppy seeds). The Romans used a special kind of enclosure, a glirarium, to raise and fatten dormice for the table. It is still considered a delicacy in Slovenia and in several places in Croatia, namely Lika, and the islands of Hvar and Brač. Dormouse fat was believed by the Elizabethans to induce sleep since the animal put on fat before hibernating.

In more recent years, dormice have begun to enter the pet trade; however, they are uncommon as pets and are considered an exotic pet. The woodland dormouse (&quot;Graphiurus murinus)&quot; is the most commonly seen species in the pet trade. Asian garden dormice (&quot;Eliomys melanurus&quot;) are also occasionally kept as pets.

==Evolution==
Dormice likely originated in Europe, with the earliest dormouse genus &quot;Eogliravus&quot; being known from the Early Eocene (around 48-41 million years ago) of France. Dormice were relatively undiverse in the Eocene, but considerably diversified during the Oligocene (34-23 million years ago). Their ability to hibernate may have emerged during this period. They reached an apex of diversity during the late Early Miocene (around 17 million years ago) when there were 18 genera and 36 species of dormice in Europe alone during this period. During this timespan, dormice represented the dominant group of rodents in Europe. The earliest Asian dormice are known from the early Miocene, and the Miocene saw the emergence of several of the modern genera of living dormice. The diversity of dormice saw continual decline until the middle Pliocene, when there was again a period of speciation, mostly driven by the diversification of the African &quot;Graphiurus&quot;, which first appeared during the Pliocene, while the diversity of European dormice remained relatively low compared to their Miocene peak. Several dormouse lineaged experienced insular gigantism after being isolated on islands in the Mediterranean during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, the largest being the rabbit sized &quot;Leithia&quot; of Sicily and Malta, the largest dormouse ever.

==Classification==
The family consists of 29 extant species, in three subfamilies and (arguably) nine genera:

<text>The lesser whistling duck (Dendrocygna javanica), also known as Indian whistling duck or lesser whistling teal, is a species of whistling duck that breeds in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. They are nocturnal feeders that during the day may be found in flocks around lakes and wet paddy fields. They can perch on trees and sometimes build their nest in the hollow of a tree. This brown and long-necked duck has broad wings that are visible in flight and produces a loud two-note wheezy call. It has a chestnut rump, differentiating it from its larger relative, the fulvous whistling duck, which has a creamy white rump.

==Description==

This chestnut brown duck is confusable only with the fulvous whistling duck (&quot;D. bicolor&quot;) but has chestnut upper-tail coverts unlike the creamy white in the latter. The ring around the eye is orange to yellow. When flying straight, their head is held below the level of the body as in other &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; species. The crown appears dark and the sexes are alike in plumage. They fly slowly but with rapid wing-flapping and usually produce a repetitive wheezy &quot;seasick&quot; call as they circle overhead. They are very nocturnal and often rest during the day. The outermost primary feather has the inner vane modified. They produce very prominent whistling sound while flying.

==Distribution and habitat==

This is a largely resident species distributed widely across lowland wetlands of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The species also occur on islands in the region including the Andamans, Nicobars and Maldives. They sometimes make local movements in response to weather and changes in water availability and the more northern birds winter further south. They are found in freshwater wetlands with good vegetation cover and often rest during the day on the banks or even on the open sea in coastal areas. Downy chicks are black with a white eyebrow and white patches on the back of the head, the wing, lower back and rump. Albino individuals have been seen in the wild.
Large numbers are sometimes found in urban wetlands such as in Kolkata and Goa, particularly during winter. In the Alipore Zoological Gardens, captive individuals were introduced in the 1930s and wild birds joined this nucleus subsequently.

With a wide distribution range between 1 and 10 million km², they are considered to have a secure global population of between two and twenty million individuals. They are not threatened by hunting as they are not considered good to eat. Hunters in Assam however have been known to raise the ducklings to serve as live decoy.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Lesser whistling duck are usually gregarious. They feed mainly on plants taken from the water as well as grains from cultivated rice apart from small fish, frogs and invertebrates such as molluscs and worms. They dabble as well as dive in water. They will often waddle on the land and Common mynas have been noted to follow them on grass. Courtship involves the male facing the female and dipping and raising its bill in the water and swimming around the female. They breed during the monsoon or rainy season and may vary locally in relation to the food availability. The nest site may be a tree hole lined with twigs and grass or built in the fork of a large tree, sometimes reusing an old nest of a kite or heron or even on the ground. The clutch varies from 7 to 12 white eggs that are incubated by both the parents. Large clutches of up to 17 have been noted although these may be indications of intraspecific brood parasitism. The eggs hatch after about 22–24 days. More than one brood may be raised in a single season. Young birds may sometimes be carried on the back of the parents.

Local names like &quot;sili&quot; and &quot;silhahi&quot; in India are based on their wheezy two-note calls. They become very tame in captivity, walking about and responding to whistles. Individuals in captivity in the USA have lived for up to 9 years.

Several endoparasitic cestodes including &quot;Hymenolepis javanensis&quot; and &quot;Cittotaenia sandgroundi&quot; have been described from lesser whistling duck hosts apart from ectoparasitic bird lice and mites.

== Transport ==

Many of the Zhoushan Islands are now linked by bridges. This means that Putuoshan can easily be reached by bus from Shanghai and Ningbo. The bus terminates at Shenjiamen Bus Station. From the Banshengdong Wharf on the Shenjiamen waterfront it is a 10-minute ride by fast ferry (22 RMB) to Putuoshan. In Shanghai, the Nanpu Bridge Bus Station, Shanghai Stadium Sightseeing Bus Center and Shanghai South Long Distance Bus Station have several departures daily to Shenjiamen (4–5 hours, 138 RMB). In Ningbo, the North and South bus stations both have regular daily departures to Shenjiamen (2–3 hours, 60 RMB).

There are two flights daily from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport to Putuo Airport, which is only from Shenjiamen. (approx 800 RMB).

The ferry services mentioned below are still available but the bus services now provide a greater level of convenience and comfort. Putuoshan can be reached by boat from the major cities of Ningbo and Shanghai. It will take approximately an hour by boat to reach the wharf at Ningbo, from where a bus transports passengers to Ningbo city centre. There are two boats linking Putuoshan and Shanghai. One departs in the evening and travels overnight, arriving in the early morning; the other leaves early in the day from a wharf outside of Shanghai city centre but takes less than two hours.

The transportation system of Mountain Putuo is very special. Private cars are not allowed there, and people can only rely on public transport. The reason for this rule is because the area of Putuo Mountain is very small, and only one road runs through the entire island. It is therefore necessary to control the number of cars on the island to avoid traffic congestion. At the same time, excessive vehicle emissions will affect the environment and air quality of Mountain Putuo. In addition, Putuo Mount is mountainous, so buses are not flexible enough for people to travel. And as there are thousands of tourists coming to Mountain Putuo and the number of buses is far from enough, the cable car has become another important means of transportation.
