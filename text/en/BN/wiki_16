<text>Early childhood education (ECE), also known as nursery education, is a branch of education theory that relates to the teaching of children (formally and informally) from birth up to the age of eight. Traditionally, this is up to the equivalent of third grade. ECE is described as an important period in child development.

ECE emerged as a field of study during the Enlightenment, particularly in European countries with high literacy rates. It continued to grow through the nineteenth century as universal primary education became a norm in the Western world. In recent years, early childhood education has become a prevalent public policy issue, as funding for preschool and pre-K is debated by municipal, state, and federal lawmakers. Governing entities are also debating the central focus of early childhood education with debate on developmental appropriate play versus strong academic preparation curriculum in reading, writing, and math. The global priority placed on early childhood education is underscored with targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4. , however, &quot;only around 4 in 10 children aged 3 and 4 attend early childhood education&quot; around the world. Furthermore, levels of participation vary widely by region with, &quot;around 2 in 3 children in Latin American and the Caribbean attending ECE compared to just under half of children in South Asia and only 1 in 4 in sub-Saharan Africa&quot;.

ECE is also a professional designation earned through a post-secondary education program. For example, in Ontario, Canada, the designations ECE (Early Childhood Educator) and RECE (Registered Early Childhood Educator) may only be used by registered members of the College of Early Childhood Educators, which is made up of accredited child care professionals who are held accountable to the College&#x27;s standards of practice.

Research shows that early-childhood education has substantial positive short- and long-term effects on the children who attend such education, and that the costs are dwarfed by societal gains of the education programs.

== Theories of child development ==
The Developmental Interaction Approach is based on the theories of Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson, John Dewey, and Lucy Sprague Mitchell. The approach focuses on learning through discovery.
Jean Jacques Rousseau recommended that teachers should exploit individual children&#x27;s interests to make sure each child obtains the information most essential to his personal and individual development. The five developmental domains of childhood development include:
* Physical: the way in which a child develops biological and physical functions, including eyesight and motor skills
* Social: the way in which a child interacts with others Children develop an understanding of their responsibilities and rights as members of families and communities, as well as an ability to relate to and work with others.
* Emotional: the way in which a child creates emotional connections and develops self-confidence. Emotional connections develop when children relate to other people and share feelings.
*Language: the way in which a child communicates, including how they present their feelings and emotions, both to other people and to themselves. At 3 months, children employ different cries for different needs. At 6 months they can recognize and imitate the basic sounds of spoken language. In the first 3 years, children need to be exposed to communication with others in order to pick up language. &quot;Normal&quot; language development is measured by the rate of vocabulary acquisition. 
* Cognitive skills: the way in which a child organizes information. Cognitive skills include problem solving, creativity, imagination and memory. They embody the way in which children make sense of the world. Piaget believed that children exhibit prominent differences in their thought patterns as they move through the stages of cognitive development: sensorimotor period, the pre-operational period, and the operational period.

To meet those developmental domains, a child has a set of needs that must be met for learning. Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs showcases the different levels of needs that must be met the chart to the right showcases these needs.

=== Froebel&#x27;s play theory ===
Friedrich Froebel was a German Educator that believed in the idea of children learning through play. Specifically, he said, &quot;play is the highest expression of human development in childhood, for it alone is the free expression of what is in the child&#x27;s soul.&quot; Froebel believed that teachers should act as a facilitators and supporters for the students&#x27;s play, rather than an authoritative, disciplinary figure. He created educational open-ended toys that he called &quot;gifts&quot; and &quot;occupations&quot; that were designed to encourage self expression and initiation.

=== Maria Montessori&#x27;s theory ===
Maria Montessori was an Italian physician that, based on her observations of young children in classrooms, developed a method of education that focused on independence. In Montessori education, a typical classroom is made up of students of different ages and curriculum is based on the students&#x27; developmental stage, which Montessori called the four planes of development.

Montessori&#x27;s Four Planes of Development:

* The first plane (birth to age 6): During this stage, children soak up information about the world around them quickly, which is why Montessori refers to it as the &quot;absorbent mind&quot;. Physical independence, such as completing tasks independently, is a main focus of the child at this time and children&#x27;s individual personalities begin to form and develop.
* The second plane (Ages 6–12): During this stage, children also focus on independence, but intellectual rather than physical. Montessori classrooms use what is called &quot;cosmic education&quot; during this stage, which emphasizes children building on their understanding of the world, their place in it, and how everything is interdependent. Children in this plane also begin to develop abstract and moral thinking.
* The third plane (Ages 12–18): During this stage, adolescents shift to focus on emotional independence and on the self. Moral values, critical thinking, and self-identity are explored and strengthened.
* The fourth plane (Ages 18–24): During this last stage, focus shifts to financial independence. Young adults in this plane begin to solidify their personal beliefs, identity, and role in the world.

=== Vygotsky&#x27;s socio-cultural learning theory ===

Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky proposed a &quot;socio-cultural learning theory&quot; that emphasized the impact of social and cultural experiences on individual thinking and the development of mental processes. Vygotsky&#x27;s theory emerged in the 1930s and is still discussed today as a means of improving and reforming educational practices.
In Vygotsky&#x27;s theories of learning, he also postulated the theory of the zone of proximal development. This theory ties in with children building off prior knowledge and gaining new knowledge related to skills they already have. This theory further describes how new knowledge or skills are taken in if they are not fully learned but are starting to emerge. A teacher or older friend lends support to a child learning a skill, be it building a block castle, tying a shoe, or writing one&#x27;s name. As the child becomes more capable of the steps of the activity, the adult or older child withdraws supports gradually, until the child is competent completing the process on his/her own. This is done within that activity&#x27;s zone—the distance between where the child is, and where he potentially will be. In each zone of proximal development, they build on skills and grow by learning more skills in their proximal development range. They build on the skills by being guided by teachers and parents. They must build from where they are in their zone of proximal development.
Vygotsky argued that since cognition occurs within a social context, our social experiences shape our ways of thinking about and interpreting the world. People such as parents, grandparents, and teachers play the roles of what Vygotsky described as knowledgeable and competent adults. Although Vygotsky predated social constructivists, he is commonly classified as one. Social constructivists believe that an individual&#x27;s cognitive system is a resditional learning time. Vygotsky advocated that teachers facilitate rather than direct student learning. Teachers should provide a learning environment where students can explore and develop their learning without direct instruction. His approach calls for teachers to incorporate students&#x27; needs and interests. It is important to do this because students&#x27; levels of interest and abilities will vary and there needs to be differentiation.

However, teachers can enhance understandings and learning for students. Vygotsky states that by sharing meanings that are relevant to the children&#x27;s environment, adults promote cognitive development as well. Their teachings can influence thought processes and perspectives of students when they are in new and similar environments. Since Vygotsky promotes more facilitation in children&#x27;s learning, he suggests that knowledgeable people (and adults in particular), can also enhance knowledges through cooperative meaning-making with students in their learning, this can be done through the zone of proximal development by guiding children&#x27;s learning or thinking skills . Vygotsky&#x27;s approach encourages guided participation and student exploration with support. Teachers can help students achieve their cognitive development levels through consistent and regular interactions of collaborative knowledge-making learning processes.

=== Piaget&#x27;s constructivist theory ===

Jean Piaget&#x27;s constructivist theory gained influence in the 1970s and &#x27;80s. Although Piaget himself was primarily interested in a descriptive psychology of cognitive development, he also laid the groundwork for a constructivist theory of learning. Piaget believed that learning comes from within: children construct their own knowledge of the world through experience and subsequent reflection. He said that &quot;if logic itself is created rather than being inborn, it follows that the first task of education is to form reasoning.&quot; Within Piaget&#x27;s framework, teachers should guide children in acquiring their own knowledge rather than simply transferring knowledge.

According to Piaget&#x27;s theory, when young children encounter new information, they attempt to accommodate and assimilate it into their existing understanding of the world. Accommodation involves adapting mental schemas and representations to make them consistent with reality. Assimilation involves fitting new information into their pre-existing schemas. Through these two processes, young children learn by equilibrating their mental representations with reality. They also learn from mistakes.

A Piagetian approach emphasizes experiential education; in school, experiences become more hands-on and concrete as students explore through trial and error. Thus, crucial components of early childhood education include exploration, manipulating objects, and experiencing new environments. Subsequent reflection on these experiences is equally important.

Piaget&#x27;s concept of reflective abstraction was particularly influential in mathematical education. Through reflective abstraction, children construct more advanced cognitive structures out of the simpler ones they already possess. This allows children to develop mathematical constructs that cannot be learned through equilibration – making sense of experiences through assimilation and accommodation – alone.

According to Piagetian theory, language and symbolic representation is preceded by the development of corresponding mental representations. Research shows that the level of reflective abstraction achieved by young children was found to limit the degree to which they could represent physical quantities with written numerals. Piaget held that children can invent their own procedures for the four arithmetical operations, without being taught any conventional rules.

Piaget&#x27;s theory implies that computers can be a great educational tool for young children when used to support the design and construction of their projects. McCarrick and Xiaoming found that computer play is consistent with this theory. However, Plowman and Stephen found that the effectiveness of computers is limited in the preschool environment; their results indicate that computers are only effective when directed by the teacher. This suggests, according to the constructivist theory, that the role of preschool teachers is critical in successfully adopting computers as they existed in 2003.

===Kolb&#x27;s experiential learning theory===

David Kolb&#x27;s experiential learning theory, which was influenced by John Dewey, Kurt Lewin and Jean Piaget, argues that children need to experience things to learn: &quot;The process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience. Knowledge results from the combinations of grasping and transforming experience.&quot; The experimental learning theory is distinctive in that children are seen and taught as individuals. As a child explores and observes, teachers ask the child probing questions. The child can then adapt prior knowledge to learning new information.

Kolb breaks down this learning cycle into four stages: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. Children observe new situations, think about the situation, make meaning of the situation, then test that meaning in the world around them.
=== Bronfenbrenner&#x27;s ecological systems theory ===
Similar to Kolb&#x27;s experiential learning theory, which emphasizes a child&#x27;s relationship with the world around them, Urie Bronfenbrenner&#x27;s Ecological Systems Theory considers the ways in which systems at various levels impact an individual&#x27;s development. The five levels, in his view, are:

* The individual: these influences (genetics, age, etc.) take place within the individual to influence their development. 
* The microsystem: a specific setting that impacts the individual in a habitual way (family, classrooms, peers, etc.).
* The mesosystem: this describes how microsystems relate to one another. For example, school demands so much time and attention it reduces the influence available by one&#x27;s peer group.
* The exosystem: this system comprises settings which do not involve an individual but still exert an impact on their development. A child&#x27;s parent getting a new supervisor at work that does a poor job and increases this parent&#x27;s life stress would occur in the exosystem, as the child may never enter this location, but still be significantly affected by the changes to their parent&#x27;s mood, behavior, and/or availability. 
* The Macrosystem: this level captures the values and structures that shape all the systems and relationships in previous levels. This describes not only governmental policies, but also the broader attitudes that a society uses to judge what is deemed desirable or acceptable.

One of the chief reasons Bronfenbrenner conceptualizes development in this way is not merely to highlight the role of one&#x27;s context, but to illustrate the multiple determinants of one&#x27;s developmental trajectory while also capturing their individual agency. This approach blends disciplines of biology, psychology, sociology, and anthropology to more fully capture the complexity of development. One of the main contributions that Bronfenbrenner&#x27;s work had on the American childcare system was through his co-founding of the federal Head Start program.

==Practical implications of early childhood education==
In recent decades, studies have shown that early childhood education is critical in preparing children to enter and succeed in the (grade school) classroom, diminishing their risk of social-emotional mental health problems and increasing their self-sufficiency later in their lives. In other words, the child needs to be taught to rationalize everything and to be open to interpretations and critical thinking. There is no subject to be considered taboo, starting with the most basic knowledge of the world that they live in, and ending with deeper areas, such as morality, religion and science. Visual stimulus and response time as early as 3 months can be an indicator of verbal and performance IQ at age 4 years. When parents value ECE and its importance their children generally have a higher rate of attendance. This allows children the opportunity to build and nurture trusting relationships with educators and social relationships with peers.

By providing education in a child&#x27;s most formative years, ECE also has the capacity to pre-emptively begin closing the educational achievement gap between low and high-income students before formal schooling begins. Children of low socioeconomic status (SES) often begin school already behind their higher SES peers; on average, by the time they are three, children with high SES have three times the number of words in their vocabularies as children with low SES. Participation in ECE, however, has been proven to increase high school graduation rates, improve performance on standardized tests, and reduce both grade repetition and the number of children placed in special education.

A study was conducted by the Aga Khan Development Network&#x27;s Madrasa Early Childhood Programme on the impact that early childhood education had on students&#x27; performance in grade school. Looking specifically at students who attended the Madrasa Early Childhood schools (virtually all of whom came from economically disadvantaged backgrounds), the study found that they had consistently ranked in the top 20% in grade 1 classes. The study also concluded that any formal early childhood education contributed to higher levels of cognitive development in language, mathematics, and non-verbal reasoning skills.

Especially since the first wave of results from the Perry Preschool Project were published, there has been widespread consensus that the quality of early childhood education programs correlate with gains in low-income children&#x27;s IQs and test scores, decreased grade retention, and lower special education rates.

Several studies have reported that children enrolled in ECE increase their IQ scores by 4–11 points by age five, while a Milwaukee study reported a 25-point gain. In addition, students who had been enrolled in the Abecedarian Project, an often-cited ECE study, scored significantly higher on reading and math tests by age fifteen than comparable students who had not participated in early childhood programs. In addition, 36% of students in the Abecedarian Preschool Study treatment group would later enroll in four-year colleges compared to 14% of those in the control group.

In 2017, researchers reported that children who participate in ECE graduate high school at significantly greater rates than those who do not. Additionally, those who participate in ECE require special education and must repeat a grade at significantly lower rates than their peers who did not receive ECE. The NIH asserts that ECE leads to higher test scores for students from preschool through age 21, improved grades in math and reading, and stronger odds that students will keep going to school and attend college.

Nathaniel Hendren and Ben Sprung-Keyser, two Harvard economists, found high Marginal Values of Public Funds (MVPFs) for investments in programs supporting the health and early education of children, particularly those that reach children from low-income families. The average MVPF for these types of initiatives is over 5, while the MVPFs for programs for adults generally range from 0.5 to 2.

Beyond benefitting societal good, ECE also significantly impacts the socioeconomic outcomes of individuals. For example, by age 26, students who had been enrolled in Chicago Child-Parent Centers were less likely to be arrested, abuse drugs, and receive food stamps; they were more likely to have high school diplomas, health insurance and full-time employment. Studies also show that ECE heightens social engagement, bolsters lifelong health, reduces the incidence of teen pregnancy, supports mental health, decreases the risk of heart disease, and lengthens lifespans.

The World Bank&#x27;s 2019 World Development Report on &quot;The Changing Nature of Work&quot; identifies early childhood development programs as one of the most effective ways governments can equip children with the skills they will need to succeed in future labor markets.

According to a 2020 study in the Journal of Political Economy by Clemson University economist Jorge Luis García, Nobel laureate James J. Heckman and University of Southern California economists Duncan Ermini Leaf and María José Prados, every dollar spent on a high-quality early-childhood programs led to a return of $7.3 over the long-term.

===The Perry Preschool Project===

The Perry Preschool Project, which was conducted in the 1960s in Ypsilanti, Michigan, is the oldest social experiment in the field of early childhood education and has heavily influenced policy in the United States and across the globe. The experiment enrolled 128 three- and four-year-old African-American children with cognitive disadvantage from low-income families, who were then randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The intervention for children in the treatment group included active learning preschool sessions on weekdays for 2.5 hours per day. The intervention also included weekly visits by the teachers to the homes of the children for about 1.5 hours per visit to improve parent-child interactions at home.

Initial evaluations of the Perry intervention showed that the preschool program failed to significantly boost an IQ measure. However, later evaluations that followed up the participants for more than fifty years have demonstrated the long-term economic benefits of the program, even after accounting for the small sample size of the experiment, flaws in its randomization procedure, and sample attrition. There is some evidence on reduction of criminal convictions of male participants, especially for violent crime, and their earnings in middle adulthood. Research points to improvements in non-cognitive skills, executive functioning, childhood home environment, and parental attachment as potential sources of the observed long-term impacts of the program. The intervention&#x27;s many benefits also include improvements in late-midlife health for both male and female participants. Perry promoted educational attainment through two avenues: total years of education attained and rates of progression to a given level of education. Treated females received less special education, progressed more quickly through grades, earned higher GPAs, and attained higher levels of education than their control group counterparts.

Research also demonstrates spillover effects of the Perry program on the children and siblings of the original participants. A study concludes, &quot;The children of treated participants have fewer school suspensions, higher levels of education and employment, and lower levels of participation in crime, compared with the children of untreated participants. Impacts are especially pronounced for the children of male participants. These treatment effects are associated with improved childhood home environments.&quot; The study also documents beneficial impacts on the male siblings of the original participants. The Perry Preschool Project advocates for public spending on early childhood programs as an economic investment in a society&#x27;s future, rather than in the interest of social justice.

==International agreements==
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (1976), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) have all addressed childhood education. Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that &quot;States Parties recognized the right of the child to education, and with a view to achieving this right progression and on the basis of equal opportunity, they shall, in particular:

# Make primary education compulsory and available free to all;
# Encourage the development of different forms of secondary education, including general and vocational education, and take appropriate measures such as the introduction of free education and offering financial assistance in case of need;
# Make higher education accessible to all on the basis of capacity by every appropriate means;
# Make educational and vocational information and guidance available and accessible to all children;
# Take measures to encourage regular attendance at schools and the reduction of drop-out rates.&quot;

The first World Conference on Early Childhood Care and Education took place in Moscow from 27 to 29 September 2010, jointly organized by UNESCO and the city of Moscow. The overarching goals of the conference are to:
Under Goal 4 of the Sustainable Development Goals, which the UN General Assembly unanimously approved in 2015, countries committed to &quot;ensure inclusive and equitable quality education&#x27; including early childhood.&quot; Two targets related to goal 4 are &quot;by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education.&quot; The &#x27;Framework for Action&#x27; adopted by UNESCO member states later in 2015 outlines how to translate this last target into practice, and encourages states to provide &quot;at least one year of free and compulsory pre-primary education of good quality.&quot; The Sustainable Development Goals, however, are not binding international law.

It has been argued that &quot;International law provides no effective protection of the right to pre-primary education.&quot; Just two global treaties explicitly reference education prior to primary school. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women requires states to ensure equality for girls &quot;in pre-school.&quot; And in the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, states agree that access to &quot;public pre-school educational institutions&quot; shall not be denied due to the parents&#x27; or child&#x27;s &quot;irregular situation with respect to stay.&quot;

Less explicitly, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires that &quot;States Parties shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels.&quot;

In June 2024, the UN&#x27;s Human Rights Council approved the establishment of a working group with the mandate of &quot;exploring the possibility of, elaborating and submitting to the Human Rights Council a draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child with the aim to: (a) Explicitly recognize that the right to education includes early childhood care and education; (b) Explicitly state that, with a view to achieving the right to education, States shall: (i) Make public pre-primary education available free to all, beginning with at least one year.&quot;

According to UNESCO, a preschool curriculum is one that delivers educational content through daily activities and furthers a child&#x27;s physical, cognitive, and social development. Generally, preschool curricula are only recognized by governments if they are based on academic research and reviewed by peers.

Preschool for Child Rights have pioneered into preschool curricular areas and is contributing into child rights through their preschool curriculum.
== Curricula in early childhood care and education ==
Curricula in early childhood care and education (ECCE) is the driving force behind any ECCE programme. It is &#x27;an integral part of the engine that, together with the energy and motivation of staff, provides the momentum that makes programmes live&#x27;. It follows therefore that the quality of a programme is greatly influenced by the quality of its curriculum. In early childhood, these may be programs for children or parents, including health and nutrition interventions and prenatal programs, as well as center-based programs for children.

== Barriers and challenges ==
Children&#x27;s learning potential and outcomes are negatively affected by exposure to violence, abuse and child labour. Thus, protecting young children from violence and exploitation is part of broad educational concerns. Due to difficulties and sensitivities around the issue of measuring and monitoring child protection violations and gaps in defining, collecting and analysing appropriate indicators, data coverage in this area is scant. However, proxy indicators can be used to assess the situation. For example, ratification of relevant international conventions indicates countries&#x27; commitment to child protection. By April 2014, 194 countries had ratified the CRC3; and 179 had ratified the 1999 International Labour Organization&#x27;s Convention (No. 182) concerning the elimination of the worst forms of child labour. However, many of these ratifications are yet to be given full effect through actual implementation of concrete measures. Globally, 150 million children aged 5–14 are estimated to be engaged in child labour. In conflict-affected poor countries, children are twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday compared to those in other poor countries. In industrialized countries, a study by UNESCO shows, 4 per cent of children are physically abused each year and 10 per cent are neglected or psychologically abused.

In both developed and developing countries, children of the poor and the disadvantaged remain the least served, despite that the added value of early childhood care and education services are higher for them than for their more affluent counterparts, even when such services are of modest quality. While the problem is more intractable in developing countries, the developed world still does not equitably provide quality early childhood care and education services for all its children. In many European countries, children, mostly from low-income and immigrant families, do not have access to good quality early childhood care and education.

The effect of early childhood programs tends to decrease from proof of concept trials to larger-scale programs.

=== Orphan education ===
A lack of education during the early childhood years for orphans is a worldwide concern. Orphans are at higher risk of &quot;missing out on schooling, living in households with less food security, and suffering from anxiety and depression.&quot; Education during these years has the potential to improve a child&#x27;s &quot;food and nutrition, health care, social welfare, and protection.&quot; This crisis is especially prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa which has been heavily impacted by the aids epidemic. UNICEF reports that &quot;13.3 million children (0–17 years) worldwide have lost one or both parents to AIDS. Nearly 12 million of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa.&quot; Government policies such as the Free Basic Education Policy have worked to provide education for orphan children in this area, but the quality and inclusiveness of this policy has brought criticism.

<text>Preterm birth, also known as premature birth, is the birth of a baby at fewer than 37 weeks gestational age, as opposed to full-term delivery at approximately 40 weeks. Extreme preterm is less than 28 weeks, very early preterm birth is between 28 and 32 weeks, early preterm birth occurs between 32 and 34 weeks, late preterm birth is between 34 and 36 weeks&#x27; gestation. These babies are also known as premature babies or colloquially preemies (American English) or premmies (Australian English). Symptoms of preterm labor include uterine contractions which occur more often than every ten minutes and/or the leaking of fluid from the vagina before 37 weeks. Premature infants are at greater risk for cerebral palsy, delays in development, hearing problems and problems with their vision. The earlier a baby is born, the greater these risks will be.

The cause of spontaneous preterm birth is often not known. Risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, multiple gestation (being pregnant with more than one baby), being either obese or underweight, vaginal infections, air pollution exposure, tobacco smoking, and psychological stress. For a healthy pregnancy, medical induction of labor or cesarean section are not recommended before 39 weeks unless required for other medical reasons. There may be certain medical reasons for early delivery such as preeclampsia.
Preterm birth may be prevented in those at risk if the hormone progesterone is taken during pregnancy. Evidence does not support the usefulness of bed rest. It is estimated that at least 75% of preterm infants would survive with appropriate treatment, and the survival rate is highest among the infants born the latest in gestation. In women who might deliver between 24 and 37 weeks, corticosteroid treatment may improve outcomes. A number of medications, including nifedipine, may delay delivery so that a mother can be moved to where more medical care is available and the corticosteroids have a greater chance to work. Once the baby is born, care includes keeping the baby warm through skin-to-skin contact or incubation, supporting breastfeeding and/or formula feeding, treating infections, and supporting breathing. Preterm babies sometimes require intubation.
Preterm birth is the most common cause of death among infants worldwide. About 15 million babies are preterm each year (5% to 18% of all deliveries). Late preterm birth accounts for 75% of all preterm births. This rate is inconsistent across countries. In the United Kingdom 7.9% of babies are born pre-term and in the United States 12.3% of all births are before 37 weeks gestation. Approximately 0.5% of births are extremely early periviable births (20–25 weeks of gestation), and these account for most of the deaths. In many countries, rates of premature births have increased between the 1990s and 2010s. Complications from preterm births resulted globally in 0.81 million deaths in 2015, down from 1.57 million in 1990. The chance of survival at 22 weeks is about 6%, while at 23 weeks it is 26%, 24 weeks 55% and 25 weeks about 72%. The chances of survival without any long-term difficulties are lower.
== Signs and symptoms ==

Signs and symptoms of preterm labor include four or more uterine contractions in one hour. In contrast to false labour, true labor is accompanied by cervical dilation and effacement. Also, vaginal bleeding in the third trimester, heavy pressure in the pelvis, or abdominal or back pain could be indicators that a preterm birth is about to occur. A watery discharge from the vagina may indicate premature rupture of the membranes that surround the baby. While the rupture of the membranes may not be followed by labor, usually delivery is indicated as infection (chorioamnionitis) is a serious threat to both fetus and mother. In some cases, the cervix dilates prematurely without pain or perceived contractions, so that the mother may not have warning signs until very late in the birthing process.

== Causes ==
The main categories of causes of preterm birth are preterm labor induction and spontaneous preterm labor.

=== Risk factors ===
The exact cause of spontaneous preterm birth is difficult to determine and it may be caused by many different factors at the same time as labor is a complex process. The research available is limited with regard to the cervix and therefore is limited in discerning what is or is not normal. Four different pathways have been identified that can result in preterm birth and have considerable evidence: precocious fetal endocrine activation, uterine overdistension (placental abruption), decidual bleeding, and intrauterine inflammation or infection.

Identifying women at high risk of giving birth early would enable the health services to provide specialized care for these women and their babies, for example a hospital with a special care baby unit such as a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). In some instances, it may be possible to delay the birth. Risk scoring systems have been suggested as an approach to identify those at higher risk, however, there is no strong research in this area so it is unclear whether the use of risk scoring systems for identifying mothers would prolong pregnancy and reduce the numbers of preterm births or not.

====Maternal factors====
Risk factors in the mother have been identified that are linked to a higher risk of a preterm birth. These include age (either very young or older), high or low body mass index (BMI), length of time between pregnancies, endometriosis, previous spontaneous (i.e., miscarriage) or surgical abortions, unintended pregnancies, untreated or undiagnosed celiac disease, fertility difficulties, heat exposure, and genetic variables.

Studies on type of work and physical activity have given conflicting results, but it is opined that stressful conditions, hard labor, and long hours are probably linked to preterm birth. Obesity does not directly lead to preterm birth; however, it is associated with diabetes and hypertension which are risk factors by themselves. To some degree those individuals may have underlying conditions (i.e., uterine malformation, hypertension, diabetes) that persist. Couples who have tried more than one year versus those who have tried less than one year before achieving a spontaneous conception have an adjusted odds ratio of 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.22–1.50) of preterm birth. Pregnancies after IVF confers a greater risk of preterm birth than spontaneous conceptions after more than one year of trying, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.55 (95% CI 1.30–1.85).

Certain ethnicities may have a higher risk as well. For example, in the U.S. and the UK, Black women have preterm birth rates of 15–18%, more than double than that of the white population. Many Black women have higher preterm birth rates due to multiple factors but the most common is high amounts of chronic stress, which can eventually lead to premature birth. Adult chronic disease is not always the case with premature birth in Black women, which makes the main factor of premature birth challenging to identify. Filipinos are also at high risk of premature birth, and it is believed that nearly 11–15% of Filipinos born in the U.S. (compared to other Asians at 7.6% and whites at 7.8%) are premature. Filipinos being a big risk factor is evidenced with the Philippines being the eighth-highest ranking in the world for preterm births, the only non-African country in the top 10. This discrepancy is not seen in comparison to other Asian groups or Hispanic immigrants and remains unexplained. Genetic make-up is a factor in the causality of preterm birth. Genetics has been a big factor into why Filipinos have a high risk of premature birth as the Filipinos have a large prevalence of mutations that help them be predisposed to premature births. An intra- and transgenerational increase in the risk of preterm delivery has been demonstrated. No single gene has been identified.

Marital status has long been associated with risks for preterm birth. A 2005 study of 25,373 pregnancies in Finland revealed that unmarried mothers had more preterm deliveries than married mothers (P=0.001). Pregnancy outside of marriage was associated overall with a 20% increase in total adverse outcomes, even at a time when Finland provided free maternity care. A study in Quebec of 720,586 births from 1990 to 1997 revealed less risk of preterm birth for infants with legally married mothers compared with those with common-law wed or unwed parents. A study conducted in Malaysia in 2015 showed a similar trend, with marital status being significantly associated with preterm birth. However, the result of a study conducted in the US showed that between 1989 and 2006, marriage became less protective of preterm births which was attributed to the changing social norms and behaviors surrounding marriage.

====Factors during pregnancy====
Medications during pregnancy, living conditions, air pollution, smoking, illicit drugs or alcohol, infection, or physical trauma may also cause a preterm birth.

Air pollution: Living in an area with a high concentration of air pollution is a major risk factor for preterm labor, including living near major roadways or highways where vehicle emissions are high from traffic congestion or are a route for diesel trucks that tend to emit more pollution.

The use of fertility medication that stimulates the ovary to release multiple eggs and of IVF with embryo transfer of multiple embryos has been implicated as a risk factor for preterm birth. Often labor has to be induced for medical reasons; such conditions include high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, maternal diabetes, asthma, thyroid disease, and heart disease.

Certain medical conditions in the pregnant mother may also increase the risk of preterm birth. Some women have anatomical problems that prevent the baby from being carried to term. These include a weak or short cervix (the strongest predictor of premature birth). Women with vaginal bleeding during pregnancy are at higher risk for preterm birth. While bleeding in the third trimester may be a sign of placenta previa or placental abruption—conditions that occur frequently preterm—even earlier bleeding that is not caused by these conditions is linked to a higher preterm birth rate. Women with abnormal amounts of amniotic fluid, whether too much (polyhydramnios) or too little (oligohydramnios), are also at risk. Anxiety and depression have been linked as risk factors for preterm birth.

The use of tobacco, cocaine, and excessive alcohol during pregnancy increases the chance of preterm delivery. Tobacco is the most commonly used drug during pregnancy and contributes significantly to low birth weight delivery. Babies with birth defects are at higher risk of being born preterm.

Passive smoking and/or smoking before the pregnancy influences the probability of a preterm birth. The World Health Organization published an international study in March 2014.

Presence of anti-thyroid antibodies is associated with an increased risk preterm birth with an odds ratio of 1.9 and 95% confidence interval of 1.1–3.5.

Intimate violence against the mother is another risk factor for preterm birth.

Physical trauma may case a preterm birth. The Nigerian cultural method of abdominal massage has been shown to result in 19% preterm birth among women in Nigeria, plus many other adverse outcomes for the mother and baby. This ought not be confused with massage therapy conducted by a fully trained and certified/licensed massage therapist or by significant others trained to provide massage during pregnancy, which—in a study involving pregnant females with prenatal depression—has been shown to have numerous positive results during pregnancy, including the reduction of preterm birth, less depression, lower cortisol, and reduced anxiety. In healthy women, however, no effects have been demonstrated in a controlled study.

====Infection====
The frequency of infection in preterm birth is inversely related to the gestational age. &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; infection is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, and spontaneous abortion.

Infectious microorganisms can be ascending, hematogenous, iatrogenic by a procedure, or retrograde through the fallopian tubes. From the deciduae they may reach the space between the amnion and chorion, the amniotic fluid, and the fetus. A chorioamnionitis also may lead to sepsis of the mother. Fetal infection is linked to preterm birth and to significant long-term disability including cerebral palsy.

It has been reported that asymptomatic colonization of the decidua occurs in up to 70% of women at term using a DNA probe suggesting that the presence of micro-organism alone may be insufficient to initiate the infectious response.

As the condition is more prevalent in black women in the U.S. and the UK, it has been suggested to be an explanation for the higher rate of preterm birth in these populations. It is opined that bacterial vaginosis before or during pregnancy may affect the decidual inflammatory response that leads to preterm birth. The condition known as aerobic vaginitis can be a serious risk factor for preterm labor; several previous studies failed to acknowledge the difference between aerobic vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis, which may explain some of the contradiction in the results.

Untreated yeast infections are associated with preterm birth.

A review into prophylactic antibiotics (given to prevent infection) in the second and third trimester of pregnancy (13–42 weeks of pregnancy) found a reduction in the number of preterm births in women with bacterial vaginosis. These antibiotics also reduced the number of waters breaking before labor in full-term pregnancies, reduced the risk of infection of the lining of the womb after delivery (endometritis), and rates of gonococcal infection. However, the women without bacterial vaginosis did not have any reduction in preterm births or pre-labor preterm waters breaking. Much of the research included in this review lost participants during follow-up so did not report the long-term effects of the antibiotics on mothers or babies. More research in this area is needed to find the full effects of giving antibiotics throughout the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

A number of maternal bacterial infections are associated with preterm birth including pyelonephritis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, pneumonia, and appendicitis. A review into giving antibiotics in pregnancy for asymptomatic bacteriuria (urine infection with no symptoms) found the research was of very low quality but that it did suggest that taking antibiotics reduced the numbers of preterm births and babies with low birth weight. Another review found that one dose of antibiotics did not seem as effective as a course of antibiotics but fewer women reported side effects from one dose. This review recommended that more research is needed to discover the best way of treating asymptomatic bacteriuria.

A different review found that preterm births happened less for pregnant women who had routine testing for low genital tract infections than for women who only had testing when they showed symptoms of low genital tract infections. The women being routinely tested also gave birth to fewer babies with a low birth weight. Even though these results look promising, the review was only based on one study so more research is needed into routine screening for low genital tract infections.

Also periodontal disease has been shown repeatedly to be linked to preterm birth. In contrast, viral infections, unless accompanied by a significant febrile response, are considered not to be a major factor in relation to preterm birth.

====Genetics====
There is believed to be a maternal genetic component in preterm birth. Estimated heritability of timing-of-birth in women was 34%. However, the occurrence of preterm birth in families does not follow a clear inheritance pattern, thus supporting the idea that preterm birth is a non-Mendelian trait with a polygenic nature.

====Prenatal care====
The absence of prenatal care has been associated with higher rates of preterm births. Analysis of 15,627,407 live births in the United States in 1995–1998 concluded that the absence of prenatal care carried a 2.9 (95%CI 2.8, 3.0) times higher risk of preterm births. This same study found statistically significant relative risks of maternal anemia, intrapartum fever, unknown bleeding, renal disease, placental previa, hydramnios, placenta abruption, and pregnancy-induced hypertension with the absence of prenatal care. All these prenatal risks were controlled for other high-risk conditions, maternal age, gravidity, marital status, and maternal education. The absence of prenatal care prior to and during the pregnancy is primarily a function of socioeconomic factors (low family income and education), access to medical consultations (large distance from the place of residence to the healthcare unit and transportation costs), quality of healthcare, and social support. Efforts to decrease rates of preterm birth should aim to increase the deficits posed by the aforementioned barriers and to increase access to prenatal care.

==Diagnosis==
===Placental alpha microglobulin-1===
Placental alpha microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1) has been the subject of several investigations evaluating its ability to predict imminent spontaneous preterm birth in women with signs, symptoms, or complaints suggestive of preterm labor. In one investigation comparing this test to fetal fibronectin testing and cervical length measurement via transvaginal ultrasound, the test for PAMG-1 (commercially known as the PartoSure test) has been reported to be the single best predictor of imminent spontaneous delivery within 7 days of a patient presenting with signs, symptoms, or complaints of preterm labor. Specifically, the PPV, or positive predictive value, of the tests were 76%, 29%, and 30% for PAMG-1, fFN and CL, respectively (P &lt; 0.01).

===Fetal fibronectin===
Fetal fibronectin (fFN) has become an important biomarker—the presence of this glycoprotein in the cervical or vaginal secretions indicates that the border between the chorion and decidua has been disrupted. A positive test indicates an increased risk of preterm birth, and a negative test has a high predictive value. It has been shown that only 1% of women in questionable cases of preterm labor delivered within the next week when the test was negative.

===Ultrasound===

Obstetric ultrasound has become useful in the assessment of the cervix in women at risk for premature delivery. A short cervix preterm is undesirable: A cervical length of less than at or before 24 weeks of gestational age is the most common definition of cervical incompetence.

=== Emerging Technologies ===
Technologies under research and development to facilitate earlier diagnosis of preterm births include sanitary pads that identify biomarkers such as fFN and PAMG-1 and others, when placed into the vagina. These devices then calculate a risk of preterm birth and send the findings to a smartphone. The notion that risk scoring systems are accurate in predicting preterm birth has been debated in multiple literature reviews.

===Classification===

In humans, the usual definition of preterm birth is birth before a gestational age of 37 complete weeks. In the normal human fetus, several organ systems mature between 34 and 37 weeks, and the fetus reaches adequate maturity by the end of this period. One of the main organs greatly affected by premature birth is the lungs. The lungs are one of the last organs to mature in the womb; because of this, many premature babies spend the first days and weeks of their lives on ventilators. Therefore, a significant overlap exists between preterm birth and prematurity. Generally, preterm babies are premature and term babies are mature. Preterm babies born near 37 weeks often have no problems relating to prematurity if their lungs have developed adequate surfactant, which allows the lungs to remain expanded between breaths. Sequelae of prematurity can be reduced to a small extent by using drugs to accelerate maturation of the fetus, and to a greater extent by preventing preterm birth.

==Prevention==
Historically efforts have been primarily aimed to improve survival and health of preterm infants (tertiary intervention). Such efforts, however, have not reduced the incidence of preterm birth. Increasingly primary interventions that are directed at all women, and secondary intervention that reduce existing risks are looked upon as measures that need to be developed and implemented to prevent the health problems of premature infants and children. Smoking bans are effective in decreasing preterm births. Different strategies are used in the administration of prenatal care, and future studies need to determine if the focus can be on screening for high-risk women, or widened support for low-risk women, or to what degree these approaches can be merged.

===Before pregnancy===
Adoption of specific professional policies can immediately reduce risk of preterm birth as the experience in assisted reproduction has shown when the number of embryos during embryo transfer was limited.
Many countries have established specific programs to protect pregnant women from hazardous or night-shift work and to provide them with time for prenatal visits and paid pregnancy-leave. The EUROPOP study showed that preterm birth is not related to type of employment, but to prolonged work (over 42 hours per week) or prolonged standing (over 6 hours per day). Also, night work has been linked to preterm birth. Health policies that take these findings into account can be expected to reduce the rate of preterm birth. Preconceptional intake of folic acid is recommended to reduce birth defects. There is also some evidence that folic acid supplement preconceptionally (before becoming pregnant) may reduce premature birth. Reducing smoking is expected to benefit pregnant women and their offspring.

===During pregnancy===

Self-care methods to reduce the risk of preterm birth include proper nutrition, avoiding stress, seeking appropriate medical care, avoiding infections, and the control of preterm birth risk factors (e.g. working long hours while standing on feet, carbon monoxide exposure, domestic abuse, and other factors). Reducing physical activity during pregnancy has not been shown to reduce the risk of a preterm birth. Healthy eating can be instituted at any stage of the pregnancy including nutritional adjustments and consuming suggested vitamin supplements. Calcium supplementation in women who have low dietary calcium may reduce the number of negative outcomes including preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, and maternal death. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests 1.5–2 g of calcium supplements daily, for pregnant women who have low levels of calcium in their diet. Supplemental intake of C and E vitamins have not been found to reduce preterm birth rates.

While periodontal infection has been linked with preterm birth, randomized trials have not shown that periodontal care during pregnancy reduces preterm birth rates. Smoking cessation has also been shown to reduce the risk. The use of personal at home uterine monitoring devices to detect contractions and possible preterm births in women at higher risk of having a preterm baby have been suggested. These home monitors may not reduce the number of preterm births, however, using these devices may increase the number of unplanned antenatal visits and may reduce the number of babies admitted to special care when compared with women receiving normal antenatal care. Support from medical professionals, friends, and family during pregnancy may be beneficial at reducing caesarean birth and may reduce prenatal hospital admissions, however, these social supports alone may not prevent preterm birth.

====Screening during pregnancy====
Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria followed by appropriate treatment reduces pyelonephritis and reduces the risk of preterm birth. Extensive studies have been carried out to determine if other forms of screening in low-risk women followed by appropriate intervention are beneficial, including screening for and treatment of &quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot;, group B streptococcus, &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;, and bacterial vaginosis did not reduce the rate of preterm birth. Routine ultrasound examination of the length of the cervix may identify women at risk of preterm labour and tentative evidence suggests ultrasound measurement of the length of the cervix in those with preterm labor can help adjust management and results in the extension of pregnancy by about four days. Screening for the presence of fibronectin in vaginal secretions is not recommended at this time in women at low risk of preterm birth.

===Reducing existing risks===
Women are identified to be at increased risk for preterm birth on the basis of their past obstetrical history or the presence of known risk factors. Preconception intervention can be helpful in selected patients in a number of ways. Patients with certain uterine anomalies may have a surgical correction (i.e. removal of a uterine septum), and those with certain medical problems can be helped by optimizing medical therapies prior to conception, be it for asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and others.

====Multiple pregnancies====
In multiple pregnancies, which often result from use of assisted reproductive technology, there is a high risk of preterm birth. Selective reduction is used to reduce the number of fetuses to two or three.

====Reducing indicated preterm birth====
A number of agents have been studied for the secondary prevention of indicated preterm birth. Trials using low-dose aspirin, fish oil, vitamin C and E, and calcium to reduce preeclampsia demonstrated some reduction in preterm birth only when low-dose aspirin was used. Even if agents such as calcium or antioxidants were able to reduce preeclampsia, a resulting decrease in preterm birth was not observed.

====Reducing spontaneous preterm birth====
Reduction in activity by the mother—pelvic rest, limited work, bed rest—may be recommended although there is no evidence it is useful with some concerns it is harmful. Increasing medical care by more frequent visits and more education has not been shown to reduce preterm birth rates. Use of nutritional supplements such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is based on the observation that populations who have a high intake of such agents are at low risk for preterm birth, presumably as these agents inhibit production of proinflammatory cytokines. A randomized trial showed a significant decline in preterm birth rates, and further studies are in the making.

=====Antibiotics=====

While antibiotics can get rid of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, this does not appear to change the risk of preterm birth. It has been suggested that chronic chorioamnionitis is not sufficiently treated by antibiotics alone (and therefore they cannot ameliorate the need for preterm delivery in this condition).

=====Progestogens=====

Progestogens—often given in the form of vaginal progesterone or hydroxyprogesterone caproate—relax the uterine musculature, maintain cervical length, and possess anti-inflammatory properties; all of which invoke physiological and anatomical changes considered to be beneficial in reducing preterm birth. Two meta-analyses demonstrated a reduction in the risk of preterm birth in women with recurrent preterm birth by 40–55%.

Progestogen supplementation also reduces the frequency of preterm birth in pregnancies where there is a short cervix. A short cervix is one that is less than 25mm, as detected during a transvaginal cervical length assessment in the midtrimester. However, progestogens are not effective in all populations, as a study involving twin gestations failed to see any benefit. Despite extensive research related to progestogen effectiveness, uncertainties remain concerning types of progesterone and routes of administration.

=====Cervical cerclage=====

In preparation for childbirth, the woman&#x27;s cervix shortens. Preterm cervical shortening is linked to preterm birth and can be detected by ultrasonography. Cervical cerclage is a surgical intervention that places a suture around the cervix to prevent its shortening and widening. Numerous studies have been performed to assess the value of cervical cerclage and the procedure appears helpful primarily for women with a short cervix and a history of preterm birth. Instead of a prophylactic cerclage, women at risk can be monitored during pregnancy by sonography, and when shortening of the cervix is observed, the cerclage can be performed.

==Treatment==

Tertiary interventions are aimed at women who are about to go into preterm labor, or rupture the membranes or bleed preterm. The use of the fibronectin test and ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and reduces false-positive diagnosis. While treatments to arrest early labor where there is progressive cervical dilatation and effacement will not be effective to gain sufficient time to allow the fetus to grow and mature further, it may defer delivery sufficiently to allow the mother to be brought to a specialized center that is equipped and staffed to handle preterm deliveries. In a hospital setting women are hydrated via intravenous infusion (as dehydration can lead to premature uterine contractions).

If a baby has cardiac arrest at birth and is less than 22 to 24 weeks gestational age, attempts at resuscitation are not generally indicated.

===Steroids===
Severely premature infants may have underdeveloped lungs because they are not yet producing their own surfactant. This can lead directly to respiratory distress syndrome, also called hyaline membrane disease, in the neonate. To try to reduce the risk of this outcome, pregnant mothers with threatened premature delivery prior to 34 weeks are often administered at least one course of glucocorticoids, an antenatal steroid that crosses the placental barrier and stimulates the production of surfactant in the lungs of the baby. Steroid use up to 37 weeks is also recommended by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Typical glucocorticoids that would be administered in this context are betamethasone or dexamethasone, often when the pregnancy has reached viability at 23 weeks.

In cases where premature birth is imminent, a second &quot;rescue&quot; course of steroids may be administered 12 to 24 hours before the anticipated birth. There are still some concerns about the efficacy and side effects of a second course of steroids, but the consequences of RDS are so severe that a second course is often viewed as worth the risk. A 2015 Cochrane review (updated in 2022) supports the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course.

A Cochrane review from 2020 recommends the use of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturation in women at risk of preterm birth. Treatment with antenatal corticosteroids reduces the risk of perinatal death, neonatal death and respiratory distress syndrome and probably reduces the risk of IVH.

Concerns about adverse effects of prenatal corticosteroids include increased risk for maternal infection, difficulty with diabetic control, and possible long-term effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes for the infants. There is ongoing discussion about when steroids should be given (i.e. only antenatally or postnatally too) and for how long (i.e. single course or repeated administration). Despite these unknowns, there is a consensus that the benefits of a single course of prenatal glucocorticosteroids vastly outweigh the potential risks.

=== Antibiotics ===
The routine administration of antibiotics to all women with threatened preterm labor reduces the risk of the baby being infected with group B streptococcus and has been shown to reduce related mortality rates.

When membranes rupture prematurely, obstetrical management looks for development of labor and signs of infection. Prophylactic antibiotic administration has been shown to prolong pregnancy and reduced neonatal morbidity with rupture of membranes at less than 34 weeks. Because of concern about necrotizing enterocolitis, amoxicillin or erythromycin has been recommended but not amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav).

===Tocolysis===
A number of medications may be useful to delay delivery including: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, calcium channel blockers, beta mimetics, and atosiban. Tocolysis rarely delays delivery beyond 24–48 hours. This delay, however, may be sufficient to allow the pregnant woman to be transferred to a center specialized for management of preterm deliveries and give administered corticosteroids to reduce neonatal organ immaturity. Meta-analyses indicate that calcium-channel blockers and an oxytocin antagonist can delay delivery by 2–7 days, and β2-agonist drugs delay by 48 hours but carry more side effects. Magnesium sulfate does not appear to be useful to prevent preterm birth. Its use before delivery, however, does appear to decrease the risk of cerebral palsy.

=== Mode of delivery ===
The routine use of caesarean section for early delivery of infants expected to have very low birth weight is controversial, and a decision concerning the route and time of delivery probably needs to be made on a case-by-case basis.

===Neonatal care===

In developed countries premature infants are usually cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The physicians who specialize in the care of very sick or premature babies are known as neonatologists. In the NICU, premature babies are kept under radiant warmers or in incubators (also called isolettes), which are bassinets enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs. Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, cardiac function, oxygenation, and brain activity. After delivery, plastic wraps or warm mattresses are useful to keep the infant warm on their way to the NICU. Treatments may include fluids and nutrition through intravenous catheters, oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation support, and medications. In developing countries where advanced equipment and even electricity may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as &quot;kangaroo care&quot; (skin to skin warming), encouraging breastfeeding, and basic infection control measures can significantly reduce preterm morbidity and mortality. Kangaroo mother care (KMC) can decrease the risk of neonatal sepsis, hypothermia, hypoglycemia and increase exclusive breastfeeding. Bili lights may also be used to treat newborn jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia).

Water can be carefully provided to prevent dehydration but not so much to increase risks of side effects.

==== Breathing support ====
In terms of respiratory support, there may be little or no difference in the risk of death or chronic lung disease between high flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). For extremely preterm babies (born before 28 weeks&#x27; gestation), targeting a higher versus a lower oxygen saturation range makes little or no difference overall to the risk of death or major disability. Babies born before 32 weeks have been shown to have a lower risk of death from bronchopulmonary dysplasia if they have CPAP immediately after being born, compared to receiving either supportive care or assisted ventilation.

There is insufficient evidence for or against placing preterm stable twins in the same cot or incubator (co-bedding).

===Nutrition===
Meeting the appropriate nutritional needs of preterm infants is important for long-term health. Optimal care may require a balance of meeting nutritional needs and preventing complications related to feeding. The ideal growth rate is not known, however, preterm infants usually require a higher energy intake compared to babies who are born at term. The recommended amount of milk is often prescribed based on approximated nutritional requirements of a similar aged fetus who is not compromised. An immature gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), medical conditions (or co-morbidities), risk of aspirating milk, and necrotizing enterocolitis may lead to difficulties in meeting this high nutritional demand and many preterm infants have nutritional deficits that may result in growth restrictions. In addition, very small preterm infants cannot coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing. Tolerating a full enteral feeding (the prescribed volume of milk or formula) is a priority in neonatal care as this reduces the risks associated with venous catheters including infection, and may reduce the length of time the infant requires specialized care in the hospital. Different strategies can be used to optimize feeding for preterm infants. The type of milk/formula and fortifiers, route of administration (by mouth, tube feeding, venous catheter), timing of feeding, quantity of milk, continuous or intermittent feeding, and managing gastric residuals are all considered by the neonatal care team when optimizing care. The evidence in the form of high quality randomized trials is generally fairly weak in this area, and for this reason different neonatal intensive care units may have different practices and this results in a fairly large variation in practice. The care of preterm infants also varies in different countries and depends on resources that are available.

==== Human breast milk and formula ====
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding &quot;significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,&quot; including lower rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials about the effects of feeding preterm infants with formula compared with mother&#x27;s own breast milk, data collected from other types of studies suggest that mother&#x27;s own breast milk is likely to have advantages over formula in terms of the baby&#x27;s growth and development. Milk from human donors also reduces the risk of NEC by half in very low birth rate infants and very preterm infants.

Breast milk or formula alone may not be sufficient to meet the nutritional needs of some preterm infants. Fortification of breast milk or formula by adding extra nutrients is an approach often taken for feeding preterm infants, with the goal of meeting the high nutritional demand. High quality randomized controlled trials are needed in this field to determine the effectiveness of fortification. It is unclear if fortification of breast milk improves outcomes in preterm babies, though it may speed growth. Supplementing human milk with extra protein may increase short-term growth but the longer-term effects on body composition, growth and brain development are uncertain. Higher protein formula (between 3 and 4 grams of protein per kilo of body weight) may be more effective than low protein formula (less than 3 grams per kilo per day) for weight gain in formula-fed low-birth-weight infants. There is insufficient evidence about the effect on preterm babies&#x27; growth of supplementing human milk with carbohydrate, fat, and branched-chain amino acids. Conversely, there is some indication that preterm babies who cannot breastfeed may do better if they are fed only with diluted formula compared to full strength formula but the clinical trial evidence remains uncertain.

Individualizing the nutrients and quantities used to fortify enteral milk feeds in infants born with very low birth weight may lead to better short-term weight gain and growth but the evidence is uncertain for longer term outcomes and for the risk of serious illness and death. This includes targeted fortification (adjusting the level of nutrients in response to the results of a test on the breast milk) and adjustable fortification (adding nutrients based on testing the infant).

Multi-nutrient fortifier used to fortify human milk and formula has traditionally been derived from bovine milk. Fortifier derived from humans is available, however, the evidence from clinical trials is uncertain and it is not clear if there are any differences between human-derived fortifier and bovine-derived fortifier in terms of neonatal weight gain, feeding intolerance, infections, or the risk of death.

==== Timing of feeds ====
For very preterm infants, most neonatal care centres start milk feeds gradually, rather than starting with a full enteral feeding right away, however, is not clear if starting full enteral feeding early effects the risk of necrotising enterocolitis. In these cases, the preterm infant would be receiving the majority of their nutrition and fluids intravenously. The milk volume is usually gradually increased over the following weeks. Research into the ideal timing of enteral feeding and whether delaying enteral feeding or gradually introducing enteral feeds is beneficial at improving growth for preterm infants or low birth weight infants is needed. In addition, the ideal timing of enteral feeds to prevent side effects such as necrotising enterocolitis or mortality in preterm infants who require a packed red blood cell transfusion is not clear. Potential disadvantages of a more gradual approach to feeding preterm infants associated with less milk in the gut and include slower GI tract secretion of hormones and gut motility and slower microbial colonization of the gut.

Regarding the timing of starting fortified milk, preterm infants are often started on fortified milk/formula once they are fed 100 mL/kg of their body weight. Other some neonatal specialists feel that starting to feed a preterm infant fortified milk earlier is beneficial to improve intake of nutrients. The risks of feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis related to early versus later fortification of human milk are not clear. Once the infant is able to go home from the hospital there is limited evidence to support prescribing a preterm (fortified) formula.

==== Intermittent feeding versus continuous feeding ====
For infants who weigh less than 1500 grams, tube feeding is usually necessary. Most often, neonatal specialists feed preterm babies intermittently with a prescribed amount of milk over a short period of time. For example, a feed could last 10–20 minutes and be given every 3 hours. This intermittent approach is meant to mimic conditions of normal bodily functions involved with feeding and allow for a cyclic pattern in the release of gastrointestinal tract hormones to promote development of the gastrointestinal system. In certain cases, continuous nasogastric feeding is sometimes preferred. There is low to very low certainty evidence to suggest that low birth weight babies who receive continuous nasogastic feeding may reach the benchmark of tolerating full enteral feeding later than babies fed intermittently and it is not clear if continuous feeding has any effect on weight gain or the number of interruptions in feedings. Continuous feeding may have little to no effect on length of body growth or head circumference and the effects of continuous feeding on the risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis is not clear.

Since preterm infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease do not have a fully developed antireflux mechanism, deciding on the most effective approach for nutrition is important. It is not clear if continuous bolus intragastric tube feeding is more effective compared to intermittent bolus intragastric tube feeding for feeding preterm infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease.

For infants who would benefit from intermittent bolus feeding, some infants may be fed using the &quot;push feed&quot; method using a syringe to gently push the milk or formula into the stomach of the infant. Others may be fed using a gravity feeding system where the syringe is attached directly to a tube and the milk or formula drips into the infant&#x27;s stomach. It is not clear from medical studies which approach to intermittent bolus feeding is more effective or reduces adverse effects such as apnea, bradycardia, or oxygen desaturation episodes.

==== High volume feeds ====
High-volume (more than 180 mL per kilogram per day) enteral feeds of fortified or non-fortified human breast milk or formula may improve weight gain while the pre-term infant is hospitalized, however, there is insufficient evidence to determine if this approach improves growth of the neonate and other clinical outcomes including length of hospital stay. The risks or adverse effects associated with high-volume enteral feeding of preterm infants including aspiration pneumonia, reflux, apnea, and sudden oxygen desaturation episodes have not been reported in the trials considered in a 2021 systematic review.

==== Parenteral (intraveneous) nutrition ====
For preterm infants who are born after 34 weeks of gestation (&quot;late preterm infants&quot;) who are critically ill and cannot tolerate milk, there is some weak evidence that the infant may benefit from including amino acids and fats in the intravenous nutrition at a later time point (72 hours or longer from hospital admission) versus early (less than 72 hours from admission to hospital), however further research is required to understand the ideal timing of starting intravenous nutrition.

==== Gastric residuals ====
For preterm infants in neonatal intensive care on gavage feeds, monitoring the volume and colour of gastric residuals, the milk and gastrointestinal secretions that remain in the stomach after a set amount of time, is common standard of care practice. Gastric residual often contains gastric acid, hormones, enzymes, and other substances that may help improve digestion and mobility of the gastrointestinal tract. Analysis of gastric residuals may help guide timing of feeds. Increased gastric residual may indicate feeding intolerance or it may be an early sign of necrotizing enterocolitis. Increased gastric residual may be caused by an underdeveloped gastrointestinal system that leads to slower gastric emptying or movement of the milk in the intestinal tract, reduced hormone or enzyme secretions from the gastrointestinal tract, duodenogastric reflux, formula, medications, and/or illness. The clinical decision to discard the gastric residuals (versus re-feeding) is often individualized based on the quantity and quality of the residual. Some experts also suggest replacing the fresh milk or curded milk and bile-stained aspirates, but not replacing haemorrhagic residual. Evidence to support or refute the practice of re-feeding preterm infants with gastric residuals is lacking.

=== Hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia ===
Imbalances of sodium (hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia) are common in babies born preterm. Hypernatraemia (sodium levels in the serum of more than 145-150 mmol/L) is common early on in preterm babies and the risk of hyponatraemia (sodium levels of less than 135 nmol/L) increases after about a week of birth if left untreated and prevention approaches are not used. Preventing complications associated with sodium imbalances is part of standard of care for preterm infants and includes careful monitoring of water and sodium given to the infant. The optimal sodium dose given immediately after birth (first day) is not clear and further research is needed to understand the idea management approach.

=== Hearing assessment===
The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) state that for preterm infants who are in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for a prolonged time should have a diagnostic audiologic evaluation before they are discharged from the hospital. Well babies follow a 1-2-3-month benchmark timeline where they are screened, diagnosed, and receiving intervention for a hearing loss. However, for very premature babies, it might not be possible to complete a hearing screen at one month of age due to several factors. Once the baby is stable, an audiologic evaluation should be performed. For premature babies in the NICU, auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing is recommended. If the infant does not pass the screen, they should be referred for an audiologic evaluation by an audiologist. If the infant is on aminoglycosides such as gentamicin for less than five days they should be monitored and have a follow-up 6–7 months of being discharged from the hospital to ensure there is no late onset hearing loss due to the medication.

==Outcomes and prognosis==
Preterm births can result in a range of problems including mortality and physical and mental delays.

===Mortality and morbidity===
In the U.S. where many neonatal infections and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25%. Prematurely born infants are also at greater risk for having subsequent serious chronic health problems as discussed below.

The earliest gestational age at which the infant has at least a 50% chance of survival is referred to as the limit of viability. As NICU care has improved over the last 40 years, the limit of viability has reduced to approximately 24 weeks. Most newborns who die, and 40% of older infants who die, were born between 20 and 25.9 weeks (gestational age), during the second trimester.

As risk of brain damage and developmental delay is significant at that threshold even if the infant survives, there are ethical controversies over the aggressiveness of the care rendered to such infants. The limit of viability has also become a factor in the abortion debate.

===Specific risks for the preterm neonate===
Preterm infants usually show physical signs of prematurity in reverse proportion to the gestational age. As a result, they are at risk for numerous medical problems affecting different organ systems.
*Neurological problems can include apnea of prematurity, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), developmental disability, transient hyperammonemia, cerebral palsy, and intraventricular hemorrhage, the latter affecting 25% of babies born preterm, usually before 32 weeks of pregnancy. Mild brain bleeds usually leave no or few lasting complications, but severe bleeds often result in brain damage or even death. Neurodevelopmental problems have been linked to lack of maternal thyroid hormones, at a time when their own thyroid is unable to meet postnatal needs.
*Cardiovascular complications may arise from the failure of the ductus arteriosus to close after birth: patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).
*Respiratory problems are common, specifically the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS or IRDS) (previously called hyaline membrane disease). Another problem can be chronic lung disease (previously called bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD).
*Gastrointestinal and metabolic issues can arise from neonatal hypoglycemia, feeding difficulties, rickets of prematurity, hypocalcemia, inguinal hernia, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).
*Hematologic complications include anemia of prematurity, thrombocytopenia, and hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice) that can lead to kernicterus.
*Infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection 

=== Survival ===
The chance of survival at 22 weeks is about 6%, while at 23 weeks it is 26%, 24 weeks 55% and 25 weeks about 72% as of 2016. With extensive treatment up to 30% of those who survive birth at 22 weeks survive longer term as of 2019. The chances of survival without long-term difficulties is less. Of those who survive following birth at 22 weeks 33% have severe disabilities. In the developed world, overall survival is about 90% while in low-income countries survival rates are about 10%.

Some children will adjust well during childhood and adolescence, although disability is more likely nearer the limits of viability. A large study followed children born between 22 and 25 weeks until the age of 6 years old. Of these children, 46% had moderate to severe disabilities such as cerebral palsy, vision or hearing loss and learning disabilities, 34% had mild disabilities, and 20% had no disabilities; 12% had disabling cerebral palsy. Up to 15% of premature infants have significant hearing loss.

As survival has improved, the focus of interventions directed at the newborn has shifted to reduce long-term disabilities, particularly those related to brain injury. Some of the complications related to prematurity may not be apparent until years after the birth. A long-term study demonstrated that the risks of medical and social disabilities extend into adulthood and are higher with decreasing gestational age at birth and include cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, disorders of psychological development, behavior, and emotion, disabilities of vision and hearing, and epilepsy. Standard intelligence tests showed that 41% of children born between 22 and 25 weeks had moderate or severe learning disabilities when compared to the test scores of a group of similar classmates who were born at full term. It is also shown that higher levels of education were less likely to be obtained with decreasing gestational age at birth. People born prematurely may be more susceptible to developing depression as teenagers.
Some of these problems can be described as being within the executive domain and have been speculated to arise due to decreased myelinization of the frontal lobes. Studies of people born premature and investigated later with MRI brain imaging, demonstrate qualitative anomalies of brain structure and grey matter deficits within temporal lobe structures and the cerebellum that persist into adolescence. Throughout life they are more likely to require services provided by physical therapists, occupational therapists, or speech therapists. They are more likely to develop type 1 diabetes (roughly 1.2 times the rate) and type 2 diabetes (1.5 times).

Despite the neurosensory, mental and educational problems studied in school age and adolescent children born extremely preterm, the majority of preterm survivors born during the early years of neonatal intensive care are found to do well and to live fairly normal lives in young adulthood. Young adults born preterm seem to acknowledge that they have more health problems than their peers, yet feel the same degree of satisfaction with their quality of life.

Beyond the neurodevelopmental consequences of prematurity, infants born preterm have a greater risk for many other health problems. For instance, children born prematurely have an increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease.

==Epidemiology==

Preterm birth complicates 5–18% of births worldwide. In Europe and many developed countries the preterm birth rate is generally 5–9%, while in the U.S. from 2007 to 2022 the rate fluctuated from 9.6 to 10.5 per cent.

As weight is easier to determine than gestational age, the World Health Organization tracks rates of low birth weight (&lt; 2,500 grams), which occurred in 16.5% of births in less developed regions in 2000. It is estimated that one third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to preterm delivery. Weight generally correlates to gestational age; however, infants may be underweight for other reasons than a preterm delivery. Neonates of low birth weight (LBW) have a birth weight of less than and are mostly but not exclusively preterm babies as they also include &quot;small for gestational age&quot; (SGA) babies. Weight-based classification further recognizes &quot;Very Low Birth Weight&quot; (VLBW) which is less than 1,500 g, and &quot;Extremely Low Birth Weight&quot; (ELBW) which is less than 1,000 g. Almost all neonates in these latter two groups are born preterm.

About 75% of nearly a million deaths due to preterm delivery would survive if provided warmth, breastfeeding, treatments for infection, and breathing support. Complications from preterm births resulted in 740,000 deaths in 2013, down from 1.57 million in 1990.

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
Preterm birth is a significant cost factor in healthcare, not even considering the expenses of long-term care for individuals with disabilities due to preterm birth. A 2003 study in the U.S. determined neonatal costs to be $224,400 for a newborn at 500–700 g versus $1,000 at over 3,000 g. The costs increase exponentially with decreasing gestational age and weight.
The 2007 Institute of Medicine report &quot;Preterm Birth&quot; found that the 550,000 premature babies born each year in the U.S. run up about $26 billion in annual costs, mostly related to care in neonatal intensive care units, but the real tab may top $50 billion.

===Notable cases===

James Elgin Gill (born on 20 May 1987 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) was the earliest premature baby in the world, until that record was broken in 2004. He was 128 days premature, 21 weeks 5 days gestation, and weighed . He survived.

In 2014, Lyla Stensrud, born in San Antonio, Texas, U.S., became the youngest premature baby in the world. She was born at 21 weeks 4 days and weighed 410 grams (less than a pound). Kaashif Ahmad resuscitated the baby after she was born. As of November 2018, Lyla was attending preschool. She had a slight delay in speech, but no other known medical issues or disabilities.

Amillia Taylor is also often cited as the most premature baby. She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, U.S., at 21 weeks and 6 days&#x27; gestation. This report has created some confusion as her gestation was measured from the date of conception (through &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization) rather than the date of her mother&#x27;s last menstrual period, making her appear 2 weeks younger than if gestation was calculated by the more common method. At birth, she was long and weighed . She had digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children&#x27;s Hospital on 20 February 2007.

The record for the smallest premature baby to survive was held for a considerable amount of time by Madeline Mann, who was born in 1989 at 26 weeks, weighing and measuring long. This record was broken in September 2004 by Rumaisa Rahman, who was born in the same hospital, Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Illinois. at 25 weeks&#x27; gestation. At birth, she was long and weighed . Her twin sister was also a small baby, weighing at birth. During pregnancy their mother had pre-eclampsia, requiring birth by caesarean section. The larger twin left the hospital at the end of December, while the smaller remained there until 10 February 2005 by which time her weight had increased to . Generally healthy, the twins had to undergo laser eye surgery to correct vision problems, a common occurrence among premature babies.

In May 2019, Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women &amp; Newborns in San Diego announced that a baby nicknamed &quot;Saybie&quot; had been discharged almost five months after being born at 23 weeks&#x27; gestation and weighing . Saybie was confirmed by Dr. Edward Bell of the University of Iowa, which keeps the Tiniest Babies Registry, to be the new smallest surviving premature baby in that registry.

Born in February 2009, at Children&#x27;s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Jonathon Whitehill was just 25 weeks&#x27; gestation with a weight of . He was hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit for five months, and then discharged.

Richard Hutchinson was born at Children&#x27;s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on June 5, 2020, at 21 weeks 2 days gestation. At birth he weighed . He remained hospitalized until November 2020, when he was then discharged.

On 5 July 2020 Curtis Means was born at the University of Alabama at Birmingham hospital at 21 weeks 1 day, and weighed . He was discharged in April 2021. , he is the current world record holder.

Historical figures who were born prematurely include Johannes Kepler (born in 1571 at seven months&#x27; gestation), Isaac Newton (born in 1642, small enough to fit into a quart mug, according to his mother), Winston Churchill (born in 1874 at seven months&#x27; gestation), and Anna Pavlova (born in 1885 at seven months&#x27; gestation).

=== Effect of the coronavirus pandemic ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, a drastic drop in the rate of premature births has been reported in many countries, ranging from a 20% reduction to a 90% drop in the starkest cases. Studies in Ireland and Denmark first noticed the phenomenon, and it has been confirmed elsewhere. There is no universally accepted explanation for this drop as of August 2020. Hypotheses include additional rest and support for expectant mothers staying at home, less air pollution due to shutdowns and reduced car fumes, and reduced likelihood of catching other diseases and viruses in general due to the lockdowns.

== Research ==
Brain injury is common among preterms, ranging from white matter injury to intraventricular and cerebellar haemorrhages. The characteristic neuropathology of preterms has been described as the &quot;encephalopathy of prematurity&quot;. The number of preterms that receive special education is doubled compared to the general population. School marks are lower and so are verbal learning, executive function, language skills, and memory performance scores, as well as IQ scores. Behaviourally, adolescents who were born very preterm and/or very low birth weight have similar self-reports of quality of life, health status and self-esteem as term controls.

Various structural magnetic resonance studies found consistent reductions in whole brain volume. The extensive list of particular regions with smaller volumes compared to controls includes many cortical areas (temporal, frontal, parietal, occipital and cingulate), the hippocampal regions, thalamus, basal ganglia, amygdala, brain stem, internal capsule, corpus callosum, and cerebellum. Brain volume reduction seems to be present throughout the whole brain. In contrast, larger volumes were found in some of the same areas including medial/anterior frontal, parietal and temporal cortex, cerebellum, middle temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus, as well as larger lateral ventricles on average. The cause of these inconsistencies are unknown. Additionally, reductions in cortical surface area/cortical thickness were found in the temporal lobes bilaterally and in left frontal and parietal areas. Thicker cortex was found bilaterally in the medial inferior and anterior parts of the frontal lobes and in the occipital lobes.
Gestational age was positively correlated with volumes of the temporal and fusiform gyri and sensorimotor cortex bilaterally, left inferior parietal lobule, brain stem, and various white matter tracts, as well as specific positive associations with the cerebellum and thalamus. Several structural brain alterations have been linked back to cognitive and behavioural outcome measures. For example, total brain tissue volume explained between 20 and 40% of the IQ and educational outcome differences between extremely preterm born adolescents and control adolescents. In another study, a 25% quartile decrease in white matter values in middle temporal gyrus was associated with a 60% increase in the risk of cognitive impairment. Nosarti and colleagues previously hypothesised that maturational patterns in preterm brains were consistent with the age-related stages typically observed in younger subjects. Their most recent study suggests, however, that their trajectory may not only be delayed but also fundamentally distinctive. Since both smaller and larger regional volumes were found in very preterm individuals compared to controls.

The evidence to support the use of osteopathic manipulations to provide benefit in neonatal care is weak.

<text>Consumers often choose not directly from the commodities that they purchase, but from commodities they transform into goods through a household [[production function]]. It is these goods that they value. The idea was originally proposed by Gary Becker, Kelvin Lancaster, and Richard Muth in the mid-1960s. The idea was introduced simultaneously into macroeconomics in two separate papers by Jess Benhabib, Richard Rogerson, and Randall Wright (1991); and Jeremy Greenwood and Zvi Hercowitz (1991). Household production theory has been used to explain the rise in married female labor-force participation over the course of the 20th century, as the result of labor-saving appliances. More recently with the rise of the DIY or Maker movement household production has become more sophisticated. For example, consumers can now convert plastic wire into high-value products with inexpensive 3-D printers in their own homes.

== Example ==

A simple example of this is baking a cake. The consumer purchases flour, eggs, and sugar and then uses labor, know-how, time and other resources producing a cake. The consumer did not really want the flour, sugar, or eggs, but purchased them to produce the cake for consumption (instead of buying it, e.g., from a bakery).

<doc id="429545" wikidata="Q1759592" url="?curid=429545" title="Evig pint">
<text>Evig pint (English: Eternally Tormented) is the second studio album by Norwegian alternative rock band Kaizers Orchestra, released on 3 February 2003.

==Background==
After the release of the best-selling &quot;Ompa til du dør&quot;, and the EPs &quot;Død manns tango&quot; and &quot;Mann mot mann&quot;, the band started writing new material. In February 2002, the band debuted the song &quot;Salt og pepper&quot; and continued to play it throughout 2002. Nothing new surfaced until the band played &quot;Djevelens orkester&quot; once in fall 2002. Shortly after, in November, the recording sessions for the new album started. Nearing the end of 2002, Kaizers Orchestra spoke about the new album. It was to be called &quot;Evig pint&quot;, and was due for release on 3 February 2003.

The album art features the band&#x27;s organist Helge Risa in his trademark gas mask before a dark brown background.

==Promotion==
In early 2003, the band released &quot;Di grind&quot; as a free download, exclusively on their website. They premiered the song &quot;Evig pint&quot; at the Spellemannsprisen award show (Norwegian Grammy Award).

==Style and lyrical themes==
Evig pint has a generally darker atmosphere than its predecessor, both musically and lyrically. A majority of the songs are about torment of the soul, heaven, hell, death and loneliness.

The lyrics also relate to each other to a lesser extent than &quot;Ompa til du dør&quot;. The band has said that the songs are more individual than their older compositions.

<doc id="429548" wikidata="Q494532" url="?curid=429548" title="Munmu of Silla">
<text>Munmu the great (626–681), personal name Kim Pŏm-min, was a Korean monarch who served as the 30th king of the Korean kingdom of Silla. He is usually considered to have been the first ruler of the Unified Silla period. Munmu was the son of King Muyeol and Munmyeong, who was the younger sister of Kim Yu-sin. Under his father&#x27;s reign, he held the office of &quot;pajinchan&quot;, who apparently was responsible for maritime affairs, and played a key role in developing the country&#x27;s diplomatic links with Tang China. He was born as Kim Pŏm-min and took the name Munmu when he succeeded his father to the throne. After his death, he was known by the title of Dragon King.
Munmu is known as one of the great rulers in the land of Korea. During his rule, he tried to achieve the welfare and happiness of the people and to improve the political and social system. He paid great attention to justice and equality and tried to avoid neglecting the people. Munmu also attached great importance to the development of culture and art and tried to promote them in the society. He even paid attention to creating an advanced cultural and educational environment.

== Family ==
*Father: King Muyeol
*Mother: Queen Munmyeong () of the Gimhae Kim clan
*Spouse: Queen Jaeui, of the Kim clan (자의왕후 김씨; d.681)
**Son: Kim So-myŏng (? – 665)
**Son: Kim Chŏng-myŏng–who became King Sinmun, the 31st of Silla

==Unification of Three Kingdoms==
King Munmu took the throne in the midst of a long conflict against Baekje and Goguryeo, shortly after General Gyebaek and Baekje had been defeated at Sabi by General Kim Yu-sin in 660. In these struggles, Silla was heavily aided by the Tang.

The first years of his reign were spent trying to defeat Goguryeo, following an abortive attempt in 661. Finally, in 667, he ordered another attack which led to the defeat of Goguryeo in 668. After the small isolated pockets of resistance were eliminated, Munmu was the first ruler ever to see the Korean peninsula completely unified.

===War with Tang China===
King Munmu then faced the challenge of freeing his country from Tang domination. After the fall of Goguryeo, Tang created the Protectorate General to Pacify the East and attempted to place the entire Korean peninsula, including Silla, under its rule. To prevent this, Munmu forged alliances with Goguryeo resistance leaders such as Geom Mojam and Anseung, and launched a frontal attack on the Tang forces occupying former Baekje territories. The struggle lasted through the early 670s.

In 674, Tang and its former ally, Silla, were in constant battle, as King Munmu had taken over much of former Baekje and Goguryeo territory from the Tang and fostered resistance against them. Emperor Gaozong, in anger, arbitrarily declared King Munmu&#x27;s brother, Kim In-mun, as the king. However, King Munmu formally apologized and offered tribute, and Emperor Gaozong ordered a withdraw and recalled Kim In-mun.

In 675, Li Jinxing (Hanja:李謹行) reached Silla territory with Mohe forces that submitted to Tang. However, the Tang forces were defeated by the Silla army at the Maeso fortress (Tang sources claim that the Tang forces won this and other battles in Silla).

Emperor Gaozong ordered withdrawal of Tang forces from the Korean Peninsula entirely and moved the Protectorate General to Pacify the East to Liaodong, allowing Silla to eventually expel Tang out of the Korean Peninsula and unify the parts of the peninsula south of the Taedong River. This victory, and the maintenance of Silla&#x27;s independence, is generally regarded as a critical turning point in Korean history.

==After Unification Wars==
Munmu ruled over unified Silla for twenty years, until he fell ill in 681. On his deathbed, he left his last will and testament, and abdicated to his son, Prince Sinmun. Before he died he said: &quot;A country should not be without a king at any time. Let the Prince have my crown before he has my coffin. Cremate my remains and scatter the ashes in the sea where the whales live. I will become a dragon and thwart foreign invasion.&quot; King Sinmun did as his father asked, and scattered his ashes over Daewangam (the Rock of the Great King), a small rocky islet off the Korean coast. Moreover, King Sinmun built the Gomun Temple (the Temple of Appreciated Blessing) and dedicated it to his father, he built a waterway for the sea dragon to come to and from the sea and land, and he built a pavilion, Eegun, overlooking the islet so that future kings could pay their respects to the King Munmu.

In a dream, King Munmu and the general Kim Yu-sin appeared to King Sinmun and said to him: &quot;Blowing on a bamboo flute will calm the heavens and the earth.&quot; King Sinmun awoke from the dream, rode out to the sea and received the bamboo flute named Manpa-sikjeok (萬波息笛, 만파식적). It was said that the blowing of this bamboo flute invoked the spirits of King Munmu and General Kim Yu-sin and would push back enemy troops, cure illnesses, bring rain during drought and halt the rains in floods.

==Ancestry==
The &quot;Stele of Munmu Wang&quot; suggests that he was of the ethnic Xiongnu origin, or at least that parts of his family arrived from the Xiongnu.

<text>The Scottish Amateur Football Association (SAFA) is the organising body for amateur football across Scotland. An affiliate of the Scottish Football Association, the SAFA has in turn 50 regional associations affiliated to it and some 67 different league competitions organised by these associations. There is estimated to be over 35,000 amateur footballers in Scotland, and all of their competitions are co-ordinated at some level by the Scottish Amateur Football Association. The SAFA was formed in 1909 with the purpose of legislating for and fostering the amateur level of football in Scotland.

One amateur league is a member of the SFA instead of the SAFA – the North Caledonian Football League.

==History==

The Scottish Amateur Football Association (SAFA) was formed in 1909. After an initial meeting held in February, attended by 80 clubs from throughout Scotland, Queen&#x27;s Park, Glasgow &amp; District FP Football League and the Glasgow &amp; District Secondary Schools League met and agreed on the Association&#x27;s formation. James Allison, President of Queens Park FC, took the chair. The first office bearers were appointed in January 1910. On 28 May 1909, the Scottish Football Association (SFA) discussed a request for membership to the body from the SAFA. This was referred to the Special Committee who reported back in November of that year that a decision would be deferred until a full list of SAFA member clubs was submitted for approval. At this time five SAFA clubs had applied for direct membership of the SFA. It was not at all unusual to have joint membership as it permitted clubs to participate in competitions organised by the SFA. At a meeting on 14 December 1909, the SFA approved the membership of the SAFA.

The SAFA AGM in May 1914 reported three Associations and thirty two clubs in membership, and the Treasurer advised the Association was £21 in credit. The first round of the Scottish Cup was set for 16 January 1915, but amateur football literally stopped for the duration of the war. In October 1917, the SAFA advised the SFA that it was dormant as it had only one club in membership. At the May 1919 AGM, there were three Associations and 43 clubs in membership. By October 1919, 23 new clubs had entered the Association though five others had dropped out.

In December 1926, the SFA announced that they would be altering their Articles of Association. This meant that, from season 1927–28, the Scottish Junior Football Association (SJFA) and the SAFA were to be National Associations affiliated to the SFA. Each Association would be given a vote at SFA Council Meetings and the SFA was to set up an Appeals Committee to deal with appeals from each body.

Due to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the SFA declared all football in Scotland be suspended but minor associations could continue. During the war years an Emergency Committee was formed to run the SAFA affairs. By 1943, 12 Associations/Leagues had rejoined the SAFA including Lothian AFA, the Scottish Amateur Football League, the West of Scotland AFA, and 98 teams entered a &quot;West Cup&quot;. The 1945 AGM attracted only 14 Associations/Leagues and was not quorate though by July that year it was agreed to restart Scottish and District Cups together with the under-18 and under-16 national competitions.

Immediately after the war, most Leagues and Associations struggled to resurrect and made stuttering progress caused by loss of personnel, lack of equipment and kit, problems due to travel, effects of rationing. The SAFA AGM of 1946 saw 37 delegates attend and there were 126 entries for the Scottish Cup. The 1950 AGM saw membership rise to 58 Associations/ Leagues with 822 clubs and 242 Youth teams. A record 259 entries for the Scottish Cup in 1962 was exceeded in 1965 when 284 entered. At the 1970 AGM, there were 61 Associations/Leagues and 1,100 clubs in membership, while there were 413 entries for the Scottish Amateur Cup and the Association funds stood at £3,694.75.

Throughout the 1980s the SAFA grew at a great pace, and at the end of the decade it had 150 Associations/Leagues with 2,950 clubs and 3,700 teams. Between 1975 and 1983 the Association had doubled in size. This growth was due in the main to the popularity of Sunday football and the rapid growth of youth football. The Scottish Cup entries had reached 802, with 650 for the Famous Grouse Scotch Whisky Amateur Football Trophy.

The 100th year (2008–09) started with an entry of 598 teams for the Scottish Amateur Cup, despite falling numbers still the largest football competition in the country and continued on a bright financial note when a sponsorship agreement was signed with Scottish Brewers, using the brand name Fosters, for the Scottish Amateur Cup and the Scottish Amateur Sunday Trophy for a two-year period with an option for a further year.

==Amateur international team==

In November 1910, the SAFA asked the permission of the SFA to play an international match against England only to be told their request was premature. When the SAFA endeavoured to arrange a meeting with the SFA to discuss the matter, this was refused. In November 1912, the SAFA again requested permission to play an international match against England and were again turned down. The SFA advised the SAFA that in future if there were to be such a game, it would be under their jurisdiction. In March 1913, the SAFA requested the permission of the SFA to play teams on the continent. This was agreed to provided they played teams in membership of FIFA and all details were submitted to the SFA for approval. The SFA tried to arrange a game against England for December 1913, but this date was changed several times and then abandoned due to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

In May 1919, the (English) Football Association (FA) asked the SFA to play the elusive first international amateur match in the following season, but they had to decline as Queen&#x27;s Park refused to release their first team players. In March 1922, the SFA turned down the offer of an amateur international fixture against France and a further approach from the FA was met with a similar response. In April 1924, the SAFA again asked to play an international match against England, only to be told that a team without Queen&#x27;s Park players was not in the national interest.

However the SAFA agreed in August 1926 that an amateur international match would take place against England on 18 December 1926 in Leicester. The Scottish team consisted of seven Queens Park players, one from the Army and the other three from English senior teams. Scotland won 4–1 and the expenses came to £291.19.2 (£291,97). The second international match against England took place in May 1928, with Scotland winning 3–2 and showing a profit of £446.7.0 (£446.35). On this occasion there were eight Queens Park players, two anglos and I McDonald from Murrayfield Amateurs in the team. In early 1929, the SAFA asked the SFA if they could play internationals against Ireland and Wales, and these went ahead in October 1929, when Scotland beat Ireland 3–0, and in February 1930, when Wales were defeated 1–0.

In 1932 the SAFA were invited to have two representatives on the SFA Selection Committee and dates for the internationals against the three other home countries were established. The SFA decided that the players who represented their country would receive a gold medal. R Gillespie of Queens Park, who had captained Scotland in the historic first amateur international against England, was once again selected for the forthcoming international and was also capped and captained Scotland in the full international against France later that year.

The SAFA played the (English) Northern League and Northern Ireland (in Belfast) in 1947. The SAFA applied to the SFA to resume internationals against England and Wales but were refused on the grounds of &quot;not full strength teams&quot; and &quot;a team without Queen&#x27;s Park players would be deluding the public&quot;. The SAFA were again granted permission to play Northern League and Northern Ireland (in Dumfries) in May 1948. In an about turn by the SFA, the SAFA were told they could arrange future internationals against the other home countries. The SAFA arranged its first amateur international against Ireland in Aberdeen. There were seven Queen&#x27;s Park players in the team, but there was no happy ending to the first international match as Scotland were defeated.

In 1949 the SAFA received an invitation to play their French counterparts in Paris the following year but had to decline the offer as they could not afford to finance the trip nor could the players take the necessary five days off work to participate. In 1952, the SFA turned down a request from the SAFA to permit the televising of the amateur international v England. A first international match v Éire was arranged for Dublin in May 1953, with a return at Celtic Park the following year. In 1954 the SFA again resumed responsibility for amateur internationals.

==UEFA Regions&#x27; Cup==

Since 1999, the SAFA has provided a representative team to compete for Scotland in the biennial UEFA Regions&#x27; Cup for amateur footballers. This is usually made up of a squad from member clubs in one or more of the stronger regional leagues such as the Central Scottish AFL. Scotland do not have a strong record in the tournament, having never reached the Final tournament (last eight), although the quantity and quality of players available to the selectors is arguably lower than some other Regions&#x27; Cup entrants due to the unusual way non-professional football is organised in the country, whereby the many players involved in the game at Junior level are not considered for the amateur squads.

===Progress===

==Amateur Cup==

In February 1910, the SAFA asked the SFA to donate a Challenge Cup and badges (winners&#x27; medals) for annual competition, but in early March of that year the SFA advised the SAFA they understood that some of their member clubs had registered professional players and they must be investigated. Three clubs were expelled from the SAFA, and on 30 March 1910, the SFA agreed to present a cup to the value of £20 and the secretary was asked to obtain quotations for the design and cost. The cup was finally presented to the SAFA on 27 May 1910, to be known as the Scottish Amateur Cup.

Regardless of the outcome of the request to the SFA, the SAFA proceeded with a national cup competition. Twenty-three teams entered the first ever Scottish Amateur Cup competition in 1910. The competition got off to an inauspicious start when Kilmacolm protested about the ground conditions at their first round tie against Paisley Grammar School. The tie was replayed the following week with Paisley Grammar School winning. The first winners were John Neilson Institution FP AFC who defeated Paisley Academicals by 2–0 at Love Street Paisley in April 1910. No cup or medals were presented after the final. The cup was eventually presented to the winning side in December 1911 and the SAFA had specially commissioned solid gold badges presented to the winners. One of the teams, Vale of Atholl, current members of the Perthshire Amateur Football Association, are still in existence.

The Amateur Cup trophy was replaced by a replica in 2005, purchased by the SAFA at a cost of £13,550. The original was placed on permanent exhibit in the Scottish Football Museum at Hampden Park. The Amateur Cup is open for competition annually by all member clubs within the SAFA.

==The Scottish Amateur Sunday Trophy==

Presented by the SAFA to replace the Famous Grouse Scotch Whisky Amateur Football Trophy in 2005 at a cost of £1,675. Established in 2005 and competed for annually by teams in the Associations/Leagues affiliated to the SAFA who play Sunday football.

<text>The Sweeney is a British police drama television series focusing on two members of the Flying Squad, a branch of the Metropolitan Police specialising in tackling armed robbery and violent crime in London. It stars John Thaw as Detective Inspector Jack Regan and Dennis Waterman as his partner, Detective Sergeant George Carter. It was produced by the Thames Television subsidiary Euston Films for broadcast on the ITV network in the United Kingdom from 2 January 1975 to 28 December 1978.

The programme&#x27;s title comes from the Cockney rhyming slang term &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, used to refer to the Flying Squad by London&#x27;s criminal fraternity in the mid 20th century.

The popularity of the series in the UK led to two feature films &quot;Sweeney!&quot; (1977) and &quot;Sweeney 2&quot; (1978) both starring Thaw and Waterman, and a later film, &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (2012), starring Ray Winstone as Regan and Ben Drew as Carter.

==Background==
&quot;The Sweeney&quot; was developed from a one-off TV drama entitled &quot;Regan&quot;, which served as the pilot episode for the series. &quot;Regan&quot; is a 90-minute television film written by Ian Kennedy Martin for the Thames Television anthology series &quot;Armchair Cinema&quot; in 1974. The part of Jack Regan was written for John Thaw, who was a friend of Ian Kennedy Martin, with whom he had worked on the TV drama series &quot;Redcap&quot; in the 1960s. Dennis Waterman was cast after his performance in the &quot;Special Branch&quot; episode &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, also produced by Euston Films.

The &quot;Regan&quot; film was seen as having series potential from the very beginning. After it scored highly in the ratings, work began on the development of the series proper. Ian Kennedy Martin saw the subsequent series as being mainly studio-based, with more dialogue and less action, but producer Ted Childs, inspired in part by &quot;Get Carter&quot; and &quot;The French Connection&quot; (both 1971), disagreed. Following this battle for creative control, Ian Kennedy Martin parted company with the project. His role as series writer were filled by his brother Troy Kennedy Martin, Roger Marshall, Ranald Graham and Trevor Preston.

Every writer on the series was given guidelines, &quot;Each show will have an overall screen time (minus titles) of 48 minutes 40 seconds. Each film will open with a teaser of up to 3 minutes, which will be followed by the opening titles. The story will be played across three acts, each being no more than 19 minutes and no fewer than 8 minutes in length. Regan will appear in every episode, Carter in approximately 10 out of 13 episodes. In addition to these main characters, scripts should be based around three major speaking parts, with up to ten minor speaking parts&quot;.

Most TV police dramas had shied away from showing officers as fallible. The series shows a somewhat more realistic side of police life, depicting them as flawed human beings, some with a disregard for authority, rules and the &quot;system&quot;. Police officers in &quot;The Sweeney&quot; are ready and willing to meet violence with violence when dealing with London&#x27;s hardened criminals and are prone to cut corners and bend the law in pursuit of their prey, as long as it gets the right result. Until &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, the violent reality of policing was largely ignored by British television. The series broke new ground for TV drama and incorporated self-awareness and genre-referential humour. This is evident in episodes such as 2.7, &quot;Golden Fleece&quot;, when Regan brandishes a lollipop at Carter and says &quot;who loves ya, baby&quot; in a nod to hit US crime series &quot;Kojak&quot; (1973–78); or in 2.10, &quot;Trojan Bus&quot;, when Regan whistles the theme tune to the BBC&#x27;s sedate police series &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; (1955–76) after a particularly elementary piece of detective work.

The series also captured the zeitgeist as it was made during a dark period for the real-world Flying Squad. During the mid-1970s Flying Squad officers were publicly censured for being involved in bribery, corruption and for having excessively close links with the criminal fraternity. This reality served as a backdrop to the series and it is reflected in the mood, tone and story lines of &quot;The Sweeney&quot;. Detective Chief Superintendent Kenneth Drury, the Flying Squad&#x27;s real-life commander, was convicted on five counts of corruption and imprisoned for eight years. Twelve other officers were convicted and many more resigned. In the late 1970s, this and other scandals led to a massive internal investigation into the activities of the Metropolitan and City of London Police led by Dorset Police, codenamed Operation Countryman.

==Cast and characters==

===Main characters===
The two main protagonists are Detective Inspector Jack Regan (John Thaw) and Detective Sergeant George Carter (Dennis Waterman). The third is Detective Chief Inspector Frank Haskins (Garfield Morgan), their boss and a senior Flying Squad officer.

====Jack Regan====
John Thaw stars as Detective Inspector John Albert &quot;Jack&quot; Regan, a tough police officer, often frustrated by Scotland Yard&#x27;s red tape. Originally from Manchester (like Thaw himself), he has been in London for several years. He occasionally refers to his northern roots (his poor upbringing and his father&#x27;s work on the Manchester Ship Canal), which prompts banter from George Carter, a Londoner, such as humming &quot;The Red Flag&quot;. A heavy drinker and smoker, Regan has some success with women; although not as much as Carter. He has an ex-wife, Kate, and daughter, Susie, who live in Ruislip.

Regan may be tough, but he is also a decent man, seen to help out an ex-informer whose son is kidnapped in 4.9 &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;; and his sympathetic pushing enables his boss Haskins to ask for help when his wife goes missing after a breakdown, in 4.13 &quot;Victims&quot;; it is Regan who finds her. Regan will bend the rules in order to achieve the desired result: for example, fabricating evidence, arranging for a criminal to be kidnapped, illegally entering private property and threatening to lie about being attacked by a prisoner in order to get information. Despite this, he has his own very strong moral code. He is unwilling to cheat for personal gain, delivers a blistering attack on a corrupt police officer, and refuses to take bribes.

Although he is seen driving various cars himself throughout the series, Regan usually travels by squad car with a police driver.

====George Carter====
Dennis Waterman plays Detective Sergeant George Hamilton Carter who comes from south London. In the series&#x27; timeline, George was in the Flying Squad prior to events in &quot;Regan&quot;, but quit for family reasons (cf. &quot;Regan&quot; and 1.5 &quot;Jigsaw&quot;). Carter is less aggressive than Regan and usually plays the &quot;good cop&quot; role. He is married to Alison Carter, a schoolteacher, but is widowed when she is murdered in episode 2.5 &quot;Hit and Run&quot;. He is a former amateur boxer, as shown in the pilot &quot;Regan&quot;, and is described as having professional boxing potential in episode 2.1 &quot;Chalk and Cheese&quot;. Like Regan, he enjoys a drink and follows football. After the death of his wife, Carter is shown dating various women in several episodes.

====Frank Haskins====
Garfield Morgan plays Detective Chief Inspector Frank Haskins. He is married and has three children, all at boarding school, and is Regan&#x27;s immediate superior. Prior to the series timeline, the character had completed his National Service in the Signals Corps &quot;in a minor intelligence role&quot; (as revealed in episode 2.9 &quot;Stay Lucky, Eh?&quot;). He is frequently seen at odds with Regan, preferring more conventional &quot;by-the-book&quot; policing methods, though is still willing and able to &quot;mix it&quot; with villains on the street, giving Regan and Carter physical and/or armed support several times.

The main episodes featuring Haskins are 2.7 &quot;Golden Fleece&quot;, in which he is set up to be the victim of a corruption inquiry, and 4.13 &quot;Victims&quot;, in which his wife, Doreen, suffers a mental breakdown.

During the first three series, Morgan appears in the opening titles of every episode regardless of whether Haskins makes an appearance.

Haskins is absent at the start of the fourth and final series due to Garfield Morgan&#x27;s other professional commitments, but he returns a few episodes in. Correspondingly, there are two versions of the fourth series opening titles, one with, and one without, Haskins.

===Other recurring characters===

====The squad====
The series introduces several other squad officers over the years including: Detective Sergeant &quot;Matt&quot; Mathews (John Flanagan); Detective Sergeant Kent (Carl Rigg); Detective Constable Jimmy Thorpe (Martin Read); Detective Constable Jellineck (James Warrior); Detective Constable Gerry Burtonshaw (Nick Brimble); Detective Sergeant Tom Daniels (John Alkin).

Regan&#x27;s squad car comes with an &quot;authorised&quot; police driver. In the first series Regan has a variety of drivers including Len (Jack McKenzie), Fred (Denis DeMarne) and Brian Cooney (Billy Murray). Episode 1.7 &quot;The Placer&quot; introduces the character of Bill (Tony Allen) who becomes Regan&#x27;s regular driver, although he plays a peripheral, non-speaking role in most episodes. Allen subsequently worked as wardrobe manager for many of John Thaw&#x27;s later projects.

When Haskins is absent, other senior officers step in to manage the squad, including Detective Chief Inspector Stephen Quirk (Bill Maynard) and Detective Chief Inspector Anderson (Richard Wilson), sarcastically referred to as &quot;Andy Pandy&quot; by Regan, Carter, and other squad officers.

Other more senior officers include: Detective Chief Superintendent Maynon (Morris Perry), a semi-regular throughout the series and more willing than Haskins to bend the rules to get a result (later promoted to Commander); Detective Superintendent Grant (T.P. McKenna); Detective Chief Superintendent Braithwaite (Benjamin Whitrow). Colin Douglas features as an unnamed commander in series 1, with Michael Latimer as Commander Jackman in series 2.

The relationship between squad officers is largely informal. Regan is always referred to as &quot;Guv&#x27;nor&quot;, or just &quot;Guv&quot;. He invariably calls Carter and the other squad members by their first names, or occasionally nicknames. Carter, as Regan&#x27;s assigned sergeant, is frequently addressed by constables as &quot;Skipper&quot; or &quot;Skip&quot;. When off duty, Regan and Carter are friends and drinking buddies, so in private Carter calls him &quot;Jack&quot;. This is all in accordance with widespread police convention. Everyone calls DCI Haskins simply &quot;Haskins&quot; (or &quot;Mister Haskins&quot;), though Regan occasionally calls him by his first name, &quot;Frank&quot;.

==== The cars ====
The cars used in &quot;The Sweeney&quot; became almost as important to the series as any of the human characters.

The best known car in the series is NHK 295M, a metallic copper-bronze (&quot;Tawny Metallic&quot;) 1974 Ford Consul 3000 GT V6 (often mistaken for a Granada Mk1). As well as being the main squad car used to get Regan and Carter around London, it also features in the opening titles of series 1-3, driven by stunt man Joe Wadham.

Other squad cars featured include an onyx green 1973 Ford Granada 3.0 Ghia Mk1 (NHK 292M), a blue 1974 Ford Cortina 2000 XL Mk3 (NHK 296M) (usually shown as Carter&#x27;s car, but occasionally doubling as a Panda car with a light bar added to the roof), a bronze 1976 Ford Granada Mk1 3.0 Ghia X (RHJ 997R). The main squad cars were supplied for filming by Ford from its press fleet at no cost, and the producers were specifically told that the cars were not to be damaged. Such was the prominence of the company&#x27;s cars in the series, it was jokingly referred to as &quot;The Ford Squad&quot;. In later episodes Ford updated the cars, providing a metallic silver Mk1 Ford Granada S 3.0 V6 (NWC 301P), a silver 1978 Ford Granada Mk2 2.8iS (VHK 491S) and a silver Ford Cortina Mk4 2.0 GL (PNO 548R), among others.

The series is infamous for featuring Jaguars as the criminals&#x27; cars of choice. Jaguar S-types in particular were regularly deployed throughout the series as getaway cars, most notably in episode 1.10 &quot;Stoppo Driver&quot;. A blue/grey S-type DWD 606C is used in the series 1-3 opening titles, pursued and chased down by the squad in NHK 295M.

One reason cited for the regular appearance of Jaguars is that they were favoured by the stunt drivers as being the &quot;safest&quot; cars to use (stuntman Peter Brayham devised the chases). The same few cars would be used and re-used, crashed, fixed up, and resprayed numerous times. According to Kevin Whately, John Thaw claimed that he had witnessed the regency red 1960 Jaguar Mark 2 (registration 248 RPA) used in &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; being written off several times while filming &quot;The Sweeney&quot;. Apparently, the car was in real-life a &quot;polished up wreck&quot; and would often break down during filming.

A red Fiat 850 coupé (UJB 92G) makes cameo appearances in several episodes: typically, it is parked at the side of the road as the action takes place around it. One theory is that the car belonged to a crew member who tried to include it as an in-joke in as many episodes as possible.

====Family====
Other featured characters include the close family of the three leads.

Regan&#x27;s ex-wife Kate (Janet Key) appears in the pilot &quot;Regan&quot; and in episode 1.13 &quot;Abduction&quot;. Their daughter Susie (Jennifer Thanisch) appears most notably in &quot;Abduction&quot;.

Carter&#x27;s wife Alison (Stephanie Turner) is seen attempting to prise him away from the squad in episode 1.5 &quot;Jigsaw&quot;, while her hostility toward Regan is apparent in 1.13 &quot;Abduction&quot;. She is murdered in episode 2.5 &quot;Hit and Run&quot;. In the DVD commentary for &quot;Abduction&quot;, it is claimed that Alison was written out because actor Stephanie Turner was asking for too much money to continue to appear in the series. Turner went on to appear in &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot;, also devised and part-written by Ian Kennedy Martin.

Doreen Haskins (Sheila Reid) features in the penultimate episode 4.12 &quot;Victims&quot;, which deals with her deteriorating mental health and the impact of police work on family life. One of Haskins&#x27; three children, Richard, also appears in this episode.

== Production ==
&quot;The Sweeney&quot; strived for authenticity and social realism. This ethos was reflected in most aspects of production, from the storylines, casting, locations and most importantly the dialogue. As well as the series title, other Cockney rhyming slang gave extra colour to the dialogue, including &quot;poppy&quot; (money), &quot;bottle&quot; (courage) and &quot;grass&quot; (informer). Criminal and police slang was also used, including &quot;ringer&quot; (a car thief, also a stolen car with fake registration plates), &quot;stoppo&quot; (a getaway car), &quot;snout&quot; (informant), &quot;factory&quot; (police station/office), &quot;fence&quot; (selling stolen goods, also someone who sells stolen goods) and &quot;fireman&quot; (someone who deals with problems). Many of these slang terms were brought to a wider audience for the first time in &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, some even entered popular use, but the terms have remained part of the British crime drama landscape.

&quot;The Sweeney&quot; was shot on 16 mm film, allowing producers to use smaller, agile camera crews. This made it possible to shoot almost entirely on location for exteriors and interiors, helping to give the series a startling degree of realism and elevating London as a character of its own. Using film also allowed directors to feature many more action sequences. Directors Tom Clegg, Terry Green, Douglas Camfield, David Wickes, Mike Vardy and William Brayne were among the group of &quot;guerrilla filmmakers&quot; that realised the episodes. What they and the crews delivered is a fast-paced series, depicting the squad&#x27;s relentless battle against armed robbery; but it also includes a substantial degree of humour. For the period it has a high degree of on-screen violence, and it is not unknown for several deaths to occur in an episode.

Each episode had a budget of £40,000 with an eight-and-a-half-week production schedule: two weeks&#x27; pre-production (for casting, finding locations etc.), two weeks&#x27; shooting, four weeks&#x27; picture editing (the first two weeks of which overlapped with the shoot), two weeks&#x27; sound editing and two-and-a-half days&#x27; dubbing.

The filming of each episode normally took ten working days, shooting about five minutes of edited screen time per day. Due to this, the number of different filming locations had to be restricted to ten, i.e. one location per day. At the Euston Films production office in Colet Court, Hammersmith, a standing set of the Flying Squad offices was constructed which provided an alternative option for when inclement weather restricted the day&#x27;s shooting. Two days would normally be spent filming on the set, equalling ten minutes of any episode being set in the offices. Shooting took place through the spring, summer, autumn and winter months; exterior night shooting was expensive and was limited to three minutes of external night material in any episode.

===Filming location===
Most of the locations used for filming &quot;The Sweeney&quot; were around the west London area – in particular, Acton, Chiswick, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, Hammersmith, Fulham, Earl&#x27;s Court, Kensington &amp; Chelsea and Notting Hill districts, close to the Euston Films HQ at Colet Court in Hammersmith. The London Docklands, derelict at the time, were ideal for filming location sequences. The opening titles were filmed in Colet Gardens. However, other notable locations in London, the south-east of England and further afield were also used for filming the show&#x27;s episodes and included:

==Series overview==
==Episodes==

===Series 1 (1975)===
===Series 2 (1975)===
===Series 3 (1976)===
===Series 4 (1978)===
==Films==
The cinematic versions of &quot;The Sweeney&quot; feature the same actors and characters as the TV series, however both films have levels of swearing, violence, sex and nudity that would not have been possible on television at the time.

=== &quot;Sweeney!&quot; (1977) ===
In &quot;Sweeney!,&quot; Regan and Carter become involved in a plot which shares similarities to the 1963 Profumo affair and British actor Barry Foster features as an American socialite loosely based on Stephen Ward. Made in 1976, and released in 1977, the film appears to be set in 1979. On screen and in-film references include the line &quot;The same damned speech you made in 1978&quot; and a large banner at the OPEC delegates meeting features the convention&#x27;s logo and the year &quot;1979&quot;. This suggests that the events of the film occur after the end of the television series chronologically, assuming series 4 is set in 1978 as broadcast.

=== &quot;Sweeney 2&quot; (1978) ===
In &quot;Sweeney 2&quot;, Regan and Carter are on the trail of particularly violent armed criminals. The gang has carried out bank and payroll robberies all over London and killed anyone who got in their way, even their own members. Regan and Carter are assigned the case as a last order from Detective Chief Superintendent Jupp (Denholm Elliott) before he resigns to face allegations of corruption in the courts.

=== 2012 reboot ===
In director Nick Love&#x27;s film, the characters from the TV series are re-imagined, and the setting and action are moved to the early 21st century. &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (2012) stars Ray Winstone (who had a very minor role in the 1976 &quot;Sweeney&quot; episode &quot;Loving Arms&quot;) as Regan, Ben Drew as Carter and Damian Lewis as Haskins.

&quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Steve Rose gave Love&#x27;s film a one-star review, saying that &quot;rather than upgrading the 1970s TV favourite [the 2012 film] treats it like a stolen car – to be stripped down, resprayed and erased of identifying features. Only the brand name has been retained.&quot;

The 2012 film was remade in France as &quot;The Squad&quot; in 2015, also known as &quot;The Sweeney: Paris&quot;.

==Music==

The title theme music and end credit reprise were both written by Harry South, a key figure in British jazz during the 1950s and 1960s. Dave Gelly writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; called South&#x27;s title music &quot;the most emblematic TV theme of its day&quot;.

Incidental and background music for the series was selected from off-the-shelf production music libraries, including De Wolfe, KPM, Bruton and Chappell, Music by Steve Gray&#x27;s library music ensemble WASP was specially commissioned, and featured heavily in the series. Some of the music was later issued on KPM 1000 Series albums &quot;The Hunter&quot; (KPM 1157) and &quot;Drama&quot; (KPM 1168), both 1975. 

In 2001 a soundtrack album &quot;Shut it! The Music of The Sweeney&quot; was released, containing a selection of the incidental music used in the programme, some augmented with classic pieces of dialogue from various episodes. Also included on the album is the main title theme music from the first feature film, &quot;Sweeney!&quot;.

==Books==
Nine books were written and released in 1977 published by Futura Publications Ltd.
*&quot;The Sweeney&quot;
*&quot;Regan and the Manhattan File&quot;
*&quot;Regan and the Deal of the Century&quot;
*&quot;Regan and the Lebanese Shipment&quot;
*&quot;Regan and the Human Pipeline&quot;
*&quot;Regan and the Bent Stripper&quot;
*&quot;Regan and the Snout Who Cried Wolf&quot;
*&quot;Regan and the Venetian Virgin&quot;
*&quot;Regan and the High Rollers&quot;

The first three books were written by Ian Kennedy Martin, the rest by Joe Balham. The plots of the books are not taken from any of the television episodes; overall, the tone of the books differs somewhat from the television series in that Regan is usually depicted as working alone, and his relationship with Carter is distinctly unfriendly.

==Popular culture==

*In 1977, the BBC responded to the success of &quot;The Sweeney&quot; on ITV and commissioned its own hard-hitting police series, &quot;Target&quot;. It was heavily criticised for the levels of violence and the BBC cancelled it after two series.
*The repeat of the episode &quot;Selected Target&quot; on 21 December 1978 recorded the highest viewing figure of the series, with 19.05 million people watching. This coincided with a 24-hour strike at the BBC.
*&quot;The Sweeney&quot; is mentioned in the song &quot;Wow!&quot; by Kate Bush; and &quot;Cool For Cats&quot; by Squeeze.
*In the orange-tinted photographs that are shown in the closing credits for series 1–3, an enlarged set of fingerprints is displayed on a board behind Detective Chief Inspector Haskins.
*Reference is made to &quot;The Sweeney&quot; in the &quot;Black Books&quot; episode &quot;The Blackout&quot;.
*Regan and Carter appear briefly as part of a stakeout operation in one of the novelisations of the TV series &quot;The Professionals&quot;.
*Scotland Yard&#x27;s real Flying Squad lost an important surveillance technique when &quot;The Sweeney&quot; exposed their use of the roadside tents erected by telephone engineers, who would place them over open manholes in the street to protect them from the weather. These tents are frequently shown in the series as hideaways for keeping a covert eye on suspects.
*A two-part 1998 instalment of &quot;&quot;, &quot;Obsession&quot;, features lead villains named Carter Sweeney and Regan Sweeney.
*The creators of the show &quot;Life on Mars&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, have often stated that &quot;The Sweeney&quot; influenced both programmes.
*To date, one episode of &quot;The Sweeney&quot; has been shown on the BBC. It was shown on 31 May 1993 as part of the &quot;Cops on the Box&quot; segment of BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; season. The episode broadcast was &quot;Supersnout&quot;. It was introduced by Shaw Taylor, known for his &quot;Police 5&quot; series on ITV.
*In the UK, repeats were shown on UK Gold and Channel 5 in the 1990s. In the 2020s, episodes are repeated most weekdays on ITV4.

===&quot;Detectives on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot;===
The 1993 Comic Strip film &quot;Detectives on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; features a character introduced as &quot;Shouting George from &quot;The Weeny&quot;&quot; (played by Jim Broadbent).

===Comics===
In 1977 and 1978, publishers Brown Watson, which specialised in annuals based on TV series, published two editions of &quot;The Sweeney Annual&quot; featuring a mix of comic strips (some with art by Brian Lewis) and illustrated text stories, interspersed with occasional features on the TV series, articles about policing, puzzles and, in the 1978 annual, an interview with Thaw and Waterman.

From 1979, the comic &quot;Jackpot&quot; featured a strip called &quot;The Teeny Sweeney&quot; which was drawn by J. Edward Oliver. A trio of schoolboys played at being plain-clothes policemen, with two of them looking like little versions of Regan and Carter. They even had &quot;Flying Squad&quot; written on the side of their go-carts. Their attempts at being helpful, however, almost always ended in disaster.

===Nissan TV ad===
A TV ad for the Nissan Almera car in the late 1990s had two characters similar to Carter and Regan racing through London to deal with a &quot;bank job&quot;. A suspicious group of men have entered a bank dressed as painters. As &quot;Carter&quot; races the car through the streets, &quot;Regan&quot; keeps bellowing at him and others to &quot;Shut it!&quot;

At one stage, &quot;Regan&quot; shouts &quot;Mark it!&quot;, which is slang for following a suspect, but in this case, means &quot;market&quot; as &quot;Carter&quot; drives erratically through a marketplace. &quot;Carter&quot; tells &quot;Regan&quot; to stop shouting, to which &quot;Regan&quot; barks the reply &quot;I can&#x27;t!&quot;

When they burst into the bank, it turns out that the men are genuine painters and that &quot;Regan&quot;, their guv (or boss), is there to tell them they are using the wrong sort of white paint(!) &quot;Carter&quot; says, &quot;Think we&#x27;d better go back to the yard, guv, and get some more.&quot; &quot;Shut up!&quot;

One of the painters talks in a squeaky voice and is called &quot;Squealer&quot;, which is slang for informant.

<text>The Rassemblement pour l&#x27;Indépendance Nationale (; RIN; ) was a political organization dedicated to the promotion of Quebec national independence from Canada.

Torn during its existence between different ideological tendencies, the RIN essentially represented the left wing of the Quebec sovereignty movement of the 1960s.

The RIN participated in negotiations during 1968 with a view to unifying different independence parties but was ultimately excluded from the final negotiations leading to the formation of the Parti Québécois. On October 26, 1968, the party congress decided, on the proposal of President Pierre Bourgault, to dissolve and called on its members to join individually the Parti Québécois.

==History==
The Rassemblement pour l&#x27;Indépendance Nationale was founded on September 10, 1960, by about 30 people at the very beginning of the Quiet Revolution. The founders included many of former Alliance Laurentienne members. (The Alliance Laurentienne was dissolved after the creation of the RIN.) The founding members included André D&#x27;Allemagne, Jacques Bellemare, and Marcel Chaput. Other prominent members included Andrée Ferretti, Hubert Aquin and Raymond Villeneuve. D&#x27;Allemagne, having participated in the Alliance Laurentienne, said that he had found the Alliance&#x27;s right-wing tendencies quite unpleasant, which was a factor leading to the creation of an officially-neutral organization. However, as the RIN attracted many new young members it quickly became associated with more radical left-wing ideas.

In October 1960, the first general assembly of the organization published its manifesto calling for the independence of Quebec. Pierre Bourgault, who had joined shortly after foundation, became its president in 1964. Following the wish of the members, as expressed in a resolution in 1963, the RIN was turned into a political party. Bourgault and his impassioned and fiery speeches contributed largely to the popularity of the RIN, and he is often wrongly believed to be the founder of the movement.

In 1963, Georges Schoeters, Raymond Villeneuve and Gabriel Hudon, ex-members of the RIN youth wing, left the party to form the underground revolutionary Front de Libération du Québec.

In the 1966 Quebec general election, the RIN, along with the Ralliement National (RN) won about 8.8% of the popular vote and no seats. Bourgault lost the northern Duplessis riding by a very small margin, a great accomplishment for such a third party. Although it never gathered a high number of votes in Quebec, it played an important role in the birth of the modern &quot;indépendantiste&quot; movement in Quebec and was very active in public demonstrations. Famous protests of the RIN include a 1964 demonstration disapproving the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Quebec, and a 1968 protest about the presence of Pierre Trudeau on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day that turned to riot. Their members and supporters were also present in the Montreal crowd and their symbols visible when French President Charles de Gaulle shouted his famed &quot;Vive le Québec Libre&quot; (Long live free Quebec).

In October 1967, the charismatic Quebec Liberal Party Member of the National Assembly and former cabinet minister René Lévesque left his party when its members voted to not debate his idea of two independent but associated states (Quebec and Canada). Shortly afterward, the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association was founded with Lévesque as leader. The RIN quickly engaged in talks over a possible merger with the MSA. Bourgault and D&#x27;Allemagne strongly believed that the forces for Quebec independence had to unite to challenge the &quot;old parties&quot; (Liberals and Union Nationale).

Bourgault and Lévesque started to clash, as Lévesque had come to distrust the RIN because of its perceived rowdy behaviour. Additional opposition to the idea of a merger came from within the RIN itself; some militants such as Ferretti were heartbroken at the prospect of the &quot;end&quot; of their party. Ultimately, however, the desire for a strong independentist force carried the day. By 1968, the [Mouvement Souveraineté-Association had come to an agreement with the Ralliement National to form the Parti Québécois and deliberately excluded the RIN as an entity. The RIN was divided on its position towards the PQ but ended up being dissolved, some of its members joining Lévesque&#x27;s newly-created party.

<text>UNESCO Biosphere Reserves are environment-protected scientific-research institutions of international status that are created with the intent for conservation in a natural state the most typical natural complexes of biosphere, conducting background ecological monitoring, studying of the surrounding natural environment, its changes under the activity of anthropogenic factors.

Biosphere Preserves are created on the base of nature preserves or national parks including to their composition territories and objects of other categories of nature-preserving fund and other lands as well as including in the established order the World Network of Biosphere Reserves in the UNESCO framework &quot;Man and the Biosphere Programme&quot;.

The focal point in Poland for the Biosphere Reserves is the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS),
Institute of Geography and Spatial Organisation.

==Reserves==
There are currently ten such reserves in Poland, including trans-boundary reserves shared between Poland and neighboring countries.

* &quot;(Reserve POL 01)&quot; Babia Góra, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, , designated 1976, extended in 2001
The reserve is located on the border with Slovakia in the Western Beskidy Mountains. Babia Góra is the second highest massif () in Poland and forms part of the watershed boundary between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea basins. There are four environments that occur as the altitude increases. The forest belt is divided into a lower belt (up to ), consisting of forests of European beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;), silver fir (&quot;Abies alba&quot;) and Carpathian spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;), and the upper belt (up to ) consisting of Carpathian spruce forest. Above the forest is the subalpine belt (up to ) with dwarf mountain pine (&quot;Pinetum mughi&quot;) and low-growth European blueberry (&quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;). At the highest slopes is the alpine grassland belt (up to ) consisting of lichen-covered siliceous bedrock with tussock-based grasses like (&quot;Festuca supina&quot;) and (&quot;Avenella flexuosa&quot;).

* &quot;(Reserve POL 02)&quot; Białowieża Forest, Podlaskie Voivodeship, , designated 1976
The reserve, in northeastern Poland, lies adjacent to the Belovezhskaya Pushcha Biosphere Reserve in Belarus. The forest complex, the last and largest remaining mixed deciduous primeval forest on the North European Plain, is situated in the transition between the hemiboreal and continental climate areas. The forest is composed of a mosaic of diverse communities, principally composed of grey willow (&quot;Salix cinerea&quot;), European hornbeam (&quot;Carpinus betulus&quot;), arctic dwarf birch (&quot;Betula humilis&quot;) English oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;), small-leaved lime (&quot;Tilia cordata&quot;), Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;), Norway spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;), which reaches its southern limits in the northern hemisphere here, and sessile oak (&quot;Quercus petraea&quot;), which reaches its northeastern limit here.

* &quot;(Reserve POL 03)&quot; Łuknajno Lake, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, , designated 1976
The reserve is a glacial lake typical of those located in the Masurian Lake District with an area of , and a maximum depth of . The lake is connected with nearby Sniardwy Lake by a channel. The site is a breeding ground for water birds such as grebes, water rail (&quot;Rallus aquaticus&quot;), moorhen, grey heron (&quot;Ardea cinerea&quot;), bearded reedling (&quot;Panurus biarmicus&quot;), white-tailed eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;), osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;), red kite, great cormorant and black tern (&quot;Chlidonias niger&quot;). The lake has been a protected location since 1937 as a habitat of the mute swan (&quot;Cygnus olor&quot;), as every year there are a dozen to tens of dozens of nesting pairs, and during moulting they arrive in numbers reaching up to 2,000 birds.

* &quot;(Reserve POL 04)&quot; Słowiński, Pomeranian Voivodeship, , designated 1976
The reserve consists of set of dunes, brackish lakes, bogs, and wetland forests on the southern Baltic Sea coast between Łeba and Rowy, Poland. The coastal aeolian processes have produced some of the most extensive and active mobile sand dunes, which can reach high, on the Baltic Sea. Coastal erosion and other geological processes lead to the creation of sand-bars, forming brackish lakes and bogs.
The area consists of a series of vegetation zones going from the sand communities of the coastline towards the forests of the mainland. The forest includes beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;), birch (&quot;Betula pubescens&quot;), alder (&quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot;), pine and oak. It is an important way station for migrating wader birds and waterbirds such as geese, ducks and swans. The white-tailed eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;) and other birds nest at the site.

* &quot;(Reserve POL-SLO-UKR 01)&quot; East Carpathian, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in Poland, designated 1992 and extended 1998, Joint with Slovakia and Ukraine
The reserve is located in the Bieszczady Mountains on the border with Slovakia and Ukraine. There are four distinct altitude-dependent vegetation ecosystems in the mountains starting with beech forest (&quot;Fagetum sylvaticae&quot;), followed by mixed forests of beech and silver fir (&quot;Abies alba&quot;), forested areas of green alder (&quot;Alnetum viridis&quot;), and finally a belt of treeless poloniny, a subalpine meadows dominated by grasses. Over 100 species of birds live in the area such as the black stork (&quot;Ciconia nigra&quot;) and the golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;).

* &quot;(Reserve POL 05)&quot; Kampinos Forest, Masovian Voivodeship, , designated 2000
The reserve is located on the North European Plain, north-east of Warsaw, parallel to the Vistula River and is characterized by a high diversity of lowland habitats with dune belts separated by swamp areas and a mixture of forest types. The forests are principally composed of a mixture of grey willow (&quot;Salix cinerea&quot;), European hornbeam (&quot;Carpinus betulus&quot;), arctic dwarf birch (&quot;Betula humilis&quot;) English oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;), small-leaved lime (&quot;Tilia cordata&quot;) and Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;).

* &quot;(Reserve CZE-POL 01)&quot; Karkonosze, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in Poland, designated 1992, Joint with Slovakia
The reserve is part of the Western Sudetes mountains stretching from south-central Poland along the northern border of the Czech Republic to eastern Germany. The mountains are located at the watershed dividing the Baltic Sea and North Sea basins. The area is known for its high biodiversity in four altitudinal vegetation belts, from submontane to alpine. The river valleys and lower layers form the sub-montane zone made up of forests of European beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;), silver fir (&quot;Abies alba&quot;) and Carpathian spruce (&quot;Picea Abies&quot;). The higher parts form the montane vegetation zone characterized by forested areas of Carpathian spruce (&quot;Picea Abies&quot;). Above is the subalpine zone, which is marked by dwarf mountain pine (&quot;Pinus mugo&quot;), mat-grass meadows and subarctic high moors. There are three subalpine bogs that support an extensive algal community important for migratory birds and raptors. The alpine vegetation zone, is characterized by large rocky deserts with herbaceous perennials such as &quot;Carici (rigidae)-Nardetum&quot; and &quot;Festucetum supinae&quot;.

* &quot;(Reserve POL-SLO 01)&quot; Tatra Mountains, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in Poland, designated 1992, Joint with Slovakia
The reserve covers areas on each side of the border between Poland and Slovakia. The area contains a number of natural features such as a dwarf pine belt, alpine meadows, lakes and rocky peaks. The area consists of temperate broadleaf forests or woodlands made up of mixed beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;) forest with fir (&quot;Abies alba&quot;) and sycamore (&quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot;). Higher up in the mountains this transitions to forests of silver fir (&quot;Abies alba&quot;) and Carpathian spruce (&quot;Picea Abies&quot;) until the timber line (). Above the forest is the subalpine zone () with dwarf mountain pine (&quot;Pinetum mughi&quot;), &quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot; and &quot;Betula carpatica&quot;. The alpine zone consists of grasses and low-growth herbaceous groundcover.

* West Polesie, Lublin Voivodeship, in Poland, designated 2002 and extended 2012, Joint with Belarus and Ukraine
The reserve comprises a vast open lowland landscape with a mosaic of swamps, moors, lakes, rivers and forests located between the basins of the Bug and Wieprz rivers. The site is part of the European Ecological Corridor of the Bug River. The location supports bird species including raptors such as lesser spotted eagle (&quot;Aquila pomarina&quot;), hen harrier (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;) and Montagu&#x27;s harrier (&quot;Circus pygargus&quot;) and birds such as aquatic warbler (&quot;Acrocephalus paludicola&quot;), marsh sandpiper (&quot;Tringa stagnatilis&quot;) and Eurasian cranes (&quot;Grus grus&quot;). The area is considered to be an important crossing point for migratory birds. The north-south flyways and east-west flyways of birds meet in the region. The areas consists of boreal Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;) forests, black alder (&quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot;) wetland forests, meadows and peatbog (raised bog, transitional bog and fen) ecosystems.

* &quot;(Reserve POL 07)&quot; Tuchola Forest, Pomeranian Voivodeship, , designated 2010
The reserve covers one of the largest forests in Poland, containing mainly Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;). The landforms of the area were sculpted by a glacier that retreated at the end of the last glacial age creating characteristically long ribbon lakes. Additionally there are large clusters of inland sand dunes. There are extensive areas of peat bogs formed as a result of the overgrowing of the shallower lakes. A number of species of birds live in the area such as the black stork (&quot;Ciconia nigra&quot;), black grouse (&quot;Tetrao tetrix&quot;), wood grouse (&quot;Tetrao urogallus&quot;) and peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;).

<doc id="429555" wikidata="Q17152488" url="?curid=429555" title="Paper wasp">
<text>Paper wasps are a type of vespid wasps. The term is typically used to refer to members of the vespid subfamily Polistinae, though it often colloquially includes members of the subfamilies Vespinae (hornets and yellowjackets) and Stenogastrinae, which also make nests out of paper.

Paper wasp nests are characterized by open combs with down pointing cells. Some types of paper wasps are occasionally referred to as umbrella wasps due to the distinctive design of their nests.

== Species ==
Approximately 300 species of &quot;Polistes&quot; paper wasps have been identified worldwide. The most common paper wasp in Europe is &quot;Polistes dominula&quot;. The Old World tribe Ropalidiini contains another 300 species, and the Neotropical tribes Epiponini and Mischocyttarini each contain over 250 more, so the total number of true paper wasps worldwide is about 1100 species, almost half of which can be found in the neotropics.

== Nests ==
The nests of most true paper wasps are characterized by having open combs with cells for brood rearing. The wasps gather fibers from dead wood and plant stems, which they mix with saliva, and use to construct nests that appear made out of gray or brown papery material. A &#x27;petiole&#x27;, or constricted stalk attaches the nest to a branch or other structure. 
The wasps secrete an ant repellent chemical which they spread around the base of the petiole or anchor to prevent the loss of eggs or brood.
Most social wasps of the family Vespidae make nests from paper, but some stenogastrine species, such as &quot;Liostenogaster flavolineata&quot;, use mud. A small group of eusocial crabronid wasps, of the genus &quot;Microstigmus&quot; (the only eusocial wasps outside the family Vespidae), also constructs nests out of chewed plant fibers, though the nest consistency is quite different from those of true paper wasps, due to the absence of wood fibers, and the use of silk extruded by female wasps to bind the fibers.

Nests can be found in sheltered areas, such as the eaves of a house, the branches of a tree, on the end of an open pipe, or on an old clothesline. Some species, such as &quot;Ropalidia romandi&quot;, will vary their nest architecture depending on where they build their nest.

Three species of &quot;Polistes&quot; are obligate social parasites, and have lost the ability to build their own nests, and are sometimes referred to as &quot;cuckoo paper wasps&quot;. They rely on the nests of their hosts to raise their brood. A few hornets and yellowjackets are also brood parasites (e.g., &quot;Vespula austriaca&quot;).

== Brood rearing ==
In temperate climates, in the fall, reproductive males and females are reared. They fly away and mate. Only the new queens hibernate overwinter in a sheltered location.
In the spring each searches for a suitable location and starts and maintains a new nest typically by herself until the first brood of female workers matures and helps in all activities except egg laying.


Once eggs hatch, the legless larvae remain in their cells to be taken care of. The wasps hunt prey, primarily caterpillars, but also other insects like flies, and beetle larvae. The adult cuts up the prey and masticates it (thoroughly chewing it) prior to feeding it to the larvae.
Water is also provided for the larva. Wasps may find a puddle or stream or dew that has collected at the base of some leaves.
When the larvae mature, they pupate in their cell and the workers cap the cell, sealing them in until the adult breaks out of its pupal shell.
The open nest is light colored reflecting light and the nest material provides some insulation, even so it can be subjected to elevated temperatures with sun exposure or high ambient temperatures. The wasps can cool their nest by fanning their wings and/or bringing water to place in the nest letting evaporation provide substantial cooling.

== Behavior ==
Unlike yellowjackets and hornets, which can be very aggressive, polistine paper wasps will generally only attack if they themselves or their nest are threatened. Their territoriality can lead to attacks on people, and their stings are quite painful and – like all venomous animals – can produce a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction in some individuals. A study conducted on European paper wasps (&quot;Polistes dominula&quot;) concluded that wasps with brighter aposematic colors are more venomous, because they have larger venom glands, and offer a stronger warning signal to organisms threatening the nest.


Most wasps are beneficial in their natural habitat and are critically important in natural biocontrol. Paper wasps feed on sugars like nectar, aphid honeydew and the sugary liquid produced by their larvae. Because they are a known pollinator and feed on known garden pests, paper wasps are often considered to be beneficial by gardeners.

When threatened, the wasps have a variety of responses depending upon the severity. Paper wasps use alarm pheromones to coordinate their response. The first level is posturing. They face the perceived threat, stand tall and raise their wings.

At a higher level of threat, the wasp will move around the nest surface. With sufficient disturbance, the wasp will fly around the nest attempting to locate the source, chasing and stinging the threat.

<doc id="429559" wikidata="Q2321680" url="?curid=429559" title="Tashkent Declaration">
<text>The Tashkent Declaration was signed between India and Pakistan on 10 January 1966 to resolve the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Peace was achieved on 23 September through interventions by the Soviet Union and the United States, both of which pushed the two warring countries towards a ceasefire in an attempt to avoid any escalation that could draw in other powers.

==Background==
The meeting was hosted by the Soviet Union in the city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, from 4 to 10 January 1966 in an attempt to create a more permanent settlement between the warring sides.

The Soviets, represented by Soviet politician Aleksei Kosygin, moderated between Indian prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani president Muhammad Ayub Khan.

==Declaration==
A declaration was released that was hoped to be a framework for lasting peace by stating that the Indian military and the Pakistani military would pull back to their pre-conflict positions, their pre-August lines, no later than 25 February 1966; neither nation would interfere in each other&#x27;s internal affairs; economic and diplomatic relations would be restored; there would be an orderly transfer of prisoners of war, and both leaders would work towards improving bilateral relations.

==Aftermath==
The treaty was heavily criticized in both countries, as Indians and Pakistanis were expecting more concessions to their respective sides than what had been agreed upon. In accordance with the Tashkent Declaration, talks were held at the ministerial level on 1 and 2 March 1966. Despite the fact that these talks were unproductive, the diplomatic exchange continued throughout the spring and summer, though stark differences of opinion on the Kashmir conflict culminated in the lack of a resolution from bilateral discussions.

In India, the agreement was criticized because it did not contain a no-war pact or any renunciation of guerrilla warfare across Kashmir. After the Tashkent Declaration was signed, Indian prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri died under mysterious circumstances in Tashkent; his sudden death led to the rise of conspiracy theories claiming that he was poisoned. Journalist, conspiracy theorist, and holocaust denier Gregory Douglas claimed he conducted a series of interviews with American intelligence officer Robert Crowley in 1993. According to Douglas, Crowley claimed that the Central Intelligence Agency assassinated Shastri as well as Indian nuclear scientist Homi J. Bhabha (who died on Air India Flight 101) in order to thwart the development of India&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme. The Indian government has refused to declassify a report on his death under the claim that it would harm India&#x27;s foreign relations, cause disruption in the country, and breach parliamentary privileges.

In Pakistan, the agreement caused widespread distress; social upset was exacerbated after Pakistani president Muhammad Ayub Khan went into seclusion in the ceasefire&#x27;s aftermath, as demonstrations and riots erupted across the country. However, Khan later addressed the nation on 14 January 1966 and explained the rationale behind the agreement. Although he was eventually able to quell the unrest, the Tashkent Declaration greatly damaged Khan&#x27;s image, and was one of the factors that ultimately led to his downfall in 1969.

<text>Babia Góra (in Polish), or Babia hora (in Slovak) is a massif situated on the border between Poland and Slovakia in the Western Beskid Mountains. The name is also applied to the culmination of the massif, Diablak (&quot;Devil&#x27;s Peak&quot;), which is also the highest peak of this part of the Carpathian Mountains, at above sea level.

==History==
The first historical mentions of the massif date back to the 15th century, when it first mentioned in the writings of Jan Długosz. It was only in the 19th century that the area was explored and chronicled in greater depth, with the first known mountain hut constructed in 1905.

==Nature==
Gentle from the south, steep from the north, Babia Góra is home to bear, lynx, wolf and other species; as well as alpine flora endemic at this altitude. The first attempts to protect the area were made in the 1930s. In 1933 the Nature Reserve of Babia Góra was established on the Polish side. Later, in 1954, Babia Góra National Park (&quot;Babiogórski Park Narodowy&quot;) was established with an area of 17.04 km2. In 1976 it became one of the first Biosphere Reserves in the world. For a long time Babia Góra National Park was the smallest of the Polish national parks. In 1997 it was enlarged to 33.92 km2 and a buffer zone was created of 84.37 km2. Within the park, 10.62 km2 is under strict protection. There are calls for strengthening of cross-border cooperation with Slovakia to better protect the fragile environment of the mountain.

== Climate==
Babia Góra is sometimes nicknamed Matka Niepogód (Mother of Bad Weather). It is very susceptible to weather changes primarily due to the frequent winds that regularly hit the area. The mountain also experiences a strong inversion. Snow can cover the massif for over 200 days every year. In May 2016, a climber was killed by lightning while attempting to descend the mountain when a thunderstorm approached.

==Hiking and skiing==
Although generally relatively easy to hike, Babia Góra can be reached by a more difficult yellow route called Perć Akademików (Academics&#x27; Path). Today, despite (or perhaps because of) steep climbs, chains and metal steps fixed to the rocks along sections of the trail, it is very popular with hikers.

The whole Babia Góra National Park is a strict nature reserve: skitouring, for example, was only permitted from 2022 onwards and only if certain weather and snow conditions were met.

<text>Shepshed (often known until 1888 as &quot;Sheepshed&quot;, also &quot;Sheepshead&quot; – a name derived from the village being heavily involved in the wool industry) is a market town and civil parish in the Charnwood Borough of Leicestershire, England with a population of 14,875 at the 2021 census. It is the third largest settlement in the borough, after Loughborough and Leicester.

==History==

===Origins===
The town originally grew as a centre for the wool trade. There has been controversy about the origin of the name of the town. The earliest form is &quot;Scepeshefde Regis&quot; as mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, which means &quot;(King&#x27;s) hill where sheep graze&quot;, but since then there have been many changes until the present form, Shepshed, was adopted in 1888. The addition of the suffix &#x27;Regis&#x27; signifies that there was once a royal lodge in the area.

Very little information about the settlement on the site of Shepshed appears before the Domesday Book but the name is certainly Anglo-Saxon: local history books claim that Shepshed has two of the oldest roads in the country, Ring Fence and Sullington Road, the latter being an ancient British track named after the goddess Solina. Anglo-Saxon Shepshed cannot have been much more than a hamlet in a large district of forest. However, succeeding centuries provide an abundance of historical material. The prosperity of medieval Shepshed was based on the wool industry and &quot;Well Yard&quot; on Forest Street may well be a corruption of &quot;Wool Yard&quot;, where Bradford wool merchants congregated to buy from local inhabitants. In addition, there is considerable evidence to suggest that a weekly market was held, at least until the 14th century.

===Parish Church of St Botolph===

The 11th century Parish church of St Botolph (the westernmost parish church in England to bear the name) and its land the Oakley Wood was originally given to Odo of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror, after the Norman conquest in 1066. The ownership of the estate reverted to the Crown a number of times including in 1534. A wood carving exists in the church depicting a visit of Queen Elizabeth I though it is at present unclear if the Queen ever came to Shepshed itself, but if she did, it would have been the farthest north that she travelled in the country. The older part of the town is still centred on the church.

The church&#x27;s original patronage came from Leicester Abbey. Between 1699 and 1856, however, the patrons were the Phillips family of Garendon Hall. This family has been Lords of the Manor since its purchase by Sir Ambrose Phillips (1637–1691) in 1683. Garendon Hall (demolished 1964) was built on the site of Garendon Abbey, a prominent Cistercian house which was founded in 1133 by Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester and survived until its dissolution by Henry VIII in 1536. Garendon Abbey, whose economy was largely based on sheep farming, was one of the most important possessor of granges in Leicestershire.

===18th to 20th centuries===
The 18th century saw the enclosure of the common lands around Shepshed. There had been enclosures in the 15th and 16th centuries, but towards the end of the 18th century the last remaining common land, approximately 2,000 acres (8 km2), was enclosed and divided among the principal commoners of the village. 

Shepshed experienced an &#x27;earthquake&#x27; on 30 September 1750. The vicar of St. Botolph&#x27;s church at the time, the reverend Thomas Heath, recorded in the parish registers: &quot;Sept 30, 1750, this day (Sunday), while I was administering the Sacrament, between the hours of 12 and 1 o’clock, I and the congregation were very terrible of the shock of an earthquake.&quot;

Much destruction was caused in the town when, on 30 June 1753, 85 bays of buildings were destroyed by fire which had happened at what is now known as Hall Croft, named after the school which had been burnt down in the fire.

There were many changes during the 19th century. Shepshed was briefly linked by canal to Loughborough, and to the coalmines of West Leicestershire when the Charnwood Forest Canal was opened in 1798, but success was only short lived. The following year, the dam at Blackbrook Reservoir, to the south of Shepshed, part of the ill-fated canal scheme, collapsed, causing widespread flooding in Shepshed and Loughborough. By 1804 the canal had proved an uneconomic venture and was abandoned, though modern roads and footpaths still follow the course it took through Shepshed. The Charnwood Forest Railway (nicknamed the Bluebell Line on account of the proliferation of the flower) was opened in 1883, but regular passenger services ceased in 1931. However, the goods service did not close until 1963. Shepshed railway station no longer stands though part of the old line forms a bridleway between the town and Thringstone including the now redundant viaduct at Grace Dieu.

==Education==
The main school was previously Hind Leys Community College which educated pupils from 14 to 19, in the town, and included pupils not only from Shepshed, but also from local towns and villages such as Loughborough, Kegworth, Belton, Castle Donington, Diseworth, Long Whatton and Tonge. This school then combined with Shepshed High School to become the new Iveshead School which educates ages 11-19 from the same areas as the previous Hind Leys Community College. There are four primary schools in the town, and three of these feed into Iveshead; Oxley, St Botolph&#x27;s (Recently Demolished) and Newcroft. The final primary school, St Winefride&#x27;s, caters for Roman Catholic pupils until the age of 11, after which most of them transfer to De Lisle College 11–19 school in Loughborough. Newcroft Primary School became Newcroft Primary Academy in 2016.

==Transport==
Shepshed is located close to junction 23 of the M1 motorway. The nearest railway station is Loughborough railway station, and East Midlands Airport is seven miles away.

=== Buses ===

Shepshed is serviced by Arriva Midlands services 16/16A and 127 with frequent buses into Loughborough and Coalville, and Diamond East Midlands&#x27; route 129 between Loughborough and Ashby.The skylink Nottingham operated by trentbarton also links the village with East Midlands Airport and Nottingham.

==Sport==
The town is represented in the Northern Premier League by Shepshed Dynamo F.C., who play at the Dovecote Stadium. Ingles F.C. (formed in 1972) also have two football teams. The first team ground shares with Shepshed Dynamo at the Dovecote stadium while the reserves are based at Little Haw Lane. The club has progressed rapidly since 2013 with back to back promotions and now the first team currently play in the Midland League Division One with the reserves in the Leicestershire Senior League.

Shepshed Cricket Club was formed in 2015 from the merger of the towns 2 existing cricket teams; Shepshed Town and Shepshed Messengers. 
Shepshed Town was established in 1869 and in recent years has been ranked among the top clubs in Leicestershire. Following the merger, the club will field 4 senior sides as well as Under 15, Under 13 and Under 11 sides.

The major Rugby side in the town is Shepshed RFC. who train and play on the Hind Leys Campus. Founded in 1985, they won the LRU Division 4 in 2014 and the LRU Division 3 in 2015.

==Notable People==
* Bruce Woolley – Musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer, lived in Shepshed.
* Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall – Footballer, grew up in Shepshed.

==Shepshed Fire Station==
Shepshed has a retained fire station, part of Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service (LFRS), serving the town from the fire station on Charnwood Road. The station, which opened in 2002, replaced the previous station built on the same site in 1951 and was initially opened as a combined police and fire station. The police station was quickly downgraded to an office and then withdrawn completely, leaving Shepshed without a police station for the first time in many decades. LFRS took over the entire building and now operate a training centre alongside the retained station. In front of the station is a memorial to two Shepshed police officers who were murdered in the line of duty in 2002 and two long-serving firefighters, one of whom died en route to a fire call in 2006.

The station operates a Scania pumping appliance and a Command Support Vehicle.

<doc id="429572" wikidata="Q498791" url="?curid=429572" title="Gwanggaeto the Great">
<text>Gwanggaeto the Great (374–412, r. 391–412) was the nineteenth monarch of Goguryeo. His full posthumous name means &quot;Entombed in &quot;Gukgangsang&quot;, Broad Expander of Domain, Peacemaker, Supreme King&quot;, sometimes abbreviated to &quot;Hotaewang&quot;. His era name is &quot;Yeongnak&quot; and he is occasionally recorded as &quot;Yeongnak Taewang&quot; (&quot;&quot;Great King&quot; or &quot;Emperor&quot; Yeongnak&quot;). Gwanggaeto&#x27;s imperial reign title meant that Goguryeo was on equal standing as an empire with the imperial dynasties in China.

Under Gwanggaeto, Goguryeo began a golden age, becoming a powerful empire and one of the great powers in East Asia. Gwanggaeto made enormous advances and conquests into: Western Manchuria against Khitan tribes; Inner Mongolia and the Maritime Province of Russia against numerous nations and tribes; and the Han River valley in central Korea to control over two-thirds of the Korean peninsula.

In regard to the Korean Peninsula, Gwanggaeto defeated Baekje, the then most powerful of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, in 396, capturing the capital city of Wiryeseong in present-day Seoul. In 399, Silla, the southeastern kingdom of Korea, sought aid from Goguryeo due to incursions by Baekje troops and their Wa allies from the Japanese archipelago. Gwanggaeto dispatched 50,000 expeditionary troops, crushing his enemies and securing Silla as a de facto protectorate; he thus subdued the other Korean kingdoms and achieved a loose unification of the Korean peninsula under Goguryeo. In his western campaigns, he defeated the Xianbei of the Later Yan empire and conquered the Liaodong peninsula, regaining the ancient domain of Gojoseon.

Gwanggaeto&#x27;s accomplishments are recorded on the Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in 414 at the supposed site of his tomb in Ji&#x27;an along the present-day China–North Korea border. Constructed by his son and successor Jangsu, the monument to Gwanggaeto the Great is the largest engraved stele in the world.

==Family==
*Father: King Gogukyang ()
**Grandfather: King Gogukwon ()
*Unknown wife
**Son: Prince Georyeon ()
**Unknown son; father of Go Seung-cheon ().

==Birth and background==
At the time of Gwanggaeto&#x27;s birth, Goguryeo was not as powerful as it once had been. In 371, three years prior to Gwanggaeto&#x27;s birth, the rival Korean kingdom of Baekje, under the great leadership of Geunchogo, soundly defeated Goguryeo, slaying the monarch Gogukwon and sacking Pyongyang. Baekje became one of the dominant powers in East Asia. Baekje&#x27;s influence was not limited to the Korean peninsula, but extended across the sea to Liaoxi and Shandong in China, taking advantage of the weakened state of Former Qin, and Kyushu in the Japanese archipelago. Goguryeo was inclined to avoid conflicts with its ominous neighbor, while cultivating constructive relations with the Former Qin, the Xianbei, and the Rouran, in order to defend itself from future invasions and to bide time to reshape its legal structure and to initiate military reforms.

Gogukwon&#x27;s successor, Sosurim, adopted a foreign policy of appeasement and reconciliation with Baekje, and concentrated on domestic policies to spread Buddhism throughout Goguryeo&#x27;s social and political systems. 
Furthermore, due to the defeats that Goguryeo had suffered at the hands of Baekje as well as the proto-Mongol Xianbei, Sosurim instituted military reforms aimed at preventing such defeats in the future. Sosurim&#x27;s internal arrangements laid the groundwork for Gwanggaeto&#x27;s expansion.

Sosurim&#x27;s successor, Gogukyang, invaded Later Yan, the successor state of Former Yan, in 385 and Baekje in 386.

==Reign==
===Rise to power and campaigns against Baekje===

Gwanggaeto succeeded his father, Gogukyang, upon Gogukyang&#x27;s death in 391. Upon Gwanggaeto&#x27;s coronation, Gwanggaeto adopted the era name &quot;Yeongnak&quot; (Eternal Rejoicing) and the title &quot;Taewang&quot; (Supreme King), which was equivalent to &quot;emperor&quot;, affirming that he was an equal to the Imperial rulers of China.

In 392, Gwanggaeto led an attack on Baekje with 40,000 troops, capturing 10 walled cities. In response, Asin, the monarch of Baekje, launched a counterattack on Goguryeo in 393 but was defeated. Despite the ongoing war, during 393, Gwanggaeto established 9 Buddhist temples in Pyongyang. Asin invaded Goguryeo once more in 394, but was defeated again. After suffering multiple defeats against Goguryeo, Baekje&#x27;s political stability began to crumble. In 395, Baekje was defeated once more by Goguryeo and was pushed south to its capital of Wiryeseong on the Han River. In the following year, in 396, Gwanggaeto led an assault on Wiryeseong by land and sea, using the Han River, and triumphed over Baekje. Gwanggaeto captured the Baekje capital and the defeated Asin submitted to him, surrendering a prince and 10 government ministers.

===Northern conquests===
In 395, while his campaign against Baekje was ongoing to the south, Gwanggaeto made an excursion to invade the Khitan Baili clan to the west on the Liao River, destroying 3 tribes and 600 to 700 camps. In 398, Gwanggaeto conquered the Sushen people to the northeast, who were Tungusic ancestors of the Jurchens and Manchus.

In 400, while Gwanggaeto was occupied with Baekje, Gaya, and Wa troops in Silla, the Xianbei state of Later Yan, founded by the Murong clan in present-day Liaoning, attacked Goguryeo. Gwanggaeto repulsed the Xianbei troops. In 402, Gwanggaeto retaliated and conquered the prominent fortress called 宿軍城 near the capital of Later Yan. In 405 and again in 406, Later Yan troops attacked Goguryeo fortresses in Liaodong (遼東城 in 405, and 木底城 in 406), but were defeated both times. Gwanggaeto conquered all of Liaodong. By conquering Liaodong, Gwanggaeto recovered the ancient domain of Gojoseon; Goguryeo controlled Liaodong until the mid-late 7th century.

In 407, Gwanggaeto dispatched 50,000 troops consisting of infantry and cavalry and won a great victory, completely annihilating the enemy troops and pillaging about 10,000 armors and countless war supplies; the opponent can be interpreted as Later Yan, Baekje, or Wa.

In 410, Gwanggaeto attacked Eastern Buyeo to the northeast.

===Southern campaigns===
In 400, Silla, another Korean kingdom in the southeast of the Korean peninsula, requested aid from Goguryeo in repelling an allied invasion by Baekje, Gaya, and Wa. Gwanggaeto dispatched 50,000 troops and annihilated the enemy coalition. Thereupon, Gwanggaeto influenced Silla as a suzerain, and Gaya declined and never recovered. In 402, Gwanggaeto returned Prince Silseong, who had resided in Goguryeo as a political hostage since 392, back home to Silla and appointed him as the king of Silla.

In 404, Gwanggaeto defeated an attack by the Wa from the Japanese archipelago on the southern border of what was once the Daifang commandery, inflicting enormous casualties on the enemy.

==Death and legacy==
Gwanggaeto died of an unknown illness in 412 at the age of 38. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Jangsu, who ruled Goguryeo for 79 years until the age of 97, the longest reign in East Asian history.

Gwanggaeto&#x27;s conquests are said to mark the zenith of Korean history, building and consolidating a great empire in Northeast Asia and uniting the Three Kingdoms of Korea under his influence. Gwanggaeto conquered 64 walled cities and 1,400 villages. Except for the period of 200 years beginning with Jangsu, who would build upon his father&#x27;s domain, and the golden age of Balhae, Korea never before or since ruled such a vast territory. There is archaeological evidence that Goguryeo&#x27;s maximum extent lay even further west in present-day Mongolia, based on discoveries of Goguryeo fortress ruins in Mongolia. Gwanggaeto established his own era name, &quot;Yeongnak Eternal Rejoicing&quot;, proclaiming Goguryeo monarchs equal to their counterparts in the Chinese mainland.

Gwanggaeto the Great is one of two rulers of Korea whose names are appended with the title &quot;the Great&quot;, with the other being Sejong the Great of Joseon, who created Hangul the Korean alphabet, to promote literacy among the common people, and made great advances in science.

Gwanggaeto is regarded by Koreans as one of the greatest heroes in Korean history, and is often taken as a potent symbol of Korean nationalism.

The Gwanggaeto Stele, a 6.39 meter tall monument erected by Jangsu in 414, was rediscovered in the late 19th century. The stele was inscribed with information about Gwanggaeto&#x27;s reign and achievements, but not all the characters and passages have been preserved. Korean and Japanese scholars disagree on the interpretation in regard to passages on the Wa.

The Republic of Korea Navy operates Gwanggaeto the Great-class destroyers, built by Daewoo Heavy Industries and named in honor of the monarch.

A prominent statue of Gwanggaeto alongside a replica of the Gwanggaeto Stele were erected in the main street of Guri in Gyeonggi Province.

<doc id="429574" wikidata="Q94460" url="?curid=429574" title="Grand Theft Auto 2">
<text>Grand Theft Auto 2 is an action-adventure game developed by DMA Design and published by Rockstar Games in October 1999 for the PlayStation and Windows, and the Dreamcast and Game Boy Color in 2000. It is the sequel to 1997&#x27;s &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, and the second main entry in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series. Set within a retrofuturistic metropolis known as &quot;Anywhere City&quot;, the game focuses on players taking the role of a criminal as they roam an open world, conducting jobs for various crime syndicates and having free rein to do whatever they wish to achieve their goal. The game&#x27;s intro is unique for a title in the series, as it involved live-action scenes filmed by Rockstar Games.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; received mixed reviews for most platforms, and negative reviews for the Game Boy Color, but was a moderate commercial success. While the soundtrack and some gameplay elements, such as the gang loyalty system, were praised, the graphics, controls, and setting received a more mixed game response. The game was also criticised for failing to innovate the formula established by its predecessor, despite several improvements it brought. &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; was followed by 2001&#x27;s &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, which started a new era for the series, while the game itself was re-released on Steam in January 2008.

==Gameplay==

Players begin a game with only one character—six in the Game Boy Color version. Like its predecessor &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, the game focuses on players completing a series of levels, each requiring a set target score being achieved to progress to the next stage. Points are awarded from various criminal actions such as destroying cars, selling vehicles, and completing missions for various crime syndicates, with the latter awarding more points than doing simple criminal actions. Creating chaos from their crimes will cause the player to be wanted by the police who will hound the player to arrest or kill them, with higher wanted levels increasing the level of response used. Being arrested or dying loses the player any equipment they found, and impacts their multiplier bonus.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot;″s setting is unique for the series: a retrofuturistic metropolis referred to as &quot;Anywhere, USA&quot;, which is divided into three districts (Downtown, Residential, and Industrial) that players will switch between as they progress through the game. The time period the game is set in is not specified—conflicting sources suggest anything from &quot;three weeks into the future&quot;, to the year being 2013, despite in-game references to the &quot;new millenium&quot; that is coming (implying the game takes place around its time of release, in 1999).

The game introduced several features and improvements to the series. Players can save their game during a playthrough of a level by visiting the church they start at, but must pay a set number of points to do so. Jobs on offer come from three different syndicates—each level features two unique syndicates, alongside a third syndicate present in all levels. By doing jobs for a syndicate and successfully completing them, the player gains respect with that syndicate, allowing them to take on tougher jobs with enough respect, but lose it with their chief rivals, locking them out of their jobs and making the syndicate&#x27;s members hostile to the player. Other improvements include vehicles and pedestrians being more interactive with the game&#x27;s environment—such as gang members engaging in fights with police—the presence of other criminals (such as muggers), a health meter, garages that can modify vehicles with special improvements, a selection of side missions ranging from running a taxi to driving a semi-truck, and groups of &#x27;hidden&#x27; packages to find across the level.

== Development ==
&quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; was developed by DMA Design in Dundee under the lead programmer Keith Hamilton. The team initially intended to call the game &quot;Eh Stole E&#x27; Motur&quot; but later believed this name could hamper the game&#x27;s international appeal.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; was released for the PlayStation and Windows on 22 October 1999. More than 1.2 million copies of the game were shipped to retailers worldwide upon release, expected to contribute over in gross revenue. It was released for the Dreamcast on 1 May 2000 in North America and 20 May in Europe. A Game Boy Color version, developed by Tarantula Studios, was released in December 2000.

==&quot;GTA 2 – The Movie&quot;==
The game was developed with an eight-minute short film of live-action footage, filmed within New York City. The short film was devised as an introductory sequence for the game, and was made available on Rockstar Games&#x27;s website. The film follows a criminal named Claude Speed (played by Scott Maslen), who conducts jobs around Anywhere City for several criminal syndicates, until his actions eventually catch up and he is killed by an assassin from one of the gangs he robbed. The film was based on a screenplay by Dan Houser, and directed by Alex De Rakoff.

==Soundtrack==
Each area features five radio stations from a pool of eleven, one of which is heard as the player drives most vehicles in-game. Changing radio stations for preference is possible. &quot;Head Radio&quot; was present in the original &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories&quot;. Each gang has its own radio station that transmits within a limited area. Police vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks and tanks had no ability to listen to the radio channels. Instead, the player would hear the radio transmitter of the emergency services.

All the music and the ads included in the game are exclusive, following the tradition of previous games. People in charge of the musical content were Craig Conner, Stuart Ross, Paul Scargill, Colin Anderson, Bert Reid and Moving Shadow. Some of these producers would keep their work on subsequent &quot;GTA&quot; releases.

The Game Boy Color version uses some real songs, one of which is a sped up version of &quot;Back in Black&quot; by AC/DC. The Character Selection theme is an old Brazilian song titled &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot;″s computer version received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The game&#x27;s PlayStation version received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award (300,000 or more units in the United Kingdom) from ELSPA.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; was released to mixed reviews. The game&#x27;s graphics received mixed reactions from critics, who noted that they had barely any difference to the graphics in the original game. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Tal Blevins called them &quot;average at best&quot;, and that the scenery is &quot;hard to appreciate&quot;. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that the &quot;graphics look a bit plain.&quot; The game&#x27;s soundtrack received positive feedback, with Gerstmann calling it a &quot;great soundtrack&quot;, and that it &quot;closely [mirrors] the station-style of the original game&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Blevins called it &quot;one of the best features&quot; of the game.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot;″s gameplay elements received mixed reactions. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jeremy Dunham said that the gameplay is &quot;where the game really takes a punch to the stomach&quot;, and that it &quot;could&#x27;ve been a lot better.&quot; Tal Blevins called it &quot;simple, but effective.&quot; Jeff Gerstmann said that &quot;even though the gameplay is largely the same as in the previous &quot;GTA&quot;, it&#x27;s still a lot of fun.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; highlighted the game&#x27;s story development and inventive missions, stating that &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; &quot;manages to draw you deep into the complexities of its world&quot;.

Blake Fischer reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that it is &quot;A great idea that, for one reason or another, never really gets into a must-play game.&quot;

The Game Boy Color version received negative reviews. Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; wrote, &quot;I appreciate the desire to try and move games from the higher platforms to the Game Boy Color, but jeez, &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot;? The first one was bad enough. I will take this time to plead with Rockstar Games - just say no to &quot;GTA&quot; on GBA.&quot;

<text>The Russian United Democratic Party Yabloko (RUDP Yabloko; , ) is a social-liberal political party in Russia. The party consequently participated in the elections of deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of all eight convocations. Until 2003, Yabloko was represented by a faction in the State Duma and later until 2007 by individual deputies. In March 2002, the party became a full member of the Liberal International, and since November 1998, it has been in observer status. The founder of the party Grigory Yavlinsky is an honorary vice-president of the Liberal International and winner of its Prize for Freedom. Since 2006, Yabloko has been a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). As of 2021, the party was represented by factions in 4 regional parliaments of the Russian Federation. In addition, members of the party were deputies of 13 administrative centers of the subjects of the Russian Federation, 183 representatives of the party were municipal deputies in Moscow and 84 in Saint Petersburg.

The party also advocates for the protection of the rights of LGBT people in Russia.

== History ==
The party dates back to the early 1990s. Originally established as a public organization in 1993, it transformed into a political party in 2001. From 1993–2003, the party had a small faction in the State Duma; in 2003, four single-mandate deputies passed from Yabloko to the Duma: one of them joined United Russia, and three joined the informal group of independent democrats. After the tightening of Russian legislation in 2011, only 7 registered political parties remained in Russia, among which was Yabloko. In 2011, the party managed to obtain the right to state funding, which allowed further functioning of the organization. As a result of the 2016 elections, the party is not receiving any state funding any further.

=== Emergence of the Party (1993–2002) ===
The immediate predecessor of the Yabloko party was the electoral bloc Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin, formed for the legislative elections of 1993. &quot;Yabloko&quot; is an acronym of the names of its founders: &quot;Я&quot; (Ya) for Grigory Yavlinsky; &quot;Б&quot; (B) for Yury Boldyrev, and &quot;Л&quot; (L) for Vladimir Lukin, with the full name meaning &quot;Apple&quot; in Russian.

The bloc included several political parties: the Republican, the Social Democratic, and the Russian Christian Democratic Union – New Democracy. The Yabloko bloc in the 1993 elections received 7.86% of the vote, as a result of which the Yabloko faction was created in the State Duma In January 1995 Yabloko was transformed into a public association after holding a founding congress. Yavlinsky became the head of the central council. Already during this period, there were some changes in the leadership. In 1994 part of the representatives of the Republican Party, headed by Vladimir Lysenko, left the bloc. At the same time, the Regional Center Party from St. Petersburg joined Yabloko as a regional organization. In September 1995, due to disagreements on some fundamental issues, Yury Boldyrev left the association as well.

The Yabloko public association was able to form factions based on the results of the elections to the State Duma in 1995 and 1999. In 1995, in the elections to the State Duma of the 2nd convocation, the Yabloko association received 6.89% of the vote. In the elections of the State Duma of the III convocation in 1999 Yabloko association made an alliance with Sergei Stepashin, including him as number three of the party list. According to the results of the vote count, the party received 5.93% of the votes.

Yabloko during the entire period of President Yeltsin became the &quot;democratic opposition&quot; to the president&#x27;s policies. For example, Yabloko opposed privatization conducted by Anatoly Chubais, and offered an alternative program in 1998, which stated that privatization was carried out in an economically senseless and socially detrimental way, passing control of sold organizations to the “directors” with several backdrop nominal owners.

During the 1996 elections, Yavlinsky was offered to join the government. As a condition to join Yabloko&#x27;s leader demanded an end to hostilities in Chechnya and to make serious adjustments to the socio-economic policy. In addition, he demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Security Service of the President of the Russian Federation Alexander Korzhakov, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, head of the presidential administration Nikolai Yegorov, director of the FSS Mikhail Barsukov. Since these conditions were not accepted, Yavlinsky and his team did not enter the government.

Some members of the Yabloko faction nevertheless accepted the proposals of the executive branch. Mikhail Zadornov and Oksana Dmitrieva became members of the government, for which they were expelled from the party. Also, Ivan Grachev and Vyacheslav Igrunov left Yabloko.

In May 1999, the Yabloko faction voted for the impeachment of President Yeltsin. The bulk of the State Duma deputies supported the accusation of the president of unleashing war in Chechnya and 24 deputies voted for the impeachment of Yeltsin on charges of an armed dispersal of the Supreme Council in October 1993. Yabloko, however, refused to support other articles of accusations, including the article proposed by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation about the &quot;genocide of the Russian people.&quot; Yabloko criticized presidential and government policies and regularly voted against draft state budgets submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers to the Duma.

On August 16, 1999, 18 members of the Yabloko faction, including Yavlinsky, voted for the appointment of Vladimir Putin as Prime Minister, 4 members abstained, 8 voted against, and 15 did not vote. In May 2000, 4 deputies of the Yabloko faction voted for the appointment of Mikhail Kasyanov as prime minister, 8 members voted against and 4 abstained. Yabloko also supported a bill developed with the participation of faction deputy Mikhail Zadornov on the introduction of a flat income tax instead of a progressive taxation scale.

Since Putin was never supported by a majority of Yabloko members, the party found itself in fierce opposition to the government, criticizing the government during the remaining term of the State Duma of the third convocation, especially as parliamentary elections approached.

In December 2001, on the basis of the all-Russian political public organization Yabloko and the Party of Social Liberalism the &quot;Russian Democratic Party Yabloko&quot; was officially created, which advocates the European path of development of the Russian Federation and is a member of several international and European organizations. Since November 1998, the Yabloko association has had observer status with the Liberal International and participated in its events. At the 51st Congress of the Liberal International, held on March 21–23, 2002 in Budapest, the Yabloko party was accepted into the ranks of this international organization as a full member.

On April 26, 2002, the Russian Democratic Party Yabloko (Reg. No. 5018) was registered by the Ministry of Justice. Grigory Yavlinsky was elected chairman of the party.

=== Political party (2002 to present) ===
According to the deputy chairman of Yabloko, Sergei Ivanenko, in 2002 the party had 20,000 members.

In June 2003, the Yabloko faction voted for a vote of no confidence in the government, which, however, was not approved by the Duma.

Since 2003, Yabloko&#x27;s position has worsened. In the 2003 State Duma elections, the Yabloko party received 4.3% of the vote (less than the 5% threshold) and did not receive seats in the State Duma on party lists (only 4 candidates from the party went through single-mandate constituencies). Interestingly, the fact that Vladimir Putin called Grigory Yavlinsky at night, during the counting of votes, with congratulations on the victory, became widely known.

After the joining of Green Russia and Soldiers&#x27; Mothers in 2006, the name of the party was changed to the Russian United Democratic Party &quot;Yabloko&quot; (RODP &quot;Yabloko&quot;). Since 2006, the Yabloko party has become part of the European party Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). Sergey Mitrokhin became party chairman in 2008.

In the 2007 elections, only 1.59% of voters voted for Yabloko, and the party did not enter the State Duma again. In 2008 the party had 58,540 members. In the 2011 elections according to official data from the CEC, 3.43% of voters (2.25 million people) voted for Yabloko. In these elections, the party more than doubled its result but still did not get into the State Duma. However, this result gave Yabloko the possibility of state funding. In 2012 Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky was not registered by the Central Election Commission as a candidate for the presidential elections.

In 2021 the party had 16,100 members.

In the elections to the State Duma of 2021, Grigory Yavlinsky for the first time in the history of the party refused to run for deputies, and the federal list of candidates was headed by Yabloko chairman Nikolay Rybakov. 1.34% of voters voted for Yabloko (750 000 people).
On October 14, 2021, the Federal Political Committee of the party decided to withdraw from the election candidates who supported the idea of Smart Voting Alexei Navalny. Several Yabloko members criticized the party&#x27;s policies and demanded the leadership to resign.

On October 26, 2021, the members of the Arkhangelsk regional branch of Yabloko published a statement, in which they demanded that the central political committee of the party be dismissed due to the adoption of the so-called “Yavlinsky blacklist”, which lead to the suspension of the activities of the branch. On November 19, 2021, the federal bureau of Yabloko appointed the re-registration of party members prior to the upcoming party congress in December

==== Russian invasion of Ukraine and stance on war in Ukraine ====
On February 13, 2022, Yabloko published a petition against a possible war with Ukraine. Yabloko is opposing Russia&#x27;s 2022 attack on Ukraine and has been taking part in protests against the war. After the beginning of the invasion, the Federal Political Committee of the party declared &quot;“Yabloko expresses its categorical protest against the outbreak of hostilities against Ukraine. This war is Russia&#x27;s war with the objective course of history, a war against time, a tragic fall from the reality of the modern world. The consequences of this war will last for a very long time, but now, first of all, it is a tragedy, suffering, and death of people, and this will never be corrected. The reason for the tragedy is lies, cruelty, and absolute indifference to the people of the Russian authorities. The Yabloko party considers the war with Ukraine to be the gravest crime. We believe that this war is contrary to the national interests of Russia and destroys the future of Russia.”&quot; On February 28, 2022, the Yabloko factions in the parliaments of Moscow, St. Petersburg, the Pskov region, and Karelia tried to initiate appeals from their legislative assemblies to President Putin with a call to immediately stop hostilities on the territory of Ukraine and start peace negotiations with international mediation, withdraw military units to places of permanent deployment, to exchange prisoners on the principle of “all for all”. Several members of the Yabloko party in various regions were detained for participating in anti-war protests.

===== Exclusion of members =====
Over the entire history of the party, several prominent party members were excluded, who became prominent politicians on their own: Oksana Dmitriyeva, Alexei Navalny, Maxim Reznik, Maxim Katz, and Ilya Yashin.

The period of Sergey Mitrokhin was marked not only by the exclusion of members but also by the suspension of the powers of the regional branches. It was the case in party regional branches in Omsk, Belgorod (for cooperation with United Russia party), Bryansk (for the removal of the chairman of the local branch – candidate for governor of the region Andrei Ponomarev – from the elections in the interests of the current governor of the region Nikolai Denin, later accused of corruption), Krasnodar (for violating party discipline), St. Petersburg, and several other branches.

In 2020, the Federal leadership of Yabloko decided to exclude the chairman of the Novosibirsk branch , and three of her associates from the party. The leadership considered that they &quot;did not comply with the decision of the party bureau and publicly declared their disagreement with it, which caused political damage to the party&quot;. In addition to Kaverzina, Anton Nelidov, Mikhail Ryazantsev, and Vyacheslav Udintsev lost their membership in the party.

Also in 2020, the Federal Bureau of Yabloko expelled other 16 people from the party, including Maxim Katz, co-founder of the City Projects Foundation. The decision of the bureau announced that Katz tried to gain control over the Moscow branch of the party by creating an &quot;artificial majority&quot; of his supporters who voted unanimously. Katz announced his intention to appeal the bureau&#x27;s decision.

In 2021, mass expulsions from the party as part of the “fight against katzism” and for signing open appeals of party members to the Congress continued. At least 98 members were expelled from the Moscow branch (according to one of the excluded – more than 200).

The expelled members announced that they would form a new, independent from the party leadership organization, as well as that the current leadership of the party &quot;is conducting a systematic fight against civil society&quot;, &quot;justifies the repressions&quot; and &quot;accuses those who fight against them&quot;. The creation of the public movement &quot;Yabloko&quot; was announced, the declared aim to return the party under the control of their like-minded people or creating a new legal entity.

In addition, 189 members were denied registration, and 488 were suspended, depriving them of the right to any form of participation in internal elections. Many suspended party members consider this action to be inconsistent with the law on political parties and challenge it in court.

== Ideology ==

=== Political memorandum ===
In 2015, Yabloko adopted a Political Memorandum, which is a summary of the party&#x27;s ideology. The new version of the memorandum was adopted in 2019. The document, in support of its provisions, must be signed by Yabloko candidates in elections at all levels.

Contents of the memorandum:

# Our country needs deep and comprehensive political reforms aimed at moving from an authoritarian system of power to a real separation of powers, independent, fair and merciful justice, full-fledged local self-government, transparency of the legislative and executive authorities and their accountability to citizens, to fair elections and depoliticization of law enforcement agencies.
# Bolshevism and Stalinism are misanthropic ideologies and practices. The state must give a legal assessment of the coup d&#x27;état of 1917–1918 and the heinous crimes that followed.
# Nationalism and religious fundamentalism in any form and manifestation are unacceptable.
# The transition from an authoritarian regime to a democratic one must be peaceful, non-violent and carried out in a legal, constitutional way.
# An immediate cessation of the arms race, a renunciation of state propaganda for war, militarization of the country, threats and intimidation in foreign policy is necessary.
# It is necessary to completely separate business and property from the authorities (which were merged due to the erroneous policies of the 1990s and 2000s), and to refuse to support oligarchic business from the budget. The transition from a resource-based economy to a modern high-tech economy is obligatory.
# It is necessary openly and publicly investigate all facts of corruption in the Government, the Presidential Administration, law enforcement agencies, state companies and state corporations. The perpetrators must be punished, whoever it may concern.
# Political repressions must be stopped, all repressive laws restricting human rights and freedoms, enshrined in the second chapter of the Constitution of the Russian Federation (including the anti-orphan law, restriction of the right to rallies, conferring the status of a &quot;foreign agent&quot; on NGOs and the law on undesirable foreign organizations) must be abolished. It is necessary to abolish censorship in the media, social networks and culture, stop the arbitrary blocking the Internet resources.
# Russia must recognize the sovereignty of Ukraine within the 2013 borders, stop supporting crime and separatists, inciting hatred and propaganda for war. The solution of the Crimean issue is possible in accordance with the road map developed within the framework of a specially convened international conference.
# A worthy and successful future for Russia can only be based on the values of freedom, human rights, the principles of democracy, the rule of law and the inviolability of private property.

==== The process of ideological self-determination of the party ====
Yabloko arose and developed in line with the democratic movement as an alliance of political groups representing various ideological currents – liberals, social democrats, Christian democrats. In the process of forming the party, it was necessary to decide what &quot;niche&quot; in the party-political spectrum it would occupy – whether it would eventually become a social democratic or liberal party. It was also necessary to decide which particular formula of liberalism could most accurately express its ideological credo. The decisive factor that influenced this decision was the attitude to the ongoing changes in the country.

At the II Congress of Yabloko (September 1995), the program document &quot;The Path of Russian Reforms&quot; was adopted, containing a negative assessment of the first results of Russian reforms, which were characterized as follows:

* politics – authoritarian tendencies, accompanied by disorganization and disorder;
* economy – the foundation for economic growth has not been created;
* society – growing discontent and disappointment due to the deterioration of the social situation and a sharp drop in living standards.

The congress document formulated a fundamental vision of the reforms – that they should be carried out in the interests of the majority of the population.

The idea was put forward to return control powers to the parliament and thus eliminate the possibility of one authority appropriating the powers of another. The advancement of these principles meant the establishment of Yabloko as a political association of a social-liberal type.

==== &quot;Yabloko&quot; about Russian specifics ====
According to the founders of the Yabloko party, European models of liberalism are preferable to American ones. Recognizing the civilizational, socio-cultural specifics of Russia, the leaders of Yabloko insisted on the need to take it into account when implementing reforms. This specificity primarily includes the traditionally high role of the state in the economic life of the country, the steady orientation of significant sections of the population towards ensuring that state institutions provide social assistance. Analyzing the features of the socio-economic and historical evolution of Russia, representatives of Yabloko paid special attention to disproportions in the development of our country. For the success of the reforms, it is necessary to eliminate these disproportions, which is possible only with an effective regulatory role of the state.

==== Social democracy ====
Among the founders of Yabloko was a group of social democrats, but as a result of the discussion, it was initially decided not to identify themselves social democrats. In this regard, Grigory Yavlinsky noted:Our ideological model is based on the need to combine liberal and social democratic approaches in Russia. This is a feature of Russia, in which we must be liberals in order to protect private property, achieve tax cuts, maximum freedoms for entrepreneurs, large-scale development of private entrepreneurship, because without this it is impossible to create a “public pie”. But we must not forget that Russia is a country that cannot exist without free education, without high-quality free healthcare. We cannot forget how many pensioners we have, how many people with disabilities, how many territories we have that today do not yet fit into the liberal approach ... We must do everything to ensure that the liberal foundations of the economy are as deep as possible, and at the same time solve the country&#x27;s priority social tasks.In the first half of the 1990s, the ideas of socialism were generally not popular in the democratic movement. Yabloko&#x27;s distancing from social democracy was manifested in the party&#x27;s attitude to such a principle as social justice. In 1995, Grigory Yavlinsky said:The social justice thesis is one of the most dangerous theses that can exist. It has been proven many times that the struggle for social justice sooner or later ends in terrible tragedies. Therefore, for our country, the thesis would be correct not about social justice, but about social acceptability. This is a dynamic situation, which suggests that at different stages, under different conditions, society can agree with certain social costs. Especially during the period of reforms. And if, instead of organizing an efficient economy, we again begin to seek justice, while realizing that it does not exist, that this is an abstract thesis, we will again and again push people into social conflicts.

==== Land – Housing – Roads ====
A book with a program titled &quot;Land – Housing – Roads&quot; was distributed by the party. To the housing issue: a breakthrough strategy contains a description of the strategy “Land – housing – roads”, approved by decision No. 10 of February 28, 2009 of the Political Committee of the RODP “Yabloko”. The strategy is positioned by the party as aimed at a comprehensive withdrawal of the country from the crisis.

In the period after the publication, the program was a permanent part of the Yabloko party election program.

== Politics ==

=== Yukos ===
On April 22, 2005, in connection with the completion of the trial of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, Grigory Yavlinsky issued an open statement in which he indicated:&quot;This process has nothing to do with strengthening the rule of law in the country, or at least establishing some kind of order ... Instead, it created an atmosphere of intimidation and legal chaos in the country ... The number of procedural violations during the process exceeded all possible limits, and the consequences of this will take a very long time to overcome. Probably, since the time of Stalin and the shooting within &quot;anti-thieves&quot; decrees of Khrushchev in the 1950s. The right was not violated so revealingly and rudely. And after such a high-profile precedent, this will have fatal consequences for thousands of entrepreneurs across the country&quot;.According to Yavlinsky, when organizing the trial, the Russian authorities set three goals: to prevent the sale of Yukos to foreigners, to intimidate and subjugate Russian big business, and to put Yukos under the control of a certain group of government officials. Wherein:&quot;Since none of the objectives could be achieved by legal means..., brute force was used, under the guise of, as far as possible, quasi-legal procedures&quot;.Yavlinsky believes that with this process “the political elite of the country begins a new stage: physical persecution and, possibly, destruction of each other ... This is a war that has no end. Its goal is the destruction of people from the highest echelons of power and business, current and former, the destruction of the fate of their loved ones and families.”&quot;Such a wheel can only be rolled – and it cannot be stopped. Repressions – revenge, new repressions – new revenge. Is it really not clear that the current top will be the same in a few years ...? Stalin&#x27;s bloody 20 years showed that repressions within the political class are continuous and pointless – everyone lives in an atmosphere of fear of the future. Because if our country smells the smell of repression and blood, it will not stop for a long time. The execution of 1993 and the subsequent war of 1994, which lasted for more than 10 years, is from this area ... The imprisonment of Khodorkovsky and Lebedev is the way into repression and revenge. After that, no one can feel safe anymore – neither the accused, nor the accusers, nor the members of their families. This is the path to self-destruction of the nation and the country. The political class and top business in Russia must understand that the day the verdict of imprisonment is announced is the actual beginning of physical mutual destruction ... &lt;...&gt; Without a doubt, only President Putin can make a decision. It is necessary to proceed from reality – the outcome of the Yukos case, the imprisonment or not of Khodorkovsky, as well as the term of this imprisonment, entirely depend on the decision of Vladimir Putin. He actually bears political and moral responsibility for it. It is not necessary, taking advantage of your position of power, to put your opponents (or opponents of your entourage) in prison. And so much has already happened to make the situation irreversible, but in the main thing – as far as people&#x27;s lives are concerned, there is still an opportunity to stop.

=== Chechen conflict ===
According to the Yabloko party, the Chechen problem is very complicated and ambiguous. It was provoked, according to the party, by the wrong policy of the Russian leadership, which dragged Russia into a protracted bloody conflict that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and created conditions for criminal business in Chechnya. The Chechen war caused very high military spending and also threatened the safety of many people. After the defeat of the Supreme Soviet in 1993, Yeltsin needed, according to the party, a &quot;small victorious war&quot; that would provide an excellent opportunity to show the power of power. In addition, at that time the power of the Chechen criminal communities on Russian territory increased enormously, and Dzhokhar Dudayev greatly weakened his position by his actions.

The Yabloko party, however, believes that restoring constitutional order is one thing, but demonstrating strength is another. Especially when this demonstration is carried out in order to distract the people from the socio-economic crisis in the country. November 29, 1994 Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued an ultimatum to all forces in Chechnya. On December 5, Yabloko gathered a delegation ready to replace Russian tankmen prisoners of war – officers and soldiers of the Kantemirovskaya division, who participated in the unsuccessful attempt to storm Grozny on November 26, allegedly carried out by anti-Dudaev opposition forces as hostages. Dzhokhar Dudayev agreed to meet with Russian deputies, including Grigory Yavlinsky and Sergei Yushenkov. The deputies arrived in Grozny, but the negotiation process was disrupted – according to Yavlinsky, this happened because &quot;the negotiations were not part of the authorities&#x27; plan for a small victorious war.&quot; The peaceful initiatives of Yabloko were not accepted by either the broad masses or the State Duma. The majority of the Duma deputies refused to consider the bill “On delegations for the settlement of the armed conflict in the Chechen Republic”.

The “easy war”, however, did not work out – it hit the whole society hard. The capture of Grozny by militants in March 1996, a year after the city was taken by federal troops, demonstrated the weakness of the federal troops, which then led to the Khasavyurt agreements. The only faction that supported the Khasavyurt agreements was the Yabloko faction. Three years later, during the impeachment of Boris Yeltsin, Yabloko formulated its position as follows:&quot;... Responsibility for this war lies not only with Yeltsin and Dudayev&#x27;s regime. It is also borne by the military leaders who gave and carried out criminal orders, the head of the government, Chernomyrdin, his deputies, ministers, bear this guilt and politicians, some of whom supported this war, others did not want to stop, and still others could not. However, we, Yabloko, are also responsible, because we did not do everything possible, not all of our resources were devoted to stopping the slaughter. Since no one can fix what happened, there is only one responsibility – to create such conditions under which what happened will never happen again. We, Yabloko, consider ourselves obligated to do everything possible to minimize the likelihood of such tragedies recurring in the future. Today we are obliged to create a precedent for punishing the authorities for crimes. The inevitable responsibility and punishability of the authorities for crimes against their own people is real democracy.&quot;However, a long-term peace did not work out, and as a result, events quickly escalated into the Second Chechen War. Nevertheless, even then Yabloko advocated the possibility of negotiations. In October 2002, during the seizure of hostages by Chechen terrorists in the theater center on Dubrovka in Moscow, one of the demands of the bandits was the participation of Grigory Yavlinsky in the negotiations. After the tragedy, Grigory Yavlinsky made a statement that expressed the official point of view of the Yabloko party:&quot;We firmly believe that there can be no justification for terrorism – neither political, nor religious, nor by good causes, not even by so-called &quot;symmetrical and retaliatory&quot; measures, or any other. There is no justification for killing or threatening, blackmailing by killing innocent, defenseless people. In this sense, the cause of terrorism is not poverty or suffering, and not even revenge (which is directed at the guilty), but boundless meanness ... Undoubtedly, those who embark on the path of terror must be brought to justice or, if this is not possible, eliminated. However, what happened with a new acuteness raises the question of resolving the armed conflict in Chechnya, of ending the cleansings, torture, kidnappings, extrajudicial killings, bullying, unlimited physical violence – in essence, the cessation of the most brutal war to exterminate an entire people. All efforts to find political ways to end the war are required to be repeatedly intensified. All lessons must be learned from this tragedy.&quot;

=== The death penalty ===
Yabloko advocates the complete abolition of the death penalty in Russia. After on February 10, 2013, the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, Vladimir Kolokoltsev, in an interview with the program &quot;Saturday Vesti&quot; of the TV channel Russia-1 said that he had nothing against the return of the death penalty in Russia, this caused severe criticism from the party, on the website of which there was a proposal to send the minister to resign.

=== LGBT rights ===
The Yabloko party has repeatedly advocated for the rights of the LGBT community. On April 5, 2012, activists of the Amur branch of the party organized a rally for the rights of LGBT people agreed with the authorities. In 2016, the St. Petersburg branch of the party included items on support for LGBT people in the program, and in 2017, in the program of the electoral association &quot;Yabloko Party in Moscow&quot; during the elections of deputies of representative bodies of local self-government in the city of Moscow, it was recorded that that party candidates oppose discrimination based on sexual orientation. Also in 2016, the pre-election plan for the legislative work of the Yabloko faction in the State Duma included a clause on the need to repeal the law on liability for &quot;propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations&quot;. The need to repeal this law was also discussed on the party&#x27;s pre-election website. And the federal program of the party declared the need to develop &quot;such forms of interpersonal support as a civil partnership that allows people who are not related to each other to provide each other with mutual support and assistance, providing citizens who enter into such a partnership with the opportunity to visit each other in a hospital, joint ownership property, inheritance, etc.&quot; The youth and gender factions of the Yabloko party have repeatedly made statements and held actions in support of the rights of the LGBT community.

Some well-known Yabloko supporters, including Galina Mikhaleva, Maxim Reznik and Aleksey Melnikov, support LGBT people. &quot;Protection against discrimination of the LGBT community&quot; was identified in 2011 as one of the new areas of work for the gender faction. Members of the Moscow Yabloko took part in the events of the Week Against Homophobia in 2011, and the Moscow Youth Yabloko issued a special statement in support of it. Also, Youth Yabloko planned to participate in the Equality March in 2011. Party leaders Sergei Mitrokhin and Grigory Yavlinsky have repeatedly condemned homophobia. Nikolai Kavkazsky, a member of the Youth Yabloko, noted that &quot;the gay parade is not a carnival, but a human rights event &lt;...&gt; which should be held more often than once a year&quot;. However, LGBT support is not included in the party program.

Deputy of the State Duma of the III convocation Alexander Fedulov, head of the Kursk party organization of Yabloko, in the summer of 2011 appealed to the President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev with an appeal to &quot;protect the moral and spiritual health of the absolute majority of Russians from the aggressive, impudent&quot; pink-and-blue &quot;minority&quot;, after which he was criticized by Sergei Mitrokhin, who noted that &quot;In a civilized state, the rights of citizens must be respected regardless of their nationality, social class and sexual orientation.&quot;

Sergei Mitrokhin at the same time called on the LGBT community to refrain from holding gay pride parades &quot;provoking part of the Russian society to aggression and violence – against not only the participants in the parades themselves, but in general all citizens of non-traditional sexual orientation&quot;.

Later, Alexander Fedulov was expelled from the party &quot;for repeated public statements and statements of a nationalist and misanthropic nature, as well as support for the leadership of an authoritarian-oligarchic corrupt regime&quot;.

On April 2, 2017, the party adopted a statement on the inadmissibility of the genocide of the LGBT community in the Chechen Republic.

On March 28, 2019, the position of the Yabloko party against LGBT discrimination was published on the official website of the party. In it, the party refers to its program documents and documents of international organizations to which it is a member. The party stated that:

The protection of human rights in relation to representatives of the LGBT community is one of the important areas of the human rights activities of the Yabloko party.

<doc id="429581" wikidata="Q521263" url="?curid=429581" title="History of Tibet">
<text>While the Tibetan plateau has been inhabited since pre-historic times, most of Tibet&#x27;s history went unrecorded until the creation of Tibetan script in the 7th century. Tibetan texts refer to the kingdom of Zhangzhung (c. 500 BCE – 625 CE) as the precursor of later Tibetan kingdoms and the originators of the Bon religion. While mythical accounts of early rulers of the Yarlung dynasty exist, historical accounts begin with the introduction of Tibetan script from the unified Tibetan Empire in the 7th century. Following the dissolution of the empire and a period of fragmentation in the 9th–10th centuries, a Buddhist revival in the 10th–12th centuries saw the development of three of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

After a period of control by the Mongol Empire and the Yuan dynasty, Tibet effectively became independent in the 14th century and was ruled by a succession of noble houses for the next 300 years. In the 16th century, the Dalai Lama title was created by Altan Khan, and as requested by the family of Altan Khan, seal of authority was granted to the Dalai Lama by the Wanli Emperor. In the 17th century, the senior lama of the Gelug school, the Dalai Lama, became the head of state with the aid of the Khoshut Khanate. Seal of authority and golden sheets were granted by the Shunzhi Emperor to both the Dalai Lama and the founder Güshi Khan of Khoshut Khanate in 1653. In 1717, the Dzungar Khanate invaded Lhasa, killed Lha-bzang Khan of the Khoshut Khanate, which effectively destroyed the Khoshut Khanate. The Qing dynasty then sent military troops in the same year to fight the Dzungars, but failed. In 1720, the Qing dynasty sent troops for the second time and drove away the Dzungar army. It remained a Qing territory until the fall of the dynasty. In 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama went into exile in India in response to hostilities with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). The PRC annexation in 1951 and flight of the Dalai Lama created several waves of Tibetan refugees and led to the creation of Tibetan diasporas in India, the United States, and Europe.

The Tibet Autonomous Region was established following the PRC annexation, although Tibetan independence and human rights emerged as international issues, gaining significant visibility alongside the 14th Dalai Lama in the 1980s and 1990s. Chinese authorities have sought to assert control over Tibet and has been accused of the destruction of religious sites and banning possession of pictures of the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan religious practices. During the crises created by the Great Leap Forward, Tibet was subjected to mass starvation. The PRC disputes these claims and points to their investments in Tibetan infrastructure, education, and industrialization as evidence that they have replaced a theocratic feudal government with a modern state.

==Geographical setting==
Tibet lies between the civilizations of China proper and Indian subcontinent. Extensive mountain ranges to the east of the Tibetan Plateau mark the border with the Chinese heartland, and the Himalayas of the republics of Nepal and India separate the plateau from the subcontinent lying south. Tibet has been called the &quot;roof of the world&quot; and &quot;the land of snows&quot;.

Linguists classify the Tibetan language and its dialects as belonging to the Tibeto-Burman languages, the non-Sinitic members of the broader Sino-Tibetan language family.

==Prehistory==
Some archaeological data suggest archaic humans passed through Tibet at the time India was first inhabited, half a million years ago. Impressions of hands and feet suggest hominins were present at the above 4,000 meters above sea level high Tibetan Plateau 169,000–226,000 years ago. Modern humans first inhabited the Tibetan Plateau at least twenty-one thousand years ago. This population was largely replaced around 3000 years ago by Neolithic immigrants from northern China. However, there is a &quot;partial genetic continuity between the Paleolithic inhabitants and the contemporary Tibetan populations&quot;. The vast majority of Tibetan maternal mtDNA components can trace their ancestry to both paleolithic and Neolithic during the mid-Holocene.

Megalithic monuments dot the Tibetan Plateau and may have been used in ancestor worship. Prehistoric Iron Age hillforts and burial complexes have recently been found on the Tibetan Plateau, but the remote high altitude location makes archaeological research difficult.

==Early history (c. 500 BC – AD 618)==

===Zhangzhung kingdom (c. 500 BC – AD 625)===

According to Namkhai Norbu some Tibetan historical texts identify the Zhang Zhung culture as a people who migrated from the Amdo region into what is now the region of Guge in western Tibet. Zhang Zhung is considered to be the original home of the Bön religion.

By the 1st century BC, a neighboring kingdom arose in the Yarlung Valley, and the Yarlung king, Drigum Tsenpo, attempted to remove the influence of the Zhang Zhung by expelling the Zhang&#x27;s Bön priests from Yarlung. Tsenpo was assassinated and Zhang Zhung continued its dominance of the region until it was annexed by Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century.

===Tibetan tribes (2nd century AD)===
In AD 108, &quot;the Kiang or Tibetans, a nomad from south-west of Koko-nor, attacked the Chinese posts of Gansu, threatening to cut the Dunhuang road. Liang Kin, at the price of some fierce fighting, held them off.&quot; Similar incursions were repelled in AD 168–169 by the Chinese general Duan Gong.

Chinese sources of the same era mention of a Fu state () of either Qiang or Tibetan ethnicity &quot;more than two thousand miles northwest of Shu County&quot;. Fu state was pronounced as &quot;bod&quot; or &quot;phyva&quot; in Archaic Chinese. Whether this polity is the precursor of Tufan is still unknown.

===First kings of the pre-Imperial Yarlung dynasty (2nd–6th centuries)===

The pre-Imperial Yarlung dynasty rulers are considered mythological because sufficient evidence of their existence has not been found.

Nyatri Tsenpo is considered by traditional histories to have been the first king of the Yarlung dynasty, named after the river valley where its capital city was located, approximately fifty-five miles south-east from present-day Lhasa. The dates attributed to the first Tibetan king, Nyatri Tsenpo (), vary. Some Tibetan texts give 126 BC, others 414 BC.

Nyatri Tsenpo is said to have descended from a one-footed creature called the Theurang, having webbed fingers and a tongue so large it could cover his face. Due to his terrifying appearance he was feared in his native Puwo and exiled by the Bön to Tibet. There he was greeted as a fearsome being, and he became king.

The Tibetan kings were said to remain connected to the heavens via a &quot;dmu&quot; cord (&quot;dmu thag&quot;) so that rather than dying, they ascended directly to heaven, when their sons achieved their majority. According to various accounts, king Drigum Tsenpo (&quot;Dri-gum-brtsan-po&quot;) either challenged his clan heads to a fight, or provoked his groom &quot;Longam&quot; (&quot;Lo-ngam&quot;) into a duel. During the fight the king&#x27;s &quot;dmu&quot; cord was cut, and he was killed. Thereafter Drigum Tsenpo and subsequent kings left corpses and the Bön conducted funerary rites.

In a later myth, first attested in the &quot;Maṇi bka&#x27; &#x27;bum&quot;, the Tibetan people are the progeny of the union of the monkey Pha Trelgen Changchup Sempa and rock ogress Ma Drag Sinmo. But the monkey was a manifestation of the bodhisattva Chenresig, or Avalokiteśvara (Tib. &quot;Spyan-ras-gzigs&quot;) while the ogress in turn incarnated Chenresig&#x27;s consort Dolma (Tib. &quot;&#x27;Grol-ma&quot;).

==Tibetan Empire (618–842)==

The Yarlung kings gradually extended their control, and by the early 6th century most of the Tibetan tribes were under its control, when Namri Songtsen (570?–618?/629), the 32nd King of Tibet of the Yarlung dynasty, gained control of all the area around what is now Lhasa by 630, and conquered Zhangzhung. With this extent of power the Yarlung kingdom turned into the Tibetan Empire.

The government of Namri Songtsen sent two embassies to China in 608 and 609, marking the appearance of Tibet on the international scene. From the 7th century AD Chinese historians referred to Tibet as Tubo (), though four distinct characters were used. The first externally confirmed contact with the Tibetan kingdom in recorded Tibetan history occurred when King Namri Löntsän (&quot;Gnam-ri-slon-rtsan&quot;) sent an ambassador to China in the early 7th century.

Traditional Tibetan history preserves a lengthy list of rulers whose exploits become subject to external verification in the Chinese histories by the 7th century. From the 7th to the 11th centuries a series of emperors ruled Tibet (see List of emperors of Tibet) of whom the three most important in later religious tradition were Songtsen Gampo, Trisong Detsen and Ralpacan, &quot;the three religious kings&quot; (&quot;mes-dbon gsum&quot;), who were assimilated to the three protectors (&quot;rigs-gsum mgon-po&quot;), respectively, Avalokiteśvara, Mañjuśrī and Vajrapāni. Songtsen Gampo (c. 604–650) was the first great emperor who expanded Tibet&#x27;s power beyond Lhasa and the Yarlung Valley, and is traditionally credited with introducing Buddhism to Tibet.

Throughout the centuries from the time of the emperor the power of the empire gradually increased over a diverse terrain so that by the reign of the emperor in the opening years of the 9th century, its influence extended as far south as Bengal and as far north as Mongolia. Tibetan records claim that the Pala Empire was conquered and that the Pala emperor Dharmapala submitted to Tibet, though no independent evidence confirms this.

The varied terrain of the empire and the difficulty of transportation, coupled with the new ideas that came into the empire as a result of its expansion, helped to create stresses and power blocs that were often in competition with the ruler at the center of the empire. Thus, for example, adherents of the Bön religion and the supporters of the ancient noble families gradually came to find themselves in competition with the recently introduced Buddhism.

==Era of Fragmentation and Cultural Renaissance (9th–12th centuries)==

===Fragmentation of political power (9th–10th centuries)===

The Era of Fragmentation was a period of Tibetan history in the 9th and 10th centuries. During this era, the political centralization of the earlier Tibetan Empire collapsed. The period was dominated by rebellions against the remnants of imperial Tibet and the rise of regional warlords. Upon the death of Langdarma, the last emperor of a unified Tibetan empire, there was a controversy over whether he would be succeeded by his alleged heir Yumtän (&quot;Yum brtan&quot;), or by another son (or nephew) Ösung (&quot;″Od-srung&quot;; either 843–905 or 847–885). A civil war ensued, which effectively ended centralized Tibetan administration until the Sa-skya period. Ösung&#x27;s allies managed to keep control of Lhasa, and Yumtän was forced to go to Yalung, where he established a separate line of kings. In 910, the tombs of the emperors were defiled.

The son of Ösung was Pälkhortsän (&quot;Dpal &#x27;khor brtsan&quot;; 865–895 or 893–923). The latter apparently maintained control over much of central Tibet for a time, and sired two sons, Trashi Tsentsän (&quot;Bkra shis brtsen brtsan&quot;) and Thrikhyiding (&quot;Khri khyi lding&quot;), also called Kyide Nyimagön (&quot;Skyid lde nyi ma mgon&quot;) in some sources. Thrikhyiding migrated to the western Tibetan region of upper Ngari (&quot;Stod Mnga ris&quot;) and married a woman of high central Tibetan nobility, with whom he founded a local dynasty.

After the breakup of the Tibetan empire in 842, Nyima-Gon, a representative of the ancient Tibetan royal house, founded the first Ladakh dynasty. Nyima-Gon&#x27;s kingdom had its centre well to the east of present-day Ladakh. Kyide Nyigön&#x27;s eldest son became ruler of the Maryul (Ladakh region), and his two younger sons ruled western Tibet, founding the Kingdom of Guge– Purang and Zanskar– Spiti. Later the king of Guge&#x27;s eldest son, Kor-re, also called Jangchub Yeshe-Ö (&quot;Byang Chub Ye shes&#x27; Od&quot;), became a Buddhist monk. He sent young scholars to Kashmir for training and was responsible for inviting Atiśa to Tibet in 1040, thus ushering in the Chidar (&quot;Phyi dar&quot;) phase of Buddhism in Tibet. The younger son, Srong-nge, administered day-to-day governmental affairs; it was his sons who carried on the royal line.

===Tibetan Renaissance (10th–12th centuries)===

According to traditional accounts, Buddhism had survived surreptitiously in the region of Kham. The late 10th century and 11th century saw a revival of Buddhism in Tibet. Coinciding with the early discoveries of &quot;hidden treasures&quot; (&quot;terma&quot;), the 11th century saw a revival of Buddhist influence originating in the far east and far west of Tibet.

Muzu Saelbar (&quot;Mu-zu gSal-&#x27;bar&quot;), later known as the scholar Gongpa Rabsal (&quot;bla chen dgongs pa rab gsal&quot;; 832–915), was responsible for the renewal of Buddhism in northeastern Tibet, and is counted as the progenitor of the Nyingma (&quot;Rnying ma pa&quot;) school of Tibetan Buddhism. In the west, Rinchen Zangpo (958–1055) was active as a translator and founded temples and monasteries. Prominent scholars and teachers were again invited from India.

In 1042 Atiśa (982–1054 CE) arrived in Tibet at the invitation of a west Tibetan king. This renowned exponent of the Pāla form of Buddhism from the Indian university of Vikramashila later moved to central Tibet. There his chief disciple, Dromtonpa, founded the Kadampa school of Tibetan Buddhism under whose influence the New Translation schools of today evolved.

The Sakya, the &quot;Grey Earth&quot; school, was founded by Khön Könchok Gyelpo (, 1034–1102), a disciple of the great Lotsawa, Drogmi Shākya (). It is headed by the Sakya Trizin, traces its lineage to the mahasiddha Virūpa, and represents the scholarly tradition. A renowned exponent, Sakya Pandita (1182–1251CE), was the great-grandson of Khön Könchok Gyelpo.

Other seminal Indian teachers were Tilopa (988–1069) and his student Naropa (probably died ca. 1040 CE). The Kagyu, the &quot;Lineage of the (Buddha&#x27;s) Word&quot;, is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic. It contains one major and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master Naropa via Marpa Lotsawa, Milarepa and Gampopa.

==Mongol conquest and Yuan administrative rule (1240–1354)==
During this era, the region was dominated by the Sakya lama with the Mongols&#x27; support, so it is also called the Sakya dynasty. The first documented contact between the Tibetans and the Mongols occurred when the missionary Tsang-pa Dung-khur (&quot;gTsang-pa Dung-khur-ba&quot;) and six disciples met Genghis Khan, probably on the Tangut border where he may have been taken captive, around 1221–22. He left Mongolia as the Quanzhen sect of Daoism gained the upper hand, but remet Genghis Khan when Mongols conquered Tangut shortly before the Khan&#x27;s death. Closer contacts ensued when the Mongols successively sought to move through the Sino-Tibetan borderlands to attack the Jin dynasty and then the Southern Song, with incursions on outlying areas. One traditional Tibetan account claims that there was a plot to invade Tibet by Genghis Khan in 1206, which is considered anachronistic as there is no evidence of Mongol-Tibetan encounters prior to the military campaign in 1240. The mistake may have arisen from Genghis&#x27;s real campaign against the Tangut Xixia.

The Mongols invaded Tibet in 1240 with a small campaign led by the Mongol general Doorda Darkhan that consisted of 30,000 troops. The battle resulted in Darkhan&#x27;s troops suffering 500 casualties. The Mongols withdrew their soldiers from Tibet in 1241, as all the Mongol princes were recalled back to Mongolia in preparation for the appointment of a successor to Ögedei Khan. They returned to the region in 1244, when Köten delivered an ultimatum, summoning the abbot of Sakya (&quot;Kun-dga&#x27; rGyal-mtshan&quot;) to be his personal chaplain, on pains of a larger invasion were he to refuse. Sakya Paṇḍita took almost 3 years to obey the summons and arrive in Kokonor in 1246, and met Prince Köten in Lanzhou the following year. The Mongols had annexed Amdo and Kham to the east, and appointed Sakya Paṇḍita Viceroy of Central Tibet by the Mongol court in 1249.

Tibet was incorporated into the Mongol Empire, retaining nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. This existed as a &quot;diarchic structure&quot; under the Mongol emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols. Within the branch of the Mongol Empire in China known as the Yuan dynasty, Tibet was managed by the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs or Xuanzheng Yuan, separate from other Yuan provinces such as those governed the former Song dynasty of China. One of the department&#x27;s purposes was to select a dpon-chen, usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the Yuan emperor in Beijing. &quot;The Mongol dominance was most indirect: Sakya lamas remained the sources of authority and legitimacy, while the dpon-chens carried on the administration at Sakya. When a dispute developed between dpon-chen Kung-dga&#x27; bzari-po and one of &#x27;Phags-pa&#x27;s relatives at Sakya, the Chinese troops were dispatched to execute the dpon-chen.&quot;

In 1253, Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280) succeeded Sakya Pandita at the Mongol court. Phagpa became a religious teacher to Kublai Khan. Kublai Khan appointed Chögyal Phagpa as his Imperial Preceptor (originally State Preceptor) in 1260, the year when he became Khagan. Phagpa developed the priest-patron concept that characterized Tibeto-Mongolian relations from that point forward. With the support of Kublai Khan, Phagpa established himself and his sect as the preeminent political power in Tibet. Through their influence with the Mongol rulers, Tibetan lamas gained considerable influence in various Mongol clans, not only with Kublai, but, for example, also with the Il-Khanids.

In 1265, Chögyal Phagpa returned to Tibet and for the first time made an attempt to impose Sakya hegemony with the appointment of Shakya Bzang-po, a longtime servant and ally of the Sakyas, as the dpon-chen (&#x27;great administrator&#x27;) over Tibet in 1267. A census was conducted in 1268 and Tibet was divided into thirteen myriarchies (administrative districts, nominally containing 10,000 households). By the end of the century, Western Tibet lay under the effective control of imperial officials (almost certainly Tibetans) dependent on the &#x27;Great Administrator&#x27;, while the kingdoms of Guge and Pu-ran retained their internal autonomy.

The Sakya hegemony over Tibet continued into the mid-14th century, although it was challenged by a revolt of the Drikung Kagyu sect with the assistance of Duwa Khan of the Chagatai Khanate in 1285. The revolt was suppressed in 1290 when the Sakyas and eastern Mongols burned Drikung Monastery and killed 10,000 people.

Between 1346 and 1354, towards the end of the Yuan dynasty, the House of Pagmodru would topple the Sakya. The rule over Tibet by a succession of Sakya lamas came to a definite end in 1358, when central Tibet came under control of the Kagyu sect. &quot;By the 1370s, the lines between the schools of Buddhism were clear.&quot;

The following 80-or-so years were a period of relative stability. They also saw the birth of the Gelugpa school (also known as &quot;Yellow Hats&quot;) by the disciples of Tsongkhapa Lobsang Dragpa, and the founding of the Ganden, Drepung, and Sera monasteries near Lhasa. After the 1430s, the country entered another period of internal power struggles.

==Tibetan independence (14th–18th century)==
With the decline of the Yuan dynasty, Central Tibet was ruled by successive families from 14th to 17th centuries, to be succeeded by the Dalai Lama&#x27;s rule in the 17th and 18th centuries. Tibet would be de facto independent from the mid-14th century on, for nearly 400 years. In spite of the weakening of central authority, the neighbouring Ming dynasty of China made little effort to impose direct rule, although it had nominal claims of the Tibetan territory by establishing the U-Tsang Regional Military Commission and Do-Kham Regional Military Commission in the 1370s. They also kept friendly relations with some of the Buddhism religious leaders known as Princes of Dharma and granted some other titles to local leaders including the Grand Imperial Tutor.

===Family rule (14th–17th centuries)===

====Phagmodrupa (14th–15th centuries)====

The Phagmodru (Phag mo gru) myriarchy centered at Neudong (Sne&#x27;u gdong) was granted as an appanage to Hülegü in 1251. The area had already been associated with the Lang (Rlang) family, and with the waning of Ilkhanate influence it was ruled by this family, within the Mongol-Sakya framework headed by the Mongol appointed Pönchen (dpon-chen) at Sakya. The areas under Lang administration were continually encroached upon during the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Jangchub Gyaltsän (Byang chub rgyal mtshan, 1302–1364) saw these encroachments as illegal and sought the restoration of Phagmodru lands after his appointment as the Myriarch in 1322. After prolonged legal struggles, the struggle became violent when Phagmodru was attacked by its neighbours in 1346. Jangchub Gyaltsän was arrested and released in 1347. When he later refused to appear for trial, his domains were attacked by the Pönchen in 1348. Janchung Gyaltsän was able to defend Phagmodru, and continued to have military successes, until by 1351 he was the strongest political figure in the country. Military hostilities ended in 1354 with Jangchub Gyaltsän as the unquestioned victor, who established the Phagmodrupa dynasty in that year. He continued to rule central Tibet until his death in 1364, although he left all Mongol institutions in place as hollow formalities. Power remained in the hands of the Phagmodru family until 1434.

The rule of Jangchub Gyaltsän and his successors implied a new cultural self-awareness where models were sought in the age of the ancient Tibetan Kingdom. The relatively peaceful conditions favoured the literary and artistic development. During this period the reformist scholar Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419) founded the Gelug sect which would have a decisive influence on Tibet&#x27;s history.

====Rinpungpa family (15th–16th centuries)====
Internal strife within the Phagmodrupa dynasty and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435.

====Tsangpa dynasty (16th–17th centuries)====
In 1565 they were overthrown by the Tsangpa dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect. They would play a pivotal role in the events which led to the rise of power of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s in the 1640s.

===Ganden Phodrang government (17th–18th centuries)===

The &quot;Ganden Phodrang&quot; was the Tibetan government established in 1642 by the 5th Dalai Lama with the military assistance of Güshi Khan of the Khoshut Khanate. Lhasa became the capital of Tibet in the beginning of this period, with all temporal power being conferred to the 5th Dalai Lama by Güshi Khan in Shigatse.

====Rise of the Gelugpa school and the Dalai Lama====
The rise of the Dalai Lamas was intimately connected with the military power of Mongolian clans. Altan Khan, the king of the Tümed Mongols, first invited Sonam Gyatso, the head of the Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism (later known as the third Dalai Lama), to Mongolia in 1569 and again in 1578, during the reign of the Tsangpa family. Gyatso accepted the second invitation. They met at the site of Altan Khan&#x27;s new capital, Koko Khotan (Hohhot), and the Dalai Lama taught a large crowd there.

Sonam Gyatso publicly announced that he was a reincarnation of the Tibetan Sakya monk Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280) who converted Kublai Khan, while Altan Khan was a reincarnation of Kublai Khan (1215–1294), the famous ruler of the Mongols and Emperor of China, and that they had come together again to cooperate in propagating the Buddhist religion. While this did not immediately lead to a massive conversion of Mongols to Buddhism (this would only happen in the 1630s), it did lead to the widespread use of Buddhist ideology for the legitimation of power among the Mongol nobility. Last but not least, Yonten Gyatso, the fourth Dalai Lama, was a grandson of Altan Khan.

====Khoshut-Gelugpa alliance====
Yonten Gyatso (1589–1616), the fourth Dalai Lama and a non-Tibetan, was the grandson of Altan Khan. He died in 1616 in his mid-twenties. Some people say he was poisoned but there is no real evidence one way or the other.

Lobsang Gyatso (Wylie transliteration: Blo-bzang Rgya-mtsho), the Great Fifth Dalai Lama (1617–1682), was the first Dalai Lama to wield effective political power over central Tibet.

The Fifth Dalai Lama&#x27;s first regent Sonam Rapten is known for unifying the Tibetan heartland under the control of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, after defeating the rival Kagyu and Jonang sects and the secular ruler, the Tsangpa prince, in a prolonged civil war. His efforts were in large part successful due to the military aid contributed by Güshi Khan, the Oirat Khoshut leader of the Khoshut Khanate. The positions of the Dalai Lama, Sonam Rapten, and the khans have been subject to various interpretations. Some sources claim the khan appointed Sonam Rapten as &quot;de facto&quot; administrator of civil affairs while the Dalai Lama was relegated to religious matters. Other sources claim that Güshi Khan was largely uninvolved in the administration of Tibet and remained in Kokonor after defeating the enemies of the Gelugpa school.

The 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates, especially Sonam Rapten (until his death in 1658), established a civil administration referred to by historians as the &quot;Lhasa state&quot;. This Tibetan administration is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang, named after the 5th Dalai Lama&#x27;s residence in Drepung Monastery.

Sonam Rapten was a fanatical and militant proponent of the Gelugpa. Under his administration, the other schools were persecuted. Jonang sources today claim that the Jonang monasteries were either closed or forcibly converted, and that school remained in hiding until the latter part of the 20th century. However, before leaving Tibet for China in 1652 the Dalai Lama issued a proclamation or decree to Sonam Rapten banning all such sectarian policies that had been implemented by his administration after the 1642 civil war, and ordered their reversal. According to FitzHerbert and, there was an increase in the 5th Dalai Lama&#x27;s &quot;day-to-day control of ... his government&quot; after the deaths of Sonam Rapten and Güshi Khan in the 1650s.

The 5th Dalai Lama initiated the construction of the Potala Palace in Lhasa in 1645. During the rule of the Great Fifth, two Jesuit missionaries, the German Johannes Gruber and Belgian Albert Dorville, stayed in Lhasa for two months, October and November, 1661 on their way from Peking to Portuguese Goa, in India. In 1652, the 5th Dalai Lama visited the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty. He was not required to kowtow like other visitors, but still had to kneel before the Emperor; and he was later sent an official seal.

The death of the 5th Dalai Lama in 1682 was kept hidden for fifteen years by his assistant confidant, Desi Sangye Gyatso. The 6th Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, was enthroned in the Potala on 7 or 8 December 1697. In 1705–6, conflict between the 6th Dalai Lama&#x27;s regent and the Khoshut Khanate led to the seizure of Lhasa by Lha-bzang Khan, who murdered the regent and deposed the 6th Dalai Lama. A pretender, Yeshe Gyatso, was installed by Lha-bzang until the Dzungar Khanate invaded in 1717 and removed the Khoshut khan and pretender from power. The 7th Dalai Lama was installed but the Dzungars terrorized the people, leading to loss of goodwill from the Tibetans. The Dzungars were ousted in 1720 by the Qing dynasty.

==Qing conquest and administrative rule (1720–1912)==
The Qing rule over Tibet was established after a Qing expedition forces defeated the Dzungars who occupied Tibet until 1720. The Qing rule lasted until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. The Qing emperors appointed imperial residents known as the Ambans to Tibet, who commanded over 2,000 troops stationed in Lhasa and reported to the Lifan Yuan, a Qing government agency that oversaw the region during this period. During this era, the region was dominated by the Dalai Lamas with the support from the Qing dynasty established by the Manchus in China.
===Qing rule===

====Qing conquest====
The Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty sent an expedition army to Tibet in response to the occupation of Tibet by the forces of the Dzungar Khanate, together with Tibetan forces under Polhanas (also spelled Polhaney) of Tsang and Kangchennas (also spelled Gangchenney), the governor of Western Tibet, they expelled the Dzungars from Tibet in 1720. They brought Kelzang Gyatso with them from Kumbum to Lhasa and he was installed as the 7th Dalai Lama. Qing protectorate over Tibet was established at this time, with a garrison at Lhasa, and Kham was annexed to Sichuan. In 1721, the Qing established a government in Lhasa consisting of a council (the &quot;Kashag&quot;) of three Tibetan ministers, headed by Kangchennas. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s role at this time was purely symbolic, but still highly influential because of the Mongols&#x27; religious beliefs.

After the succession of the Yongzheng Emperor in 1722, a series of reductions of Qing forces in Tibet occurred. However, Lhasa nobility who had been allied with the Dzungars killed Kangchennas and took control of Lhasa in 1727, and Polhanas fled to his native Ngari. Qing troops arrived in Lhasa in September, and punished the anti-Qing faction by executing entire families, including women and children. The Dalai Lama was sent to Lithang Monastery in Kham. The Panchen Lama was brought to Lhasa and was given temporal authority over Tsang and Ngari, creating a territorial division between the two high lamas that was to be a long lasting feature of Chinese policy toward Tibet. Two &quot;ambans&quot; were established in Lhasa, with increased numbers of Qing troops. Over the 1730s, Qing troops were again reduced, and Polhanas gained more power and authority. The Dalai Lama returned to Lhasa in 1735, temporal power remained with Polhanas. The Qing found Polhanas to be a loyal agent and an effective ruler over a stable Tibet, so he remained dominant until his death in 1747.

At multiple places such as Lhasa, Batang, Dartsendo, Lhari, Chamdo, and Litang, Green Standard Army troops were garrisoned throughout the Dzungar war. Green Standard Army troops and Manchu Bannermen were both part of the Qing force who fought in Tibet in the war against the Dzungars. It was said that the Sichuan commander Yue Zhongqi (a descendant of Yue Fei) entered Lhasa first when the 2,000 Green Standard soldiers and 1,000 Manchu soldiers of the &quot;Sichuan route&quot; seized Lhasa. According to Mark C. Elliott, after 1728 the Qing used Green Standard Army troops to man the garrison in Lhasa rather than Bannermen. According to Evelyn S. Rawski both Green Standard Army and Bannermen made up the Qing garrison in Tibet. According to Sabine Dabringhaus, Green Standard Chinese soldiers numbering more than 1,300 were stationed by the Qing in Tibet to support the 3,000-strong Tibetan army.

The Qing had made the region of Amdo and Kham into the province of Qinghai in 1724, and incorporated eastern Kham into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728. The Qing government sent a resident commissioner (&quot;amban&quot;) to Lhasa. Polhanas&#x27; son Gyurme Namgyal took over upon his father&#x27;s death in 1747. The &quot;ambans&quot; became convinced that he was going to lead a rebellion, so they killed him. News of the incident leaked out and a riot broke out in the city, the mob avenged the regent&#x27;s death by killing the &quot;ambans&quot;. The Dalai Lama stepped in and restored order in Lhasa. The Qianlong Emperor (Yongzheng&#x27;s successor) sent Qing forces to execute Gyurme Namgyal&#x27;s family and seven members of the group that killed the &quot;ambans&quot;. The Emperor re-organized the Tibetan government (&quot;Kashag&quot;) again, nominally restoring temporal power to the Dalai Lama, but in fact consolidating power in the hands of the (new) &quot;ambans&quot;.

====Expansion of control over Tibet====
The defeat of the 1791 Nepalese invasion increased the Qing&#x27;s control over Tibet. From that moment, all important matters were to be submitted to the &quot;ambans&quot;. It strengthened the powers of the &quot;ambans&quot;. The &quot;ambans&quot; were elevated above the Kashag and the regents in responsibility for Tibetan political affairs. The Dalai and Panchen Lamas were no longer allowed to petition the Qing Emperor directly but could only do so through the &quot;ambans&quot;. The &quot;ambans&quot; took control of Tibetan frontier defense and foreign affairs. The &quot;ambans&quot; were put in command of the Qing garrison and the Tibetan army (whose strength was set at 3,000 men). Trade was also restricted and travel could be undertaken only with documents issued by the &quot;ambans&quot;. The &quot;ambans&quot; were to review all judicial decisions. However, according to Warren Smith, these directives were either never fully implemented, or quickly discarded, as the Qing were more interested in a symbolic gesture of authority than actual sovereignty. In 1841, the Hindu Dogra dynasty attempted to establish their authority on Ü-Tsang but were defeated in the Sino-Sikh War (1841–1842).

In the mid-19th century, arriving with an Amban, a community of Chinese troops from Sichuan who married Tibetan women settled down in the Lubu neighborhood of Lhasa, where their descendants established a community and assimilated into Tibetan culture. Hebalin was the location of where Chinese Muslim troops and their offspring lived, while Lubu was the place where Han Chinese troops and their offspring lived.

===European influences in Tibet===
 

The first Europeans to arrive in Tibet were Portuguese missionaries who first arrived in 1624 led by António de Andrade. They were welcomed by the Tibetans who allowed them to build a church. The 18th century brought more Jesuits and Capuchins from Europe. They gradually met opposition from Tibetan lamas who finally expelled them from Tibet in 1745. Other visitors included, in 1774 a Scottish nobleman, George Bogle, who came to Shigatse to investigate trade for the British East India Company, introducing the first potatoes into Tibet.
After 1792 Tibet, under Chinese influence, closed its borders to Europeans and during the 19th century only 3 Westerners, the Englishman Thomas Manning and 2 French missionaries Huc and Gabet, reached Lhasa, although a number were able to travel in the Tibetan periphery.

During the 19th century the British Empire was encroaching from northern India into the Himalayas and Afghanistan and the Russian Empire of the tsars was expanding south into Central Asia. Each power became suspicious of intent in Tibet. But Tibet attracted the attention of many explorers. In 1840, Sándor Kőrösi Csoma arrived in Darjeeling, hoping that he would be able to trace the origin of the Magyar ethnic group, but died before he was able to enter Tibet.
In 1865 Great Britain secretly began mapping Tibet. Trained Indian surveyor-spies disguised as pilgrims or traders, called pundits, counted their strides on their travels across Tibet and took readings at night. Nain Singh, the most famous, measured the longitude, latitude and altitude of Lhasa and traced the Yarlung Tsangpo River.

===British expedition to Tibet===
At the beginning of the 20th century the British and Russian Empires were competing for supremacy in Central Asia. Unable to establish diplomatic contacts with the Tibetan government, and concerned about reports of their dealings with Russia, in 1903–04, a British expedition led by Colonel Francis Younghusband was sent to Lhasa to force a trading agreement and to prevent Tibetans from establishing a relationship with the Russians. In response, the Qing foreign ministry asserted that China was sovereign over Tibet, the first clear statement of such a claim. Before the British expedition arrived in Lhasa, the 13th Dalai Lama fled to Outer Mongolia, and then went to Beijing in 1908.

The British expedition was one of the triggers for the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion at Batang monastery, when anti-foreign Tibetan lamas massacred French missionaries, Manchu and Han Qing officials, and Christian converts before Qing forces crushed the revolt.

The Anglo-Tibetan Treaty of Lhasa of 1904 was followed by the Sino-British treaty of 1906. Beijing agreed to pay London 2.5 million rupees which Lhasa was forced to agree upon in the Anglo-Tibetan treaty of 1904. In 1907, Britain and Russia agreed that in &quot;conformity with the admitted principle of the suzerainty of China over Tibet&quot; both nations &quot;engage not to enter into negotiations with Tibet except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government.&quot;

The Qing government in Beijing then appointed Zhao Erfeng, the Governor of Xining, &quot;Army Commander of Tibet&quot; to reintegrate Tibet into China. He was sent in 1905 (though other sources say this occurred in 1908) on a punitive expedition. His troops destroyed a number of monasteries in Kham and Amdo, and a process of sinification of the region was begun. The Dalai Lama once again fled, this time to India, and was once again deposed by the Chinese. The situation was soon to change, however, as, after the fall of the Qing dynasty in October 1911, Zhao&#x27;s soldiers mutinied and beheaded him. All remaining Qing forces left Tibet after the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil.

==&quot;De facto&quot; independence (1912–1951)==
The Dalai Lama returned to Tibet from India in July 1912 (after the fall of the Qing dynasty), and expelled the &quot;Amban&quot; and all Chinese troops. In 1913, the Dalai Lama issued a proclamation that stated that the relationship between the Chinese emperor and Tibet &quot;had been that of patron and priest and had not been based on the subordination of one to the other.&quot; &quot;We are a small, religious, and independent nation&quot;, the proclamation continued.

For the next thirty-six years, Tibet enjoyed &quot;de facto&quot; independence while China endured its Warlord era, civil war, and World War II. Some Chinese sources argue that Tibet was part of China throughout this period. A book published in 1939 by a Swedish sinologist and linguist about the war in China placed Tibet as part of China. The Chinese government in the 1930s tried to claim superiority. The USA also recognised Tibet as a province of China during this time as seen in the documentary film &quot;Why We Fight&quot; #6 &quot;The Battle of China&quot; produced by the USA War Department in 1944. Some other authors argue that Tibet was also de jure independent after Tibet-Mongolia Treaty of 1913, before which Mongolia has been recognized by Russia.

Tibet continued in 1913–1949 to have very limited contacts with the rest of the world, although British representatives were stationed in Gyantse, Yatung and Gartok (western Tibet) after the Younghusband Mission. These so-called &quot;Trade Agents&quot; were in effect diplomatic representatives of the British Government of India and in 1936–37 the British also established a permanent mission in Lhasa. This was in response to a Chinese &quot;condolence mission&#x27; sent to the Tibetan capital after the demise of the 13th Dalai Lama which remained in Lhasa as, in effect, a Republican Chinese diplomatic post. After 1947 the British mission was transferred to the newly independent Indian government control although the last British representative, Hugh Richardson remained in Lhasa until 1950 serving the Indian government. The British, like the Chinese, encouraged the Tibetans to keep foreigners out of Tibet and no foreigners visited Lhasa between the departure of the Younghusband mission in 1904 and the arrival of a telegraph officer in 1920. Just over 90 European and Japanese visited Lhasa during the years 1920–1950, most of whom were British diplomatic personnel. Very few governments did anything resembling a normal diplomatic recognition of Tibet. In 1914 the Tibetan government signed the Simla Accord with Britain, ceding the several small areas on the southern side of the Himalayan watershed to British India. The Chinese government denounced the agreement as illegal.

In 1932, the National Revolutionary Army, composed of Muslim and Han soldiers, led by Ma Bufang and Liu Wenhui defeated the Tibetan army in the Sino-Tibetan War when the 13th Dalai Lama tried to seize territory in Qinghai and Xikang. It was also reported that the central government of China encouraged the attack, hoping to solve the &quot;Tibet situation&quot;, because the Japanese had just seized Manchuria. They warned the Tibetans not to dare cross the Jinsha river again. A truce was signed, ending the fighting. The Dalai Lama had cabled the British in India for help when his armies were defeated, and started demoting his Generals who had surrendered.

==People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s rule (1950–present)==
In 1949, seeing that the Chinese Communists, with the decisive support from Joseph Stalin, were gaining control of China, the Kashag expelled all Chinese who were connected with the Chinese government, triggering protests by both the Kuomintang and the Communists. The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), founded in October 1949 by the victorious Communists under the leadership of Mao Zedong, lost little time in asserting a new Chinese presence in Tibet. In October 1950, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army entered the Tibetan area of Chamdo, defeating sporadic resistance from the Tibetan army. In 1951, Tibetan representatives participated in negotiations in Beijing with the Chinese government. This resulted in a &quot;Seventeen Point Agreement&quot; which formalized China&#x27;s sovereignty over Tibet, but was repudiated by the present Tibetan government-in-exile.

From the beginning, it was obvious that incorporating Tibet into Communist China would bring two opposite social systems face-to-face. In Tibet, however, the Chinese Communists opted not to place social reform as an immediate priority. On the contrary, from 1951 to 1959, traditional Tibetan society with its lords and manorial estates continued to function unchanged. Despite the presence of twenty thousand Chinese soldiers in Central Tibet, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s government was permitted to maintain important symbols from its de facto independence period.

The Communists quickly abolished slavery and serfdom in their traditional forms. They also claim to have reduced taxes, unemployment, and beggary, and to have started work projects. They established secular schools, thereby breaking the educational monopoly of the monasteries, and they constructed running water and electrical systems in Lhasa.

The Tibetan region of Eastern Kham, previously Xikang province, was incorporated in the province of Sichuan. Western Kham was put under the Chamdo Military Committee. In these areas, land reform was implemented. This involved communist agitators designating &quot;landlords&quot;—sometimes arbitrarily chosen—for public humiliation in thamzing () or &quot;Struggle Sessions&quot;, torture, maiming, and even death.
By 1956 there was unrest in eastern Kham and Amdo, where land reform had been implemented in full. These rebellions eventually spread into western Kham and Ü-Tsang.

In 1956–57, armed Tibetan guerrillas ambushed convoys of the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army. The uprising received extensive assistance from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), including military training, support camps in Nepal, and several airlifts. Meanwhile, in the United States, the American Society for a Free Asia, a CIA-financed front, energetically publicized the cause of Tibetan resistance, with the Dalai Lama&#x27;s eldest brother, Thubten Norbu, playing an active role in that organization. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s second-eldest brother, Gyalo Thondup, established an intelligence operation with the CIA as early as 1951. He later upgraded it into a CIA-trained guerrilla unit whose recruits parachuted back into Tibet.

Many Tibetan commandos and agents whom the CIA dropped into the country were chiefs of aristocratic clans or the sons of chiefs. Ninety percent of them were never heard from again, according to a report from the CIA itself, meaning they were most likely captured and killed. Ginsburg and Mathos reached the conclusion, that &quot;As far as can be ascertained, the great bulk of the common people of Lhasa and of the adjoining countryside failed to join in the fighting against the Chinese both when it first began and as it progressed.&quot; According to other data, many thousands of common Tibetans participated in the rebellion. Declassified Soviet archives provides data that Chinese communists, who received a great assistance in military equipment from the USSR, broadly used Soviet aircraft for bombing monasteries and other punitive operations in Tibet.

In 1959, China&#x27;s military crackdown on rebels in Kham and Amdo led to the &quot;Lhasa Uprising.&quot; Full-scale resistance spread throughout Tibet. Fearing capture of the Dalai Lama, unarmed Tibetans surrounded his residence, and the Dalai Lama fled to India.

The period from 1959 to 1962 was marked by extensive starvation during the Great Chinese Famine brought about by drought and by the Chinese policies of the Great Leap Forward which affected all of China and not only Tibet. The Tenth Panchen Lama was a keen observer of Tibet during this period and penned the 70,000 Character Petition to detail the sufferings of the Tibetans and sent it to Zhou Enlai in May 1962.

In 1962, China and India fought a brief war over the disputed Aksai Chin region. Although China won the war, Chinese troops withdrew north of the McMahon Line.
In 1965, the area that had been under the control of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s government from the 1910s to 1959 (Ü-Tsang and western Kham) was renamed the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR). Autonomy provided that the head of government would be an ethnic Tibetan; however, actual power in the TAR is held by the First Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who has never been a Tibetan. The role of ethnic Tibetans in the higher levels of the TAR Communist Party remains very limited.

The destruction of most of Tibet&#x27;s more than 6,000 monasteries occurred between 1959 and 1961 by the Chinese Communist Party. During the mid-1960s, the monastic estates were broken up and secular education introduced. During the Cultural Revolution. Red Guards inflicted a campaign of organized vandalism against cultural sites in the entire PRC, including Tibet&#x27;s Buddhist heritage.

When General Secretary Hu Yaobang visited Tibet in 1980 and 1982, he disagreed with what he viewed as heavy-handedness. Hu reduced the number of Han party cadre, and relaxed social controls.

In 1989, the Panchen Lama died of a massive heart attack at the age of 50.

The PRC continues to portray its rule over Tibet as an unalloyed improvement, but as some foreign governments continue to make protests about aspects of PRC rule in Tibet as groups such as Human Rights Watch report alleged human rights violations. Most governments, however, recognize the PRC&#x27;s sovereignty over Tibet today, and none have recognized the Government of Tibet in Exile in India.

Riots flared up again in 2008. Many ethnic Hans and Huis were attacked in the riot, their shops vandalized or burned. The Chinese government reacted swiftly, imposing curfews and strictly limiting access to Tibetan areas. The international response was likewise immediate and robust, with some leaders condemning the crackdown and large protests and some in support of China&#x27;s actions.

In 2018, German car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz reverted an advertisement and apologized for &#x27;hurting feelings&#x27; of Chinese people by quoting the Dalai Lama.

Since 2009, at least 160 Tibetans, including monks, nuns, and ordinary people, have self-immolated to protest Chinese policies in Tibet.

===Tibetans in exile===
Following the Lhasa uprising and the Dalai Lama&#x27;s flight from Tibet in 1959, the government of India accepted the Tibetan refugees. India designated land for the refugees in the mountainous region of Dharamsala, India, where the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile are now based.

The plight of the Tibetan refugees garnered international attention when the Dalai Lama, spiritual and religious leader of the Tibetan government in exile, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. The Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Prize on the basis of his unswerving commitment to peaceful protest against the Chinese occupation of Tibet. He is highly regarded as a result and has since been received by government leaders throughout the world. Among the most recent ceremonies and awards, he was given the Congressional Gold Medal by President Bush in 2007, and in 2006 he was one of only seven people to ever receive an honorary Canadian citizenship (see Honorary Canadian citizenship). The PRC consistently protests each official contact with the exiled Tibetan leader.

The community of Tibetans in exile established in Dharamshala and Bylakuppe near Mysore in Karnataka, South India, has expanded since 1959. Tibetans have duplicated Tibetan monasteries in India and these now house tens of thousands of monks. They have also created Tibetan schools and hospitals, and founded the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives—all aimed at continuing Tibetan tradition and culture. Tibetan festivals such as Lama dances, celebration of Losar (the Tibetan New Year), and the Monlam Prayer Festival, continue in exile.

In 2006, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama declared that &quot;Tibet wants autonomy, not independence.&quot; However, the Chinese distrust him, believing that he has not really given up the quest for Tibetan independence.

Talks between representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government began again in May, 2008 with little result.

<text>Gyebaek, or Kyebaek (died 20 August 660), was a general in the ancient Korean kingdom of Baekje during the early to mid-7th century. Little else is known of his personal life—including the year and location of his birth.

==The Last Battle==
In 660, Baekje was invaded by a force of 50,000 from Silla, supported by 144,000 Tang soldiers. Gyebaek, with only 5,000 troops under his command, met them in the battlefield of Hwangsanbeol. Before entering the battlefield, Gyebaek reportedly killed his wife and children to prevent them from being enslaved if he lost.

His forces won four initial battles, causing severe casualties to Silla forces. General Gyebaek fought very courageously and killed many Silla soldiers. However, in the end, exhausted and surrounded, Gyebaek&#x27;s army was outnumbered and overwhelmed. Baekje&#x27;s forces were annihilated in battle along with their leader Gyebaek.

==Aftermath==
Baekje was destroyed, shortly after Gyebaek&#x27;s defeat and death at Hwangsanbeol.

As Neo-Confucian philosophy became more influential in the later Korean Dynasties, Gyebaek was recognized by historians and scholars as exemplifying the Confucian ideals of patriotism and devotion to his king, Uija, and praised as such. Although not much else is known about Gyebaek&#x27;s life, his actions leading up to his last battle are well known to many Koreans.

==In Taekwon-Do==
Gye Baek (also written Gae Baek or Ge Baek in various Taekwondo manuals) is the 12th pattern or hyeong in the International Taekwon-Do Federation form of the Korean martial art taekwondo. It is practised by the 1st Dan black belt. The pattern has 44 moves, and the diagram (I) represents his severe and strict military discipline.

<text>Richard Caddel (13 July 1949 – 1 April 2003) was a poet, publisher and editor who was a key figure in the British Poetry Revival.

==Biography==
Caddel was born in Bedford and grew up in Gillingham, Kent. He studied music at the University of Newcastle, but changed to English after meeting poets Basil Bunting and Tom Pickard. He helped Tom and Connie Pickard organise the seminal Morden Tower poetry readings.

Caddel&#x27;s work was influenced by Bunting, by the Americans Lorine Niedecker, Louis Zukofsky, Robert Creeley and William Carlos Williams, and by the English landscape tradition as represented by John Clare.

He published a number of small pamphlets, most of which were collected in three books: &quot;Sweet Cicely&quot; (1983), &quot;Uncertain Time&quot; (1990) and &quot;Larksong Signal&quot; (1997). A volume of selected poems, &quot;Magpie Words&quot;, appeared in 2002. His final book, &quot;Writing In The Dark&quot;, was published in late 2003.

With his wife Ann Caddel, he ran Pig Press, through which he published a number of British, Irish and American poets of the latter half of the 20th century.

Caddel edited Bunting&#x27;s &quot;Uncollected Poems&quot; in 1991 and his &quot;Complete Poems&quot; in 1994. With Peter Quartermain, he edited the anthology &quot;Other: British And Irish Poetry Since 1970&quot; (1998). He served as Director of the Basil Bunting Poetry Centre at Durham University for a number of years up to his death.

A lifelong asthmatic, Caddel died of leukaemia on 1 April 2003.

<doc id="429592" wikidata="Q266421" url="?curid=429592" title="Harlequin-type ichthyosis">
<text>Harlequin-type ichthyosis is a genetic disorder that results in thickened skin over nearly the entire body at birth. The skin forms large, diamond/trapezoid/rectangle-shaped plates that are separated by deep cracks. These affect the shape of the eyelids, nose, mouth, and ears and limit movement of the arms and legs. Restricted chest movement can lead to breathing difficulties. These plates fall off over several weeks. Other complications can include premature birth, infection, problems with body temperature, and dehydration. The condition is the most severe form of ichthyosis (except for syndromes that include ichthyosis, for example, Neu–Laxova syndrome), a group of genetic disorders characterised by scaly skin.
Harlequin-type ichthyosis is caused by mutations in the &quot;ABCA12&quot; gene. This gene codes for a protein necessary for transporting lipids out of cells in the outermost layer of skin. The disorder is autosomal recessive and inherited from parents who are carriers. Diagnosis is often based on appearance at birth and confirmed by genetic testing. Before birth, amniocentesis or ultrasound may support the diagnosis.
There is no cure for the condition. Early in life, constant supportive care is typically required. Treatments may include moisturizing cream, antibiotics, etretinate or retinoids. Around half of those affected die within the first few months; however, retinoid treatment can increase chances of survival. Children who survive the first year of life often have long-term problems such as red skin, joint contractures and delayed growth. The condition affects around 1 in 300,000 births. It was first documented in a diary entry by Reverend Oliver Hart in America in 1750.

==Signs and symptoms==
Newborns with harlequin-type ichthyosis present with thick, fissured armor-plate hyperkeratosis. Sufferers feature severe cranial and facial deformities. The ears may be very poorly developed or absent, as may the nose. The eyelids may be everted (ectropion), which leaves the eyes and the area around them very susceptible to infection. Babies with this condition often bleed during birth. The lips are pulled back by the dry skin (eclabium).

Joints sometimes lack movement and may be below the normal size. Hypoplasia is sometimes found in the fingers. Polydactyly has been found on occasion. The fish mouth appearance, mouth breathing, and xerostomia place affected individuals at extremely high risk for developing rampant dental decay.

People with this condition are extremely sensitive to changes in temperature due to their hard, cracked skin, which prevents normal heat loss. The skin also restricts respiration, which impedes the chest wall from expanding and drawing in enough air. This can lead to hypoventilation and respiratory failure. Patients are often dehydrated, as their plated skin is not well suited to retaining water.

== Cause ==

Harlequin-type ichthyosis is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the &quot;ABCA12&quot; gene. This gene is important in regulating protein synthesis for the development of the skin layer. Mutations in the gene cause impaired transport of lipids in the skin layer and may also lead to shrunken versions of the proteins responsible for skin development. Less severe mutations result in a collodion membrane and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma-like presentation.

ABCA12 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter), which is a member of a large family of proteins that hydrolyze ATP to transport cargo across cell membranes. ABCA12 is thought to be a lipid transporter in keratinocytes necessary for lipid transport into lamellar granules during the formation of the lipid barrier in the skin.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of harlequin-type ichthyosis relies on both physical examination and laboratory tests. Physical assessment at birth is vital for the initial diagnosis of harlequin ichthyosis. Physical examination reveals characteristic symptoms of the condition, especially the abnormalities in the skin surface of newborns. Abnormal findings in physical assessments usually result in employing other diagnostic tests to ascertain the diagnosis.

Genetic testing is the most specific diagnostic test for harlequin ichthyosis. This test reveals a loss of function mutation on the &quot;ABCA12&quot; gene. A skin biopsy may be done to assess the histologic characteristics of the cells. Histological findings usually reveal hyperkeratotic skin cells, which leads to a thick, white, and hard skin layer.

==Treatment==
Constant care is required to moisturize and protect the skin. The hard outer layer eventually peels off, exposing the vulnerable inner layers of the dermis. Early complications result from infection due to fissuring of the hyperkeratotic plates and respiratory distress due to physical restriction of chest wall expansion.

Management includes supportive care and treatment of hyperkeratosis and skin barrier dysfunction. A humidified incubator is generally used. Intubation is often required until nares are present. Nutritional support with tube feeding is essential until eclabium resolves and infants can begin nursing. Ophthalmologic consultation is useful for the early management of ectropion, which is initially pronounced and resolves as scales are shed. Liberal application of petroleum jelly is needed multiple times daily.

In addition, careful debridement of constrictive bands of hyperkeratosis should be performed to avoid digital ischemia. Cases of digital autoamputation or necrosis have been reported due to cutaneous constriction bands. Relaxation incisions have been used to prevent this complication.

== Prognosis ==
In the past, the disorder was nearly always fatal, whether due to dehydration, infection (sepsis), restricted breathing due to the plating, or other related causes. The most common cause of death was systemic infection, and sufferers rarely survived for more than a few days. Improved neonatal intensive care and early treatment with oral retinoids, such as the drug isotretinoin, may improve survival. Early oral retinoid therapy has been shown to soften scales and encourage desquamation. After as little as two weeks of daily oral isotretinoin, fissures in the skin can heal, and plate-like scales can nearly resolve. Improvement in the eclabium and ectropion can also be seen in weeks.

Children who survive the neonatal period usually develop a less severe phenotype, resembling a severe congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. People continue to suffer from temperature dysregulation and may have heat and cold intolerance. Patients can have generalized poor hair growth, scarring alopecia, contractures of digits, arthralgias, failure to thrive, hypothyroidism, and short stature. Some patients develop a rheumatoid factor-positive polyarthritis. Survivors can also develop fish-like scales and retention of a waxy, yellowish material in seborrheic areas, with ear adhered to the scalp.

Most infants do not live past a week. Those who survive can live from around 10 months to 25 years thanks to advanced medicine.

A study published in 2011 in the Archives of Dermatology concluded: &quot;&quot;Harlequin ichthyosis&quot; should be regarded as a severe chronic disease that is not invariably fatal. Survival has increased with improved neonatal care and the early introduction of oral retinoids.
== Epidemiology ==
The condition occurs in roughly 1 in 300,000 people. As an autosomal recessive condition, there is a higher likelihood of consanguinity.

==History==
The disease has been known since 1750 and was first described in the diary of Rev. Oliver Hart from Charleston, South Carolina:

&quot;On Thursday, April the 5th, 1750, I went to see a most deplorable object of a child, born the night before of one Mary Evans in &#x27;Chas&#x27;town. It was surprising to all who beheld it, and I scarcely know how to describe it. The skin was dry and hard and seemed to be cracked in many places, somewhat resembling the scales of a fish. The mouth was large and round and open. It had no external nose, but two holes where the nose should have been. The eyes appeared to be lumps of coagulated blood, turned out, about the bigness of a plum, ghastly to behold. It had no external ears, but holes where the ears should be. The hands and feet appeared to be swollen, were cramped up and felt quite hard. The back part of the head was much open. It made a strange kind of noise, very low, which I cannot describe. It lived about forty-eight hours and was alive when I saw it.&quot;

The &quot;harlequin-type&quot; designation comes from the diamond shape of the scales at birth (resembling the costume of Arlecchino).

==Notable cases==

* Devan Mahadeo (June 11, 1985 – January 23, 2023) was born in Trinidad and Tobago and lived to be 37 years old. He was involved in the Special Olympics for over 17 years and participated in both the Winter and Summer Games. He earned silver medals in football at Dublin, Ireland, in 2003 and Shanghai, China, in 2007, bronze in floor hockey at the 2013 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and gold at the 2015 Special Olympics World Games in Los Angeles, California.
* Andrea Aberle (1969 – 2021) died at 51 years old, making her one of the longest-surviving individuals with harlequin ichthyosis, both in the US and globally. She lived in California with her husband before she died from skin-related complications.
* Nusrit &quot;Nelly&quot; Shaheen (born in 1984) of Coventry, England, was one of nine children. Four of her eight siblings also had the condition but died as young children. As of March 2017, Shaheen was among the oldest individuals with harlequin-type ichthyosis, at 33 years old).
* Ryan Gonzalez (born in 1986) was 18 as of 2004, and was featured in an episode of &quot;Medical Incredible&quot;.
* Stephanie Turner (1993 – 2017) third oldest in the US with the same condition, and the first ever to give birth. Turner&#x27;s two children do not have the disease. She died on March 3, 2017, at age 23.
* Mason van Dyk (born 2013), despite being given a life expectancy of one to five days, was 5 years old as of July 2018. Doctors told his mother, Lisa van Dyk, that he was the first case of harlequin ichthyosis in South Africa, and that she has a one-in-four chance of having another child with the disease.
* Hunter Steinitz (born October 17, 1994) as of June 2010 was 16 and one of only twelve Americans living with the disease, and was profiled on National Geographic&#x27;s &quot;Extraordinary Humans: Skin&quot; special.
* Mui Thomas (born in 1992 in Hong Kong) was 24 as of 2016 and qualified as the first rugby referee with harlequin ichthyosis.
* A female baby born in Nagpur, India in June 2016 died after two days. She was the first case of harlequin ichthyosis reported in India.
* Hannah Betts was born with the condition in 1989 in Great Britain, and died in 2022 at 32 years old.
* Ng Poh Peng was born in 1991 in Singapore. Doctors had not expected her to live past her teenage years. As of 2017, she was 26 years old.
* Evan Fasciano, born in 2011 in Connecticut, United States, was 13 as of April 2024.

<doc id="429594" wikidata="Q494501" url="?curid=429594" title="Kim Yu-sin">
<text>Kim Yu-sin (; 595 – 21 August 673) was a Korean military general and politician in 7th-century Silla. He led the unification of the Korean Peninsula by Silla under the reign of King Muyeol and King Munmu. He is said to have been the great-grandchild of King Guhae of Geumgwan Gaya, the last ruler of the Geumgwan Gaya state. This would have given him a very high position in the Silla bone rank system, which governed the political and military status that a person could attain.

Much of what is known about Kim&#x27;s life comes from the detailed account in the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, Yeoljeon 1-3, and the much briefer record in the &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot;, vol. 1.

== Early years ==
Kim Yu-sin was the son of General Kim Seohyeon (the second son of General Kim Mu-ryeok) and Lady Manmyeong, who was a daughter of Kim Sukheuljong (), who was the younger brother of King Jinheung. He was born in Manno county (; present-day Jincheon County) in 595, became a Hwarang warrior at just 15 and was an accomplished swordsman and a Gukseon (; Hwarang leader) by the time he was 18 years old. By the age of 34 (in 629) he had been given total command of the Silla armed forces. Three years later, Kim Yu-sin&#x27;s cousin, Princess Deokman, became Queen Seondeok and kept Kim Yu-sin as commander in chief of the royal army. During the reign of Queen Seondeok of Silla (632–647), Kim Yu-sin owned ten thousand private soldiers, won many battles against Baekje and became one of the most powerful men in Silla.

== Military accomplishments ==
Kim Yu-sin&#x27;s first military engagement in command is believed to have occurred around 629 AD, and through it he quickly proved his capabilities as a warrior. Silla was in a constant struggle with its neighbor to the west, Baekje, over territory. There had been gains and losses on both sides, and the struggle lasted for many years. It was during this period that Yu-sin rose through the ranks of the military, rising to the position of general and becoming a skilled field commander.

Baekje and Silla had formed an alliance to counter Goguryeo&#x27;s power and its intentions to push southwards, and together they launched a successful attack on it, Silla taking the northern territory and Baekje the one south of the Han river. But Silla broke the alliance and attacked Baekje in order to claim both territories for itself. After this betrayal, Baekje allied with Goguryeo. When Goguryeo and Baekje attacked Silla in 655, Silla joined forces with Tang dynasty China to battle the invaders. Although it is not clear when Kim Yu-sin first became a general, he was certainly commanding the Silla forces by this time. Eventually, with the help of a 50,000 man Silla army and some 130,000 Tang forces, Yushin attacked the Baekje capital, Sabi, in 660, in the Battle of Hwangsanbeol.

The Baekje defenders were commanded by General Gyebaek, but the Baekje forces only consisted of about 5,000 men and were no match for Yu-sin&#x27;s warriors, which numbered about ten times as many. Baekje, which had already been experiencing internal political problems, crumbled. Kim Yu-sin&#x27;s Silla forces and their Tang allies now moved on Goguryeo from two directions, and in 661 they attacked the seemingly impregnable Goguryeo kingdom, but were repelled. The attack had weakened Goguryeo, though. In 667 another offensive was launched which, in 668, finally destroyed Goguryeo.

Silla still had to subdue various pockets of resistance, but their efforts were then focused on ensuring that their Tang allies did not overstay their welcome on the peninsula. After some difficult conflicts, Silla eventually forced out the Tang troops and united the peninsula under their rule.

== Legends ==
Many legends exist about Kim Yu-sin. One legend states that Kim was once ordered to subdue a rebel army, but his troops refused to fight as they had seen a large star fall from the sky and took this to be a bad omen. To regain the confidence of his troops, the General used a large kite to carry a fire ball into the sky. The soldiers, seeing the star return to heaven, rallied and defeated the rebels. Other legends mention how General Kim ingeniously used kites as a means of communication between his troops when they had become divided between islands and the mainland.

Kim Yu-sin once spent the night at a courtesan&#x27;s tavern, and when his mother learned of this, she cried and asked Kim Yu-sin to never again set his foot in that kind of place. One night, Kim Yu-sin was very drunk, and his horse took him to the courtesan&#x27;s house. When Kim Yu-sin woke, he was angry at having broken his promise to his mother and slit the horse&#x27;s throat.

== His final years ==

Throughout his life, Kim Yu-sin felt that Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla should not be separate countries but rather united as one. He is regarded as the driving force in the unification of the Korean Peninsula, and is the most famous of all the generals in the unification wars of the Three Kingdoms.

Kim Yu-sin was rewarded handsomely for his efforts in the campaigns. In 668, King Munmu bestowed upon him the honorary title of &quot;Taedaegakgan&quot; (), something like &quot;Supreme Herald of Defense&quot; (literally &quot;greatest-great-trumpet-shield&quot;). He reportedly received a village of over 500 households, and in 669 was given some 142 separate horse farms, spread throughout the kingdom. He died four years later, leaving behind ten children.

Kim Yu-sin lived to the age of 79 and is considered to be one of the most famous generals and masters of Korean swords in Korean history. He is the focus of numerous stories and legends, and is familiar to most Koreans from a very early age. Following his death on 21 August (the 1st day of the 7th lunar month) 673, General Kim was awarded the honorary title of King Heungmu.

A tomb in Gyeongju is believed to belong to Kim, although its owner is debated by academics.

== Family ==
Kim Yu-sin had two sisters, Kim Bo-hee and Kim Mun-hee. Kim Mun-hee, later known as Queen Munmyeong, married Yu-sin&#x27;s friend Kim Cheon-chu, King Taejong Muyeol of Silla, who is credited for having led the unification of the Korean peninsula under Silla. Muyeol and Munmyeong were the parents of King Munmu of Silla and Kim Inmun.

Kim Yu-sin&#x27;s third wife, Lady Jiso (Hanja:智炤夫人), was the third daughter of King Muyeol of Silla. Yu-sin had ten children. His second son, Kim Won-sul, would later play a central role in completing the independence of Silla from the Tang dynasty.

*Wife: Lady Jiso, daughter of King Muyeol of Silla and Queen Munmyeong
**Son: Kim Sam-gwang (김삼광)
**Son: Kim Won-sul
**Son: Kim Won-jeong (김원정)

*Wife: Cheon Gwan-nyeo – Courtesan
**Son: Kim Gun-seung (김군승) or Kim Si-deuk (김시득)
*Grandson: Kim Am (also Gim Am, )

== Legacy ==
According to &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, Kim Yu-sin was a descendant of Shaohao.

Today, Kim Yu-sin is remembered by Koreans as one of the greatest generals in Korean history. His ultimate legacy is the first unification of the Korean nation. One of his ten children, his second son Kim Won-sul, became a general during the reign of King Munmu and was essential in unifying Silla.

Jincheon Gilsangsa is a shrine dedicated to his portrait in Jincheon-eup, Jincheon-gun, North Chungcheong Province.

<text>USS &quot;Barbel&quot; (SS-316), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the barbel, a fish commonly called a minnow or carp.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Barbel&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 14 November 1943 sponsored by Mrs. Harold A. Allen, and commissioned 3 April 1944.

==Service history==
&quot;Barbel&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 June 1944 and commenced preparation for her first war patrol. From 15 July 1944 to 4 February 1945, she carried out four war patrols and is officially credited with sinking six Japanese ships totaling 15,263 tons.

&quot;Barbel&quot; departed Fremantle submarine base, Western Australia, on 5 January 1945 for the South China Sea on her fourth patrol. Late in January she was ordered to form a &quot;wolfpack&quot; with and and patrol the western approaches to Balabac Strait and the southern entrance to the Palawan Passage. On 3 February, &quot;Barbel&quot; sent a message reporting that she had been attacked three times by enemy aircraft dropping depth charges and would transmit further information on the following night.

&quot;Barbel&quot; was never heard from again. Japanese aviators reported an attack on a submarine off southwest Palawan on 4 February. Two bombs were dropped and one landed on the submarine near the bridge. The sub plunged, under a cloud of fire and spray. This was very likely the last engagement of &quot;Barbel&quot;. She was officially reported lost on 16 February 1945.

==Awards==
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three battle stars for World War II service

==Memorials==
&quot;Barbel&quot; has a war memorial in the Oregon Trail Veterans Cemetery in Casper, Wyoming.

<text>Edenbridge is a town and civil parish in the Sevenoaks district of Kent, England. Its name derives from Old English &quot;Eadhelmsbrigge&quot; (meaning &quot;Eadhelm&#x27;s Bridge&quot;). It is located on the border of Kent and Surrey, on the upper floodplain of the River Medway and takes its name from that river&#x27;s tributary, the River Eden. The town had a population of 7,808 in 2011.

==History==

The old part of the town grew along a section of the otherwise disused Roman road, the London to Lewes Way at the point where it crossed the river. Iron slag from iron smelting in the surrounding area was used in building the road. In the Middle Ages it became a centre of the Wealden iron industry. There are many mediaeval timber buildings in the town, one of which houses the Eden Valley Museum.

With the coming of the railways the town expanded and the community of Marlpit Hill, north of the original settlement, is now part of the town.
After World War II, the London County Council built two modernist housing estates at Stangrove Park and Spitals Cross.

Owing to its position on the River Eden floodplain, the centre of the town is prone to severe flooding. The worst flood occurred in 1958, before any flood defences were built, and led to enormous damage to the High Street. Ten years later in 1968, despite the Eden having been dredged to prevent the same occurrence, the town was once again flooded after heavy storms in September. Although there were no fatalities, a helicopter was needed to save a man from his flooded home. Local legend has it that he hadn&#x27;t noticed the flood waters rising, having been too engrossed in &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; on television. More adequate flood defences have been built since then, with the local community now well prepared to deal with possible flooding. In December 2019 the town was &quot;paralysed&quot; when the river again burst its banks.

==Mills==
Edenbridge has had four mills over the centuries, Haxted Mill and Honour&#x27;s Mill on the River Eden, Christmas Mill on a tributary of the Eden, and a windmill to the south of the town. All four mill buildings survive, but now converted to other uses.

==Railways==
There are two railway stations serving Edenbridge. The earliest, on the South Eastern Railway (SER) route from Redhill to Tonbridge, was opened on 26 May 1842. The station, simply named Edenbridge, is located in Marlpit Hill. To the west of that station the route crosses what was once the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway main line from London to Tunbridge Wells and Eastbourne (via Lewes), opened on 2 January 1888. The crossing of the two lines takes place at a mid-break in the Edenbridge Tunnel on the SER line. The second station, named Edenbridge Town is about a mile South-east of this point. The line serving it is now truncated at Uckfield. There is no connection here between the two routes: Edenbridge is not a junction; one existed four miles (6 km) to the west of Edenbridge Town at Crowhurst, but that junction with the Oxted to East Grinstead line no longer exists. Severe damage to the embankments of both the SER line and the East Grinstead line occurred following the excessive rains in the winter of 2019/2020 but was repaired after extensive works by end of March 2020. 

All services at both stations are operated by Southern, which manages both stations.

Edenbridge Station is served by an hourly shuttle service (half-hourly during the peak periods) between and . Edenbridge Town Station is served by an hourly service (half-hourly during the peak periods) between and . On Sundays this service terminates at instead of London Bridge.

==Town==
Edenbridge is twinned with Mont-Saint-Aignan in France. The inner relief road that was built in the early 2000s to relieve traffic pressure on the old, narrow High Street is named Mont St Aignan Way. There are now no banks in the town, (just a mobile bank at the small Thursday market) a post office next to St Lawrence&#x27;s RC church and a number of major retail chains.

Despite being a relatively small town, Edenbridge still has its own small medical centre - The Edenbridge Memorial Health Centre. This replaced the separate minor injuries unit, the Edenbridge War Memorial Hospital (initially a cottage hospital built to care for soldiers returning from The First World War), and the GP surgery in 2023.

The Edenbridge Bonfire Society is to burn an effigy of former prime minister Liz Truss and a lettuce on a bonfire on Guy Fawkes Night 2022. The high effigy will hold a box with a copy of the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, referencing her record as the shortest-serving prime minister. The box will also contain a copy of her mini-budget, a T-shirt with the slogan &quot;I am a fighter, not a quitter&quot;, and a £115,00 cheque referring to the continual funding for ex-prime ministers.

==Parish and places of worship==

The 13th-century Anglican parish church of Church of St Peter and St Paul is a Grade I-listed building . It has a set of windows by Sir Edward Burne-Jones in the east wall. The church contains examples of medieval graffiti including ritual protection marks such as the VV symbol. A Baptist chapel on the High Street was registered for marriages in 1860. It was the home of the Edenbridge Baptist Church, which re-combined with its &#x27;daughter&#x27; church at Marlpit Hill in 2003 to form the Eden Church, which moved in 2013 to The Eden Centre. 

Roman Catholics worship at St Lawrence&#x27;s Church, registered in 1933.

Also in the parish is the hamlet of Marsh Green. Two places of worship are located here: St John&#x27;s United Reformed Church and a Kingdom Hall which serves the Oxted Congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. It was registered for marriages in 1999.

The Grade II-listed former Ebenezer Chapel, used by Independent Calvinists and later by Strict Baptists, stands on Edenbridge High Street. It is now a community café and meeting place In the Marlpit Hill area of the town, St Paulinus&#x27; Church Centre was used for worship and as a village hall, but has an uncertain future. Nearby, Marlpit Hill Baptist Church (built in the late 19th century) re-combined with its former parent (see above) to form the Eden Church and the building has been demolished to be replaced by housing.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and BBC London on BBC One &amp; ITV Meridian and ITV London on ITV1. Television signals are received from either the Tunbridge Wells or Crystal Palace TV transmitters. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Kent, Heart South, Gold and KMFM West Kent. 

Edenbridge is served by the local newspaper, Edenbridge Chronicle.

<doc id="429609" wikidata="Q315752" url="?curid=429609" title="John Frederic Daniell">
<text>John Frederic Daniell (12 March 1790 – 13 March 1845) was an English chemist and physicist.

==Biography==
Daniell was born in London. In 1831 he became the first professor of chemistry at the newly founded King&#x27;s College London; and in 1835 he was appointed to the equivalent post at the East India Company&#x27;s Military Seminary at Addiscombe, Surrey. His name is best known for his invention of the Daniell cell, an element of an electric battery much better than voltaic cells. He also invented the dew-point hygrometer known by his name, and a register pyrometer; and in 1830 he erected in the hall of the Royal Society a water-barometer, with which he carried out a large number of observations. A process devised by him for the manufacture of illuminating gas from turpentine and resin was in use in New York City for a time.

In 1842 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law by the University of Oxford.

==Publications==
Daniell&#x27;s publications included &quot;Meteorological Essays&quot; (1823), an &quot;Essay on Artificial Climate considered in its Applications to Horticulture&quot; (1824), which showed the necessity of a humid atmosphere in hothouses devoted to tropical plants, and an &quot;Introduction to the Study of Chemical Philosophy&quot; (1839).

==Lectures==
In 1840 he was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on &quot;The First Principles of Franklinic Electricity&quot;.

==Death and commemoration==
Daniell died suddenly of apoplexy in London in March 1845, while attending a meeting of the council of the Royal Society, of which he had become a fellow in 1813 and Foreign Secretary in 1839.

The lunar crater Daniell is named after him.

<doc id="429614" wikidata="Q1910200" url="?curid=429614" title="Leigong">
<text>Leigong () or Leishen (), is the god of thunder in Chinese folk religion, Chinese mythology and Taoism. In Taoism, when so ordered by heaven, Leigong punishes both earthly mortals guilty of secret crimes and evil spirits who have used their knowledge of Taoism to harm human beings. He carries a drum and mallet to produce thunder, and a chisel to punish evildoers. Leigong rides a chariot driven by a young boy named A Xiang.

Since Leigong&#x27;s power is thunder, he has assistants capable of producing other types of heavenly phenomena. Leigong&#x27;s wife Dianmu is the goddess of lightning, who is said to have used flashing mirrors to send bolts of lightning across the sky. Other companions are Yun Tong (&quot;Cloud Youth&quot;), who whips up clouds, and Yu Shi (&quot;Rain Master&quot;) who causes downpours by dipping his sword into a pot. Roaring winds rush forth from a type of goatskin bag manipulated by Fengbo (&quot;Earl of Wind&quot;), who was later transformed into Feng Po Po (&quot;Lady Wind&quot;).

==Iconography==

Leigong is depicted as a fearsome creature with claws, bat wings, and a blue face with a bird&#x27;s beak who wears only a loincloth. Temples dedicated to him are rare, but some people honor him in the hope that he will take revenge on their personal enemies. He used to smile a lot and also wore a friendly face. 

==Legend==
Leigong began life as a mortal. While on earth, he encountered a peach tree that originated from Heaven during the struggle between the Fox Demon and one of the Celestial Warriors. When Leigong took a bite out of one of its fruit he was transformed into his godly form. He soon received a mace and a hammer that could create thunder.
The Jade Emperor instructed Leigong to only kill bad people. But the sky got really dark whenever he struck people. So sometimes he killed the wrong people since he couldn&#x27;t find his quarry. Dianmu was one such victim of his blind fury. She lived with her mother in the countryside, where they worked as rice farmers. One day, she dumped a husk of rice into a river because it was too hard for her mother to eat. When Leigong witnessed this action, he became enraged as he thought she was wasting precious food, so when he saw her dumping the husk out he killed her with one of his lightning bolts. The Jade Emperor found out what Leigong had done and was furious that he killed the wrong person again. So the Jade Emperor revived Dianmu and made her into a goddess. He also told Dianmu to marry Leigong as punishment for her murder. He killed her, so it was his fault and his responsibility to take care of her. Dianmu&#x27;s job is to work with Leigong. She uses mirrors to shine light onto earth so Leigong can see who he hits and makes sure they aren&#x27;t innocent. This is why lightning comes first.

<doc id="429616" wikidata="Q596708" url="?curid=429616" title="Granisetron">
<text>Granisetron is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist used as an antiemetic to treat nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Its main effect is to reduce the activity of the vagus nerve, which is a nerve that activates the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata. It does not have much effect on vomiting due to motion sickness. This drug does not have any effect on dopamine receptors or muscarinic receptors.

Granisetron was developed by chemists working at the British drug company Beecham and is available as a generic. It is produced by Roche Laboratories under the trade name Kytril. The drug was approved in the United Kingdom in 1991 and in United States in 1994 by the FDA.

A granisetron transdermal patch with the trade name Sancuso was approved by the US FDA on September 12, 2008. Sancuso is manufactured by 3M Drug Delivery Systems for Kyowa Kirin, Inc.

It was patented in 1985 and approved for medical use in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==

===Chemotherapy===
It may be used for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and appears to work about the same as ondansetron. The most common side-effects of chemotherapy treatment are nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. This is one type of drug that a doctor can prescribe to prevent, lessen, or relieve discomfort.

===Post operative===
A number of medications including granisetron appear to be effective in controlling post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if it is more or less effective than other agents such as droperidol, metoclopramide, or ondansetron.

=== Gastroparesis ===
The granisetron patch (Sancuso) has been studied for use in gastroparesis, though it is not FDA approved for this indication.

===Other===
* Is a possible therapy for nausea and vomiting due to acute or chronic medical illness or acute gastroenteritis
* Treatment of cyclic vomiting syndrome although there are no formal trials to confirm efficacy.

==Adverse effects==
Granisetron is a well-tolerated drug with few side effects. Headache, dizziness, and constipation are the most commonly reported side effects associated with its use. There have been no significant drug interactions reported with this drug&#x27;s use. It is broken down by the liver&#x27;s cytochrome P450 system and it has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system.

==Extended release==

An extended release injectable version of granisetron, known as Sustol is also available in the United States as of 2016. The long acting form is used for the treatment of both acute and delayed CINV in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and anthrocycline and/or cyclophosphamide (AC) highly emetogenic regimens. In its review, the FDA did not grant the broad HEC label to the drug citing the focus on AC regimens, primarily breast-cancer, and lack of data.

<doc id="429618" wikidata="Q3042818" url="?curid=429618" title="Empirical orthogonal functions">
<text>In statistics and signal processing, the method of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is a decomposition of a signal or data set in terms of orthogonal basis functions which are determined from the data. The term is also interchangeable with the geographically weighted Principal components analysis in geophysics.

The &quot;i&quot; th basis function is chosen to be orthogonal to the basis functions from the first through &quot;i&quot; − 1, and to minimize the residual variance. That is, the basis functions are chosen to be different from each other, and to account for as much variance as possible.

The method of EOF analysis is similar in spirit to harmonic analysis, but harmonic analysis typically uses predetermined orthogonal functions, for example, sine and cosine functions at fixed frequencies. In some cases the two methods may yield essentially the same results.

The basis functions are typically found by computing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data set. A more advanced technique is to form a kernel out of the data, using a fixed kernel. The basis functions from the eigenvectors of the kernel matrix are thus non-linear in the location of the data (see Mercer&#x27;s theorem and the kernel trick for more information).

<doc id="429620" wikidata="Q2184252" url="?curid=429620" title="Ox-Head and Horse-Face">
<text>Ox-Head () and Horse-Face () are two guardians or types of guardians of the underworld in Chinese mythology. As indicated by their names, both have the bodies of men, but Ox-Head has the head of an ox while Horse-Face has the face of a horse. They are the first beings a dead soul encounters upon entering the underworld; in many stories they directly escort the newly dead to the underworld.

==Role==

In their duties as guardians of Diyu, the realm of the dead, their role is to capture human souls who have reached the end of their earthly existence and bring them before the courts of Hell. Souls are then rewarded or punished based on the actions performed in their lifetime.

Ox-Head and Horse-Face also play the role of messengers of the king of hell, Yanluo Wang (閻羅王). In one legend, Ox-Head was created by the king when he took pity on a recently deceased ox who had worked hard all his life, so the king made him one of his faithful servants.

== Chinese mythology ==
In the Chinese classical novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Ox-Head and Horse-Face are among the underworld denizens overpowered by Sun Wukong after his soul is dragged to hell in his sleep. He then crosses out his name and those of all non-human primates on earth from the record of living souls, hence granting a second level of immortality to himself and general immortality to his monkey children.

== Japanese mythology ==
In Japanese mythology, Ox-Head and Horse-Face are known as &quot;Gozu&quot; and &quot;Mezu&quot; respectively. They appear in classical Japanese literature such as the &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot; and &quot;Taiheiki&quot;. In &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, they appear in an ominous dream of Taira no Tokiko.
== Vietnamese mythology ==

In Vietnamese mythology, the Ox-Head and Horse-Face are called &quot;Đầu Trâu&quot; and &quot;Mặt Ngựa&quot; or &quot;Ngưu Đầu&quot; and &quot;Mã Diện&quot;. They are also responsible for leading people&#x27;s souls to the underworld after death.

<doc id="429623" wikidata="Q184445" url="?curid=429623" title="County Offaly">
<text>County Offaly (; ) is a county in Ireland. It is part of the Eastern and Midland Region and the province of Leinster. It is named after the ancient Kingdom of Uí Failghe. It was formerly known as King&#x27;s County, in honour of Philip II of Spain. Offaly County Council is the local authority for the county. The county population was 82,668 at the 2022 census.

== Geography and political subdivisions ==
Offaly is the 18th largest of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties by area and the 24th largest in terms of population. It is the fifth largest of Leinster&#x27;s 12 counties by size and the tenth largest by population.

=== Physical geography ===

Tullamore is the county town and largest town in Offaly and is the 30th largest in Ireland. Offaly borders seven counties: Galway, Roscommon, Tipperary, Laois, Westmeath, Kildare and Meath. The Slieve Bloom Mountains are in the southern part of the county on the border with County Laois. Offaly has the 24th-highest county peak in Ireland. The highest point is Arderin () in the Slieve Blooms at . The Slieve Bloom Mountains contain the county&#x27;s highest points including Stillbrook Hill and Wolftrap Mountain which are, respectively, the county&#x27;s second- and third-highest peaks. Croghan Hill rises from the Bog of Allen and is located in northern Offaly. Although only high, it is known for its view over the surrounding area and it stands out by itself.

The floodplain of the River Shannon is in the north-western part of the county. The River Camcor, a Wild Trout Conservation Area, runs through the town of Birr where it joins the Little Brosna River. The River Brosna runs across the county from Lough Owel in Westmeath to Shannon Harbour. Silver River runs through several towns in the south of the county before joining Brosna near the town of Ferbane. The Grand Canal also runs across the county from Edenderry on the north-east to Shannon Harbour before joining the Shannon. The county contains many small lakes from Lough Boora to Pallas Lake and it also contains of swamp land. There are a number of eskers in the county&#x27;s landscape including Esker Riada.

Offaly largely comprises a flat landscape and is known for its extensive bog and peatlands. There are many large bogs in Offaly including the Bog of Allen, Clara Bog, Boora Bog and Raheenmore Bog which are spread out across the county with the Bog of Allen extending into four other counties. The county consists of approximately of peatland which is 21% of Offaly&#x27;s total land area.

Offaly contains approximately of forest and woodland area, which only amounts to 4.5% of the county&#x27;s land area. This includes woodlands within the Slieve Blooms and the Lough Boora Parklands. Roughly 75% of Offaly&#x27;s forested area is conifer high forest.

==Local government and politics==

Offaly County Council is the local authority for the county. The council is responsible for local services such as housing policy, social and cultural services, economic development and planning, motor taxation and infrastructural policy in the county.

Under the Local Government Reform Act 2014 the number of councillors was reduced to 19 from 21. The reforms also reduced the number of electoral areas to three: Tullamore (7 members), Birr (6 members) and Edenderry (6 members).

Until the 2011 general election Offaly was part of the Laois–Offaly constituency which elected five TDs to the Dáil. Between 1921 and 2011 this consisted of the full territory of both counties. For the 2011 general election, some electoral divisions in South Offaly were part of Tipperary North.

The Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Act 2013 established a new constituency called Offaly for the 2016 general election. The constituency incorporates all of Offaly from the previous Laois–Offaly constituency, and 24 electoral divisions from Tipperary North. This constituency elected three TDs to the Dáil. It was abolished in 2020.

Laois–Offaly became a five-seat constituency again for the 2020 general election.

The Constituency Review Report 2023 proposed the establishment of a three-seat Offaly constituency comprising solely the county of Offaly. This change will come into effect for the 34th Dáil.

==History==

One of the earliest known settlements in County Offaly is at Boora Bog which dates back to the Mesolithic era. Excavations here provide evidence of a temporary settlement as no structures were found at the site. Stone axes, arrowheads and blades were discovered which date to between 6,800 and 6,000 BCE.

The Dowris Hoard dating from the Late Bronze Age was found in a bog at Dowris, Whigsborough near Birr. It is the largest collection of Bronze Age objects ever found in Ireland.

After Christianisation, the monastic complex of Clonmacnoise was erected at the River Shannon near Shannonbridge. It is today a significant tourist destination.

The county itself was formed following the Tudor plantations of Laois and Offaly in an attempt by the Roman Catholic English Crown under Queen Mary I to expand its sphere of influence in Ireland which had declined following the Norman Conquest of Ireland. Both Laois (Leix) and Offaly (Uí Failghe) were petty kingdoms in Gaelic Ireland located just outside the Pale (a region around Dublin and the mid-east of Ireland that remained loyal to the English Crown following the Norman Conquest). The older kingdoms of Leix and Uí Failghe are not coterminous with the present-day counties that were formed. The Kingdom of Uí Failghe, from which the name Offaly is derived, was ruled by the Ó Conchobhair Failghe (anglicised as O&#x27;Conor Faly) whose territory extended from the east of the county into north Kildare. The Kingdom of Firceall ruled by the O&#x27;Molloy clan constituted much of the centre of the county. The Kingdom of Firceall was part of the Kingdom of Meath while Uí Failghe was part of the Kingdom of Leinster. Much of the south of the present-day county (as well as northern County Tipperary) was ruled by Ó Cearbhaill of Éile (anglicised as O&#x27;Carroll Ely). Ely formed part of the Kingdom of Munster. These petty kingdoms were swept aside by the Tudor plantations. The Settlement of Laois and Offaly 1556, an Act of the Parliament of Ireland, created &quot;King&#x27;s County&quot;, named after Philip, the then-king of Ireland. This replaced the old kingdoms with baronies and the present-day County System.

Although the county is named Offaly in the Local Government Act 2001, no legislation was ever enacted after independence explicitly changing the name from King&#x27;s County, the name formally established under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, which continued to have legal effect. Legal transfers and assignments of land in the county still refer to it as &quot;King&#x27;s County&quot;.

==Places of interest==

==Demographics==
The 2006 population figure for County Offaly was the highest for the county since 1881. The Central Statistics Office estimates that the increase in population between 2002 and 2006 (7,205) comprised a natural increase of 2,026 people with the balance of 5,179 accounted for by net in-migration from within Ireland as well as abroad. The population increased by 11.3% between 2002 and 2006 which was a greater rate than the national average rate of 8.2%. This may be attributed to the county&#x27;s proximity to the Greater Dublin Area, increased accessibility to Dublin (M6, M7, and improved rail services) and lower house prices than in Dublin.

The population of many towns rose during the period 1996 to 2006: Birr +21.5%, Tullamore +28.8% and Edenderry +53.9%. The population of Portarlington increased by 50.1% between 2002 and 2006.

The population as of census 2016 was 77,961 people with 34.7% (27,085 people) under the age of 25 and 13.6% (10,951 people) over the age of 65.

==Economy==

Traditionally, agriculture and industry have been the main driving force of the economy in the county. Offaly has extensive bogland, particularly in the northern parts of the county, that forms part of the Bog of Allen. Bord na Móna was founded in 1946 and provided employment to hundreds of people in Offaly by making peat briquettes (for home domestic use) and supplying peat to power stations operated by ESB. Peat briquettes were made at the Bord na Móna Derrinlough briquette factory near Birr. Power stations are operating at Shannonbridge and Edenderry. With the continuing depletion of the bogs, a number of power stations have closed down in recent years. The ESB power station at Lumcloon, Ferbane was a major employer in the midlands but closed in 2001. Rhode power station closed down soon afterwards. These were major landmarks in Offaly with large cooling towers that were visible for miles around Offaly and beyond, but were demolished soon after the stations closed. Many bogs are now used as wildlife reserves or for tourism activities such as Lough Boora.

The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century brought prosperity to towns such as Banagher and Tullamore. Both towns were important stops on the Dublin to Limerick navigation which supported a number of industries and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the county in that era.

The Celtic Tiger also brought an increase in economic activity to Offaly with business enterprise and industrial parks opening in Birr, Edenderry and Tullamore. Many people particularly in the east of the county are within an easy commuting distance to Dublin where many find employment.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===
====Rail====

North Offaly is well served by rail transport. Railway stations are located at Tullamore and Clara. Both stations are on the main Dublin–Westport/Galway railway line with regular trains serving the area, especially for Dublin commuters. Portarlington railway station is located just over the County Laois border and is in a catchment area for the southeast of the county. Portarlington railway station is on the main Dublin–Cork railway line with regular commuter services to Heuston Station, Dublin and intercity services to Cork, Limerick, Killarney and Tralee. The southern and western baronies of Garrycastle, Ballyboy, Eglish, Ballybritt, and Clonlisk have no train stations. The majority of the baronies of Eglish and Ballybritt have a more than 25-minute drive to the nearest train station, be it Clara, Tullamore, or Ballybrophy in neighbouring Laois.

The Limerick-Ballybrophy railway line travels through the south of the county, which has no railway stations. The nearest are at Cloughjordan and Roscrea, both just outside the county boundary. A railway line from Birr connected to the line at Roscrea until it was closed in the 1960s. A controversial railway line also connected Birr to Portumna between 1868 and 1878 and became something of a folk legend.

====Road====

Three main national secondary routes pass through the county. The N52 road passes from Kilbeggan to Tullamore and Birr which then continues to Nenagh where it intersects with the M7. The N62 from Athlone passes through Ferbane and Birr and continues onto Roscrea and Thurles. The N80 route starts in Tullamore and continues to the southeast passing through Portlaoise and Carlow. There are no main national primary routes in the county; the M6 skirts it to the north and the M7 to the south through Moneygall. Road infrastructure has improved with the completion of the Tullamore bypass in 2009 and improved access to regional cities following the completion of the intercity motorway network.

====Bus====
Bus Éireann provide public transport services throughout the county with regular bus services to Limerick and Waterford from Athlone bus station. Other private bus coach services provide direct bus services from Birr to Dublin such as Kearns bus service which run several services daily. Slieve Bloom Coaches run services from Tullamore and Portarlington to Dublin.
====Waterway====
The Grand Canal connecting Dublin to the river Shannon was constructed through the towns of Edenderry and Tullamore and joins the Shannon at Shannon Harbour. Traditionally this was an important route for transport, communication and trade between Dublin, Limerick and the midlands of Ireland. The route fell into decline as road transport became more popular. Much of the route is now used for boating and leisure activities.

===Media===
====Radio====
Midlands 103 (originally Midlands Radio 3) which broadcasts to Laois, Offaly and Westmeath is based in Tullamore and has studios across the midlands.
RTÉ&#x27;s medium-wave transmitter broadcasting RTÉ Radio 1 was also located in Tullamore but transmission stopped in 2008.

====Print====
A number of local newspapers are published in Offaly. The &quot;Offaly Independent&quot; and &quot;Tullamore Tribune&quot; are based in Tullamore. The &quot;Midland Tribune&quot;, based in Birr, covers local news in the west and south of the county as well as parts of northern Tipperary including the towns of Birr, Roscrea and Nenagh and surrounding areas. The &quot;Offaly Express&quot; was a former newspaper based in Tullamore. It closed down in July 2012 after 29 years in operation. It is now an online news platform for the county.

==Sport==
===GAA===

Gaelic games are popular. Offaly GAA has 44 clubs in various communities, contesting the traditional sports of football and hurling. The town of Birr is a hurling stronghold, with its local club having won four All-Ireland Club SHC titles in the 1990s and 2000s. Coolderry (2011) and Kilcormac–Killoughey (2012) are other clubs in the west of the county to have had success in the Leinster Club SHC.

County teams have also achieved national recognition in both hurling and football, winning the Liam MacCarthy Cup four times and the Sam Maguire Cup three times. The football team is remembered for Séamus Darby&#x27;s goal in the dying minutes of the 1982 All-Ireland SFC final, when Offaly took the title by one point and denied opponent Kerry what would have been a historic (having never before occurred, and not occurring until 2019) five consecutive titles.

===Association football===
Tullamore Town F.C. play at Leah Victoria Park. Previously they played in the A Championship and League of Ireland B Division

===Other sports===
Other popular sports in the county include rugby and golf. Birr Golf Club and Esker Hills Golf Club near Tullamore are popular. Irish golfer Shane Lowry is a member of Esker Hills. He is from the town of Clara outside Tullamore. As an amateur, he won the 2009 Irish Open. In 2019, Lowry won The Open Championship in Royal Portrush Golf Club, becoming the first Offaly man to win one of the golfing majors.

<text>Ask.com (known originally as Ask Jeeves) is an internet-based business with a question answering format initiated during 1996 by Garrett Gruener and David Warthen in Berkeley, California.

The original software was implemented by Gary Chevsky, from his own design. Warthen, Chevsky, Justin Grant, and others built the early AskJeeves.com website based on that core program. In 2006, the &quot;Jeeves&quot; name was discontinued and they emphasized use of the search engine, which had its own algorithm. In late 2010, with insurmountable competition from more popular search engines like Google, the company outsourced its web search technology and revived its function as a question and answer site. The business&#x27;s president, Douglas Leeds became CEO in 2010.

Three venture capital companies, Highland Capital Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, and The RODA Group were early investors. Ask.com is owned currently by InterActiveCorp (IAC), using the Nasdaq symbol , and its corporate headquarters is located at 555 City Center, in the Oakland City Center development in downtown Oakland, California.

==History==

Ask.com was originally known as Ask Jeeves, &quot;Jeeves&quot; being the name of a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s personal gentleman&quot;, or valet, fetching answers to any question asked. The character was named after Jeeves, Bertie Wooster&#x27;s valet in the fictional works of P. G. Wodehouse.

The original idea of Ask Jeeves was to allow users to get answers to questions in everyday, natural language, and traditional keyword searching. The current Ask.com still provides this for mathematics, dictionary, and conversion questions.

Ask Jeeves was initiated as a beta version during mid-April 1997 and was initiated completely on June 1, 1997.

On September 18, 2001, Ask Jeeves acquired Teoma for more than $1.5 million.

In July 2005, Ask Jeeves was acquired by IAC.

In February 2006, the name &quot;Jeeves&quot; was eliminated from Ask Jeeves and the search engine renamed Ask.

On May 16, 2006, Ask implemented a &quot;Binoculars Site Preview&quot; into its search results. On search results pages, the &quot;binoculars&quot; let searchers have a preview of the page they could visit with a mouse-over activating a pop-up screenshot.

On June 5, 2007, Ask.com was redesigned with a 3D appearance.

In December 2007, Ask released the AskEraser feature, allowing users to opt-out from tracking of search queries and IP and cookie values. They also announced they would erase this data after 18 months if the AskEraser option was not set. HTTP cookies must be enabled for AskEraser to function.
On July 4, 2008, Ask acquired Lexico Publishing Group, which owns Dictionary.com, Thesaurus.com, and Reference.com.

In August 2008, Ask initiated the Ask Kids search engine designed for children.

In April 2009, for the UK version of Ask.com, Jeeves was redesigned as a CGI character and the website was named once again Ask Jeeves, though international versions were still just Ask.com. His image remained on the UK website until July 21, 2016, though the Ask Jeeves name would continue to be used until September 21, 2016, when the website was renamed Ask.

On July 26, 2010, Ask.com released a closed-beta Q&amp;A service. The service was released to the public on July 29, 2010. Ask.com initiated its mobile Q&amp;A application for the iPhone during late 2010.

Ask.com reached 100 million global users per month in 2012 through its website with more than 2 million downloads of its flagship mobile app in that year. The company has also released additional applications developed from its Q&amp;A experience, including Ask Around in 2011 and PollRoll in 2012.

===Search engine shut-down===
In 2010, Ask.com discontinued the search function, with the loss of 130 search engineering jobs, because it could not compete against more popular search engines such as Google. Earlier in the year, Ask had initiated a Q&amp;A community for generating answers from real people as opposed to search algorithms, then combined this with its question-and–answer repository, utilizing its extensive history of archived query data to search sites that provide answers to questions people have.

To avoid a situation in which no answers were available from its own resources, the company outsourced to an unnamed third-party search provider the comprehensive web search matches that it had gathered itself.

===Ask Sponsored Listings===
Ask Sponsored Listings, formerly the direct-sales division for Ask.com, is no longer available, having merged with Sendori, an operating business of IAC, in 2011.

==Corporate details==

Ask Jeeves, Inc. stock traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange from July 1999 to July 2005, using the ticker symbol ASKJ. In July 2005, the ASKJ ticker was retired upon the acquisition by IAC, valued at US$1.85 billion.

In 2012, Ask.com made two acquisitions as part of a larger strategy to offer more content on the Ask.com website. On July 2, 2012, Ask.com purchased content discovery start-up nRelate for an undisclosed amount. That was followed by the company&#x27;s acquisition of expert advice and information site About.com, which closed in September 2012.

On August 14, 2014, Ask.com acquired popular social networking website ASKfm, where users can ask other users questions, with the option of anonymity. As of August 14, 2014, Ask.fm had 180 million monthly unique users in more than 150 countries, with its largest user base in the United States. Available on the web and as a mobile app, ASKfm generates an estimated 20,000 questions per minute with approximately 45 percent of its mobile monthly active users logging in daily. , the mobile app has been downloaded more than 40 million times.

In 2021, Ask re-initiated its function &quot;SymptomFind&quot; and introduced the new finance-based site &quot;Ask Money&quot;.

==Marketing and promotion==
From November 1999, in some areas Ask Jeeves advertised on produce stickers on apples, oranges and bananas. Questions such as &quot;How many calories in a banana?&quot; were printed alongside the Ask Jeeves web address.

A Jeeves balloon and a float appeared in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade during 2000–2004.

Apostolos Gerasoulis, the co-creator of Ask&#x27;s Teoma algorithmic search technology, featured in four television advertisements in 2007, extolling the virtues of Ask.com&#x27;s usefulness for information relevance.

After a hiatus from mass consumer marketing, Ask reinstated its website&#x27;s format to emphasize questions and answers, and resumed advertising by television during the autumn of 2011. Instead of national advertising, Ask emphasized local markets. During the summer of 2012, initiated a national cinema campaign, along with other out-of-home tactics in certain markets such as New York and Seattle.

As part of a Seattle-based local market effort, Ask.com initiated its campaign &quot;You Asked We Answered&quot; during 2012, in which the company &quot;answered&quot; residents&#x27; main complaints about living in their city, including easing morning commutes and stadium traffic, as well as keeping the local Parks and Recreation department&#x27;s wading pools open.

On January 14, 2009, Ask.com became the official sponsor of 2000 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion Bobby Labonte&#x27;s No. 96 Ford. Ask would become the official search engine of NASCAR. Ask.com was the primary sponsor for the No. 96 for 18 of the first 21 races and had rights to increase this to a total of 29 races that season. The Ask.com car debuted in the 2009 Bud Shootout where it failed to finish the race, but subsequently returned strongly, placing as high as 5th in a March 1, 2009, Shelby 427 race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Ask.com&#x27;s foray into NASCAR represented the first instance of its venture into what it terms &quot;Super Verticals&quot;.

<text>The Ford Köln is an automobile that was produced by Ford Germany from 1933 until 1936 at its Cologne plant.

==Origins==
The English Ford company had developed the car and introduced it in 1932 as the Ford Model Y. The German-built version, renamed Ford Köln to stress the vehicle&#x27;s German provenance, was first seen at the 1933 Berlin Motor Show. The name came from the German name for the city of Cologne. The early cars were built with components and other support from the company&#x27;s English associate, but during the first year of production componentry was increasingly sourced locally.

==Evolution==
Subsequently, the German company offered alternative bodied cars of its own design, including notably, for 1934/35, a cheap open topped &quot;Cabrio-Limousine&quot; that used timber-frame construction with synthetic leather covering after the manner of some of the smaller DKWs and Adlers. This bargain basement special was promoted as a &quot;car for everyman&quot; (&quot;Wagen für Jedermann&quot;) and priced in 1935 at 1,850 Marks, which was 360 Marks less than the manufacturer&#x27;s advertised price for the normally bodied two-door sedan/saloon.

==Technical specification==
The Köln had a four-cylinder, four-stroke engine of 933 cc giving 21 hp (16 kW) at 3400 rpm. The top speed was . It had a three-speed gearbox (plus reverse) with synchromesh on second and third gear. It was a small car weighing, in bare chassis form, only : an empty car with a body fitted weighed between and .

==Commercial==
Public response to the car was lukewarm due to a rigid axle based front suspension and a perpendicular body style which was by now perceived as old fashioned. In its class the car faced heavy competition, mainly from Opel, DKW and Adler: commercially the Ford Köln, with 11,121 cars produced between 1933 and 1936, was not a great success. Adler produced 24,013 of their similarly sized Trumpf Juniors in less than two years between 1934 and 1935. Ford Köln volumes were also disappointing when compared with the 153,117 produced by Ford of Britain of the equivalent model.

In 1935 the Ford Köln was replaced by the Ford Eifel which was a larger car (based on the British Model C).

<doc id="429630" wikidata="Q988970" url="?curid=429630" title="Ellesmere, Shropshire">
<text>Ellesmere ( ) is a town in the civil parish of Ellesmere Urban, in Shropshire, England; it is located near to the Welsh border, the towns of Oswestry and Whitchurch, and the Welsh city of Wrexham. It is notable for its proximity to a number of prominent meres.

==History==
Ellesmere Castle was probably an 11th-century motte-and-bailey castle most likely built by either Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, or his son Roger the Poitevin at Castlefields overlooking the Mere. Only its earthworks now remain, with the top of the motte being used for the bowling green, which still commands a fine view.

In 1114, King Henry I gave Ellesmere to William Peverel as a part of the Maelor, which included Overton and Whittington at that time. His descendants retained Ellesmere until apparently the late 1140s when the lordship was acquired, probably by force, by Madog ap Maredudd of Powys. Madog died in 1160 and Ellesmere came into the hands of King Henry II.

In 1177 King Henry II gave the manors of Ellesmere and Hales in England to Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd (who already had a castle at Rhuddlan and was, by this time, the sole ruler of Gwynedd. Earlier, in the summer of 1174, Dafydd had married Emme of Anjou, half sister of Henry, and sister of Hamelin de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, both illegitimate children of Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou). Dafydd remained Lord of Ellesmere until his death in 1203.

In mid-April 1205, Llywelyn the Great married Joan, Lady of Wales illegitimate daughter of King John and Ellesmere was given to them as a wedding gift. Llywelyn&#x27;s mother was Marared (Margaret), daughter of Madog ap Maredudd, Prince of Powys. There is evidence that, after her first husband Iorwerth&#x27;s death, Marared married in the summer of 1197, Gwion, the nephew of Roger Powys of Whittington Castle. She seems to have pre-deceased her husband, after bearing him a son, David ap Gwion, and therefore there can be no truth in the story that she later married into the Corbet family of Caus Castle (near Westbury, Shropshire) and later, Moreton Corbet Castle. Ellesmere was ordered to be attacked by King Henry III in 1231, but Llywelyn retained control of the lordship until his death in 1240. In 1241 King Henry III ordered John le Strange to repair the wooden castle of Ellesmere.

The lordship appears to have later passed into the hands of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd or his brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd, grandsons of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth and last of the native Princes of Wales. The castle fell to royal troops from Chester during March 1282.

In 1287, Oliver Ingham, who was an English commander and administrator in Aquitaine during the War of Saint-Sardos and early Hundred Years War was born in Ellesmere and granted custody of Ellesmere Castle in 1321. His daughter Joan married Robert (&quot;Roger&quot;) le Strange, 4th Baron Strange, son of Lord Strange of Knockin and Isolda de Walton.

By 1294, the preceptory of Dolgynwal (Ysbyty Ifan, Denbighshire, on the banks of the River Conwy) had been united with Halston, which was subsequently the administrative centre for all Knights Hospitaller estates in North Wales. Dolgynwal, which had been founded c. 1190, had acquired Ellesmere Church, its most substantial property, from Llywelyn the Great in 1225

In 1435, Griffin Kynaston, Seneschal of the Lordship of Ellesmere, (born at Stocks of landed gentry – descended from the princes of Powys), gave evidence at Shrewsbury to confirm the age of John Burgh, Lord of Mowthey, sponsored by Lord John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, Lieutenant of Ireland. Griffin&#x27;s fourth son, Sir Roger Kynaston, was appointed for life as Escheator and Sheriff of Merioneth and became Constable of Harlech Castle and Sheriff of Shropshire. Humphrey Kynaston, the son of Roger and his second wife Elizabeth Grey was, in 1491, declared an outlaw by King Henry VII and took shelter in a cave in the west point of Nesscliffe Rock, called to this day &quot;Kynaston&#x27;s Cave&quot;. He was pardoned in 1493.

The former Marcher Lordship of Ellesmere (formerly a Hundred in its own right) was annexed to Shropshire and the Hundred of Pymhill by section 11 of the Laws in Wales Act 1535.

Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere, was born Lord Francis Leveson-Gower, in London in 1800. A patron of the arts, in 1848 he purchased at auction for 355 guineas from the estate of Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, the only known (or suspected) portrait of William Shakespeare in existence. Ellesmere Island in Canada was named after him.

In 1891 the civil parish had a population of 5507. In 1894 the parish was abolished and split to form &quot;Ellesmere Urban&quot; and &quot;Ellesmere Rural&quot;.

There was a tannery located on the edge of the Mere in what is now known as Cremorne Gardens. These gardens were given to the people of Ellesmere by Lord Brownlow who was heavily involved in the Edward VIII abdication crisis of 1936.

==Commerce==
North Shropshire and the Cheshire Plain has always been a region well suited to dairy produce, and Ellesmere was a thriving market town with several fairs during the year in which dairy produce and livestock were sold. The Shrewsbury to Wrexham turnpike road, passing through Ellesmere, was created in 1752 which used tolls to maintain the road, and so improved transport. Later turnpike roads connected Ellesmere to Whitchurch and Oswestry. The opportunities for trade further increased from 1805 when Ellesmere gained its canal connection to Ellesmere Port and hence to the port of Liverpool, where ships sailed to all parts of the world. In 1806 a July Fair was introduced (in addition to the regular fairs in February, April, August and November) this being for the sale of &quot;horned cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, leather, grain, butter, cheese, wool, bacon, hops, and every other produce of land&quot;. The Ellesmere Canal was said to offer speedy and safe conveyance to Chester, Liverpool, Manchester, etc., and North Wales, with the Earl of Bridgewater erecting wharves and warehouses on the canal. The canal gave access to bulky materials, such as timbers for building, iron, and coal, and allowed the building of an adjacent gas works. At the head of the canal was an iron foundry, Bridgewater Foundry, which manufactured agricultural implements and also some of the ironwork required by the canal.

In 1863 Ellesmere gained railway access when the new line arrived from Whitchurch. In July 1864 the extension of the line to Oswestry was completed, and in 1895 the line opened from Ellesmere to Wrexham. The station had a large goods yard, and a siding to a livestock dock. A new cattle market was opened adjacent to the cattle dock in December 1869.

In particular the Ellesmere area was known for its cheese making, and a considerable proportion of Cheshire cheese was made in North Shropshire. In 1909, following the death of its owner, William Clay, the foundry was closed and the works auctioned. This location was later to become the site for a cheese factory which by the 1930s was the largest employer in Ellesmere. The cheese factory continued as a major employer until its closure in January 1987, with the loss of 329 jobs.

==Geography==

The town is located by the side of Ellesmere (aka &#x27;the Mere&#x27;), one of the largest natural meres in England outside the Lake District and one of nine glacial meres in the area. (&#x27;glacial&#x27; means that the depression occupied by the mere was the location of a block of ice that persisted at the end of the last ice age). These meres are different from those in the Lake District in that they do not have a flow of water into them to maintain the level.

An artificial island in the Mere was constructed in 1812 from soil dug out during the making of the gardens at Ellesmere House. This was later named &quot;Moscow Island&quot;, as Napoleon was forced to retreat from Moscow that year. The Mere has a visitors&#x27; centre and is popular with birdwatchers, many of whom visit to see grey herons nesting. There are eight other meres nearby: Blakemere, Colemere, Crosemere, Kettlemere, Newtonmere, Whitemere, Sweatmere and Hanmer Mere.

The civil parish which constitutes the town is Ellesmere Urban; the surrounding parish, covering a large rural area, is Ellesmere Rural.
==Transport==
The A495 and A528 roads cross at Ellesmere. The latter runs 15 miles south-southeast from Ellesmere to the county town, Shrewsbury.

The town lies beside the Llangollen Canal with a short side arm reaching the town centre wharf. The canal eventually terminates just outside Llangollen at Llantysilio after passing through the 18 km World Heritage Site which includes Chirk Aqueduct and Pontcysyllte Aqueduct. It was originally known as the Ellesmere Canal. Thomas Telford was overall director of its construction. Work lasted from 1793 to 1805 with the aim of linking Chester on the River Dee and the River Mersey at Ellesmere Port (named after the town) with Shrewsbury, but it never got that far due to rising costs and completion of alternative routes which later became the Shropshire Union Canal. During its construction, Telford lived in a house next to the canal in Ellesmere, which still stands today.

Ellesmere no longer has a railway, but it was once on the Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway main line of the Cambrian Railways. However, the section from Whitchurch to Welshpool (Buttington Junction), via Ellesmere, Whittington, Oswestry and Llanymynech, closed on 18 January 1965 in favour of the more viable alternative route via Shrewsbury. Ellesmere was also the terminus of the Wrexham and Ellesmere Railway branch line to Wrexham (Central), via Overton-on-Dee, Bangor-on-Dee and Marchwiel. This line closed on 10 September 1962. Ellesmere railway station still stands albeit derelict and disused. The nearest active station to Ellesmere is Gobowen for Oswestry which is about 8 miles away.

Bus services are operated by Arriva Midlands, Lakeside Coaches and Tanat Valley Coaches. The main services are as follows:
*53 to Oswestry via Dudleston Heath, St. Martin&#x27;s, Gobowen and the Orthopaedic Hospital – every 40 minutes Monday to Saturday (Arriva Midlands);
*205 Town Service (Tuesdays and Fridays) (Lakeside Coaches)
*449 to Oswestry via Welsh Frankton and Whittington – roughly hourly Monday – Saturday, with 3 journeys daily continuing from Ellesmere to Welshampton (Lakeside Coaches, with Arriva Midlands operating the three Welshampton services: one in the morning and two in the evening);
*501 to Shrewsbury via Cockshutt, Myddle (most but not all) and Harmer Hill – roughly hourly (Lakeside coaches).

==Landmarks==
*St Mary&#x27;s Church – of Norman origin but largely rebuilt by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1849. A grade I listed building.
*The Old Town Hall – Ellesmere&#x27;s most notable building, built in 1833. A grade II listed building.

==Education==
The town has two schools. Ellesmere Primary School is a primary and nursery school for boys and girls aged 4–11. In 2013 Lakelands School became an academy. Lakelands Academy provides state-paid education for boys and girls in the 11–16 age range (for whom schooling is compulsory) and its former pupils include Luke Preston. Several other nearby schools serve the wider community, such as Welshampton Church of England School.

A short distance outside the town is Ellesmere College, a public (i.e., private) boarding school founded in 1884 by Canon Nathaniel Woodard for sons of the middle classes. It is now a fully co-educational school catering for pupils from 7–18.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Wrekin TV transmitters. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Shropshire, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, Smooth West Midlands, Heart West Midlands, and Capital North West and Wales. &quot;The Border Counties Advertizer&quot; and &quot;Shropshire Star&quot; are the town&#x27;s local newspapers. 

==Sport==
The town also has a semi-professional football club, Ellesmere Rangers FC, who play their home games at Beech Grove. They are currently members of the North West Counties Football League Division One South, the 10th tier of the English football pyramid.

The town’s cricket club has teams represented in the Shropshire County Cricket league, with the first XI being in division one and the second XI being in division 6.

==Twin cities==
Ellesmere is twinned with Diksmuide, Belgium.

<text>Cats Protection, formerly the Cats Protection League, is a UK charity dedicated to rescuing and rehoming stray, unwanted or homeless cats and educating people about cats and cat welfare. The organization was founded as the Cats Protection League by Jessey Wade and others in 1927. The name was shortened in 1998. The current Chief Executive is John May.

==History==

The Cats Protection League was formed at a meeting in Caxton Hall on the 16 May of 1927 under the chairmanship of Jessey Wade. The League was launched under the auspices of the Animals&#x27; Friend Society and from the work of M. Dudley Ward. Amongst those present at the formation meeting were M. Dudley Ward, Jessey Wade, Charles Forward and Mrs Avery. Ernest Bell was made Treasurer and Mrs Avery Honorary Secretary. The first headquarters of the Cats Protection League were located at the Animals&#x27; Friend&#x27;s Office at York House, Portugal Street in London. The aims of the League were to prevent the suffering of strays and provide suitable homes for cats during the absence of their owners.

In 1931 the League launched its magazine, &quot;The Cats’ Mews-Sheet&quot;. It was renamed &quot;The Cat&quot; in 1934.

==Aims==
* To find good homes for cats in need
* To support and encourage the neutering of cats
* To improve people&#x27;s understanding of cats and their care

==Operations==

In 2017, the charity helped nearly 193,000 cats (rehoming around 43,000 of these and neutering 153,000). Its network had 36 centres, 250+ volunteer-run branches, 121 charity shops and approximately 10,200 volunteers and staff located throughout the UK. The charity&#x27;s income for 2017 was £62.9 million.

In 2011, the charity announced that it had helped more than one million cats over the previous five years, 80% of this figure being neutering and 20% being rehoming.

Alongside rehoming cats and kittens, the charity runs a neutering scheme for owners on a limited income, and a National Information Line. In addition, they monitor (and feed) feral colonies in the area including trapping, neutering and re-releasing (where possible) feral cats back to where they came from. They also work to educate adults and children about cat welfare, and run talks and educational resource programmes across the UK.

===Volunteer branches===
The charity operates in two ways: volunteer-run branches and centres. The main difference is that volunteer-run branches are people with a spare room or space in a garden for a pen (or two). Instead of visiting a dedicated centre, the person wishing to adopt a cat usually visits it in another person&#x27;s home.

===Adoption centres===

Dedicated centres are of varying size and have paid staff in addition to volunteers on their team. The vast majority of the public visit these places to adopt a cat or a kitten. Centres are funded centrally by the charity, though many also have &quot;Friends of...&quot; groups that raise funds locally. In addition, there is often the chance of cat sponsorship, where members of the public can sponsor a pen in return for a monthly or annual donation. Sponsors receive regular updates on the cats using their pens.

In 2002, Cats Protection acquired the Isle of Thorns estate from the University of Sussex. The estate is now the National Cat Centre.

In 2008, the charity was affected by the financial markets crisis emanating from Iceland, losing £11.2 million of its financial reserves. In 2012, having suffered continuing financial losses, the charity was forced to make over 80 staff redundant, the majority of these being staff working on the operational front line in adoption centres or supporting branches.

<text>Mariska Magdolna Hargitay (; born January 23, 1964) is an American actress, producer, and philanthropist. Hargitay has played Olivia Benson on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; since 1999, which is the longest-running character in the longest-running American primetime drama. Since 2013, she is among the highest-paid actresses on television. Her accolades include two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award, and in 2013, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She is also known for her philanthropic work and activism. 

Hargitay was born in Santa Monica, California, and is the daughter of bodybuilder and actor Mickey Hargitay and actress Jayne Mansfield. She attended Marymount High School in Los Angeles and enrolled in the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, leaving before completing her degree to pursue acting. Her early credits include the series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (both 1988), &quot;Tequila and Bonetti&quot; (1992), &quot;Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; (1995–1996), and &quot;ER&quot; (1997–1998), and the drama film &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; (1995). Aside from &quot;SVU&quot;, she co-produced the HBO documentary &quot;I Am Evidence&quot; (2017).

Hargitay founded the Joyful Heart Foundation, which provides support to people who have been sexually abused, and became a certified rape counselor. She has engaged in initiatives to support domestic violence shelters, raise awareness about untested rape kits, and contributed to other causes.

==Early life==

Hargitay was born at Providence Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, the daughter of actress and 1950s-era sex symbol Jayne Mansfield. Her father was the Hungarian-born former Mr. Universe, Mickey Hargitay. Her first and middle names are Hungarian and refer to Mary Magdalene (Mariska is a diminutive of Mary). She was raised Catholic and has two older brothers, Miklós and Zoltán, as well as three half-siblings, Jayne Marie Mansfield and Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; Cimber (from her mother&#x27;s first and third marriages, respectively) and Tina Hargitay (from her father&#x27;s first marriage). In 1962, troubles arose in Mansfield and Hargitay&#x27;s marriage after Mansfield had an affair with an Italian filmmaker. Hargitay&#x27;s parents divorced in May 1963, but a judge later found their Mexican divorce invalid. However, after Mansfield realized she was pregnant with Mariska, she and Hargitay reconciled a few months before their daughter&#x27;s birth in January 1964. However, they soon separated again. In August 1964, Hargitay&#x27;s mother successfully petitioned the court to rule the Mexican divorce legal. Even after the divorce, they remained good friends. A few weeks later, Mansfield married the director Matt Cimber, who had directed her in a 1964 production of the William Inge play &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. In July 1966, Mansfield filed for divorce from Cimber. However, the divorce was never finalized.

On June 29, 1967, Mansfield was in an automobile accident on a stretch of U.S. Route 90 between New Orleans and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The accident ripped off the top of the car, instantly killing Mansfield, her boyfriend Sam Brody, and the driver. Asleep in the back of the vehicle, Mariska, then three-and-a-half years old, was left with a zigzag scar on one side of her head. Her brothers, Miklós and Zoltán, escaped with minor injuries. After the death of their mother, the three siblings were raised by their father and his third wife, Ellen Siano. Hargitay dislikes comparisons with her famous mother and, at age 18, said, &quot;My dad was Mr. Universe, so it would be fun for me to be Miss Universe&quot;. Hargitay has said that the early loss of her mother left &quot;a hole in my life that won&#x27;t ever be filled. I will never get over it. I will always be a girl who lost her mom&quot;. Hargitay&#x27;s father died in September 2006 from multiple myeloma in Los Angeles, California, at age 80.

While a student at her Catholic secondary school, Marymount High School, Hargitay was active in cheerleading, student government, athletics, and the theater program. She enjoyed acting and enrolled at UCLA after graduation from high school in 1982. That same year, Hargitay was crowned Miss Beverly Hills USA. By the time she was a freshman in college, Hargitay had an agent and several small roles to her credit. She attended UCLA School of Theater Film and Television where she was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma. She left before completing her degree. Hargitay attended Groundlings Theatre and School in Los Angeles.

==Career==

=== Early years and roles ===
After Hargitay was crowned Miss Beverly Hills USA, she competed in the Miss California USA pageant the following year and placed fourth runner-up to Julie Hayek, who was later crowned Miss USA. In 1984, Hargitay appeared in Ronnie Milsap&#x27;s music video for &quot;She Loves My Car&quot;, the first country music video to appear on MTV. A year later she had a small role in the horror film &quot;Ghoulies&quot;. Hargitay has appeared on numerous other television programs, including: &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares – A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Series&quot;, &quot;Ellen&quot;, &quot;All-American Girl&quot;, &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Cracker&quot;, &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Fire&quot;, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, &quot;The Single Guy&quot;, &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, and &quot;thirtysomething&quot;. Her voice is featured on the 2005 video game &quot;True Crime: New York City&quot;. Hargitay also had a minor role in the 1995 film &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;. 

Hargitay briefly replaced Gabrielle Fitzpatrick as Dulcea in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;, although her scenes were cut from the film when Fitzpatrick recovered from her surgery and returned to the film. 

In 1988, she had a recurring role as Carly Fixx in the soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. She portrayed police officer Angela Garcia in the 1992 series &quot;Tequila and Bonetti&quot; and appeared in the two-part fourth season finale episode of &quot;Seinfeld,&quot; where they had her read for the role of Elaine Benes in &quot;The Pilot&quot;. She was considered for the character of Elaine Benes on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; itself before it began. Two years later, Hargitay portrayed Didi Edelstein, the sexy next-door neighbor, in the 1995 sitcom &quot;Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot;, which starred Nancy McKeon. In 1997, Hargitay played detective Nina Echeverria on the drama series &quot;Prince Street&quot;, and had a recurring role as inept desk clerk Cynthia Hooper during the fourth season of &quot;ER&quot;. 

Hargitay said in 1986 that she never thought about doing television until a role on the one-hour adventure drama series &quot;Downtown&quot; was offered. In fact, she experienced difficulties in her efforts to begin a career as a Hollywood actor. Hargitay endured frequent comparisons to her mother.

=== &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; ===
Casting for the lead characters of NBC police procedural television drama series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; occurred in the spring of 1999. Dick Wolf, along with officials from NBC and Studios USA, was at the final auditions for the two leads at Rockefeller Center. The last round had been narrowed down to six finalists. For the female lead – Detective Olivia Benson – Samantha Mathis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Hargitay were being considered. For the male lead – Detective Elliot Stabler – the finalists were Tim Matheson, John Slattery, and Christopher Meloni. Meloni and Hargitay had auditioned in the final round together, and after the actors left, there was a moment of dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, &quot;Oh well. There&#x27;s no doubt who we should choose – Hargitay and Meloni.&quot; The duo, who Wolf believed had the perfect chemistry from the first time he saw them together, were his first choice. Garth Ancier, then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled voiced their assent. 

Hargitay trained as a rape crisis advocate to prepare for the role of Benson. She has portrayed Benson since 1999. Hargitay won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for the role. She received UCLA&#x27;s TFT Distinguished Alumni Award in 2011 and was honored at the school&#x27;s June commencement ceremony. During the last months of her pregnancy in 2006, Hargitay took maternity leave from &quot;SVU&quot;, and was temporarily replaced by Connie Nielsen, who portrayed Stabler&#x27;s temporary partner Dani Beck.

In late December 2008, Hargitay suffered a partially collapsed lung after taking a fall during a stunt on the set of &quot;SVU&quot;. She underwent surgery in January and returned to work shortly afterward. On March 3, 2009, she was hospitalized after suffering from chest pains related to the injury. She missed one episode on &quot;SVU&quot; tenth season. In May 2009, after the show&#x27;s tenth season, Hargitay and Meloni&#x27;s contracts expired when they were reportedly making $375,000–$385,000 per episode. During negotiations in April for a new contract, the duo attempted to receive a percentage of the show&#x27;s profits as other high-profile &quot;Law and Order&quot; actors had done in the past. It was rumored that NBC threatened to replace Hargitay and Meloni if they persisted in their demands. However, two months later it was officially reported that both their contracts had been renewed for two more years. When the thirteenth season was about to air, initial reports indicated that Hargitay would appear in only the first 13 episodes. However, NBC chairman Bob Greenblatt later clarified that she would be in every episode of the season.

As of August 2012, Hargitay was earning approximately $400,000–$500,000 per episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. In 2013 and 2014, she was ranked by Forbes as the second highest-paid television actress, only after Sofia Vergara of &quot;Modern Family&quot;. Hargitay continues to be considered one of the highest-paid television actresses in the world, making well over $500,000 per episode. 

In 2013, Hargitay was awarded with the 2,511th star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Her star was placed next to the star of her mother, which is located at 6328 Hollywood Boulevard. In July 2021, Hargitay suffered a broken ankle after taking a fall in the rain while leaving the screening of &quot;Black Widow&quot;. Her injury caused minor script changes and was written into the season 23 premiere of &quot;SVU&quot;.

=== Other work ===
In January 2007, she and her older son appeared in a &quot;Got Milk?&quot; advertisement.

At the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, Hargitay won the &quot;Video of the Year&quot; Award, shared with Taylor Swift and all of the celebrities that appeared in the music video for Swift&#x27;s song &quot;Bad Blood&quot;. 

Hargitay produced a documentary, &quot;I Am Evidence&quot; released by HBO in 2018, following the thousands of untested rape kits; Hargitay called this lack of testing &quot;the clearest and most shocking demonstration of how we regard these crimes in our country.&quot; The film received Best Documentary at the 40th News and Documentary Emmy Awards, winning Hargitay her second Emmy and first as a producer.

Hargitay was a guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional December 19–20, 2022.

== Other activities ==

=== Joyful Heart Foundation ===
Hargitay is the founder and former president of the Joyful Heart Foundation, an organization established in 2004 to provide support to survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, child abuse, elder abuse and human trafficking. According to Hargitay, she was inspired by an encounter with a pod of dolphins that surrounded her while she was swimming off the coast of Hawaii at the age of 15. The encounter, which had ignited profound spiritual feelings within her, was one that Hargitay hoped to share with others. 

In November 2009, Hargitay and the Joyful Heart Foundation built healing and wellness kits for women who suffered domestic violence and were currently in the Los Angeles County&#x27;s domestic violence shelters. They created enough kits to give one to each of about 600 women. In California, the domestic violence services budget was in a major crisis, and shelters were forced to turn women away. Hargitay and her foundation donated money to the cause. Hargitay has worked with Michigan Police and Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy to raise awareness about the statistics of untested rape kits. Hargitay appeared in the 17th season of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The More You Know&quot; public service announcements in 2006, and again in the spring of 2009. She is an honorary board member director of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. 

As of November 2010, the Joyful Heart Foundation has sent over 5,000 women and children on therapeutic programs in New York, Los Angeles, and Hawaii, which combine yoga, meditation, massage, journaling, and swimming with dolphins.

According to Hargitay, the Foundation has raised $20 million and helped approximately 5,000 survivors as of April 2011. Reference to the Joyful Heart Foundation was worked into episodes of &quot;Special Victims Unit&quot;, via a necklace containing two pendants representing the Foundation that Hargitay&#x27;s character began wearing in the show&#x27;s 13th season. The Foundation works with several brands to create products supporting the cause, including Me&amp;Ro, Michael Stars, and AZIAM&#x27;s Wife Lover Tanks.

=== Continued activism and rape counseling ===
On September 27, 2011, Hargitay donated $100,000 to her alma mater, the UCLA School of Theater Film and Television for scholarship. In 2012, Hargitay campaigned for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).

Hargitay is a certified rape counselor. 

As a rape survivor, Hargitay has called for an end to the stigma surrounding sexual assault. In a 2024 essay, she wrote, &quot;Tell someone you’ve survived cancer, and you’re celebrated. I want the same response for sexual assault survivors. I want no shame with the victim.&quot;

==Personal life==
On August 28, 2004, in Santa Barbara, California, Hargitay married Peter Hermann, an actor whom she met on the set of &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot;, on which he plays the recurring role of defense attorney Trevor Langan. On June 28, 2006, Hargitay gave birth to their son, August, by an emergency caesarean section. In April 2011, she and her husband adopted a baby girl, Amaya, and attended her birth. In October 2011, she and her husband adopted a son, Andrew, who had been born in 2011.

Hargitay speaks five languages: English, French, Hungarian, Spanish, and Italian. She is the godmother to Sophia, one of co-star Christopher Meloni&#x27;s children. Actress Hilary Swank is her daughter&#x27;s godmother. 

In a 2010 interview with &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, Hargitay stated that she considers herself a Christian.

In a personal essay published by &quot;People&quot; in 2024, Hargitay revealed that she is a survivor of rape. She credited other survivors for giving her strength.

<text>Esher ( ) is a town in the borough of Elmbridge in Surrey, England, to the east of the River Mole.

Esher is an outlying suburb of London, close to the London–Surrey border; with Esher Commons at its southern end, the town marks one limit of the Greater London Built-Up Area. Elevations range from 10m to 47m above sea level. 

Esher has a linear commercial high street and is otherwise suburban in density, with varying elevations, few high rise buildings and very short sections of dual carriageway within the ward itself. Esher covers a large area, between 13 and 15.4 miles southwest of Charing Cross. In the south it is bounded by the A3 Portsmouth Road which is of urban motorway standard and buffered by the Esher Commons.

Esher is bisected by the A307, historically the Portsmouth Road, which for approximately forms its high street. Esher railway station (served by the South West Main Line) connects the town to London Waterloo. 

Sandown Park Racecourse is in the town near the station. In the south, Claremont Landscape Garden owned and managed by the National Trust, once belonged to Princess Charlotte and her husband Leopold I of Belgium. Accordingly, the town was selected to have a fountain by Queen Victoria and has an adjacent Diamond Jubilee column embossed with a relief of the monarch and topped by a statue of Britannia. Unite, the union, trains representatives at its Esher Place centre, and the town has the offices of Elmbridge Borough Council in its high street.

==History==

Esher lay within the Saxon feudal division of Elmbridge hundred.

Esher appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Aissela&quot; and &quot;Aissele&quot;, where it is held partly by the Abbey of the Cross in Normandy; partly by William de Waterville; partly by Reginald; partly by Hugh do Port; and partly by Odard Balistarius (probably a crossbowman). Its domesday assets were: 14 hides, 6 ploughs and of meadow. It rendered £6 2s 0d per year to its feudal overlords.

In the 16th century King Henry VIII annexed several of the manors to the Honour of Hampton Court, including Esher, to form a royal hunting ground. The town slowly grew as a stagecoach stop on the London–Portsmouth road that was later numbered the A3, although it was bypassed in the mid-1970s when it became the A307. Clive of India built the Claremont mansion and this later became a royal residence used by Queen Victoria. In 1841 Esher had 1261 inhabitants across . Queen Victoria lent Claremont to the exiled French King Louis-Philippe and his consort Queen Marie-Amelie after the revolution of 1848. Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg lived there until he became King of the Belgians.

By 1908, Esher contained the fashionable residences of several important figures including Lady Emma Talbot; Sir Robert Hawthorn Collins, the Duchess of Albany and Sir Edgar Vincent, K.C.M.G. who was later created 1st Viscount D&#x27;Abernon.

George Harrison of The Beatles owned a house (named Kinfauns) in Esher, during the 1960s. The other Beatles were regular visitors to the house, and Harrison&#x27;s primitive home recording studio.

Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees owned a home called The Firs in Esher, during 1970s–2004 and sold after his death. This is where the hit single &quot;Juliet&quot; was written and recorded by Maurice and Robin Gibb in the Studio at The Firs for brother Robin&#x27;s solo album project in the 1980s.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle placed the murder of fictional character, Mr. Garcia, in and around Esher in his Sherlock Holmes mystery, &quot;The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge&quot;. In the mystery, Dr. Watson described his and Sherlock Holmes&#x27; arrival in Esher by stating, &quot;It was nearly six c&#x27;clock before we found ourselves in the pretty Surrey village of Esher, with Inspector Baynes as our companion.&quot;

== Government ==
Esher is within the Esher and Walton parliamentary constituency which is represented by Monica Harding, a member of the Liberal Democratic party, since July 2024. The predecessor Esher parliamentary constituency was replaced on boundary changes before the 1997 general election.

Esher is part of the &quot;East Molesey and Esher&quot; ward of Surrey County Council. The ward is represented by a Residents&#x27; association councillor.

The town is covered by the Esher ward of Elmbridge Borough Council, which has elections in three years out of four (is elected in thirds). Esher Town Hall has reverted to its original name of Sandown House and has been converted into apartments.

==Education==
Esher has a mix of state and private schools. There are four state primary schools across the area of Esher, Esher Church School, Cranmere, Hinchley Wood and Claygate. Esher Church of England High School is the state secondary school in the town of Esher. Hinchley Wood School in Hinchley Wood has been an Academy since February 2012. Hinchley Wood is also one of the Further education establishments in the area. Esher College is in nearby Thames Ditton.
Esher is also home to the West End Playgroup &amp; Forest School, a pre-school for 2-5 year olds.

==Culture, community and sport==
===Cinema===
The Everyman (formerly Odeon) cinema is a central feature of Esher&#x27;s High Street with four screens.

===Sport===
Esher Cricket Club was established in 1863. They play matches in the Esher Park private estate, in New Road and have a youth cricket training and playing squad. The members of the cricket club also wanted to play tennis and established the Esher Lawn Tennis Club in 1889. A second cricket club arrived in 1875 as West End (Esher) Cricket Club.

Esher has a history with horse racing since the purpose-built Sandown Park race course opened in 1875.

In 1881 Esher Leopold football club was established which was formed out of the ashes of the dissolved Weybridge Swallows club. The club played at Sandown Park, close to the racecourse. The club&#x27;s sole contribution to the national game was its one appearance in the FA Cup, a 5–0 home defeat to the holders, Old Carthusians, in 1881–82, although the club did reach the semi-finals of the Surrey Senior Cup, losing to Reigate Priory. The club continued into the 1883–84 season.

Esher Rugby Club was established in 1923 and play on the Hersham borders at the Molesey Road stadium, where they have several training grounds there.

A smaller football club AFC Westend was established in 2003.

===Amenities, local events and media===

Esher Theatre is a 300 seat performing arts venue on Esher High Street, which opened on 4 September 2021.

Esher West End hosts an annual flower show and the Hampton Court Flower Show is nearby. Similarly, Surrey Wildlife Trust manage Wisley and Ockham Commons, partly within the borough of Elmbridge and Esher is approximately midway between the two leading Surrey and International Gardens, the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew and RHS Garden, Wisley.

A weekly newspaper, &quot;Esher News and Mail&quot;, closed down in 2009. Current newspapers include the &quot;Surrey Herald: Cobham, Esher and Claygate edition&quot; and &quot;Living Within&quot; monthly magazine/newspaper.

Vantage points include various outcrops of Esher Commons close to Hersham, Cobham and Oxshott for free public use; Esher Place (national training centre of Unite, the union) where a grass garden amphitheatre was built by Lutyens for what was the manor house; the facilities at Sandown Park racecourse and Claremont Landscape Garden.

==Housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the settlement who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

<text>Ratification is a principal&#x27;s of an act of its agent. In international law, ratification is the process by which a state declares its consent to be bound to a treaty. In the case of bilateral treaties, ratification is usually accomplished by exchanging the requisite instruments, and in the case of multilateral treaties, the usual procedure is for the depositary to collect the ratifications of all states, keeping all parties informed of the situation.

The institution of ratification grants states the necessary time-frame to seek the required approval for the treaty on the domestic level and to enact the necessary legislation to give domestic effect to that treaty. The term applies to private contract law, international treaties, and constitutions in federal states such as the United States and Canada. The term is also used in parliamentary procedure in deliberative assemblies.

== Contract law ==
In contract law, the need for ratification often arises in two ways: if the agent attempts to bind the principal despite lacking the authority to do so; and if the principal authorizes the agent to make an agreement, but reserves the right to approve it. An example of the former situation is an employee not normally responsible for procuring supplies contracting to do so on the employer&#x27;s behalf. The employer&#x27;s choice on discovering the contract is to ratify it or to repudiate it.

The latter situation is common in trade union collective bargaining agreements. The union authorizes one or more people to negotiate and sign an agreement with management. A collective bargaining agreement can not become legally binding until the union members ratify the agreement. If the union members do not approve it, the agreement is void, and negotiations resume.

== Parliamentary procedure ==
A deliberative assembly, using parliamentary procedure, could ratify action that otherwise was not validly taken. For example, action taken where there was no quorum at the meeting is not valid until it is later ratified at a meeting where a quorum is present. 

== Ratification of an international treaty ==

The ratification of international treaties is always accomplished by filing instruments of ratification as provided for in the treaty. In many democracies, the legislature authorizes the government to ratify treaties through standard legislative procedures by passing a bill.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, power to enter into treaties is an executive power within Section 61 of the Australian Constitution so the Australian Government may enter into a binding treaty without seeking parliamentary approval. Nevertheless, most treaties are tabled in parliament for between 15 and 20 joint sitting days for scrutiny by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, and if implementation of treaties requires legislation by the Australian parliament, this must be passed by both houses prior to ratification.

=== India ===
The President makes a treaty in exercise of his executive power, on the aid and the advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister, and no court of law in India may question its validity. However, no agreement or treaty entered into by the president is enforceable by the courts which is incompatible with Indian constitution/ national law, as India follows dualist theory for the implementation of international laws.

If the Parliament wishes to codify the agreement entered into by the executive thereby making it enforceable by the courts of India, it may do so under of the constitution.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, in principle both houses of the parliament (the National Diet) must approve the treaty for ratification. If the House of Councilors rejects a treaty approved by the House of Representatives, and a joint committee of both houses cannot come to agreement on amendments to the original text of the treaty, or the House of Councilors fails to decide on a treaty for more than thirty days, the House of Representatives the will be regarded as the vote of the National Diet approving the ratification. The approved treaty will then be promulgated into law by the act of the Emperor.

=== United Kingdom ===
Treaty ratification is a royal prerogative, exercised by the monarch on the advice of the government. By a convention called the Ponsonby Rule, treaties were usually placed before Parliament for 21 days before ratification, but Parliament has no power to veto or to ratify. The Ponsonby Rule was put on a statutory footing by Part 2 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010.

=== United States ===
Treaty power is a coordinated effort between the Executive branch and the Senate. The President may form and negotiate, but the treaty must be advised and consented to by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. Only after the Senate approves the treaty can the President ratify it. Once it is ratified, it becomes binding on all the states under the Supremacy Clause. While the House of Representatives does not vote on it at all, the supermajority requirement for the Senate&#x27;s advice and consent to ratification makes it considerably more difficult to rally enough political support for international treaties. Also, if implementation of the treaty requires the expenditure of funds, the House of Representatives may be able to block or at least impede such implementation by refusing to vote for the appropriation of the necessary funds.

The President usually submits a treaty to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) along with an accompanying resolution of ratification or accession. If the treaty and resolution receive favorable committee consideration (a committee vote in favor of ratification or accession), the treaty is then forwarded to the floor of the full Senate for such a vote. The treaty or legislation does not apply until it has been ratified. A multilateral agreement may provide that it will take effect upon its ratification by less than all of the signatories. Even though such a treaty takes effect, it does not apply to signatories that have not ratified it. Accession has the same legal effect as ratification, for treaties already negotiated and signed by other states. An example of a treaty to which the Senate did not advise and consent to ratification is the Treaty of Versailles, which failed to garner support because of the Covenant of the League of Nations.

The US can also enter into international agreements by way of executive agreements. They are not made under the Treaty Clause and do not require approval by two-thirds of the Senate. Congressional-executive agreements are passed by a majority of both houses of Congress as a regular law. If the agreement is completely within the President&#x27;s constitutional powers, it can be made by the President alone without Congressional approval, but it will have the force of an executive order and can be unilaterally revoked by a future President. All types of agreements are treated internationally as &quot;treaties&quot;. See Foreign policy of the United States#Law.

== Ratification of a constitution ==
Federations usually require the support of both the federal government and some given percentage of the constituent governments for amendments to the federal constitution to take effect.

=== Ratification in the Constitution of India ===

Not all constitutional amendments in India require ratification by the states. Only constitutional amendments that seek to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to of the Constitution of India, must be ratified by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. These provisions relate to certain matters concerning the federal structure or of common interest to both the Union and the States viz., the election of the President (articles 54 and 55); the extent of the executive power of the Union and the States (Articles 73 and 162); the High Courts for Union territories (Article 241); The Union Judiciary and the High Courts in the States (Chapter IV of Part V and Chapter V of Part VI); the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States (Chapter I of Part XI and Seventh Schedule); the representation of States in Parliament; and the provision for amendment of the Constitution laid down in Article 368. Ratification is done by a resolution passed by the State Legislatures. There is no specific time limit for the ratification of an amending Bill by the State Legislatures. However, the resolutions ratifying the proposed amendment must be passed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent.

However, when the treaty terms are interfering with the powers exclusively applicable to states (State List), prior ratification of all applicable states are to be obtained per of the Indian constitution before the ratification by the Parliament.

=== Ratification in the United States Constitution ===

Article VII of the Constitution of the United States describes the process by which the entire document was to become effective. It required that conventions of nine of the thirteen original States ratify the Constitution. If fewer than thirteen states ratified the document, it would become effective only among the states ratifying it. New Hampshire was the ninth state to ratify, doing so on June 21, 1788, but, as a practical matter, it was decided to delay implementation of the new government until New York and Virginia could be persuaded to ratify. Congress intended that New York City should be the first capital, and that George Washington, of Mount Vernon, Virginia, should be the first President, and both of those things would have been somewhat awkward if either New York or Virginia were not part of the new government. Ratification by those states was secured—Virginia on June 25 and New York on July 26—and the government under the Constitution began on March 4, 1789.

For subsequent amendments, Article V describes the process of a potential amendment&#x27;s adoption. Proposals to adopt an amendment may be called either by a two-thirds vote by both houses of Congress or by a national convention as a result of resolutions adopted by two-thirds (presently at least 34 out of 50) of the states&#x27; legislatures. For a proposed amendment to be adopted, three-quarters of the states (presently at least 38 out of 50) must then ratify the amendment either by a vote of approval in each state&#x27;s legislature or by state ratifying conventions. Congress may specify which method must be used to ratify the amendment. Congress may also set a deadline by which the threshold for adoption must be met.

<doc id="429657" wikidata="Q158952" url="?curid=429657" title="Catwoman">
<text>Catwoman is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, she debuted as &quot;the Cat&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #1 (spring 1940). She has become one of the superhero Batman&#x27;s most prominent enemies, belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery, as well as Batman&#x27;s best known and most enduring love interest, with many stories depicting their complex love–hate relationship. Since 1993, Catwoman has had her own ongoing series, &quot;Catwoman&quot;.

Catwoman is the alter ego of Selina Kyle, a burglar in Gotham City who usually wears a skintight bodysuit and uses a bullwhip for a weapon. She was originally characterized as a supervillain and adversary of Batman, but has been featured in an eponymous series since the 1990s that portrays her as an antiheroine, often with a utilitarian moral philosophy. The character thrived in her earliest appearances, but she took an extended hiatus from September 1954 to November 1966 due to the developing Comics Code Authority in 1954. These issues involved the rules regarding the development and portrayal of female characters that were in violation of the Comics Code, a code which is no longer in use. In the comics, Holly Robinson and Eiko Hasigawa have both adopted the Catwoman identity, apart from Selina Kyle.

Catwoman has been adapted in various media incarnations, having been portrayed in film by Lee Meriwether in &quot;Batman&quot; (1966), Michelle Pfeiffer in &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), Halle Berry in &quot;Catwoman&quot; (2004), Anne Hathaway in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), and Zoë Kravitz in &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022). On television, she has been played by Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt in &quot;Batman&quot;, where the name Selina Kyle was never used; and Camren Bicondova and Lili Simmons in &quot;Gotham&quot;.

Catwoman was ranked 11th on IGN&#x27;s list of the &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time&quot;, and 51st on &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Villains of All Time&quot; list. Conversely, she was ranked 20th on IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time&quot; list.

==Development==
===Creation===
Batman co-creator Bob Kane was a great movie fan and his love for film provided the impetus for several Batman characters, among them, Catwoman. Kane&#x27;s inspiration for Catwoman was drawn from multiple sources to include actresses Jean Harlow, Hedy Lamarr, and his cousin, Ruth Steele. Kane and Finger wanted to give their comic book sex appeal, as well as a character who could appeal to female readers; they thus created a &quot;friendly foe who committed crimes but was also a romantic interest in Batman&#x27;s rather sterile life.&quot; Catwoman was meant to be a love interest and to engage Batman in a chess game, with him trying to reform her. At the same time, this character was meant to be different from other Batman villains like the Joker in that she was never a killer or evil.

As for using cat imagery with the character, Kane stated that he and Finger saw cats as &quot;kind of the antithesis of bats&quot;.
==Fictional character biography==
===Golden Age===
Catwoman, then called &quot;the Cat&quot;, first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #1 (spring 1940) as a mysterious burglar and jewel thief, revealed at the end of the story to be a young, attractive (unnamed) woman, having disguised herself as an old woman during the story and been hired to commit a burglary. Although she does not wear her iconic cat-suit, the story establishes her core personality as a femme fatale who both antagonizes and attracts Batman. It is implied Batman may have deliberately let her get away by blocking Robin as he tried to leap after her. She next appears in &quot;Batman&quot; #2 in a story also involving the Joker but escapes Batman in the end. In &quot;Batman&quot; #3 she wears a fur mask and again succeeds in escaping Batman.

&quot;Batman&quot; #62 (December 1950) reveals that Catwoman was an amnesiac flight attendant who turned to crime after suffering a prior blow to the head during a plane crash she survived. She reveals this in the Batcave after being hit on the head by a piece of rubble while saving Batman while he was chasing her. However, in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #197 (April 1983), she later admits that she made up the amnesia story because she wanted a way out of her past life of crime. She reforms for several years, helping out Batman in &quot;Batman&quot; #65 (June 1951) and 69 (February 1952), until she decides to return to a life of crime in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #203 (January 1954), after a newspaper publishes stories of Batman&#x27;s past adventures and some crooks mock her about it. However, Catwoman prevents her thugs from murdering Batman once he is later found knocked out, but quickly claims she wants him as a hostage. Catwoman appears again as a criminal in &quot;Batman&quot; #84 (June 1954) and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #211 (September 1954), which were her two final appearances until 1966. This was mostly due to her possible violation of the developing Comics Code Authority&#x27;s rules for portrayal of female characters that started in 1954.

===Silver Age===
Catwoman made her first Silver Age appearance in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; #70-71 (November–December 1966); afterward, she continued to make appearances across the various &quot;Batman&quot; comics.

Several stories in the 1970s featured Catwoman committing murder, something that neither the Earth-One nor Earth-Two versions of her would ever do. This version of Catwoman was later assigned to the alternate world of Earth-B, an alternate Earth that included stories that could not be considered canonical on Earth-One or Earth-Two.

===Modern Age===
====Tangled origins====
Catwoman&#x27;s origin—and, to an extent, her character—was revised in 1987 when writer Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli published &quot;&quot;, a revision of Batman&#x27;s origin. She worked as a dominatrix for the pimp Stan to survive and also sheltered a child prostitute named Holly Robinson working for him. Selina got into a fight with a disguised Bruce after he grabbed Holly, who had stabbed him during a fight with Stan, but was knocked out.

As the story progresses, Selina decides to leave prostitution and takes Holly with her. She gets into burglary to make money and starts robbing the rich and powerful men of Gotham, donning a catsuit costume while committing her heists. While trying to rob Carmine Falcone, she gets rescued by Batman but is irked of being thought of as his sidekick by the media.

The 1989 &quot;Catwoman&quot; limited series, written by Mindy Newell and with art by J.J. Birch, expanded upon Miller&#x27;s &quot;Year One&quot; origin. This storyline, known as &quot;Her Sister&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, explores Selina&#x27;s early life as a dominatrix and the start of her career as Catwoman. The story culminates with Selina&#x27;s former pimp, Stan, abducting and beating her sister Maggie, who, in contrast to Selina, is a nun. Selina kills Stan to save her sister, and gets away with it. Most of this is revealed in the former series, but is expanded upon in &quot;Her Sister&#x27;s Keeper&quot;.

&quot;Catwoman&quot; (vol. 2) #69 provides details about Selina&#x27;s childhood and neglects Maggie&#x27;s existence. Maria Kyle is a distant parent who preferred to spend her time with cats, and commits suicide when Selina is very young. Her alcoholic father, Brian, is cold to Selina for resembling her mother, whom he resents for dying, and eventually drinks himself to death. To survive, Selina takes to the streets for a time before getting caught and sent first to an orphanage, then juvenile detention center, &quot;where Selina began to see how hard the world could really be&quot;. Maggie&#x27;s fate at this point in the timeline is not alluded to. However, when Ed Brubaker reintroduces her into the comic, he implies that Maggie may have directly entered an orphanage and promptly been adopted.

When she is 13 years old, Selina discovers that the detention center&#x27;s administrator has been embezzling funds, and she confronts her. In an attempt to cover up her crime, the administrator puts Selina in a bag and drops her in a river to drown (like a cat). She escapes and returns to the orphanage, where she steals documents exposing the administrator&#x27;s corruption. She uses these to blackmail the administrator into erasing &quot;Selina Kyle&quot; from the city&#x27;s records, then steals the administrator&#x27;s diamond necklace and escapes from the orphanage. Selina eventually finds herself in &quot;Alleytown – a network of cobblestone streets that form a small borough between the East End and Old Gotham.&quot; Selina is taken in by Mama Fortuna, the elderly leader of a gang of young thieves, and is taught how to steal. Fortuna treats her students like slaves, keeping their earnings for herself. Selina eventually runs away, accompanied by her friend Sylvia. However, the two have difficulty surviving on their own, and in desperation try to support themselves by working as prostitutes. The two drift apart afterward, with Sylvia coming to resent Selina for not inquiring about what had happened to her at the hands of her abusive first client.

In the &quot;Catwoman: Year One&quot; story, Selina, who is now an adult, achieves some success as a thief. Following a disastrous burglary, however, she accepts an offer to &quot;lie low&quot; as a dominatrix employed by a pimp named Stan. They plan to trick men into divulging information that might be used in future crimes. According to this storyline, Selina trains under the Armless Master of Gotham City, receiving education in martial arts and culture. During this time, a client gives her a cat o&#x27; nine tails, which Selina keeps as a trophy.

&quot;&quot;, the sequel to &quot;&quot;, implies that Catwoman suspects she is the illegitimate daughter of Mafia boss Carmine Falcone, although she finds no definitive proof. Selina&#x27;s connection to the Falcone crime family is further explored in the miniseries &quot;&quot;. Though the story adds more circumstantial evidence to the theory of Selina&#x27;s Falcone heritage, establishing that the Falcones&#x27; second-born daughter was put up for adoption in America, it also supplies no definitive proof. During &quot;Batman: The Long Halloween&quot;, Selina (out of costume) develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne, even leading her to save Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, this relationship appears to end on the Fourth of July when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. She leaves him for good and also leaves Gotham for a while in &quot;&quot;, after he stands her up on two holidays. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of &quot;&quot;, Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina.

Catwoman also appears in the &quot;&quot; saga, where she is approached by Bane&#x27;s henchmen while robbing a house. Bane asks her to work for him, but she refuses, as she is repulsed by the criminal who &quot;broke&quot; Batman. Later in the story, she boards a plane with Bruce Wayne to fly to Santa Prisca. She next appears in the &quot;&quot; saga, where Azrael is masquerading as Batman. She is one of the few to recognize that this Batman is an impostor, later being present when the true Batman returns to the fold as he struggles against his successor, his willingness to save even criminals confirming his true identity for Selina.

====&quot;Catwoman&quot; solo series====
In 1993, Catwoman was given her first ongoing comic book series. This series, written by an assortment of writers, but primarily penciled by Jim Balent, generally depicted the character as an international thief (and occasional bounty hunter) with an ambiguous moral code.

Story-lines include her adoption of teenage runaway and former sidekick, Arizona; aiding Bane, whom she later betrays to Azrael; and a stint as a reluctant government operative. The series also delves into her origin, revealing her beginnings as a young thief, her difficult period in juvenile incarceration, and her training with Ted &quot;Wildcat&quot; Grant.

Moving to New York City, Selina becomes corporate vice president of Randolf Industries, a Mafia-influenced company and then becomes its CEO through blackmail. She plans to use this position to run for Mayor of New York City, but her hopes are dashed when the Trickster inadvertently connects her to her criminal alter ego.

After her time in New York City, Selina returns to Gotham City, which at this time is in the midst of the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline. As Catwoman, she assists Batman against Lex Luthor in the reconstruction of the city. After being arrested by Commissioner Gordon, she escapes from prison. Later that year, during the &quot;Officer Down&quot; storyline in the &quot;Batman&quot; titles, Catwoman is initially the chief suspect. Although later cleared, she displays increasingly erratic behavior throughout the story, with her series later revealing that she has developed a form of personality disorder after exposure to the Scarecrow&#x27;s fear gas, causing her to act as herself and an identity that appears to be her sister Maggie pretending to be her. Soon afterward, she disappears and is believed to have been killed by the assassin Deathstroke the Terminator, ending her series at issue #94.

Catwoman then appears in a series of back-up stories in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #759–762 (August–November 2001). In the back-up storyline &quot;Trail of the Catwoman&quot;, by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Darwyn Cooke, private detective Slam Bradley attempts to find out what really happened to Selina Kyle. This storyline leads into the newest &quot;Catwoman&quot; series in late 2001 (written by Brubaker initially with Cooke, later joined by artist Cameron Stewart). In this series, Selina Kyle, joined by new supporting cast members Holly and Slam Bradley (a character from the early Golden Age DC Comics), becomes protector of the residents of Gotham&#x27;s East End, while still carrying out an ambitious career as a cat burglar.

During the &quot;Batman: Hush&quot; storyline, Batman and Catwoman briefly work together and have a romantic relationship, during which he reveals his true identity to her. At the end, he breaks off their relationship when he suspects it has been manipulated by the Riddler and Hush. This is the second story to establish that she knows Batman&#x27;s true identity. In an early 1980s storyline, Selina and Bruce develop a relationship. The concluding story features a closing panel in which she refers to Batman as &quot;Bruce&quot;. A change in the editorial team at that point, however, brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc.

In the &quot;Justice League&quot; story arc &quot;Crisis of Conscience&quot;, Catwoman fights alongside Batman and the Justice League against the old Secret Society of Super Villains, of which she had once briefly been a member.

====Mindwiping revelations====
Catwoman appears to be completely reformed, and her love for Batman is true (although brash and unpredictable). However, she has learned her reformation was the result of a mindwipe by Zatanna, a procedure known to deeply affect and, in at least one case, physically incapacitate its victims. Zatanna gives no reason for her actions, but in a flashback, it is shown that she had acted with the consent and aid of five of the seven JLA members who had helped her mindwipe Dr. Light and Batman. Catwoman&#x27;s response to this revelation is unequivocal: she gags Zatanna with duct tape, rendering her powerless, and pushes her out a window. Afterward, she is seen covering her bed with past versions of her Catwoman costume.

Still unbalanced and uncertain of herself in issue #52, Selina is forced to decide whether to kill a supervillain. Black Mask, in an attempt to &quot;improve himself&quot;, threatens the most important people in Selina&#x27;s life, from Slam Bradley to Holly. The villain had also previously tortured Selina&#x27;s sister Maggie by drilling out her husband&#x27;s eyeballs and feeding them to Maggie, which drove her insane. Black Mask learns Selina&#x27;s identity through his earlier alliance with Selina&#x27;s childhood friend Sylvia, who still harbors a grudge against Selina. Still thinking that Selina adheres to a strict no-kill rule, Black Mask is caught by surprise when Selina shoots him in the head. This action continues to haunt her throughout the &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline, and it is suggested that this might have been the first time she had ever directly taken a life.

====As a mother====
Following the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the DC Universe jumps forward in time. After &quot;One Year later&quot;, Selina Kyle is no longer Catwoman, she has left the East End, and has given birth to a daughter named Helena. The father of her new daughter is initially unrevealed; however, Batman demonstrates great concern for the child and at one point asks to have Helena stay at his mansion. Selina attempts to live a safe and somewhat normal life, and gives up her more dangerous ways of living as Catwoman. Holly Robinson takes over as the new Catwoman while Selina, living under the alias Irena Dubrovna, turns her attention to caring for her daughter (Selina&#x27;s alias was inspired by the name of the main character in the 1942 film &quot;Cat People&quot;).

Though she takes her role as a new mother quite seriously, Selina dons the costume for a run through the East End some days after Helena&#x27;s birth. Having gained a few pounds, Selina finds that her costume is now tighter. In addition, she is easily distracted by a common criminal. Although the situation is defused through Holly&#x27;s opportune arrival, the sight of two Catwomen active simultaneously in the city is caught on video. Selina returns home from her adventure to find that the mysterious movie aficionado the Film Freak has deduced her alias, teamed up with the Angle Man, and grabbed Helena. After rescuing her daughter, Selina convinces Zatanna to mindwipe the Film Freak and the Angle Man in order to preserve her secret identity. Following the procedure, the Angle Man turns himself in to the authorities; the Film Freak, however, embarks upon a murderous rampage.

A twist occurs when Wildcat informs Selina that Holly has been arrested for the murder of Black Mask. Selina infiltrates the police station and frees Holly. Finally defeating the Film Freak, Selina returns home to find that Bradley has deduced that Helena is the daughter of his son Sam Bradley, Jr., and therefore his granddaughter (although it is still strongly hinted that Bruce Wayne may be the father).

Batman asks Catwoman to infiltrate the violent tribe of the Bana Amazons during the &quot;Amazons Attack!&quot; crossover. Posing as a criminal, Selina gains the Bana&#x27;s trust and thwarts a terror attack aimed at causing mass casualties in Gotham City.

Selina questions whether she should be raising a daughter when her life as Catwoman has already proven to be such a danger to the child. After enlisting Batman&#x27;s help in faking the death of both herself and her daughter, Selina puts Helena up for adoption. A month after Helena is placed with a new family, Catwoman asks Zatanna to erase her memories of Helena and change her mind back to a criminal mentality. Zatanna refuses, judging that such an act would be cruel to both mother and daughter. She tells Selina that she could never reverse Selina&#x27;s mindset, since she was on the path to becoming a hero on her own. Believing she can no longer function as a criminal, Selina decided to become one of Batman&#x27;s Outsiders. She quickly quits, however, and is replaced by Batgirl.
====&quot;Salvation Run&quot;====
In &quot;Salvation Run&quot; #2, Catwoman is sent to the Prison Planet. She allies herself with Lex Luthor in an attempt to return to Earth, and mistakenly ends up on an alternate universe-Earth where Catwoman is a notorious villain. It is later revealed that this Earth is a creation of her own mind, and she has not left the Prison Planet. When accused of being a traitor by Luthor, she reveals the Martian Manhunter is posing as the Blockbuster, which would soon lead to the hero&#x27;s death.

Using the trust she regained in Luthor&#x27;s eyes, she earns a passage to the &#x27;real&#x27; Earth, in a jerry-rigged teleport machine built by Luthor for letting the villains escape. On Earth, she resumes being a hero, with occasional lapses into thievery by commission, simply for the thrill of it.

====&quot;Heart of Hush&quot;====

Later, in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, Selina is quite uncertain about pursuing a romantic relationship with Batman. She talks with Bruce about Jezebel Jet, his current girlfriend, and then has a quick pep talk with Zatanna, whom she believes is also courting Bruce. Zatanna confirms and admits her feelings, adding that she has since chosen to forget them, but extremely encourages Selina to open her heart to Bruce Wayne before Jet is able to &quot;seal the deal&quot;. Hush eavesdrops on the conversation, targeting both women as a way to hurt his enemy, Bruce Wayne.

In &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #848 (November 2008), Hush attacks Selina as she is in her apartment, kidnapping her and surgically removing her heart. She is delivered anonymously to a Gotham hospital. Batman receives word of her situation, and while he goes in search of Hush, he leaves Selina in the care of Doctor Mid-Nite, who is considered the superhero community&#x27;s chief doctor.

Batman recovers her heart, and Dr. Mid-Nite restores it to her body; however, the doctor also makes a prognosis on whether she can still return to her former life swinging through rooftops. While Selina is still in a coma, she encounters Zatanna, who apologizes for not warning her about Hush. She tells Selina that she was so happy about her relationship with Bruce that she ignored the other warnings in the cards. Zatanna gives her a little bottle supposedly containing aloe vera for her post-op scars. It is hinted that there is a little magic in there to help Selina with her recovery. Selina is sad that she might end up alone again. In the meantime, Bruce enters the recovery room and, believing her unconscious, launches into a soliloquy. He ends by telling Selina that he will always love her, when she opens her eyes and reveals to him that she was awake all the time and heard his confession.

====&quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot;====
During the events of &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot;, Selina and Bruce&#x27;s romance lasts only for a night because Bruce must continue to pose as Jezebel&#x27;s lover to bring down the Black Glove. While still recuperating, she pulls off one more heist and exacts her revenge on Hush. With the help of a few allies on both sides; the Oracle, Holly Robinson, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, and Slam Bradley, Selina taps into Hush&#x27;s assets, leaving him penniless and suffering from wounds inflicted by Batman.

====&quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot;====
In &quot;&quot;, Selina is seen as one of the members of Nightwing and Robin&#x27;s contingency team known as &quot;the Network&quot;, where she is seen taking down a gang of thugs before seeing Tim Drake dressed in a Batman uniform and is initially taken by surprise.

====&quot;Batman: Reborn&quot; and &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot;====
In the first issue of &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot;, Selina runs into the Bonebuster, a new villain trying to make a name for himself, and is saved by Poison Ivy. Selina, fearing the many dangers of a post-Batman Gotham, proposes that she, Ivy, and Harley Quinn team up, living together at a single base in an abandoned animal shelter. Ivy agrees under one condition: using home-grown drugs to weaken Selina&#x27;s resistance, Ivy demands the identity of the true Batman. Selina flashes back three years to when Talia al Ghul requested her presence in Tibet. There, Talia made it so that Selina would not relinquish the true identity of Batman under any circumstances. After the interrogation is over, Selina sees Harley with Bruce Wayne on TV. Selina tells Ivy that she knows it is Hush in disguise.

====&quot;Blackest Night&quot;====
During the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Selina is attacked by Black Mask after he has been reborn as a member of the Black Lantern Corps. After he tells her that he plans on getting an emotional response before killing her, Selina steals a car and heads to the mental institution where Maggie is held, believing Black Mask is coming for her. Black Mask attacks the institution, and somehow awakens Maggie from her coma. Selina arrives in time to help her sister flee into the sewers. While on the run, Maggie angrily tells Selina that she ruined both of their lives the day she decided to become Catwoman. Devastated by her sister&#x27;s statement, Selina fails to realize they have both been heading into a trap. Just as Black Mask is about to gouge Maggie&#x27;s eyes out and shove them down Selina&#x27;s throat, Harley and Ivy arrive and defeat the Black Lantern by trapping him in the stomach of a man-eating plant. Selina is helped to her feet by her friends, who tell her that Maggie has fled the scene. The next day, the staff members of the mental institution are shown discussing Maggie&#x27;s escape, also mentioning that a nun that works at the hospital had been found beaten and stripped of her uniform. Maggie is then shown in the depths of the Gotham City sewers clad in the bloodied nun robes, muttering about her plan to kill Catwoman in order to free Selina&#x27;s soul. Now calling herself Sister Zero, Maggie attempts to kill Selina, but ultimately flees after being defeated by the Sirens. She is last seen going over her options, now realizing that she cannot murder her own sister, and therefore must personally exorcise the &quot;cat demon&quot; from within Selina&#x27;s body.

====&quot;The Return of Bruce Wayne&quot;====
In the build-up to &quot;&quot;, the Sirens help Zatanna put out a massive fire at a local park near their home, only for them to be ambushed by a creature made of mud. After being dragged underneath the soil by the creature, Catwoman awakens bound and gagged on the floor of a dark room, and is quickly forced into an illusion by her unseen captors. Back in reality, Talia reveals to the Sirens that just a few hours prior, an unknown benefactor had offered up a massive reward to whoever could kidnap and deliver Catwoman to him, with the hopes that he could penetrate her mind and learn Batman&#x27;s secret identity. Before the knowledge can be ripped from her mind, Selina&#x27;s captors (revealed to be the Shrike and a new villain named the Sempai), are eventually defeated by the other Sirens.
Once Selina is freed, Talia orders Zatanna to wipe Bruce&#x27;s identity from her memory, reasoning that her kidnapping has proved that the knowledge is too dangerous for her to handle. The two women initially restrain Selina and attempt to remove the knowledge from her, but Zatanna refuses at the last moment and ends up fighting Talia in order to protect Selina. Talia tries to kill Selina before vanishing, but she survives and ultimately reunites with Bruce, who had recently returned to the present.

After stealing the contents of a safe belonging to the Falcone crime family, Selina returns home to find Kitrina, a teenaged escape artist and Carmine Falcone&#x27;s long-lost daughter, breaking into her room. She attacks and subdues Kitrina, who tells Selina that she had unknowingly stolen a map that details the location of the new Black Mask&#x27;s underground bunker. Realizing that she could use the map to capture Black Mask and claim the 50 million dollar bounty on his head, Selina leaves Kitrina bound in a locked room so that she can keep the map for herself. She later calls Batman to her house in order to turn the would-be thief over to the police, but discovers that Kitrina had managed to free herself and steal back the map. This impresses Selina, who mentions that she had tied up the child using an &quot;inescapable&quot; knot that Bruce had shown her years earlier.

Following a battle with Black Mask and his henchmen, which ends with neither woman being able to claim the bounty, Selina agrees to take on Kitrina as her new sidekick, Catgirl. Once Bruce Wayne returns from his time in the past, he establishes Batman Incorporated, a global team of Batmen. Selina accompanies Batman on a mission to break into Doctor Sivana&#x27;s armory, and later travels with him to Tokyo in order to recruit a Japanese representative for Batman Inc. Catwoman teams up with Batman to stop Harley Quinn from breaking the Joker out of Arkham Asylum. After defeating Harley and the Joker, Catwoman tells Poison Ivy that they are no longer friends, this after Ivy drugged her in an attempt to uncover Batman&#x27;s secret identity.

Shortly afterwards, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn have escaped and set off to pursue revenge on Catwoman for leaving them behind. The two of them found Catwoman and fought her. While they were fighting, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help them. Batman was about to arrest them, but Catwoman helped the two of them escape.

===&quot;The New 52&quot; / &quot;Catwoman&quot; (vol. 4)===
In 2011, DC Comics relaunched its main line of superhero titles under the umbrella &quot;The New 52&quot;, which revised and updated the fictional history of its superhero characters. Catwoman&#x27;s new monthly title now focused on Selina&#x27;s earlier days as Catwoman, though not the identity&#x27;s origins. The series begins with Selina frantically escaping from unknown masked men who are invading her apartment. After flitting from rooftop to rooftop, Selina looks back just in time to see her apartment blown apart by explosives. She turns to her informant, Lola, who often supplies Catwoman with information and various jobs. In this instance, Lola tips Selina off to an unoccupied penthouse where Selina can lie low for a few weeks, as well as a job stealing a painting from Russian mobsters. For this job, Selina infiltrates a Russian club by posing as the bartender. There, she recognizes a man who murdered a friend of hers, and she takes her revenge. Once her cover is blown, Selina dons her Catwoman outfit and fights her way out of the club. It is revealed through Selina&#x27;s inner monologue that she and Batman are lovers, and the premiere issue ends with the first sex scene between the two. Her revised origin in &quot;Catwoman&quot; (vol. 4) #0 draws from &quot;Batman Returns&quot;.

Catwoman is later confronted by Steve Trevor, who offers her a spot on Amanda Waller&#x27;s new Justice League of America. Selina initially refuses, but accepts the offer after Trevor promises to help her track down a woman who has apparently been posing as Selina. It is later revealed that Catwoman was chosen specifically to take down Batman should the JLA ever need to defeat the original Justice League. The teams eventually come into conflict in the publisher&#x27;s &quot;Trinity War&quot; crossover.

In the Earth-Two continuity, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne are married, and their daughter, Helena Wayne, is that universe&#x27;s Robin. In this universe, either Selina has reformed or was never a supervillain in the first place. It is revealed in issue #0 of &quot;Worlds&#x27; Finest&quot; that this Selina was killed while trying to stop what she believed was a human trade ring.

====&quot;Keeper of the Castle&quot; and &quot;Inheritance&quot;====
From 2014 to 2015, science fiction writer Genevieve Valentine took over the series and penned a 10-issue story arc focused on Selina Kyle&#x27;s reign as a Gotham City crime boss. Following events from &quot;Batman Eternal&quot; and preceding those in &quot;Batman&quot; #28, Selina takes over control of the Calabrese crime family, after being revealed as the daughter of Rex Calabrese. During this time she stops wearing the Catwoman costume, prompting Eiko Hasigawa, heir to the rival Hasigawa family, to replace her in the role.

The women confront each other several times, discussing Eiko&#x27;s motivations to dress as Catwoman and whether Selina&#x27;s plans for Gotham and the families are worth the sacrifices required. During one of their encounters, Selina and Eiko kiss, establishing their relationship as a romantic one.

===&quot;DC Universe&quot;===
In June 2016, the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; event again relaunched DC Comics&#x27; entire line of superhero comic book titles with partial revisions of their characters&#x27; fictional histories. Catwoman assumes a prominent role in the third volume of &quot;Batman&quot;. In December 2017, DC Comics ended the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; branding, opting to include everything under a larger &quot;DC Universe&quot; banner and naming, and Catwoman continues to be featured in the third volume of &quot;Batman&quot;. The series reveals Selina Kyle&#x27;s origin through a series of flashbacks and letters exchanged between her and Bruce. Selina&#x27;s parents died when she was young, and she hardly remembers them. She is sent to the Thomas and Martha Wayne Home For the Boys and Girls of Gotham, and even after being placed in various foster homes, Selina would escape to return to the orphanage.

Eventually, Selina takes on the Catwoman persona. During one of her heists, she is approached by the Kite Man to aide the Joker in a gang war against the Riddler, which she refuses. She later aides Batman, with whom she already has a romantic relationship, to spy on the Joker. She is shot from a window, but is unharmed. At some point in the future, her childhood orphanage is bombed by a terrorist group called the Dogs of War. Batman reluctantly arrests Catwoman after all 237 of them are killed, despite Catwoman&#x27;s insistence on her guilt.

Catwoman&#x27;s first appearance following the start of DC Rebirth is in &quot;Batman&quot; (vol. 3) #9, where she is revealed to be imprisoned in Arkham Asylum for the alleged murders of the Dogs of War. Batman is determined to prove her innocence, and makes a deal with Amanda Waller to get her off death row in exchange for her help on a mission to Santa Prisca. The mission to find the Psycho-Pirate is a success, and Batman and Catwoman return to Gotham City. Before Batman can return her to custody, she escapes. Batman investigates the murders of the terrorists that she has been charged with, and deduces that it was in fact Holly Robinson who committed the murders after the terrorists burned down the orphanage she and Selina were raised in. After being attacked by Holly Robinson, Batman is rescued by Catwoman.

Bruce proposes to Selina at the end of &quot;Batman&quot; (vol. 3) #24. In issue #32, Selina asks Bruce to propose to her again, to which she says, &quot;Yes&quot;. The two leave Gotham for Khadym to where Holly Robinson has fled to in order to clear Selina&#x27;s name, ultimately facing Talia al Ghul.

&quot;Batman Annual&quot; (vol. 3) #2 (January 2018) centers on a romantic storyline between Batman and Catwoman, beginning with their initial meetings and acceptance of their shared mutual attraction towards one and another. Towards the end, the story is flash-forwarded to the future, in which Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle are a married couple in their golden years. Bruce receives a terminal medical diagnosis, and Selina cares for him until his death.

On the day of their wedding, Selina decides to call off the wedding as she realises that marrying Bruce would ultimately take away what makes him Batman. This is later revealed to be due to the manipulations of Holly under the instructions of Bane as to finally break Batman of both spirit and will. Subsequently, Selina leaves Gotham and starts a new life in the city of Villa Hermosa, California (&quot;Catwoman&quot; (vol. 5) #1). She faces opposition from the power-hungry Creel family who run Villa Hermosa, specifically First Lady Raina Creel.

She reappears in the &quot;City of Bane&quot; storyline, reuniting with Bruce following his defeat against both Bane and his father Thomas Wayne from the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; reality. They proceed to go to Paris for Bruce to recover, before going to disrupt a shipment of Venom under the jurisdiction of Bane&#x27;s lieutenant, the Magpie. During this, they reconcile and finally determine when they actually first met (Batman believed it to be on a boat when they first met under their alter-egos; whilst Catwoman believed it to be in the streets as their true identities, reminiscent of their meeting in &quot;Batman: Year One&quot;). They subsequently go back to Gotham and defeat all of Batman&#x27;s enemies who had sided with Bane before taking on and defeating Bane himself, at which point the two are taken by Thomas who, in an attempt to finally break Bruce&#x27;s spirit, shows him the corpse of the recently murdered Alfred. However, both Bruce and Selina then defeat Thomas utilizing both Scarface and the Psycho-Pirate.

==Equipment==
===Weapons===
During the Silver Age, Catwoman, like most &quot;Batman&quot; villains, used a variety of themed weapons, vehicles, and equipment, such as a custom cat-themed car called the &quot;Cat-illac&quot;. This usage also appeared in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series. In her Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearances, Catwoman&#x27;s favored weapon is a whip. She wields both a standard bullwhip and a cat o&#x27; nine tails with expert proficiency. She uses the whip because it is a weapon that the user must be trained to use, and therefore it can not be taken from her and used against her in a confrontation. She can also be seen using a pistol against people if her whip is taken from her. Catwoman uses caltrops as an anti-personnel weapon and bolas to entangle opponents at a distance.

Catwoman has also been shown to have various items to restrain her victims, such as rope for binding hands and feet, and a roll of duct tape used to gag her targets, as she has done with various victims during her robberies over the years. Often, especially in the TV series, she uses sleeping gas or knockout darts to subdue victims. Catwoman&#x27;s attractiveness and feminine wiles have also allowed her to take advantage of male opponents.

===Costume===
Catwoman, in her first appearance, wore no costume or disguise at all. It was not until her next appearance that she donned a mask, which was a theatrically face-covering cat-mask that had the appearance of a real cat, rather than a more stylized face mask seen in her later incarnations. Later, she wore a dress with a hood that came with ears, and still later, a catsuit with attached boots and either a domino or glasses-mask.

In the 1960s, Catwoman&#x27;s catsuit was green, which was typical of villains of that era. In the 1990s, she usually wore a mostly purple, skintight catsuit before switching to a black catsuit similar to Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s costume in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, except not haphazardly stitched together.

In recent years, artists have typically depicted Catwoman in some variation of a tight, black bodysuit. Ed Brubaker, the writer behind the 2001 revamp of the character, has stated that Selina&#x27;s current costume was inspired by Emma Peel&#x27;s iconic leather catsuit in &quot;The Avengers&quot; television series. It has a more high tech look, with domino-shaped infrared goggles on her cowl. Many of her costumes have incorporated retractable metal claws on the fingertips of her gloves and sometimes on the toes of her boots. On rare occasions, she has also sported a cat&#x27;s tail.

On May 21, 2018, DC Comics unveiled Selina&#x27;s revamped Catwoman costume designed by comic book writer and artist Joëlle Jones. The new costume is black with openings under her arms and shoulders for mobility along with reinforcement in the middle. Gone are the goggles in favor of a cowl and sleeker, more stylish gloves and boots. Jones, who had been drawing the covers and interior art for &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;″s &quot;Batman&quot; was announced as the writer and artist of a new solo &quot;Catwoman&quot; series (volume 5).

Holly Robinson uses the same costume Selina used prior to &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;.

==Other versions==
===Earth-Two===
In the 1970s comics, the Catwoman of Earth-Two (the parallel Earth that was retroactively declared as the home of DC&#x27;s Golden Age characters) has the same history as her Golden Age counterpart. Selina later reformed in the 1950s (after the events of &quot;Batman&quot; #69) and had married Bruce Wayne; soon afterward, she gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only child, Helena Wayne (the Huntress). &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #197 (April 1983) elaborates upon the Golden Age origin of Catwoman given in &quot;Batman&quot; #62, after Selina reveals that she never suffered from amnesia. It is revealed that Selina Kyle had been in a bad marriage, and eventually decided to leave her husband. However, her husband kept her jewelry in his private vault, and she had to break into it to retrieve it. Selina enjoyed this experience so much she decided to become a professional costumed cat burglar, and thus began a career that repeatedly led to her encountering Batman.

The Earth-Two/Golden Age Selina Kyle eventually dies in the late 1970s after being blackmailed by her former underling &quot;Silky&quot; Cernak into going into action again as Catwoman, as shown in &quot;DC Super-Stars&quot; #17 (December 1977). She was killed when Cernak henchman&#x27;s gun went off and hit her on the chest enough for her to fall from the fourth floor mezzanine. She died in Bruce&#x27;s arms claiming &quot;I did it all for you&quot;. This incident led to Helena Wayne becoming Huntress and bringing Cernak to justice.

===&quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;===
Selina Kyle appears as an aging and somewhat overweight madam in Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot; four times; all are brief. The first time is in a phone message to Bruce (&quot;Selina. Bruce, I&#x27;m lonely.&quot;). Next, she is attacked by the Joker, who uses a mind control drug to convince her to send one of her prostitutes to use the same substance on a governor. The Joker then beats her, dresses her in a Wonder Woman outfit, ties her up and gags her, leaving her for Batman to find. Selina&#x27;s final appearance in the book is at Bruce Wayne&#x27;s funeral, where she yells at Superman, telling him that she knows who killed Bruce. She does not appear in &quot;&quot;, Miller&#x27;s follow-up story, although she is referred to in the prologue written for the trade paperback version, but in the book, Carrie Kelley&#x27;s moniker of &quot;Catgirl&quot; is an homage to Catwoman.

===Prose books===
Two 1990s prose books feature Catwoman: &quot;The Further Adventures of Batman: Volume 3 featuring Catwoman&quot;, a short story anthology with stories written by various authors, and &quot;Catwoman: Tiger Hunt&quot;, a novel. Both books feature a &quot;Batman: Year One&quot;-influenced Catwoman who wears a gray cat costume and was once a prostitute.

===&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;===
Catwoman also made a small cameo in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, mostly accompanying the Riddler; she is predominantly seen, but not much heard in the series. She is not dressed in costume, but appears in the very dress she first wore in &quot;Batman&quot; #1 as the Cat. According to the novelization by Elliot S. Maggin, she runs a multibillion-dollar cosmetics company. An armored, metahuman successor called &quot;Catwoman II&quot; is also featured in the story as one of the &quot;new heroes&quot; who follow the new &quot;man of tomorrow&quot; Magog&#x27;s anti-heroic, violent example.

===&quot;Batman: Digital Justice&quot;===
In the all-digital graphic novel &quot;&quot;, which is set some time in the future long after the original Batman has died, Sheila Romero, also known as the hit pop music star Gata (the Spanish female noun for &quot;cat&quot;) and daughter of the Mayor of Gotham City, is jealous of the new Batman, James Gordon, because media coverage of his activities have been cutting into her airtime. Setting out to learn as much about Batman and his enemies as she can, Gata becomes the new Catwoman. Near the end of the story, Gata and her followers face off against Batman, but the two later fall in love, and Maria Romero, also known as Madame X, tells Sheila that she is really a clone of Maria. Maria confesses that she had planned to transplant her brain into Gata&#x27;s body, but she could not bring herself to do it because she loved her &quot;daughter&quot; too much. Maria then dies in Sheila&#x27;s arms.

===&quot;Elseworlds&quot;===
* In the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; tale &quot;Catwoman: Guardian of Gotham&quot;, Selina Kyle is the daughter of millionaires Thomas and Martha Kyle. Walking home after seeing the film &quot;Cat People&quot;, the young Selina chases after an alley cat and watches in horror as her parents are gunned down by a robber. Selina learns that the crook has stolen a ring she found in a Cracker Jack box and had given to her mother. Years later she becomes Catwoman, the defender of Gotham City, operating out of a Catcave beneath Kyle Manor, aided by a young maid named Brooks (this universe&#x27;s version of Alfred Pennyworth). Her major enemy is a psychopathic criminal named Batman, who beats her entire rogues gallery half-to-death just to get rid of the competition.
* In the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; tale &quot;&quot;, where Batman and his supporting characters are re-invented as a pulp noir detective story, an African-American Selina Kyle is a murdered owner of the bankrupt Kit Kat Club who was blackmailing many of the city&#x27;s most powerful figures. She is nicknamed &quot;the Catwoman&quot;.
* In the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; tale &quot;Batman/Tarzan: Claws of the Cat-woman&quot;, set in the 1930s, explorer and adventurer Finnegan Dent is revealed to be stealing the sacred artifacts of an African tribe. During an encounter with Batman and Tarzan, a female thief, dressed as a cat, is revealed to be the princess of the tribe, as well as the priestess of its cat-cult, trying to reclaim the artifacts.
* In the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; tale &quot;&quot;, featuring a world where costumed heroes have no symbol of inspiration as Superman was never recovered by the Kents, Catwoman is diagnosed by the head warden of Arkham Asylum as not being a true &quot;criminal&quot;, but simply enjoying playing a &quot;cat-and-mouse&quot; game with Batman, donning her costume simply to attract his attention. During her time in Arkham, the Joker attacks the asylum armed with Kryptonian gauntlets provided by the story&#x27;s secret villain, forcing the inmates to fight each other—Catwoman being the last one standing—before Batman arrives. Although the Joker uses his gauntlets to brutally murder Robin and Batgirl while forcing Batman to watch, Catwoman distracts him long enough for Batman to escape the Joker&#x27;s hold and destroy the gauntlets. He then proceeds to kill the Joker in a trauma-induced rage, taking the gauntlets and Catwoman back to the Batcave. With Selina and Alfred having broken through Batman&#x27;s grief, Selina becomes Batwoman and joins Batman in rescuing the JLA from captivity. Although Batman resigns from the League after he is cleared of the Joker&#x27;s murder, even Catwoman&#x27;s support cannot help him past his grief until the events of &quot;&quot;, where the two briefly travel into the afterlife to investigate recent supernatural disturbances with the aid of Deadman, with Batgirl and Robin&#x27;s spirits appearing to forgive their mentor for his failure to save them before he returns to life.
* In the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; tale &quot;&quot;, featuring a world if Bruce Wayne discovered the body of dying alien Abin Sur, instead of Green Lantern Hal Jordan, also features familiar Batman characters mixed with some of Green Lantern&#x27;s enemies. Selina Kyle (recognized by Bruce as &quot;that night in the East End&quot;, a reference to &quot;&quot;&quot;), along with Harvey Dent are corrupted by Sinestro, who absorbs the mind of the Waynes&#x27; killer Joe Chill and became crazed. The two known as Star Sapphire (Selina) and Binary Star (Harvey) team with Sinestro to take out Green Lantern, but are stopped.

===&quot;Batman: Bloodstorm&quot;===
In &quot;Batman: Bloodstorm&quot;, the first of two sequels to &quot;Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain&quot;, where Batman was forced to become a vampire to save Gotham from an attack by Dracula, Selina is turned into a werecat after being bitten by one of the remaining vampires. Hunting for the monster that transformed her, Selina encounters Batman as he hunts for the remaining vampires, the two subsequently joining forces to eliminate the vampire horde. As they fight together, Batman finds that Selina&#x27;s selfless love for him allows him to control his thirst for blood that had begun to consume him. She sacrifices herself to save him from the Joker, who had become the leader of the remaining vampires after Dracula&#x27;s death, taking a crossbow bolt to the heart that the Joker had fired at Batman. Batman&#x27;s grief and rage over her death causes him to finally lose control of his bloodlust as he drinks the Joker&#x27;s blood. In the second and final sequel, &quot;Batman: Crimson Mist&quot;, the corrupted Batman reflects grimly that he can no longer understand Selina&#x27;s noble sacrifice after his psyche has become increasingly corrupted by his surrender to his vampire side.

===&quot;Thrillkiller&quot;===
In Howard Chaykin&#x27;s &quot;Thrillkiller&quot;, Selina Kyle is a stripper in a cat-themed strip club. She acts as an informant for GCPD detective Bruce Wayne.

===&quot;Dark Allegiances&quot;===
In Howard Chaykin&#x27;s &quot;Dark Allegiances&quot;, Selina Kyle becomes a film star under the stage name of Kitty Grimalkin. Prior to becoming a star, she was an alcoholic whose actions during one of her &quot;blackouts&quot; were recorded into an underground porn film. The stills from the film are used to blackmail her into stealing information from Wayne Enterprises.

===&quot;Batman: Shadow of the Bat&quot;===
In Alan Grant&#x27;s &quot; Annual&quot; #2, Vikki Vale, a reporter for Wayne Media, is Catwoman. She is hired by Anarky to steal information, but she gets caught and is tortured by Jonathan Crane, whom she calls a &quot;demented scarecrow&quot;.

===&quot;All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder&quot;===
In Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder&quot;, Catwoman expresses interest when the Joker&#x27;s invites her to join him in &quot;some mischief&quot;. She may be involved in sadomasochism, as she first advises the Joker — who has just murdered his latest lover—that &quot;I&#x27;ve heard rumors on how you handle women — and even I don&#x27;t play it that rough&quot;. Two issues later, however, Catwoman is found brutally beaten and cut, bleeding badly. She struggles to tell Batman, &quot;Juh... Juh... It was Juh...&quot;

===&quot;Batman: Two Faces&quot;===
In Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Selina Kyle is a madame in 19th century Gotham, who defends streetwalkers in a mask, bustier, and fishnets and occasionally works with amateur detective Bruce Wayne.

===&quot;Batman: Leatherwing&quot;===
In &quot;Detective Comics Annual&quot; #7 (&quot;&quot;) by Chuck Dixon, set in the 18th century Caribbean, Capitana Felina is a Spanish Contessa turned pirate, who rails against the chauvinism of her own crew. She initially teams up with the Laughing Man (the Joker) against the English freebooter Captain Leatherwing (Batman), before turning to Leatherwing&#x27;s side, and eventually marrying him.

===&quot;Batman Beyond&quot;===
A futuristic Catwoman appears in &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; (vol. 3). Like the current Batman, Terry McGinnis, the new Catwoman sports a high-tech costume complete with advanced gadgetry. The new Hush hires her to plant a tracking device on Batman, only for Hush to begin strangling her after &quot;paying&quot; her with a box full of playing cards, regarding her death as a continuation of his efforts to destroy Batman&#x27;s &quot;family&quot; by killing his rogues gallery. Bruce Wayne saves her with &#x27;Bat-Wraith&#x27; robots. She is revealed to be the daughter of the villain Multiplex; she inherits her father&#x27;s ability to self-duplicate, but can only create nine copies of herself, explaining her adoption of the Catwoman moniker. She is later revealed to be intimately involved with Dick Grayson.

===&quot;Flashpoint&quot;===
In the alternate timeline of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; event, Selina Kyle becomes the Oracle, having been apparently paralyzed under unspecified circumstances.

===&quot;Scooby-Doo Team-Up&quot;===
During a crossover with the cast of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, Catwoman poses as a ghost in order to con Harley and Ivy out of the Opal of Isis, a rare artifact. After the members of Mystery, Inc. unravel her scam, Catwoman tries to flee with the opal. She is soon found bound and gagged, with Batgirl having managed to defeat her and reclaim the opal off-screen.

===Earth 2===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; revised and relaunched DC Comics superhero titles, including revisions to the alternate-universe stories and characters of &quot;Earth-Two&quot;—renamed &quot;Earth-2&quot;. The Earth 2 version of Catwoman is married to Batman and is the mother of Helena Wayne. Catwoman trained her daughter in crimefighting so that she can one day aid her father, who is busy protecting the world from bigger threats. Batman found out about the outing and got angry, only for Catwoman to calm him down and kiss him. Helena later came to her father&#x27;s aid and found that soldiers from another world killed Catwoman as Batman mourns her death.

===&quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot;===
In 2021, DC announced that it would be releasing a comic book continuation of Tim Burton&#x27;s first two &quot;Batman&quot; films, &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot;, written by Sam Hamm, and illustrated by Joe Quinones.

Cavan County Council is the local authority for the county, which had a population of 81,704 at the 2022 census.

==Geography==
Cavan borders six counties: Leitrim to the west, Fermanagh to the north, Monaghan to the north-east, Meath to the south-east, Longford to the south-west and Westmeath to the south.

==History==

From around the thirteenth century the area (Cavan) was part of the petty kingdom of East Bréifne anglicized Breffny O&#x27;Reilly after its then ruling Gaelic family. This in turn was the east division Kingdom of Bréifne. For this reason the county is colloquially known as the Breffni County. A high degree of defense was achieved by using the natural landscape of drumlin hills and loughs. The poorly drained heavy clay soils contributed as an obstacle against invasion.

From the late twelfth century East Breifne were subjected to Norman influence and the remains of several motte and bailie fortifications are still visible, as well as the remains of stronger works such as Castlerahan and Clogh Oughter castle. The growing influence of several monastic orders in the new diocese called &quot;Tir Briuin Breifne&quot; from the mid twelfth century with abbey remains existent in locations such as Drumlane and later Trinity Island.

Historically, the &quot;Ui Briuin&quot; Kingdom of Breifne was part of the western province of Connacht ruled over by the O&#x27;Rourke clan until around 1256 when under Norman occupation the kingdom was split in half. West Breifne still ruled by O&#x27;Rourkes and East Breifni ruled by O&#x27;Reillys. During the sixteenth century in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I the county of Cavan was formed and transferred to Ulster from 1584, following the composition of Breifne. In the south, the Lough Sheelin area was part of Leinster until the late 14th century.

Under James VI and I, from 1610 the Plantation of Ulster saw the settlement and origins of several new towns within the county that include Bailieborough, Cootehill, Killeshandra and Virginia. Existing towns such as Cavan and Belturbet became over time more important as trading centres. Wars during the mid-seventeenth century aimed at trying to unsettle the Plantation only led to further plantations of English and Scottish settlers into the county, bringing with them better farming methods and the beginnings of a thriving flax and linen industry.

Some areas of Cavan were hard hit by the Great Famine potato blight between 1845 and 1849. The winter of 1847 is particularly noted for the high levels of deaths nationally caused by diseases such as typhus and cholera. Several instances of eviction also occurred during the nineteenth century, with one such story where the local landlord in Mountnugent parish decided to evict over 200 people. The famous ballad &quot;By Lough Sheelin Side&quot; is based on this event witnessed by the local Catholic priest.

Edward Saunderson, founder of the Ulster Unionist Council, was born in the county. However, when the Irish Unionist Party met on 9 June 1916, the delegates from Cavan learnt that they would not be included in any &quot;temporary exclusion of Ulster&quot; from Home Rule; they agreed only with very great reluctance.

===Rail===
In the mid-1850s the Midland Great Western Railway built a line between the Inny Junction in County Westmeath (along their expanding network which was eventually to reach Sligo) and Cavan town. The first railway station to open in Cavan, was Cavan railway station in 1856. Many notable railway stations were built in the 19th century such as Kingscourt railway station and the Cavan and Leitrim Railway. The railways were an important part of the economic development of Cavan and carried passengers and freight to all over Ireland. The railways also helped the popularity of GAA in Cavan grow, spectators could travel easily between towns.

After World War II, due to the shortage of coal in the country, uneconomic lines were terminated. In 1947 all passenger services were terminated though the transport of freight and livestock continued. The Great Northern Railway (G.N.R.) continued to serve the Cavan and Leitrim Railway. However, in 1959 all services along the remaining rail lines were terminated and the stations along their routes were closed.

Belturbet railway station is open as a railway museum.

===Water===
In the historical context and before water levels in lakes were lowered, water transport in the region was once very important through the complex of lakes and waterways that fed into the major river systems such as the Erne, Shannon and Boyne. Today however this is mainly confined to leisure craft on the River Erne and Shannon-Erne Waterway from Belturbet and Ballyconnell as well as for angling activities. Cavan also has 365 lakes all around, one for everyday of the year.

They compete in division 3B of the National Hurling League and in the Lory Meagher Cup.

The first GAA club founded in Cavan was Ballyconnell in 1885. However the club didn&#x27;t affiliate to GAA Central Council until March 1886 so that can be taken as the founding of the GAA in Cavan and Ulster.

The Pentatomoidea are characterised by a well-developed scutellum (the hardened extension of the thorax over the abdomen). It can be triangular to semielliptical in shape. The antennae typically have five segments. The tarsi usually have two or three segments.

Shield bugs have glands that produce a foul-smelling liquid, which is used defensively to deter potential predators. Nymphs have glands on the dorsal surface of the abdomen (dorsal abdominal scent glands). These are often present in adults as well, but adults also develop a pair of glands on the metathorax (third segment of the thorax), these being the metathoracic scent glands.

The nymphs and adults have distinctive piercing mouthparts, with mandibles and maxillae modified to form a piercing &quot;stylet&quot; sheathed within a modified labium. The stylet is used to suck sap from plants, or in some cases to suck blood from other animals, such as in the predatory subfamily Asopinae.

Pentatomoidea are mostly phytophagous, although some (the Asopinae or predatory stink bugs) are zoophagous. They can become significant pests (e.g. the brown marmorated stink bug), causing economic damage to certain crops.

==Families==
These families are classified under Pentatomoidea:

===Extant===
*Acanthosomatidae – known as shield bugs, contains 46 genera and 184 species found worldwide
*Canopidae – found strictly in the Neotropical realm
*Cydnidae – known as burrowing bugs, it contains 120 genera and about 765 species worldwide.
*Dinidoridae – found in tropical Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America, composed of 16 genera and about 65 species
*Lestoniidae – small, round bugs that bear a resemblance to tortoise beetles (Chrysomelidae), composed only of one genus and two species, endemic to Australia
*Megarididae – contains only one extant genus (&quot;Megaris&quot;) and 16 species, small, globular bugs occurring in Central America
*Parastrachiidae – bright red and black bugs exhibiting maternal care of eggs, it contains only two genera: &quot;Dismegistus&quot; (Africa) and &quot;Parastrachia&quot; (Eastern Asia).
*Pentatomidae – known as stink bugs, it is the largest family in Pentatomoidea. It contains around 900 genera and over 4700 species.
*Phloeidae – large mottled brown and flattened bugs found strictly in the Neotropical realm. It is composed on only 2 genera and 3 species. They are known to exhibit strong maternal care.
*Plataspidae – found in Asia, particularly eastern Asia, although a few species of &quot;Coptosoma&quot; occur in the Palearctic. They are round plant-feeding bugs. It has about 59 genera and 560 species. 
*Saileriolidae – only recently removed from inclusion within Urostylididae.
*Scutelleridae – known as jewel bugs or shield-backed bugs. Composed of 81 genera and about 450 species.
*Tessaratomidae – known as giant shield bugs because they are usually relatively large. Has about 55 genera and 240 species worldwide (mainly in the Old World tropics). 
*Thaumastellidae – small bugs usually found under rocks in tropical Africa and the Middle East. It contains only one genus and three species. There is some debate to their inclusion within Pentatomoidea.
*Thyreocoridae – includes the former family, subfamily Corimelaeninae – known as ebony bugs, they are small, oval, shiny black bugs.
*Urostylididae – contains about 11 genera and 170 species. They are found in Southern and Eastern Asia.

===Extinct===
*†Mesopentacoridae Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, Asia
*†Primipentatomidae – family with about four Early Cretaceous fossil species from China.
*†Probascanionidae Handlirsch 1921 Monotypic, Early Jurassic, Germany
*†Protocoridae Handlirsch 1906 Early-Middle Jurassic, Eurasia
*†Venicoridae Yao et al. 2012 Early Cretaceous, China
