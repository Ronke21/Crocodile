<text>Paul Marlor Sweezy (April 10, 1910 – February 27, 2004) was a Marxist economist, political activist, publisher, and founding editor of the long-running magazine &quot;Monthly Review&quot;. He is best remembered for his contributions to economic theory as one of the leading Marxian economists of the second half of the 20th century.

==Biography==


===Early years and education===
Paul Sweezy was born on April 10, 1910 in New York City, the youngest of three sons of Everett B. Sweezy, a vice-president of First National Bank of New York. His mother, Caroline Wilson Sweezy, was a graduate of Goucher College in Baltimore.

Sweezy attended Phillips Exeter Academy and went on to Harvard and was editor of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;, graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1932. Having completed his undergraduate coursework, his interests shifted from journalism to economics. Sweezy spent the 1931–32 academic year taking courses at the London School of Economics, traveling to Vienna to study on breaks. It was at this time that Sweezy was first exposed to Marxian economic ideas. He made the acquaintance of Harold Laski, Joan Robinson and other young left-wing British thinkers of the day.

Upon his return to the United States, Sweezy again enrolled at Harvard, from which he received his PhD degree in 1937 for a thesis on an English mineowners&#x27; cartel, &quot;The Limitation of the Vend: A Study in Monopoly and Competition&quot;. During his studies, Sweezy had become the &quot;&quot;ersatz&quot; son&quot; (&quot;ersatz&quot; meaning &quot;replacement&quot; in German) of the Austrian-born economist Joseph Schumpeter, although on an intellectual level, their views were diametrically opposed. Later, as colleagues, their debates on the &quot;Laws of Capitalism&quot; were of legendary status for a generation of Harvard economists.

While at Harvard, Sweezy founded the academic journal &quot;The Review of Economic Studies&quot; and published essays on imperfect competition, the role of expectations in the determination of supply and demand, and the problem of economic stagnation.

===Academic career and military service===
Sweezy became an instructor at Harvard in 1938. It was there that he helped establish a local branch of the American Federation of Teachers, the Harvard Teachers&#x27; Union. In this interval also Sweezy wrote lectures that later became one of his most important works of economics, &quot;The Theory of Capitalist Development&quot; (1942), a book which summarized the labor theory of value of Marx and his followers. The book was the first in English to deal with such questions as the transformation problem thoroughly.

Sweezy worked for several New Deal agencies analyzing the concentration of economic power and the dynamics of monopoly and competition. This research included the influential study for the National Resources Committee, &quot;Interest Groups in the American Economy&quot; which identified the eight most powerful financial-industrial alliances in US business.

From 1942 to 1945, Sweezy worked for the research and analysis division of the Office of Strategic Services. Sweezy was sent to London, where his work for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) required his monitoring British economic policy for the US government. He went on to edit the OSS&#x27;s monthly publication, &quot;European Political Report&quot;. Sweezy received the bronze star for his role in the war. He was the recipient of the Social Science Research Council Demobilization Award at war&#x27;s end.
On December 14, 2016, the U.S. Congress &quot;awarded the Congressional Gold Medal collectively to the members of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in recognition of their superior and major contributions during World War II&quot;. 

Sweezy wrote extensively for the liberal press during the post-war period, including such publications as &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;The New Republic,&quot; among others. He also wrote a book, &quot;Socialism,&quot; published in 1949, as well as a number of shorter pieces which were collected in book form as &quot;The Present as History&quot; in 1953. In 1947 Sweezy quit his teaching position at Harvard, with two years remaining on his contract, to dedicate himself to full-time writing and editing.

===&quot;Monthly Review&quot; magazine===
In 1949, Sweezy and Leo Huberman founded a new magazine called &quot;Monthly Review,&quot; using money from historian and literary critic F. O. Matthiessen. The first issue appeared in May of that year, and included Albert Einstein&#x27;s article &quot;Why Socialism?&quot;. The magazine, established in the midst of the American Red Scare, describes itself as socialist &quot;independent of any political organization&quot;.

&quot;Monthly Review&quot; rapidly expanded into the production of books and pamphlets through its publishing arm, Monthly Review Press.

Over the years, &quot;Monthly Review&quot; published articles by a diverse array of voices, including material by Albert Einstein, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jean-Paul Sartre, Che Guevara and Joan Robinson.

===Activism===
In 1954, New Hampshire Attorney General Louis C. Wyman subpoenaed Sweezy and made inquiries into the contents of a guest lecture at the University of New Hampshire and his political beliefs and associations, demanding to know the names of his political associates. Sweezy refused to comply, citing his First Amendment right of freedom of expression. He was cited for contempt of court and briefly imprisoned, but the US Supreme Court overturned the conviction in a landmark case for academic freedom, in &quot;Sweezy v. New Hampshire&quot;, .

Sweezy was active in a wide range of progressive causes, including the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, the National Lawyers Guild, the National Council of Arts, Sciences and Professions, and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He was the chairman of the Committee in Defense of Carl Marzani and was particularly active fighting against the prosecution of members of the Communist Party under the Smith Act.

An outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War, Sweezy was a prominent supporter of Bertrand Russell&#x27;s International War Crimes Tribunal.

===Contributions to economics===
Sweezy&#x27;s work in economics focused on applying Marxist analysis to what he identified as three dominant trends in modern capitalism: monopolization, stagnation, and financialization.

Sweezy&#x27;s first formally published paper on economics was a 1934 article entitled &quot;Professor Pigou&#x27;s Theory of Unemployment,&quot; published in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; in 1934. Over the rest of the decade Sweezy wrote prolifically on economics-related topics, publishing some 25 articles and reviews. Sweezy did pioneering work in the fields of expectations and oligopoly in these years, introducing for the first time the concept of the kinked demand curve in the determination of oligopoly pricing.

Harvard published Sweezy&#x27;s dissertation, &quot;Monopoly and Competition in the English Coal Trade, 1550–1850&quot;, in 1938. With the 1942 publication of The Theory of Capitalist Development, Sweezy established himself as the &quot;dean of American Marxists&quot; and laid foundations for later Marxist work on these themes. In addition to presenting the first major discussion of the &quot;transformation problem&quot; in English, the book also emphasized the &quot;qualitative&quot; as well as &quot;quantitative&quot; aspect of Marx&#x27;s theory of value, distinguishing Marx&#x27;s approach from those of his predecessors in political economy.

In 1966, Sweezy published &quot;Monopoly Capital: An Essay on the American Economic and Social Order&quot; with Paul Baran. The book elaborated evidence for and implications of Sweezy&#x27;s stagnation theory, also called secular stagnation. The main dilemma modern capitalism would face, they argued, would be how to find profitable investment outlets for the economic surpluses created by capital accumulation. Because of the increase in oligopoly this took the form of stagnation as monopolistic firms reduced output rather than prices in response to overcapacity.

Oligopoly meant there was a tendency for the rate of surplus to rise, but this surplus did not necessarily register in statistical records as profits. It also takes the form of waste and excess production capacity.

Increases in marketing, defense spending and various forms of debt could alleviate the problem of overaccumulation. However, they believed that these remedies to capital&#x27;s difficulties were inherently limited and tend to decrease in effectiveness over time so that monopoly capital would tend toward economic stagnation.

This book is regarded as the cornerstone of Sweezy&#x27;s contribution to Marxian economics.

Sweezy had dealt with the rise and fall of finance capital in the early 21st century identifying monopoly as the more essential trend. This formed the context in which he would analyze the resurgence of finance capital in the post-war era. Because Sweezy&#x27;s approach combined and integrated the micro effects of monopoly with the macro level insights of Keynesian theory it proved superior for understanding the stagflation of the 1970s. Sweezy&#x27;s later work with Harry Magdoff examined the importance of &quot;financial explosion&quot; as a response to stagnation.

===Death and legacy===
Paul Sweezy died on February 27, 2004, at the age of 93.

He was survived by his second wife, Nancy, his third wife, Zyrel, and his three children, Samuel, Lybess and Martha.

Sweezy was lauded by economist and public intellectual John Kenneth Galbraith as &quot;the most noted American Marxist scholar&quot; of the late 20th Century. He was also called &quot;the best that Exeter and Harvard can produce&quot; and regarded as &quot;among the most promising economists of his generation&quot; by Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson.

=== Relevance in 2008 Financial Crash and subsequent years of global economic turmoil ===
Sweezy and Baran&#x27;s Monopoly Capital once again came into fashion as a guideline for the 2008 financial troubles as surplus productivity was malinvested into the financial sector and &quot;financialization&quot; of western companies over productive benefits of industry. Post 2008, consolidating corporate powers with aid from United States government policies continue to roll surpluses of productivity into militaristic ventures across the world in order to monopolize more industries such as media, banking, real estate, pharmaceutical, and technology to control pricing across commodities and services and labor. &quot;...capitalist opposition to civilian spending as a threat to their class interests and class power limited the ability of such spending to provide effective demand.&quot;

The increasing concentration and centralization of capital, the rise of giant corporate conglomerates (as seen in Japan since the 80&#x27;s deflationary period began) forced effective demand to decline. Sweezy maintained, as new investment is restricted to defend the rate of profit,

<text>U.S. Route 60 is a major east–west United States highway, traveling from southwestern Arizona to the Atlantic Ocean coast in Virginia. 
The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where it is known as General Booth Boulevard, just south of the city&#x27;s Oceanfront resort district at the intersection of Rudee Point Road and Harbor Point. Its original western terminus was in Springfield, Missouri; it was then extended to Los Angeles, California, but in 1964, it was truncated to end southwest of Brenda, Arizona, at an interchange with Interstate 10 (I-10) after the US 60 highway designation was removed from California. I-10 replaced US 60 from Beaumont, California, to Arizona, and California State Route 60 (SR 60) replaced US 60 from Los Angeles to Beaumont.

=== Arizona ===
The westernmost stretch of US 60, to the California state line, has been replaced by Interstate 10 (I-10). The western terminus of US 60 is near Brenda, from where it travels northeast to Wickenburg. Once US 60 enters Surprise, it carries the name Grand Avenue through the Phoenix metropolitan area before joining I-17 and I-10 in Phoenix for approximately . In Tempe, US 60 exits I-10 and becomes the Superstition Freeway, a significant part of the Phoenix freeway system that serves cities such as Mesa, Gilbert, and Apache Junction. East of the Phoenix area, US 60 bears roughly east-northeast through mountainous areas, passing through Globe, Show Low, and Springerville before entering New Mexico.

=== New Mexico ===

US 60 enters New Mexico in Catron County east of Springerville, Arizona. The road makes an arc through Catron County, with the apex at Quemado, avoiding Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest and Escondido Mountain. East of Pie Town, the road crosses the Continental Divide. Between the Divide and Datil, US 60 cuts through the Datil Mountains and Cibola National Forest. In Datil, US 60 serves as the eastern terminus of NM-12.

East of Datil, US 60 traverses the northern end of the Plains of San Augustin, then crosses the county line into Socorro County. The road bisects the Very Large Array complex, and a track used in rearranging the antennas that make up the Array crosses the highway. into the county, the highway passes through Magdalena.
It then enters the county seat of Socorro, where it meets Interstate 25. US 60 heads north, beginning a concurrency with the Interstate.

US 60 splits off from I-25 near Bernardo, about north of Socorro. It turns back eastward, rising through Abo Pass at the southern end of the Manzano Mountains before crossing into Torrance County and passing through Mountainair, where it intersects NM-55. After passing through Willard, it sets out across the Pedernal Hills. In Encino, it begins a concurrency with US-285. Just after crossing into Guadalupe County, US-54 joins the concurrency. The three highways pass through Vaughn and then go their separate ways, with US 285 heading southeast towards the direction of Roswell, US 54 heading northeast towards both Santa Rosa and Interstate 40, and US 60 heading east towards Clovis.

US 60 angles southeast toward Yeso, entering De Baca County en route. Curving back towards the east, the road enters Fort Sumner, the county seat, later. Just west of town, it serves as the northern terminus of NM-20, and in Fort Sumner proper, it begins a concurrency with US-84, which will persist for the remainder of the routes&#x27; miles in New Mexico. East of town the two highways encounter NM-212, a spur to Fort Sumner State Monument, and NM 252 in Taiban.

US 60/84 passes through Tolar near the De Baca–Roosevelt County line. The two routes do not stay in Roosevelt County for long, however, proceeding into Curry County west of Melrose. The highways pass through Melrose, St. Vrain, and Grier before widening out to a four-lane highway as they approach Clovis, the Curry County seat. In Clovis, the home of Cannon Air Force Base, the highways meet up with US-70, which joins the concurrency. The three highways proceed through Texico, and then cross the state line near Farwell, Texas.

For the distance of more than 300 miles (480 km) between Abo Pass and Amarillo, the highway parallels the Southern Transcon, one of the busiest transcontinental railroads in the west.

=== Texas ===

US 60 runs in a northeasterly direction across the Texas Panhandle. It enters the state as a four-lane divided highway at Farwell on the Texas-New Mexico border, and heads northeast, intersecting U.S. Route 385 at Hereford. At Canyon, the route begins a concurrency with both U.S. Route 87 and Interstate 27; the three routes are united to Amarillo.

At Amarillo, the road crosses Interstate 40 and has a short concurrency with Historic US 66 on Amarillo Boulevard. The road continues as a divided highway, heading northeast to Pampa, where the road goes to two lanes. At Canadian, the route briefly returns to four-lane status and forms a concurrency with U.S. Route 83. US 60 leaves Texas for Oklahoma east of Higgins.

=== Oklahoma ===

Except for three short sections near Enid, Vinita, and Ponca City, US 60 is a two-lane highway its entire length across Oklahoma. It enters the state west of Arnett and travels east to Orienta where it begins a concurrency with U.S. Highway 412. At Enid, it leaves the concurrency with US-412 and begins another with U.S. Highway 64 with which it is united for . Near Tonkawa, US 60 has an interchange with Interstate 35.

At Ponca City, US 60 enters Osage County, leaving it at Bartlesville. From Vinita to Afton, the highway has a concurrency with Historic U.S. Highway 66 and U.S. Highway 69. The road meets Interstate 44 at Vinita and Afton. It passes through Twin Bridges State Park about west of the Missouri state line.

=== Missouri ===

US 60 crosses southern Missouri, south of Interstate 44. It crosses the Missouri-Oklahoma state line near the Missouri town Seneca. It is concurrent with U.S. Route 62 from Charleston and spans the Mississippi River to enter Illinois. Prior to the creation of the U.S. Highway system, U.S. Route 60 was Route 16.

Between the Missouri-Oklahoma state line and south of Seneca and Republic, US 60 is a two-lane highway, often splitting into alternating three-lane highways beginning at Monett. At Republic, the road becomes a four-lane divided highway, turning southeast onto the James River Freeway in the Springfield city limits.
Most of the route east of Springfield is four-lane divided and several stretches are freeway-graded. On July 9, 2010, The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) finished the process of upgrading US 60 to four lanes along a segment between the towns of Willow Springs and Van Buren. This project&#x27;s overall completion indicates that US 60 is now a four-lane facility from Springfield to Charleston, a distance of approximately . A stretch of US 60 from east of US 65 in Springfield to Rogersville has been in long range plans on being upgraded to freeway status, therefore removing all at-grade crossings, installing overpasses and interchanges, and access roads.

At Mansfield, US 60 meets Missouri Route 5, which runs south towards Ava. U.S. 60 is briefly concurrent with Route 5 north of Mansfield, after which Route 5 continues north towards Hartville. On the southeast side of Cabool US 60 encounters US Route 63 and continues as a concurrency to Willow Springs, where the two routes separate with Route 60 continuing east to Mountain View and Route 63 continues south toward West Plains.

US 60 intersects Interstate 55 and Interstate 57 just southeast of Sikeston. It runs concurrently with I-57 from this junction to the east side of Charleston.

From Charleston to Bird&#x27;s Point, where the route leaves Missouri on a bridge crossing of the Mississippi River, US 60 is now concurrent with U.S. Route 62 and - for a short distance - Route 77.

William Jefferson Blythe Jr., the biological father of former U.S. president Bill Clinton, died on Route 60 (now Route 114) outside of Sikeston, Missouri after being thrown from his car and drowning in a drainage ditch.

=== Illinois ===

U.S. 60 continues its concurrency with U.S. Highway 62 for its entire length, , in Illinois. The routes enter Illinois at its very southern tip between the Mississippi and Ohio rivers.

The concurrent routes pass Fort Defiance, which lies at the lowest and southernmost point of Illinois, then intersect with U.S. 51 south of Cairo, turning eastward along with southbound U.S. 51 to cross the Ohio River into Kentucky.

=== Kentucky ===

US 60, along with US 51 and US 62, crosses into the Commonwealth of Kentucky from Cairo, Illinois. US 60 splits off from this concurrency at Wickliffe, and heads northeast towards Paducah. US 60 has an interchange with Interstate 24 and enters the city along with Business Loop 24. US 60 joins US 62 once again, and the routes head out of Paducah. US 60 splits off to the northeast and crosses the Tennessee River, while US 62 heads southeast and serves as the western terminus of US 68.

From there, US 60 roughly follows the Ohio River, traveling through the city of Smithland, and junctions US 641 at Marion. US 60 continues northeast to Morganfield, and then to Henderson, where it joins US 41-A on the west side of town. The two routes head to northeast Henderson, where they have an interchange with US 41. Currently, Kentucky&#x27;s segment of Interstate 69 ends south of Henderson, but construction has begun to connect it with Indiana, the interstate will be concurrent with US 41 and share the rebuilt interchange with US 60. From the interchange, US 60 heads east towards the city of Owensboro.

US 60 becomes the Wendell H. Ford Expressway, around the south side of the city of Owensboro. The route serves as the eastern terminus of the Audubon Parkway (future I-69 spur), as well as the northern terminus of US 431. US 231 joins US 60 and the routes serve as the northern terminus of I-165 (formerly the William H. Natcher Parkway). The routes travel north, leaving Owensboro, towards Maceo. At Maceo, US 60 splits from US 231 and heads east along the Ohio River traveling through the cities of Lewisport, Hawesville, and Cloverport. The route then goes southeast to Hardinsburg, and then traverses northeast to US 31W north of Fort Knox.

US 60 joins US 31W, and the routes travel north to the city of Louisville. US 60 branches off an alternate route, Alt. US 60, which traverses the south side of Louisville, while the main US 60 travels through the north side. The routes head north through the city, having an interchange with I-264 along the way. At Bernheim Lane, US 31W splits off US 60 and parallels on the west side, while US 60 continues north, traveling further into the city. US 60 joins US 150, and the routes travel east out of the downtown area. The routes junction US 31E, and US 60 goes north on US 31E, while US 150 goes south on US 31E. Then, US 60 turns off onto US 42, has an interchange with Interstate 64, and then splits off of US 42 and heads out of Louisville. Before leaving, Alternate US 60 joins back, and US 60 has an interchange with I-264 once more, and then with I-265.

US 60 parallels Interstate 64 as the route travels east through Shelbyville, and on into the capital city of Frankfort. Here, US 60 junctions US 127, and heads on east into the city. US 60 crosses the Kentucky River and continues east to US 421 and US 460. US 60 joins US 421, and the routes travel south for a bit, and then US 421 splits off of US 60 and heads east. US 60 heads southeast, crossing over to the south side of Interstate 64. US 60 joins US 62 once again in a strange concurrency (US 60 is heading east while US 62 is heading west, and vice versa). US 60 quickly splits off at Versailles, and then the route travels east towards Lexington.

US 60 enters Lexington after having an interchange with Kentucky Route 4 (KY 4). US 60 goes into the city, joining US 68 for a block, and then turns south onto US 25 and US 421. The three routes travel through downtown Lexington, and then US 60 splits off and heads east out of the city. On its way out, US 60 has an interchange with US 421 By-Pass and then with Interstate 75.

US 60 continues on east, paralleling Interstate 64. The route travels through Winchester, and then junctions US 460 in Mount Sterling. After leaving the city, US 60 crosses over to the north side of Insterstate 64, creating an interchange. From here, US 60 travels through the cities of Owingsville, Morehead, and Grayson, before turning northeast to head to the city of Ashland. In the city, US 60 joins US 23, and the two routes head south along the Ohio River. The routes continue to Catlettsburg, where US 60 leaves US 23 and heads east, crossing over the Big Sandy River on the Billy C. Clark Bridge into the state of West Virginia.

=== West Virginia ===

In West Virginia, US 60 largely follows the path of the Midland Trail. It enters the state at Kenova by crossing over the Big Sandy River from the city of Catlettsburg, Kentucky. From there, it heads through Huntington east to Charleston.

From Charleston, US 60 heads southeast on its own course apart from Interstate 64, its replacement. The road first follows the Kanawha River to its source at Gauley Bridge, where US 60 then climbs out of the river valley and follows a twisting path through Rainelle and back to Interstate 64 at Sam Black Church. This stretch was the last section of US 60 to be bypassed by the Interstate system in West Virginia. I-64 between Beckley and Sam Black Church, West Virginia, was not completed and open to traffic until July 15, 1988. Due to its location, many miles away from I-64, US 60 still serves a large amount of traffic through the central part of the state, even though I-64 has replaced the highway for most through traffic. From the early 1970s, when I-64 was completed through Charleston to the West Virginia Turnpike until 1988, all east-west I-64 traffic was routed onto the mostly two lane U.S. 60 from Charleston to Sam Black Church where I-64 resumed. During this time U.S. 60 was signed by W.V.D.O.T. with a U.S. 60 shield and a &quot;to I-64 (east or west)&quot; sign in order to assure travelers they would eventually return to the interstate highway by following the federal designated route. This stretch of highway from Charleston to Sam Black Church is significant as it was the second to last segment of U.S. highway to be replaced by an interstate (of the original 1960s grid plan).
From Sam Black Church east through Lewisburg to White Sulphur Springs, US 60 lives in the shadow of I-64 and carries a very small amount of traffic. Just east of White Sulphur Springs, US 60 joins I-64 for the last in the state before they enter Virginia at Allegheny Mountain.

=== Virginia ===

In Virginia, U.S. Route 60 runs west to east through the central part of the state, generally close to and paralleling the Interstate 64 corridor, except for the crossing of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and in the South Hampton Roads area.
Between Lexington in the Shenandoah Valley and Richmond, I-64 uses a lower elevation crossing of the Blue Ridge Mountains located about further north, where it runs parallel to U.S. Route 250 through Rockfish Gap. In contrast, through this section, the older US 60 is mostly a rural two-lane road. With the crossing of the Blue Ridge Mountains at a higher altitude in more rugged terrain, US 60 in this area offers much more challenging and weather-sensitive driving conditions, as well as a history of many crashes in the years before I-64 was completed.

East of north–south U.S. Route 29 (which runs parallel to the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge), the older US 60 and I-64 gradually converge as they pass through the rolling hills of the rocky Piedmont region in an easterly direction to reach the Fall Line at Richmond, where they again become very close.

From Richmond east to the harbor area near the mouth of Hampton Roads, US 60 again essentially parallels I-64 through Williamsburg and the Historic Triangle region, extending down the Virginia Peninsula east to the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel which it shares with I-64. Along the way in Newport News, a notable section of Huntington Avenue (the block between 25th and 26th streets) carries US 60 in both directions overlapping, and is possibly the only example of a highway in the United States with such a configuration. A few miles south of the bridge-tunnel, in Norfolk, US 60 diverges to the east to follow the south shoreline of the Chesapeake Bay through Ocean View and past the south entrance to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel to reach Cape Henry. There it curves south to run along the Atlantic Ocean shoreline to end near the south end of the Virginia Beach resort strip.

=== Historical California alignment===
U.S. Route 60 has been fully decommissioned in California since 1972, when Interstate 10 was completed in California. It had a clear east-west orientation and was so signed.

Between downtown Los Angeles (its western terminus at its interchange with Interstates 5 and 10) it had an existence separate from U.S. Routes 70 and 99, lying to its south. US 60 passed through Pomona and Riverside, meeting US 70 and US 99 near Beaumont, east of which it coincided with US 70 and US 99 as far to the east as Indio. East of Indio, US 99 separated from US 60 and US 70, both continuing through the Colorado Desert to the Arizona state line at the Colorado River near Blythe almost entirely as a two-lane highway.

After the Great Renumbering of 1964, US 60 remained intact east of Beaumont, but for only eight years. Meanwhile, US 70 and US 99 had disappeared completely in Southern California. West of Beaumont, the route that had been US 60 was re-signed as State Route 60 (although often on a somewhat different alignment than the current California 60, as the new freeway had not yet been completed). East of Beaumont, US 60 remained in existence while Interstate 10 supplanted it, with the course of US 60 being moved to Interstate 10 and some sections of the old highway being demolished. In 1972, California decommissioned whatever remained of US 60 within the state as the last segments of Interstate 10 were opened. Parts of old US 60 (which in places coincided with US 70 and US 99) remain as business loops of Interstate 10 in Indio and Blythe.
US 60 had its beginnings in the Midland Trail, an auto trail organized in 1912 by residents of Grand Junction, Colorado. The next year, this route was considered but rejected for the Lincoln Highway, after which the Midland Trail Association laid out and marked its own transcontinental highway, eventually connecting Newport News, Virginia with Los Angeles, California. When the Joint Board on Interstate Highways published its preliminary plan for a system of interstate routes in 1925, the Midland Trail was split among many numbers, including 52, 62, 150, 50, and 40. East of Louisville, where it would become US 60, it was assigned parts of 52 and 62. Route 52 began at Newport News and followed the Midland Trail to Richmond, but took a more southerly route to Lexington, Virginia. The trail was used again through West Virginia to Huntington, where Route 52 split to the northwest. Route 62 began at Ashland, Kentucky (near Huntington) and followed the Midland Trail across northeastern Kentucky to Louisville, where the trail crossed the Ohio River and became Route 150. Route 62 continued southwest along the south bank of the Ohio River to Wickliffe in western Kentucky, and then crossed the Mississippi River at the Ohio&#x27;s mouth. The final portion of Route 62 crossed southern Missouri to Springfield on an existing main highway that had been numbered 16 by the state.

Kentucky Governor William J. Fields objected to the Joint Board&#x27;s plan, which took most major east–west routes (multiples of ten) to the East Coast, but sent Route 60 from Los Angeles northeast to end in Chicago, leaving none to cross Kentucky, the only Mississippi Valley state without such a route. Proposals were considered for splitting US 60 into 60N and 60E at Springfield (MO) or using 62 for the Chicago route; Missouri had already prepared maps that showed the original plans for 60 and 62. The final plan, agreed to by the affected states, assigned US 66 to the Los Angeles-Chicago highway and US 60 to the route from Springfield to Virginia Beach (extended from Newport News), absorbing all of 62 and part of 52 from the 1925 plan.

Although US 60 initially stretched less than halfway across the country, due to its late creation, it was soon extended west to Los Angeles. One auto trail — the Atlantic and Pacific Highway - and three other U.S. Highways played a part in this extension. The Atlantic and Pacific Highway had been organized in 1921, and connected New York City with Los Angeles. The original alignment of U.S. Route 70 entered Clovis, New Mexico from the east, as it does now, but continued west to Holbrook, Arizona. Crossing US 70 at Clovis was the El Paso-Amarillo U.S. Route 366. Finally, U.S. Route 164 was created by 1928, stretching northeast and east from Amarillo to U.S. Route 64 and U.S. Route 81 in Enid, Oklahoma. The American Association of State Highway Officials approved the first part of the extension in May 1930, following the rest of Missouri&#x27;s Route 16 to the Oklahoma state line, and several state highways to Enid, before absorbing US 164 to a terminus at Amarillo. The remainder to Los Angeles was approved at AASHO&#x27;s June 1931 meeting, and involved a number of other changes. US 60 replaced US 366 from Amarillo to Clovis, where it continued west along US 70 to Springerville, Arizona. The remainder of US 70 to Holbrook, Arizona became a new U.S. Route 260, while US 60 followed the Atlantic and Pacific Highway, which it had picked up at Vaughn, New Mexico, southwest and west through Phoenix to Los Angeles. US 70 was not truncated to Clovis, but was instead redirected southwest along US 366 to El Paso, and later reached Los Angeles itself, though most of the route west of Globe, Arizona overlapped US 60.

After the Interstate Highway System was signed into law in 1956, the Midland Trail portion of US 60, from Louisville east to the Hampton Roads area, was bypassed by Interstate 64. From Phoenix west to Los Angeles, Interstate 10 paralleled and, for the most part, replaced US 60. I-10 and I-64 were mostly completed by the late 1970s, though part of Interstate 64 in West Virginia, built on a new alignment east from Beckley, did not bypass the old winding US 60 until July 15, 1988. California decommissioned its portion of US 60 in 1972; most was replaced by I-10, while the independent piece in the Los Angeles area became State Route 60. In 1982, the portion overlapping I-10 in western Arizona was removed. US 60 between Phoenix and Louisville remains a major regional corridor in most places, and is not paralleled by an Interstate for any significant length.

<text>Bell Mobility Inc. is a Canadian wireless network operator and the division of Bell Canada which offers wireless services across Canada. It operates networks using LTE and HSPA+ on its mainstream networks. Bell Mobility is the third-largest wireless carrier in Canada, with 10.1 million subscribers as of Q3 2020.

Bell-owned Virgin Mobile Canada as well as Loblaws prepaid PC Telecom, operate as MVNOs on the Bell Mobility network. Some of Bell Canada&#x27;s regional subsidiaries continue to operate their own wireless networks separate from (but generally allowing for roaming with) Bell Mobility; these are Northwestel (NMI Mobility and Latitude Wireless), Télébec (Télébec Mobilité), and NorthernTel (NorthernTel Mobility).

In July 2006, Bell Mobility assumed responsibility for the former Aliant wireless operations in Atlantic Canada as part of a larger restructuring of both Bell and Aliant, and continued to do business there as Aliant Mobility until re-branding as Bell in April 2008. Bell similarly acquired MTS in Manitoba in 2017, rebranding it as Bell MTS; initially operating autonomously as Bell MTS Mobility, its wireless customers were brought under Bell Mobility in late-2018.

== Networks ==
Although both are different and independent from one another, both the CDMA and UMTS networks use the 850 and 1900 MHz frequencies. Bell&#x27;s LTE network uses Band 4 Advanced Wireless Services (AWS 1700/2100 MHz) and Band 2 Personal Communications Service (PCS 1900 MHz) in most coverage areas and Band 7 (2600 MHz) in a few areas.

As of April 30, 2019, all CDMA service from Bell has been discontinued.

=== UMTS ===

In October 2009, Telus Mobility and Bell announced plans to deploy HSPA technology by 2010 as part of an effort to eventually upgrade to LTE technology. The network, using largely shared infrastructure, launched on November 4, 2009.

According to Bell, the single-channel HSPA+ network is available to 96% of the Canadian population. It provides download speeds of up to 21 Mbit/s, with typical speeds ranging between 3½ and 8 Mbit/s. The dual-channel network, on the other hand, began in 2010 and is available to 70% of the Canadian population. It can reach download speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s but with typical speeds of 7 to 14 Mbit/s.

Bell&#x27;s HSPA+ network coverage is in portions of all Canadian provinces and territories, but it is not possible to drive in Canada between the Pacific coast to the Atlantic coast without going through areas without any cellular coverage, as there are gaps in cellular coverage in British Columbia and Ontario.

===LTE===

Bell launched LTE by using the 1700 MHz (Band 4) frequency in Toronto and surrounding areas on September 14, 2011. Since then, Bell has expanded LTE into most areas of Canada where it has HSPA coverage, and launched LTE on to the 2600 MHz (Band 7) frequency for additional bandwidth in March 2012 and on to the 700 MHz spectrum (paired bands LTE Band 12/17 and 13 and unpaired Band 29) in 2014. Bell will use either Band 13 or Band 12 depending on provinces.

As of May 2017, LTE coverage reaches 97% of Canada&#x27;s population, but there are gaps in coverage in smaller communities and between communities, where Bell&#x27;s HSPA+ network is available but its LTE network is not available.

As of February 2016, Bell Mobility has launched voice over LTE (VoLTE).

=== 5G NR ===
In June 2020, Bell launched 5G services in Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver using 1700 MHz AWS-3 spectrum (band n66). Bell has used equipment from Ericsson and Nokia Networks.

===Radio frequency summary===


== Products ==

Feature phones and smartphones supporting HSPA and LTE are offered by Bell, and are generally the same as offered by the other two large carriers in Canada, Rogers Wireless and Telus Mobility.

=== Legacy products ===

Due to the age of the technology as deployed by Bell, CDMA smartphones are no longer supported by Bell Mobility.

==Services==

===History===
The first cell phone conversation in Canada took place on the Bell network between Jean Drapeau and Art Eggleton, the mayors of Montreal and Toronto, on July 1, 1985.

The first cell phone customer in Canada was Victor Surerus, a travelling funeral director out of Peterborough, Ontario who purchased a $2,700 CAD telephone set and took out a service subscription with Bell Canada in July 1985.

Bell Mobility discontinued its Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) analog mobile network in February 2008.

===Current services===
* BlackBerry Internet Service
* Telephony
* SMS and MMS

Bell offers a service to check account balances, minutes and megabytes of mobile data used, add features and answers to frequently asked questions. The service is called TCARE, short for text message care. It is used by sending a blank message to the phone number TCARE (82273).

===Mobile Internet===
Bell offers four Internet-only plans and several smartphone plans and add-ons for customers wishing to access mobile broadband.

Various fixed data allowances are offered by Bell: 10, 20, 100, 300 and 500 MB, as well as 1 to 6 GB, 10 GB and 15 GB. The 20 MB add-on is a daily allowance, while the others are monthly allowances.

Flexible data plans are also available. This is used for Bell Mobility&#x27;s Internet-only plans and some smartphone plans, which begins with a certain usage limit at a lower tier. if this is exceeded, the customer moves to the next higher tier with a slightly larger allowance.

The flexible &quot;Turbo Hub flex plan&quot; from Bell differs in that customers have to pay a premium if they want to increase the maximum theoretical speeds from 7.2 Mbit/s to 21 Mbit/s. No additional usage is included when paying for the speed upgrade. Bell&#x27;s policy is to only allow the sale of Turbo Hub service with its own Turbo Hub devices.


* Bell&#x27;s wireless Internet plan starts at the initial 2 GB tier. If this is exceeded, the tier automatically goes up to 5 GB, then up to 10 GB, then up to 15 GB as the final tier. There are additional charges if one does goes above the 15 GB tier.

Some grandfathered customers have an unlimited mobile Internet plan or add-on. These are usually limited to older and slower CDMA devices such as the now-discontinued Palm Pre, and normally cannot be used for tethering unless the device is a mobile broadband modem. Its active Virgin Mobile Canada brand also have grandfathered accounts with unlimited mobile broadband.

=== Mobile TV and Radio===

Bell Mobile TV was launched for Bell smartphones on October 18, 2010.

=== Push-To-Talk ===
On April 24, 2012, Bell launched an improved Push-To-Talk (PTT) service. It is powered by Bell&#x27;s newer HSPA+ network, in contrast to the operator&#x27;s older PTT (Officially titled 10-4) service which used the CDMA network. HSPA+ service is available at one flat rate for unlimited Bell-to-Bell PTT service from and to Canada. The monthly service can either be purchased alone, or added to any plan at a lower cost. PTT roaming in the United States or other countries is billed per megabyte. One megabyte offers approximately ten minutes of PTT talk time. Consequently, Bell offers approximately 100 to 400 PTT roaming minutes for traveling in the USA.

=== Discontinued services ===
Bell launched a proprietary Video Calling service on November 4, 2009 for select HSPA+ mobile phones. The service featured a cost of $5 CAD per month for unlimited video calls. It was supported by the LG Xenon, Nokia C6, Nokia N97, Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant, Samsung Omnia II and Samsung Wave smartphones. These devices have all been discontinued. It is unknown whether or not a non-Bell Galaxy S, or even Bell&#x27;s Samsung Galaxy S II, support the Video Calling service. These Android-based devices, however, can use the included Google Talk for videoconferencing as long as they have an Internet connection available.

==Advertising==

In conjunction with the 2006 Olympics, Bell Mobility introduced a pair of anthropomorphic CGI beavers named Frank (voiced by Norm Macdonald) and Gordon (voiced by Ken Hudson Campbell), who constantly got into misadventures which led to Frank getting flustered with the antics of the dimwitted Gordon. Analysts covering a potential restructuring of BCE suggested getting rid of the &quot;Frank and Gordon&quot; ad campaign. They have also criticized some of Bell Mobility&#x27;s initiatives as failing to tap the market, such as offering full-length movies.

The ad campaign was canceled by Bell on August 1, 2008 and replaced with the &quot;Today just got better&quot; campaign.

==Criticism==

===Feature restrictions===

Some clients of Bell Mobility have claimed that their phones&#x27; features have been restricted. This action is typically referred to as &quot;crippling&quot;. Examples of claims of restricted features are the inability to perform Bluetooth file transfers, for example with the OBEX profile or with a USB cable. Restrictions also include increasing the GPS lock time (2–10 minutes) and resolution (1-2.5 km) of third-party applications while maintaining the speed (10-15 s) and accuracy (10–25 m) of the branded GPS Nav program. GPS Nav service costs $10/month or $3.50/day in addition to the cost of a data plan. The phones affected include the BlackBerry 8830 World Edition, BlackBerry 8130 Pearl, and BlackBerry 8330 Curve.

Some clients claim that Bell Mobility purposely restricts these features in order to force them to use the data services and as a result pay more usage charges. Methods around these restrictions are to use an external memory card or software such as BitPim. Researching the abilities and lack thereof is recommended before purchasing a phone or PDA device, as some desired features may be lacking in the initial choice.

Some clients claim that Bell Mobility withholds firmware upgrades, especially for devices that are not meeting sales expectations. While some SKUs do receive updates on a regular basis, Bell Mobility is reluctant to release upgrades that add enhancements to product, focusing only on firmware releases that fix issues. Oftentimes those upgrades fail to become available as well.

===Data Plans===

In December 2007 the BBC reported a customer with a $7/month unlimited mobile browser plan received a $85,000 bill. The customer had used his phone as a wireless modem for his computer, and so data transferred was not included under the customer&#x27;s unlimited mobile browser plan. Bell Mobility now releases in detail acceptable data usage in the terms of service. The BBC reported &quot;Canadians complain that their mobile phone charges are much higher for comparable service in the United States&quot;.

===Text Messaging===
In July 2008, along with Telus Mobility Bell introduced charges of 15¢ for incoming SMS messages. Critics were quick to point out that there is no way of blocking incoming message fees and suggested Bell and Telus were price fixing as both had announced the fees simultaneously. Bell (and Telus) are now being sued by frustrated consumers and subscribers, as they demand change in text charges. Many customers were frustrated because this fee also apply to existing customers with ongoing contracts.

==Retail presence==
In addition to running its own retail operations, Bell co-owns Glentel alongside their chief telecom and media rival, Rogers. Bell Mobility also distributes through the independent Cellcom Communications, mainly in the Greater Montreal area. Bell purchased ownership in The Source (formerly known as RadioShack) to increase its retail presence.

<text>Bell Media Inc. (French: ) is a Canadian media conglomerate that is the mass media subsidiary of BCE Inc. (also known as Bell Canada Enterprises, the owner of telecommunications company Bell Canada). Its operations include national television broadcasting and production (including the CTV and CTV 2 television networks), radio broadcasting (through iHeartRadio Canada), digital media (including Crave) and Internet properties (including the now-defunct Sympatico portal).

Bell Media is the successor-in-interest to Baton Broadcasting (later CTV Inc.), one of Canada&#x27;s first private-sector television broadcasters. Although the company was founded in 1960 as Telegram Corporation, the current enterprise traces its origins to the establishment of Bell Globemedia Inc. in 2001 by BCE and the Thomson family, combining CTV Inc. (which BCE had acquired in 2000) and the operations of the Thomson family&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. BCE sold the majority of its interest in 2006 (after which the company was renamed CTVglobemedia Inc. in 2007), but in 2011, BCE acquired the entire company (excluding &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;) and changed the name to Bell Media Inc.

== Origins ==
=== Baton Broadcasting ===

For all practical purposes, Bell Media is the successor to Baton Broadcasting Incorporated ( ), which by the late 1990s had become one of Canada&#x27;s largest broadcasters.

Formed in 1960 as Baton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting Ltd., the company was originally created to establish Toronto&#x27;s first private television station, CFTO-TV. The name of this company derived from its initial investors, including the Bassett and Eaton families (Baton), and Aldred-Rogers Broadcasting (owned by broadcaster Joel Aldred and Ted Rogers); Foster Hewitt was also an initial investor, but in a much smaller role. Aldred sold his shares in 1961, followed by Rogers by 1970, thereby relieving their names from the company title. With the Bassett and Eaton families firmly in control, the company went public in the early 1970s.

CFTO was one of the charter affiliates of CTV when that network formed in 1961, becoming the network&#x27;s flagship. In 1966, Baton became a part-owner in the network when it was reorganized as a station-owned cooperative. The Board of Broadcast Governors was initially skeptical about the proposal to turn CTV into a cooperative. Since CFTO was by far the largest and richest station in the network, the BBG feared Baton would take advantage of this to dominate the network. However, it approved the deal after Baton and the other owners included a provision in the cooperative&#x27;s bylaws stipulating that the eight station owners would each have a single vote regardless of audience share. Additionally, if one owner ever bought another station, the acquired station&#x27;s shares would be redistributed among the remaining owners so that each owner would still have one vote out of eight.

In 1972, Baton began purchasing other CTV affiliates, starting with CFQC-TV in Saskatoon. This did not, however, give Baton a substantially higher investment in CTV, since its shares were redistributed among the other owners. As a result, Baton still had only one vote out of eight.

In 1987, Baton began a concerted effort to take over CTV. It started this drive with a further expansion into Saskatchewan, purchasing CKCK-TV in Regina, Yorkton twinstick CKOS-TV/CICC-TV, and CBC affiliate CKBI-TV Prince Albert. A twinstick CTV affiliate was soon launched in Prince Albert, CIPA-TV.

In the late 1980s, Baton applied for a high-power station in Ottawa on channel 60. The licence was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), appealed to federal cabinet by rival broadcasters, and ultimately sent back to the CRTC for review. However the license was surrendered when Baton was instead able to acquire the local CTV affiliate, CJOH-TV, from Allan Slaight&#x27;s Standard Broadcasting.

In 1990, Baton purchased the MCTV system of twinstick operations in Pembroke, North Bay, Sudbury, Timmins, and the Huron Broadcasting twinstick in Sault Ste. Marie. In 1993, Baton purchased CFPL-TV in London, CKNX-TV in Wingham and received a license for a new independent station, CHWI-TV, in Windsor.

In 1991, the company launched Ontario Network Television, a secondary affiliation carried by Baton&#x27;s CTV and independent stations in Ontario. This was expanded in 1994 into the Baton Broadcast System (BBS), which included Baton&#x27;s Saskatchewan stations. BBS was meant as a backup in case Baton&#x27;s ongoing acquisitions did not translate into control of CTV itself. A year earlier, CTV had been recently restructured into a corporation, with each owner holding a 14.3% stake in the network. However, any &quot;future&quot; acquisitions by Baton would come with all of that affiliate&#x27;s CTV shares. It was around this time that former CBC executive Ivan Fecan joined the company.

=== Baton-Electrohome alliance and CTV Inc. (1996–2000) ===
In 1996, the CRTC approved two major deals involving Baton. First was the acquisition of CFCN-TV in Calgary from Rogers Communications, which had recently purchased Maclean Hunter. Second, Baton and Electrohome—owner of CKCO-TV in Kitchener and CFRN-TV in Edmonton—formed an alliance, under which the companies would share ownership of CFCN; Baton&#x27;s stations in Saskatchewan and its independent stations in southwestern Ontario; and Electrohome&#x27;s CKCO. The deals doubled Baton&#x27;s own interest in CTV to 28.6%. However, as part of the deal, Baton took control of Electrohome&#x27;s CTV vote, allowing it to command 42.9% of CTV&#x27;s shares.

In January 1997, Baton-Electrohome&#x27;s &quot;Vancouver Television&quot; proposal emerged as the CRTC&#x27;s choice for the new independent station in Vancouver, beating out four other competitors. The new station, CIVT-TV, would compete directly with Western International Communications&#x27;s two CTV affiliates in the market when it was launched that fall.

On February 25, 1997, the Baton-Electrohome alliance and CHUM Limited announced that several stations would be swapped between them. Baton-Electrohome would acquire CHUM&#x27;s Atlantic Television System (ATV), consisting of four CTV affiliates in the Maritimes, the Atlantic Satellite Network (ASN), and a further 14.3% in CTV. CHUM would receive Baton&#x27;s independent stations in southwestern Ontario, as well as CHRO-TV in Pembroke, which had recently disaffiliated from CTV. The Baton-Electrohome alliance now held 57.2% of CTV.

Shortly thereafter, Electrohome announced it would sell its broadcasting assets—including CFRN, its interest in the alliance, and its CTV shares—to Baton in exchange for cash and shares in Baton. These two deals were approved by the CRTC in August. Baton now held controlling interest in CTV, triggering a put option that allowed the other owners to sell their stakes in the network while still keeping their stations. Accordingly, Baton acquired the remaining CTV shares from WIC and Moffat Communications (Newfoundland Broadcasting, owner of CJON-TV, had effectively relinquished its vote when CTV became a corporation) that fall.

The BBS television system was merged into CTV, with the company itself being renamed CTV Inc. the following year. The Eatons&#x27; remaining shares, representing 41% of Baton (estimated at CA$450 million), were sold off to the general public in early 1998. By the end of 2001, nearly all CTV stations were consolidated under network ownership (including one replacement).

In 1999, CTV Inc. acquired NetStar Communications, a company that was spun out from the broadcasting division of the Labatt Brewing Company after its acquisition by Interbrew in 1995. The sale was approved by the CRTC March 24, 2000, but CTV had to divest either Netstar&#x27;s TSN or their own Sportsnet; they chose to sell the latter to Rogers.

=== Bell Globemedia (2000–06) ===
At the beginning of the 2000s, Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE) acquired CTV Inc. (including the NetStar assets) and bought &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, folding the two into a new media venture, Bell Globemedia Inc (BGM).

This venture was masterminded by former Bell Canada chief executive Jean Monty, largely as a response to Canwest&#x27;s purchase of the Southam newspaper chain as well as the trend of media convergence, particularly the AOL-Time Warner merger. Monty believed that to survive in a changing technological landscape, and in particular to drive subscriptions to satellite television provider Bell ExpressVu and internet service provider Bell Sympatico, BCE had to have control over content.

The transaction was structured as follows. In 2000, BCE acquired CTV Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at CA$2.3 billion. Soon after, Monty arranged to have Thomson Corporation transfer control of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, the Toronto-based national newspaper, to BCE in exchange for a significant interest (20%) in the merged CTV/&quot;Globe&quot; entity. The Thomson family&#x27;s holding company (The Woodbridge Company Limited) invested in the company directly to obtain an additional 9.9% interest, and it later bought Thomson Corporation&#x27;s interest.

The resulting company (Bell Globemedia) consisted of CTV, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, and the Internet portal then known as Sympatico-Lycos (Lycos was later replaced by MSN). Fecan was named the combined firm&#x27;s president and CEO (a role he remained in for the duration of the BGM/CTVglobemedia era). After Monty resigned and was replaced by Michael Sabia in 2002, it became clear that Monty&#x27;s vision was not producing anything near the desired results, notwithstanding the good results for the individual units, particularly the CTV network.

The following years provided a few cosmetic changes in BGM&#x27;s assets. In 2001, CTV acquired CKY-TV in Winnipeg and CFCF-TV in Montreal, and moved the CTV affiliation in British Columbia to CIVT, replacing two affiliates that had been purchased by Canwest. That fall also brought the launch of the first digital specialty channels, including several owned by CTV.

The company acquired partial ownership in TQS in 2002, the Sympatico portal was sold back to Bell Canada, while a further investment from the Thomsons (whose ownership increased to 31.5%) funded the acquisition of 15% of Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment. However, beginning in 2003, BCE management began to refer to BGM as a non-core asset; as a result, much attention was given to the likely sale of the company, and potentially a breakup into several different pieces.

On December 2, 2005, Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE) announced that it would sell an 8.5% interest to The Woodbridge Company Limited (increasing their total ownership to 40%), a 20% interest to Torstar, and a 20% interest to the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan. BCE retained 20% of the group—a condition that ensured that Bell Satellite TV, Sympatico, and other Bell units continued to have access to Bell Globemedia (BGM) content. The transaction closed on August 30, 2006.

This deal put to rest any rumors about a possible breakup of the company. However, Torstar&#x27;s involvement led to additional media concentration concerns, mainly from media unions. Torstar insisted it was committed to maintaining the editorial independence of the &quot;Globe&quot; and its own &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, and ultimately there were no major regulatory hurdles due to this.

On July 12, 2006, BGM announced a friendly bid to take over CHUM Limited for an estimated $1.7 billion. The acquisition would bring the secondary broadcast system (Citytv), other stations including CablePulse24, MuchMusic, Star!, Bravo!, and Space, and all of CHUM&#x27;s radio stations, into the BGM fold. BGM originally announced that CHUM&#x27;s A-Channel stations, Access, CKX-TV, MusiquePlus, MusiMax, Canadian Learning Television, SexTV: The Channel and BGM&#x27;s own OLN would not be retained.

On September 7, 2006, in order to pay for the CHUM acquisition, BGM sold additional shares to its existing shareholders. BCE did not participate in the refinancing; the net effect was an increase in Teachers&#x27; ownership to 25%, while BCE&#x27;s interest was reduced to 15%.

=== CTVglobemedia (2007–11) ===

As a result of BCE&#x27;s reduced ownership in the company, Bell Globemedia was renamed CTVglobemedia Inc. on January 1, 2007.

In April of that year, Rogers Communications announced a tentative deal to purchase A-Channel, CKX-TV, Access Alberta, Canadian Learning Television, and Cooking Channel from CTVglobemedia, if its purchase of CHUM was approved. Astral Media made a similar deal for CHUM&#x27;s 50% interest in MusiMax and MusiquePlus.

That June, the CRTC approved the CHUM takeover, on condition that CTV sell off the Citytv stations, because of the CTV network&#x27;s owned-and-operated station stations serving the very same cities. CTV ultimately chose to keep the A-Channel stations along with the rest of CHUM Ltd. assets it had previously said it would sell, except for MusiquePlus/MusiMax. Rogers Communications was announced as the buyer of the Citytv stations on June 11, 2007, and the CHUM acquisition was finalized on June 22.

Subsequently, CTVglobemedia, Inc. sold off its interests in various non-core channels. Rogers purchased several of these assets, including CTV&#x27;s 33% interest in OLN in late 2007, as well as radio stations CHST-FM in London, Ontario and CHBN-FM in Edmonton, Alberta in 2010. Corus Entertainment would acquire Canadian Learning Television, Cooking Channel, and Drive-In Classics for a combined $113 million. TQS entered bankruptcy protection and was ultimately acquired by Remstar (which renamed the network &quot;V&quot;). Meanwhile, Glassbox Television acquired Travel + Escape in late 2010. In two cases, the operations were closed down, specifically CBC affiliate CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba (which left the air in October 2009 after a deal to sell that station to Bluepoint Investment Corporation fell through) and the A station in Wingham, CKNX-TV (which left the air one month prior to CKX and is now a rebroadcaster of the A station in London, CFPL-TV).

CTVglobemedia acquired Toronto station CFXJ-FM from Milestone Radio in 2010.

On September 10, 2010, BCE announced plans to re-acquire 100% of the company&#x27;s broadcasting arm, including CTV Inc. Under the deal, Woodbridge, Torstar, and Teachers&#x27; would together receive $1.3 billion in either cash or equity in BCE, while BCE would also assume $1.7 billion in debt (BCE&#x27;s existing equity interest was $200 million, for a total transaction value of $3.2 billion). Woodbridge would also regain majority control of The Globe and Mail Inc., with BCE retaining a 15% interest. The overall deal was expected to close by April 2011. However, the sale of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Globe&quot;, which did not require CRTC approval, was completed in late December 2010. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 7, 2011, and the company was officially closed on April 1, 2011. It was renamed as Bell Media Inc.

== Post-2011 developments ==
=== Expansion (2011–13) ===
On December 9, 2011, the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan announced the sale of its majority stake in Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment to BCE and its rival, Rogers Communications, in a deal valued at around $1.32 billion. Additionally, Larry Tanenbaum increased his stake in the company to 25%. The deal closed in August 2012.

On March 16, 2012, BCE announced that it had entered in an agreement to acquire Montreal-based broadcaster Astral Media for an estimated value of $3.38 billion; the assets of which were to be incorporated into Bell Media. The acquisition was primarily centered on Astral&#x27;s premium services (such as The Movie Network and its stake in HBO Canada) and its French-language radio and television stations. Bell planned to use Astral&#x27;s premium offerings to enhance its own multi-platform services to compete against the likes of services such as Netflix, and its French media outlets to better compete against the dominant Québecor Média. The merger was notably opposed by a coalition of competing cable providers (which included Cogeco, EastLink, and Vidéotronthe last of which is also owned by Québecor Média, who felt that Bell&#x27;s control of a majority of Canadian media would harm consumer choice, and lead to increased carriage fees which could cripple smaller cable companies.

BCE&#x27;s first proposal was denied by the CRTC in October 2012; the commission believed that the combined company would have had too much market power. Soon afterward, Bell and Astral began to negotiate a second proposal that would involve selling most of Astral&#x27;s English-language television channels in order to quell fears by the CRTC. On March 18, 2013, the Competition Bureau cleared the revised proposal. Unlike the previous deal, which would have given Bell a 42% share of the English-language television market, the new deal would only give Bell a total market share of 35.7%, but still increase its French-language market share to 23% (in comparison to 8% before). Following hearings by the CRTC in May 2013, the CRTC approved Bell&#x27;s acquisition of Astral Media on June 27, 2013. The deal is subject to conditions, including the requirement to provide fair treatment to its competitors, to not impose &quot;restrictive bundling practices&quot; on Astral&#x27;s premium movie channels, invest $246.9 million over the next seven years on Canadian-produced programming, and to maintain the operation and local programming levels of all of its television stations through 2017. The CRTC also approved Bell&#x27;s proposed exemptions for maintaining ownership of Montreal&#x27;s CKGM. Bell put Family, Disney XD, the two Disney Junior services, MusiMax, MusiquePlus, and five radio stations up for sale, while Corus Entertainment acquired Historia, Séries+, and Teletoon from Astral and competitor Shaw Media.

On June 6, 2013, Bell announced that Bravo would be its first network to implement a TV Everywhere service, which would allow subscribers to Bravo on participating television service providers to stream video on demand content and the Bravo channel live via the Bravo Go app. Apps for some of its other networks were also released over the following months.

=== Layoffs, new partnerships (2014–17) ===
In December 2014, Bell Media launched CraveTV, a subscription video on-demand service. Initially, the service was available only through television providers; Bell Media president Kevin Crull argued that Bell did not want the service to cannibalize its linear television business, because its content &quot;[would not] exist if you didn&#x27;t have the traditional TV system. So you really can&#x27;t sustainably have one without the other.&quot;

On April 9, 2015, Crull stepped down as president of Bell Media, and was replaced by Mary Ann Turcke, the subsidiary&#x27;s former head of media sales. The move came following allegations reported by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that, after the CRTC&#x27;s March 2015 decision to mandate that pay television providers offer a la carte packages, Crull ordered all Bell-owned news properties, including CTV News, not to air any remarks by CRTC chairman Jean-Pierre Blais during reports regarding the decision. Although the CTV News Channel program &quot;Power Play&quot; and a report aired on the local evening newscasts complied with Crull&#x27;s order, the &quot;CTV National News&quot; that night defied Crull&#x27;s demand by airing a story on the changes that included remarks by Blais. CTV News president Wendy Freeman, Ottawa bureau chief Robert Fife, and the program&#x27;s anchor Lisa LaFlamme felt that the inclusion of remarks by Blais was necessary due to the nature of the story. In response to the dismissal, BCE CEO George A. Cope explained that the journalistic independence of its news operations was &quot;paramount importance to our company and to all Canadians&quot;.

Shortly after taking the position, Turcke was criticized for remarks that considered the use of virtual private network services to evade geo-blocking and access the U.S. version of subscription video on demand service Netflix to be &quot;stealing&quot;.

In late August 2015, Bell Media began a series of layoffs, which included directors and vice presidents. On November 6, 2015, additional layoffs of 380 jobs from production, editorial, sales, and administrative roles in Toronto and Montreal were revealed. On November 17, 2015, further cuts were made, which included high-profile on-air talent from radio and television properties in Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver.

On November 20, 2015, Corus announced that it would wind down the operation of Movie Central, a premium television service that had been granted exclusivity in Western Canada, and cede its regional monopoly to Bell Media&#x27;s The Movie Network, which was similarly restricted to Eastern Canada, allowing it to become available nationwide in 2016. Bell Media subsequently announced that it had acquired exclusive Canadian rights to all current HBO programming in Canada (rights previously shared with Corus due to its joint venture HBO Canada).

On January 6, 2016, iHeartMedia announced that it had partnered with Bell Media to launch a localized version of its online radio service iHeartRadio Canada. On January 14, 2016, CraveTV became available as a standalone service without requiring an existing television subscription.

On May 4, 2016, Bell acquired rights to the programming and branding of Canadian specialty channel Gusto TV. The channel was shut down, and re-launched on September 1, 2016, replacing M3 under its existing Category A license.

On January 31, 2017, Bell Media announced that it planned to perform another round of layoffs in 24 locations, citing various developments across Canada&#x27;s broadcasting industry, as well as the impact of recent regulatory decisions (such as one that prevents the federal simsub rules from being used on the Super Bowl, whose Canadian broadcast rights are currently owned by Bell Media).

=== Randy Lennox presidency (2017–20) ===
On February 27, 2017, Turcke left Bell to join the National Football League as president of NFL Media. She was succeeded as president by Randy Lennox. That month, Bell also announced that it had partnered with record executive Scott Borchetta to develop a new, international television format that would &quot;uncover, develop, and promote pop culture&#x27;s next musical superstars&quot;, and &quot;leverage Bell Media&#x27;s massive reach and extensive platforms to showcase musicians on the national and international stage.&quot; CTV officially announced the new series, &quot;The Launch&quot;, in April 2017.

On June 7, 2017, Wow Unlimited Media announced that it would acquire a specialty channel from the company (later revealed to be Comedy Gold; however, the sale would later be aborted, leading to the channel&#x27;s shutdown in 2019) to form a new network targeting children and young adults, and provide children&#x27;s television content for Bell&#x27;s over-the-top ventures. As part of the purchase, BCE will take 3.4 million common voting shares in the company.

On August 9, 2017, Bell announced that it would acquire Larche Communications&#x27; four Ontario radio stations, pending CRTC approval.

On October 17, 2017, Bell Media announced its intent to acquire Historia and Séries+—two French-language networks whose Astral-owned stakes were divested during its acquisition by Bell—from Corus Entertainment for $200 million. On May 28, 2018, both transactions were blocked by the Competition Bureau, citing a condition on the Bell/Astral deal which forbade Bell from re-acquiring properties divested in the sale for 10 years after its completion.

On January 23, 2018, Bell Media announced that it had reached licensing agreements with Starz Inc. and Lionsgate, and that TMN Encore would be rebranded under the Starz brand in 2019, featuring its programming. The following month, Bell launched SnackableTV, a streaming video app with short-form content from Bell Media properties and other sources.

In April 2018, Bell Media acquired a controlling stake in the Pinewood Toronto Studios complex. In May 2018, Bell Media announced that it, along with several other parties, would contribute French-language content to Radio-Canada&#x27;s subscription streaming service Ici Tou.tv Extra.

In May 2018, Bell Media laid off 17 employees, resulting in the cancellation of Discovery&#x27;s &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and Space&#x27;s &quot;Innerspace&quot;.

On June 7, 2018, during the CTV upfronts, it was announced that four Bell Media specialty channels would re-brand in September 2019, with Bravo, Comedy Network, Gusto, and Space respectively becoming CTV Drama Channel, CTV Comedy Channel, CTV Life Channel, and CTV Sci-Fi Channel. Two new ad-supported video-on-demand platforms were also announced: CTV Movies and CTV Vault (renamed CTV Throwback on launch). These rebrandings and launches will be incorporated into a larger, unified digital platform containing content from all six services. Later that day, it was also announced that Bell Media was one of two Canadian companies that had acquired a stake in the Montreal-based comedy festival Just for Laughs.

On August 16, 2018, Vice Media announced a long-term output deal with Bell Media, which would see its networks and properties hold rights to Viceland programming in Canada.

On July 24, 2019, Bell announced its intent to acquire the French-language broadcast television network V from V Media Group pending CRTC approval, as well as its streaming outlet Noovo. CTVglobemedia previously owned a 40% stake in the network prior to its sale to Remstar. On April 3, 2020, the sale was approved; as a condition of the purchase, the CRTC stated that all five V stations must air five hours of local programming per-week through the 2020-2021 broadcast year, and expanding to eight-and-a-half hours per-week in Montreal and Quebec City by 2021–2022. At least half of all local programming must be locally-reflective. The sale was closed on May 15, 2020. V would later be renamed to Noovo on August 31, 2020.
=== Wade Oosterman era (2021–2023) ===
On October 19, 2020, BCE announced that Lennox would be leaving the organization on January 4, 2021, and that Bell group president Wade Oosterman, to whom Lennox had reported, would take over operational leadership of Bell Media directly, while maintaining oversight of Bell&#x27;s wireless, residential, and small-business telecom operations. BCE subsequently clarified that Oosterman had taken the title of president of Bell Media while remaining vice-chair of BCE and Bell Canada.

Immediately following Lennox&#x27;s departure, Oosterman announced a new, simplified executive structure. As a result, several senior executives of Bell Media, some having served with the company&#x27;s predecessors since the late 1990s, left the company; two of the three senior vice presidents reporting to Oosterman under the new structure also have roles overseeing parts of Bell&#x27;s telecom business. Several other lower-level managers were laid off about two weeks later. This in turn was followed in early February by the elimination of hundreds of rank-and-file positions, including at least 210 in the company&#x27;s Toronto offices alone, the removal of dedicated newsrooms for news-talk radio stations CJAD Montreal and CFRB Toronto, and the reformatting of three TSN Radio outlets as automated business news or comedy stations with little locally produced content.

In a memo announcing the end of the restructuring, Oosterman described the moves as necessary to &quot;reflect the reality of sweeping change facing [Bell Media]&quot; including impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, changing media consumption patterns and &quot;aggressive&quot; competition from global players. They were also widely seen as indicating a corporate shift in focus away from traditional media outlets and towards Bell&#x27;s streaming services like Crave and iHeartRadio. However, observers including Unifor, the main labour union representing Bell employees, questioned the need for the layoffs, given that parent company BCE had accepted $122 million in assistance through the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy in 2020, while being able to increase its dividend payments to shareholders.

In June 2023, BCE announced that it was cutting 1,300 positions across its telecom and media operations (around three per cent of its workforce, and of which approximately 30% were unfilled vacancies), including six per cent of positions at Bell Media (which had 5,645 employees at the end of 2022). The company also announced it would be closing or selling nine AM radio stations, some of which had changed to automated formats during previous rounds of cuts: CFRW, CKMX, CFRN, CKST, CFTE, and CJBK all closed immediately, while CKWW, CKOC, and CHAM were slated for sale to one or more third-party buyers to be named later.

BCE blamed a number of industry changes and increasing losses in its news divisions for the cuts, while questioning the regulatory priorities of the federal government and the CRTC; one BCE executive mentioned having waited for reforms on some items for years, while also citing &quot;relentless regulatory intervention&quot; by the CRTC to cut wireless and Internet service pricing. This rationale was questioned by union officials and other experts who felt Bell should have better prepared for industry changes, or could have waited for the full implementation of the &quot;Online Streaming Act&quot; (Bill C-11) and the &quot;Online News Act&quot; (Bill C-18).

In June 2023, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that after the controversial dismissal of long-time &quot;CTV National News&quot; anchor Lisa LaFlamme in 2022, Oosterman was recorded urging news managers from its CTV, BNN, CP24 properties to get their journalists to &quot;help&quot; by providing favourable coverage when reporting on Bell as long as it did not &quot;distort reality&quot;. Oosterman also criticized CTV for not forcing conflict between opposing viewpoints to get more viewers. Oosterman&#x27;s remarks seemingly violated the company&#x27;s 2015 journalistic independence policy.

On August 16, 2023, Vrak and Z were removed from Vidéotron. As a consequence, Vrak closed down on October 1, 2023. 

=== Sean Cohan presidency (2023–present) ===
On October 3, 2023, BCE announced that Oosterman would be retiring from the conglomerate by early January 2024, and would be replaced as president of Bell Media by Sean Cohan, a former executive for the American media companies A&amp;E Networks and Nielsen. On October 23, 2023, Bell Media acquired Outfront Media&#x27;s Canadian business for $410 million.

On February 8, 2024, BCE announced that it would cut 4,800 positions (10% of which coming from Bell Media), citing declining revenues, and new CRTC requirements mandating that the company offer wholesale access to its fibreoptic telecom networks to competitors. Due to the restructuring, Bell Media announced that it would cut most noon and weekend newscasts across all CTV stations, cut programming at CTV News Channel and BNN Bloomberg, and sell 45 of its 103 radio stations to Arsenal Media, Durham Radio, Maritime Broadcasting System, My Broadcasting Corporation, Vista Radio, Golden Horseshoe Broadcasting Limited (a subsidiary of Whiteoaks Communications Group), and ZoomerMedia. Bell executive Robert Malcolmson told the Canadian Press that radio was &quot;not a viable business anymore&quot;.

MTV2 was closed on March 29, 2024. This left the main MTV network to be the last remaining licensed Paramount Global channel under Bell Media.

On June 10, 2024, Rogers Sports &amp; Media announced that it had acquired the rights to all of Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s factual and lifestyle brands starting in January 2025. This would mark the end of Bell Media and CTV&#x27;s long-running relationship with Discovery and its sibling networks. Bell filed a court injunction seeking to halt the agreement, arguing that their contract with WBD provides for a two-year non-compete clause (&quot;window to adjust&quot;) if the company does not renew its licensing agreements. Rogers claims the suit is without merit. 

On October 8, 2024, Bell settled with WBD and Rogers, and concurrently reached an agreement to renew its licensing agreement with the company for HBO and Warner Bros. entertainment content on Crave. Bell and WBD also entered into an agreement to co-produce new programming, and license Bell Media original productions for international distribution outside of Canada. On October 17, Bell announced planned rebrands and relaunches for its Discovery-branded networks taking effect January 1, 2025. Animal Planet, Discovery Science, and Discovery Velocity would be brought under Bell&#x27;s CTV-branded specialty networks as CTV Wild Channel, CTV Nature Channel, and CTV Speed Channel respectively. Meanwhile, Bell announced a new licensing agreement with NBCUniversal, which would see Discovery Channel and Investigation Discovery relaunched as Canadian versions of USA Network and Oxygen True Crime respectively.

On October 31, 2024, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that MTV Canada would wind down on December 31, 2024 due to “changing audiences”. The channel was created in 2000 as Talktv. Many MTV Canada&#x27;s programs have been relocated to Paramount+ (launched in Canada in 2018) while some have been moved to other Bell Media-owned channels such as CTV or Much, as well as the Crave streaming service.

== Operations ==

Bell Media&#x27;s largest division is CTV Inc., which owns the following broadcast television assets:

<text>An instar (, from the Latin &quot;&quot; &#x27;form, likeness&#x27;) is a developmental stage of arthropods, such as insects, which occurs between each moult (&quot;ecdysis&quot;) until sexual maturity is reached. Arthropods must shed the exoskeleton in order to grow or assume a new form. Differences between instars can often be seen in altered body proportions, colors, patterns, changes in the number of body segments or head width. After shedding their exoskeleton (moulting), the juvenile arthropods continue in their life cycle until they either pupate or moult again. The instar period of growth is fixed; however, in some insects, like the salvinia stem-borer moth, the number of instars depends on early larval nutrition. Some arthropods can continue to moult after sexual maturity, but the stages between these subsequent moults are generally not called instars.

For most insect species, an &quot;instar&quot; is the developmental stage of the larval forms of holometabolous (complete metamorphism) or nymphal forms of hemimetabolous (incomplete metamorphism) insects, but an instar can be any developmental stage including pupa or imago (the adult, which does not moult in insects).

The number of instars an insect undergoes often depends on the species and the environmental conditions, as described for a number of species of Lepidoptera. However, it is believed that the number of instars can be physiologically constant per species in some insect orders, as for example Diptera and Hymenoptera. The number of larval instars is not directly related to speed of development. For instance, environmental conditions may dramatically affect the developmental rates of species and still have no impact on the number of larval instars. As examples, lower temperatures and lower humidity often slow the rate of development and that may have an effect on how many molts an insect will undergo an example of this is seen in the lepidopteran tobacco budworm. On the other hand, temperature affects the development rates of a number of hymenopterans without affecting numbers of instars or larval morphology, as observed in the ensign wasp and in the red imported fire ant. The number of larval instars in ants has been the subject of a number of recent investigations, and no instance of temperature-related variation in numbers of instars has yet been recorded.

<text>Baia Sprie (; , ) is a town in Maramureș County, northern Romania. Baia Sprie is situated at a distance of from Baia Mare and belongs to the Baia Mare metropolitan area. 

The town administers three villages: Chiuzbaia (&quot;Kisbánya&quot;), Satu Nou de Sus (&quot;Felsőújfalu&quot;), and Tăuții de Sus (&quot;Giródtótfalu&quot;). Neighbouring communities are the city of Baia Mare and the communes Groși, Dumbrăvița, Șisești, and Desești.

The town was one of the most important mining centers in north-western Romania, exploitation of gold and silver being mentioned in documents written in the Middle Ages, during the time when the Saxons colonized the region. However, recent administrative changes and restructuring of the Romanian mining industry brought this activity to an almost complete halt.

==History==
The first written mention of the settlement dates back to 1329 as &quot;Civitas in medio monte&quot;, in 1406 as &quot;civitas &quot;Medii Montis&quot;&quot;, in 1390, 1452, 1455 as &quot;civitas &quot;Felsevbanya&quot;&quot;, and since 1523 as &quot;Felsőbánya&quot;. The old Romanian name of the town was &quot;Baia de Sus&quot;, which means &quot;Upper Mine&quot;, same as in Hungarian.

The town was in Szatmár County, in the Kingdom of Hungary. King Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, as part of treaty with Serbian ruler Despotus Stefan Lazarević, gave him Baia Sprie as a gift in 1411, until Lazarević&#x27; death in 1427. A year later, Lazarević&#x27;s successor, Despotus Đurađ Branković of Serbia, became lord of Baia Sprie. In 1567, Baia Sprie was annexed by János Zsigmond, Prince of Transylvania. In 1605–1606, 1621–1629, and 1645–1648, the town and the county were part of the Principality of Transylvania.

The 1850 census, conducted in German, recorded 5,427 inhabitants, representing 1,336 families living in 993 houses. As for the nationalities existing at that time, the Hungarians numbered 3,800, Romanians 1,093, Germans 333, Slovaks 140, and Roma 40. In the 1910 census, the following languages were spoken in the township: Hungarian language 93.8%, Romanian language 5.2%, and others 1.0%. At the same census, the following religions were represented: Roman Catholic 52.1%, Greek Catholic 28.1%, Calvinist 13.3%, Judaism 6.1%, and others 0.5%.

After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I and the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Romanian Army took control of the area in the spring of 1919, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The town officially became part of the Kingdom of Romania in June 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon which ceded the territory from Hungary. In August 1940, the Second Vienna Award, arbitrated by Germany and Italy, reassigned the territory of Northern Transylvania (which included Baia Sprie) from Romania to Hungary. Towards the end of World War II, however, the town was taken back from Hungarian and German troops by Romanian and Soviet forces in October 1944. The township belonged alternately to the Baia Mare Region (in 1950–1960), Maramureș Region (1960–1968) and, as of 1968, Maramureș County. In the early 1950s, a communist prison camp operated at the mine.

==Population==
At the 2021 census, Baia Sprie had a population of 14,329, of which 68.52% were Romanians, 11.67% Hungarians, and 2.09% Roma. At the 2011 census, the town had 14,971 inhabitants; of those, 77.9% were Romanians, 17.3% Hungarians, and 4.2% Roma. The main religious groups in 2002 were 11,344 Romanian Orthodox, 2,739 Roman Catholic, 886 Calvinist, and 636 Greek Catholic.

<text>This article deals with the disputed area on the borders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia, in Luapula Province.

==Origins in the 1894 treaty==

Zambia&#x27;s formal northern frontier boundary was legally signed in the Anglo-Belgian Treaty of 1894, long after the 1884 Berlin Conference. This showed that the triangle of land at the northwestern point of Eastern Rhodesia from Pweto to as far south as the Lunchinda River was under Northern Rhodesia even though the Belgian Congo had administered it for many years. Belgians administered it as a matter of local convenience under a gentleman’s agreement. Much of this administration was facilitated by the Belgium missionary work in education and health, particularly the Roman Catholic Church and Greek fishermen who wanted more fishing points to supply the reported increase in demand for fish in the emerging mine town of Elizabethville (now Lubumbashi). Later, the Belgians wanted to claim this land. Over the years, during British colonial rule, District Commissioners and Provincial Commissioners were asked to provide information on the affected areas by central government authorities in Lusaka.

The real border issue for the Northern Frontier was reported to be on Lake Tanganyika&#x27;s Cape Akalunga, mentioned in the treaty and described as the point of reference. In reality, officials had found it difficult to locate this cape. British maps show the boundary meeting at Cape Pungu (Chitankwa) whilst Belgian maps of 1955 show the meeting point at Cape Kipimbi which is far south of Cape Pungu, thereby cutting deep into assumed Northern Rhodesian territory.

During the time of the Central African Federation, the Northern-Rhodesian Federal government’s Assistant Secretary Fraser, believed that there may be mineral deposits in Pweto area and therefore all the more need for the Federal Government to protect sovereignty. Weedens Minerals &amp; Chartered Exploration held prospecting rights in that area. These have never been challenged. There is documentation that in 1936, Belgians had asked for 180 acres (730,000 m2) of Northern Rhodesian land apparently where Belgian colonial residences were built. However, no evidence exists that Britain conceded to this request. In 1957, A V Ellison, an official in the Ministry of Lands &amp; Local Government reported to the Federal government of Northern Rhodesia that triangulation surveys had been made by the Anglo-Belgian Boundary Commission from 1911–1913, when eventually a de facto boundary for the northern frontier was agreed upon. That boundary clearly indicates that Pweto was the northwestern point of reference for the northern frontier.

==Belgian interests==

In 1931 another British/Belgian Boundary Commission was set up. A Peake/Gendarme agreement was proposed. It was suggested that a meandering line following the watershed and thalwegs of the streams replace the straight line between Lake Mweru and Lake Tanganyika. This exchange was to favour Northern Rhodesia but was consequently rejected by the Belgians. In July 1958 Thomson, District Commissioner who visited Chief Puta’s area, noted an influx of the populace from the area occupied by Belgians into Northern Rhodesia. They were running away from compulsory agricultural measures in Pweto’s area. The fact is that these were not refugees in the sense the term is used today. They were resisting the brutal Belgium occupation, under which they had been left without British protection. Distance and cost was the simplest excuse that British authorities in Northern Rhodesia could offer for not protecting them. After all, apart from the mining companies, the British definition of its interests in Northern Rhodesia were at best ambivalent, apart from occupying a piece of real estate.

On 8 August 1958, a preparatory meeting for the Belgian government and the Federal Government of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland to discuss the Northern Rhodesia/Congo boundary was convened. Present at the meeting representing Northern Rhodesian interests were:

*A W Osminara – Assistant Secretary and Chair
*W H H Jones – Acting Solicitor General
*T W Fraser – Assistant Secretary (W)
*P W W Allin – Surveyor General
*S G Burlock – Acting Land Commissioner
*M S Wagner – Assistant Secretary (R)
*J C L Durrant – Acting Assistant Secretary (N)
*G Howe – Administrative Officer
*F N N Parry – Federal Government representative
*M S Benoy – 

Belgium interests in the north appeared to be fishing and hunting in the Lake Mweru region, and possession of Kilwa Island. A joint Mweru-Luapula fisheries agreement was made between Northern Rhodesia and Belgium Congo with regards to:

* Type of nets used
* Fishing rights
* Off-season responsibilities

At this meeting, maps and plans of the areas concerned were discussed. Northern Rhodesia needed the Pedicle Road that connects Luapula Province to the Copperbelt. (The Pedicle is a wedge of Congolese territory that cuts deep into Zambia to give the country its distinctive butterfly shape.) Belgians were not interested in the road, but were using it as a bargaining tool for other border issues. The Federal Government initially wanted to put a railway through to Luapula as suggested by the Mufulira Copper Mines Ltd. To build a railway, however, meant the land had to be under Federal government control. Parry also saw the advantage of linking the Rhodesian railway system with that of the Congo. At this point in the colonial period, the rights of native inhabitants were considered insignificant and not worthy of consultation.

While the Federal Government wanted control over the pedicle, the Belgians wanted to swop territory in their favour. The meeting decided to propose the following:

* The Northern Rhodesia government would exchange land on the northwest boundary in the Lubemba area for some of the Mokambo land held by the Belgians. This could have conceded Pweto to Congo.

However, no such swap actually took place in any formal treaty. The Mokambo pedicle remained Belgium Congo territory and yet they still occupied the northern frontier. In effect, a de facto occupation continued without their making any concession.

In the same year, 1958, D F Smith, District Assistant and a team of 11 Africans (2 of whom claimed to know where Cape Akalunga was) visited Mporokoso area to

* Find out the populace
* Find Cape Akalunga

He visited 11 villages. He met with Chief Mulilo who told him Cape Akalunga was near Chisenga River and had once been called Mutunga village. It had been under Congolese rule.

==18 November 1958==

Notes on the Northern Frontier, from the Assistant Secretary to the Executive Council.

a) Belgians concern: Kilwa island, fishing and hunting rights in Lake Mweru area

b) British concern: Nkana trespass, Mokambo strip.

The Assistant Secretary felt that Northern Rhodesia had bargaining power with the northern frontier (the Mpweto line), which the Belgians were keen on. He proposed that the Anglo-Belgian Fisheries Advisory Board meet regularly to resolve each territory&#x27;s fishing rights, to agree on African fishing methods, to agree that the Europeans buy the fish caught by the Africans (Greeks at Mpweto had in the past been doing large scale fishing and refused to buy excess fish from the Africans), to check legislation, and to look into the issue of Belgian Congo&#x27;s desire to hunt crocodiles. The Assistant Secretary noted that the Belgians were uncooperative.

==22 December 1958==

British Consulate General in Leopoldville wrote to the Federal Government Minister of External Affairs in Salisbury. He noted that as the frontier between Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo was situated in Lake Mweru and on the thalweg of the Luapula in a part of its course, it was appropriate for each of the riparian states to exercise their sovereign rights in the waters falling respectively under their jurisdiction.

The maps showed the frontier deviating from the centre of the lake and passing to the west of Kilwa Island which, the Belgians said, was a peninsula attached to Belgian territory.

In the same year, 1958, Mr Bowles visited Brussels and discussed the border issues with M. Grosjean, Inspector General in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. No detailed records are available on this meeting, save to note that the frantic efforts between the British and Belgian authorities were taking place precisely at the time when the struggle for independence of the two states, particularly Congo, were getting intense. Congo gained independence in 1960; Northern Rhodesia got it four years later. In 1958 the British settlers were holding on to the territory and were keen to ensure that no land that they claimed to be theirs was surrendered to natives in the Congo.

==20 March 1961==

Staff Sgt G F Tredwell, Provincial Commissioner for Northern province wrote that Cape Akalunga was north of the Libondwe River and a little south of the Chisenga stream. It was 2 miles in-shore from Lake Tanganyika. It has a valley where Headman Mutunga had a village many years ago, and it is believed that Chief Moliro had his headquarters there too. It was under Belgian administration.

==17 April 1961==

Provincial Commissioner E L Button had, in response to a query about the boundary between Lake Mweru and Lake Tanganyika, commented thus: &quot;Despite the rather nebulous nature of a common boundary, no administrative difficulties had been caused by it, and as such it would be better to let sleeping dogs lie.&quot; Nothing in diplomacy could be as irresponsible as this statement on the question of sovereignty over land, as the case of the submerging Kasikili/Sedudu island issue between Namibia and Botswana in recent years shows. In other words, this Briton was now quite happy to concede Zambian territory to the Congo as a matter of convenience when that was not the case when the British or their proxies were ruling the territory.

==29 April 1961==

Acting Administrative Secretary wrote to the Governor of Northern Rhodesia. He informed the Governor that there were 4 enclaves that were under the Belgian administration, Mpweto- Lunchinda included. The residents were forced to carry Congolese identity cards and been fully subjected to Belgian rule. Chiefs who were living within the sphere of Belgian control provided tribal control.

==February 1965==

There was a border incident on Luapula River, the details of which were not fully recorded. Since both Congo and Zambia had now gained independence, this incident was between two new republics dealing with an issue left over from the colonial period.

==30 April 1965==

Education Minister John Mwanakatwe and Alex Shapi visited Mweru constituency. They were held at gunpoint and manhandled by the Congolese (Katangese) gendarmes after crossing the Lunchinda River at Chipungu. Despite explaining who they were, they were accused of being in Congolese territory. It was not until the following day that a senior Congolese official who spoke Chibemba saved them and apologised for their mistreatment. They crossed the Lunchinda in the knowledge that they were still in Zambian territory, as the maps showed. At this time, there was no clinic at Chipungu, so many Zambians sought medical facilities from the Congolese hospital at Mpweto. Even the Belgium Congolese franc was accepted currency in Chipungu area itself, as it was in Pweto. The fact was, Mwanakatwe was legitimately visiting his constituency, as far as the Zambian map showed.

==30 September 1966==

Two English geologists, Dr Premoli and Dr Bratley, and 22 Zambians were to undertake geological investigations on the coast of Lake Tanganyika between Moliro and Nsumbu bay. They were arrested by the Congolese (Katangese) gendarme and their maps were confiscated. Congo was at war. The Zambian maps showed that this area was Zambian territory.

==November 1966==

In Zambia, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Lands wrote to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs giving reference to the Mpweto/Lake Tanganyika boundary. He pointed out that since the border was not clearly established, negotiation was necessary and suggested the setting of a Joint Boundary Commission.

The Surveyor General, D J B Copeland, in a letter dated 18 August 1966, recalled a boundary incident that had occurred in 1961. Surveyors sent by De Beers Prospecting Ltd had an incident near Mpweto with Congolese officials. The surveyors were accused of being in Congo territory and of illegally prospecting for Congolese gold in Moba territory. This confusion was caused by the following definition of the border.

*Belgian border coordinates South latitude 8 degrees 18 minutes
*British border coordinates South latitude 8 degrees 14 minutes

The Police report showed that they had been arrested at the Chisenga River near Chipunelu.

==30 September 1967==
Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Lishomwa Muuka suggested the need for a boundary commission to discuss the dispute over:

* The Congolese claim of 8 degrees 18 minutes south
* The Zambian claim of 8 degrees 15 minutes south

He saw the need to clarify whether the point was Cape Akalunga or Cape Kipimbi. He wrote to the British High Commissioner for information on the true boundary, but was told there was none available, despite their having been discussions on the delimitation of the boundary in 1927 and 1933 . The British, it appeared had washed their hands of the issue and were not bothered at all if the two countries went to war over a border dispute which they had themselves defended for so many years.

==1968==

The Congolese disputed air space and flying rights over Nippon Mining that had concession rights over Chipushi.

==Summation==
The border issue is a part of the history Chienge District, an area in the northern part of Zambia, on the shores of Lake Mweru. David Livingstone visited the Lake Mweru area in 1867 during his search for the source of the Zambezi River. Following the 1889 Berlin conference and the ensuing Scramble for Africa by European powers, there was interest from Belgians, Germans and the British in Southern and Central Africa in securing the area that covered Lake Nyasa, Lake Mweru, Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria. In the early 1870s the Germans Reichardt and Bohn, and later in 1878, a larger group of Germans led by Wissman, visited the area around Lake Mweru. The Belgians were already looking at colonising the Congo including the area south of Lake Mweru.

Harry H. Johnston wrote in a London newspaper introducing the &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot; concept. He was sent by the Foreign Office to work in Southern Africa, with the African Lakes Company (ALC), which had its headquarters in Blantyre, Nyasaland (now Malawi). Scottish missionaries who were initially interested in stopping the slave trade by Arabs, and later engaged in trading with the locals had originally set up the Company. Johnston became Commissioner of the African Lakes Company, tasked by the British government with:

* Consolidating the Protectorate of His majesty’s Government over the chiefs
* Advising the local chiefs on their external relations with the locals and foreigners
* Securing peace and order
* Ending the slave trade

The Foreign Office was unable to provide adequate funds for his administering of the area under British rule, and therefore Johnston had to turn to Cecil Rhodes, who was the Chairman of the British South Africa Company (BSAC), and struck up a working relationship with him. He implored Rhodes to support his work by providing financial support. This Rhodes willingly did in return for Johnston’s representing the interests of the British South Africa Company in the areas that Johnston was to administer. Rhodes was interested in a future amalgamation with the African Lakes Company, as this would give the BSAC undisputed claim over Nyasaland. Rhodes thus fully funded the establishment of Johnston’s administration. Johnston played a major role in subjecting the area later to be known as North Eastern Rhodesia (NER) under British Crown rule. Sir Johnston was also instrumental in the setting up of the first form of civil service in NER, and which was later improved by his successors Alfred Sharpe and later Robert Edward Codrington.

Based in Blantyre, Johnston was concerned about the influence of the Belgians and Germans in the Congo Free State north of Lake Mweru. He was aware that the 2 German expeditions had visited the area in the 1870s and that both were keen to take control of the area. In order to show British administrative authority and determination to prevent the absorption of NER by the Belgians or Germans, Sir Johnston decided to send a former hunter and now agent of the African Lakes Company, Richard Crawshay, to set up a permanent post on the shores of Lake Mweru in 1890. Crawshay found a spot at Puta, where Chienge stream enters Lake Mweru and set up residence there. The area north of Puta at Mpweto in the Congo Free State was under the administrative control of a Belgian named Captain Jacques. Although the Berlin Conference had more or less divided Africa up by colonial powers, there were no distinct boundaries between Congo Free State and North Eastern Rhodesia. As the Germans had shifted their interest to Tanganyika and Zanzibar where they had set posts, Sir Johnston therefore decided to meet with the only real threat, the Belgian administrator Captain Jacques, and together they agreed on a boundary that would be a line running from the northern tip end of Lake Mweru where the Lualaba leaves Lake Mweru to Cape Akalunga on Lake Tanganyika. This understanding while respected by the establishment of Chienge post, it was not formalised until four years later. The formal agreements on the boundary between the Congo Free State under King Leopold of Belgium and the British Crown of King George represented by Sir Johnston through the African Lakes Company was finalised and signed on 12 May 1894.

Having secured the British post, and boundary, Sir Johnston chose to change the name of Puta and instead called Puta station Rhodesia, after his colleague and financial mentor Cecil Rhodes, also making it the first place historically to bear that name. Crawshay stayed at Rhodesia from 1890 to 1891 when he abandoned the station and returned to Blantyre in Nyasaland.

The peoples living under the administrative control of the Africa Lakes Company in the Lake Mweru region included the Ba Bwile or Ba Ansa under Chiefs Mpweto, Puta, Kalembwe, and Mwabu. Their neighbours to the west were the Shila under Chief Mununga, Nkula and Nshimba, there were to the South the Swahili and the Tabwa under Nsama and Katele. There were also regular visits from the Arabs of the east coast of Africa who were involved in trading in guns, gunpowder, and slaves. For the African Lakes Company, the most important posts were Abercorn on the shores of Lake Tanganyika and Rhodesia on Lake Mweru’s shores, but of similar importance were Sumbu and Kaputa. The people of Kaputa specialized in salt making and bought food from more fertile areas. Johnston was concerned that Crawshay had left the Rhodesia station hastily, and asked Cecil Rhodes to fund a special tour of the area by his second in command to assess the situation there. Cecil Rhodes obliged and Alfred Sharpe, Johnston’s second in command undertook a tour of the area.

When Alfred Sharpe toured the major posts in the Lake Mweru region including Rhodesia (Puta post) and Kaputa, he found that Abdullah bin Suleiman, (known by locals as Selemani) a Swahili chief who lived 60 miles from Kalungwishi, had driven out the people there and was demanding salt tribute from other villages. There was also evidence of slave traders harassing the inhabitants mercilessly. On his return to Blantyre, Sharpe gave a detailed report to Johnston. Sir Johnston decided to reopen the station and sent 2 agents, Kidd and Bainbridge to take control of Rhodesia and continue to show British administrative authority. However, Kidd and Bainbridge did not go to Rhodesia, but instead built a new post at Kafulwe some twenty kilometres from the Puta post on the shores of the Kalungwishi river where it crossed the old road to Kazembe, some 3 miles east off Lake Mweru. They decided to adopt the name of Rhodesia for this post as well, seeing as the old post had been abandoned. Kidd and Bainbridge remained at their new post until 1894 when they both died. It was rumoured that they were poisoned. The local people during this time were given protection by the collector at Rhodesia against the Arabs. Mkula, also known as Nsama after his father, and 4 African soldiers were recruited to assist the collector.

In 1896, Hubert T. Harrington, locally known as Chiana, was given charge over Mweru district. He was transferred where Dr Blair Watson was in charge as collector. Harrington described Kalungwishi as a strongly built Boma with four bastions. Beneath its flagstones were buried Kidd and Bainbridge. He built a barge called the Scotia or Mandala boat, which was written off in 1919 and abandoned at Chienge in 1922. The boat used to travel between Chienge and Kilwa Island. There is oral evidence that Hube Harrington was a relation of the famous Harrington family that settled in the Western province of Zambia and are accredited with the skills of building the first Nalikwanda, the boat of the Litunga of the Balozi. In 1899, Nasoro bin Suleiman, nicknamed Chisesa and a cousin to Abdullah bin Suleiman, was harassing the Ba Bwile and Shila peoples. Harrington arrested Abdullah bin Suleiman and kept him in Kalungwishi prison.

The Rhodesia station was closed after the death of Kidd and Bainbridge and was not reopened until 1907, possibly due to lack of staff. The station was returned to its original post at Puta, Chienge as a Boma. The collectors who reopened this Boma were J. F. Sealy and GT Wenham and they stayed there for the next 3 years. In 1908 the station was temporarily closed due to tsetse flies. In 1909 - 10, Dr JD Brunton, Mr WH Jollyman were sent by Alfred Sharpe to Chienge to help with the sleeping sickness campaign.

The following are the administrators that manned the Chienge Boma thereafter:

1910 S Hillier
1912 G H Jones
1917 PCJ Reardon and wife (January) Reardon went mad and ended up in an asylum.
1917 VR Anley and wife (August)
1918 ACJ Elworthy (October)
1919 S Hillier (December)
1920 Matthews (March)
1920 CP Oldfield (September)
1922 Wickins and wife (April)
In November 1922, the station was closed due to lack of funds.
In April 1925 G H Morton reopened the station

1926 FO Hoare (December)
1927 G H Morton (October) He went mad and was sent to Cape Town asylum
1929 FO Hoare (January)
1929 March, Hoare contracted black water fever and died at Kafulwe on his way to Kawambwa.
1929 JB Thomson (June)
1930 SL Langford (January)
1932 EGF Thomson (March)
1932 SL Langford (September)
In 1933, the Chienge station was closed for lack of staff and funds and the lake Mweru region was amalgamated with Mporokoso.

In 1941, the African Lakes Company surveyed 2010 acres (8 km2) of land in Chienge. The ALC had a farm at Chienge where it was said that there were traces of copper. The district was geologically surveyed by Luangwa concessions, a mining company but they retained no claims and no mines were opened.

Two Seventh Day Adventists Ellingworth and Lewis, missionaries from Chimpempe, visited Ponde mission, which was established in 1933 originally at Kalembwe. They drowned in Lake Mweru and were buried at Ponde on 31 August 1952.

Chienge was after 1933 administered from Mporokoso, later from Kawambwa and in the 1970s, Nchelenge. The current Senior Chief Puta (Kasoma) was christened as Hillier after the administrator Mr S Hillier. Senior Chief Puta Kasoma was born in 1910 and installed as Chief Puta in 1937 after the death of Puta Mulolwa.

Chienge was re-established as a sub-Boma in 1973 under the Kaunda UNIP government’s administration.

Before the end of the first term of President Frederick J.T. Chiluba’s MMD government, a quiet but effective lobby for Chienge to become a full district was mounted Dr Katele Kalumba a nominated member of Parliament and Deputy Minister of Health from November 1991 to May 1996 and full Cabinet Minister of Health thereafter, paid off. Dr Kalumba motives were clear. He had an eye, since joining government, on standing as a Parliamentary candidate for Chienge. A Circular No. 25/96 issued by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Local government and Housing dated 30 October 1996 declared Chienge a new district council pursuant to Section 3 of the Local Government Act No. 22 of 1996. At the time, Bennie Mwiinga was a Minister of Local government and Housing.

The narrative following the 12–13 December 1996 Nchelenge Council meeting defined the new Chienge as the area ‘Starting from the mouth of Kefulwa River on the Lake Mweru, the boundary follows the Kefulwa river in a straight line up to the confluence of Kasinga stream. The Boundary runs in a straight line in the north-easterly direction up to where it meets the Kapako stream; thence the boundary runs in the northerly direction along the stream up to where it meets the Kaputa-Nchelenge administrative boundary; thence it follows along the Kaputa-Nchelenge administrative boundary in the northerly direction up to the Zambia-Zaire international boundary; thence the boundary continues in the westerly direction from the Musungwishi river along the Kaputa-Nchelenge administrative boundary; then it runs in a straight line along the Zambia-Zaire international boundary up to the mouth of Lualaba river where it flows out of lake Mweru. The boundary thence follows the Zambia-Zaire international boundary along the lake Mweru up to the mouth of Kefulwa River, the point of starting”.

Chienge was reborn after 106 years of its first opening. It was inaugurated on Friday the 20 December 1996 witnessed by the newly elected Member of Parliament for Chienge and Minister of Health Dr Katele Kalumba and scores of Party and Government officials. Sitting as a councillor of Chienge, Dr Kalumba, accompanied by the Commissioner of Town and Country Planning in the Ministry of Local Government Dr Khonje, the Director of Health Planning and Development, Mr Vincent Musowe of the Ministry of Health, and presided over by Mr T.S. Phiri, Council Secretary for Nchelenge, witnessed the election of Mr Mwanda of Senior Chief Puta&#x27;s area as the first Council Chairman of the new Chienge, while Mr Bowa from Senior Chief Mununga’s area was his Vice Chairman.

<text>U.S. Route 69 (US 69) is a major north–south United States highway in the central United States. When it was first created, it was only long, but it has since been expanded into a Minnesota to Texas cross-country route. The highway&#x27;s southern terminus (as well as those of US-287 and US-96) is in Port Arthur, Texas at an intersection with State Highway 87. Its northern terminus is in Albert Lea, Minnesota at Minnesota State Highway 13.

==Route description==
===Texas===

US-69 begins at its southern terminus with SH-87 in Port Arthur. This intersection is also the southern terminus for US-96 and US-287, which are concurrent with US-69. US-69, US-96, and US-287 continue in a northwest, then west, route until its intersection with I-10 in southern Beaumont. At this intersection, US-69, US-96, and US-287 merge with I-10. I-10/US-69/US-96/US-287 continue in a northerly direction through Beaumont for several miles. Just after the intersection with US-90, I-10 splits from the multiplex and resumes its easterly course, leaving US-69, US-96, and US-287 heading northwest through Beaumont. US-69 north of I-10 is also known officially known as Eastex Freeway, and is an official evacuation route, just as I-69/US-59 heading north from Houston is known as Eastex Freeway as well.

In Lumberton, US-96 splits from US-69 and US-287 and heads northeast towards Jasper, while US-69 and US-287 continue on a northwest path towards Woodville.

In Woodville, US-69 splits from US-287 a few blocks north of US-190. US-287 continues northwest towards Corrigan while US-69 proceed north towards Lufkin. In this area, between US-190 in Woodville and FM-256 in Colmesneil, US-69 is a part of the Texas Forest Trail. Before reaching Lufkin, US-69 forms another segment of the Texas Forest Trail between SH-63 in Zavalla and FM-1818 northwest of Zavalla.

In Lufkin, US-69 is concurrent with US-59 and State Loop 287 while the route through the city is named Business US-69. US-69, State Loop 287, and US-59 continue around the east side of Lufkin until US-59 separates at the intersection with US-59 Business northeast of Lufkin. US-69 and State Loop 287 continue until the intersection of SH-103 and Business US-69 on the northwest section of Lufkin. At that point, US-69 is concurrent for a short distance with SH-103 and State Loop 287. At the intersection of US-69, State Loop 287 and SH-103, US-69 departs Lufkin and heads northwest while SH-103 and State Loop 287 head south.

US-69 continues on a north to northwest path through the towns of Alto, Rusk, Jacksonville and Bullard. Just south of Bullard, US-69 has a short concurrency with FM-2493. US-69 continues northward into Tyler.

In Tyler, US-69 continues northward through the city and makes up most of &quot;S. Broadway Avenue&quot; from the intersection with Toll 49 until the intersection of SH-110 and SH-155, where US-69 heads west and merges with SH-110 and SH-155 through Tyler. Around seven blocks from the intersection of US-69, SH-110, and SH-155, SH-155 separates from the concurrency and travels in a southwesterly direction, leaving US-69 and SH-110 traveling in a northwesterly direction. This continues until SH-110 separates from US-69 on the northwest side of Tyler. At this intersection, SH-110 heads west while US-69 continues north. Shortly after that, US-69 crosses Loop 323. From here to Mineola, it is signed as &quot;Mineola Highway&quot; except when it is signed as &quot;Main Street&quot; in Lindale.

US-69 crosses I-20 at Lindale where it is signed as &quot;Main Street&quot;. At FM-16 in Lindale, US-69 begins its third and last segment as part of the Texas Forest Trail. Just before leaving Lindale, US-69 has a junction with Toll 49 at the terminus of Toll 49. US-69 from there continues north to northwest to Mineola, crossing US-80 there. Before leaving town, at its intersection with SH-37, the Texas Forest Trail turns off of US-69 to share a segment with SH-37. US-69 takes a more northwest turn on its way through several small towns, including Emory, on its way to Greenville. There, as it begins to enter the city, a Business route of US-69 turns off to the right to serve the downtown Greenville area, and then on to a junction with I-30. At the intersection with I-30, US-69 becomes concurrent with US-380 at its terminus. The concurrency continues around the southern and western sides of Greenville until an intersection with Spur 302. At that intersection, US-380 heads west while US-69 continues north, until it reaches the northern end of its Business route, which has passed through the downtown Greenville area, then US-69 turns northwest, from Greenville to Leonard, where it encounters a brief concurrency with SH-78.

In Whitewright, SH-11 intersects and becomes concurrent with US-69 southeast of town. This continues until the intersection with SH-160, at which time SH-11 continues on a northwestward route and US-69 continues north through Whitewright.

US-69 continues north, then northwest until Denison, where it turns right to go north, at an intersection with Spur 503. US-69 goes north through downtown Denison, then at the north side of town, US-69 intersects and merges with US-75, at which time US-69 becomes concurrent with US-75. Both head northeast across the Oklahoma/Texas state line at the Red River.

===Oklahoma===
US-69 and US-75 pass the Oklahoma border near the tiny town of Staley. They remain concurrent all the way to Atoka, where US-69 heads northeast and US-75 heads northwest. US-69 and US-75 briefly merge with SH-3 in Atoka but SH-3 remains concurrent with US-75 instead of US-69 when they split. In Stringtown, US-69 merges with SH-43. SH-43 splits from US-69 near the Atoka Reservoir and crosses it. US-69 passes right by the McAlester Ammunitions Depot. US-69 passes over Eufaula Lake 6 times. Near Muskogee, US-69 merges with US-64 and SH-2. At an intersection with US-62, US-64 heads west concurrent with US-62 while US-69 and SH-2 continue to head north. South of Pryor Creek, US-69 is the westerly boundary of the MidAmerica Industrial Park, one of the largest industrial park in the nation. Near Vinita, US-69 and SH-2 interchange with Historic Route 66 and US-60. The two highways turn east and merge with HR-66 and US-60. In Downtown Vinita, SH-2 heads north while US-69, US-60 and HR-66 head east, passing I-44 a short while later. At SH-85, the three highways make an unexpected northward turn. The three highways merge with US-59 just south of I-44. Still south of I-44, US-60 heads northeast, paralleling I-44, while HR-66, US-69, and US-59 continue heading north, passing I-44. At SH-10, US-59 heads west concurrent with SH-10, while HR-66 and US-69 head north concurrent with SH-10. In Downtown Miami, SH-10 continues heading east, while HR-66 and US-69 turn northward. South of Picher and west of Quapaw, US-69 meets US-69 Alternate. US-69 splits from HR-66 and heads north through the town of Picher.

===Kansas===
At the Oklahoma/Kansas state line, US-69 is joined by K-7. In Columbus, K-7 continues heading north, while US-69 turns east and merges with US-160. US-69 and US-160 meet US-69 Alternate and US-400 near Crestline, and merges with US-400. East of Cherokee, US-400 splits from the concurrency and heads west toward Cherokee. US-69 and US-160 continue heading north. North of Frontenac, US-160 splits from US-69 and heads east towards Lamar and Springfield, Missouri. US-69 continues heading north. South of Fort Scott, US-69 merges with K-7 again. In Fort Scott, US-54 merges with US-69 and K-7. The three highways continue heading north. North of town, US-54 and K-7 split from US-69 and head west; US-69 continues to head north. South of Pleasanton, US-69 merges with K-52. Northeast of Trading Point K-52 splits from US-69 and heads east. In the Kansas City suburbs, US-69 merges with I-35 and US-56/US-169. US-56, US-69, and US-169 split off from I-35 and heads east on Shawnee Mission Parkway. US-69 then heads north on Metcalf Avenue, rejoining I-35 and heading north. A short while later US-69 breaks off from I-35 and heads north on the 18th Street Expressway into Kansas City, Kansas. The highway then splits off and merges with I-70, US-24, and US-40 and heads east. At the intersection with US-169 at the 7th Street Trafficway, US-69 splits off and heads north. Just before reaching I-635, US-69 crosses into Missouri.

===Missouri===

US-69 enters Riverside, merges with I-635, then almost immediately exits and merges with MO-9, heading east. A half-mile later, US-69 exits from MO-9 and heads north. US-69 passes through Riverside, Northmoor, Gladstone, Claycomo, Pleasant Valley and parts of Kansas City proper before merging with I-35 for a second time, near Liberty. US-69 stays merged with I-35 for before it exits. After exiting the highway, US-69 immediately merges with MO-33 and heads northeast. At State Route B, in rural Liberty, MO-33 heads north-northeast and US-69 continues northeast. US-69 stays somewhat parallel to I-35 as it heads through Missouri, sometimes passing under it. West of Altamont, US-69 merges with MO-6. The highways turn north and a short while later MO-6 splits from US-69 and heads west, while US-69 continues heading north. Southwest of Bethany, US-69 merges with US-136 and heads east into Bethany. In downtown Bethany, US-136 heads east, while US-69 heads north. Still paralleling I-35, US-69 passes into Iowa from Missouri later.

===Iowa===

In Lamoni, US-69 makes a sharp turn toward the east. West of Leon, US-69 merges with Iowa Highway 2. In downtown Leon, US-69 heads north, while Iowa Highway 2 heads east. East of Lake Ahquabi State Park, US-69 merges with US-65. The two highways continue to head north. At the intersection with Iowa Highway 5, US 65 heads east concurrent Iowa Highway 5 and US 69 continues to head north through Des Moines and Ankeny. In Ames, US 69 makes a left turn, then a right turn, and continues heading north. East of Clarion, US 69 briefly merges with Iowa Highway 3. The two highways soon split with Iowa Highway 3 heading east and US-69 heading north through Belmond, Iowa. Near Garner, US-69 briefly heads west concurrent with US-18, but soon splits off from it and heads north. North of Forest City, US 69 merges with Iowa Highway 9 and continues heading north. Iowa Highway 9 soon branches off to the west. Just south of Emmons, US-69 crosses into Minnesota.

===Minnesota===
US-69 enters the state at Emmons and travels north-northeast through southern Minnesota, passing through Twin Lakes. The roadway runs along the eastern shore of Pickerel Lake before entering Albert Lea, where the highway terminates at State Highway 13, formerly US-16.

The Minnesota portion of the highway is in length.

==History==
When it was first commissioned in 1926, US-69 extended only from Leon, Iowa to Kansas City, Missouri. The part in Missouri had been Route 11 since 1922.

The route was extended north into Minnesota in 1934, mostly along what had previously been marked State Highway 13, ending at U.S. 16 in Albert Lea. At this time, it entered the state at Emmons and turned eastward along Lake Street and State Line Road, briefly re-entering Iowa to curve around the south shore of State Line Lake. In 1940, it was realigned to run north-northeast directly to Twin Lakes. The full extent of the roadway in Minnesota was paved in 1941.

In Kansas, US-69 is gaining express lanes from 103rd street to 151st street (6 miles). This project is adding 1 express (toll) lane in each direction without the removal of any existing lanes. This project is scheduled to be complete in late 2025.

<text>CodeCon was an annual conference for software hackers and technology enthusiasts, held every year between 2002 and 2009. CodeCon was not intended to be a computer security conference, but a conference with a focus on software developers doing presentations of technologies, as computer programs, rather than products.

==History==
Bram Cohen and Len Sassaman are credited with devising and organizing the first conference at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco, California in 2002. The conference was the result of discussion on building a small, programmer-focused convention. Some projects discussed at the first CodeCon include BitTorrent and Peek-a-Booty. There were also panel discussions, including one about the legality of hacking, which focused on the actions of the MPAA and RIAA against peer-to-peer file sharing networks.

Later conferences have included discussions on P2P, and the Helios voting system.

Sassaman proposed to his then-girlfriend Meredith L. Patterson during the Q&amp;A after her presentation at the 2006 CodeCon; the two were later married.

<doc id="441529" wikidata="Q420428" url="?curid=441529" title="Transducin">
<text>Transducin (Gt) is a protein naturally expressed in vertebrate retina rods and cones and it is very important in vertebrate phototransduction. It is a type of heterotrimeric G-protein with different α subunits in rod and cone photoreceptors.

Light leads to conformational changes in the G protein–coupled receptor rhodopsin, which in turn leads to the activation of transducin. Transducin activates phosphodiesterase, which results in the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The intensity of the flash response is directly proportional to the number of transducin activated.

==Function in phototransduction==
Transducin is activated by metarhodopsin II, a conformational change in rhodopsin caused by the absorption of a photon by the rhodopsin moiety retinal. The light causes isomerization of retinal from 11-&quot;cis&quot; to all-&quot;trans&quot;. Isomerization causes a change in the opsin to become metarhodopsin II. When metarhodopsin activates transducin, the guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound to the α subunit (Tα) is exchanged for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) from the cytoplasm. The α subunit dissociates from the βγ subunits (Tβγ). Activated transducin α-subunit activates cGMP phosphodiesterase. cGMP phosphodiesterase breaks down cGMP, an intracellular second messenger which opens cGMP-gated cation channels. Phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes cGMP to 5’-GMP. Decrease in cGMP concentration leads to decreased opening of cation channels and subsequently hyperpolarization of the membrane potential.

Transducin is deactivated when the α-subunit-bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. This process is accelerated by a complex containing an RGS (&quot;Regulator of G-protein Signaling&quot;)-protein and the gamma-subunit of the effector, cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase.

==Mechanism of activation==

The Tα subunit of transducin contains three functional domains: one for rhodopsin/Tβγ interaction, one for GTP binding, and the last for activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase.

There are different isoforms of Tα, seen in rod and cone cells. However, the isoforms exhibit functional interchangeability in the phototransduction cascade and shouldn&#x27;t solely account for differences in light sensitivity. Although the focus for phototransduction is on Tα, Tβγ is crucial for rhodopsin to bind to transducin. The rhodopsin/Tβγ binding domain contains the amino and carboxyl terminal of the Tα. The amino terminal is the site of interaction for rhodopsin while the carboxyl terminal is that for Tβγ binding. The amino terminal might be anchored or in close proximity to the carboxyl terminal for activation of the transducin molecule by rhodopsin.

Interaction with photolyzed rhodopsin opens up the GTP-binding site to allow for rapid exchange of GDP for GTP. The binding site is in the closed conformation in the absence of photolyzed rhodopsin. Normally in the closed conformation, an α-helix located near the binding site is in a position which hinders the GTP/GDP exchange. A conformational change of the Tα by photolyzed rhodopsin causes the tilting of the helix, opening the GTP-binding site.

Once GTP has been exchanged for GDP, the GTP-Tα complex undergoes two major changes: dissociation from photolyzed rhodopsin and the Tβγ subunit and exposure of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) binding site for interaction with latent PDE. The conformational changes initiated in the transducin by binding of GTP are transmitted to the PDE binding site and cause it to be exposed for binding to PDE. The GTP-induced conformational changes could also disrupt the rhodopsin/Tβγ binding site and lead to dissociation from the GTP-Tα complex.

===The Tβγ complex===

An underlying assumption for G-proteins is that α, β, and γ subunits are present in the same concentration. However, there is evidence that there are more Tβ and Tγ than Tα in rod outer segments (ROS). The excess Tβ and Tγ have been concluded to be floating freely around in the ROS, though it cannot be associated with the Tα at any given time. One possible explanation for the excess Tβγ is increased availability for Tα to rebind. Since Tβγ is crucial for the binding of transducin, reacquisition of the heterotrimeric conformation could lead to more rapid binding to another GTP molecule and thus faster phototransduction.

Though Tβγ has been mentioned to be crucial for Tα binding to rhodopsin, there is also evidence that Tβγ may have a crucial, possibly direct role in nucleotide exchange than previously thought. Rhodopsin was found to specifically cause a conformational switch in the carboxyl terminal of the Tγ subunit. This change ultimately regulates the allosteric nucleotide exchange on the Tα. This domain could serve as a major area for interactions with rhodopsin and for rhodopsin to regulate nucleotide exchange on the Tα. Activation of the G protein transducin by rhodopsin was thought to proceed by the lever mechanism. Rhodopsin-binding causes helix formation at the carboxyl terminal on the Tγ and brings the Tγ carboxyl and Tα. Carboxyl terminals closer together to facilitate nucleotide exchange. Tα can accelerate the rate of activation of light-off induced Protein Kinase A due to binding to rhodopsin. As well as, transducin achieves full functional activation upon binding to activated rhodopsin.

Mutations in this domain abolish rhodopsin-transducin interaction. This conformational switch in the Tγ may be preserved in the G protein γ subunit family.

===Interaction with cGMP phosphodiesterase and deactivation===

Transducin activation ultimately results in stimulation of the biological effector molecule cGMP phosphodiesterase, an oligomer with α, β and two inhibitory γ subunits. The α and β subunits are the larger molecular weight subunits and make up the catalytic moiety of PDE.

In the phototransduction system, GTP-bound-Tα binds to the γ subunit of PDE. There are two proposed mechanisms for the activation of PDE. The first proposes that the GTP-bound-Tα releases the PDE γ subunit from the catalytic subunits in order to activate hydrolysis. The second more likely mechanism proposes that binding causes a positional shift of the γ subunit, allowing better accessibility of the catalytic subunit for cGMP hydrolysis. The GTPase activity of Tα hydrolyzes GTP to GDP and changes the conformation of the Tα subunit, increasing its affinity to bind to the α and β subunits on the PDE. The binding of Tα to these larger subunits results in another conformational change in PDE and inhibits the hydrolysis ability of the catalytic subunit. This binding site on the larger molecular subunit may be immediately adjacent to the Tα binding site on the γ subunit.

Although the traditional mechanism involves activation of PDE by GTP-bound Tα, GDP-bound Tα has also been demonstrated to have the ability to activate PDE. Experiments of PDE activation in the dark (without the presence of GTP) show small but reproducible PDE activation. This can be explained by the activation of PDE by free GDP-bound Tα. PDE γ subunit affinity for GDP-bound Tα, however, seems to be about 100-fold smaller than for GTP-bound Tα. The mechanism by which GDP-bound Tα activates PDE remains unknown however, it is speculated to be similar to the activation of PDE by GTP-bound Tα.

In order to prevent activation of PDE in the dark, the concentration of GDP-bound Tα should be kept to a minimum. This job seems to fall to the Tβγ to keep the GDP-bound Tα bound in the form of holotransducin.

For deactivation, hydrolysis of the bound GTP by the Tα is necessary for Tα deactivation and returning the transducin to its basal from. However, simple hydrolysis of GTP may not necessarily be enough to deactivate PDE. Tβγ comes into play here again with an important role in PDE deactivation. The addition of Tβγ facilitates inhibition of the PDE catalytic moiety because it binds with the Tα-GTP complex. The reassociated form of transducin is not able to bind to PDE any longer. This frees PDE to recouple to photolyzed rhodopsin and return PDE to its initial state to await activation by another GTP bound Tα.

<text>U.S. Highway 96 (US 96) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway that runs for about entirely in the U.S state of Texas. Its number is a violation of the standard numbering convention, as even-numbered two-digit highways are east–west routes by rule. As of 2004, the highway&#x27;s southern terminus (as well as those of US 287 and US 69) is in Port Arthur at an intersection with State Highway 87 (SH 87). Its northern terminus is in Tenaha at an intersection with US 59 (Future I-69)/(Future I-369) and US 84 (Future I-69).

U.S. Highway 96 is designated by the State of Texas as a major hurricane evacuation route, with the local county governments facilitating the evacuation of citizens along U.S. Highway 96 from Coastal Region counties, including but not limited to, Harris County, Galveston County, Brazoria County, Chambers County, Jefferson County, Orange County, Hardin County, Jasper County, Newton County and Tyler County.

U.S. Highway 96 has been utilized many times in the past for hurricane evacuations, with the most recent being Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav in 2008, Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Laura in 2020. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, U.S. Highway 96 was also utilized to route evacuees from Louisiana, who had fled west out of the hurricane&#x27;s path. This designated hurricane evacuation route is utilized to evacuate citizens to the north into North and Northeast Texas, Northwest Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma, out of the range of a hurricane&#x27;s deadly winds, tornadoes, flooding and storm surge.

U.S. Highway 96 also serves as a major Strategic Military Highway, connecting Fort Polk in Leesville, Louisiana and the Red River Army Depot near Texarkana, Texas to the Port of Beaumont in Beaumont, Texas. This Strategic Military Highway is utilized regularly by the Department of Defense for transporting military personnel, materials, equipment and vehicles to and from the Port of Beaumont in support of military deployments and operations overseas, as well as the national defense mission here in the United States.

Additionally, U.S. Highway 96 is a major highway utilized for transporting citizens, goods and services to and from four Texas ports, including Beaumont, Port Arthur and Orange, as well as Intersecting Interstate 10, which connects U.S. Highway 96 to the Port of Houston.

Plans to upgrade the existing connecting route of U.S. Highway 190 to Interstate 14 and U.S. Highway 59 to Interstate 69 will increase the connectivity of U.S. Highway 96 for strategic military transport, commercial and travel purposes, connecting this artery to three major Interstate Highway Corridors, including I-10, I-14 and I-69/U.S. 59.

U.S. Highway 96 is also the primary transportation route from the Texas Coastal Region to access Lake Sam Rayburn and Lake B.A. Steinhagen, the Neches and Angelina Rivers, the Angelina National Forest, the Masterson State Forest (Established 1985) in Buna, Texas and the Daughters of the American Revolution State Forest (Established 1929) in Cairo Springs, Texas.

==Route description==
US 96 begins at SH 87 in Port Arthur, at a southern terminus it also shares with US 69 and US 287. The three highways head in a northwest direction toward Beaumont. In Beaumont, the three highways briefly merge with Interstate 10 (I-10), but then split from that freeway continuing northwest. In Lumberton, US 96 separates from US 287 and US 69, and heads northeast towards Silsbee. In Silsbee, US 96 splits with US 96F, a special route of US 96 that serves downtown Silsbee, while being routed on a bypass freeway. After Silsbee, US 96 heads northeast to Buna, then north to Kirbyville and Jasper. After Jasper. US 96 comes near the Sam Rayburn Reservoir near Pineland. US 96 eventually comes to its northern terminus near Tenaha at a junction with US 59 (Future I-69)/(Future I-369) and US 84 (Future I-69).

==History==
In 1927 US 96 was originally routed: Beginning at Rosenburg via Wharton, Victoria, Beeville, Skidmore, Alice, Falfurrias, San Juan to Brownsville.

In 1933, the present route of US 96 was originally proposed to be part of US 71. Under this plan, discussed at a meeting of the United States Good Roads Association in Beaumont, US 71 was to be diverted out of Louisiana altogether and instead re-routed from the Texarkana area southward through East Texas.

In 1935, US 96 was rerouted to Laredo instead of Brownsville. 03/01/1935 - Beginning at Rosenburg, Wharton, Victoria, Beeville, Skidmore, Mathis, Alice, Laredo. This is the current route of US 59.

In the 1935, US 59 was initially routed from Teneha to Port Arthur following the basic route of the current US 96. US 96 began in Rosenburg (Near Houston) and roughly followed the current route of US 59 to Alice then on to Brownsville and later was rerouted to Laredo.

Minute Order 016701, dated 09/26/1939 radically re-aligned US 96 to travel a route formerly used by US 59: From Tenaha via Center, San Augustine, Jasper, Buna, Voth, and Beaumont to Port Arthur (Shelby, San Augustine, Sabine, Jasper, Hardin, and Jefferson Counties). This renumbered US 59 and 96 beginning in Teneha to roughly their current paths. SH 35 from Teneha to Houston had become US 59. The entirety of the pre-1939 US 96 had been changed to US 59 and US 59 South of Teneha had been renumbered to US 96.

==Future==
As part of the I-14 System in Texas project, US 96 between Jasper and Beaumont is proposed to be upgraded to interstate standards. The interstate segment would begin at either US 190/SH 63 (Future I-14) and head southward before terminating at I-10.

==Major intersections==




























==Business routes==
===Buna business highway===


Business U.S. Highway 96-E (US 96 Bus.) is a spur of US 96 in the Jasper County census designated place of Buna. The highway was designated on September 25, 1939 as Texas State Highway Loop 68, going from US 59 through Buna to US 59. On January 18, 1955, Loop 68 became Texas State Highway Spur 68, and the route was moved to the current route. On June 21, 1990, the designation was changed to Business US 96-E, and a concurrency with SH 62 was added. It begins southwest of the community at US 96 and travels northeast paralleling a railroad. Except for one small industry, the highway travels past residential areas before it ends at SH 62 in the center of Buna. A left turn onto SH 62 can be made to access US 96 again.

===Silsbee business highway===
Business U.S. Highway 96-F (US 96 Bus.) is a business loop of US 96 serving the Hardin County city of Silsbee. The highway begins at an interchange with US 96 south of the city and travels north to the city limits as a four-lane undivided road. Upon reaching the Silsbee city limits, the name of the road also becomes 5th Street. In the center of the city, US 96 Bus. reaches Avenue N which carries SH 327. At Avenue G, US 96 Bus. turns right while FM 92 continues north through the city. FM 418&#x27;s eastern terminus occurs at a stop-controlled T intersection east of the city center. At the highway&#x27;s northern intersection with US 96, US 96 Bus. briefly runs on two frontage roads on either side of US 96 before it terminates at right-in/right-out intersections with the divided US 96.
The route was originally designated on Texas State Highway Loop 498 on November 30, 1978. The route was changed to Business US 96-F on June 21, 1990. 

The number was originally used for Texas State Highway Spur 498, designated on April 29, 1971 from SH 146 to Spur 501 in LaPorte via Wharton Weems Blvd. This was cancelled on July 28, 1977 and mileage was transferred to rerouted Loop 410 (not to be confused with I-410), whose alignment on Fairmont Parkway was cancelled and given to the city of LaPorte. Loop 410 was marked as Business SH 146, and became Business SH 146-D on June 21, 1990. Note that the sections of Business SH 146-D on Broadway Street and Main Street were cancelled on March 26, 2009 and given to the city of LaPorte.

<text>A taxis (; : taxes ) is the movement of an organism in response to a stimulus such as light or the presence of food. Taxes are innate behavioural responses. A taxis differs from a tropism (turning response, often growth towards or away from a stimulus) in that in the case of taxis, the organism has motility and demonstrates guided movement towards or away from the stimulus source. It is sometimes distinguished from a kinesis, a non-directional change in activity in response to a stimulus. taxis can be positive (moving towards the stimulus) or negative (moving away from the stimulus).

== Classification ==
Taxes are classified based on the type of stimulus, and on whether the organism&#x27;s response is to move towards or away from the stimulus. If the organism moves towards the stimulus the taxis are positive, while if it moves away the taxis are negative. For example, flagellate protozoans of the genus &quot;Euglena&quot; move towards a light source. This reaction or behavior is called &quot;positive phototaxis&quot; since phototaxis refers to a response to light and the organism is moving towards the stimulus.

=== Terminology derived from type of stimulus ===
Many types of taxis have been identified, including:
* &quot;Aerotaxis&quot; (stimulation by oxygen)
* &quot;Anemotaxis&quot; (by wind)
* &quot;Barotaxis&quot; (by pressure)
* &quot;Chemotaxis&quot; or &quot;gradient search&quot; (by chemicals)
* &quot;Durotaxis&quot; (by stiffness)
* &quot;Electrotaxis&quot; or &quot;galvanotaxis&quot; (by electric current)
* &quot;Gravitaxis&quot; or &quot;geotaxis&quot; (by gravity)
* &quot;Hydrotaxis&quot; (by moisture)
* &quot;Magnetotaxis&quot; (by magnetic field)
* &quot;Phototaxis&quot; (by light)
* &quot;Rheotaxis&quot; (by fluid flow)
* &quot;Thermotaxis&quot; (by changes in temperature)
* &quot;Thigmotaxis&quot; (by physical contact)

Depending on the type of sensory organs present, a taxis can be classified as a &quot;klinotaxis&quot;, where an organism continuously samples the environment to determine the direction of a stimulus; a &quot;tropotaxis&quot;, where bilateral sense organs are used to determine the stimulus direction; and a &quot;telotaxis&quot;, where a single organ suffices to establish the orientation of the stimulus.

=== Terminology derived from taxis direction ===
There are five types of taxes based on the movement of organisms.

* &quot;Klinotaxis&quot; occurs in organisms with receptor cells but not paired receptor organs. The cells for reception may be located all over the body, but often towards the anterior side. The organism detects the stimuli by turning its head sideways and comparing the intensity of the stimulus. Their direction of movement is then based on the stronger stimulus, either moving toward a desirable stimulus or away from an undesired one. When the intensity of stimuli is balanced equally from all sides, the organism moves in a straight line. The movement of blowfly and butterfly larvae clearly demonstrates klinotaxis.
* &quot;Tropotaxis&quot; is displayed by organisms with paired receptor cells, comparing the strength of the signals and turning toward the strongest signal. The movement of grayling butterflies and fish lice clearly demonstrates tropotaxis.
* &quot;Telotaxis&quot; also requires paired receptors. The movement occurs along the direction where the intensity of the stimuli is stronger. Telotaxis is clearly seen in the movement of bees when they leave their hive to look for food. They balance the stimuli from the sun as well as from flowers but land on the flower whose stimulus is most intense for them.
* &quot;Menotaxis&quot; describes organisms&#x27; maintenance of a constant angular orientation. A clear demonstration is shown by bees returning to their hive at night and the movement of ants with respect to the sun.
* &quot;Mnemotaxis&quot; is the use of memory to follow trails that organisms have left when travelling to or from their home.

== Examples ==
* Aerotaxis is the response of an organism to variation in oxygen concentration, and is mainly found in aerobic bacteria.
* Anemotaxis is the response of an organism to wind. Many insects show a positive anemotactic response (turning/flying into the wind) upon exposure to an airborne stimulus cue from a food source or pheromones. Cross-wind anemotactic search is exhibited by some olfactory animals in the absence of a target odor including moths, albatrosses, and polar bears. Rats have specialized supra-orbital whiskers that detect wind and cause anemotactic turning.
* Chemotaxis is a response elicited by chemicals: that is, a response to a chemical concentration gradient. For example, chemotaxis in response to a sugar gradient has been observed in motile bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot;. Chemotaxis also occurs in the antherozoids of liverworts, ferns, and mosses in response to chemicals secreted by the archegonia. Unicellular (e.g. protozoa) or multicellular (e.g. worms) organisms are targets of chemotactic substances. A concentration gradient of chemicals developed in a fluid phase guides the vectorial movement of responder cells or organisms. Inducers of locomotion towards increasing steps of concentrations are considered as chemoattractants, while chemorepellents result moving off the chemical. Chemotaxis is described in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, but signalling mechanisms (receptors, intracellular signaling) and effectors are significantly different.
* Durotaxis is the directional movement of a cell along a stiffness gradient.
* Electrotaxis (or galvanotaxis) is the directional movement of motile cells along the vector of an electric field. It has been suggested that by detecting and orienting themselves toward the electric fields, cells can move towards damages or wounds to repair them. It also is suggested that such a movement may contribute to directional growth of cells and tissues during development and regeneration. This notion is based on the existence of measurable electric fields that naturally occur during wound healing, development and regeneration; and cells in cultures respond to applied electric fields by directional cell migration – electrotaxis / galvanotaxis.
* Energy taxis is the orientation of bacteria towards conditions of optimal metabolic activity by sensing the internal energetic conditions of cell. Therefore, in contrast to chemotaxis (taxis towards or away from a specific extracellular compound), energy taxis responds on an intracellular stimulus (e.g. proton motive force, activity of NDH- 1) and requires metabolic activity.
* Gravitaxis (known historically as geotaxis) is the directional movement (along the vector of gravity) to the center of gravity. The planktonic larvae of a king crab, &quot;Lithodes aequispinus&quot;, combine positive phototaxis (movement towards the light) and negative gravitaxis (upward movement). Also the larvae of a polychaete, &quot;Platynereis dumerilii&quot;, combine positive phototaxis (movement to the light coming from the water surface) and UV-induced positive gravitaxis (downward movement) to form a ratio-chromatic depth-gauge. Both positive and negative gravitaxes are found in a variety of protozoans (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Loxodes&quot;, &quot;Remanella&quot; and &quot;Paramecium&quot;).
* Magnetotaxis is, strictly speaking, the ability to sense a magnetic field and coordinate movement in response. However, the term is commonly applied to bacteria that contain magnets and are physically rotated by the force of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. In this case, the &quot;behaviour&quot; has nothing to do with sensation and the bacteria are more accurately described as &quot;magnetic bacteria&quot;.
* Pharotaxis is the movement to a specific location in response to learned or conditioned stimuli, or navigation by means of landmarks.
* Phonotaxis is the movement of an organism in response to sound.
* Phototaxis is the movement of an organism in response to light: that is, the response to variation in light intensity and direction. Negative phototaxis, or movement away from a light source, is demonstrated in some insects, such as cockroaches. Positive phototaxis, or movement towards a light source, is advantageous for phototrophic organisms as they can orient themselves most efficiently to receive light for photosynthesis. Many phytoflagellates, e.g. &quot;Euglena&quot;, and the chloroplasts of higher plants positively phototactic, moving towards a light source. Two types of positive phototaxis are observed in prokaryotes: scotophobotaxis is observable as the movement of a bacterium out of the area illuminated by a microscope, when entering darkness signals the cell to reverse direction and reenter the light; a second type of positive phototaxis is true phototaxis, which is a directed movement up a gradient to an increasing amount of light. There is a different classification to orientation towards dark areas called scototaxis.
* Rheotaxis is a response to a current in a fluid. Positive rheotaxis is shown by fish turning to face against the current. In a flowing stream, this behaviour leads them to hold their position in a stream rather than being swept downstream. Some fish will exhibit negative rheotaxis where they will avoid currents.
* Thermotaxis is a migration along a gradient of temperature. Some slime molds and small nematodes can migrate along amazingly small temperature gradients of less than 0.1 °C/cm. They apparently use this behaviour to move to an optimal level in soil.
* Thigmotaxis is the response of an organism to physical contact or to the proximity of a physical discontinuity in the environment (e.g. rats preferring to swim near the edge of a water maze). Codling moth larvae are believed to use thigmotactic sense to locate fruits to feed on. Mice and rats, when inhabiting human-made structures, tend to stick close to vertical surfaces; this primarily manifests as running along the floor/wall juncture. Whiskers (vibrissae) are often used to detect the presence of a wall or surface in the absence of sufficient light in rodents and felines to aid in thigmotaxis.

<doc id="441545" wikidata="Q432812" url="?curid=441545" title="Ray Hyman">
<text>Ray Hyman (born June 23, 1928) is a Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon, and a noted critic of parapsychology. Hyman, along with James Randi, Martin Gardner and Paul Kurtz, is one of the founders of the modern skeptical movement. He is the founder and leader of the Skeptic&#x27;s Toolbox. Hyman serves on the Executive Council for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

==Career==
Hyman was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts to a Jewish family. Although he was bar mitzvahed at 13, Hyman &quot;never had a religious feeling&quot;. In his teenage years and later while attending Boston University, he worked as a magician and mentalist, impressing the head of his department (among others) with his palmistry. Hyman at one point believed that &#x27;reading&#x27; the lines on a person&#x27;s palm could provide insights into their nature, but later discovered that the person&#x27;s reaction to the reading had little to do with the actual lines on the palm. This fascination with why this happened led him to switch from a journalist degree to psychology.

JREF president D.J. Grothe asked Hyman &quot;How does a young psychology student get into this parapsychology racket ... why you?&quot; Hyman replied that it began when he was hired as a magician at age 7 (as the &quot;Merry Mystic&quot;) performing for the Parents and Teachers Association at his school. This led him to read all about Harry Houdini and his work with spiritualists. By the age of 16 he started investigating spiritualist meetings. Thinking back to age 7, &quot;I can&#x27;t ever remember not being a skeptic&quot;.

Magicians who perform mentalism debate among themselves about using a disclaimer. The disclaimer is supposed to inform the audience that what they are witnessing is entertainment, and is not based on actual paranormal powers. In an interview with mentalist Mark Edward, Edward asked Hyman if he had ever used a disclaimer during the six years when he performed professionally as a mentalist. Hyman told him he did not remember explicitly using a disclaimer. He remembered always beginning the performance by stating that he did not claim any special powers. He was an entertainer and he hoped they would enjoy the show. After he became a psychologist, he realized that this was an example of the &quot;invited inference.&quot; By openly stating that he made no claims about the nature of his ability, Hyman had given his audience no reason to challenge him. Indeed, he had invited the onlookers to make their own inferences about the source of the apparent feats of mind reading. Most of them concluded he was truly psychic.

He obtained a doctorate in psychology from Johns Hopkins University in 1953, and then taught at Harvard for five years. He also became an expert in statistical methods. In 2007 Hyman received an honorary doctorate from the Simon Fraser University for his &quot;intellect and discipline who inspire others to follow in his footsteps... (and) for his courageous advocacy of unfettered skeptical inquiry&quot;. In 1982, Hyman held the &quot;Spook Chair&quot; for one year at Stanford University during a sabbatical from the University of Oregon. What the Stanford University psychologists informally call the &quot;Spook&quot; chair is officially known as The Thomas Welton Stanford Chair for Psychical Research. Thomas Welton was the brother of Stanford&#x27;s founder, Leland Stanford.

Along with other notable skeptics like James Randi, Martin Gardner, Marcello Truzzi and Paul Kurtz, he was a founding member of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) (which is now known as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)), which publishes the Skeptical Inquirer. He also developed a style guide and etiquette manual to assist skeptical writers and critics. This is called &quot;Hyman&#x27;s Proper Criticism&quot; and proposes six steps that skeptics can use to upgrade the quality of their criticism.

Aside from his scholarly publications and consultation with the U.S. Department of Defense in scrutinizing psychic research, one of his most popular articles is thirteen points to help you &quot;amaze your friends with your new found &quot;psychic powers&quot;!&quot;, a guide to cold reading. According to Jim Alcock, &quot;His article on cold reading, so Paul Kurtz informs me, has generated more requests for reprints than any other article in the history of the Skeptical Inquirer&quot;. The guide exploits what fascinated him in his academic research in cognitive psychology, that much deception is self-deception. He has investigated dowsing in the United States and written a book on the subject. He is one of the foremost skeptical experts on the Ganzfeld experiment. According to Bob Carroll, psychologist Ray Hyman is considered to be the foremost expert on subjective validation and cold reading.

Hyman&#x27;s prestidigitational skills (which he calls &quot;manipulating perception&quot;) have earned him the cover of &quot;The Linking Ring&quot; twice, June 1952 and October 1986 this magazine of the International Brotherhood of Magicians of which he has been a member for over 35 years.

Hyman retired in 1998 but continues to give talks and investigate paranormal claims. In July 2009 he appeared at The Amaz!ng Meeting 7 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Also in 2011, TAM 9 &quot;From Outer Space&quot; and TAM 2012. He is working on two books: &quot;How Smart People Go Wrong: Cognition and Human Error&quot; and &quot;Parapsychology&#x27;s Achilles&#x27; Heel: Consistent Inconsistency&quot;.

On October 9, 2010, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry announced Hyman (and others) as a part of their policy-making Executive Council, he will also serve on Skeptical Inquirer&#x27;s magazine board. 
== History of skeptical movement ==
In the 2010 D.J. Grothe interview, Hyman states that the formation of the skeptic movement can be attributed to Uri Geller and Alice Cooper. Randi was touring with Cooper as a part of the stage show, Cooper asked Randi to invite Hyman to a show in order to ask his advice about the audience. While there, &quot;Randi pulled me aside and said... we really ought to do something about this Uri Geller business... lets form an organization called SIR&quot; (Sanity In Research). In 1972 joined by Martin Gardner they had their first meeting. The three of them felt they had no administration experience, &quot;we just had good ideas&quot; and were soon joined by Marcello Truzzi who provided structure for the group. Truzzi involved Paul Kurtz and they then formed CSICOP in 1976.

In an interview in 2009 with Derek Colanduno for the &quot;Skepticality&quot; podcast, Hyman was asked his opinion of the modern skeptical movement. Hyman responded that skeptics need to have goals and a way to measure them. They need to become a resource for the public, and focus on educating journalists and teachers. &quot;That way we will get more bang for our buck.&quot; On the current state of the skeptical movement, Hyman stated &quot;The media, unfortunately has made it so we have many more believers.&quot; Less science teachers in the classrooms, major newspapers are firing their science writing staff, 24-hour news channels are trying to fill all that time and compete with Fox News. &quot;Things are not good.&quot;

==Skeptic&#x27;s Toolbox==
Hyman in 1989 created the Skeptic&#x27;s Toolbox to teach people how to be better skeptics. Hyman tells James Underdown that &quot;we were putting out more fires by skeptics than by believers... they were going overboard&quot;. The first toolbox was in Buffalo, NY with himself, James Alcock and Steve Shaw now called Banachek. With the exception of one year when the toolbox was held in Boulder, CO the toolbox has been held at the University of Oregon in Eugene. The Skeptic&#x27;s Toolbox originally spanned 5 days. Later it was cut back to 4 days.

Speaking to a reporter from The Register-Guard Hyman explains that people come from all over the country to attend the 4-day conference, to hone their critical thinking skills. Hyman is curious about why people who believe in paranormal claims without evidence continue to do so: &quot;&#x27;I just want to understand how people get to believe some things... Magic is a perfect example of how people can be fooled&#x27;&quot; and it works the same way with paranormal claims. Hyman felt that it was necessary to teach attendees with a &quot;case-based approach... concrete examples as a first step toward extracting broad examples... (giving) the benefit of context&quot; to the learning experience. This approach differs from that of a traditional conference: he has attendees use hands-on participation, splitting them into teams so they are able to spend quality time discussing the readings and lectures. At the 2014 Toolbox, Hyman used Oskar Pfungst’s investigation of Clever Hans as an example of how detailed and exhaustive some investigators are in studying claims.

==Hick-Hyman Law==
Hyman published his &quot;classic paper showing that human choice reaction time is related to the information content of an incoming signal&quot; called the Hick-Hyman Law. This helped to lay the groundwork &quot;for the shift from behavioral psychology... to the era of cognitive psychology.&quot; This was Hyman&#x27;s second published paper, and submitted while still a grad student. He states that Hick used a different formula and got his &quot;math wrong, which I corrected&quot; but they still named the law after him because Hyman was &quot;just a student&quot;. Sometimes called Hick&#x27;s Law (mainly in Britain), in America it is more often referred to as the Hick-Hyman Law.

==Remote viewing review==
Along with Jessica Utts, he conducted a review of CIA remote viewing experiments in 1995. He noted that the experiments &quot;appear to be free of the more obvious and better known flaws that can invalidate the results of parapsychological investigations&quot; and that there are significant effect sizes &quot;too large and consistent to be dismissed as statistical flukes.&quot; However, he stops short of &quot;concluding that the existence of anomalous cognition has been established.&quot;

== Ganzfeld experiments ==
While working at Stanford University and serving as the &quot;Spook Chair&#x27;&quot; Hyman decided that he would never be able to read all the literature concerning parapsychology that existed in the 1980s. He then asked parapsychologists &quot;What is the best evidence for psi?&quot; they nearly universally pointed to the Ganzfeld experiment. Hyman wrote to Charles Honorton and was sent 600 pages of information. Three years later Hyman&#x27;s analysis led to the 1985 issue of the &quot;Journal of Parapsychology&quot; publishing Hyman&#x27;s critiques. Hyman&#x27;s conclusion &quot;By themselves these experiments do not mean anything unless they can be replicated&quot;.

In 2007, Hyman noted that the ganzfeld experiments had not been successfully replicated and suggested there was evidence that sensory leakage had taken place in the autoganzfeld experiments.

== Uri Geller and Stanford Research Institute ==
Magician Jerry Andrus and Hyman appeared in 1975 on a TV station in Portland, Oregon, where they explained and duplicated the &quot;paranormal&quot; tricks Geller had performed for host Dick Klinger the week prior. Klinger asked, &quot;Does Uri Geller have any supernatural powers?&quot; Andrus gave the short answer &quot;No.&quot; Hyman stated, &quot;(Geller) is an opportunist... which is why it is difficult to duplicate him, he himself cannot duplicate himself. He&#x27;s always ready to do something... he is going to do something when you think he is doing something else... misdirection... he&#x27;s excellent at it, he&#x27;s superb.&quot;

In 1972 Hyman was asked by The Department of Defense to investigate psychic Uri Geller. Hyman was intrigued by a story that Geller had taken a ring from one of the scientists, set it on a table, and without touching it, the ring stood on end, broke in half and formed itself into a S-shape. Upon questioning all the scientists at the lab, Hyman discovered that no one had actually seen this happen, but had heard stories from others (who could not be tracked down) that it had happened.&quot; Hyman continued to question the scientists and discovered that no one had ever seen Geller bend anything without touching it. In fact &quot;Geller was allowed to take the object into the bathroom... and then come back with the bent object, they took his word for it.&quot; &quot;The parapsychologist (also sent to investigate) &#x27;saw a psychic,&#x27; and I reported back that I saw only a charismatic fraud.&quot;

When asked to explain further why people believe in Geller when a magician can do the same thing without paranormal powers, Hyman states, &quot;He&#x27;s a fraud, but you can&#x27;t blame people for believing him. Geller is a product of a wonderful public relations campaign... What the audience gets is only one side of the story... He has been caught cheating many times&quot; but people still believe. Speaking as a psychologist Hyman says &quot;If you get people in the right frame of mind and they are cooperating with you... and even give them a poor reading... they will fit it to themselves and believe you are telling them about their unique personality.&quot;

== Gary Schwartz ==
Gary Schwartz conducted numerous experiments at his laboratory at the University of Arizona where he is a tenured professor. Schwartz believes that he has proven the dead communicate with the living through human mediums. Hyman details many methodological errors with Schwartz&#x27;s research including; &quot;Inappropriate control comparisons&quot;, &quot;Failure to use double-blind procedures&quot;, &quot;Creating non-falsifiable outcomes by reinterpreting failures as successes&quot; and &quot;Failure to independently check on facts the sitters endorsed as true&quot;. Hyman wrote &quot;Even if the research program were not compromised by these defects, the claims being made would require replication by independent investigators.&quot; Hyman criticizes Schwartz&#x27;s decision to publish his results without gathering &quot;evidence for their hypothesis that would meet generally accepted scientific criteria... they have lost credibility.&quot;

There have been many follow-up exchanges between Schwartz and Hyman over the &quot;Afterlife Experiments&quot; conducted by Schwartz. Published May 2003, Schwartz responded that Hyman ignored &quot;the total body of research.&quot; Schwartz takes issue with Hyman&#x27;s opinion that he (Hyman) will not believe in psi. Hyman answered, &quot;Until multiple perfect experiments are performed and published... believe that the totality of the findings must be due to some combination of fraud, cold reading, rater bias, experimenter error, or chance... Why spend the time and money conducting multiple multi-center, double-blind experiments unless there are sufficient theoretical, experimental, and social reasons for doing so?&quot;

==Proper Criticism==

Hyman wrote a brief guide called Proper Criticism directed at critics of paranormal claims. It has widely been dispersed among Skeptics working in the public eye, including the editorial staff at &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;. It is also featured in his book The Elusive Quarry.

Proper Criticism gives eight suggestions for approaching criticism thoughtfully in a way that is &quot;both effective and responsible&quot;

1. Be prepared: have responses prepared for commonly asked questions about Skepticism

2. Clarify your objectives: assess your own intentions and determine your intended audience. Hyman warns against criticism motivated by bad intentions, such as attacking the claimant instead of the claim.

3. Do your homework: research to understand the claimant&#x27;s argument

4. Do not go beyond your level of competence: admit what you do not know and consult experts when needed

5. Let the facts speak for themselves: if you have thoroughly prepared, let the audience reach the conclusion on their own

6. Be precise: use precise language, be as accurate as possible. While discussing Proper Criticism on the Squaring the Strange Podcast, Benjamin Radford expanded on this advice, &quot;often times ambiguous or fuzzy words or concepts reveal ambiguous or fuzzy thinking and obfuscation&quot; 

7. Use the principle of charity: give the claimant the benefit of the doubt. Also on Squaring the Strange Podcast, Celestia Ward has called this the opposite of the Straw man fallacy, advising critics formulate responses to the strongest interpretation of the claimant&#x27;s argument.

8. Avoid loaded words and sensationalism: instead, choose long term credibility

<text>USS &quot;S-27&quot; (SS-132) was a &quot;S&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-27&quot;′s construction was authorized in March 1917, and her keel was laid down on 11 April 1919 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 18 October 1922, sponsored by Mrs. Frank Baldwin, and commissioned at Groton, Connecticut, on 22 January 1924.

==Service history==
Based at New London, Connecticut, through 1924, &quot;S-27&quot; transferred to the Pacific in 1925, and, after exercises in the Hawaiian Islands during the spring of 1925, arrived at her new homeport, San Diego, California, in June 1925. She was based in Southern California until 1931 and, except for fleet maneuvers, operated primarily off that coast. Fleet maneuvers, exercises, and Fleet Problems took her to the west coast of Central America, to the Panama Canal Zone, into the Caribbean Sea, and to Hawaii.

In 1931, &quot;S-27&quot; was transferred to Hawaii, and on 23 February 1931 she arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, from which she operated until 16 June 1939, when she departed for San Diego. She arrived there on 27 June 1939 and resumed operations off the coast of Southern California, conducting exercises and tests, primarily for the Underwater Sound Training School. In late November 1941, she proceeded to Mare Island, California, where she began an overhaul.

===World War II===
&quot;S-27&quot; still was undergoing overhaul when the United States entered World War II with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor of 7 December 1941. After completion of her overhaul, she stood out of San Francisco Bay on 23 January 1942 and headed south. On 26 January 1942 she arrived at San Diego, and where resumed operations for the Underwater Sound Training School, which she continued into the spring of 1942. Then ordered north to the Aleutian Islands, she departed San Diego on 20 May 1942, proceeded to Port Angeles, Washington, and then continued on to the waters of the Territory of Alaska, where she commenced patrol operations.

On 12 June 1942, a little over a week after the beginning of the Aleutian Islands campaign, &quot;S-27&quot; put into Dutch Harbor on Amaknak Island off Unalaska in the Aleutian islands, took on provisions, refueled, and then headed west with orders to patrol in the Kuluk Bay area on the northeastern side of Adak Island and reconnoiter Constantine Harbor on the coast of Amchitka. On the night of 16–17 June 1942, she received orders to move to Kiska. On 18 June 1942, she reconnoitered Constantine Harbor, found no signs of enemy activity in the evacuated village there, and moved on to round the southern end of Amchitka, from which she would proceed to Kiska. In mid-afternoon on 18 June 1942, she rounded East Cape.

===Grounding and loss===

When &quot;S-27&quot; surfaced on the evening of 18 June 1942, fog obscured her position. Lying to, to charge her batteries on both engines, she was carried about from her estimated position based on dead reckoning position. The fog prevented her crew from detecting that she was drifting. At midnight, she got underway slowly on one engine and continued to charge on the other. Soon after 00:43 on 19 June 1942, her crew sighted breakers about forward of her bow. &quot;Back emergency&quot; orders were given, but seconds later she grounded on rocks off St. Makarius Point.

Waves bumped &quot;S-27&quot; violently against the rocks, rolling her 10° to 15° on each side. Her engines continued at &quot;back emergency&quot;, but a submerged rock held her firmly. Her crew dumped fuel to lighten her and continued efforts to back off the rocks, but the lightened submarine only swung harder against the rocks. Her starboard screw struck a rock and was disabled. &quot;S-27&quot;′s crew attempted to force her ahead to clear the stern, but she only moved about forward before the rocks again held her fast. Her crew sounded the immediate area, but found no passage. She transmitted the first of six distress signals at 01:15, but Dutch Harbor received only one of them, and it did not give her position.

By 03:30, the pounding of the sea had increased, and &quot;S-27&quot; commanding officer, Lieutenant H. L. Jukes, made plans to move the greater part of her crew off, and her crew set up a ferry system, using a rubber boat and lines rigged between the submarine and the beach. Men, provisions, clothing, guns, and medical supplies were transferred safely to Amchitka. By 11:00, all but six of her crew — Jukes and five others — were ashore. The men still aboard destroyed &quot;S-27&quot;s equipment and burned her classified material. By 15:30, &quot;S-27&quot;′s side plating was loose and her torpedo room was flooding and three of the remaining men went ashore. At 15:50, the last three men — the radioman, the executive officer, and Jukes — left the submarine.

&quot;S-27&quot;′s crew spent the night of 19–20 June 1942 in an unsheltered cove. On 20 June 1942, the crew set up camp at Constantine Harbor, using buildings and heating equipment there which had survived a Japanese bombing. By 21 June 1942, the camp was fully organized, with established routines, including sentries and lookouts. Trips to and from the cove continued for three days. &quot;S-27&quot; crewmembers reboarded her on 21 and 22 June 1942 to take off more supplies, but thereafter, the presence of poisonous chlorine gas due to the reaction of seawater with her battery cells precluded further visits.

On 24 June 1942, a U.S. Navy PBY Catalina flying boat piloted by Lieutenant, junior grade, Julius A. Raven, USNR, on a routine flight spotted the activity at Constantine Harbor, landed, and took off 15 of the survivors. On 25 June 1942, three planes arrived to take off the remainder. The men destroyed all guns they had salvaged from &quot;S-27&quot; before they departed, leaving behind nothing except &quot;S-27&quot;′s abandoned wreck and canned provisions, blankets, and winter clothing.

<doc id="441549" wikidata="Q2525533" url="?curid=441549" title="Breast self-examination">
<text>Breast self-examination (BSE) is a screening method used in an attempt to detect early breast cancer. The method involves the woman herself looking at and feeling each breast for possible lumps, distortions or swelling.

BSE was once promoted heavily as a means of finding cancer at a more curable stage, but large randomized controlled studies found that it was not effective in preventing death, and actually caused harm through needless biopsies, surgery, and anxiety. The World Health Organization and other organizations recommend against BSE. Other organizations take a neutral stance, and do not recommend for or against BSE. 

Breast awareness is an informal alternative to breast self-examinations, where women acquaint themselves with their breasts in order to become more aware of any changes in their bodies without practicing regularly scheduled self-examinations and any patient-observed change or abnormality in the breast anatomy are reported to a healthcare team for further evaluation. 

==Limitations==

According to a meta-analysis in the Cochrane Collaboration, two large trials in Russia and Shanghai found no beneficial effects of screening by breast self-examination &quot;but do suggest increased harm in terms of increased numbers of benign lesions identified and an increased number of biopsies performed&quot;. They concluded, &quot;At present, screening by breast self-examination or physical examination cannot be recommended.&quot;

Although breast self-examination increases the number of biopsies performed on women, it does not reduce from breast cancer. In a large clinical trial involving more than 260,000 female Chinese factory workers, half were carefully taught by nurses at their factories to perform monthly breast self-exam, and the other half were not. The women taught self-exam detected more benign (normal or harmless lumps) or early-stage breast disease, but equal numbers of women died from breast cancer in each group.

Because breast self-exam is not proven to save lives, it is no longer routinely recommended by health authorities for general use. It may be appropriate in women who have a particularly high risk of developing breast cancer. Some charitable organizations still promote BSE as a universal screening approach, even in the low-risk women who are most likely to be harmed by unnecessary follow-up procedures. Writer Gayle A. Sulik, in her book &quot;Pink Ribbon Blues&quot;, suggests that these charities are motivated by their donations depending on fear of breast cancer. Among groups promoting evidence-based medicine, awareness of breast health and familiarity with one&#x27;s own body is typically promoted instead of self-exams.

Breast self-examinations are based on the assumption that cancer develops by steady growth of the tumor. According to breast cancer specialist and surgeon Susan Love, &quot;Breast cancer doesn&#x27;t work like that...it&#x27;s sneaky. You could examine yourself every day and suddenly find a walnut.&quot;

Among women with high-risk BRCA mutations, about 10% said that performing breast self-examination increased their anxiety. Half of those who did perform BSE felt that it gave them a sense of control.

Learning breast self-examination increases a woman&#x27;s level of depression, worrying, and anxiety about breast cancer. Greater anxiety about breast cancer is associated with a higher likelihood of performing BSE. Women are also more likely to perform BSE if they have experienced a false positive error from screening mammography (being wrongly told that breast cancer may be present, when the woman is actually cancer-free).

==Methods==

A variety of methods and patterns are used in breast self-exams. Most methods suggest that the woman stand in front of a mirror with the torso exposed to view. She looks in the mirror for visual signs of dimpling, swelling, or redness on or near the breasts. This is usually repeated in several positions, such as while having hands on the hips, and then again with arms held overhead.

The woman then palpates her breasts with the pads of her fingers to feel for lumps (either superficial or deeper in tissue) or soreness. There are several common patterns, which are designed to ensure complete coverage. The vertical strip pattern involves moving the fingers up and down over the breast. The pie-wedge pattern starts at the nipple and moves outward. The circular pattern involves moving the fingers in concentric circles from the nipple outward. Some guidelines suggest mentally dividing the breast into four quadrants and checking each quadrant separately. The palpation process covers the entire breast, including the &quot;axillary tail&quot; of each breast that extends toward the axilla (armpit). This is usually done once while standing in front of the mirror and again while lying down.

Finally, women that are not breastfeeding gently squeeze each nipple to check for any discharge.

Various devices are used as teaching devices. One is called the &quot;seven P&#x27;s of BSE&quot;, after seven steps that are named to have the same first initial: &quot;Positions&quot;, &quot;Perimeter&quot;, &quot;Palpation&quot;, &quot;Pressure&quot;, &quot;Pattern&quot;, &quot;Practice&quot;, and &quot;Planning&quot; what to do if a change is found in the breast tissue.

For pre-menopausal women, most methods suggest that the self-exam be performed at the same stage of the woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle, because the normal hormone fluctuations can cause changes in the breasts. The most commonly recommended time is just after the end of menstruation, because the breasts are least likely to be swollen and tender at this time. Women who are postmenopausal or have irregular cycles might do a self-exam once a month regardless of their menstrual cycle.

Teaching correctly performed breast self-examinations normally takes a trained professional seven to ten minutes.

==Recommendations==
The World Health Organization, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, and many other scientific organizations recommend against the use of breast self-examinations. Also, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners states that teaching women to perform breast self-examination is no longer recommended. In the US, however, there is no consensus among organizations related to breast self-examination as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the American Medical Association recommend monthly breast self-examination while the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, the US Preventative Services Task Force, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network neither recommend nor discourage breast self-examination. 

It is currently being investigated whether breast self examination would be useful as an alternative screening technique in remote areas where women do not have access to regular mammogram tests or comprehensive gynecological care, but more research is required to form a consensus.

==History==
Activists began promoting breast self-examination in the 1930s because their exhortation to not delay seeking treatment for suspicious lumps was not affecting the death rate.

In the 1950s and 1960s, a film demonstrating breast self-examination, which was co-sponsored by the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute, was shown to millions of American women.

In the 1970s, researchers began to report that women were being told to do this even though there had never been any evidence to suggest that it saved lives.

<text>The lesser spotted eagle (Clanga pomarina) is a large Eastern European bird of prey. Like all typical eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. The typical eagles are often united with the buteos, sea eagles, and other more heavy-set Accipitridae, but more recently it appears as if they are less distinct from the more slender accipitrine hawks than believed.

==Description==

This is a medium-sized eagle, about in length and with a wingspan of . Its head and wing coverts are pale brown and contrast with the generally dark plumage. The head and bill are small for an eagle. Usually, a white patch occurs on the upper wings, and even adults retain a clearly marked white &quot;V&quot; on the rump; the wing markings are absent and the white &quot;V&quot; is not well-defined in the greater spotted eagle.

The juvenile has less contrast in the wings, but the remiges bear prominent white spots. It differs from greater spotted eagle juveniles by a lack of wing covert spotting and the presence of a cream-colored neck patch.

The call is a dog-like &quot;yip&quot;.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

The birds formerly considered to be the resident Indian subspecies are now considered a separate species, the Indian spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga hastata&quot;), quite distinct and readily separable by morphological, behavioral, ecological, and DNA sequence data. The European taxon is actually closer to the greater spotted eagle; their common ancestor seems to have diverged around the middle Pliocene, perhaps some 3.6 million years ago, from the ancestors of the Indian birds. The &quot;proto-spotted eagle&quot; probably lived in the general region of Afghanistan, being split into a northern and a southern lineage when both glaciers and deserts advanced in Central Asia as the last ice age began. The northern lineage subsequently separated into the eastern (greater) and western (lesser) species of today, probably around the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary not quite 2 million years ago.

The present species hybridizes occasionally with the greater spotted eagle. Hybrid birds are almost impossible to identify if not seen up close.

==Distribution and habitat==

The lesser spotted eagle breeds in Central and Eastern Europe and southeastward to Turkey and Armenia; and winters in Africa. This is a very wary species of open or lightly wooded country, in which it hunts small mammals (especially voles, ground squirrels, rats, and mice) and similar terrestrial prey, such as small birds, amphibians, reptiles, and occasionally insects (including termites). It is known to occasionally feed on carrion.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

The lesser spotted eagle uses regularly spaced territories consistently between years in the north-western part of its distribution. The distances between territories vary across the region, although this was not found to be related to breeding success. Synchronous variation in breeding success across the region indicates that the eagles are instead influenced by large-scale factors such as fluctuations in climate or prey availability.
The lesser spotted eagle lays one to three white, buff-spotted eggs in a tree nest. As usual for eagles, only in breeding seasons with very abundant prey does more than one young fledge, but the female starts incubating when the first egg has been laid, thus the first young to hatch usually outgrows its clutch mate(s) and will kill and even eat them sooner or later.

<text>The greater spotted eagle (Clanga clanga), also called the spotted eagle, is a large migratory bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. 

It is a member of the subfamily Aquilinae, commonly known as &quot;booted eagles&quot;. It was once classified as a member of the genus &quot;Aquila&quot;, but has been reclassified to the distinct genus &quot;Clanga&quot;, along with the two other species of spotted eagle. 

During breeding season, greater spotted eagles are widely distributed across Eastern Europe, parts of Central Europe, central Russia, central Asia and parts of China, along with other isolated areas. During winter, they migrate, primarily to South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the upper Mediterranean Basin, and parts of East Africa. Greater spotted eagles favor wetter habitats than most other booted eagles, preferring riparian zones as well as bogs, lakes, ponds, and other bodies of water surrounded by woodland. They breed primarily on floodplains, especially ones that experience high water levels. During winter and migration, they often seek out similar wetland habitats, but have also been observed in dry upland areas such as savanna plateaus. 

The eagle is an opportunistic forager, especially during the winter. It will readily scavenge a variety of food sources, including carrion, as well as small mammals (principally rodents), frogs, and a variety of smaller birds (especially water birds), and occasionally reptiles and insects. The eagle is primarily an aerial hunter, gliding from concealed perches over marshes or wet fields to catch prey. 

This species builds stick nests in large trees, laying a clutch of one to three eggs. The female of a pair incubates and broods the young while the male hunts and delivers prey. Parents rarely raise more than one fledgling per year. As is common among a few species of raptors, the oldest chick is much larger than its younger siblings, and will often attack and kill the younger siblings. 

The greater spotted eagle&#x27;s range overlaps with the closely-related lesser spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga pomarina&quot;). The two species are known to breed together frequently, forming hybrid offspring, which is detrimental to the population of the rarer greater spotted eagles. The greater spotted eagle is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Its populations are threatened by habitat destruction, collisions with objects, and hybridization with lesser spotted eagles.

==Taxonomy and etymology==

Greater spotted eagles are members of the Aquilinae, or &quot;booted eagles&quot;, subfamily, a monophyletic group within the larger Accipitridae family. All booted eagles have feathers covering their legs. Members of this diverse, wide-ranging family may be found on every continent except Antarctica. Thirty-eight species of booted eagle are recognized. 

Booted eagles are often grouped with the genera &quot;Buteo&quot; and &quot;Haliaeetus&quot;, and other more heavy-set Accipitridae, but they may be more closely related to the slenderer accipitrine hawks than previously believed. The greater spotted eagle&#x27;s closest living relative is the lesser spotted eagle. They are believed to have diverged from their most recent common ancestor around the middle Pliocene, approximately 3.6 million years ago (mya). This &quot;proto-spotted eagle&quot; probably lived in the general region of modern-day Afghanistan, and split into northern and southern lineages when both glaciers and deserts advanced in Central Asia at the start of the last ice age. The northern lineage subsequently separated into the greater (eastern) and lesser (western) spotted eagle species of today, probably around the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary, almost 2 mya.

Spotted eagles were classified as part of the genus &quot;Aquila&quot;, along with several other mostly large, brownish eagles. However, molecular phylogenetic studies using one mitochondrial and two nuclear gene sequences showed that the spotted eagles form a monophyletic group with each other and the long-crested eagle (&quot;Lophaetus occipitalis&quot;). Studies suggest that the spotted eagles should be grouped with &quot;Lophaetus&quot;, or that all of these species should be grouped within &quot;Aquila&quot;. Furthermore, a close relationship has been found between the spotted eagles and the black eagle (&quot;Ictinaetus malaiensis&quot;) native to Asia. The spotted eagles, long-crested eagle, and black eagle may comprise a species complex or clade. The spotted eagles were ultimately reclassified as a distinct genus, &quot;Clanga&quot;, due to overwhelming genetic evidence and large divergences in morphology and ecology between spotted eagles and their sister taxa. The scientific name &quot;Clanga&quot; may derive from Ancient Greek (), or its root may be the Greek word (a variant form of ) for &quot;a kind of eagle&quot; as mentioned by Aristotle.

Extensive hybridization between the greater spotted eagle and the lesser spotted eagle occurs perhaps because the two species have one of the closest relationships of any closely studied &quot;Accipitrid&quot; taxa, despite significant genetic differences. The mitochondrial genetic sequences of these species have more than 3% divergence, about twice what is considered the minimum genetic difference to distinguish two species. A third spotted eagle, the Indian spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga hastata&quot;), was recognized as a distinct species from the similarly-sized lesser spotted eagle in 2006. 

==Description==
The greater spotted eagle is rather large and compact. Normally, it is black-brown with a contrasting yellow beak. This species has a short neck with a large and often shaggy-naped head, a strong beak, and a short gape-line with round nostrils. The wings are broad and long, reaching the tail tip. The tail is relatively short and rounded. The overall effect of the broad wings and short tail can give them an almost vulture-like silhouette. The feet are large, and the feathers covering the legs are less compactly arranged than on lesser spotted eagles.

Greater spotted eagles tend to perch in the open. Most perches are on treetops at a forest edge, or more isolated vantage points such as a bush, utility pole, or steep riverbank. It is not uncommon for greater spotted eagles to forage from the ground, or rest there in a somewhat hunched posture. 

Adult greater spotted eagles are generally a rather uniform dark to blackish brown, though the coloration may appear purplish and glossy. They may appear more starkly contrasted when freshly moulted. 

The upperwing covert feathers are often a shade paler than the rest, though these eagles generally appear uniformly dark with two contrasting features: a pale beak and a narrow white U above the tail, though the latter is usually concealed at rest. The species is sexually dimorphic or even polymorphic. Pale and intermediate phenotypes are rare, although they can be slightly more common in eastern ranges. 

Pale adults, sometimes referred to as &quot;Clanga clanga fulvescens&quot;, have bicolored plumage. The tail, flight feathers, and greater wing coverts are all blackish, with the body and the rest of the wing coverts appearing light yellow or pale golden buff, sometimes becoming creamy when aged. The buff colour of the &quot;fulvescens&quot; phenotype is usually contrasted with diffuse dark coloring around the eyes, on the leading edges of wings, and more rarely and sparsely on the chest. Intermediate and other variants are very rare, but include those with a slightly paler body and variable yellowish-brown streaking or mottling on the fore upperwing coverts (which can make them look similar to juvenile lesser spotted eagles), or mottled yellow-brown with a dark-streaked breast and pale-tipped wing coverts (like the juvenile eastern imperial eagle (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;)). These intermediate types may show the typical dark brown to black on the upper body, but in flight display pale mottled grey wing linings, or even normal coloration apart from the contrasting paler underbody.

The juvenile greater spotted eagle is generally uniformly black-brown with whitish to yellowish drop-shaped spots. Some juveniles appear heavily spotted all over, while others are less so. They always show an obvious row of spots along the upperwing coverts, forming clear wing bars tail and flight feathers, except the outer primaries. Juveniles&#x27; feathers underneath are often broadly cream-tipped, often showing some buffy streaks below, especially on the flanks and trousers. In &quot;fulvescens&quot;-type greater spotted eagles, juveniles are like the pale adult but show the typical heavily spotted wings and tail of typical juveniles, and often show some darker centers to the scapulars and median coverts. By the second to third year, the plumage is often considerably worn but white tips still create sufficiently prominent wing bars (unlike in lesser spotted eagles) until the second winter, when most coverts are then newly molted with smaller pale tips. From about the middle of third year onwards, the plumage is more adult-like with few or no indistinct spots left, but remiges are of unequal age and untidy looking. The subadult is generally more uniform in color, but often still shows some pale tips to the greater coverts. Maturity is obtained by about the fifth year, though sometimes they may not breed until the sixth. The bare parts change little in color at different ages, with eyes being dark brown, while the beak and feet are yellow in all ages. 

In flight, this is a large, dark raptor (often looking bigger than its true size) with a well-protruding head, long wings (which often look shorter due to their broadness), slightly bulging secondaries, and rather squared seven-finger tips, although juvenile wings can look more rounded. On the wing, greater spotted eagles appear heavy-bodied, often appearing suspended below the wings and with a relatively short, broad tail. They have quick wing beats with little upstroke and appear to have comparatively lighter flight actions than steppe eagles (&quot;Aquila nipalensis&quot;), but appear somewhat heavier, less graceful, and less &quot;Buteo&quot;-like than lesser spotted eagles. Greater spotted eagles soar on almost flat wings, with hands often slightly lowered and their primaries well spread. When gliding, the wings are bowed with a clear angle between arms and hands, emphasizing the wings&#x27; short look.

On their upperwings, greater spotted eagles variably show a pale primary patch formed mainly by white based shafts and partially pale outer webs. This is seen at all ages but is much smaller and less obvious on adults. The underwing almost invariably has a single white crescent formed by the white base of the outermost three primaries, the secondaries, and the innermost primaries. At close range, nine to eleven dense narrow dark bars fading toward wing tips are visible. When seen in flight, the normal adult is uniformly blackish with a faint pale U above the tail, barely paler wing coverts, and paler quills. It is not unusual for adults to have slightly paler wing linings, similar to lesser spotted eagles, but only a single (not double) whitish crescent at the base of primaries. In &quot;fulvescens&quot; (pale) morph adults, most of the wing coverts on both surfaces and body are contrastingly buffy to tawny.

Juveniles on the wing normally appear very dark with liberal spotting above and below, though some juveniles appear with spots restricted to wings, scapulars, and trousers. All juveniles, when seen well, show characteristic white end spots on wing coverts forming two to three wing bars. Otherwise, the juvenile has a creamy trailing edge to the wings and tail. Below, juvenile greater spotted eagles have largely black (apart from the creamy crissum) wing linings contrasting with paler grayer-soot flight feathers. Other juvenile plumages are variably paler but with quills as those of a typical juvenile.

Birds that breed in the Volga–Ural area are slightly larger and more muted in plumage characteristics. Slightly smaller individuals seem to be prevalent farther west in Europe. There appears to be a near 5% size difference in favor of Indian wintering birds over Middle Eastern ones.

===Size===

The greater spotted eagle is a medium-sized eagle, but also a large raptor. This species shows strong sexual dimorphism in favor of the female in size, though the plumage is similar between sexes. The size difference is up to 26% linearly, and females can be as much as twice as heavy as the males, making them rival the martial eagle (&quot;Polemaetus bellicosus&quot;) as possibly the most sexually dimorphic member of the &quot;Aquilinae&quot;. However, the largest male greater spotted eagles can overlap in most linear and mass measurements with smaller females. The total length of full-grown greater spotted eagles can vary from . In wingspan, males have been reported to measure while females can measure . Body mass for males has been reported to range from , while females range from . Among standard measurements, wing chord can range in males and in females. The shortish tail varies in males and in females. The fairly long tarsus is in males and in females. Reportedly, the culmen length can range from .

===Vocalizations===
The greater spotted eagle is quite noisy when breeding and is often very vocal in winter, especially when in small loose flocks. The most common call, often heard during intraspecies conflicts, is a soft, one-syllable, penetrating, high-pitched, urgent whistle, variously transcribed as &quot;kyack&quot;, &quot;kluh&quot;, &quot;tyuck&quot;, or &quot;dyip&quot;. The call is not unlike that of lesser spotted eagles but is slightly deeper and more ringing. The calls are higher pitched than steppe eagles&#x27; and much higher pitched than those of the eastern imperial eagles (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;), the latter having a guttural call somewhat reminiscent of a frog. Additionally, a similar three-syllable bark is seemingly used to warn off intruders at a feeding site, sometimes considered a harsh &quot;chrr-chrr-chaa-chaa&quot;, &quot;kyak-yak-yak&quot;, and &quot;kyew-kyew-kyew&quot;. The cumulative effect of the repeated call has been compared to that of a &quot;small hound&quot;. As with many raptors, the female’s tone is lower pitched and hoarser. One individual greater spotted eagle recorded over two days was found to utter an unusual ringing call that sounded remarkably similar to the first two syllables of the typical call of the crested serpent eagle (&quot;Spilornis cheela&quot;).

===Identification===

Field identification of greater spotted eagle can be quite difficult. This species is primarily differentiated from lesser spotted eagles by its structure and proportions, though distant birds may be practically indistinguishable. Compared to the lesser spotted eagle, the adult appears very broad winged, which in turn makes the head look relatively small. However, greater spotted juveniles can appear less bulky, narrower, more rounded along the wing, and longer-tailed, making their proportions closer to the lesser.

Greater spotted eagles can be clearly larger in size, with females effectively dwarfing most lesser spotted eagles, but there is a broad size overlap between the two species. In some cases, male greater spotted eagles can be scarcely any larger than male lesser spotted eagles. Side-by-side, greater spotted eagles are typically conspicuously darker than lesser spotted eagles, and notable for their dark uppertail coverts, lack of nape patch, blackish-brown uniform arms, and uniform, dark upperwing coverts (not contrastingly rusty brownish). Although difficult, intermediate greater spotted eagles can be distinguished from young lesser spotted eagles by the former&#x27;s morphology, usually darker wing linings, and differences in appearance of primary patch and carpal arc. The juvenile usually lacks the pale nape patch of the lesser spotted eagle, but it is sometimes present, &quot;albeit only slightly paler than rest of plumage and never ochre or orange&quot;. Typically, the spotting and barring pattern is much stronger in juvenile greater spotted eagles, but this is not always reliable.

Hybrids of the two spotted eagles can be more difficult to distinguish, and are often muddled and varied in appearance, with some hybrids being much closer in appearance to one species or the other. Pure greater spotted eagles can be told from pure lesser spotted eagles via in-hand measurements such as bill height, width and extent of white spots on the juvenile, and the length of middle toe.

The greater spotted eagle on the Indian subcontinent might be confused with Indian spotted eagles. The Indian species is smaller (similar in size to the lesser spotted eagle), somewhat narrower-winged and longer-tailed, with primary fingers more deeply cut and square-ended. The Indian species has a more distinct pale window in primaries, paler and less distinctly streaked underparts, and paler upperparts (more like a steppe eagle in color) with less distinct, more diffuse pale tips to the larger wing-coverts. Furthermore, the Indian spotted eagle has a notably deeper gape extending behind its eye.

Compared to non-spotted eagles of similar or larger sizes, the greater spotted eagle tends to be fairly compact in features with proportionately broad (and short-looking) wings, a shortish tail, and an overall darker and distinctly patterned plumage. The steppe eagle is similar to but larger and bulkier than the greater spotted eagle, which has a shorter neck, smaller bill with a shorter gape line, no pale nape patch (seen in adult steppe), narrower and less baggy trousers, and generally much shorter, slightly broader wings. Although visually similar at a distance, the steppe eagle has bolder, more extensive barring on the greyer flight feathers, complete lack of carpal arcs below, paler throat and nape, and larger but more diffuse primary patch.

Greater spotted eagles of the &quot;fulvescens&quot; and intermediate morphs resemble a large number of eagles, but can be distinguished by underwing colour and pattern—such as their distinct carpal arc and dark, thinly barred quills—from pale or intermediate morphs of the similarly sized tawny eagle (&quot;Aquila rapax&quot;), which is usually less darkly backed without a defused dark face and possesses more typical, narrower wing proportions. Juveniles of the eastern imperial eagle can resemble &quot;fulvescens&quot; greater spotted eagles but are larger and appear structurally different. The imperial has much longer and narrower wings, a longer neck, a bigger, more prominent beak with an oblong (rather than oval) nail, a longer and narrower gape line, more conspicuous pale inner primaries, no carpal arc, a brown-streaked breast (though greater spotteds can show some diffuse marks), unmarked tarsal feathering, pale irides, and an obvious pale window on inner primaries. Beyond structural dissimilarities, subadult steppe eagles can be distinguished from paler morph greater spotted eagles by the former&#x27;s thicker well-spotted quill bars and paler underwing diagonal. In the eastern portion of range, they can be told apart from the even darker black eagle, which is much slimmer and has paddle-shaped wings and a long and clearly barred tail.

==Distribution and habitat==
===Breeding range===
This raptor breeds primarily in the Palearctic and the Indomalayan regions. It also breeds in central and southeastern Europe; however, it is highly restricted to small, non-contiguous pockets in Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, and Hungary. A more continuous breeding range begins in Eastern Europe and includes the eastern parts of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and central Belarus. An uncertain number of breeding birds spill over into the edge of eastern Finland. They are found broadly throughout European Russia, where habitat is favorable up through much of Arkhangelsk Oblast to as far as the lower coasts of the White Sea. They are found across much of Central Russia, with their probable northern limits being in Shuryshkarsky and Pitkyarantsky Districts. They are also found in a broad strip across southern Siberia reaching well into the Amur region. Their range outside Russia includes much of northern Kazakhstan, with isolated breeding areas known in the East Kazakhstan Region and in southern Kazakhstan. Greater spotted eagles also breed in an isolated area reaching from Kyrgyzstan and adjacent areas of Russia down to Xinjiang in China. At times, greater spotted eagles have been known to breed in the Indian subcontinent, reportedly from Gujarat northwards to Punjab, with recorded breeding as far south as Saurashtra and as far north as Maharashtra. However, this may only be historical, and there is almost certainly not a stable breeding population today. They also breed in northern Mongolia, and rather far into Northeastern China and northern North Korea.

===Migratory range===
Greater spotted eagles disperse widely during migration, usually through September to November in the fall, and February to April in the spring. They are found more widely during migration than during breeding or wintering. While migrating, greater spotted eagles may be seen in much of Eastern Europe, Anatolia, and throughout the Middle East, Central Asia (from Kazakhstan south), and western South Asia.

This species is prone to vagrancy, and has been reported in several countries in Europe including the Netherlands, Great Britain, Gibraltar, and the Czech Republic. Its regular breeding range no longer extends as far westwards as Germany, but birds are still occasionally seen there with a few records per decade. Young birds also disperse widely; the Staatliches Museum für Tierkunde Dresden has a specimen (C 21845) shot in November 1914 near Bernsdorf in Saxony. It is a juvenile, and though its exact age cannot be determined, it is heavily spotted and probably less than 20 months old.

Additionally, vagrancy has been reported in Africa, including in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Cameroon, Chad, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, and Botswana. It is sometimes documented in central and east Afghanistan. They also may also be found in East Asia across the southern part of the Russian Far East, eastern China, and occasionally in Southeast Asia from Myanmar and Thailand down through the Malay Peninsula. Occasionally, greater spotted eagles are documented even in Indonesia (i.e. Sumatra).

===Wintering range===
Dedicated wintering areas tend to be more limited and isolated than their range during migration. The central wintering areas are principally the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, and the Indomalayan realm. Small pockets may exist in southwestern Spain and bordering Portugal, South France, northeastern Italy, western Greece (where it is sometimes considered the most common wintering eagle), small areas of southern Bulgaria, eastern Romania, and southern Moldova. Other wintering areas including northeastern Egypt, southern Sudan and adjacent South Sudan, north-central Ethiopia, and scattered areas of the Middle East including northern Israel, Kuwait, and central Syria. More continuously, they are found through much of the southern coastal Arabian Peninsula, including broadly along the Red Sea coast in Saudi Arabia, west and southern Yemen, southern Oman, coastal United Arab Emirates, and eastern Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, they winter in southeastern Turkey, Azerbaijan, southeastern Georgia, eastern Iraq, broadly in western, northern and eastern Iran, southern Turkmenistan, western Afghanistan, and far western Pakistan. They are also found discontinuously in eastern Pakistan, northern India, Bangladesh, southern Bhutan, and into northwestern Myanmar. In India, the winter range is through the Indo-Gangetic Plain to Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal to Assam (including the North Cachar hills), and northeastern hill states extending south through central India. They were once reasonably common in the Malabar and Carnatic coasts but likely only before a hundred years ago. After another gap, they are found in much of southern and central Myanmar, central and southern Thailand, southern Laos, the northern tip of Vietnam, discontinuously in southeastern Vietnam and much of Cambodia, and southern coastal Malaysia. In China, wintering greater spotted eagles range from Jiangsu and Anhui continuously down to northern Guangdong across to Taiwan, and rarely in Korea.

===Habitat===

Greater spotted eagles are found in open wet forests and forest edges, often adjoining marshes, swampy patches, bogs, or wet meadows, as well as river-valley woodlands and floodplain forests. They are generally found in wetlands more often than lesser spotted eagles, but can be found in drier hillside forests in Central Asia. The difference in habitat preferences between these species was confirmed in northeastern Poland, where greater spotted eagles nested in wooded areas on floodplains with considerably more annual flooding than those nested in by lesser spotted eagles.

Although typically scarce while breeding in areas modified by heavy human development, they have been seen hunting over cultivated land in Estonia and migrating over lowland farms in the Czech Republic. In Russia, they are found in transition zones between taiga forest and open steppe (often around river valleys), in pine forests, near dwarf forests, in wet, wooded areas of the steppe, and in forested swamps. In Kazakhstan, riparian forests in lowland steppes and forest-steppes mosaics are their primary habitat.

In winter, much like during breeding, they usually occur in wetter habitats than most other eagles, including forested river deltas, mangrove forests, marshes, lakeshores, and, in India especially, jheels. However, greater spotted eagles have also been documented in semi-arid &quot;Acacia&quot; savannas in northeastern Africa. Reportedly in Eritrea, they occur in open moorland, around villages, and lowland grasslands, while in Sudan they are usually in shrubby areas. One seen wintering in Ankara, Turkey, was in an upland forest area. In the Mediterranean Basin, a study found that the preferred habitats of wintering greater spotted eagles were salt marshes and coastal lagoons with freshwater areas. They are not uncommon in paddy fields and sometimes garbage dumps in Asia during winter, being much more adaptable to human-modified areas in this season, though by and large prefer assorted wetlands, mudflats, large rivers, estuaries, and mangroves. In Arabia, they are largely found now in manmade habitats—such as sewage farms, reservoirs, and agricultural land—since the native mangrove and &quot;Phragmites&quot; reed-beds that once lined the coastal bays have been almost entirely eliminated. In southern Iran, they are usually found in mangrove areas. A key habitat in Iraq is the Mesopotamian Marshes. Wintering habitats in Israel are the wettest available valleys and damp open zones, chiefly cultivated fields and fishponds near patches of trees, with similar habitats used in Oman.

Greater spotted eagles are typically found from sea level to and are characteristically a lowland bird. However, they have been recorded at elevations up to in northern Iran. One greater spotted eagle was recorded on migration at in Ladakh in the Himalayas.

==Migration==
Greater spotted eagles are almost entirely migratory birds. However, they are not considered long-distance migrants compared to other birds of prey. They migrate between late August to October, occasionally lasting into November. The return flight typically starts in early February, peaking in March and ending in April. However, migration has been documented well into May, near the Bosphorus in Turkey. On average, migration peaks earlier in the eastern end of their range, such as in Bhutan, where the largest numbers are seen in late February. They migrate around two weeks later than lesser spotted eagles and return earlier than that species as well. At known migration stopovers, lesser spotted eagles almost always outnumber greater spotted eagles.

Greater spotted eagles who breed in Europe may migrate to southern France (especially Camargue), Spain, Italy, and sometimes Sweden. Western breeding birds also regularly end up in North Africa, with a few in Morocco, Egypt, the Nile Valley, Sudan, Ethiopia, and occasionally points further south. Birds from various origin sites may end up in the Middle East (mainly Arabia), South Asia (from Pakistan, most often Punjab and Sind, northern India, and Nepal), east to Indochina, the Malay Peninsula, and southern and eastern China. Greater spotted eagles on an Eastern European track predominantly migrate to the Middle East or Northeast Africa, while others migrate through the Carpathian Mountains to the Balkan Peninsula, and some continue through Central Europe and Western Europe to Southwestern Europe. The main wintering sites of the Asian populations are located in the Arabian Peninsula, Indian subcontinent, Indochina Peninsula, and East China.

During migration, greater spotted eagles commonly cover around per day but can cover up to within a day. The flight speeds of migrating eagles of the species was documented as in the Baikal region, with peak movements times from noon to 6:00 PM.

There is limited information on discrepancies in how different ages and sexes migrate. Fewer numbers are generally recorded in spring migration compared to autumn migration. Generally, migrants of the species move on broad fronts in singles or pairs, but groups as large as 10 have been seen northbound over Bhutan in late February. In Malaysia, immatures outnumbered adults six to one. At Lake Baikal, 96% of migrating greater spotted eagles were observed to be adults, an imbalance that concerned researchers. Greater spotted eagles tend to be scarce at traditional migratory bottlenecks such as Bosphorus and the straits of the Red Sea. Old claims of as many as a thousand migrating eagles in the fall at Bosphorus are possibly erroneous (although there has possibly been a reduction of up to 75% from historic peak migrating numbers). In South Baikal in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia, greater spotted eagles accounted for only 0.2% of the observed migrating raptors in autumn migration (7–34 individuals annually; 137 individuals over 8 years). The largest (modern?) counts were 86 and 74 at Suez, Egypt, in autumn and spring, respectively, with smaller numbers recorded crossing into Africa at Bab-el-Mandeb, although a maximum of 85 has been recorded in northern Israel in autumn.

An adult captured near Mecca in western Saudi Arabia in late October was radiotracked to Yemen, where it remained from late November until early February, before returning via southern Iraq, across the Iranian highlands, skirting the south edge of the Aral Sea, and finally flying to its Siberian breeding area near Omsk, covering of the return journey in less than a month. Satellite tracking of an eagle breeding in Estonia confirmed it consistently used the same wintering ground in coastal Catalonia, Spain, over seven consecutive years. Despite some individual devotedness to wintering grounds, one radiotracked individual initially trapped in the United Arab Emirates was found the following winter to go instead to Pakistan from its Kazakh breeding grounds, showing some variability in this regard.

A wintering greater spotted eagle in southwest Saudi Arabia (from a Western Siberia breeding area) was found to utilize an average home range in winter of , which contracted 24% before it migrated in the spring, taking from late February to late April to migrate over . Wintertime territory in Spain was found to be smaller, at . 

The southernmost migration record of a greater spotted eagle was one that traveled from the Biebrza National Park in Poland to Zambia in southern Africa. Several other purportedly greater spotted eagles were tracked to several areas of Africa, but nearly half were actually hybrids with lesser spotted eagles and were migrating in more typical fashion and location to that species.

Improbably, at least seven records show immature greater spotted eagles staying through the summer in Saudi Arabia. Similarly, records show lingering numbers of this species into at least May in Peninsular Malaysia.

==Dietary biology==

The greater spotted eagle is a slightly opportunistic predator but tends to favor rather particular prey types. Their diet tends to be composed mostly of small mammals. Despite some dietary similarities with the lesser spotted eagle, the greater spotted eagle&#x27;s diet includes more birds and favors larger prey. Beyond mammals and birds, the greater spotted eagle will sometimes prey on amphibians, reptiles (mainly small-to-mid-sized snakes), and occasionally small fish and insects. Pellets are considered the most reliable way to determine the diets of greater spotted eagle, as prey remains alone can be biased towards birds.

As can be expected by their habitat preferences, greater spotted eagles tend to eat vertebrates associated with water. Generally, its prey spectrum is somewhat diverse, at slightly fewer than 150 known prey species; this is more diverse than the known diet of the steppe eagle, similar in diversity to that of the lesser spotted eagle, and possibly about half as diverse of the diet of the eastern imperial eagle.

Greater spotted eagles hunt mainly on the wing, quartering over relatively open ground (somewhat like a harrier) or soaring high above and dropping or diving steeply when prey is spotted. Brown and Amadon describe the hunting greater spotted eagle, saying: &quot;Although not a very active species it is not exactly sluggish, and on the wing it has the look of a true eagle.&quot; Greater spotted eagles will scatter waterfowl by stooping low over their flock, then selecting isolated individuals to attack. Sometimes the greater spotted eagle still-hunts from a perch, a method more commonly employed by other eagles of similar distribution, and often hunts on foot as well. It mostly takes prey on ground or water. The species also sometime carries out kleptoparasitic attacks on other birds of prey. Although scavenging for carrion seems to occur almost aseasonally, it is likely more prevalent during non-breeding times, when the eagles mostly bring fresh prey to their nests. Along with other predators such as steppe eagles, greater spotted eagles are often attracted to grass fires and swarming locusts during non-breeding times.

During the breeding season in Biebrza National Park in Poland, hunting behaviours were studied. It was found that the peak flying and hunting times were 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with the eagles rarely flying before 9:00 AM and often in repose from 2:00 to 4:00 PM. Prey deliveries by the male (the main food provider) may have been more varied than later in the season when the female resumed hunting. In Biebrza, hunting territories were defended from conspecifics, lesser spotted eagles, and other large birds of prey. Per the Biebrza data, the hunting success was 34% for the male up to mid-July, after which success declined to 20%. The hunting success rates of greater spotted eagles seem rather high—the aforementioned 34% for much of the breeding season is much higher than the hunting success rates of golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) (around 20%), lesser spotted eagles (24%), and Bonelli&#x27;s eagles (&quot;Aquila fasciata&quot;) (28.5%) at comparable times.

It is sometimes stated that they tend to take prey mostly up to only . One source estimated that around 22% of prey constituting their diet weighs or less, 37% weighs , and around 30% weighs , and that generally most prey weighs under . Based on this source, the mean estimated prey size for the greater spotted eagle may fall around approximately .

A large study from Belarus found that the diets of greater spotted eagles were predominantly composed of prey with body masses of (41.9%) and (38.3%). However, the greatest contributor to total prey biomass was from prey weighing (34%). In this study, the mean estimated size of prey deliveries by males was . In contrast, an Estonian study gave an estimate of merely . The mean prey sizes are roughly similar to those of larger steppe eagles and somewhat higher than those of lesser spotted eagles, which tend to focus on prey weighing under (around 60% of diet); however, the typical prey of most &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles tended to be slightly higher (eastern imperial eagle) to considerably higher (golden eagle) in weight than the typical prey of greater spotted eagles. Still, sometimes the greater spotted eagle is credited with successful attacks on large prey.

In the largest known food study of greater spotted eagles, the species&#x27; diet was studied in three different habitats in Belarusian Polesia, from natural to mixed to modified habitats. 797 prey items were identified in total (but often not to species), and was composed of mammals (40.4%), birds (36.0%), invertebrates (15.8%, mostly beetles), reptiles (5.7%), amphibians (1.3%), and fish (0.9%). Assorted &quot;Microtus&quot; voles were an important food source—namely the common vole, tundra vole, and East European voles—making up collectively 23.4% of the diet by number. Other significant prey were the European water vole (8.9%), common snipe (4.1%), mallard (3.3%), water rail (3.1%), unidentified small passerines (2.9%), spotted crakes (2.6%), and grass snakes (2.3%). Significant in biomass but less so in numbers were the northern white-breasted hedgehog, European mole, &quot;Anas&quot; dabbling ducks, grey herons, Eurasian bitterns, and black grouse, with small numbers of very large birds being taken.

In another study, of 102 prey items recorded in Smolenskoye Poozerye National Park in Belarus, the most common were European water voles (38.2%), European moles (7.8%); 5.9% each &quot;Sorex&quot; shrews, &quot;Microtus&quot; voles, and unidentified passerine species; and common frogs (8.7%). At a nest in Estonia, of 105 visually identified prey items, &quot;Microtus&quot; species and further unidentified rodents comprised some 63% by number but only 28% by biomass, while birds formed only 19% by number but 56% by biomass; 45% of avian prey species were medium-sized, such as hazel grouse, grey partridge, northern lapwing, and hooded crow.

Other European studies have been largely confined to wintering greater spotted eagles. In the Amvrakikos Wetlands of Greece, 95 prey items were determined, being composed almost exclusively of water birds. The main prey here were common teal (17.9% by number, 15.9% by biomass), common moorhen (16.8%, 14.9%), Eurasian wigeon (11.6%, 27.4%), unidentified &quot;Anas&quot; ducks (5.3%, 7.8%), Eurasian coot (4.2%, 8.7%), and little egret (3.2%, 4.7%), with a small contribution by ground beetles, passerines, and snakes.

Over 8 years of study in Natural Park of El Fondo in the Spanish province of Alicante, almost entirely large prey was taken, with few to no small rodents (such as voles). Among the 100 prey items found, the main prey were common moorhen (23.1% by number, 15.2% in biomass), common teal (8.97%, 6.44%), black rat (7.69%, 3.01%), and unidentified &quot;Rattus&quot; (7.69%, 2.76%). Other notable regular prey were black-headed gull, Eurasian coots, and northern lapwing. Large prey, which made up much of the biomass, were common carp (18.9% of biomass), grey heron (11.7%), and European rabbit (9%).

At nests in Western Russia, a mean total of 53% of the diet was found to be small mammals and 45% was birds. In a study in the Leningrad region, the eagle&#x27;s diet of 79 prey items was led by European water vole (51%), followed by introduced muskrats (3.9%) and common teal (3.8%), as well as frogs (20.2%), most probably common frogs and some moor frogs.

322 non-carrion prey items were found for greater spotted eagles in the Belaya River, 59% of which were mammals. The diet was largely European water vole at 32.6%, followed by smaller voles and mice. It was found that the Belaya eagles ate a large balances of reptile prey (19.5%)—in fact, 15% of all vertebrate prey were European adders. The eagles took average sized snakes but were not seen to prey on small snakes, nor to take many particularly large snakes; they were often seen grasping snakes about the head. In Belaya, only 6.5% of the diet was birds, mainly significant only in the Oka Nature Reserve. The eagles of the region also occasionally partook in carrion feeding, including moose carcasses.

In a compilation study from the Volga region, Ural Mountains, and Western Siberia, 74.7% of the eagle&#x27;s diet was mammalian, of 482 prey items. Its main prey species was the European water vole at an average of 32.4% of diet (28.1–36.8%), followed by common vole averaging 11.4% (0–17%), tundra vole at 6.2% (1.9–16.9%), and birds at 16%, most importantly Eurasian coots and &quot;Podiceps&quot; grebes followed by rooks. In the Tyva Republic, more terrestrial, upland hunting can be projected since the Daurian pika was reportedly the main prey for greater spotted eagles. Similarly, in Khakassia, the greater spotted eagle was said to hunt mostly the long-tailed ground squirrel, the only known part of the eagles&#x27; breeding areas where ground squirrels were said to be preferred over voles.

Their diet is generally more erratically known in non-European wintering areas. Like many other raptors of similar region, migrating greater spotted eagles typically fast until they reach their wintering terminus point. The most well-studied Asian wintering population of the species in terms of dietary behaviour is likely in Bharatpur, India, particularly in Keoladeo National Park. It was found that greater spotted eagles here occupied a greater range of habitat than other spotted and &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles. Here, greater spotted eagles are non-territorial and free ranging, and are recorded to exploit the full length of the local marshland. Winter numbers are up to 30 for this species, with their numbers peaking in November and December and then diminishing after January. Like most other wintering migrant raptors here, like milvine kites, the greater spotted eagle becomes a highly opportunistic feeder that shows a preference for easily attainable foods. They regularly come down to carrion, pirate food from other birds, feed on stranded fish, and, perhaps most regularly, hunt and take young herons, storks, and other water birds from heronries. When doing so, the greater spotted eagles often approach in a hover to disrupt the heronry and then, as the heronry settles, suddenly drop onto a targeted nest, defeather the squab (nestling water bird) in the nest, and commence feeding. The Bharatpur greater spotted eagles show a slight preference for slow-moving prey, but also take fast flying birds like waders and ducks. An eagle will test a flock of coots by flying low over the water, continually &quot;buzzing&quot; the birds, until it can attack an isolated individual. Often, they perch extensively on favorite lookout posts, with gum arabic trees favored in Bharatpur. Though they typically hunt by day, some possible nighttime hunting has been inferred for greater spotted eagles in Bharatpur. During inclement weather in Bharatpur, the eagles may pause hunting. As many as 7–10 greater spotted eagles are attracted by a conspecific’s heronry kill and subsequently often jostle each other. Often this results in the eagle accidentally dropping the kill into the water, though those dropped onto dry ground frequently become food for wild boars and golden jackals. In one case, two adult greater spotted eagles and a single immature eastern imperial eagle destroyed at least 30 water bird nests in a single day. Out of 79 hours of observation on greater spotted eagles, they spent 49% of the time foraging, increasing to 72% by March due to scarcer foods. Meanwhile, they spent 26.4% of the time resting and 20.6% soaring, with soaring rising to 35% in February. The greater spotted eagles consumed a daily mean of per day, with most foods nourishing them over several days. They reportedly hunted the most diverse prey range of any raptor of the region.

In the Indian subcontinent as a whole, greater spotted eagles are known to freely scavenge carrion, as well as feed on frogs (especially Indus valley bullfrogs), chameleons, &quot;Calotes&quot; lizards, snakes, rodents, and small mammals. A general aptitude in the region has been reported for avian prey—largely larger rails such as moorhens, Eurasian coots and gray-headed swamphens—as well as waterfowl and (mostly young) storks, herons and egrets; however, upland birds such as rufous treepies, Eurasian collared doves, and Indian rollers also seem to be included. Though rare at large carrion, greater spotted eagles in the Indian subcontinent seem to be attracted to terrapins maimed or partially eaten by Pallas&#x27;s fish eagles, Egyptian vultures, and red-headed vultures.

Anecdotal evidence of the diet of wintering greater spotted eagles was attained in the central plains of Thailand. Here they were seen to eat dead fish in drained ponds as well as to actively hunt and to pirate food from other raptors. They were seen to prey on domestic ducks that became separated from their large farm flocks, as well as to feed on dead lesser whistling ducks found to be killed by poisons meant to kill snails. One farther prey species reported to be likely highly important to this region’s greater spotted eagles is the ricefield rat. Despite not being considered to show an aptitude for attacking large or varied prey, sometimes greater spotted eagles seem to be capable of taking very varied and sometimes substantially sized prey.

It has been detected that small invertebrates may be taken at times, including ground beetles, locusts, and non-native red swamp crayfish. The greater spotted eagle takes a range of birds, ranging down to the size of the common reed bunting. They can take fairly large water birds up to the size of adult great egrets, grey herons, mallards, and fledgling storks such as painted storks and Asian openbills. Sometimes the greater spotted eagle will attack or scavenge on cranes, though many attempted attacks are reportedly unsuccessful. Scavenging on common crane (&quot;Grus grus&quot;) carcass and failed predation attempt on adult demoiselle crane (&quot;Grus virgo&quot;) have been reported. the eagles were also considered a potential threat to the young of red-crowned cranes(&quot;Grus japonensis&quot;), which are known to furiously defend their chicks.

Outside of avian prey, mammals have been taken ranging from Eurasian harvest mouse and common shrew, weighing no more than , up to the European hare, potentially weighing up to . Sometimes greater spotted eagles may prey upon around a half dozen species of mustelids, mostly assorted weasels and stoats but also including larger species such as minks and martens.

===Interspecific predatory relationships===

Greater spotted eagles often overlap broadly with a number of similar eagle species in both its breeding and wintering regions. In the larger portion of its breeding range, the greater spotted eagle is allopatric from the lesser spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga pomarina&quot;). Where they do overlap, they share a somewhat similar diet, but the greater spotted eagle tends to focus on water-friendly species and to take relatively more birds, whereas the lesser spotted eagle often focuses on voles, small snakes (such as grass snakes), and frogs. As such, the lesser spotted eagle tends to nest in slightly drier environments, usually somewhat away from wetlands and floodplains, adapting rather more readily to patchwork areas where human development has occurred. More similar in central distribution are larger eagles such as the eastern imperial eagle (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;) and steppe eagle (&quot;Aquila nipalensis&quot;). 

Furthermore, these species undertake roughly similar migratory routes, though the steppe eagle is the most populous and regular migrant (in spite of its extreme decline), appearing in numbers from Africa to South Asia, while the greater spotted and eastern imperial eagles appear regularly as far west as the Middle East and scarcely in Africa. However, the greater spotted eagle is clearly partitioned from the other eagles by its favoring of wet and partially wooded habitats and the prey found therein. The eastern imperial eagle also nests in woods, but usually in upland areas, and favors both social and solitary terrestrial mammals and birds, including hares, hamsters, ground squirrels, and hedgehogs as well as pheasants, corvids, and other mid-sized birds. Meanwhile, the steppe eagle favours typically rather dry and very open habitats in the steppe, usually nesting on a rise or outcrop in the flat, sparse habitat, and much favours ground squirrels, supplemented by other small terrestrial species such as pikas, voles, and zokors. Habitat usually keeps these eagles separated from the greater spotted eagle while nesting; however, in winter quarters such as India, the Mediterranean Basin, and the Middle East, considerable convergence does occur. 

All three eagles are well-established to be rather unpicky opportunists and scavengers during winter. They freely come to human refuse (favoring livestock carcass dumps), scavenge unclaimed carrion, rob other birds of prey of their catches, kill the young of prey such as water birds, find insect swarms or emergences (the steppe eagle more so than the others), and follow grass fires. Of these three, the steppe eagle tends to be least actively predatory in winter, the eastern imperial eagle tends to be the most likely to continue to live-hunt (and perch most extensively), and the greater spotted eagle somewhere in the intermediate behavioral zone. The greater spotted is the least likely of the three to visit carrion or carcass dumps; but, on the Indian subcontinent, they all heavily share food sources such as nestling water birds. When conflicts arise, the body size of an eagle imparts its position in the hierarchy—the eastern imperial eagle is dominant, followed by the steppe eagle, while the greater spotted eagle is somewhat subservient to both. The three eagles were well studied in Bharatpur, where they competed against the shorter-distance migrant, the Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle, which vied with the imperial eagles for the dominant raptor position while all the larger eagles dominated the smaller, resident Indian spotted eagles. The black kite, a non-eagle raptor often associated with wintering greater spotted eagles, is attracted to similar feeding opportunities.

While scavenging, greater spotted eagles tend not to come to carrion if Old World vultures are present. Greater spotted eagles are accomplished pirates during the winter season. They often rob a variety of other raptors including black kites, ospreys, western and eastern marsh harriers, and even other eagles, including larger species like white-bellied sea eagles and steppe eagles. Despite their typically inferior position to them, the greater spotted eagle was observed in Bharatpur to often successfully displace the steppe eagle from disputed food, with the steppe eagle being more tractable when gorged. They tend to rob other raptors aerially during their victim&#x27;s takeoff with prey, exploiting the other bird’s attempt to balance itself, during which they yank away the prey and rapidly escape. 

More infrequently, greater spotted eagles will target other raptors as prey, including black kites, booted eagles, western marsh harriers, and common buzzards, as well as some owls, like long-eared and short-eared owls. Additionally, they are considered a potential predator of small nestlings of the Eurasian griffon vulture.

Greater spotted eagles themselves have few well-documented predators. While this is probably due in part to scant research, as a quite large and powerful bird of prey, they usually fulfill the role of apex predator. Still, predators of greater spotted eagles include Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl, white-tailed eagle, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl. Furthermore, European pine martens are known to feed on nestlings of greater spotted eagles.

==Breeding==
Greater spotted eagles often occur in pairs or solitary, but in winter sometimes occur in small to large flocks, especially around attractive food sources. The species is often seen singly during migration, though sometimes in twos or threes or more.

This species breeds from late April to August in much of its range. However, when breeding in Pakistan and the Indian subcontinent, they may do so in different reports from November to March, sometimes further into June to July, indicating an inconsistent nesting schedule there. 

The display of this eagle is not well-known but includes single or mutual high circling, soaring high with the male diving down on half-closed wings towards the female, all with much calling. Territories can be from in ideal regions, usually within the confines of a protected area, though are much larger elsewhere. 

In the past, greater spotted eagle nests have been reportedly found as close as from each other; in one case, four pairs nested in an area of merely . A more typical range may be in the zone of . The density of greater spotted eagles was 4.76 (per confirmed numbers) to 6.15 (per projections based on available habitat) breeding pairs per of forested area in the Volga–Ural region, while in the Western Siberia region it was 6.55–8.76 breeding pairs per . The highest density was in the Volga–Ural area, with up to 3.58–17.01 pairs where the locally preferred habitat (flooded alders) was available. The mean distance between nests in the Volga–Ural area was . In the Ishim River basin of Kazakhstan, there was 0.54 pairs per . In the Kazakh Irtysh pine forests, there was 1.08 pairs per in internal forest edges, and a much higher density of 13.23 pairs per in forest edges along lakes and bogs in the Irtysh basin. 

The highest density of pairs in Kazakhstan is possibly the region of the Ishim River, holding perhaps 39% of the nation’s breeding pairs. Furthermore, in well-suited Russian habitats, nests were said (at least historically) to be found every of riverside, with fairly consistent pair reuse in following years.

===Nests===
The species builds a large stick nest which may measure across and up to deep. Nests appear significantly smaller in the Indian subcontinent, at around across—shorter than the eagle’s own total length—and merely deep. 

Unusually, these eagles tend to build nests using fresh branches with foliage or green conifer needles still attached (most other acciptrids prefer sparse or leafless branches while building nests). Nests are lined with green leaves, needles, and grass, as is common in accipitrids, and they may be added to continuously throughout the breeding cycle. The nest is normally located in a tree, usually in the main fork, a large lateral branch, or the top of large broadleaf trees just inside forests. 

Russian compilation studies found that about 68.7% of observed greater spotted eagle nests were on deciduous trees, with the remaining in coniferous trees. In the Russian Nizhny Novgorod region, 10 out of 11 observed nests were located on birches and one on a black alder. In Poland, birch (such as downy birch) appear popular in use. In the Volga–Ural area, alder forests were preferred, with 71.4% of pairs with found active nests using it, while in Western Siberia they preferred pine forests (55.9%). Within the Altai-Sayan region, preferred nest trees were birch (50%) and larch trees (31.25%). Gum arabic trees and mango trees were reportedly used in Pakistan, and &quot;Mitragyna parvifolia&quot; in India, and were reportedly sometimes even on agricultural land. 

Russian studies found that nests were almost invariably in floodplain forests. The nest can be above the ground or water, though usually . Nesting sites in the Volga–Ural area averaged from the nearest forest edge, but were often in the densest part of the forest stands. From a sample of 83 nests in the Volga–Ural area, the average nest height was . In Nizhny Novgorod, nest heights were above the ground. In Western Siberia, nest height ranged from with an average of , with nest sites appearing lower in the more conifer-based Western Siberia area. Nest heights were lower still in the Altai-Sayan region, averaging . 

Rarely, nests are recorded in shrubs in treeless regions. A nest in Altai-Sayan was reportedly only above the ground. Even more rarely, nests have been reportedly located on the ground. At times, they may use the nests of other birds—most likely other birds of prey, but even a Eurasian magpie nest was reportedly once used.

===Development of young===

In Russia, greater spotted eagles reportedly seldom lay eggs until May, but sometimes as early as late April, with similar (if mildly earlier) laying times farther west. The clutch size is typically two, though sometimes the nest contains one to three eggs. Eggs are broad, grayish-white ovoids, and tend to be glossless and often unmarked. However, sometimes they may manifest a few dark brown spots or blotches and sparse grey shell-marks. The eggs may range in height from , and in diameter from . 

The incubation stage lasts 42–44 days per most sources, but in southern Belarus, an incubation stage of only 39 days was documented. Incubation begins with the first egg. The male of the pair was once thought to not take part in incubation (typically, as in many raptors, they primarily have the responsibility of prey deliveries). However, in the aforementioned Belarusian study, the male incubated an average of 57.3 minutes during daylight. 

In the Altai taiga region, among six greater spotted eagle territories, the average brood size was 1.33 nestling per successful nest or 1.0 nestling per occupied nest. Two of the Altai greater spotted eagle territories were on the abandoned territories of eastern imperial eagles. Meanwhile, in the Volga–Ural and Western Siberia areas, the mean brood sizes were 1.24 and 1.42, respectively. 

The body size between greater spotted eagle nestlings differs markedly when the second eaglet hatches and the younger usually dies, often via siblicide. Competition often resulting in starvation or intentional killing of the younger chick by its elder sibling is not uncommon in birds of prey, especially the eagles, and is often hypothesized as a kind of insurance process wherein the younger sibling acts an insurance if the elder sibling is somehow killed; otherwise, the younger sibling (which is not necessarily in ill health) is possibly expected to die. However, this species raises two fledglings at least somewhat more commonly than the lesser spotted eagle. Out of 50 nests in the Oka Nature Reserve, though, only one pair managed to produce two fledglings in a year. 

In an experiment in a nest in Poland, a younger sibling was taken out of the nest to save it. At the time, the younger eaglet weighed and the older sibling weighed . After being taken out of the nest, the younger eaglet was raised with minimal interactions, to avoid imprinting, beyond feeding in captivity by humans. The eaglet shared a cage with an eastern imperial eagle and a lesser spotted eagle, both of which were indifferent towards it, and did not in any way care for or feed it. At the point of fledging, the eaglet was successfully reintroduced to its own parent&#x27;s nest, fledged, and attained independence. 

A mother greater spotted eagle can be a somewhat tight sitter, but when disturbed by activity can abandon the nest for a full day before returning. By late July to early August, the young are fully feathered, and within five days thereafter take their first flight. Fledging occurs at 60–67 days, averaging close to 62 days. In the Altai-Sayan region, the mean number of fledglings per successful nest could vary from an average of 1 per nest in Tuva to 1.8 in Khakassia. In Kazakh studies, an average of 1.38 fledglings were produced in 11 nests. In Western Siberia, an average of 1.44 fledglings were produced in 66 broods. 

Dependence on the parents lasts 30 days more after fledging. Before dispersing, young greater spotted eagles may wander locally into the open steppe. Female greater spotted eagles were found to leave 2–3 days before their young in a study in Poland. Meanwhile, the male tends to leave last, at about 1 week after the female. In the Polish study, adults headed straight for Bosphorus while juveniles were sometimes less direct. Most were gone from Poland by the end of September. Juveniles were seen to wander elsewhere in Poland during autumn before finally migrating.

===Hybridization===
At one time, greater and lesser spotted eagles may have been largely isolated from each other via different (though potentially proximal) habitats. Climate changes at the conclusion of the last ice age (at some point early in the Holocene) permitted forest growth where there were once grassy boundaries, allowing the two species of spotted eagles to expand into each other’s ranges. Hybridization is now known to occur extensively. Hybrids occurs in the entire overlapping range of the two species, which is some . Interbreeding is mostly determined via conjecture in European Russia, which is roughly the eastern limit of the lesser spotted eagle’s range and thus where hybridization possibly occurred most recently. 

Hybrids between the two species often show a nape patch (absent in pure greater spotted eagles), an intermediate amount of spotting about the wings, and typically a larger body size than pure lesser spotted eagles. Despite their intermediate characteristics and larger size than lesser spotteds, the hybridization of the species is thought to be an indication of the abandonment of greater spotted eagle territories and the replacement of them by the more adaptive and populous lesser spotted eagles, as was indicated in an Estonian study. The Estonian study found that the number of pairs of hybrids in the nation was twice that of pure greater spotted eagles. The situation was even graver in Lithuania, where not a single pure pair of greater spotted eagles could be found any longer by the mid-2000s, with only 2.7% of 161 breeding spotted eagles being greater spotteds, the rest being lesser spotteds. Lesser spotted eagles were estimated to number around 1,000 breeding pairs in Lithuania, with an estimated 37 or so of these containing one mate that was a greater spotted eagle. 

Both Polish and Estonian studies reflected a probable high turnover of mates in hybrid pairs, with the Polish data finding about 71% of the males of the pairs being supplemented in subsequent years. Furthermore, the Polish data indicated that the hybrids favoured the habitats of lesser spotted eagles, farther away from the wetter habitats of the greater spotted eagle and often nearer human development, with a local 50% reduction of pure greater spotted eagle pairs and 30% increase in hybrid pairs. 

Habitat alterations to the environment by humans are thought in general to be partially beneficial to lesser spotted eagles and normally harmful to greater spotted eagles.

==Status and conservation==

Despite maintaining a fairly vast breeding range—covering at least 9 million square kilometres in a band from the Baltic Sea in Europe eastward to the Pacific Ocean with minor outposts in the Indian subcontinent—this eagle occurs at extremely low densities. In essentially every nation of its distribution, the greater spotted eagle is classified as vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN. 

Populations and trends of the species have been considered rather poorly studied in the past, but a strong declining trend has been detected. Rough estimates in the 1990s indicated 11 pairs in a huge area of around in northeastern Poland, and only 20–30 pairs in an area of in European Russia, with no more than 900 pairs west of the Urals. More refined subsequent efforts put the number of breeding pairs in the European Union at 810–1,100 breeding pairs. 

Furthermore, in the 1990s, it was extrapolated from Indian wintering populations that the more eastern population is surely less than four figures. Birdlife International in the 1990s estimated the Russian population at 2,800–3,000 pairs. More recently, Birdlife has estimated the global population as no more than 3,800–13,200 total mature individuals worldwide. 

A color-banding recovery study determined that of 1,370 European banded recoveries of spotted eagles, only 3.6% were greater spotted eagles, while hybrids of lesser and greater spotteds comprised 2.7%, and the remaining were all lesser spotted eagles. Greater spotted eagles are considered extripated as a breeding species from Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic (where they may have never consistently bred), and Slovakia, as well as Israel where they last bred in the 1960s. Meanwhile, the Finland breeding population is also likely almost gone. 

Steady reduction in Ukraine down to 40–50 pairs by 1985, and a 12–20% overall reduction of the Ukrainian population from the 1920s to 1990s, was estimated. The number of greater spotted eagles in Estonia declined 14% merely from 2004 to 2010, with declines having been detected for some time there. Belarus has as many as 150–200 breeding pairs (with confirmed counts of somewhat over 100) and is considered the most important breeding area known outside of Russia.

Whereas the total numbers in European Russia were once estimated at around 1,000 breeding pairs in the 1960s, there are estimated to be fewer than 700 pairs remaining there. The species&#x27; range has shrunk in the Russian Far East, where it was once widely found but is now restricted to below the middle Amur river, along the Ussuri river, and south Primorsky Krai, although anecdotal information suggests that it is still somewhat common in the whole Western Siberian lowlands from the Ural Mountains to the middle Ob River. In Kazakhstan, there are an estimated 74–97 breeding pairs of the species. 

Wintering estimates are more scattered and efforts to tabulate numbers in India show they continue to occur quite broadly, but in perhaps slightly lowered and more scattered numbers. In Armenia, it is considered one of the two rarest of the nation’s 30 raptor species, along with the eastern imperial eagle. Wintering numbers of greater spotted eagles in the Mediterranean Basin were found to total about 300–400 individuals, with a bit under 34% of these in Israel, just under 32% in Greece, 16% in Turkey, somewhat smaller numbers in Romania and Spain, and tiny numbers in Southeastern Europe, Montenegro, and France. Around 50 individuals winter in Turkey per other sources. The species appears fairly rarely in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where they are seen singly and sparsely in most cases.
===Threats and conservation efforts===

The species&#x27; primary threats are habitat degradation and habitat loss. Greater spotted eagles appear to be highly sensitive to habitat alterations, especially drainage of wetlands, intensified agricultural practices, and abandonment of floodplain management practices. 

Detrimental wetland management processes have additionally affected the species on their wintering grounds, where in Saudi Arabia at least, the effect has been offset by the species adapting to man-made bodies of water (unlike in winter, though, there is no evidence that they adapt well to man-made areas during breeding). The amount of usable manmade habitat has shrunk in Thailand with a change to dry season rice field cropping and the creeping presence of urbanization, along with probable rodenticide usage and other poisonings, likely harming the number of the species able to winter there. 

Other known threats include human disturbance during the mating season, with forestry operations now known to be a major cause of disturbance at the nest site. Furthermore, greater spotted eagles are threatened by mostly inadvertent poisonings and collisions with man-made objects, especially electrical wires. Poisonings were known to be a serious cause of mortality in a Shanxi reserve in China, where the eagles were seen to hunt down sickly or dying common pheasants that had been poisoned and then subsequently dying themselves, this becoming the primary local source of mortality. 

In the Malay Peninsula, subsequent to a brief increase of the species from the 1960s to the 1980s due to environmental changes favorable to avian scavengers, a crash in numbers down to almost none was thought to be quite likely due to pesticide and other poison usage. The real trends of greater spotted eagles are sometimes masked by misidentifications. 

Furthermore, as aforementioned, the species is at threat of hybridization and ultimate supplantation by the lesser spotted eagle as its range creeps farther east. The greater spotted eagle is legally protected in only scattered nations, making conservation efforts difficult. Among the nations where they are legally protected are Belarus, Estonia, France, Greece, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Russia, and nominally in Thailand. A working group specifically to address spotted eagles has been established as of the 21st century. The working groups have managed to undertake conservation efforts in Belarus, Estonia, and Ukraine—the core breeding areas left in Europe for the species—and have successfully instituted restrictions on forestry activities near nesting sites during the breeding season. Conservation activities have been also led within projects funded by EU LIFE programme. From 2010 to 2014 a project titled &quot;Securing the population of &quot;Aquila clanga&quot; in Poland: preparation of the National Action Plan and primary site conservation&quot; focused on Polish population. An international project under the title &quot;Above the borders: conservation of Greater Spotted Eagles at breeding and wintering areas, and on its flyway&quot; has been established to improve conditions at the breeding sites and increase the abundance of the greater spotted eagle. 

The building of artificial nest platforms did not seem to greatly aid greater spotted eagles in Nizhny Novgorod—unlike other raptors such as the osprey, the white-tailed eagle, and the golden eagle—as only one pair of greater spotted eagles were recorded to use a platform as a nest. In an exceptional positive note, it was found the European population of greater spotted eagle, as studied via microsatellites, retains quite high genetic diversity, meaning that there is no eminent threat of a genetic bottleneck for the species.

<text>The term punch refers to a wide assortment of drinks, both non-alcoholic and alcoholic, generally containing fruits or fruit juice. The drink was introduced from the Indian subcontinent to England by employees of the East India Company in the late 17th century. Punch is usually served at parties in large, wide bowls, known as &quot;punch bowls&quot;.

In the United States, federal regulations provide the word &quot;punch&quot; to describe commercial beverage products that do &quot;not&quot; contain fruit or fruit juice. The term is used to label artificially flavored beverages, with or without natural flavorings, which do not contain fruit juice or concentrate in significant proportions. Thus a product labeled as &quot;fruit punch&quot; may contain no fruit ingredients at all.

== Etymology==

The word is commonly said to come from from Hindi पाँच (&quot;pāñch&quot;), meaning &quot;five&quot;, as the drink was frequently made with five ingredients: alcohol, sugar, juice from either a lime or a lemon, water, and spices, or milk, curd, butter, honey, sugar. That etymology traces to John Fryer&#x27;s &quot;A New Account of East India and Persia, in Eight Letters&quot; (1698), but there is no evidence of a drink called pāñch in India, or elsewhere, before the English word. Besides, the English word is now known to have been in use before the British became regulars to India.

Some believe the word originates from the English &quot;puncheon&quot;, which was a volumetric description for certain sized barrels used to transport alcohol on ships.
== History ==
The drink was introduced from the Indian subcontinent to England by employees of the East India Company in the late 17th century. From there it was introduced into other European countries. When served communally, the drink is expected to be of a lower alcohol content than a typical cocktail.

The term &quot;punch&quot; was first recorded in English documents in 1632. At the time, most punches were of the wassail type made with a wine or brandy base. But around 1655, Jamaican-produced rum came into use, and the &quot;modern&quot; punch emerged. By 1671, documents make references to punch houses.

As the need for a single-serving punch became evident, the sling, composed of spirits, water, and a sweetener, was invented.

== Variations ==

=== Non-alcoholic ===

Non-alcoholic varieties, which are especially given to children, as well as adults who do not drink alcohol, typically include a mix of fruit juice, water, and a sweetener, such as sugar or honey. Lemon-lime soda, ginger ale, or other fruit-flavored carbonated sodas are often added. It also often contains slices or chunks of actual fruit, such as oranges and pineapple. The non-alcoholic versions are typically served at school dances, church functions, picnics, and other similar social occasions.

Commercial manufacturers distribute many types of &quot;fruit punch&quot; beverages. These are usually colored red. Despite the name, most brands contain only a small fraction of actual fruit juice; the major constituents are typically sugar or corn syrup, citric acid, and artificial flavors. They may also be carbonated or nonalcoholic cocktail mixers. Hawaiian Punch, Hi-C and Minute Maid are three of the better-known brands in the US. Other related drinks include Kool-Aid powdered drink mix, fassionola, and Tiki Punch (a carbonated soft drink from Shasta).

=== Alcoholic ===

Historically, most spirit based early alcoholic punches were made using either arrack or rum. &quot;Bajan (Barbadian) rum punch&quot; is one of the oldest rum punches and has a simple recipe enshrined in a national rhyme: &quot;One of Sour, Two of Sweet, Three of Strong, Four of Weak.&quot; That is: one part lime juice, two parts sweetener, three parts rum (preferably Barbados), and four parts water. It is served with a dash or two of Angostura bitters and nutmeg.

There are many rum-based punches, including Planter&#x27;s Punch, Fish House Punch, Caribbean Rum Punch, and others. Arrack based punches were included in Jacob Grohusko&#x27;s 1910 and Charles Mahoney&#x27;s 1912 bartenders guides, and an early recipe for arrack punch was written by Pehr Osbeck, Olof Torén, and Carl Gustaf Ekeberg in their 1771 book, &quot;A Voyage to China and the East Indies&quot;: 
Alcoholic punches are common among parties for college and university students. These punches tend to be highly alcoholic and made with cheap ingredients. They may be referred to by names such as &quot;grain punch&quot; (made with high-proof grain alcohol and sundry mixers) or &quot;Jungle Juice&quot; (liquor of various sorts brought to a BYOB party, mixed in a lined trash can with various carbonated beverages, kool-aid, or whatever is on hand). Some exclude additional water altogether and have 30% alcohol by volume (ABV) or more.

==Punches around the world==

=== Australia ===
Blow My Skull is a famous alcoholic punch drink that originated in mid-19th-century Australia that contains rum, porter, lime, sugar, and other ingredients.

=== Barbados ===
&quot;Bajan Punch&quot; is made with rum, lime juice, cane sugar, nutmeg, and bitters. Falernum liqueur is also frequently added, which was itself an early form of punch made by steeping cloves with rum, lime, and other ingredients.

=== Caribbean ===
Ti&#x27; Punch, literally meaning &quot;small punch&quot;, is a rum-based punch that is especially popular in Martinique and other French-speaking islands of Caribbean. The drink is traditionally made with white rhum agricole, lime, and cane syrup. Caribbean Fruit Punch is a more fruity non-alcoholic version typically found in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago.

=== England ===
A &quot;cup&quot; is a style of punch, traditionally served before the departure of a hunting party in England. It is served at a variety of social events such as garden parties, cricket and tennis matches, and picnics. Cups are generally lower in alcohol content than other punches and usually use wine, cider, sloe gin, or liqueurs as the base. They often include quantities of fruit juices or soft drinks.

A well-known cup is the Pimm&#x27;s Cup, using Pimm&#x27;s No.1 (which contains gin) and British-style lemonade at a ratio of 1:2; a squeeze of lemon; then add orange, lemon and apple slices; a couple of cucumber wedges; and decorate with borage flowers.

=== Germany ===

Punch (&quot;Punsch&quot; in German) refers to a mixture of several fruit juices and spices, often with wine or liquor added and mostly topped with champagne or sparkling wine. Punch is popular in Germany and with many Germans who emigrated to America. Parties on New Year&#x27;s Eve (&quot;Silvester&quot;) often include a &quot;Feuerzangenbowle&quot; (&quot;burnt punch&quot; or, literally, &quot;fire tongs punch&quot;). This is a punch made of red wine and flaming overproof rum (such as Stroh), poured over a &quot;Zuckerhut&quot; (sugarloaf), a large conical sugar cube placed in the &quot;Feuerzange&quot;. It is similar to mulled wine (&quot;Glühwein&quot;). Another warm punch, popular with hunters or others spending time in the cold, is jagertee punch.

=== Indian subcontinent ===
Arrack-based punches were historically popular in India and Sri Lanka, where it was distilled from toddy, the wine made from sap of various palm trees.

=== Korea ===
Hwachae is a term for traditional Korean punches. &quot;Sujeonggwa&quot; is a traditional punch made from dried persimmons, cinnamon, and ginger.

=== Mexico ===

Ponche is traditionally prepared during the Christmas season in Mexico. It is served hot, typically accompanied by other Mexican holiday staples like tamales, champurrado and pan dulce. Some ingredients used to make &quot;ponche&quot; are more seasonal and are sometimes hard to get. Fresh &quot;tejocotes&quot;, the fruit of the hawthorn tree known to the Aztecs as Texocotli (stone fruit), and guavas are among the most usual. Other common ingredients in &quot;ponche&quot; include sugar cane pieces, piloncillo, apples, pears, dry hibiscus, raisins, prunes, clove and star anise.

=== Argentina ===
In Argentina and Uruguay, Claret Cup has been introduced by British immigrants and was widely adopted by the population. Known as &quot;Clericó&quot;, its Spanishized form, it is the traditional Christmas and New Year punch, which occur in the summer of the Southern Hemisphere. It is made with red wine and fruits such as oranges, apples, peaches, strawberries, etc. Other alcoholic beverages are commonly added in combination. In Argentina it is generally served from a punch bowl (&quot;ponchera&quot;).

Due to its proximity to Argentina, Paraguay has also adopted &quot;Clericó&quot; (and with the same Spanishized name) and it is also consumed during Christmas and New Year celebrations there. In Paraguay, it is typically served from a clay pot called &quot;kambuchi&quot;.

=== Sweden ===
&quot;Punch&quot; is typically called in Sweden, and is commonly served in a bowl at social functions (e.g. graduation or wedding receptions). Bål as thought of broadly should not be confused with punsch, which is a specific type of alcoholic punch using arrack that was very popular in Sweden in the decades around 1900. Due to its popularity the arrack punch saw commercial bottling in 1845, and became known more broadly outside Scandinavia as the liqueur Swedish punsch.

&quot;Dragoon punch&quot; was popular in Sweden and Norway in the early 1900s, and added both stout and beer to brandy, champagne, and sherry.

=== United States ===

Some claim &quot;Planter&#x27;s Punch&quot; was invented by bartender Jerry Thomas at the Planter&#x27;s House Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri. The recipe for Planter&#x27;s Punch varies, containing some combination of rum, lemon juice, pineapple juice, lime juice, orange juice, grenadine, soda water, curaçao, Angostura bitters, and cayenne pepper. An early print reference to Planter&#x27;s Punch appeared in the August 8, 1908 edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
This recipe I give to thee,
dear brother in the heat.
Take two of sour (lime let it be)
To one and a half of sweet,
of Old Jamaica pour three strong,
and add four parts of weak.
Then mix and drink. I do no wrong —
I know whereof I speak.
&quot;Southern bourbon punch&quot; is a drink closely associated with Kentucky and other Southern states. Sweet bourbon punch is made with sweet tea (a signature drink of the South), citrus flavors and bourbon whiskey. Bourbon is named for Bourbon County, Kentucky, and each year during the Kentucky Derby, recipes for bourbon punch abound.

&quot;Fish House Punch&quot; is a classic 18th-century punch containing rum, cognac, and peach brandy first created at the State in Schuylkill club in Philadelphia. Guests of the club who partook of the punch include George Washington, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Chester A. Arthur. Though the exact formula for the punch has been officially kept secret by the club&#x27;s members, published recipes for the punch date back to at least 1862. The punch has regained popularity in the 21st century, partially due to the renewed availability of real peach brandy from modern craft distillers.

Much like Swedish &quot;punsch&quot;, a number of punches bottled as liqueurs became regional specialties starting in the late-19th century. &quot;Hub Punch&quot; was created at the Hub House hotel in Thousand Islands, New York, and was bottled from 1879 until Prohibition by C.H. Graves &amp; Sons of Boston. Hub Punch was briefly revived by Boston&#x27;s Bully Boy Distillers in 2014. &quot;Cohasset Punch&quot; was bottled in Chicago for nearly a century from 1899 until the late-1980s, and was later referred to as &quot;the definitive Chicago cocktail.&quot; Cohasset Punch was relaunched under new ownership in 2024.

<doc id="441567" wikidata="Q701182" url="?curid=441567" title="Hijikata Toshizō">
<text>was a Japanese swordsman of the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; period and of the &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;. As Vice-Commander, he served the Tokugawa Shogunate and co-led his group in its resistance against the imperial rule brought about by the Meiji Restoration. He fought against the Imperial Army during the Boshin War until his death at the Battle of Hakodate, which ended the war.

==Background==
 was born on May 31, 1835, in the Ishida village, Tama region of Musashi Province (present day Ishida, Hino, Tokyo), Japan. He was the youngest of ten children and his father Hijikata Yoshiatsu (Hayato), a well-to-do farmer, died a few months before his birth. His eldest brother Tamejiro, was born blind and as a result, could not inherit the family property. His third older brother Daisaku (later Kasuya Ryojin), was adopted to another family and would later become a physician. His eldest sister Shuu died when he was about three years old and his mother Etsu also died when he was six years old, and he was therefore raised by his second older brother Kiroku and sister-in-law.

He was apparently tall compared to the average Japanese men of the period, and it is said that he was very handsome. He was said to be spoiled at an early age and was alleged to be mean to all but his friends and family. This changed when a 21-year-old swordsman from the Aizu clan known for opposing the Reformists was forced to commit seppuku. When Hijikata attended the man&#x27;s funeral, he apparently cried in public.

Hijikata spent his youth selling his family&#x27;s Ishida san&#x27;yaku (medicine for treating injuries such as bruises and broken bones) while practicing his self-taught kenjutsu. His brother-in-law, Satō Hikogorō, who was married to his older sister Nobu, managed a Tennen Rishin-ryū dojo in Hino; through Satō, Hijikata later met Kondō Isami and was formally enrolled at the Tennen Rishin-ryū&#x27;s Shieikan in 1859. Although Hijikata himself never fully mastered the Tennen Rishin-ryū, it is said that he managed to develop the &quot;Shinsengumi-Kenjutsu&quot; fighting style from the Tennen Rishin-ryū.

An arrangement was made by his eldest brother Tamejiro for him to marry Okoto, the daughter of the shamisen shop owners. Since he had already planned to join the Rōshigumi with Kondō Isami, Hijikata told them that after he got a promotion, he would carry out his marriage.

==Shinsengumi period==

In 1863, Hijikata and Kondō Isami joined the Rōshigumi in Edo, they arrived in Mibu, Kyoto and remained there as the Mibu Rōshigumi while the rest returned to Edo. Later, when Mibu Rōshigumi was renamed as the Shinsengumi, Kondō and two other men, Serizawa Kamo and Niimi Nishiki, became joint leaders of the group, and Hijikata served as one of the deputy leaders. Shinsengumi served as a special police force in Kyoto that fought against the Reformists under Matsudaira Katamori, the Daimyō of Aizu.

However, Serizawa and Niimi began fighting, drinking, and extorting money from merchants in Kyoto, which started to tarnish the reputation of Shinsengumi and earned the group the derogatory nickname of . Hijikata found enough proof against Niimi in these matters and ordered him to commit seppuku on October 19. Later on October 30 (or October 28) at night, Hijikata and the selected Shinsengumi members went into the house of Yagi Gennojō and assassinated Serizawa, his mistress Oume, and one of his followers Hirayama Goro, with Hirama Jūsuke been the only survivor who fled that night. Kondō became the sole leader of Shinsengumi, with Yamanami Keisuke as his Vice-Commander. During the Ikedaya incident in the evening on July 8, 1864, Hijikata led a second group of 23 Shinsengumi members after Kondō&#x27;s to help arresting a group of shishi at the Ikedaya Inn.

Some time after the Zenzaiya incident, Yamanami Keisuke tried to leave Shinsengumi, despite the regulation against deserters. As a result, he committed seppuku with Okita Sōji as his Kaishakunin on March 20 (lunar calendar February 23), 1865; and Hijikata took over as Vice-Commander. Due to his position in the Shinsengumi, which would be dangerous for anyone close to him, Hijikata felt that he had no choice but to cancel his marriage engagement with Okoto. Although he later had many lovers, he never came close to making a commitment to any of them.

The Shinsengumi grew to 140 men, which included a number of farmers and merchants whose livelihood would be threatened if the Tokugawa shogunate was overthrown. The regulations set up by Shinsengumi within Kyoto were strict and Hijikata was known to be harsh in enforcing them, hence his nickname: . Even within the Shinsengumi itself, regulations were strictly enforced by Hijikata. As usual, deserters and traitors were forced to commit seppuku.

Hijikata owned, among others, a sword signed &quot;Izumi no Kami Kanesada&quot; (和泉守兼定), made by the 11th and last generation Aizu Kanesada (1837-1903).

Together with the rest of the Shinsengumi, Hijikata became a &quot;hatamoto&quot; in 1867 and took the name of Naitō Hayato (but reverted to his original name after Kondō was captured and executed during the Boshin war). He was given the rank of Yoriai (寄合格 Yoriai-kaku) in early 1868.

==Boshin War==

Following the Boshin War in 1868, Kondō and Hijikata led the Shinsengumi in their final battles against the new government and fought in the Battle of Toba–Fushimi in January 1868. The Shinsengumi returned to Edo and was later reformed into a unit known as the and departed from Edo for Kōfu Castle on March 24 upon orders to suppress the uprisings there. But while on the way there, they received news on March 28 that the Kōfu Castle was taken by Imperial Court forces led by Itagaki Taisuke and later settled at the town of Katsunuma five miles east of Kōfu.

On March 29, 1868, Kondō, Hijikata and the Kōyō Chinbutai resisted an attack by the Imperial forces at the Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma for about two hours but lost, and they were scattered and fled to Edo.

On April 11, 1868, Kondō, Hijikata and the Kōyō Chinbutai departed Edo again and later set up a temporary headquarters at the Kaneko family estate, northeast of Edo. They later moved to a new quarters in Nagareyama on April 25, 1868.

During the training at Nagareyama on April 26, 1868, the Kōyō Chinbutai were caught by surprise by the 200 strong Imperial forces led by Vice-chief of Staff Arima Tota of Satsuma Domain and Kondō was ordered to go with them to their camp at Koshigaya. He was later brought to Itabashi on April 27, 1868, for questioning. On the same day Hijikata went to Edo to see Katsu Kaishū and asked for his help in getting a pardon for Kondō. On the following day, a messenger arrived at Itabashi with a letter seemingly written by Katsu requesting that Kondō&#x27;s life to be spared, but the messenger was arrested and the request was denied.

Following his trial on April 30, 1868, Kondō was executed at Itabashi execution grounds on May 17, 1868. Hijikata, convalesced from a foot injury sustained at the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle, brought Kondō&#x27;s strands of hair to Aizu and was said to have personally supervised the erection of Kondō&#x27;s grave memorial at Tenneiji Temple.

Following the Battle of Bonari Pass, the next day on October 7, 1868, Hijikata met Saitō Hajime at the Inawashiro Castle and stayed at the Saitoya inn in Wakamatsu. When Hijikata decided to retreat from Aizu, Saitō and a small group of Shinsengumi parted with Hijikata and continued to battle in the Battle of Aizu until the very end. Hijikata and his rest of the Shinsengumi went to Sendai, where he joined up with Enomoto Takeaki&#x27;s fleet.

He knew he was fighting a losing battle, and told the physician Matsumoto Ryōjun:

I am not going to battle to win. With the Tokugawa government about to collapse, it would be a disgrace if no one is willing to go down with it. That is why I must go. I will fight the best battle of my life to die for the country.
In October 1868, Hijikata and Ōtori Keisuke led Shogunate forces to occupy the fortress of Goryōkaku in the Battle of Hakodate, and continued to eliminate local resistance. When the short-lived Ezo Republic was founded in December, Hijikata was made a Deputy Defence Minister (Vice-minister of the Army). Imperial troops continued to attack by land and sea.

On May 6, 1869, Hijikata led a daring but doomed raid to steal the imperial warship &quot;Kōtetsu&quot; in the Battle of Miyako Bay, in the early morning, a number of oppositionists managed to board the ship via the &quot;Kaiten&quot; warship, but &quot;Kōtetsu&quot; repelled the attack and mowed them down with a Gatling gun. Many others including the captain of &quot;Kaiten&quot; were also killed by gunfire from the Imperial ships. The battle lasted only thirty minutes; Hijikata, the survivors and the &quot;Kaiten&quot; retreated to Hakodate.

Later on the fourth week of May 1869, Hijikata led the 230-strong Republic of Ezo forces and the surviving Shinsengumi against 600 strong Imperial forces during the Battle of Futamata for sixteen hours and were forced to retreat. The Imperial forces attacked again on the next day, only to retreat. On the following night, Hijikata led a successful raid on the Imperial forces&#x27; camp, forcing them to flee. Hijikata and the forces later retreated to Hakodate on June 10.

===Death===
During the Battle of Hakodate, the final battle of the Boshin War, Hijikata summoned his 16-year-old page, Ichimura Tetsunosuke on June 14 (lunar calendar May 5), 1869, to a private room in an inn. There, he entrusted Ichimura with a death poem, his katana, a letter, a photograph of himself, and several strands of his hair. Ichimura was instructed to bear them to the home of Hijikata&#x27;s brother-in-law Satō Hikogorō in Hino. The death poem entrusted to Ichimura reads:

Though my body may decay on the island of Ezo, my spirit guards my lord in the East.

In the final conflict of the revolution, on June 20 (lunar calendar May 11), 1869, Hijikata was killed near the Ippongi Kanmon (一本木関門) by a bullet that shattered his lower back while leading his troops on horseback. His body was later claimed by Koshiba Chōnosuke and others.

Three days later on June 23 (lunar calendar May 14), 1869, a group of surviving Shinsengumi members under the last commander Sōma Kazue surrendered at Benten Daiba. A week after Hijikata&#x27;s death, the Goryōkaku fortress was taken and all military forces of the Ezo Republic surrendered to the Meiji government on June 27, 1869, marking the end of Boshin War.

It is unknown where Hijikata was buried but it is believed that his body was laid to rest either at Goryōkaku, Hekketsuhi or Ganjoji.

==Grave memorials and monuments==
The first grave memorial of Hijikata was at Wakamatsu-chō, Hakodate, where he was killed, near the reconstructed Ippongi Kanmon in the present day compound of the Hakodate Welfare Centre.

A grave memorial of Hijikata was also erected at Sekidenji temple in Hino, Tokyo, Japan.

Other grave memorials were located at Shōmyōji (Hakodate, Hokkaido), Tenneji (Aizuwakamatsu), Jutokuji (Kita, Tokyo), Entsūji (Kita, Tokyo), etc.

A monument known as Hekketsuhi, was erected at Hakodate in memory of about 800 people, including Hijikata, who died during the Boshin War.

In 1875, Nagakura Shinpachi, with the help of Matsumoto Ryōjun and several of his surviving former Shinsengumi comrades including Saitō Hajime among others, erected the monument known as the &quot;Grave of Shinsengumi&quot; for Kondō Isami, Hijikata Toshizō, and the fallen comrades of the Shinsengumi at Jutoku-ji temple boundary in Itabashi, near Itabashi Station in Tokyo.

The Hijikata Toshizō Museum was later established in 1994 near the Sekidenji temple.

==In popular culture==
The Shinsengumi have become a popular subject for films, television, and manga and anime, ranging from historical drama to comedy and romance. As a leader of the group, Hijikata is usually a prominent character in such productions.

The novel Moeyo Ken, written by Ryōtarō Shiba, is a dramatization of Hijikata&#x27;s life. The novel was adapted into a film in 1966 and a television series in 1970 where Hijikata was played by Asahi Kurizuka. Adapted from the same novel in the 2021 film &quot;&quot;, Hijikata was played by Junichi Okada, a member of Japanese boy band V6.

Hijikata is depicted in the 1999 film &quot;Gohatto&quot; (&quot;Taboo&quot;) (played by Takeshi Kitano) and the 2013 NHK Taiga drama &quot;Yae no Sakura&quot; (played by Jun Murakami). He was also played by Koji Yamamoto in both the 2004 NHK Taiga drama series &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; (including the single-episode sequel &quot;Shinsengumi!: Hijikata Toshizo Saigo no Ichinichi&quot;) and 2015 morning drama series &quot;Asa ga Kita&quot;. He is the protagonist in Morita Kenji&#x27;s manga &quot;Getsumei Seiki&quot;, and in Mibu Robin&#x27;s &quot;Baragaki&quot; (&quot;Red Demon&quot;).

He is also featured in a number of other anime and manga series, including &quot;Gintama&quot; (an inspired character named Hijikata Tōshi&quot;rō&quot; 土方 十四郎), &quot;Peacemaker Kurogane&quot;, &quot;Intrigue in the Bakumatsu - Irohanihoheto&quot;, &quot;Ghost Slayers Ayashi&quot; (as a child, with a brief glimpse of his future death); &quot;Kaze Hikaru&quot;, &quot;Shura no Toki&quot;, &quot;Hell Girl&quot;, &quot;Soar High! Isami&quot; (inspired character: Toshi Tsukikage) and the popular otome game/anime series &quot;.&quot; Hijikata is also a supporting character in &quot;Shin Teito Monogatari&quot;, the prequel to the bestselling historical fantasy novel &quot;Teito Monogatari&quot; (Hiroshi Aramata). In the manga and anime, &quot;Drifters&quot;, Hijikata serves as one of the antagonists, who holds hatred to the protagonist, Shimazu Toyohisa, because he is an ancestor of the Shimazu clan he fought. He is also a main character in the manga &quot;Golden Kamuy&quot;, having been secretly imprisoned in Abashiri Prison instead of killed.
Hijikata appears in the 2014 historical fiction novel &quot;The Soldier and the Samurai&quot;.() In 2024, the story of Hijikata served as a backdrop for the 27th Detective Conan movie &quot;The Million-Dollar Pentagram&quot;. Hijikata is a antagonist in anime series Ao no Miburo.

Hijikata is one of the main characters in the 2014 video game &quot;Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!&quot;, voiced by Nakamura Shidō II. He has the visual likeness of previous series antagonist Yoshitaka Mine.

Hijikata also appears in the mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; as a limited 5-Star Berserker-class Servant. He debuted during the GUDAGUDA 2: Meiji Restoration event, and his Noble Phantasm is known as Shinsengumi, which gets stronger as his HP dwindles.

<doc id="441569" wikidata="Q213422" url="?curid=441569" title="Seneca people">
<text>The Seneca ( ; ) are a group of Indigenous Iroquoian-speaking people who historically lived south of Lake Ontario, one of the five Great Lakes in North America. Their nation was the farthest to the west within the Six Nations or Iroquois League (Haudenosaunee) in New York before the American Revolution. For this reason, they are called “The Keepers of the Western Door.”

In the 21st century, more than 10,000 Seneca live in the United States, which has three federally recognized Seneca tribes. Two of them are centered in New York: the Seneca Nation of Indians, with five territories in western New York near Buffalo; and the Tonawanda Seneca Nation. The Seneca-Cayuga Nation is in Oklahoma, where their ancestors were relocated from Ohio during the Indian Removal. Approximately 1,000 Seneca live in Canada, near Brantford, Ontario, at the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation. They are descendants of Seneca who resettled there after the American Revolution, as they had been allies of the British and forced to cede much of their lands.

==Name==
The Seneca&#x27;s own name for themselves is &quot;O-non-dowa-gah&quot; or &quot;Onödowá’ga&quot;, meaning &quot;Great Hill People&quot; The exonym &quot;Seneca&quot; is &quot;the Anglicized form of the Dutch pronunciation of the Mohegan rendering of the Iroquoian ethnic appellative&quot; originally referring to the Oneida. The Dutch applied the name &quot;Sennecaas&quot; promiscuously to the four westernmost nations, the Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca, but with increasing contact the name came to be applied only to the latter. The French called them &quot;Sonontouans&quot;. The Dutch name is also often spelled &quot;Sinnikins&quot; or &quot;Sinnekars&quot;, which was later corrupted to Senecas.

==History==
Seneca oral history states that the tribe originated in a village called Nundawao, near the south end of Canandaigua Lake, at South Hill. Close to South Hill stands the Bare Hill, known to the Seneca as . Bare Hill is part of the Bare Hill Unique Area, which began to be acquired by the state in 1989. Bare Hill had been the site of a Seneca (or Seneca-ancestral people) fort.

The first written reference to this fort was made in 1825 by the Tuscarora historian David Cusick in his history of the Seneca Indians.

In the early 1920s, the material that made up the Bare Hill fort was used by the Town of Middlesex highway department for road fill.

The Seneca historically lived in what is now New York state between the Genesee River and Canandaigua Lake. The dating of an oral tradition mentioning a solar eclipse yields 1142 AD as the year for the Seneca joining the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee). Some recent archaeological evidence indicates their territory eventually extended to the Allegheny River in present-day northwestern Pennsylvania, particularly after the Iroquois destroyed both the Wenrohronon and Erie nations in the 17th century, who were native to the area. The Seneca were by far the most populous of the Haudenosaunee nations, numbering about four thousand by the seventeenth century.

Seneca villages were located as far east as current-day Schuyler County (e.g. Catherine&#x27;s Town and Kanadaseaga), south into current Tioga and Chemung counties, north and east into Tompkins and Cayuga counties, and west into the Genesee River valley. The villages were the homes and headquarters of the Seneca. While the Seneca maintained substantial permanent settlements and raised agricultural crops in the vicinity of their villages, they also hunted widely through extensive areas. They also executed far-reaching military campaigns. The villages, where hunting and military campaigns were planned and executed, indicate the Seneca had hegemony in these areas.

Major Seneca villages were protected with wooden palisades. Ganondagan, with 150 longhouses, was the largest Seneca village of the 17th century, while Chenussio, with 130 longhouses, was a major village of the 18th century.

The Seneca nation has two branches: the western and the eastern. Each branch was individually incorporated and recognized by the Iroquois Confederacy Council. The western Seneca lived predominantly in and around the Genesee River, gradually moving west and southwest along Lake Erie and the Niagara River, then south along the Allegheny River into Pennsylvania. The eastern Seneca lived predominantly south of Seneca Lake. They moved south and east into Pennsylvania and the western Catskill area.

The west and north were under constant attack from their powerful Iroquoian brethren, the Huron (Wyandot) To the South, the Iroquoian-speaking tribes of the Susquehannock (Conestoga) also threatened constant warfare. The Algonquian tribes of the Mohican blocked access to the Hudson River in the east and northeast. In the southeast, the Algonkian tribes of the Lenape people (Delaware, Minnisink and Esopus) threatened war from eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and the Lower Hudson.

The Seneca used the Genesee and Allegheny rivers, as well as the Great Indian War and Trading Path (the Seneca Trail), to travel from southern Lake Ontario into Pennsylvania and Ohio (Merrill, Arch. &quot;Land of the Senecas&quot;; Empire State Books, 1949, pp. 18–25). The eastern Seneca had territory just north of the intersection of the Chemung, Susquehanna, Tioga and Delaware rivers, which converged in Tioga. The rivers provided passage deep into all parts of eastern and western Pennsylvania, as well as east and northeast into the Delaware Water Gap and the western Catskills. The men of both branches of the Seneca wore the same headgear. Like the other Haudenosaunee, they wore hats with dried cornhusks on top. The Seneca wore theirs with one feather sticking up straight.

Traditionally, the Seneca Nation&#x27;s economy was based on hunting and gathering activities, fishing, and the cultivation of varieties of corn, beans, and squash. These vegetables were the staple of the Haudenosaunee diet and were called &quot;the three sisters&quot; (työhe&#x27;hköh). Seneca women generally grew and harvested varieties of the three sisters, as well as gathering and processing medicinal plants, roots, berries, nuts, and fruit. Seneca women held sole ownership of all the land and the homes. The women also tended to any domesticated animals such as dogs and turkeys.

Seneca men were generally in charge of locating and developing the town sites, including clearing the forest for the production of fields. Seneca men also spent a great deal of time hunting and fishing. This activity took them away from the towns or villages to well-known and productive hunting and fishing grounds for extended amounts of time. These hunting and fishing locations were altered and well maintained to encourage game; they were not simply &quot;wild&quot; lands. Seneca men maintained the traditional title of war sachems within the Haudenosaunee. A Seneca war sachem was in charge of gathering the warriors and leading them into battle.

Seneca people lived in villages and towns. Archaeological excavations indicate that some of these villages were surrounded by palisades because of warfare. These towns were relocated every ten to twenty years as soil, game and other resources were depleted. During the nineteenth century, many Seneca adopted customs of their immediate American neighbors by building log cabins, practicing Christianity, and participating in the local agricultural economy.

=== Daily life of the Seneca ===
The Seneca traditionally lived in longhouses, which are large buildings that were up to 100 feet long and approximately 20 feet wide. The longhouses were shared among related families and could hold up to 60 people. Hearths were located in the central aisle, and two families shared a hearth. Over time they began to build cabins, similar to those of their American neighbors.

The main form of social organization is the clan, or , nominally each descended from one woman. The Seneca have eight clans: Bear (), Wolf (), Turtle (), Beaver( ), Deer (), Hawk (), Snipe (), and Heron (). The clans are divided into two &quot;sides&quot; (moieties)the Bear, Wolf, Turtle, and Beaver are the &quot;animal&quot; side, and the Deer, Hawk, Snipe, and Heron are the &quot;bird&quot; side.

The Iroquois have a matrilineal kinship system; inheritance and property descend through the maternal line. Women are in charge of the clans. Children are considered born into their mother&#x27;s clan and take their social status from her family. Their mother&#x27;s eldest brother was traditionally more of a major figure in their lives than their biological father, who does not belong to their clan. The presiding elder of a clan is called the &quot;clan mother&quot;. Despite the prominent position of women in Iroquois society, their influence on the diplomacy of the nation was limited. If the &quot;clan mothers&quot; do not agree with any major decisions made by the chiefs, they can eventually depose them.

===Seneca Archery===
Arrows from the area are made from split hickory, although shoots of dogwood and Viburnum were used as well. The eastern two feather style of fletching was used, although three radial feathers were also used.

The Smithsonian Institution has an example of a Seneca bow, which was donated 1908. It is made of unbacked hickory, and is tip to tip. Although the string is missing for the specimen, when strung it would make a good &quot;D&quot; shape with slightly recurved tips, and was obviously made for bigger game. The tips are irregular in shape, which is typical from this region.

=== Contact with Europeans ===
During the colonial period, the Seneca became involved in the fur trade, first with the Dutch and then with the British. This served to increase hostility with competing native groups, especially their traditional enemy, the Huron (Wyandot), an Iroquoian-speaking tribe located near Lac Toronto in New France.

In 1609, the French allied with the Huron (Wyandot) and set out to destroy the Iroquois. The Iroquois-Huron war raged until approximately 1650. Led by the Seneca, the Confederacy began a near 35-year period of conquest over surrounding tribes following the defeat of its most powerful enemy, the Huron (Wyandot). The Confederacy conducted Mourning Wars to take captives to replace people lost in a severe smallpox epidemic in 1635. Through raids, they stabilized their population after adopting young women and children as captives and incorporating them into the tribes. By the winter of 1648, the Confederacy, led by the Seneca, fought deep into Canada and surrounded the capital of Huronia. Weakened by population losses due to their own smallpox epidemics as well as warfare, the Huron (Wyandot) unconditionally surrendered. They pledged allegiance to the Seneca as their protector. The Seneca subjugated the Huron (Wyandot) survivors and sent them to assimilate in the Seneca homelands.

In 1650, the Seneca attacked and defeated the Neutrals to their west. In 1653, the Seneca attacked and defeated the Erie to their southwest. Survivors of both the Huron and Erie were subjugated to the Seneca and relocated to the Seneca homeland. The Seneca took over the vanquished tribe&#x27;s traditional territories in western New York.

In 1675, the Seneca defeated the Andaste (Susquehannock) to the south and southeast. The Confederacy&#x27;s hegemony extended along the frontier from Canada to Ohio, deep into Pennsylvania, along the Mohawk Valley and into the lower Hudson in the east. They sought peace with the Algonquian-speaking Mohegan (Mahican), who lived along the Hudson River. Within the Confederacy, Seneca power and presence extended from Canada to what would become Pittsburgh, east to the future Lackawanna and into the land of the Minnisink on the New York /New Jersey border.

The Seneca tried to curtail the encroachment of white settlers. This increased tensions and conflict with the French to the north and west, and the English and Dutch to the south and east. As buffers, the Confederacy resettled conquered tribes between them and the European settlers, with the greatest concentration of resettlements on the lower Susquehanna.

In 1685, King Louis XIV of France sent Marquis de Denonville to govern New France in Quebec. Denonville set out to destroy the Seneca Nation and in 1687 landed a French armada with &quot;the largest army North America had ever seen&quot; at Irondequoit Bay. Denonville struck straight into the seat of Seneca power and destroyed many of its villages, including the Seneca&#x27;s eastern capital of Ganondagan. Fleeing before the attack, the Seneca moved further west, east and south down the Susquehanna River. Although great damage was done to the Seneca homeland, the Seneca&#x27;s military might was not appreciably weakened. The Confederacy and the Seneca moved into an alliance with the British in the east.

===Senecas&#x27; expanding influence and diplomacy===

In and around 1600, the area currently comprising Sullivan, Ulster and Orange counties of New York was home to the Lenape Indians, an Algonquian-speaking people whose territory extended deep along the coastal areas of the mid-Atlantic coast, up into present-day Connecticut. They occupied the western part of Long Island as well. The Lenape nation was Algonkian-speaking and made up of the Delaware, Minnisink and Esopus bands, differentiated according to their territories. These bands later became known as the Munsee, based on their shared dialect. (Folts at pp 32) The Munsee inhabited large tracts of land from the middle Hudson into the Delaware Water Gap, and into northeast Pennsylvania and northwest New Jersey. The Esopus inhabited the Mid-Hudson valley (Sullivan and Ulster counties). The Minnisink inhabited northwest New Jersey. The Delaware inhabited the southern Susquehanna and Delaware water gaps. The Minnisink-Esopus trail, today&#x27;s Route 209, helped tie this world together.

To the west of the Delaware nation were the Iroquoian-speaking Andaste/Susquehannock. To the east of the Delaware Nation lay the encroaching peoples of Dutch New Netherland. From Manhattan, up through the Hudson, the settlers were interested in trading furs with the Susquehannock occupying territory in and around current Lancaster, Pennsylvania. As early as 1626, the Susquehannock were struggling to get past the Delaware to trade with the Dutch in New Amsterdam (Manhattan). In 1634, war broke out between the Delaware and the Susquehannock, and by 1638, the defeated Delaware became tributaries to the Susquehanna.

The Iroquois Confederacy to the north was growing in strength and numbers, and the Seneca, as the most numerous and adventurous, began to travel extensively. Eastern Seneca traveled down the Chemung River to the Susquehanna River. At Tioga the Seneca had access to every corner of Munsee country. Seneca warriors traveled the Forbidden Path south to Tioga to the Great Warrior Path to Scranton and then east over the Minnisink Path through the Lorde&#x27;s valley to Minisink. The Delaware River path went straight south through the ancient Indian towns of Cookhouse, Cochecton and Minnisink, where it became the Minsi Path.

Using these ancient highways, the Seneca exerted influence in what is today Ulster and Sullivan counties from the Dutch colonial era onward. Historical evidence demonstrating Seneca presence in the Lower Catskills includes:

In 1657 and 1658, the Seneca visited, as diplomats, Dutch colonial officials in New Amsterdam.

In 1659 and 1660, the Seneca interceded in the First Esopus War, which was going on between the Dutch and Esopus at current-day Kingston. The Seneca chief urged Stuyvesant to end the bloodshed and &quot;return the captured Esopus savages&quot;.

In 1675, after a decade of warfare between the Iroquois (mainly the Mohawk and Oneida) and the Andaste/Susquehannock, the Seneca finally succeeded in vanquishing their last remaining great enemy.(Parker at pp 49) Survivors were colonized in settlements along the Susquehanna River and were assimilated into the Seneca and Cayuga people.

In 1694, Captain Arent Schuyler, in an official report, described the Minnisink chiefs as being fearful of being attacked by the Seneca because of not paying wampum tribute to these Iroquois.

Around 1700, the upper Delaware watershed of New York and Pennsylvania became home of the Minnisink Indians moving north and northwest from New Jersey, and of Esopus Indians moving west from the Mid-Hudson valley.

By 1712, the Esopus Indians were reported to have reached the east Pepacton branch of the Delaware River, on the western slopes of the Catskill Mountains.

From 1720 to the 1750s, the Seneca resettled and assimilated the Munsee into their people and the Confederacy. Historical accounts had noted the difficulties encountered by the Seneca during this period and noted a dissolution of their traditional society under pressure of disease and encroachment by European Americans. But fieldwork at the 1715–1754 Seneca Townley-Read site near Geneva, New York, has recovered evidence of &quot;substantial Seneca autonomy, selectivity, innovation, and opportunism in an era usually considered to be one of cultural disintegration&quot;. In 1756, the Confederacy directed the Munsee to settle in a new satellite town in Seneca territory called Assinisink (where Corning developed) on the Chemung River. In this period, they developed satellite towns for war captives who were being assimilated near several of their major towns. The Seneca received some of the Munsee&#x27;s war prisoners as part of their negotiations.

At a peace conference in Easton, Pennsylvania in 1758, the Seneca chief Tagashata required the Munsee and Minnisink to conclude a peace with the colonists and &quot;take the hatchet out of your heads, and bury it under ground, where it shall always rest and never be taken up again&quot;. A large delegation of Iroquois attended this meeting to demonstrate that the Munsee were under their protection.

In 1759, as colonial records indicate, negotiators had to go through the Seneca in order to have diplomatic success with the Munsee.

Despite the French military campaigns, Seneca power remained far-reaching at the beginning of the 18th century. Gradually, the Seneca began to ally with their trading partners, the Dutch and British, against France&#x27;s ambitions in the New World. By 1760 during the Seven Years&#x27; War, they helped the British capture Fort Niagara from the French. The Seneca had relative peace from 1760 to 1775. In 1763 a Seneca war party ambushed a British supply train and soldiers in Battle of Devil&#x27;s Hole, also known as the Devil&#x27;s Hole massacre, during Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion.

After the American Revolutionary War broke out between the British and the colonists, the Seneca at first attempted to remain neutral but both sides tried to bring them into the action. When the rebel colonists defeated the British at Fort Stanwix, they killed many Seneca onlookers.

===Interactions with the United States===
==== Pre-American Revolution Involvement ====
The Seneca Tribe before the American Revolution had a prosperous society. The Iroquois Confederacy had ended the fighting amongst the war-based Iroquois tribes and allowed them to live in peace with each other. Yet, despite this peace amongst themselves, the Iroquois tribes were all revered as fierce warriors and were reputed to control together a large empire that stretched hundreds of miles along the Appalachian Mountains. The Seneca were a part of this confederacy with the Cayuga, Onondagas, Oneidas, Mohawks, and, later on, the Tuscaroras. However, although the Seneca and Iroquois tribes had ceased fighting each other, they still continued to conduct raids on outsiders, or rather their European visitors.

Despite the Iroquois continuing raids on their new European neighbors, the Iroquois tribes struck up profitable relationships with the Europeans, especially the English. In 1677, the English were able to make an alliance with the Iroquois league called the &quot;Covenant Chain&quot;. In 1768, the English renewed this alliance when Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet signed the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768. This treaty put the British in good favor with the Iroquois, as they felt that the British had their best interests in mind as well. The Americans, unlike the British, were disliked by the Seneca because of their continual disregard for the Treaty of Fort Stanwix. Specifically, the Iroquois were enraged by the Americans movement into the Ohio Territory. However, despite their continual encroachment on established Iroquois land, the Americans respected their skills at warfare and attempted to exclude them from their conflict with the British. The Americans viewed their conflict with the British as a conflict meant to include only them. The Albany Council occurred in August, and the Iroquois Confederacy debated about the Revolution from August 25 to August 31. The non-Iroquois present at the council consisted of important figures like Philip Schuyler, Oliver Wolcott, Turbutt Francis, Volkert Douw, Samuel Kirkland, and James Dean. The Iroquois at the council were representatives from all the tribes, but the Mohawk, Oneidas, and Tuscaroras had the most representatives. The Iroquois agreed with the Americans and decided at their Albany Council that they should remain as spectators to the conflict. A Mohawk Chief named Little Abraham declared that &quot;the determination of the Six Nations not to take any part; but as it is a family affair, to sit still and see you fight it out&quot;. Thus, the Iroquois chose to remain neutral for the time being. They felt it would be best to stand aside while the Colonists and the British battled. They did not wish to get caught up in this supposed &quot;family quarrel between [them] and Old England&quot;.

Despite this neutrality, the anti-Native American rhetoric of the Americans pushed the Iroquois over to the side of the British. The Americans put forth an extremely racist and divisive message. They viewed the Iroquois and other Native Americans as savages and lesser people. An example of this rhetoric came in the Declaration of Independence: &quot;the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.&quot; As a result of this terrible rhetoric, many Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondaga, and Seneca prepared to join the British. However, many Oneida and Tuscarora were able to be swayed by an American missionary, Samuel Kirkland. The Iroquois nation began to divide as the Revolution continued and, as a result, they extinguished the council fire that united the six Iroquois nations, therefore ending the Iroquois Confederacy. The Iroquois ended their political unity during the most turbulent time in their history. Two powers in the midst of battle pulled them apart to gain their skill as warriors. This divided the Iroquois and the tribes chose sides based on preference.

In addition to the push of American bigoted rhetoric, the British also continued to attempt to sway the Iroquois towards their side. One British attempt to sway the Iroquois was described by two Seneca tribesmen, Mary Jemison and Governor Blacksnake. They both described the grandeur of the lavish gifts that the British bestowed upon the Iroquois. Governor Blacksnake&#x27;s account held many details about the luxurious treatment that they received from the British: &quot;[I]mmediately after arrival the officers came to see us to See what wanted for to Support the Indians with Provisions and with the flood of Rum. they are Some of the ... warriors made use of this intoxicating Drinks, there was several Barrel Delivered to us for us to Drinked for the white man told us to Drinked as much as we want of it all free gratus, and the goods if any of us wishes to get for our own use.&quot; Contingent to this generosity was the loyalty of the Iroquois to the British. The Iroquois debated whether to side with the British or not. An argument to remain neutral until further development came from Governor Blacksnake&#x27;s uncle Cornplanter, but Joseph Brant twisted his recommendation to wait as a sign of cowardice. The British noticed that the Indian warriors were divided on the issue, so the British presented them with rum, bells, ostrich feathers, and a covenant belt. The Americans attempted a similar wine and dine method on the Tuscarora and Oneidas. In the end, the Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca sided with the British, and the Tuscarora and Oneida sided with the Americans. From this point on, the Iroquois would have a serious role in the American Revolution. The war divided them and now they would be fighting against each other from 1777 till the end on opposite sides.

==== Involvement in the American Revolution ====
The Seneca chose to side with the British in the American Revolution. One of the earliest battles the Iroquois were involved in occurred on August 6, 1777, in Oriskany During the Battle of Oriskany, Native Americans led a brutal attack against the rebel Americans where they &quot;killed, wounded, or captured the majority of patriot soldiers&quot;. The Seneca Governor Blacksnake described the battle from the viewpoint of the victorious Indians: &quot;as we approach to a firghting we had preparate to make one fire and Run amongst them we So, while we Doing it, feels no more to Kill the Beast, and killed most all, the americans army, only a few white man Escape from us ... there I have Seen the most Dead Bodies all it over that I neve Did see.&quot;

Author Ray Raphael made a connection between the Seneca warriors and Continental Army soldiers by noting that Blacksnake &quot;was not unlike&quot; known Revolutionary veterans &quot;Joseph Plumb Martin and James Collins and other white American [veterans] who could never finally resolve whether killing was right or wrong&quot;. As the war went on, many more brutal attacks and atrocities would be committed by both sides, notably the Sullivan Expedition, which devastated Iroquois and Seneca lands.

The Iroquois were involved in numerous other battles during the American Revolution. Notable raids like the Cherry Valley massacre and Battle of Minisink, were carefully planned raids on a trail laid out &quot;from the Susquehanna to the Delaware Valley and over the Pine Hill to the Esopus Country&quot;. In 1778 Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, and Mohawk warriors conducted raids on white settlements in the upper Susquehanna Valley. Although the Iroquois were active participants, Seneca like Governor Blacksnake were extremely fed up with the brutality of the war. He noted particularly on his behavior at Oriskany, and how he felt &quot;it was great sinfull by the sight of God&quot;.

Warriors like Blacksnake were feeling the mental toll of killing so many people during the American Revolution. As Raphael noted in his book, &quot;warfare had been much more personal&quot; for the Iroquois before the American Revolution. During the revolution, these once proud Iroquois were now reduced to conducting brutal acts such as the killing of women and children at the Cherry Valley massacre and the clubbing of surviving American soldiers at Oriskany. Although Seneca like Governor Blacksnake felt sorrow for their brutal actions, the Americans responded in a colder and more brutal fashion. This retaliation came in the Sullivan Expedition.

The planning of the Sullivan Expedition began in 1778 as a way to respond to the Iroquois victories and massacres. This plan came about from the complaints of New Yorkers at the Continental Congress. The New Yorkers had suffered from the massive Iroquois offensives from 1777 to 1778, and they wanted revenge. Besides the brutal battles described previously, the New Yorkers were especially concerned with Joseph Brant. Joseph Brant had Mohawk parents and British lineage, and at a young age, he was taken under the superintendent for Indian affairs.

Brant grew to be a courteous and well-spoken man, and he took up the fight for the British because of harassment and discrimination from the Americans during the lead-up to the American Revolution. Thus, Brant formed a military group known as Brant&#x27;s Volunteers, which consisted of Mohawks and Loyalists. Brant and his band of volunteers led many raids against hamlets and farms in New York, especially Tryon County. As a result of Brant&#x27;s exploits, the Iroquois offensives, and several massacres the Iroquois inflicted against colonial towns, in 1778 the Seneca and other western nations were attacked by United States forces as part of the Sullivan Expedition. George Washington called upon Continental Army General John Sullivan (general) to lead this attack upon the Iroquois. He had received anywhere from 3000 to 4500 soldiers to fight the Iroquois.

Overall, the Sullivan Expedition wreaked untold havoc and destruction upon the Iroquois lands, as the soldiers &quot;destroy[ed] not only the homes of the Iroquois but their food stocks as well&quot;. Seneca woman Mary Jemison recalled how the Continental soldiers &quot;destroyed every article of the food kind that they could lay their hands on&quot;. To make matters worse for the Iroquois, an especially hard winter in 1780 caused additional suffering for the downtrodden Iroquois. The Sullivan Expedition highlighted a period of true total war within the American Revolution. The Americans looked to cripple the Iroquois. They accomplished that, but they instilled a deep hatred in the Iroquois warriors.

After the Sullivan Expedition the recovered Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, and Mohawk, angered by the destruction caused, resumed their raids on American settlements in New York. These Iroquois tribes not only attacked and plundered the American colonists, they also set fire to Oneida and Tuscarora settlements. The Iroquois continued their attacks upon the Americans, even after General Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis had surrendered at Yorktown in 1781. They did not stop until their allies had caved in and surrendered. In 1782, the Iroquois had finally stopped fighting when the British General Frederick Haldimand recalled them &quot;pending the peace the negotiations in Paris&quot;.

The Iroquois also seemed to have a much larger knowledge of the war beyond the scope of New York. A letter from 1782 written by George Washington to John Hanson described intelligence captured from the British. In the letter, British soldiers encounter a group of Native Americans, and a discussion ensues. A soldier by the name of Campbell informs the Native Americans that the war ended and the Americans expressed their sorrow for the war. However, an unknown Seneca sachem informed the British &quot;that the Americans and [F]rench had beat the English, that the latter could no longer carry on the War, and that the Indians knew it well, and must now be sacrificed or submit to the Americans&quot;.

==== After the American Revolution ====
With the Iroquois League dissolved, the nation settled in new villages along Buffalo Creek, Tonawanda Creek, and Cattaraugus Creek in western New York. The Seneca, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Mohawk, as allies of the British, were required to cede all their lands in New York State at the end of the war, as Britain ceded its territory in the Thirteen Colonies to the new United States. The late-war Seneca settlements were assigned to them as their reservations after the Revolutionary War, as part of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1784. Although the Oneida and Tuscarora were allies of the rebels, they were also forced to give up most of their territory.

On July 8, 1788, the Seneca (along with some Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Cayuga tribes) sold rights to land east of the Genesee River in New York to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts.

On November 11, 1794, the Seneca (along with the other Haudenosaunee nations) signed the Treaty of Canandaigua with the United States, agreeing to peaceful relations. On September 15, 1797, at the Treaty of Big Tree, the Seneca sold their lands west of the Genesee River, retaining ten reservations for themselves. The sale opened up the rest of Western New York for settlement by European Americans. On January 15, 1838, the US and some Seneca leaders signed the Treaty of Buffalo Creek, by which the Seneca were to relocate to a tract of land west of the state of Missouri, but most refused to go.

The majority of the Seneca in New York formed a modern elected government, the Seneca Nation of Indians, in 1848. The Tonawanda Seneca Nation split off, choosing to keep a traditional form of tribal government. Both tribes are federally recognized in the United States.

==Seneca today==
While it is not known exactly how many Seneca there are, the three federally recognized tribes are the Seneca Nation of Indians and the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians in New York State and the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma. A fourth group of Seneca people reside in Canada, where many are part of Six Nations in Ontario.

Approximately 10,000 Seneca live near Lake Erie. About 7,800 people are citizens of the Seneca Nation of Indians. These members live or work on five reservations in New York: the Allegany (which contains the city of Salamanca); the Cattaraugus near Gowanda, New York; the Buffalo Creek Territory located in downtown Buffalo; the Niagara Falls Territory located in Niagara Falls, New York; and the Oil Springs Reservation, near Cuba. Few Seneca reside at the Oil Springs, Buffalo Creek, or Niagara territories due to the small amount of land at each. The last two territories are held and used specifically for the gaming casinos which the tribe has developed.

The Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians has about 1,200 citizens who live on their Tonawanda Reservation near Akron, New York.

The third federally recognized tribe is the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma who live near Miami, Oklahoma. They are descendants of Seneca and Cayuga who had migrated from New York into Ohio before the Revolutionary War, under pressure from European encroachment. They were removed to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River in the 1830s.

Many Seneca and other Iroquois migrated into Canada during and after the Revolutionary War, where the Crown gave them land in compensation for what was lost in their traditional territories. Some 10,000 to 25,000 Seneca are citizens of Six Nations Reserve and reside on the Grand River Territory, the major Iroquois reserve, near Brantford, Ontario.

Enrolled members of the Seneca Nation also live elsewhere in the United States; some moved to urban locations for work.

The Seneca language was rated &quot;critically endangered&quot; in 2007, with fewer than 50 fluent speakers, primarily the elderly. Efforts are currently underway to preserve and revitalize the language.

==Kinzua Dam displacement==
The federal government through the Corps of Engineers undertook a major project of a dam for flood control on the Allegheny River. The proposed project was planned to affect a major portion of Seneca territory in Pennsylvania and New York. Begun in 1960, construction of the Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River forced the relocation of approximately 600 Seneca from of land which they had occupied under the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua. They were relocated to Salamanca, near the northern shore of the Allegheny Reservoir that resulted from the flooding of land behind the dam. The Seneca had protested the plan for the project, filing suit in court and appealing to President John F. Kennedy to halt construction.

The Seneca lost their court case, and in 1961, citing the immediate need for flood control, Kennedy denied their request. This violation of Seneca rights, as well as those of many other Indian Nations, was memorialized in the 1960s by folksinger Peter La Farge, who wrote, &quot;As Long as the Grass Shall Grow&quot;. It was also sung by Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash.

==Leased land disputes==
The United States Senate has never ratified the treaty that New York made with the Iroquois nations, and only Congress has the right to make such treaties. In the late 20th century, several tribes filed suit in land claims, seeking to regain their traditional lands by having the treaty declared invalid. The Seneca had other issues with New York and had challenged some long-term leases in court.

The dispute centers around a set of 99–year leases that were granted by the Seneca in 1890 for lands that are now in the city of Salamanca and nearby villages. In 1990, Congress passed the Seneca Settlement Act to resolve the long-running land dispute. The Act required the state to pay compensation and to provide some lands. The households that refused to accept Seneca ownership, fifteen in all, were evicted from their homes. Then, in the early 2000s issues re-arose over Seneca use of settlement lands to establish casino gaming operations, which have generated considerable revenues for many tribes since the late 20th century.

==Grand Island claims==
On August 25, 1993, the Seneca filed suit in United States District Court to begin an action to reclaim land allegedly taken from it by New York without having gained required approval of the treaty by the US Senate. Only the US government has the constitutional power to make treaties with the Native American nations. The lands consisted of Grand Island and several smaller islands in the Niagara River. in November 1993, the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians moved to join the claim as a plaintiff and was granted standing as a plaintiff.

In 1998, the United States intervened in the lawsuits on behalf of the plaintiffs in the claim to allow the claim to proceed against New York. The state had asserted that it was immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. After extensive negotiations and pre-trial procedures, all parties to the claim moved for judgment as a matter of law.

By decision and order dated June 21, 2002, the trial court held that the Seneca ceded the subject lands to Great Britain in the 1764 treaties of peace after the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War). Thus, the disputed lands were no longer owned by the Seneca at the time of the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua. The court found that the state of New York&#x27;s &quot;purchase&quot; of the lands from the Seneca in 1815 was intended to avoid conflict with them, but it already owned it by virtue of Great Britain&#x27;s defeat in the Revolution and the cession of its lands to the United States and by default to the states in which the colonial lands were located.

The Seneca appealed the decision. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the trial court&#x27;s decision on September 9, 2004. The Seneca sought review of this decision by the US Supreme Court, which on June 5, 2006, announced that it declined to hear the case, which left the lower court rulings in place.

==Thruway claims==
On April 18, 2007, the Seneca Nation laid claim to a stretch of Interstate 90 that crosses the Cattaraugus Reservation for about three miles, in a section that runs on the northeast side of the lake from Erie, Pennsylvania to Buffalo, New York. They said that a 1954 agreement between the Seneca Nation and the New York State Thruway Authority, which granted the state permission to build the highway through their reservation in return for US$75,000, was invalid because it required federal approval. The lawsuit demands that some of the toll money collected by the Thruway Authority for the use of this three-mile stretch of the highway be remitted to the Nation. In 2011, Seneca President Robert Odawi Porter said that the Nation should be paid $1 every time a vehicle drives that part of the highway, amounting to tens of millions of dollars. The Nation also disputed the state&#x27;s attempts to collect cigarette taxes and casino revenue from tribal businesses operating within Seneca sovereign territory. , the lawsuit over the thruway was ongoing.

The Seneca had previously brought suit against the state on the issue of highway easements. The court in 1999 had ruled that the State could not be sued by the tribe. In Magistrate Heckman&#x27;s &quot;Report and Recommendation&quot;, it was noted that the State of New York asserted its immunity from suit against both counts of the complaint. One count was the Seneca Tribe&#x27;s challenge regarding the state&#x27;s acquisition of Grand Island and other smaller islands in the Niagara River, and the second count challenged the state&#x27;s thruway easement.

==Economy==

===Diversified businesses===
The Seneca have a diversified economy that relies on construction, communications, recreation, tourism, and retail sales. They have recently started operating two tribal-owned gaming casinos and recreation complexes.

Several large construction companies are located on the Cattaraugus and Allegany Territories. Many smaller construction companies are owned and operated by Seneca people. A considerable number of Seneca men work in some facet of the construction industry.

Recreation is one component of Seneca enterprises. The Highbanks Campground (reopened May 2015 after being closed in 2013) plays host to visitors in summer, as people take in the scenic vistas and enjoy the Allegheny Reservoir. Several thousand fishing licenses are sold each year to non-Seneca fishermen. Many of these customers are tourists to the region. Several major highways adjacent to or on the Seneca Nation Territories provide ready accessibility to local, regional and national traffic. Many tourists visit the region during the autumn for the fall foliage.

A substantial portion of the Seneca economy revolves around retail sales. From gas stations, smokeshops, and sports apparel, candles and artwork to traditional crafts, the wide range of products for sale on Seneca Nation Territories reflect the diverse interests of Seneca Nation citizens.

=== Seneca Medical Marijuana Initiative ===
According to Bill Wagner, an author writing for High Times, &quot;Members of the Seneca Nation of Indians in western New York state voted up a referendum Nov. 3 (2016) giving tribal leaders approval to move towards setting up a medical marijuana business on their territories. The measure passed by a vote of 448-364, giving the Seneca Nation Council the power to draft laws and regulations allowing the manufacture, use and distribution of cannabis for medical purposes. &quot;A decision on our Nation&#x27;s path of action on medical cannabis is far from made&quot;, cautioned Seneca President Maurice A. John Sr. in comments to the &quot;Buffalo News&quot;. &quot;But now, having heard from the Seneca people, our discussions and due diligence can begin in earnest.&quot; Entering the marijuana industry is thought to help stimulate the economy of the Seneca Tribe and create local business, dispensaries and other types of jobs involving medical marijuana.

===Tax-free gasoline and cigarette sales===
The price advantage of the Senecas&#x27; ability to sell tax-free gasoline and cigarettes has created a boom in their economy. They have established many service stations along the state highways that run through the reservations, as well as many internet cigarette stores. Competing business interests and the state government object to their sales over the Internet. The state of New York believes that the tribe&#x27;s sales of cigarettes by Internet are illegal. It also believes that the state has the authority to tax non-Indians who patronize Seneca businesses, a principle which the Seneca reject.

Seneca President Barry Snyder has defended the price advantage as an issue of sovereignty. Secondly, he has cited the Treaty of Canandaigua and Treaty of Buffalo Creek as the basis of Seneca exemption from collecting taxes on cigarettes to pay the state.

The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, Third Department had rejected this conclusion in 1994. The court held that the provisions of the treaty regarding taxation was only with regard to property taxes. The New York Court of Appeals on December 1, 1994, affirmed the lower court&#x27;s decision.

The Seneca have refused to extend these benefits and price advantages to non-Indians, in their own words &quot;has little sympathy for outsiders&quot; who desire to do so, They have tried to prosecute non-Indians who have attempted to claim the price advantages of the Seneca while operating a business on the reservation. Little Valley businessman Lloyd Long operated two Uni-Marts on the reservation which were owned by a Seneca woman. He was arrested after investigation by federal authorities at the behest of the Seneca Nation accusing the native woman of being a front for Long. In 2011 he was ordered by the court to pay more than one million dollars in restitution and serve five years on probation.

In 1997, New York State had attempted to enforce taxation on reservation sales of gasoline and cigarettes to non-Indians. Numerous Seneca had protested by setting fire to tires and cutting off traffic to Interstate 90 and New York State Route 17 (the future Interstate 86). Then Attorney General Eliot Spitzer attempted to cut off the Seneca Tribe&#x27;s internet cigarette sales by way of financial deplatforming. His office negotiated directly with credit card companies, tobacco companies, and delivery services to try to gain agreement to reject handling Seneca cigarette purchases by consumers. Another attempt at collecting taxes on gasoline and cigarettes sold to non-Indians was set to begin March 1, 2006; but it was tabled by the State Department of Taxation and Finance.

Shortly after March 1, 2006, other parties began proceedings to compel the State of New York to enforce its tax laws on sales to non-Indians on Indian land. Seneca County filed a suit which was dismissed. The New York State Association of Convenience Stores filed a similar suit, which was also dismissed. Based on the dismissal of these proceedings, Daniel Warren, a member and officer of Upstate Citizens for Equality, moved to vacate the judgment dismissing his 2002 state court action. The latter was dismissed because the court ruled that he had lack of standing.

In response to Governor Eliot Spitzer&#x27;s inclusion of $200 million of revenue in his budget from the cigarette tax, the Seneca announced plans to collect a toll from all who travel the length of I-90 that goes through their reservation. In 2007 the Senecas rescinded the agreement that had permitted construction of the thruway and its attendant easement through their reservation. Some commentators have contended that this agreement was not necessary or moot because the United States was already granted free right-of-passage across the Seneca land in the Treaty of Canandaigua.

In 2008 Governor David Paterson included $62 million of revenue in his budget from the proposed collection of these taxes. He signed a new law requiring that manufacturers and wholesalers swear under penalty of perjury that they are not selling untaxed cigarettes in New York.

A law to bar any tax-exempt organization in New York from receiving tax-free cigarettes went into effect June 21, 2011. The Seneca nation has repeatedly appealed the decision, continuing to do so as of June 2011, but has not gained an overturn of this law. The state has enforced the law only on cigarette brands produced by non-Indian companies (including all major national brands). It has not attempted to collect taxes on brands that are entirely tribally produced and sold (these are generally lower-end and lower-cost brands that have always made up the majority of Seneca cigarette sales.)

===Casinos===
As states struggled to raise revenues, in the 1980s, some state legislatures prohibited state-sponsored gambling by authorizing state lotteries and other games of chance as a means to raise funds. In some cases, funds from such operations were earmarked for education or other worthy goals. Native American tribes asserted their right to run similar activities. With the US Supreme Court decision ruling in the late 1980s that federally recognized Native American tribes could establish gaming on their sovereign reservations, the Seneca Nation began to develop its gambling industry. It began, as states and other tribes did, with bingo.

In 2002, the Seneca Nation of Indians signed a Gaming Compact with the State of New York to cooperate in the establishment of three class III gambling facilities (casinos). It established the Seneca Gaming Corporation to manage its operations. The Seneca Nation of Indians owns and operates two casinos on its territory in New York State: one in Niagara Falls called Seneca Niagara which also reopened in online format during the pandemic and the other in Salamanca, called Seneca Allegany.

Construction began on a third, the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino, in downtown Buffalo. In 2007 the Seneca opened a temporary casino on its land in Buffalo after federal approval, to satisfy its agreement with the state, and moved to a permanent building in 2013. Some citizens have opposed all Indian gambling, but especially the Buffalo location. Additional controversy has been engendered because there were questions about whether the Seneca-controlled land met other status criteria for gambling as defined in the IGRA.

Some civic groups, including a &quot;broad coalition of Buffalo&#x27;s political, business, and cultural leaders&quot;, have opposed the Seneca Nation&#x27;s establishment of a casino in Buffalo. They believe the operations will adversely affect the economic and social environment of the already struggling city. Opponents include the Upstate Citizens for Equality and Citizens for a Better Buffalo. In 2008 they won a lawsuit challenging the legality of the proposed casino in Buffalo, because of the status of the land. It was not part of their original reservations but had been transferred in a settlement with the state.

On July 8, 2008, United States District Judge William M. Skretny issued a decision holding that the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino is not on gaming-eligible lands. The National Indian Gaming Commission is reviewing proposed Seneca regulations and weighing its appeal options. The Seneca were given five days to respond or to face fines and a forced shutdown. They said they refuse to comply with the commission&#x27;s order and will appeal.

Given the declining economic situation because of a nationwide recession, in summer 2008 the Seneca halted construction on the new casino in Buffalo. In December 2008 they laid off 210 employees from the three casinos.

===Broadcasting===
The nation has established an official broadcasting arm, &quot;Seneca Broadcasting&quot;, to apply for and purchase radio station licenses. The company owned one commercial FM radio station (broadcasting at 105.9 MHz) licensed off-reservation to the village of Little Valley, which the company purchased from Randy Michaels in early 2009. That station, known as WGWE, signed on February 1, 2010, from studios in the city of Salamanca with a classic hits format and was owned and operated by the nation until its sale in December 2021. An earlier application, for a noncommercial FM station at 89.3 in Irving, New York, ran into mutual exclusivity problems with out-of-town religious broadcasters.

===Employment===
Many Seneca people are employed in the local economy of the region as professionals, including lawyers, professors, physicians, police officers, teachers, social workers, nurses, and managers .

<text>The Missoula floods (also known as the Spokane floods, the Bretz floods, or Bretz&#x27;s floods) were cataclysmic glacial lake outburst floods that swept periodically across eastern Washington and down the Columbia River Gorge at the end of the last ice age. These floods were the result of periodic sudden ruptures of the ice dam on the Clark Fork River that created Glacial Lake Missoula. After each ice dam rupture, the waters of the lake would rush down the Clark Fork and the Columbia River, flooding much of eastern Washington and the Willamette Valley in western Oregon. After the lake drained, the ice would reform, creating Glacial Lake Missoula again.

These floods have been researched since the 1920s. During the last deglaciation that followed the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, geologists estimate that a cycle of flooding and reformation of the lake lasted an average of 55 years and that the floods occurred dozens of times over the 2,000 years between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago. U.S. Geological Survey hydrologist Jim O&#x27;Connor and Spain&#x27;s Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales scientist Gerardo Benito have found evidence of at least twenty-five massive floods, the largest discharging about 10 cubic kilometers per hour (2.7 million m³/s, 13 times that of the Amazon River). Alternate estimates for the peak flow rate of the largest flood range up to 17 cubic kilometers per hour. The maximum flow speed approached 36 meters/second (130 km/h or 80 mph).

Within the Columbia River drainage basin, detailed investigation of the Missoula floods&#x27; glaciofluvial deposits, informally known as the &quot;Hanford formation&quot;, has documented the presence of Middle and Early Pleistocene Missoula flood deposits within the Othello Channels, Columbia River Gorge, Channeled Scabland, Quincy Basin, Pasco Basin, and the Walla Walla Valley. Based on the presence of multiple interglacial calcretes interbedded with flood deposits, magnetostratigraphy, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and unconformity truncated clastic dikes, it has been estimated that the oldest of the Pleistocene Missoula floods happened before 1.5 million years ago. Because of the fragmentary nature of older glaciofluvial deposits, which have been largely removed by subsequent Missoula floods, within the Hanford formation, the exact number of older Missoula floods, which are known as &quot;ancient cataclysmic floods&quot;, that occurred during the Pleistocene cannot be estimated with any confidence.

==Flood hypothesis proposed==

Geologist J Harlen Bretz first recognized evidence of the catastrophic floods, which he called the &quot;Spokane floods&quot;, in the 1920s. He was researching the Channeled Scablands in Eastern Washington, the Columbia Gorge, and the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Beginning In the summer of 1922, Bretz conducted field research on the Columbia River Plateau for the next seven years. He had been interested in unusual erosion features in the area since 1910 after seeing a newly published topographic map of the Potholes Cataract. Bretz coined the term Channeled Scablands in 1923 to refer to the area near the Grand Coulee, where massive erosion had cut through basalt deposits. Bretz published a paper in 1923 arguing that the Channeled Scablands in Eastern Washington were caused by massive flooding in the distant past.

Bretz&#x27;s view, which was seen as arguing for a catastrophic explanation of the geology, ran against the prevailing view of uniformitarianism, and Bretz&#x27;s views were initially disregarded. The Geological Society of Washington, D.C, invited the young Bretz to present his previously published research at a January 12, 1927, meeting where several other geologists presented competing theories. Another geologist at the meeting, J.T. Pardee, had worked with Bretz and had evidence of an ancient glacial lake that lent credence to Bretz&#x27;s theories. Bretz defended his theories, which kicked off an acrimonious 40-year debate over the origin of the Scablands. Both Pardee and Bretz continued their research over the next 30 years, collecting and analyzing evidence that led them to identify Lake Missoula as the source of the Spokane flood and creator of the channeled scablands.

After Pardee studied the canyon of the Flathead River, he estimated that flood waters above would be required to roll the largest of the boulders moved by the flood. He estimated the water flow was , more than the combined flow of every river in the world. More recent estimates place the flow rate at &quot;ten times&quot; the flow of all current rivers combined.

The Missoula floods have also been referred to as the &quot;Bretz floods&quot; in honor of Bretz.

==Flood initiation==

The Cordilleran ice sheet formed a glacial dam across the Clark Fork valley, creating a large lake just south of modern-day Sandpoint. Repeated failures of this dam triggered jökulhlaups, a type of glacial outburst flood. The exact cause of these failures is disputed. &quot;Cataclysms on the Columbia: The Great Missoula Floods&quot; suggests that the ice dam may have floated by the lake, allowing water to flow underneath and disintegrate the dam. A 2020 review article found that either overtopping or tunneling, possibly accompanied by thermal erosion, caused the dam to fail.

==Flood events==
As the water emerged from the Columbia River gorge, it backed up again at the wide narrows near Kalama, Washington. Some temporary lakes rose to an elevation of more than , flooding the Willamette Valley to Eugene, Oregon and beyond. Iceberg-rafted glacial erratics and erosion features are evidence of these events. Lake-bottom sediments deposited by the floods have contributed to the agricultural richness of the Willamette and Columbia Valleys. Glacial deposits overlaid with centuries of windblown sediments (loess) have scattered steep, southerly sloping dunes throughout the Columbia Valley, ideal conditions for orchard and vineyard development at higher latitudes.

After analysis and controversy, geologists now believe that there were 40 or more separate floods, although the exact source of the water is still being debated. The peak flow of the floods is estimated to be 27 cubic kilometers per hour (6.5 cubic miles per hour). The maximum flow speed approached 36 meters/second (130 km/h or 80 mph). Up to 1.9×1019 joules of potential energy were released by each flood (the equivalent of 4,500 megatons of TNT). For comparison, this is 90 times more powerful than the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated, the 50-megaton &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot;. The cumulative effect of the floods was to excavate of loess, sediment, and basalt from the Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington and to transport it downstream.

===Multiple flood hypothesis===

The multiple flood hypothesis was first proposed by R.B. Waitt Jr. in 1980. Waitt argued for a sequence of 40 or more floods. Waitt&#x27;s proposal was based mainly on analysis from glacial lake bottom deposits in Ninemile Creek and the flood deposits in Burlingame Canyon. His most compelling argument for separate floods was that the Touchet bed deposits from two successive floods were found to be separated by two layers of volcanic ash (tephra), with the ash separated by a fine layer of windblown dust deposits, located in a thin layer between sediment layers ten rhythmites below the top of the Touchet beds. The two layers of volcanic ash are separated by of airborne nonvolcanic silt. The tephra is Mount St. Helens ash that fell in Eastern Washington. By analogy, since there were 40 layers with comparable characteristics at Burlingame Canyon, Waitt argued they all could be considered to have similar separation in deposition time.

===Controversy over the number and source of floods===
The controversy about whether the Channeled Scabland landforms were formed mainly by multiple periodic floods or by a single grand-scale cataclysmic flood from late Pleistocene Glacial Lake Missoula or an unidentified Canadian source continued through 1999. Shaw&#x27;s team of geologists reviewed the sedimentary sequences of the Touchet beds and concluded that the sequences do not automatically imply multiple floods separated by decades or centuries. Rather, they proposed that sedimentation in the Glacial Lake Missoula basin resulted from jökulhlaups draining into Lake Missoula from British Columbia to the north. Further, Shaw&#x27;s team proposed the scabland flooding might have partially originated from an enormous subglacial reservoir that extended over much of central British Columbia, particularly including the Rocky Mountain Trench, which may have discharged by several paths, including one through Lake Missoula. This discharge, if occurring concurrently with the breach of the Lake Missoula ice dam, would have provided significantly larger volumes of water. Further, Shaw and the team proposed that the rhythmic Touchet beds result from multiple pulses or surges within a larger flood.

In 2000, a team led by Komatsu simulated the floods numerically with a 3-dimensional hydraulic model. They based the Glacial Lake Missoula discharge rate on the rate predicted for the Spokane Valley–Rathdrum Prairie immediately downstream of Glacial Lake Missoula, for which several previous estimates had placed the maximum discharge of 17 × 106m3/s and the total amount of water discharged equal to the maximum estimated volume of Lake Missoula (2184 km3). Neglecting erosion effects, their simulated water flow was based on modern-day topography. Their major findings were that the calculated water depth in each flooded location except for the Spokane Valley–Rathdrum Prairie was shallower than the field evidence showed. For example, their calculated water depth at the Pasco Basin–Wallula Gap transition zone is about 190 m, significantly less than the 280–300 m flood depth indicated by high-water marks. They concluded that a flood of ~106m3/s could not have made the observed high-water marks.

In a comment on the Komatsu analysis, Brian Atwater and colleagues observed substantial evidence for multiple large floods, including mud cracks and animal burrows in lower layers, which were filled by sediment from later floods. Further, evidence for multiple flood flows up sidearms of Glacial Lake Columbia spread over many centuries has been found. They also pointed out that the discharge point from Lake Columbia varied with time, originally flowing across the Waterville Plateau into Moses Coulee, but later, when the Okanagan lobe blocked that route, eroding the Grand Coulee to discharge there as a substantially lower outlet. The Komatsu analysis does not evaluate the impact of the considerable erosion observed in this basin during the flood or floods. However, the assumption that flood hydraulics can be modeled using modern-day topography is an area that warrants further consideration. Earlier narrower constrictions at places such as Wallula Gap and through the Columbia Gorge would be expected to produce higher flow resistance and correspondingly higher floods.

===The current understanding===
The dating for Waitt&#x27;s proposed separation of layers into sequential floods has been supported by subsequent paleomagnetism studies, which support a 30–40 year interval between depositions of Mount St. Helens&#x27; ash, and hence flood events, but do not preclude an up to 60-year interval. Offshore deposits on the bed of the Pacific at the mouth of the Columbia River include 120 meters of material deposited over a several thousand-year period corresponding to multiple scabland floods seen in the Touchet Beds. Based on Waitt&#x27;s identification of 40 floods, this would give an average separation between floods of 50 years.

<doc id="441574" wikidata="Q311488" url="?curid=441574" title="Khorloogiin Choibalsan">
<text>Khorloogiin Choibalsan (8 February 1895 – 26 January 1952) was a Mongolian politician who served as the leader of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic as the chairman of the Council of Ministers (premier) from 1939 until his death in 1952. He was also the commander-in-chief of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Army from 1937, and the chairman of the Presidium of the State Little Khural (head of state) from 1929 to 1930. His rule was maintained by a repressive state and cult of personality. Choibalsan led a dictatorship and organized Stalinist purges in Mongolia between 1937 and 1939 as head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Choibalsan was one of the 1921 Mongolian revolutionaries and held several political and military roles in the 1920s. Mongolia&#x27;s economic, political, and military ties to the Soviet Union deepened, though after World War II, Choibalsan supported pan-Mongolian unification with Inner Mongolia. He died of cancer in Moscow in 1952 and was succeeded as leader by his protégé, Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal.

==Early life==
Choibalsan was born on 8 February 1895 in Achit Beysiyn, near present-day Choibalsan, Dornod Province. He was the youngest of four children born to a poor, unmarried herdswoman named Khorloo (the name Khorloogiin is a matronymic). His father was likely a Barga tribesman, Daur Mongol from Inner Mongolia called Jamsu, but Choibalsan claimed to be unaware of his identity. 

Named Dugar at birth, he assumed the religious name Choibalsan at age 13 after entering the local Buddhist monastery of San Beysiyn Khüree, where he trained to be a Lamaist monk. Five years later he and another novice fled to Khüree (also known as Urga—present-day Ulaanbaatar), where he worked odd jobs. In part to prevent him from being returned to the monastery, a sympathetic Buryat teacher named Nikolai Danchinov had him enrolled in the Russian consulate&#x27;s Russian-Mongolian Translators&#x27; School. A year later he was sent on, at public expense, to study at a gymnasium in Irkutsk, Russia from 1914 to 1917.

==Mongolian Revolution of 1921==
===Formation of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party===
Choibalsan and fellow Mongolian students in Russia were called back to Khüree by the Bogd Khaan government following the 1917 October Revolution. Exposed to Bolshevism while living among Irkutsk&#x27;s radicalized student population, Choibalsan joined the revolutionary Consular Hill or Konsulyn Denj (&quot;Консулын дэнж&quot;) group, heavily influenced by Bolshevist philosophy and established to resist the Chinese occupation of Outer Mongolia after 1919. Original members of the group also included Dambyn Chagdarjav and Darizavyn Losol. 

Dogsomyn Bodoo, the group&#x27;s leader, was a former teacher and mentor of Choibalsan&#x27;s at the Russian-Mongolian School for Translators. With his serviceable Russian, Choibalsan served as the group&#x27;s translator with contacts at the Russian Consulate. Those contacts later encouraged Konsulyn Denj to join forces with the more nationalist-oriented resistance group Züün Khüree (East Khüree), which counted Soliin Danzan, Dansrabilegiin Dogsom, and Damdin Sükhbaatar among its members. On 25 June 1920, the new body adopted the name Mongolian People&#x27;s Party (MPP). In 1924 the party renamed itself the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party, or MPRP, after the death of the Bogd Khaan and the formal proclamation of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic (MPR).

===Contact with Soviets and the first MPP Congress===
In late June 1920, Choibalsan and Danzan embarked for Irkutsk (they were later joined by Losol, Chagdarjav, Dogsom, L. Dendev, and Sükhbaatar—the famous &quot;First Seven&quot;) to establish contacts with the Soviets and seek assistance in their struggle for independence. Choibalsan and Sükhbaatar remained together in Irkutsk for several months raising awareness of Mongolia&#x27;s plight and receiving military training. During this period Sükhbaatar gradually became a second mentor to Choibalsan.

While the group of seven continued their lobbying efforts in Soviet Russia, forces commanded by the anti-Bolshevik Russian warlord Roman von Ungern-Sternberg invaded Mongolia from the east and ejected occupying Chinese garrisons from Khüree in February 1921. No longer faced with directly confronting the Chinese in Mongolia, the Soviets finally threw their backing behind the Mongolian revolutionaries. Choibalsan and Sükhbaatar relocated to Troitskosavsk (modern-day Kyakhta on the Russian-Mongolian border) to coordinate revolutionary activities and recruit Mongolian fighters. Choibalsan secretly ventured as far as Khüree to consult with MPP supporters, enlist fighters, and spirit members of Sükhbaatar&#x27;s family back to Troitskosavsk.

At a Soviet-organized MPP conference held secretly in Troitskosavsk from 1 to 3 March 1921 (subsequently regarded as the first congress of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party), Choibalsan was elected a member of the provisional revolutionary government. He was also appointed Political Commissar (Deputy Chief and chief propagandist) of the &quot;Mongol Ardyn Huv&#x27;sgalt Tsereg&quot; (Mongolian: &quot;Монгол Ардын Хувьсгалт Цэрэг&quot;), or the Mongolian People&#x27;s Army, commanded by Sükhbaatar.

===Defeat of Ungern-Sternberg===
Within days, Sükhbaatar&#x27;s Mongolian partisan army (now numbering 400 men) defeated the larger but demoralized Chinese garrison that had fled to Kyakhta Maimaicheng (modern-day Altanbulag). Joint Mongol and Red Army forces directly confronted Ungern&#x27;s troops in a series of battles near Troitskosavsk from late May to mid-June. Choibalsan took command of a Mongolian detachment based in Tariat, in modern-day Arkhangai province and, together with the Russian forces commanded by Petr Efimovich Shchetinkin, fought right guard actions in western Mongolia in support of the main Russian-Mongolian advance through modern-day Selenge and Töv provinces. 

After small skirmishes with Ungern&#x27;s remaining guard units, the joint Russian-Mongol force entered Khüree unchallenged on 6 July 1921. Choibalsan pursued remnants of Ungern&#x27;s army and was likely on hand at Ungern&#x27;s capture by Shchetinkin on 22 August 1921.

==Rise to power==
After the revolution, Choibalsan remained Deputy Chief of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Army, while also being elected Chairman of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League (MRYL). Despite his credentials as one of the MPP&#x27;s founding members, he failed to advance beyond second-tier government posts throughout the 1920s. His heavy drinking, womanizing, and violent temperament alienated him from party leaders and at one point in the early 1930s he was temporarily demoted from being Minister of Foreign Affairs to the role of simple Museum Director. 

While he often gravitated towards the leftist faction of the party, he was suspected of being a rightist in what little mention is made of him in Soviet and Mongolian reports of the era. Choibalsan himself did not include many of his own speeches from this period in his collected works, indicating his role during this period was not a prominent one. It was not until members of the Soviet security apparatus such as Soviet Commissar for Defense Kliment Voroshilov took note of Choibalsan&#x27;s political usefulness in the late 1920s and early 1930s that his career prospects began to improve.

===Purge of Bodoo===
In late 1921, Choibalsan&#x27;s MRYL foot soldiers carried out Prime Minister Bodoo&#x27;s modernization campaign of forcibly cutting off &quot;feudal&quot; ornaments from Mongolian clothing (large cuffs, women&#x27;s jewelry, long hair etc.). The angry public backlash led to Bodoo&#x27;s purge and eventual execution in August 1922, while Choibalsan was stripped of both full party membership and his position as deputy commander of the Mongolian military. Only Sükhbaatar&#x27;s intervention saved him from Bodoo&#x27;s fate. 

Choibalsan was sent to a Moscow Russian Military Academy after Sükhbaatar&#x27;s death in 1923. When he returned to Ulaanbaatar a year later was offered his old mentor&#x27;s former position as Commander in Chief of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Troops. He also held positions as a member of the Presidium of the State Great Khural from 1924 to 1928 and as a member of the MPRP Central Committee.

===Right Opportunism (1925–28)===
At the Third Party Congress in 1924, Choibalsan sided with the leftist leader Rinchingiin Elbegdorj as left and right-wing factions of the MPRP called for the arrest and execution of moderate party leader Danzan, who was accused of protecting bourgeois interests and engaging in business with Chinese firms. Following Danzan&#x27;s death, Choibalsan and Rinchino&#x27;s political influence diminished as the party&#x27;s right-wing, led by Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj, assumed control.

===Leftist Period 1928–1932===
The rise of Josef Stalin and termination of Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy influenced political developments in the MPR with the 1928 MPRP Seventh Party Congress ushering in the &quot;Leftist Period.&quot; Soviet advisors arranged for Choibalsan to be &quot;kicked upstairs&quot; to be Chairman of the Little Hural (i.e. titular head of state) from where, in 1929 and 1930, he supported implementation of Soviet-backed leftist policies of more rapid collectivization, land expropriation, and persecution of the Buddhist faith.

At the Eighth Party Congress in 1930 Choibalsan contributed to a ramping up of leftist socialist reforms when, again encouraged by Soviet agents, he introduced personally formulated decrees that intensified land confiscation and forced collectivization measures. His appointment in 1931 as Minister of Livestock and Agriculture (a position he held until 1935) gave him even greater authority to enforce the policies. Traditional herders were forced off the steppe and into badly managed collective farms, destroying one third of Mongolian livestock. Over 800 properties belonging to the nobility and the Buddhist faith were confiscated and over 700 head of mostly noble households were executed. Under Stalinist influence in the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, an estimated 17,000 monks were killed, official figures show.

The government&#x27;s aggressive measures ultimately lead to brutal armed uprisings in Khövsgöl, Arkhangai, Övörkhangai, and Zavkhan provinces in 1932. In reaction, Moscow ordered a temporary curtailment of economic centralization efforts. Comintern agents counted on Choibalsan to be a strong advocate for its New Turn policy to correct the &quot;excesses&quot; of &quot;the Left Deviation&quot; when it was introduced in an extraordinary plenum of the MPRP Central Committee in June 1932. Later MPR histories would credit Choibalsan with being the first to criticize the leftist period and propose reforms, but these were mere fabrications meant to build up Choibalsan&#x27;s cult of personality.

===Lkhümbe Affair===
The invasion of neighboring Manchuria by Japanese forces in 1931 had raised fears in Ulaanbaatar and Moscow alike of possible Japanese military expansion into Mongolia and the Soviet Far East. In the summer of 1934, Choibalsan&#x27;s name surfaced during interrogations of party members arrested as part of the &quot;Lkhümbe Affair,&quot; a manufactured conspiracy in which MPRP General Secretary Jambyn Lkhümbe and other MPRP elements, particularly Buryat-Mongols, were falsely accused of conspiring with Japanese spies. Over 1,500 people were implicated in the purge and 56 were executed. 

Choibalsan was called to Moscow, where he was arrested and interrogated regarding his possible involvement. Within days, however, he was cooperating with the NKVD in the interrogation and torture of fellow Mongolians. Satisfied with his loyalty, Stalin ordered Mongolia&#x27;s Prime Minister Peljidiin Genden to appoint Choibalsan as deputy prime minister. 

Genden vigorously objected, but to no avail. As relations between Genden and Stalin soured, Choibalsan&#x27;s influence with Moscow increased. In 1935, as a public sign of his favor, Stalin bestowed 20 GAZ automobiles on Choibalsan, who then distributed them among Mongolian power players to increase his prestige.

==Great Terror==
===Purge of Genden===
In 1936 Choibalsan and Gelegdorjiin Demid were appointed Marshals of the Armed Forces while Choibalsan also became head of the newly elevated Ministry of Internal Affairs, 26 percent of whose staff were NKVD agents. Acting under Moscow&#x27;s directive, Choibalsan then had Genden purged in March 1936 for sabotaging Mongol-Soviet relations by rejecting Stalin&#x27;s demand that he eliminate the country&#x27;s Buddhist clergy. Genden was removed from his offices of the prime minister and foreign minister, arrested, and sent to Moscow, where he was executed a year later. Anandyn Amar became Prime Minister in his place. 

Over the next three years, Soviet mentors in the Ministry of Internal Affairs guided Choibalsan in planning and carrying out the &quot;Great Terror&quot;. Possibly advised by a Soviet Official, Chopyak, Choibalsan had Internal Affairs Committee rules amended in May 1936 to facilitate the detention of high ranking politicians without first consulting political superiors. 

Soon thereafter 23 high ranking lamas were arrested for participating in a &quot;counter revolutionary centre&quot;. Following a yearlong trial, they were publicly executed in early October 1937. When Mongolia&#x27;s Procurator General protested the lamas&#x27; prosecution, he too was arrested and then shot.

===Death of Marshal Demid===
In August 1937, the 36-year-old Marshal Demid, whose popularity Choibalsan had always resented, died under suspicious circumstances, resulting in Choibalsan&#x27;s promotion to the dual role of sole Commander-in-Chief of the Mongolian military and Minister of Defense. The following day Choibalsan, as Interior Minister, issued Order 366 which declared that many in Mongolia &quot;had fallen under the influence of Japanese spies and provocateurs.&quot; 

That same month Stalin, alarmed by Japanese military movements in Manchuria ordered the stationing of 30,000 Red Army troops in Mongolia and dispatched a large Soviet delegation to Ulaanbaatar under Soviet Deputy NKVD Commissar Mikhail Frinovsky. Frinovsky was charged with setting in motion the violent purges that he had so effectively carried out in the Soviet Union under NKVD Chief Nikolai Yezhov. Working through Soviet advisers already embedded within the Ministry of Interior and with a willing Choibalsan providing symbolic cover, Frinovsky built the purge framework from behind the scenes, producing arrest lists and creating an NKVD style Troika (headed by Choibalsan) to try suspects.

===10 September 1937===
The arrest of 65 high ranking government officials and intelligentsia on the night of 10 September 1937 signaled the launch of the purges in earnest. All were accused of spying for Japan as part of a Genden-Demid plot and most confessed under intense torture. The first show trial was staged at the Central Theatre from 18 to 20 October 1937. Thirteen of the 14 persons accused were sentenced to death.

In a spasm of violence that lasted nearly 18 months, Choibalsan&#x27;s troika approved and carried out the execution of over 17,000 lamas accused of counterrevolutionary activities. Monks who were not executed were forcibly laicized while 746 of the country&#x27;s monasteries were liquidated. Thousands more dissident intellectuals, political and government officials labelled &quot;enemies of the revolution,&quot; as well as ethnic Buryats and Kazakhs, were also rounded up and killed. Twenty-five persons from top positions in the party and government, 187 from the military leadership, and 36 of the 51 members of the Central Committee were executed. Following the Russian model, Choibalsan opened gulags in the countryside to imprison dissidents. 

While the NKVD effectively managed the purge by staging show trials and carrying out executions, a frequently intoxicated Choibalsan was sometimes present during torture and interrogations of suspected counterrevolutionaries, including old friends and comrades. Choibalsan rubber-stamped NKVD execution orders and at times personally directed executions. He also added names of political enemies to NKVD arrest lists simply to settle old scores.

===End of the Great Terror===

Racked with stress, Choibalsan spent six months (August 1938 – January 1939) recuperating and consulting with Voroshilov, Yezhov, and Stalin in Moscow and Sochi while NKVD agents and Interior Ministry officials carried on purge operations from Ulaanbaatar. When he returned to Mongolia, Choibalsan followed Soviet directives and had the highly popular Prime Minister Amar purged. Choibalsan claimed he &quot;had helped anti-government plotters, opposed their arrest, and neglected the defense of the borders. He betrayed his own country and was a traitor to the revolution&quot;. After a coordinated propaganda campaign, Amar was arrested on 7 March 1939 and sent to the USSR, where he was later tried by a Soviet Troika and executed.

With Amar&#x27;s removal, Choibalsan became Mongolia&#x27;s uncontested leader, simultaneously holding the offices of Prime Minister, Minister for Internal Affairs, Minister of War, and Commander in Chief of the Mongolian armed forces. Secure in his position, Choibalsan brought the terror to an end in April 1939 by declaring that the excesses of the purges had been conducted by overzealous party officials while he was away in the USSR, but that he had overseen the arrests of the real criminals. Official blame for the purges fell on the deputy minister of internal affairs Nasantogtoh, and his former Soviet handler Kichikov. Later, other henchmen of the purge were arrested and executed, including Luvsansharav, Bayasgalan, Dashtseveg, and Luvsandorj. 

Dogsom and Losol, the last two living members (besides Choibalsan himself) of the original seven founding members of the MPRP, were also arrested. Dogsom was executed in 1941. Losol died in a Soviet prison before his case came to trial.

==World War II (1939–45)==
=== Battles of Khalkhin Gol ===


In the spring of 1939, Japanese Kwantung Army military leaders moved to test the resolve of the Soviet and Mongolian militaries to protect disputed territory along Mongolia&#x27;s southeast border with Japanese occupied Manchuria. Over the course of three battles (May – September 1939) a heavily armoured Soviet military force commanded by Georgy Zhukov decisively defeated the Japanese advance near the village of Nomonhan. There were nearly 8,000 casualties for both the Soviet and Japanese forces. Nevertheless, the victory, which took place close to his birthplace, helped cement Choibalsan&#x27;s growing cult of personality which portrayed him as a staunch defender of Mongolian independence against imperialist Japanese aggression.

===Support for the Soviet Union===
Choibalsan proclaimed his country&#x27;s unwavering support for the Soviet Union after Germany&#x27;s invasion of the USSR in June 1941, although Mongolia never officially declared war against Germany and waited until August 1945 to declare war against Japan. As early as 1939, Stalin had pushed Choibalsan to increase Mongolia&#x27;s livestock population to 200 million as a source of raw materials for the Soviet Union in the event of war in Europe. Throughout the conflict, the MPR&#x27;s economy was re-calibrated to provide material support to the Soviet Union in the form of livestock, raw materials, money, food, military clothing, meat, sheepskin, felt boots, fur-lined coats, and funding for several Soviet military units. Choibalsan and the newly elected Secretary General of the MPRP Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal traveled to the front near Moscow to distribute gifts to Red Army troops. Stalin awarded Choibalsan the Order of Lenin for his outstanding effort in organizing the Mongolian economy for the delivery of aid in goods to Red Army in July 1944.

===Internal developments===
Despite the privations of wartime, Choibalsan and party leaders pressed on with what limited social progress they could manage while delivering much of the country&#x27;s economic output to the Soviets. Choibalsan consistently sought Moscow&#x27;s assent before making key policy decisions, even in minor matters, and made efforts to curry Moscow&#x27;s favour whenever possible. At the Tenth Party Congress in March to April 1940, Choibalsan arranged the purge of MPRP Secretary-General Baasanjav and had him replaced with a new favorite of Stalin&#x27;s, 24-year-old Minister of Finance Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal. 

Although he relinquished leadership of the MPRP, Choibalsan continued to be the predominant force in Mongolian politics and pushed through reforms of the Mongolian constitution more in line with the 1936 USSR Constitution that effectively ended the influence and power of Buddhist church. Between 1941 and 1946 the country adopted Cyrillic script in place of the traditional Mongolian script. On 5 October 1942 Choibalsan University in Ulaanbaatar opened financed largely by the Soviets and with courses taught in Russian.

===End of the war and pan-Mongolian aspirations===

An ardent Mongolian nationalist, Choibalsan never gave up a hope of uniting all of the Mongols under the auspices of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic. Until 1945 he had encouraged an ethnic insurgency in Eastern Xinjiang (with Stalin&#x27;s support), looking to strengthen the MPR&#x27;s influence in the region and possibly beyond to Gansu and Qinghai. He saw the impending defeat of Japan as an opportunity to realize his long-held dream of a &quot;Great Mongolia&quot;, the uniting of Outer and Inner Mongolia, and he fully expected Stalin&#x27;s backing as a reward for Mongolia&#x27;s steadfast support of the Soviets during the war. 

On 10 August 1945, Mongolia declared war on Japan two days after the Soviet Union and both armies joined forces to attack Japanese strongholds in northern China during the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. At the same time, Choibalsan unleashed a brief wave of pan-Mongolist nationalism through the press, calling for unification and encouraging a grassroots pan-Mongolist movement in Inner Mongolia. When Choibalsan ordered Mongolian troops to move south of the Great Wall as far as Zhangjiakou, Chengde and Batu-Khaalga, he was ordered by an angry Stalin to call them back. Conversely, it also marked greater Mongolia&#x27;s permanent division into an independent Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic and a neighboring Inner Mongolia.

==Post war==
===Modernisation efforts===
With the end of the war, Mongolia embarked on a policy of &quot;construction of the foundations of socialism.&quot; Proclaiming it &quot;necessary to exterminate the concept of property,&quot; Choibalsan looked to modernize the country based on the Soviet model while expanding the communal agriculture sector. Funded largely through Soviet aid, the country&#x27;s first five-year plan (1948–1952) focused on economic development, infrastructure construction, and doubling the country&#x27;s livestock. Initiatives also were taken to redevelop the agrarian, industrial, and transportation sectors, to establish modern mining, and improve education and health services. Furthermore, the Choibalsan-led MPRP introduced modern medicine, brought about almost universal literacy, and cultivated widespread industrialization that led to greatly improved standards of living. Under his government the Nalaikh Coal Mine, the electric grid, the Züün Bayan petroleum factory, other metal and mineral factories, the Naushk-Ulaanbaatar railway, other transportation systems, and communications systems were developed. 

In addition to establishing the country&#x27;s first major university, Choibalsan initiated policies to increase the literacy rate and developed the 10 year elementary, middle and high school system. The 1949 Communist victory in China eliminated, at least temporarily, the threat on Mongolia&#x27;s southern border, allowing the MPR to begin reducing its 80,000-strong army. Defense expenditures dropped from 33 percent of the total budget in 1948 to 15 percent in 1952.

===Establishing international recognition===
Although Choibalsan maintained a policy of stronger ties with the Soviet Union (in February 1946 he renewed the 1936 Protocol Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance for another ten years and concluded the first bilateral agreement on economic and cultural cooperation), he nonetheless understood the importance of solidifying Mongolia&#x27;s independence through international recognition. In 1948 the MPR established diplomatic relations with the DPRK (North Korea) and then with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 (Mongolia was the first country to recognize the PRC). In 1950 the Eastern Bloc Communist states of East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia all established formal relations with the MPR.

===Strengthening Party rule===
While never reaching the frenzied levels of 1937–1939, arrests and executions of dissidents persisted until Choibalsan&#x27;s death in 1952. Repressions were initiated in 1940, 1941, and 1942. In 1947, a political scandal known as &quot;Port-Arthur&quot; was fabricated around a fictitious plot to assassinate Choibalsan; eighty people were arrested, 42 of whom were executed. The MPRP Central Committee issued proclamations to fight increased anti-revolutionary sentiment and Interior Ministry secret police cells sprouted throughout the country. 

Party allegiance was strengthened by growing membership in the MPRP. Membership doubled from 1940 to 1947, reaching nearly 28,000.

===Falling out with Stalin===

Throughout his remaining years of life, Choibalsan continued to hold out hope of a united Mongolia, especially after the victory of Chinese communists in 1949. When it became clear that Stalin would never back unification, he grew increasingly disillusioned with his former hero. Personal relations between the two leaders deteriorated to the point that by 1949 Choibalsan refused to attend Stalin&#x27;s 70th-birthday celebration in Moscow, sending Tsedenbal in his place. When in 1950 Tsedenbal and other protégés urged Choibalsan to have Mongolia follow the example of Tuva and petition Moscow to be permitted to join the Soviet Union, Choibalsan severely rebuked them.

==Illness, death, and burial==
In late 1951 Choibalsan traveled to Moscow to receive treatment for kidney cancer. According to some sources, this was at the insistence of the Soviets due to the lack of equipment in Mongolia to treat the illness. He was taken by train to the hospital for a week and he died there on 26 January 1952, soon after he had arrived. 

Choibalsan&#x27;s body was returned by a special train to Mongolia with full military honors and was given a state funeral in the capital which was attended by Mongolian and Soviet officials alike. Many days of mourning were declared throughout the country. 

He was originally buried at the Altan-Ölgii National Cemetery in Ulaanbaatar. In July 1954 his body was moved to the newly built Sükhbaatar&#x27;s Mausoleum in front of Government Palace on the north side of Sükhbaatar Square, where the two lay until after the 1990 Democratic Revolution. The Mausoleum was demolished in 2005 and the corpses of both rulers were ritually cremated under the supervision of the Buddhist clergy, and the ashes entombed again at the Altan-Ölgii cemetery.

==Personal life==
Choibalsan married a devout Buddhist seamstress named Borotologai in 1921 and the two remained married until 1935 despite his womanizing. In 1929 he began an affair with the actress Diwa (Dewee), after which Borotologai requested a divorce in 1935. Choibalsan then married a woman named B. Gündegmaa. 

He had no children with either of his wives. In 1937 Choibalsan adopted the son of one of his Interior Ministry subordinates. Later Gündegmaa adopted a girl, Suwd.

== Legacy ==

Choibalsan&#x27;s image in modern Mongolia remains mixed. At the time of his death, he was widely mourned as a hero, a patriot, and ultimately a martyr for the cause of Mongolian independence. Remnants of his strong personality cult, as well as successful efforts by his successor Tsendenbal to obstruct &quot;de-Stalinization&quot; efforts that could have shed light on Choibalsan&#x27;s actions during the purges, helped solidify the positive regard many Mongolians held of their former leader. Official criticisms of Choibalsan in 1956 and 1969, which blamed him for &quot;crude violations of the revolutionary law [that] led to many people perishing,&quot; and even the MPRP Central Committee&#x27;s 1962 decision, in lock-step with Khrushchev&#x27;s anti-Stalinization policies, to take &quot;decisive measures to ensure complete liquidation of the harmful consequences of Kh. Choibalsan&#x27;s cult of personality in all spheres of life,&quot; failed to generate serious public discourse on the matter.

Public anger over the violence of the purges falls predominantly on the Soviet Union and the NKVD, with Choibalsan viewed sympathetically (if not pathetically) as a puppet with little choice but to follow Moscow&#x27;s instructions or else meet the fate of his predecessors Genden and Amar. 

With the end of socialist rule in 1990, however, re-examining of Choibalsan&#x27;s rule has occurred. Nevertheless, Choibalsan is not the object of strong resentment in Mongolia. While Stalin&#x27;s statue, for example, was removed from the front of the National Library in 1990, shortly after the Democratic revolution, Choibalsan&#x27;s statue, still stands in front of the National University in Ulaanbaatar, an institution he helped found and that for a time bore his name. Moreover, the capital of Dornod aimag continues to carry his name.

As for Choibalsan&#x27;s lasting influence, what is clear is that his aggressively pro-Russian stance and his active role in increasing Mongolia&#x27;s economic, political, and social reliance on the Soviet Union turned the country into a Soviet dependency, which has had a lasting impact on modern Mongolian identity and development. 

In 2017, the Mongolian Bank unveiled a Khorloogiin Choibalsan coin.

<doc id="441576" wikidata="Q1801015" url="?curid=441576" title="Glacial Lake Missoula">
<text>Lake Missoula was a prehistoric proglacial lake in western Montana that existed periodically at the end of the last ice age between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago. The lake measured about and contained about of water, half the volume of Lake Michigan.

The &quot;Glacial Lake Missoula National Natural Landmark&quot; is located about 110 kilometers (68 mi) northwest of Missoula, Montana, at the north end of the Camas Prairie Valley, just east of Montana Highway 382 and Macfarlane Ranch. It was designated as a National Natural Landmark in 1966 because it contains the great ripples (often measuring high and long) that served as a strong supporting element for J Harlen Bretz&#x27;s contention that Washington State&#x27;s Channeled Scablands were formed by repeated cataclysmic floods over only about 2,000 years, rather than through the millions of years of erosion that had been previously assumed.

The lake was the result of an ice dam on the Clark Fork caused by the southern encroachment of a finger of the Cordilleran ice sheet into the Idaho Panhandle (at the present-day location of Clark Fork, Idaho, at the east end of Lake Pend Oreille). The height of the ice dam typically approached , flooding the valleys of western Montana approximately eastward. It was the largest ice-dammed lake known to have occurred.

The periodic rupturing of the ice dam resulted in the Missoula Floods – cataclysmic floods that swept across eastern Washington and down the Columbia River Gorge approximately 40 times during a 2,000 year period. The cumulative effect of the floods was to excavate of loess, sediment and basalt from the channeled scablands of eastern Washington and to transport it downstream. These floods are noteworthy for producing canyons and other large geologic features through cataclysms rather than through more typical gradual processes.

In addition, Middle and Early Pleistocene Missoula flood deposits have been documented to comprise parts of the glaciofluvial deposits, informally known as the &quot;Hanford formation&quot; that are found in parts of the Othello Channels, Columbia River Gorge, Channeled Scabland, Quincy Basin, Pasco Basin, and the Walla Walla Valley. The age of these deposits is demonstrated by the presence of multiple interglacial calcretes interbedded in these glaciofluvial deposits, sequences of sediments with normal and reverse magnetostratigraphy, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and unconformity truncated clastic dikes. Based upon these criteria, Quaternary geologists estimated that the oldest of the Pleistocene Missoula floods happened before 1.5 million years ago. The older Pleistocene glaciofluvial deposits within the Hanford formation are fragmentary in nature because they have been repeatedly eroded and largely removed by subsequent Missoula floods. Because of the fragmentary nature of older glaciofluvial deposits, the exact number of older Missoula floods, which are known as &quot;Ancient Cataclysmic Floods&quot;, that occurred during the Pleistocene cannot be estimated with any confidence. Although Lake Missoula likely was the source of many of the Ancient Cataclysmic Floods, the fragmentary nature of the older deposits within the Hanford formation makes precise determination of the precise origin of the floods that deposited them very difficult.

==Geology==
===Ice dam on the Clark Fork River===
The Cordilleran ice sheet originating in British Columbia expanded out of the mountains and southward. A tongue of ice pushed down the Purcell Valley or Purcell Trench, reaching south beyond Lake Pend Oreille. This Purcell Lobe blocked the natural outlet of the Clark Fork River. Including its tributaries, Clark Fork represented western Montana&#x27;s most important river system. The ice mass that effectively dammed Clark Fork was about deep and extended for at least 10 miles; some say it extended as much as 30 miles. The ice dam reached east up the Clark&#x27;s Fork to Cabinet, Montana, and southward around the mountain to Bayview, Idaho on the south tip of Lake Pend Oreille in Farragut State Park. Here, the ice sheet stood over and south of Lake Missoula.

===Lake levels===
The Clark Fork&#x27;s drainage is a network of valleys among high mountain ranges. Lake Missoula formed through this region of western Montana. It is named for the city of Missoula in the upper reaches of the Clark Fork watershed. The mountains surrounding the city show the strandlines from the lake nearly 20,000 years ago. At its largest extent, Lake Missoula&#x27;s depth exceeded and may have held of water, as much as Lake Erie and Lake Ontario combined. The surface area covered and the shoreline attained an elevation of .

The lake spread through the Clark Fork River basin, reaching east of Missoula, to Gold Creek; northeast up the Blackfoot River to Lake Alva; and east of Ovando . Two large lobes formed to the south and north. To the south the Bitterroot Valley filled as far as Sula, Montana, . To the north the Flathead River basin became an expansive body of water, creating an island of Red Sleep Mountain (in the CSKT Bison Range) and extending north to Polson at the basin of the Flathead Ice Lobe and up the Little Bitterroot River to Niarada some above the Flathead Rivers mouth at the Clarks Fork.

The water was deep (average – ): maximum – ), dark and murky with sediment. Fish fossils have not been found in deposits of Lake Missoula. Possibly, glacial sediment, rock flour, suspended in the turbid lake water which created an hostile aquatic habitat for fish. In addition, fossils of large mammals (megafauna), i.e.; mammoths, mastodons and bison which may have roamed nearby, not been found. Similarly, neither the remains or artifacts of contemporaneous humans have been found associated with Lake Missoula. The Clark Fork River flows into Lake Pend Oreille at .

This reach follows Montana Route 200 up the Clark Fork River canyon, to Paradise, then follows the Clark Fork, then through the Paradise-St. Regis Canyon along Montana Highway 135. At St. Regis, the canyon opens out and continues to the east with the river paralleled by Interstate 90 to as far as Ninemile, where it opens out into the Missoula basin. A western branch of this basin runs up the St. Regis River another along with Interstate 90 to near Riverbend. 
*Lookout Pass, asl along Interstate 90
*Thompson Falls – Located in the northern or western reach of the basin, the modern river passes through a layer of harder rock, forming a cascade.
*: Nine Mile Rhythmites – Located at the eastern end of the basin, near Nine Mile. A light pink sand and silt deposited on the bottom of the lake. The silt deposits exist where the basin was wide, and when the lake drained, the area was not reached by the fast current of the water moving downstream. Each lay represents a period of still water behind the ice dam. The series reflects each period of still water with the intervening draining of the lake. As with &quot;varves&quot;, darker layers are winter deposits, comprising fine particles in quiet water, and the lighter layers are coarser particles from the more active summer currents. Here, the number of layers represent 1,000 years of sediment.

===Flathead Basin===
The Flathead basin abutted the south face of the ice sheet. For most of this period, the glacial ice reached south to Polson, covering the entirety of Flathead Lake. The basin drains from the Polson Moraine at the south end of Flathead Lake, south to Ravalli, with a major lobe up the Little Bitterroot River and a minor basin on Camas Creek near Perma. 
* Little Money Creek Gulch Fill – Exit 96, north on US 93 to Ravalli. The coarse materials filled the side gulches on the narrow valley as Lake Missoula drained; eddy currents in tributary gulches deposited debris.
* Rainbow &quot;Dog&quot; Lake – Drains into the Clark Fork near Plains. During the existence of Lake Missoula, it was a drain for the Little Bitterroot basin when the lake level exceeded asl and for the Camas Prairie basin when the lake level exceeded asl. At the maximum depth of Lake Missoula, the valley was a waterway. Rainbow Lake is thought to be a cataract retreat lake, formed by a waterfall. The Clark Fork River dropped near Plains, creating a current through Boyer Creek. A weaker layer of rock beneath a more resistant layer was removed, causing the lip of the falls to retreat backward. Evidence is provided by the debris that lines the valley bottom.
* Camas Prairie Mega ripples – Camas Prairie is a small basin on Camas Creek, north of Perma. At the maximum water levels of the Hwy 382 through the prairie to information sign at mile marker13. Multiple long ridges of sediment, height and apart. Average height between . Formed during the outflow of water during a break in the ice dam. The Camas Prairie Basin filled when Lake Missoula reached asl. As the water in the Lake Missoula Basin rose, this basin gained a second outlet through Rainbow Lake at asl; Willis Gulch asl; Markle Pass asl; and Big Gulch asl.
* Markle Pass Kolks – Montana Highway 382 travels through Markle Pass between Camas Prairie and the Little Bitterroot Valley. The Kolks were carved out of the bedrock by strong underwater vortices created as Lake Missoula quickly drained during the great floods. When the tornado-like currents reached the bottom of the waterway, rocks were pulled out of the bottom surface. This debris can be found downstream towards Camas Prairie and Burgess Lake.

===Missoula Basin===
The basin extends from Missoula, west to Ninemile and up the Ninemile Creek valley. This valley broadens from at Ninemile to at Missoula. The central part of this basin around Missoula is wide east–west and north-south. The basin is bordered by Rattlesnake Ridge on the north and Petty Mountain on the south(west). Features: strandlines along the valleys east flank. 
* Glacial erratic on the grounds of the University of Montana
* Strandlines can be seen on the slopes of both Mount Jumbo ( asl) and Mount Sentinel ( asl), east in the Missoula Valley. These lines represent lake levels as the ice dam in the Purcell Trench failed and a lower lake level formed.
* Nine Mile Rhythmites on the bottom of the lake are visible.

===Hamilton Basin===
The basin extends from south of Conner to Lolo, to the north. The Bitterroot Mountains form the west shore and the Sapphire Mountains the east.

===Blackfoot River Basin===
The valleys of Potomac, Greenough, and Ovando-Helmville are linked by the Blackfoot River east of Missoula. A second reach, up the Clearwater River, joins the Blackfoot River at Clearwater. This basin joins the Clark Fork at Bonner. Upper valleys of the Clearwater-Blackfoot River basins run from Seeley Lake, eastward to Browns Lake along Montana Route 83 and Montana Route 200.

===Upper Clark Fork===
The Clark Fork of the Columbia River has its headwater near Butte, east of Missoula. Lake Missoula reached up the valley, about to the east along I-90 to just east of Gold Creek. Smaller reaches formed along the tributary valleys of Gold Creek, up Flint Creek, forming an basin, up Lower Willow Creek, and up Rock Creek.

<doc id="441578" wikidata="Q182971" url="?curid=441578" title="Booted eagle">
<text>The booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus, also classified as Aquila pennata) is a medium-sized mostly migratory bird of prey with a wide distribution in the Palearctic and southern Asia, wintering in the tropics of Africa and Asia, with a small, disjunct breeding population in south-western Africa. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family &quot;Accipitridae&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The booted eagle was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the eagle, falcons and relatives in the genus &quot;Falco&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Falco pennatus&quot;. Gmelin based his description on &quot;&quot;Le Faucon Patu&quot; &quot; or &quot;&quot;Falco pedibus pennatis&quot; &quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. Brisson had examined a specimen in the collection of Madame de Bandeville who was also known as Marie Anne Catherine Bigot de Graveron (1709-1787). The booted eagle is now placed in the genus &quot;Hieraaetus&quot; that was introduced in 1844 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;hierax&quot; meaning &quot;hawk&quot; with &quot;aetos&quot; meaning &quot;eagle&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;pennatus&quot; is Latin and means &quot;feathered&quot;. The booted eagle has no recognised subspecies.

Based on recent genetic research some authors reclassified this species to the genus &quot;Aquila&quot;, along with some or all other &quot;Hieraaetus&quot; species. As it is the type species of &quot;Hieraaetus&quot;, should any of the hawk-eagles have been retained in a distinct genus then a new name for that group would have been necessary. However, DNA research has shown it forms a monophyletic clade with Ayres&#x27;s hawk eagle, Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle, little eagle and the pygmy eagle and this clade is often treated as forming the genus &quot;Hieraeetus&quot; and most reference lists currently use &quot;H. pennata&quot;.

Although some authors name a number of subspecies most now treat it as a monotypic species.

&quot;Aquila minut&quot; described by Brehm (1831) is this bird. The fossil bird described under the same name by Milne-Edwards (1871) is preliminarily known as &quot;Hieraaetus edwardsi&quot;, but might belong in &quot;Aquila&quot;.

==Description==
The booted eagle is a small eagle, comparable to the common buzzard in size though more eagle-like in shape. Males grow to about in weight, with females about with a length of 40 cm and a wingspan of 110–132 cm. There are two relatively distinct plumage forms. Pale birds are mainly light grey with a darker head and flight feathers. The other form has mid-brown plumage with dark grey flight feathers. It was found in a study investigating polymorphism that these discrete colour morphs follow a Mendelian inheritance pattern, where the paler allele is dominant. In South Africa, 20% of the population is the dark colour morph. Booted eagles are typically seen in pairs or as solitary individuals. However, the study found that the darker morphs are much more common in the eastern populations such as in Russia.
The call is a shrill &quot;kli-kli-kli&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The booted eagle has breeding populations in many different regions in both the northern and southern hemisphere. These include southern Europe, North Africa and across Asia, and also in western South Africa and Namibia.
The northern populations are migratory spending November to February in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, while the small southern African populations is sedentary. This is a species of wooded, often hilly countryside with some open areas. It breeds in rocky, broken terrain but migrants will use almost any type of habitat other than dense forest. The birds of the Palearctic breeding population tend to nest in coniferous or deciduous woodlands and often in trees.

=== Southern African populations ===
It is believed that there may be three separate groups of booted eagles in Southern Africa. There is evidence of a population which breeds in the south-western Cape region of South Africa, arriving in early August, laying eggs in September, and leaving in March of the following year. From about April to July the birds migrate northwards, some possibly overwintering in Namibia. A small breeding population in Northern Namibia has also been observed. The third group is a non-breeding population thought to migrate south from Eurasia and North Africa in summer, however no empirical evidence of this has been documented. These booted eagle populations are not sub-specifically distinct from those in Palearctic regions.

In South Africa, booted eagles also occur in hilly and open landscapes and in contrast to their Northern Hemisphere conspecifics, typically breed strictly on rocky cliffs in ravines and gorges. However, evidence has been found in South Africa of birds nesting in trees such as Euphorbias. This bird is most common in the low stature shrublands of the Fynbos and Karoo, and more specifically the ecotone between the two biomes.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
The booted eagle typically flies at relatively low heights, making it conspicuous. However, the dark morph can be confused with other local medium sized birds of prey. In South Africa, 20% of the population is the dark colour morph.

=== Diet and hunting ===
The booted eagle typically hunts on the wing, stooping quickly with wings folded in and feet extended. It hunts small mammals, reptiles and birds. In Southern Africa, it has been noted that birds are the most common prey. It has been suggested that frogs comprise an important part of the booted eagle diet, however this has not been observed in the Southern African populations. Studies conducted in south-western South Africa observed that they ate birds, lizards, and rodents.

===Breeding===
This eagle lays 1–2 eggs in a nest built from sticks and lined with green leaves in a tree or on a crag, or it takes over the disused nest of another large bird such as a black kite or grey heron. The female incubates the egg for around 45 days and is fed by the male, after hatching she guards the nest and the young while the male provides all the food. The chick fledges after 70–75 days. Booted eagles are monogamous and perform courtship rituals of sophisticated flight demonstrations.

==== Southern Africa ====
The population of eagles which breed in the Cape region of South Africa typically do so shortly after arriving in August. The breeding pairs nest on cliff ledges, this is one of the ways in which this population differs to the Palearctic booted eagles. It has been observed that the incubation period for this population is about 40 days, and the nestling period around two months. It was found in a study conducted in South Africa that typical to the species, booted eagles nested on cliffs at an average height of 60m. The clutch size was also comparable with Palearctic populations, with pairs generally successfully raising two chicks according to existing evidence. The eggs are typically a conspicuous white colour sometimes with red speckles. The dimensions of the eggs are consistent with those of Palearctic populations. The nests of the booted eagles in Southern Africa also appear to be less rigid than those of their Palearctic counterparts.

==== Northern African ====
Populations of booted eagles migrate to parts of North Africa during European winter and breed there. A study conducted in Algeria determined that these birds typically incubate their eggs for a period of 33 to 38 days. Similarly to populations further North and South, it was most likely for clutches to consist of two eggs (67.6%).

== Conservation and threats ==
There is a great lack of research about this migratory species. The Southern African populations were relatively recently discovered in the 1980s, possibly suggesting that they migrated due to changing climate and environmental conditions. Changes in human land use may have driven the changes in migration patterns of these birds. It is also thought that this species has been overlooked in Southern Africa due to the remote and discrete nature of their nesting sites. This emphasizes the need for further research to fully understand the ecology and conservation status of this species.

<doc id="441584" wikidata="Q616477" url="?curid=441584" title="Mint julep">
<text>Mint julep is an alcoholic cocktail, consisting primarily of bourbon, sugar, water, crushed or shaved ice, and fresh mint. As a bourbon-based cocktail, it is associated with the American South and the cuisine of the Southern United States in general, in particular as a symbol of the Kentucky Derby.

==Preparation==
A mint julep is traditionally made with four ingredients: mint leaf, bourbon, simple syrup, and crushed ice. Traditionally, spearmint is the mint of choice used in Southern states, and in Kentucky in particular. Proper preparation of the cocktail is commonly debated, as methods may vary considerably from one bartender to another. The mint julep may be considered a member of a loosely associated family of drinks called &quot;smashes&quot; (the brandy smash is another example, as well as the mojito), in which fresh mint and other ingredients are muddled or crushed in preparation for flavoring the finished drink. The step further releases essential oils and juices into the mixture, intensifying the flavor from the added ingredient or ingredients.

Traditionally, mint juleps are served in silver or pewter cups, and held only by the bottom and top edges of the cup. This allows frost to form on the outside of the cup. Traditional hand placement may have arisen as a way to reduce the heat transferred from the hand to the silver or pewter cup. Today, mint juleps are most commonly served in a tall old-fashioned glass, Collins glass, or highball glass with a straw.

==History==

The term &quot;julep&quot; is generally defined as a sweet drink, particularly one used as a vehicle for medicine. The word itself is derived from the Spanish &quot;julepe&quot;, from Spanish Arabic, and this from the Persian word گلاب (&quot;Golâb&quot;), meaning rosewater. English juleps, as opposed to later American mint juleps, were primarily medicinal, lightly alcoholic, and often contained camphor.

The mint julep originated in the southern United States, probably during the eighteenth century. The earliest known mentions come from 1770 and include a satirical play by Robert Munford, &quot;The Candidate&quot; (where a drunkard character “Mr. Julip” appears); and &quot;A Short Poem on Hunting&quot; (which describes julep as a concoction &quot;Which doctors storm at, and which some adore&quot;), published in the Williamsburg &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot;. Further evidence of mint julep as a prescription drink can be found in 1784 &quot;Medical communications:&quot; &quot;sickness at the stomach, with frequent retching, and, at times, difficulty of swallowing. I then prescribed her an emetic, some opening powders, and a mint julep.&quot;

In 1793 Rev. Harry Toulmin described mint julep as “a tumbler of rum and water, well sweetened, with a slip of mint in it.”. An appearance of a mint julep in print came in a book by John Davis published in London in 1803, in which it was described as &quot;a dram of spirituous liquor that has mint steeped in it, taken by Virginians of a morning.&quot; Davis&#x27; interviewee mentions his love for whiskey came from his daily preparation of the drink.

Virginia taverns such as J. Pryor&#x27;s Haymarket Inn in Richmond began including ice-houses (possibly for the iced cocktails too) in their infrastructure in the 1780s, and the first mention of &quot;Iced Julep&quot; appears on May 4, 1807, in an advertisement for the Wig-Wam Gardens in Norfolk.

U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky introduced the drink to Washington, D.C., at the Round Robin Bar in the famous Willard Hotel during his residence in the city.

Americans enjoyed not only bourbon-based juleps during the nineteenth century, but also gin-based juleps made with genever, an aged gin.

By 1820, the julep was a legacy in Virginia and had been adopted as an item of local identity. The first acknowledged master of mint juleps was Jasper Crouch from Richmond, who identified himself as a Free Person of Color.

In the 1830s in New York was known a version known as &quot;hailstone&quot; julep or &quot;hailstorm&quot; julep, which included small &quot;hailstones&quot; or pounded small lumps of ice.

British captain Frederick Marryat&#x27;s 1840 book &quot;Second Series of A Diary in America&quot; describes on page 41 the &quot;real mint julep&quot; thus:

The 1862 edition of &quot;Bar-Tenders Guide: How to Mix Drinks or The Bon-Vivant&#x27;s Companion&quot; by Jerry Thomas includes five recipes for the mint julep (as well as an illustration of how it is to be served) allowing for either Cognac, brandy, gin, whiskey or sparkling Moselle. Thomas states of the mint julep, &quot;... a peculiarly American beverage ... It was introduced [later] into England by Captain Maryatt.&quot;
In 1916, the traditional Virginia recipe as served at the &quot;Old White&quot; is described

Beginning in the 20th century, bourbon-based juleps decisively eclipsed gin-based juleps.

==Kentucky Derby==
The mint julep has been promoted by Churchill Downs in association with the Kentucky Derby since 1938. As of 2009, about 120,000 juleps were served at Churchill Downs over the two-day period of the Kentucky Oaks and the Kentucky Derby, virtually all of them in specially made Kentucky Derby collectible glasses.

In a contract arrangement between the Brown-Forman Corporation and Churchill Downs that has lasted more than 18 years, the Early Times Mint Julep Cocktail has been the designated &quot;official mint julep of the Kentucky Derby&quot;, although the Early Times sold within the United States is a Kentucky whiskey, not a bourbon, due to its being aged in used, rather than new, oak barrels. However beginning in 2015, Old Forester, which is also produced by the Brown-Forman Corporation, is now &quot;the official drink of the Kentucky Derby,&quot; when sold as Old Forester Mint Julep Ready-to-Serve Cocktail.

Since 2006, Churchill Downs has also served extra-premium custom-made mint juleps at a cost of $1000 each at the Kentucky Derby. These mint juleps were served in gold-plated cups with silver straws, and were made from Woodford Reserve bourbon, mint imported from Ireland, spring water ice cubes from the Bavarian Alps, and sugar from Australia. The proceeds were used to support charitable causes dedicated to retired race horses. Woodford Reserve, Early Times, and Old Forester are sister brands produced by Brown-Forman, and under the terms of its current marketing agreement with Churchill Downs, Woodford Reserve is called the &quot;official &quot;bourbon&quot;&quot; of the derby.

In May 2008, Churchill Downs unveiled the world&#x27;s largest mint julep glass. Churchill Downs, in conjunction with Brown-Forman, commissioned the Weber Group to fabricate the tall glass ( if the mint sprig is included). The glass was constructed from FDA food-grade acrylic, heated and molded into the shape of an official 2008 Derby glass. It had a capacity of , and distributed the Early Times mint juleps at the Derby with an elaborate pumping system concealed within the &quot;stir straw&quot;.

<doc id="441588" wikidata="Q1660555" url="?curid=441588" title="Maleficent">
<text>Maleficent ( or ) is a fictional character who first appears in Walt Disney Productions&#x27; animated film, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959). Maleficent is the self-proclaimed &quot;Mistress of All Evil&quot; based on the evil fairy godmother character in Charles Perrault&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, as well as the villainess who appears in the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s retelling of the story, &quot;Little Briar Rose&quot;. Maleficent was originally animated by Marc Davis.

In the 1959 film, Maleficent was originally voiced by Eleanor Audley, who earlier voiced Lady Tremaine, Cinderella&#x27;s evil stepmother, in &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950). Maleficent is represented as an evil fairy and the self-proclaimed &quot;Mistress of All Evil&quot; who, after not being invited to a christening, curses the infant Princess Aurora to &quot;prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die&quot; before the sun sets on Aurora&#x27;s sixteenth birthday.

A revision of the character appeared as the protagonist in the 2014 live-action film &quot;Maleficent&quot;, portrayed by Angelina Jolie, who reprised the role in the 2019 sequel &quot;&quot;. This version of Maleficent is portrayed as a sympathetic character, who is misunderstood in trying to protect herself and her domain from humans.

==Development==
The character was animated by Marc Davis, who also animated Aurora in the film. She was aptly named &quot;Maleficent&quot; (an adjective derived from the Latin &quot;maleficentia&quot;, which means &quot;doing evil or harm&quot;), and may have been based on earlier French and European myths and legends about the fairy Mélusine, especially in the 2014 live-action film of the same name. French historian Jean Markale suggested that the name &quot;Mélusine&quot; may have derived from the earlier Latin name &quot;Mala Lucina&quot;, with &quot;Lucina&quot; being an epithet of Juno, the Roman goddess of marriage and childbirth. In determining Maleficent&#x27;s design, standard depictions of witches and hags were dismissed, as Davis had opted for an elegant, sinister, green-skinned beauty, depicted as &quot;vain femme fatale, utilizing a classic archetype of a bad woman&quot;. According to Davis, Maleficent &quot;was designed like a giant vampire bat to create a feeling of menace&quot;.

She was voiced by Eleanor Audley, who had previously performed Lady Tremaine, Cinderella&#x27;s evil stepmother, in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950). Audley also provided some live-action recording for both of these characters to inspire the animators. In addition, dancer Jane Fowler performed some live-action reference for Maleficent. Animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas, in their book &quot;The Disney Villain&quot;, describe animating Audley&#x27;s voice as &quot;a difficult assignment but a thrilling one, working to that voice track with so much innuendo, mixed in with the fierce power&quot;.

It was long rumored that Maleficent&#x27;s likeness was inspired by actress Maila Nurmi, best known for her character Vampira, a camp icon that was created in 1953, and inspired by Morticia Addams from &quot;The Addams Family&quot; comic strip by Charles Addams for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;; the Dragon Lady from the comic strip &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;; and the Evil Queen from Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937). In 2014, entries were discovered in Nurmi&#x27;s journals describing sessions for Walt Disney in November 1956, and the Walt Disney Company was subsequently able to find archival documents corroborating Nurmi&#x27;s participation as a &quot;live-action reference&quot; model for the character. Maleficent&#x27;s likeness in the eponymous 2014 film, as portrayed by actress Angelina Jolie, was inspired by Lady Gaga&#x27;s appearance in her &quot;Born This Way&quot; (2011) music video.

For the scene when Maleficent transforms into a dragon in the original film, she was animated by Eric Cleworth, who said that the dragon was modeled on a rattlesnake, with &quot;powerful muscles moving a bulky body over the rocky terrain&quot;. Sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald searched for the sound of a dragon&#x27;s fiery breath by requesting the United States Army to send him some training films on flame throwing, and these films provided just the right sound for him.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;===

In the animated film, where she is voiced by Eleanor Audley, Maleficent arrives at King Stefan and Queen Leah&#x27;s castle during the christening of their newborn daughter, Princess Aurora. She expresses displeasure about not receiving an invitation, to which one of the good fairies named Merryweather replies that she was unwanted. Angered, she prepares to leave. Queen Leah asks her if she is offended, causing Maleficent to deny her rage, and subsequently offers to bestow a &quot;gift&quot; on Aurora to prove that she &quot;bears no ill will&quot;. Maleficent confirms that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, &quot;beloved by all who know her&quot;, but as revenge for not being invited by the kingdom, she curses Aurora so that before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel&#x27;s spindle and die. Before the Royal Guards can seize her, Maleficent disappears, laughing triumphantly. Though Merryweather still has her gift to bestow, she cannot dispel Maleficent&#x27;s power, but she can weaken the curse: if Aurora was to prick her finger, she will not die but only sleep until a kiss from her true love awakens her.

Later, at her castle in the Forbidden Mountains, a frustrated Maleficent asks her bestial army why they have been unable to find Aurora, who had been hidden and brought up by the three good fairies. Maleficent learns that they have focused on searching for a baby the entire time, even though 16 years have passed. She flies into a destructive rage, and soon desperately instructs her pet raven, Diablo, to find Aurora. The bird manages to succeed due to a magical quarrel between Merryweather and Flora, which exposes their location.

On the evening of Aurora&#x27;s sixteenth birthday, after the three fairies have momentarily left the depressed princess alone in a castle room, Maleficent visits Aurora in the form of a will-o-the-wisp, luring the princess to a tower room where Maleficent transforms into a spinning wheel. The fairies, realizing their mistake, pursue Aurora to the tower room. Unfortunately, on Maleficent&#x27;s command, Aurora pricks her finger on the spindle and falls asleep. When Flora, Merryweather, and Fauna arrive too late, Maleficent appears and taunts them of their attempts of defeating her. Maleficent then reveals Aurora, shocking the fairies as she disappears, cackling, leaving the fairies heartbroken at what happened.

Later on, Maleficent and her goons capture Prince Phillip, Aurora&#x27;s true love, and imprisons him. Maleficent then rests well, thinking she has triumphed. However, she later wakes up and by seeing that Diablo has been turned to stone, she discovers that the fairies have freed Phillip from her dungeon. She climbs to the top of one of her castle&#x27;s towers and proceeds to blast Phillip with lightning, and after the good fairies foil these attempts, she summons a forest of thorns, through which Phillip slices his way out. Enraged, she blows away and confronts him in front of King Stefan&#x27;s castle and transforms herself into a huge dark dragon. The three fairies cast an enhancing enchantment on Phillip&#x27;s Sword of Truth, which he throws into Maleficent&#x27;s heart, mortally wounding her before she falls off the crumbling cliff to her death. 

===&quot;Maleficent&quot; film series===
====&quot;Maleficent&quot;====
The 2014 live-action reboot presents Maleficent as a good-hearted but tragic fairy who defends the Moors, a realm of supernatural beings, from neighboring humans. She is played by Angelina Jolie.

Prior to sporting her iconic dark attire, Maleficent had a pair of giant wings and wore a brown leather dress, with sandals and an anklet. She could heal a tree&#x27;s broken branch just by touching it, and shared an immense fondness with all the denizens of her mystical domain. Maleficent befriends a thieving peasant boy named Stefan, upon being alerted to his presence by a trio of pixies: Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton), Thistletwit (Juno Temple), and Flittle (Lesley Manville).

As a young adult, Maleficent is betrayed by her love interest, Stefan, who uses iron to burn off her wings so that he can succeed King Henry (Henry declared a bounty on Maleficent&#x27;s life, after she gravely felled him while thwarting his armed invasion of the Moors). After claiming a raven named Diaval (Sam Riley) as her henchman, Maleficent renames herself from guardian of the Moors to ruler of same. Both her clothing and her realm turn dark, reflecting the hatred with which she is now consumed. When she learns that now-King Stefan and his Queen Leila have a newborn daughter named Aurora (Elle Fanning), Maleficent acts in the name of what she considers poetic justice by cursing the newborn Aurora to fall into a deathlike slumber on her 16th birthday; the spell can be broken only by the kiss of true love, which neither Maleficent nor Stefan believe in. Knotgrass, Thistletwit, and Flittle are assigned to look after Aurora until after her 16th birthday; the pixies prove to be grossly incompetent and negligent, however. In order to ensure that her curse comes to pass, Maleficent cares for and (when required) protects the child from afar. Eventually, as Aurora grows into an industrious and sweet-tempered young woman, Maleficent recognizes the folly of punishing Stefan&#x27;s daughter for something he alone did. This tender regard for Aurora enables Maleficent to undo the damage which she herself inflicted; after Philip&#x27;s kiss fails to break the curse (because he&#x27;s not yet truly in love with Aurora), Maleficent voices her regrets and herself kisses Aurora&#x27;s brow. Roused from her enchanted sleep, and now fully aware of her father&#x27;s true nature, Aurora foils his efforts to destroy Maleficent by returning the dark fairy&#x27;s severed wings. Completely stripped of her bitterness and thirst for vengeance, Maleficent declares an end to her feud with Stefan, but the king, driven by shame too great to bear, attempts to kill her &quot;and&quot; himself, only to take a fatal fall from his own castle&#x27;s highest turret.

Following Aurora&#x27;s ascension over her late parents&#x27; domain, Maleficent crowns her to rule the Moors as well, with Diaval and Phillip looking on proudly.

====&quot;Maleficent: Mistress of Evil&quot;====

Angelina Jolie reprised the role in &quot;Maleficent: Mistress of Evil&quot;, in which Maleficent&#x27;s relationship with Aurora was tested. Other fairies of her species appeared, led by Conall (Chiwetel Ejiofor). In the course of the film, Prince Philip&#x27;s mother Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) attempts to provoke a war between the humans and the fairies by creating the impression that Maleficent has cast another curse on the king, forcing Maleficent to flee the kingdom only to be rescued by others of her kind. During this time, Maleficent&#x27;s species is identified as &#x27;Dark Fey&#x27;, although Maleficent&#x27;s powers are unique to her due to her being the latest reincarnation of the powerful Phoenix. The queen nearly destroys the fairies after devising a cloud of red dust that will turn all fairies exposed to it into plants and luring them into a church for Aurora&#x27;s wedding, but during the Dark Fey&#x27;s attack on the kingdom, Aurora learns the truth and is able to convince both sides to stand down, Philip appealing to his own soldiers while Aurora confronts Maleficent. After asserting that she still regards Maleficent as her mother, Aurora is knocked off a tower by the queen, but Maleficent is able to save Aurora, ending the conflict when she breaks the curse on the King and turns the Queen into a goat. With peace restored, Maleficent walks Aurora down the aisle for her wedding to Philip, and later assures Aurora that she will return when their first child is born.

===&quot;Descendants&quot; franchise===
Kristin Chenoweth played Maleficent in Disney Channel live-action film &quot;Descendants&quot; (2015), which follows the teenage children of Disney&#x27;s iconic heroes and villains, including Maleficent&#x27;s daughter Mal. She is the main antagonist of the film, as well as the leader of the villains who have been imprisoned on the Isle of the Lost. In the prequel novel for the film, &quot;The Isle of the Lost&quot;, it is mentioned that she and the Evil Queen argued over being the ruler of the place. In the film, she longs to get the Fairy Godmother&#x27;s magic wand, and combine it with her scepter in order to rule good and evil as she pleases, for which she entrusts her daughter with the task of stealing it. When she accidentally breaches the barrier surrounding the island, she and Maleficent escape from her and obtain the wand, freezing the inhabitants of Auradon on the spot. Mal confronts her mother with the help of her friends to recover the wand, with Maleficent having to transform into a dragon in the confrontation. However, the power that Mal possesses of her thanks to the friendship of her friends, helps her defeat her mother, transforming her into a lizard, and immediately afterwards being locked in a glass cabinet.

In the sequel &quot;Descendants 2&quot; (2017), Maleficent continues in her lizard form, and is taken back by Mal to the Isle of the Lost, where she accidentally falls and ends up on the streets of the place. Although she does not appear in &quot;Descendants 3&quot; (2019), it is revealed that Mal&#x27;s father is Hades.

She appears in the animated television special &quot;&quot; (2021), still turned into a lizard, where she attends Mal and Ben&#x27;s wedding.

A teenage Maleficent appears in the spin-off film &quot;&quot;, played by actress Marissa Kruep.

In dragon form, she mothered Lilith (Nicole Muñoz [teen]/Agnes Bruckner [adult]), and ends up making a deal with the protagonists to find her. In the series finale, it is mentioned in dialogue that Lilith&#x27;s father was Zorro, whom no one knew could become a dragon.

In the spin-off series &quot;Once Upon a Time in Wonderland&quot;, Robin Hood and his Merry Men infiltrate Maleficent&#x27;s castle in the episode &quot;Forget Me Not&quot;, although she does not make an appearance, only hearing her dragon roar when she discovers that there are intruders.

==Reception==

The original version of Maleficent has been called as &quot;one of the most sinister Disney Villains&quot;. She is generally described as an &quot;evil, cold hearted fairy who can curse an innocent baby just because she is not invited to the christening ceremony.&quot; Guillermo del Toro has stated that along with Vermithrax in &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, Maleficent is his favorite cinematic dragon. Voice actress Eleanor Audley and supervising animator Marc Davis were also praised for their work on the character. In 2016, The Frisky described Maleficent and the Evil Queen as &quot;two of the best-realized female villains in movie history.&quot;

Maleficent&#x27;s live-action version from the film series of the same name has received critical attention, different from its original, animated counterpart. Benjamin Justice describes this version of Maleficent as &quot;a full person, good and evil, powerful and vulnerable, vengeful and loving&quot; and notes that, while she and Aurora value heterosexual relationships and love, neither of them &quot;let the idea of [one true love] define the arc of the personal or public lives.&quot; When analyzing Maleficent&#x27;s disability after she loses her wings due to Stephan&#x27;s betrayal, Colleen Elaine Donnelly compares her role to that of Elphaba in &quot;Wicked&quot;, explaining that in both cases, the story &quot;intends to reform the stereotype of the evil witch by providing a backstory.&quot;

<text>The Buteoninae are a subfamily of birds of prey which consists of medium to large, broad-winged species.

They have large, powerful, hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, and powerful talons. They also have extremely keen eyesight to enable them to spot potential prey from a distance.

This subfamily contains the buzzards (buteonine hawks) with great diversity in appearance and form and some appearing eagle-like, with at least 50 species included overall in the subfamily. At one time, several types were grouped, including large assemblages such as booted eagles, but modern studies using mitochondrial DNA clarified that this subfamily was smaller than formerly classified.

==Systematics==
The subfamily Buteoninae was introduced (as &quot;Buteonina&quot;) by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Vigors in 1825 with &quot;Buteo&quot; as the type genus. The subfamily includes about 79 currently recognized species. Unlike the many lineages of Accipitridae which seem to have radiated out of Africa or South Asia, the Buteoninae clearly originated in the Americas based on fossil records and current species distributions (more than 75% of the extant raptors from this lineage are found in the Americas).

A genus level cladogram of the Buteoninae is shown below. It is based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the family Accipitridae by Therese Catanach and collaborators that was published in 2024.

<text>The Beverly Hills Supper Club fire in Southgate, Kentucky, is the seventh deadliest nightclub fire in history. It occurred on the night of May 28, 1977, during the Memorial Day holiday weekend. A total of 165 people died and more than 200 were injured as a result of the blaze.

==Club==
The Beverly Hills Supper Club was a major attraction, less than 2.5 miles (4 km) outside Cincinnati, just across the Ohio River in Southgate, Kentucky, on US 27, near what would later become its interchange with Interstate 471. The club booked its entertainers from Las Vegas, Nashville, Hollywood, New York, and other show-business hubs. The site had been a popular nightspot and illegal gambling house as early as 1926. Ohio native Dean Martin had been a blackjack dealer there. 

In 1967, organized crime figures Moe Dalitz, Morris Kleinman and Samuel A. Tucker sold The Beverly Hills Country Club to Joseph E. Cole, Sam W. Klein, Carl Glickman and two other men (one of whom has been linked to New Jersey mob boss Gerardo Catena),&lt;ref name=&quot;UPI/cP-jeCole-MOB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who, in 1974, sold to the Richard Schilling family.

In 1971, the club had reopened under the then-current owners and management and was considered an elegant venue that attracted top-notch talent and affluent clientele.
Several additions had been built onto the original structure between 1970 and 1976, creating a sprawling, non-linear complex of function rooms and service areas. The resulting complex was roughly square in shape, and though it was not situated in a north–south direction, reports of the fire have tended to use these as reference points when describing the complex. Assuming this system, the front entrance of the complex lay at the southern point of the compass. Along the central portion of the southern wall, to the east of the building entrance, was a small event room called the Zebra Room. A narrow corridor to the Zebra Room&#x27;s east separated it from the Viennese Room and a series of service spaces, which ran northward along the building&#x27;s eastern wall. This interior corridor terminated between the Garden Room, occupying the central portion of the north wall of the building, and the Cabaret Room, which jutted out from the northeastern corner of the building.

A smaller, branching corridor led from the internal corridor to an exit door that sat between the Garden Room and the Cabaret Room; to exit the building from the Cabaret Room using that corridor, a person would need to pass through a set of double doors into the main interior corridor, pass through a single door between the main interior corridor and the branching interior corridor, turn a sharp corner into the branching corridor, and proceed approximately one-quarter of the length of the Cabaret Room to the single door that connected the branching corridor to the exterior of the building. This complex navigation was not atypical for the building; a number of other event and services spaces were scattered throughout the rest of the building, with some rooms leading into each other, some leading into interior hallways, and some leading to the outside of the building. A partial second story covered approximately the southern third of the building, sitting above the main entrance, Zebra Room, and main dining room; it held two more small event rooms made of six smaller rooms conjoined, collectively labeled the Crystal Rooms.

Though the building&#x27;s frame and ceiling tiling was classified as non-combustible, the Beverly Hills Supper Club made substantial use of wooden building materials, including floor joists for the two-story portion of the complex and framing on interior hallways. It was decorated throughout with highly flammable carpeting and wood wall paneling; event rooms also used wooden tables and supports, as well as tablecloths, curtains, and a variety of other small combustible materials. The building did not have a fire-suppression sprinkler system installed—at the time, these were not required in venues such as the Supper Club—nor did it have an alarm system or smoke detectors. In addition, the majority of the paths of egress in each event room led not to the outside of the building, but to a variety of narrow interior corridors and service spaces.

==Fire==
On Saturday, May 28, 1977, the Beverly Hills Supper Club was operating beyond capacity, largely due to the popularity of that evening&#x27;s Cabaret Room show, featuring popular Hollywood singer and actor John Davidson. Based on its number of exits, the Cabaret Room could safely accommodate about 600 people, according to the calculations of the Fire Marshal. On that night it exceeded capacity, with people seated on ramps and in aisles. According to later estimates based on seating charts and memories of those present, the number of patrons in the Cabaret Room at 9:00 p.m. on was between 900 and 1,300. Regardless of the exact number, sources agree that the room was beyond its safety capacity.

Elsewhere in the club, patrons were enjoying gourmet meals. Later estimates place the total number of people in the Beverly Hills Supper Club on May 28, 1977, at approximately 3,000, substantially more than the 1,500 people fire code allowed at the time for a building with the number of exits the club had.

Near the south exit close to the main bar, the opposite end of the building from the Cabaret Room, a wedding reception drew to a close around 8:30 p.m. in the Zebra Room, near the building&#x27;s main entrance; some of its guests had complained of the room being excessively warm with loud explosions from beneath the floor, and the group left the building before the end of their allotted time. The room remained vacant from their departure until 8:59 p.m., when an employee smelled smoke and opened the Zebra Room&#x27;s door to confirm the presence of smoke. She asked another employee to call the fire department while she and others grabbed fire extinguishers and began trying to fight the flames. Though the employees were not aware of it, their opening of the Zebra Room&#x27;s door allowed enough oxygen into the room to cause what had been a smoldering fire in the room&#x27;s drop ceiling to flashover and begin to spread rapidly. It quickly became clear that fire extinguishers were useless against the fast-growing blaze. The Fire Department was alerted to the fire at 9:01 p.m. and arrived by 9:05; as they approached, firefighters on the first emergency vehicles could already see smoke coming from the building.

As smoke began to escape the Zebra Room and drift down the hall toward other banquet rooms, patrons and employees nearest to the Zebra Room smelled it. The employees began to urge room occupants to leave the building. However, as the sprawling complex lacked an audible fire alarm, those in more isolated rooms had no way to know that there was a fire in the building until an employee walked the length of the building alerting them. Fire investigators later estimated that the fire, once it spread through the northern doors of the Zebra Room, took only two to five minutes to enter the Cabaret Room; as a result, news of the fire and the first of the smoke and flame reached the Cabaret Room, the farthest point from the Zebra Room, nearly simultaneously. By the time busboy Walter Bailey arrived in the Cabaret Room and interrupted the show to order an evacuation at 9:06 p.m., there was very little time left for the audience of around 1,000 people to leave via the room&#x27;s small number of exits. As it spread laterally, the fire also began to spread upwards, engulfing the spiral staircase that would have provided the best exit for those on the second floor of the building.

Around 9:10 p.m., power failed in the building, extinguishing the lights. Panic ensued, and even those who had been calmly moving toward exits in the Cabaret Room began to push and shove each other. The situation was made even more desperate because of the three exits in the room, two were soon blocked by the fire, leaving the crowd to funnel through a single exit. Employees outside the exits attempted to pull guests to safety, but the crush of bodies as those behind pushed upon those in front became so solid that no amount of strength could free most of them. Many of those who escaped the crush blocking the northeast fire exit became lost trying to find other exits. The building&#x27;s confusing design often led to a set of doors opening into a bar area that funneled frantic guests into a dead end.

Firefighters, alerted that the majority of the building&#x27;s occupants were in the Cabaret Room, focused their efforts there, but even the combined efforts of every fire department in the county were simply too little, too late. Temperatures in the Cabaret Room soared into the thousands of degrees and even firefighters, weary and dehydrated, were soon unable to safely attempt any further rescues.

At 11:30 p.m. fire command, suspecting that the building&#x27;s roof would soon collapse, ordered all firefighters to evacuate the building. At approximately midnight, the roof did indeed implode onto what remained of the building. The magnitude of the blaze was such that firefighters did not have the flames under control until around two o&#x27;clock that morning; parts of the building continued to burn until May 30, two days after the fire began.

== Victims ==
By the early morning of May 29, 134 bodies had been removed from the building and laid out, initially on the hillside surrounding the building and then in a makeshift morgue inside the nearby Fort Thomas Armory. By the end of June 1, 28 more bodies had been discovered, bringing the death toll up to 162. All but two of the dead were found in and around the Cabaret Room, with 125 clustered near the room&#x27;s north exit and another 34 at the room&#x27;s southern exit. Two bodies were removed from the Viennese Room. A small number of fire victims died after being rescued from the scene: one on June 25, and one on July 2. The last victim of the fire, Barbara Thornhill of Delhi Township, died on March 1, 1978, nine months after the tragedy. This brought the number of verified deaths to 165. 

==Investigation==

The investigation into the fire found the following deficiencies, as enumerated by &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;:

* Overcrowding. Although seating charts recovered from the club after the fire show that the Cabaret Room (the largest facility in the club) normally held between 614 and 756 people, a hostess who had worked at the club for several years estimated occupancy on the date in question to be well over 925.
* Inadequate fire exits. Full occupancy of the entire complex was estimated to be roughly 2,750, which under Kentucky law would require 28 exits (one for every hundred people). The club had fewer than 17 exits, many of which were not clearly marked nor easily reached. Some exits could be reached only by passing through three or more interior doors and corridors.
* Faulty wiring. Governor Julian Carroll&#x27;s report on the fire called the club&#x27;s wiring an &quot;electrician&#x27;s nightmare&quot;, and alleged multiple, wide-ranging code violations. Bridgetown electrician H. James Amend, who inspected the fire site at the request of a local attorney Stan Chesley a year and a half later said, &quot;I cannot believe that any of this was ever inspected.&quot;
* Lack of firewalls. This allowed the fire to spread, and in addition allowed it to draw oxygen from other areas of the complex.
* Poor construction practices. The club had been built piecemeal with inadequate roof support, no common ceiling space, and highly flammable components.
* Extreme safety code violations. There was no sprinkler system and no audible automatic fire alarm.
* Poor oversight by regulatory authorities. The local volunteer fire department is said by the &quot;Enquirer&quot; to have known of the deficiencies, but by law, at the time, did not have the authority to compel corrections.

===Lawsuit===
This was the first lawsuit to use the concept of &quot;enterprise liability&quot; and one of the first disaster suits to be brought as a class action. Chief litigation attorney Stanley Chesley raised millions through the class action, benefiting many survivors.

==Aftermath==

Richard Whitt of the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; was awarded the 1978 Pulitzer Prize for Local General or Spot News Reporting for his articles on the fire. His citation reads: &quot;For his coverage of a fire that took 164 lives at the Beverly Hills Supper Club at Southgate, Ky., and subsequent investigation of the lack of enforcement of state fire codes.&quot;

In a letter dated July 8, 2011, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway ordered a retired Kentucky State Police forensic specialist to return 30 boxes of color slides taken in the days after the fire, including pictures of the club&#x27;s basement during the aftermath, which the forensic specialist had taken personal possession of following his retirement from the State Police. Conway&#x27;s decision was that these documents were public records, and must be handled and made available to the public in accordance with Kentucky&#x27;s Open Records Act.

A state historic marker commemorates the fire. Although off limits to the public, the site was a popular destination for urban explorers, many of whom have found relics from the club.

In 2020, a private developer reached a deal with the City of Southgate to build a mixed-use development on the site. First responders, families of fire victims, and others filed a lawsuit in September 2020 to halt the project, but came to an agreement in November 2020, allowing the project to move forward. In May 2023, a permanent memorial is inaugurated near the development&#x27;s northern access road.

=== Later arson allegations ===

Author Robert D. Webster, along with co-authors David Brock and Thomas McConaughy, in their 2012 investigative history &quot;Beverly Hills Supper Club: The Untold Story of Kentucky&#x27;s Worst Tragedy&quot;, alleges that the fire was actually set deliberately by the mafia, in retaliation for the Supper Club&#x27;s owner&#x27;s refusing to sell the venue to them. Webster and McConaughy began their investigation at the behest of David Brock, who had been a busboy at the venue on the night of the fire and claimed to have seen unidentified &quot;maintenance men&quot; working in the ceiling of one of the party rooms shortly before the fire broke out. Webster was awarded a 2013 Kentucky History Award for his work on their book.

Brock&#x27;s allegations had previously been presented to Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear in 2008 by a group called &quot;the Beverly Hills Survivors for Justice&quot;. Beshear appointed a special Governor&#x27;s Review Team, which reviewed the allegations and evidence with assistance from the Office of Inspector General of the Kentucky Public Protection, Environment and Energy, and Labor Cabinets. This Review Team&#x27;s final report on the matter described the allegations as &quot;a very tiny shred of evidence of arson and a huge mountain of conjecture, unsupported speculation, and personal opinion&quot; which &quot;fall[s] many miles short of the kind of proof that would be needed to justify a ... re-investigation...&quot;

<text>Circaetinae is a subfamily of the family Accipitridae which contains a group of medium to large broad-winged birds of prey. The group is sometimes treated as tribe Circaetini. These birds mainly specialise in feeding on snakes and other reptiles, which is the reason most are referred to as &quot;snake-eagles&quot; or &quot;serpent-eagles&quot;. The exceptions are the bateleur, a more generalised hunter, and the Philippine eagle, which preys on mammals and birds.

All but one of the subfamily are restricted to warmer parts of the Old World: &quot;Spilornis&quot; and &quot;Pithecophaga&quot; in south Asia, the others in Africa. The short-toed eagle &quot;Circaetus gallicus&quot; migrates between temperate Eurasia and Africa, as well as being resident in India.

They have hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs and powerful talons. They also have extremely keen eyesight to enable them to spot potential prey from a distance.

==Taxonomy==
The subfamily Circaetinae was introduced in 1851 by the English zoologist Edward Blyth with &quot;Circaetus&quot; as the type genus.

The genus level cladogram of the Circaetinae shown below is based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the Accipitridae by Therese Catanach and collaborators that was published in 2024.
The following taxonomy is based on the International Ornithological Congress.

<text>Édgar Ángel Vivar Villanueva (born 28 December 1948) is a Mexican actor and comedian. He is best known for his characters of Señor Barriga and his son Ñoño from &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;, and El Botija from &quot;Los Caquitos&quot; and &quot;Chespirito&quot;.

==Life and career==
The son of engineer Ángel Vivar and Celia Villanueva Falconi, Vivar started his acting career in 1964 as a theater actor. He toured the United States with some of his plays. This gave him vast experience in the acting field. In 1970, Chespirito needed a robust person to play Señor Barriga as well as Ñoño in his upcoming Televisa production of &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;, and Vivar was hired for the job.

Both shows became major international hits, allowing Vivar to become known beyond Mexico and to tour all over Latin America, Spain and the United States. He also made an attempt at becoming a telenovela actor, participating in his co-star Florinda Meza&#x27;s production, &quot;Alguna vez Tendremos Alas&quot;.

His weight caused him serious heart-related issues after the half-hour &quot;Chespirito&quot; productions were over in 1980 (it is believed that his temporary absence from the show may have related to his weight; and was explained that his character, el Botija, had gone to a weight-loss clinic.) In 1992, he left the hour-long &quot;Chespirito&quot; program briefly for therapy at a weight-loss clinic. He lost a great amount of weight, which helped save his life. He kept touring the countries where Chespirito shows were kept on television as re-runs after the show was over.

In 2006, Vivar appeared in the film &quot;Bandidas&quot; as a bank manager. He also co-starred in a telenovela made in Argentina, &quot;Amarte Así&quot;, that became a major success in South America, Spain, and the US. He had a role in Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s production of &quot;El Orfanato&quot;, filmed in Spain and released in October 2007. he would later voice Auguste Gusteau and Dug in the Latin American versions of Disney-Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Ratatouille&quot; and &quot;Up&quot; (2009).

In 2008, Vivar underwent gastric bypass surgery at a clinic in Colombia, and lost approximately 165 pounds. Following his surgery, he has become an advocate for healthy living, particularly for overcoming obesity.

Following his weight loss surgery, Vivar retired all of his &quot;Chespirito&quot; characters, stating that because of his weight loss, they were no longer appropriate. He would, however, reprise the voices of Señor Barriga and his son Ñoño for an episode of the animated adaptation of &quot;El Chavo&quot;, the only cast member from the original series to do so.

<doc id="441596" wikidata="Q7787810" url="?curid=441596" title="Thomas Bracken">
<text>Thomas Bracken ( December 1843 – 16 February 1898) was an Irish-born New Zealand poet, journalist and politician. He wrote &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot;, one of the two national anthems of New Zealand, and was the first person to publish the phrase &quot;God&#x27;s Own Country&quot; as applied to New Zealand. He also won the Otago Caledonian Society&#x27;s prize for poetry.

His mother Margaret died in 1846 and his father Thomas in 1852. He was sent to Australia at the age of 12 to join his uncle, John Kiernan, at Geelong, Victoria.

Bracken was apprenticed to a pharmacist in Bendigo, later moved around to work on farms as a shearer and drover, and for a time was a gold fossicker and store keeper. At that time he began writing tales over the activities of the diggers involved in the goldrush, and about stock men and sheep men. He also established Thomas Bracken and Co with Alexander Bathgate to buy and operate the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; until it was superseded in 1890 by the liberal &quot;Globe&quot;.

==Literary career==

In early 1869, at the age of 25, Bracken moved to Dunedin in New Zealand, where a volume containing a selection of poems he had written in Australia was published. While working as a shearer and at various odd jobs, he carried on writing, and published a small book of verses, &quot;Flights among the Flax&quot;. This was noticed in literary circles, and he won the Otago Caledonian Society&#x27;s prize for poetry.

Determined to enter journalism, Bracken took a staff position on the &quot;Otago Guardian&quot;. While at the &quot;Guardian&quot; he met John Bathgate who soon after, in 1875, established the &quot;Saturday Advertiser&quot; &quot;to foster a national spirit in New Zealand and encourage colonial literature&quot;. Bracken also wrote for the &quot;Morning Herald&quot; and the Catholic &quot;The New Zealand Tablet&quot;. He was born into a Catholic family, but lapsed, and was a freethinker and a freemason.

Bracken became editor and immediately began to encourage local writers; the &quot;Advertiser’s&quot; circulation reached 7,000 copies which was a notable achievement for that era. Encouraged by this literary and commercial success, Bracken contributed some of his own satire, humour and verse, including &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot;, published in 1876, which became the national anthem. He wrote &quot;Not Understood&quot; in 1879.

Although he often used the pseudonyms Paddy Murphy and Didymus, the prolific works under his own name soon became published worldwide and he became famous throughout Australia and New Zealand. Later publications of his works in bound editions included &quot;Flowers of the Freeland&quot;, &quot;Behind the Tomb and Other Poems&quot; (1871), &quot;The Land of the Maori and the Moa&quot; (or &quot;Lays of the Land of the Maori and Moa&quot;), &quot;Musings in Maoriland&quot; and &quot;Lays and Lyrics: God’s Own Country and Other Poems&quot; (1893).

A supporter of the egalitarian policies of Governor Sir George Grey, Bracken championed sovereignty for the native Māori people, and later criticised the government for what he saw to be breaches of its obligations to the Treaty of Waitangi.

He had arrived in New Zealand when colonial troops were engaged in war with Te Kooti, who went into battle under his own distinctive flag. It had three symbols that some claim were meant to signify stars. Bracken&#x27;s national anthem asks God to &quot;guard Pacific’s triple star&quot;, and some historians have reasoned that refers to Te Kooti&#x27;s flag and is his oblique support for Māori. It has also been suggested that &quot;Pacific’s triple star&quot; simply means the three main islands of New Zealand – Northern, Middle and Stewart as they were referred to at that time. Bracken never explained what he meant, so there is no definitive clarification today. (There have been suggestions that Bracken was referring to Alpha Centauri, the very bright triple star in the Milky Way, visible only in the Southern Hemisphere. That is impossible because Proxima Centauri, the third star in Alpha Centauri, was not discovered until 1915, some 39 years after Bracken wrote his anthem.)

==Political career==

Vitally interested in current events and politics, Bracken stood for Parliament in the electorate in the . He was unsuccessful at that time.

Bracken won the Dunedin Central electorate at the . He lost the seat by three votes to James Bradshaw at the , but when Bradshaw died in 1886, he won the and resumed his seat until the end of the term in 1887, when he retired.

Bracken was not a prudent person and eventually became financially embarrassed. He became a bill reader in Parliament in May 1894, but was forced to leave Wellington and return to Dunedin when his health deteriorated.

==Death==
Bracken died on the night of 16 February 1898, and is buried in the Dunedin Northern Cemetery. A lookout nearby, with views across the city, is named in his honour.

<text>The Accipitrinae are the subfamily of the Accipitridae often known as the &quot;true&quot; hawks. The subfamily contains 73 species that are divided into 11 genera. It includes the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot; which formerly included many more species. The large genus was found to be non-monophyletic and was split into several new or resurrected genera. The birds in this subfamily are primarily woodland birds that hunt by sudden dashes from a concealed perch, with long tails, broad wings and high visual acuity facilitating this lifestyle.

Hawks, including the accipitrines, are believed to have vision several times sharper than humans, in part because of the great number of photoreceptor cells in their retinas (up to 1,000,000 per square mm, against 200,000 for humans), a very high number of nerves connecting the receptors to the brain, and an indented fovea, which magnifies the central portion of the visual field.

A series of molecular phylogenetic studies found that the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot; was non-monophyletic. The results of a densely sampled 2024 study of the Accipitridae allowed the generic boundaries to be redefined. To create monophyletic genera, species were moved from &quot;Accipiter&quot; to five new or resurrected genera leaving only 9 species in &quot;Accipiter&quot;. The southeast Asian crested goshawk and the Sulawesi goshawk were found to be only distantly related to other species in &quot;Accipiter&quot;. They were moved to a resurrected genus &quot;Lophospiza&quot;, the only genus placed in the new subfamily Lophospizinae. Similarly, the very small south America tiny hawk and semicollared hawk were found to be only distantly related to species in &quot;Accipiter&quot;. They were moved to a newly erected genus &quot;Microspizias&quot; which together with &quot;Harpagus&quot; is placed in the subfamily Harpaginae. The genera &quot;Circus&quot;, &quot;Megatriorchis&quot;, and &quot;Erythrotriorchis&quot; were found to be nested within &quot;Accipiter&quot;. Rather than subsuming these genera into an expanded &quot;Accipiter&quot;, species were moved from &quot;Accipiter&quot; to the resurrected genera &quot;Aerospiza&quot;, &quot;Tachyspiza&quot; and &quot;Astur&quot;.

The genus level cladogram of the Accipitrinae shown below is based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the Accipitridae by Therese Catanach and collaborators that was published in 2024. The number of species in each genus is based on the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
== Species ==

The subfamily Accipitrinae contains 73 species that are arranged into 11 genera:
== Hawks and humans ==
Hawks are sometimes used in falconry, a sport in which trained birds of prey are flown at small game for sport.

<doc id="441599" wikidata="Q5575726" url="?curid=441599" title="God's Own Country">
<text>&quot;God&#x27;s Own Country&quot; is a phrase meaning an area, region or place supposedly favoured by God.

While its origins can be traced to various locations, the phrase has gained widespread recognition as a moniker for the Indian state of Kerala.

== Australia ==
In Australia, the phrase &quot;God&#x27;s own country&quot; was often used to describe the country in the early 1900s, but it appears to have gradually fallen out of favour. The phrase &quot;God&#x27;s Country&quot; is often used to describe Queensland and the Sutherland Shire in southern Sydney.

==Brazil ==
The idea of &quot;God&#x27;s own country&quot;, worded as &quot;&quot;Deus é brasileiro&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;God is Brazilian&quot;&quot;), is a common trope in Brazilian culture to inspire optimism and point out the country has vast resources but faces few natural disasters nor international conflict. It is referenced by politicians and artworks, as in the movie &quot;God Is Brazilian&quot;.

== England ==
When used in reference to England, &quot;God&#x27;s own country&quot; refers to the legend that as a boy Jesus visited England with his great uncle, Joseph of Arimathea. The event itself inspired the musical prelude to William Blake&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, the piece &quot;And did those feet in ancient time&quot;, also known as &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, which has become an unofficial anthem of England. The poem asks if Jesus did visit England in ancient times, and in so doing create the New Jerusalem, or heaven in England.

=== Surrey ===

Another first usage of the term by Edward du Bois was in a poem describing the English county of Surrey in 1839. The phrase was also used in its more literal meaning to refer to Heaven, in a poem by Elizabeth Harcourt Rolls Mitchell in 1857.

=== Yorkshire ===
The phrase has been used to describe Yorkshire, a region of northern England. The term &quot;God&#x27;s Own County&quot; has also been used.

==India==
===Kerala===


“God’s Own Country’ is the tagline of Kerala Tourism which was coined by Walter Mendez, the creative director of an Indian advertising agency in 1989 at the request of the Tourism Department, Government of Kerala.

This was used by agencies to showcase Kerala’s natural beauty and not-so-explored places across the state.

Kerala Tourism has won several awards for its innovative tourism campaign. Each of them depicted God’s Own Country in a new light, ensuring that the tagline continues to be associated with Kerala.

The description of Kerala as &quot;God&#x27;s own country&quot; can additionally be traced to the event known as Thrippadidanam in 1749, the then ruler Marthanda Varma, Maharaja of Travancore, decided to &quot;donate&quot; his realm to Padmanabha (Vishnu) and thereafter rule as the deity&#x27;s &quot;viceregent&quot; (Sri Padmanabha Dasa). (&#x27;Dasa&#x27; meaning Servant or Slave.).

==== Mythology ====
Apart from various legends of the origin of the Kerala, the slogan alludes to the variety of faiths in the state: Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Jains, Jews, and Parsis (Zoroastrians) have coexisted harmoniously for centuries, as attested by the mishmash of temples, towers, spires and synagogues.

The &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, one of the oldest of the 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting for the story of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region. These Puranic accounts portray Kerala as &quot;God’s own country&quot;, or the land favoured by God.

Another character from the &quot;Puranas&quot; associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king. According to regional belief, Mahabali ruled Kerala with great justice and was beloved by his people. However, the gods grew jealous of Mahabali&#x27;s growing fame and power, and feared he was becoming too powerful. They begged Lord Vishnu to stop Mahabali. Vishnu incarnated as Vamana and, playing on Mahabali&#x27;s benevolence, tricked Mahabali into giving up his kingdom, and exiled him to Patala, the netherworld. Vishnu, seeing the devotion of Mahabali, blessed him to be the Indra of the next Manvantara and granted him his request that once a year, during the Onam festival, Mahabali could return to his kingdom to visit his people. It is said that Vishnu guards Mahabali&#x27;s kingdom as a mark of respect for his virtues.

Kerala (Chera-nadu) is prominently referenced in the Tamil Epic Cilappatikaram. The Heroine Kannagi after suffering innumerable injustices travels over the hills to Kerala, where the Gods and Goddesses receive her and take her to heaven. The deity at the Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple is worshipped as Kannagi Amma.

Another legend, from the 17th century Malayalam work &quot;Keralolpathi&quot;, tells that the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior-sage Parashurama, the sixth avatar of the deity Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parashurama Kshetram; &#x27;The Land of Parashurama&#x27;). According to legend, Parashurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. This new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and was unsuitable for habitation; so Parashurama invoked the snake-king Vasuki, who spat the holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land.

==New Zealand==

The earliest recorded use of the phrase as applied to New Zealand was as the title of a poem about New Zealand written by Thomas Bracken. It was published in a book of his poems in 1890, and again in 1893 in a book entitled &quot;Lays and Lyrics: God&#x27;s Own Country and Other Poems.&quot; God&#x27;s Own Country as a phrase was often used and popularised by New Zealand&#x27;s longest serving prime minister, Richard John Seddon. He last quoted it on 10 June 1906 when he sent a telegram to the Victorian premier, Thomas Bent, the day before leaving Sydney to return home to New Zealand. &quot;Just leaving for God&#x27;s own country,&quot; he wrote. He never made it, dying the next day on the ship &quot;Oswestry Grange&quot;. Bracken&#x27;s &quot;God&#x27;s Own Country&quot; is less well known internationally than &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot;, which he published in 1876. The latter poem, set to music by John Joseph Woods, was declared the country&#x27;s national hymn in 1940, and made the second national anthem of New Zealand along with &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; in 1977.

In recent times, the form Godzone on its own has been used informally of New Zealand.

==United States ==
The phrase was also sporadically used to describe several American regions. Most known is the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It is currently used to describe South Boston. It was also used by the Confederate army to describe parts of Tennessee in the 1860s. The phrase was also used to describe California in the 1860s, and by Clement Laird Vallandigham to describe the land of the Mississippi plains. None of these remain widely used to describe a region, though it is still occasionally used to describe the United States overall.

During World War II, German Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels sarcastically mocked the US as &quot;&quot;Aus Gottes eigenem Land&quot; (From God&#x27;s Own Country) in an essay that appeared in the German newspaper &quot;Das Reich&quot; on 9 August 1942. Goebbels ridiculed the United States as a young land that lacked culture, education and history in contrast with Germany. In 1943, the Nazis published an anti-American, antisemitic propaganda book written by &quot;Erwin Berghaus&quot; called &quot;USA – nackt!: Bilddokumente aus Gottes eigenem Land&quot;&quot; (&quot;USA naked! Photo documents from God&#x27;s own country&quot;) which also mockingly characterized the US with the phrase. Several modern German newspapers such as &quot;Die Welt&quot;, &quot;Der Tagesspiegel&quot; and &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, have also used the phrase &quot;Gottes eigenes Land&quot; (&quot;God&#x27;s own country&quot;) to criticize American culture and society.

==Zimbabwe==
The phrase &quot;God&#x27;s own country&quot; was heard during the 1970s in Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia), where most people perceived the land as beautiful despite the ongoing Bush War of the time. Evidence of the phrase being used earlier in reference to Rhodesia is found in &quot;Chartered Millions: Rhodesia and the Challenge to the British Commonwealth&quot; by John Hobbis Harris, published 1920 by Swarthmore Press (refer to page 27). The phrase &quot;Godzone&quot; is distinctly different and was not used in Rhodesia.

<text>The Malbone Street wreck, also known as the Brighton Beach Line accident, was a rapid transit railroad accident that occurred on November 1, 1918, on the New York City Subway&#x27;s BMT Brighton Line (now part of the BMT Franklin Avenue Line) in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City. A speeding train derailed in the sharply curved tunnel beneath Willink Plaza, the intersection of Flatbush Avenue, Ocean Avenue, and Malbone Street (now known as Empire Boulevard). At least 93 people died, making it the second-deadliest train crash in American history, as well as the deadliest crash in the history of the New York City Subway.

The circumstances leading to the crash included a labor strike against the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT). The BRT had tried to keep service running with non-striking personnel, and decided to use Antonio Edward Luciano, a crew dispatcher with no experience operating the line. Other factors in the crash included the serpentine layout of the track and the weight of the individual train cars.

In the aftermath of the crash, Luciano and BRT officials were placed on trial for manslaughter. Ultimately, all the defendants were acquitted or their indictments were dropped. The BRT gradually phased out wooden cars and additional train protection devices were installed. The two most heavily damaged train cars were scrapped. In 1923, the BRT became the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, having gone bankrupt due to the accident. The tunnel in which the wreck occurred remained in daily passenger operation for forty years. A memorial to the crash was installed in 2019.

==Incident==
The Malbone Street wreck occurred on Friday, November 1, 1918, at 6:42p.m., during the end-of-week rush hour, and involved about 650 passengers. The elevated train, consisting of five cars constructed primarily of wood, entered the tunnel portal beneath Malbone Street, going toward the Prospect Park station, negotiating a reverse curve designated to be taken at at a speed estimated at between .

The back wheels of the first car derailed, and the two following cars completely left the tracks, tearing off their left-hand sides and most of their roofs. The first and fourth cars sustained relatively minor damage, while the second and third cars were severely damaged. The fifth suffered no damage at all. The motorman, 25-year-old Antonio Edward Luciano, was not injured and left the scene of the accident. Passengers were trapped in what &quot;The New York Times&quot; later described as &quot;a darkened jungle of steel dust and wood splinters, glass shards and iron beams projecting like bayonets.&quot;

One surviving passenger, lawyer Charles Darling, had become so concerned about the train&#x27;s speed that he dropped to the floor and braced himself moments before the crash. Darling later confronted Luciano and asked the motorman what had gone wrong. &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; Luciano told Darling. &quot;I lost control of the damn thing. That&#x27;s all.&quot;

It took forty-five minutes for all rescuers to descend to the site of the accident. The nearest hospital was at capacity with patients from the Spanish flu epidemic, and a makeshift infirmary was set up at Ebbets Field for crash injuries.

==Causes==
The Malbone Street wreck was the result of a series of individual circumstances.

=== Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers strike ===
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, representing some of the motormen operating elevated trains of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), had just gone on strike that morning, November 1, over issues involving union organizing and the discharge from employment of twenty-nine of its members. This created a shortage of motormen to operate the system. The BRT elected to keep service running with non-striking personnel, which included men in other unions, including the company union. Hours after the crash occurred, and less than 24 hours after the strike began, it was discontinued.

=== Motorman&#x27;s lack of experience ===
Luciano, the derailed train&#x27;s motorman, was a crew dispatcher who was pressed into service during the strike. He had never operated an elevated train in passenger service before, was not familiar with the Brighton Beach Line, and his only experience moving trains was parking non-revenue trains in a train yard a year earlier. Luciano had received less than three hours of classroom instruction in being a motorman, and was never officially certified as one. The norm was no fewer than 90 hours of instruction and hands-on training.

In addition to his inexperience, Luciano was mourning the death of his infant daughter who had been a victim of the Spanish flu epidemic and whose funeral had been three days before, while Luciano himself was recovering from a recent bout of the flu.

=== Tunnel layout ===
The single-track tunnel in which the wreck occurred had been opened only weeks before the accident. It consisted of a sharp curve designed to take Coney Island-bound trains of the Brighton Beach Line around a new underground mainline, which was under construction. Previously, trains entered Prospect Park southbound through the original tunnel, which provided a straighter, more direct route. Trains going northbound continued to come out of Prospect Park using the original track and straighter tunnel, still in use. Shortly following the crash, engineers were sent to investigate whether the curved tunnel may have been of faulty construction.

=== Train coupling ===
The train consisted of three motor cars and two trailer cars. The motor cars were about twice as heavy as the trailer cars, and the trailers were more top-heavy, especially with a passenger load. Standard procedure was to avoid coupling two trailer cars together by having a single trailer between two motor cars. The heavier motor cars provided stability for the lighter trailers. In the train that derailed, two trailers were coupled together, sandwiched between motor cars on either end of the train. The trailer cars – numbered 80 and 100 – sustained the bulk of the damage and fatalities, while the two motor cars at the rear of the train did not derail.

=== Train speed ===
The train was operating at at least , or 5 times the speed limit, when it derailed. The accident occurred within the reverse curve, which had a speed limit of . Luciano said during his interview that he had attempted to slow the train, but the subsequent investigation of the wreck indicated that he had not attempted to engage the emergency brake or to reverse the train&#x27;s motors. Witnesses interviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; also said that the train had not slowed approaching or in the S-curve until the cars left the tracks. In the minutes leading up to the wreck, Luciano had difficulty timing the train&#x27;s progress, overshooting multiple stations. Bypassing the Consumers Park station (today Botanic Garden) meant Luciano wouldn&#x27;t apply the brakes as the train descended a 70-foot incline from Crown Heights to the tunnel near the Willink Plaza entrance to Prospect Park.

== Investigation and trial ==

Mayor John F. Hylan and his administration blamed the BRT and brought Luciano and company officials to trial for manslaughter. The Brooklyn District Attorney, Harry E. Lewis, opened a separate investigation into the crash.

In a December 1918 meeting, members of the Brighton Elevated Wreck Victims and Passengers&#x27; Protective Association were allegedly heard saying, &quot;Kill them! Shoot them!&quot; in response to a proposed change of venue for the trial, but the association denied the allegation. Meanwhile, several BRT officers were held on bail before the trial. Upon the request of the former BRT president, Timothy S. Williams, the trial&#x27;s location was changed from Brooklyn to the town of Mineola in Nassau County. This was done to ensure the BRT officials&#x27; right to a fair trial, by holding the legal proceedings as far away from Brooklyn as possible.

The trial opened in March 1919. The prosecutorial focus required the BRT to present a coherent defense on behalf of both its officials and Luciano. Because of this, neither the proximate cause of the wreck nor the excessive speed of the train was adequately explained. Luciano testified on his own behalf, contending that he was in control of the train but that the train did not respond properly. This opposed the BRT&#x27;s own physical examination of the equipment, which showed that the brakes were in good operating order, were not placed in &quot;emergency&quot; application, and that other means of slowing or stopping the train, such as reversing the motors, had not been attempted. Since his defense focused on these contentions, other issues that could have caused him to operate the train at excessive speed were not examined, such as his insomnia, a desire to make up time because of earlier switching problems, or his unfamiliarity with the route on which he was operating.

In May 1919, the BRT settled with the widows of two victims, followed by payouts to more victims that October. The same December, the BRT was ordered to pay out another $1.2 million in damages. By 1921, all of the defendants had been acquitted or had their indictments dropped. One official, BRT vice president John J. Dempsey, received a hung jury and was not retried. By March 1921, the BRT had a combined $75 million in crash-related liens, and was out of funding to pay further claims. The BRT later went into receivership, which ended in early 1923. The Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), which succeeded the BRT, ended up being responsible for paying the BRT&#x27;s outstanding claims, a plan that was approved in September 1923. The BMT disbursed $1.6 million that year. The highest settlement was $40,000, , which went to the widow of Floyd G. Ten Broeck, a 47-year-old engineer who designed and built power plants and paper mills.

==Aftermath==
The Malbone Street wreck remains the deadliest crash in the New York City Subway&#x27;s history, as well as one of the worst rapid transit crashes in the history of the United States. The reported death toll ranged from 93 to 102, with about 250 injuries. A report more than three years after the accident concluded that 91 people were killed.

=== Equipment and infrastructure changes ===
The accident placed more pressure on the BRT to remove wooden equipment from routes that operated through tunnel sections or in subways, though this use was already limited. Wooden cars returned to use in the tunnel for another nine years, and cars of partial wooden construction remained in elevated service until 1969. Additional safety devices were added to the subway and elevated system over the years, including speedometers, headlights, more effective dead-man&#x27;s controls to halt runaway trains, and automatic trackside devices called trippers or train stops to reduce the likelihood of trains operating too fast for conditions. Further, additional subway signals were installed on New York City elevated lines.

The three motor cars involved in the wreck—lead car 726, fourth car 725, and final car 1064—were repaired and returned to service. The severely damaged trailers, 100 and 80, were scrapped; car 80 was cut up on-site during the wreck cleanup.

=== Fate of Luciano ===
Luciano adopted the name Anthony Lewis and became a house builder in Queens Village, Queens. He retired in Tucson, Arizona, where he died in 1985 at the age of 91.

=== Site ===

In the wake of the tragedy, the Board of Alderman approved the renaming of most of Malbone Street to Empire Boulevard at the beginning of December 1918, scarcely a month after the wreck, a name it still bears. A detached one-block section of the street in Crown Heights still bears the original &quot;Malbone Street&quot; name. The Malbone Street tunnel, in which the wreck occurred, remained in daily passenger operation for 40 years, as part of the original BMT Brighton Line until 1920, then as part of the BMT Franklin Avenue Line. The tunnel today is still a part of that line, which runs the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, but is not used in regular passenger service.

A streetcar crash coincidentally occurred about a half block away on Flatbush Avenue in 1920, a collision that killed one person and injured seventy. In 1974, another accident at the same site, involving a split switch rather than an over-speeding condition, occurred when a slow-speed train of R32 subway cars derailed and hit the wall. There were no injuries, but a damaged car was scrapped.

On November 1, 2019, officials installed a permanent bronze memorial plaque at the northern exit of the Prospect Park station, and co-named the corner of Empire Boulevard and Flatbush Avenue as &quot;Malbone Centennial Way&quot;. The plaque inscription reads:
Remembering the Malbone Street Wreck
In memory of those who lost their lives near this location on November 1, 1918, when a wooden-bodied train carrying an estimated 650 passengers derailed and crashed under Malbone Street. Nearly 100 people were killed, and nearby Ebbets Field was turned into a makeshift hospital to care for the hundreds injured. This horrific accident led to meaningful reforms and advancements in transit safety, training and infrastructure. As a result of this tragedy, Malbone Street was eventually renamed and is today known as Empire Boulevard.

== In popular culture ==
In 2018, the &quot;Park Slope Reader&quot;, a local Brooklyn newspaper, serialized the &quot;Tales of the Night Watchman&quot; comic strip, &quot;The Ghost Train&quot;, about the elevated train involved in the infamous wreck returning to terrorize the city in the present. The story debuted in the paper&#x27;s Spring 2018 edition, number 64. It was written by Dave Kelly, drawn by Simon Fraser, and colored by Gary Caldwell.

<text>The Constitution of South Africa is the supreme law of the Republic of South Africa. It provides the legal foundation for the existence of the republic, it sets out the human rights and duties of its citizens, and defines the structure of the Government. The current constitution, the country&#x27;s fifth, was drawn up by the Parliament elected in 1994 general election. It was promulgated by President Nelson Mandela on 18 December 1996 and came into effect on 4 February 1997, replacing the Interim Constitution of 1993. The first constitution was enacted by the South Africa Act 1909, the longest-lasting to date. Since 1961, the constitutions have promulgated a republican form of government.

Since 1997, the Constitution has been amended by eighteen amendments. The Constitution is formally entitled the &quot;Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.&quot; It was previously also numbered as if it were an Act of ParliamentAct No. 108 of 1996but, since the passage of the Citation of Constitutional Laws Act, neither it nor the acts amending it are allocated act numbers.

== History ==

===Previous Constitutions of South Africa===

The South Africa Act 1909, an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, unified four British coloniesCape Colony, Transvaal Colony, Orange River Colony and Natal Colonyinto the Union of South Africa, a self-governing dominion.

The Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1961 transformed the union into a republic, replacing the Queen with a State President, but otherwise leaving the system of government largely unchanged. In a referendum, the first national election with a solely white electorate, the Act was narrowly approved, with a substantial minority in the Cape province and a strong majority in Natal opposing it.

The Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1983, again approved by a whites-only referendum, created the Tricameral Parliament, with separate houses representing Whites, Coloureds and Indians but without representation for Blacks. The figurehead State President and executive Prime Minister were merged into an executive State President, chosen by parliament. This characteristic remains to date and is nearly unique to South Africa (one exception being neighbouring Botswana).

The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 or Interim Constitution was introduced at the end of apartheid to govern the period of transition. It introduced, for the first time, the framework of a liberal democracy, universal adult suffrage and a bill of rights.

=== Negotiations ===

An integral part of the negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa was the creation of a new constitution. One of the major disputed issues was the process by which such a constitution would be adopted. The African National Congress (ANC) insisted that it should be drawn up by a democratically elected constituent assembly, while the governing National Party (NP) feared that the rights of minorities would not be protected in such a process, and proposed instead that the constitution be negotiated by consensus between the parties and then put to a referendum.

Formal negotiations began in December 1991 at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA). The parties agreed on a process whereby a negotiated transitional constitution would provide for an elected constitutional assembly to draw up a permanent constitution. The CODESA negotiations broke down, however, after the second plenary session in May 1992. One of the major points of dispute was the size of the supermajority that would be required for the assembly to adopt the constitution: The NP wanted a 75 per cent requirement, which would effectively have given it a veto.

In April 1993, the parties returned to negotiations, in what was known as the Multi-Party Negotiating Process (MPNP). A committee of the MPNP proposed the development of a collection of &quot;constitutional principles&quot; with which the final constitution would have to comply, so that basic freedoms would be ensured and minority rights protected, without overly limiting the role of the elected constitutional assembly. The parties to the MPNP adopted this idea and proceeded to draft the Interim Constitution of 1993, which was formally enacted by Parliament and came into force on 27 April 1994.

=== Interim Constitution ===

The Interim Constitution provided for a Parliament made up of two houses: a 400-member National Assembly, directly elected by party-list proportional representation, and a ninety-member Senate, in which each of the nine provinces was represented by ten Senators, elected by the provincial legislature. The Constitutional Assembly consisted of both houses sitting together, and was responsible for drawing up a final constitution within two years. The adoption of a new constitutional text required a two-thirds supermajority in the Constitutional Assembly, as well as the support of two-thirds of senators on matters relating to provincial government. If a two-thirds majority could not be obtained, a constitutional text could be adopted by a simple majority and then put to a national referendum in which sixty per cent support would be required for it to pass.

The Interim Constitution contained 34 constitutional principles with which the new constitution was required to comply. These included multi-party democracy with regular elections and universal adult suffrage, supremacy of the constitution over all other law, a quasi-federal system in place of centralised government, non-racism and non-sexism, the protection of &quot;all universally accepted fundamental rights, freedoms and civil liberties,&quot; equality before the law, the separation of powers with an impartial judiciary, provincial and local levels of government with democratic representation, and protection of the diversity of languages and cultures. The Bill of Rights, now in Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa, was largely written by Kader Asmal and Albie Sachs. The new constitutional text was to be tested against these principles by the newly established Constitutional Court. If the text complied with the principles, it would become the new constitution; if it did not, it would be referred back to the Constitutional Assembly.

=== Final text ===

The Constitutional Assembly engaged in a massive public participation programme to solicit views and suggestions from the public. As the deadline for the adoption of a constitutional text approached, however, many issues were hashed out in private meetings between the parties&#x27; representatives. On 8 May 1996, a new text was adopted with the support of 86 per cent of the members of the assembly, but in the &quot;First Certification&quot; judgment, delivered on 6 September 1996, the Constitutional Court refused to certify this text. The Constitutional Court identified a number of provisions that did not comply with the constitutional principles. Areas of non-compliance included failures to protect the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining; to provide for the constitutional review of ordinary statutes; to entrench fundamental rights, freedoms and civil liberties and to sufficiently safeguard the independence of the Public Protector and Auditor-General as well as other areas of non-compliance in relation to local government responsibilities and powers.

The Constitutional Assembly reconvened and, on 11 October, adopted an amended constitutional text containing many changes relative to the previous text. Some dealt with the court&#x27;s reasons for non-certification, while others tightened up the text. The amended text was returned to the Constitutional Court to be certified, which the court duly did in its &quot;Second Certification&quot; judgment, delivered on 4 December. The Constitution was signed by President Mandela on 10 December and officially published in the &quot;Government Gazette&quot; on 18 December. It did not come into force immediately; it was brought into operation on 4 February 1997, by a presidential proclamation, except for some financial provisions which were delayed until 1 January 1998.

== Contents ==

The constitution consists of a preamble, fourteen chapters containing 244 sections, and eight schedules. Each chapter deals with a particular topic; the schedules contain ancillary information referred to in the main text.
=== Preamble ===
The preamble constitution is as follows:
=== Chapter 1: Founding Provisions ===

Chapter 1 enshrines in the constitution key national principles, defines the country&#x27;s flag and national anthem, and specifies the official languages and principles of government language policy. It defines South Africa as &quot;one, sovereign, democratic state&quot; based on principles of human rights, constitutional supremacy, the rule of law and universal adult suffrage. The chapter contains a supremacy clause which establishes that all other law and actions are subject to the constitution.

=== Chapter 2: Bill of Rights ===

Chapter 2 is a bill of rights which enumerates the civil, political, economic, social and cultural human rights of the people of South Africa. Most of these rights apply to anyone in the country, with the exception of the right to vote, the right to work and the right to enter the country, which apply only to citizens. They also apply to juristic persons to the extent that they are applicable, taking into account the nature of the right. The rights enumerated are:

* Section 9: everyone is equal before the law and has right to equal protection and the benefit of the law. Prohibited grounds of discrimination include race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth.
* Section 10: the right to human dignity.
* Section 11: the right to life
* Section 12: the right to freedom and security of the person, including protection against arbitrary detention and detention without trial, the right to be protected against violence, freedom from torture, freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to bodily integrity, and reproductive rights.

* Section 17: freedom of assembly and the right to protest.
* Section 18: freedom of association.
* Section 19: the right to vote and universal adult suffrage; the right to stand for public office; the right to free, fair and regular elections; and the right to form, join and campaign for a political party.
* Section 20: no citizen may be deprived of citizenship.
* Section 21: freedom of movement, including the right to leave South Africa, the right of citizens to a passport and the right to enter South Africa.
* Section 22: the right to choose a trade, occupation or profession, although these may be regulated by law.
* Section 23: labour rights, including the right to unionise and the right to strike.
* Section 24: the right to a healthy environment protected.
* Section 25: the right to property, limited in that property may only be expropriated under a law of general application (not arbitrarily), for a public purpose and with the payment of compensation.
* Section 26: the right to housing, including the right to due process with regard to court-ordered eviction and demolition.
* Section 27: the rights to food, water, health care and social assistance, which the state must progressively realise within the limits of its resources.
* Section 28: children&#x27;s rights, including the right to a name and nationality, the right to family or parental care, the right to a basic standard of living, the right to be protected from maltreatment and abuse, the protection from inappropriate child labour, the right not to be detained except as a last resort, the paramountcy of the best interests of the child and the right to an independent lawyer in court cases involving the child, and the prohibition of the military use of children.
* Section 29: the right to education, including a universal right to basic education.
* Section 30: the right to use the language of one&#x27;s choice and to participate in the cultural life of one&#x27;s choice.

* Section 33: the right to justice in administrative action by the government.
* Section 34: the right of access to the courts.
* Section 35: the rights of arrested, detained and accused people, including the right to silence, protection against self-incrimination, the right to counsel and legal aid, the right to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence and the prohibition of double jeopardy and &quot;ex post facto&quot; crimes.

Section 36 allows the rights listed to be limited only by laws of general application, and only to the extent that the restriction is reasonable and justifiable in &quot;an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom.&quot;

Section 37 allows certain rights to be limited during a state of emergency but places strict procedural limits on the declaration of states of emergency and provides for the rights of people detained as a result.

=== Chapter 3: Co-operative Government ===

Chapter 3 deals with the relationships between organs of government in the three &quot;spheres&quot;national, provincial and local. It lays down a set of principles requiring them to co-operate in good faith and to act in the best interests of the people. It also requires them to attempt to settle disputes amicably before resorting to the courts.

=== Chapter 4: Parliament ===

Chapter 4 defines the structure of Parliament, the legislative branch of the national government. Parliament consists of two houses, the National Assembly (the lower house), which is directly elected by the people, and the National Council of Provinces (the upper house), which is elected by the provincial legislatures.

The Chapter defines the principles governing the election and dissolution of the houses, qualifications for membership of Parliament, quorum requirements, procedures for the election of presiding officers, and the powers and privileges and immunities of Parliament and its members. It lays down the process for enacting bills into law; different procedures are provided for constitutional amendments, ordinary bills not affecting provincial matters, ordinary bills affecting provincial matters, and money bills.

=== Chapter 5: The President and National Executive ===

Chapter 5 defines the structure of the national executive and the powers of the President. It provides for the election and removal of the President by the National Assembly, and limits a President to two five-year terms. It vests in him or her the powers of the head of state and head of government; it provides for the appointment of a Cabinet by the President; and it provides for the accountability to Parliament of the President and Cabinet.

=== Chapter 6: Provinces ===

Chapter 6 establishes the nine provinces of South Africa and defines the powers and structure of the provincial governments. The boundaries of the provinces are defined by reference to Schedule 1A to the Constitution, which refers in turn to the boundaries of the metropolitan and district municipalities.

In some respects, the chapter is a template which a province may modify to a limited extent by adopting its own provincial constitution. (The only province so far to have done this is the Western Cape.) The chapter provides for a unicameral legislature, a Premier elected by the legislature as head of the provincial executive, and an Executive Council appointed by the Premier as a provincial cabinet.

The provincial government is given exclusive powers over certain matters, listed in Schedule 5, and powers concurrent with the national government over other matters, listed in Schedule 4. The chapter regulates the conflict between national and provincial legislation on the same topic, setting out the circumstances under which one or the other will prevail.

=== Chapter 7: Local Government ===

Chapter 7 sets out a framework for local government. It requires municipalities to be established for the whole territory of South Africa, and provides for three categories of municipalities, whereby some areas are governed by a single &quot;Category A&quot; municipal authority and others are governed by a two-level system with a larger &quot;Category C&quot; municipality containing multiple &quot;Category B&quot; municipalities. The municipalities are granted the power to administer certain matters listed in Schedules 4 and 5, and the executive and legislative authority is vested in the municipal council. The chapter requires municipal elections to be held every five years.

=== Chapter 8: Courts and Administration of Justice ===

Chapter 8 establishes the structure of the judicial system. It defines the hierarchy consisting of Magistrates&#x27; Courts, the High Court, the Supreme Court of Appeal, and the Constitutional Court. It provides for the appointment of judges by the President on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission and establishes a single National Prosecuting Authority responsible for all criminal prosecutions.

=== Chapter 9: State Institutions Supporting Constitutional Democracy ===

Chapter 9 creates a number of other commissions and offices to protect and support democracy and human rights. These are the Public Protector (an ombudsman), the South African Human Rights Commission, the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities, the Commission for Gender Equality, the Auditor-General, the Independent Electoral Commission and the Independent Communications Authority.

=== Chapter 10: Public Administration ===

Chapter 10 lists values and principles for the administration of the civil service and establishes the Public Service Commission to oversee it.

=== Chapter 11: Security Services ===

Chapter 11 establishes structures for civilian control of the Defence Force, the Police Service and the intelligence services. It makes the President the Commander-in-Chief of the defence force but places conditions on when and how it may be employed and requires regular reports to Parliament. The police service is placed under the control of the national government but gives provincial governments some power to administer and oversee policing.

=== Chapter 12: Traditional Leaders ===

Chapter 12 recognizes the status and authority of traditional leaders and customary law, subject to the Constitution. It allows for the creation of provincial houses of traditional leaders and a national council of traditional leaders.

The Traditional leaders must have responsibilities in affairs and decision making of the municipality in order to build proper sustainable development to the people that resides on that municipality. Because we have Traditional leaders that do not have daily duties day in and day out; in short they must be part of mayoral council.

=== Chapter 13: Finance ===

Chapter 13 deals with public finance. It establishes a National Revenue Fund, from which money may be appropriated only by an act of Parliament, and Provincial Revenue Funds, from which money may only be appropriated by an act of the provincial legislature. It provides for an equitable distribution of national revenue to the provinces and municipalities, and grants provincial and local governments the powers to raise certain rates and taxes. It requires effective and transparent budgeting at all levels of government and gives the National Treasury the power to oversee budgetary processes. It places some restrictions on government procurement and government borrowing. The chapter establishes the Financial and Fiscal Commission, to advise government on financial matters, and the Reserve Bank, to oversee the currency.

Economist Jacques Jonker has criticised the provisions of Chapter 13 as being insufficient to guard against fiscal imprudence, and has suggested that it be amended in line with other constitutions such as that of Spain in order to enforce fiscal discipline.

===Chapter 14: General Provisions===

The final chapter deals with transitional and incidental provisions. In particular, the first part deals with international law, providing that existing agreements binding South Africa will continue to bind it, and that new agreements (except those of a technical nature) will only be binding once approved by Parliament. It also provides that customary international law applies in South African unless it conflicts with national law, and that the courts must, where possible, interpret national law to be consistent with international law.

The remainder of the chapter contains a miscellaneous collection of provisions,

* allowing Parliament to enact Charters of Rights which expand on the Bill of Rights;
* allowing recognition of the right of self-determination of communities within South Africa;
* requiring public funding for political parties represented in national and provincial legislatures;
* requiring that obligations imposed by the constitution be carried out without delay;
* providing that some executive powers may be delegated by one organ of state to another;
* defining certain terms used in the text of the constitution; and,
* as the Constitution is published in all eleven official languages, providing that the English text is authoritative in the event of a conflict.

Chapter 14 also repeals the Interim Constitution and refers to Schedule 6 to govern the process of transition to the new Constitution. Finally, it gives the Constitution its formal title, &quot;Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996,&quot; and defines the schedule for its commencement, under which the President set the date of commencement for most sections, although certain sections dealing with financial matters commenced only on 1 January 1998.

=== Schedules ===

* Schedule 1, referred to in Chapter 1, describes the national flag.
* Schedule 1A, referred to in Chapter 6, defines the geographical areas of the provinces, by reference to maps published by the Municipal Demarcation Board defining the metropolitan and district municipalities.
* Schedule 2 contains the texts of the oaths or solemn affirmations to be sworn by political office-holders and judges.
* Schedule 3 describes the procedure for the election of the President by the National Assembly and the election of presiding officers by legislative bodies, as well as the formula whereby seats in the National Council of Provinces are to be allocated to political parties.
* Schedule 4 lists the &quot;functional areas&quot; over which Parliament and the provincial legislatures have concurrent competence to legislate.
* Schedule 5 lists the functional areas over which the provincial legislatures have exclusive competence to legislate.
* Schedule 6 details the transitional arrangements by which institutions existing under the previous constitution were converted into the institutions established by the new constitution. It provides for the continuation of existing laws and the assignment of their administration to the provincial governments where appropriate. It also provides for certain sections of the old constitution to continue in force despite its repeal, and subject to amendments listed in the schedule. It also includes temporary amendments to the Constitution&#x27;s own text which allowed the Government of National Unity to continue until the 1999 election.
* Schedule 7 lists the laws repealed by the new constitution, these being the interim constitution and the ten amendments made to it.
== Amendments ==

Section 74 of the Constitution provides that a bill to amend the Constitution can only be passed if at least two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly (that is, at least 267 of the 400 members) vote in favour of it. If the amendment affects provincial powers or boundaries, or if it amends the Bill of Rights, at least six of the nine provinces in the National Council of Provinces must also vote for it. To amend section 1 of the Constitution, which establishes the existence of South Africa as a sovereign, democratic state, and lays out the country&#x27;s founding values, would require the support of three-quarters of the members of the National Assembly. There have been eighteen amendments since 1996.

=== First Amendment ===

The Constitution First Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, 1997) was signed by the President on 28 August 1997 but had effect retroactively to 4 February 1997 when the constitution came into force. It had three provisions:
* to provide that a person who serves as Acting President of the Republic more than once during a single presidential term only has to swear the oath of office the first time that they become Acting President.
* to allow the President of the Constitutional Court to designate another judge to administer the oath of office to the President or Acting President, rather than administering it personally.
* to extend the cut-off date for actions for which amnesty could be granted by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, changing it from 6 December 1993 to 11 May 1994.

This last change allowed the TRC to deal with various violent events, particularly the Bophuthatswana &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and its aftermath, that had occurred in the run-up to the 1994 general elections.

=== Second Amendment ===

The Constitution Second Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, 1998) came into force on 7 October 1998. It had five provisions:
* to extend the term of office of municipal councils from four years to five years.
* to extend certain deadlines in the process of transition to the post-apartheid system of local government.
* to allow for the designation of alternates to replace members of the Judicial Service Commission.
* to give Parliament the ability to assign additional powers or functions to the Public Service Commission.
* to rename the Human Rights Commission to the South African Human Rights Commission.

=== Third Amendment ===

The Constitution Third Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, 1998) came into force on 30 October 1998. It allowed for municipalities to be established across provincial boundaries by the agreement of the national and the relevant provincial governments. The changes it made were reversed in 2005 by the Twelfth Amendment.

=== Fourth and Fifth Amendments ===

The Constitution Fourth Amendment Act and Constitution Fifth Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, 1999 and Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, 1999) came into force on 19 March 1999. They were passed as two separate amendments because the Fourth contained provisions affecting provincial government, which required the approval of the National Council of Provinces, while the Fifth did not.

The Fourth Amendment:
* clarified that elections to the provincial legislatures may be called either before or after the term of office of the previous legislature has expired.
* modified the formula for the allocation of delegates&#x27; seats to parties in the National Council of Provinces.

The Fifth Amendment:
* clarified that elections to the National Assembly may be called either before or after the term of office of the previous Assembly has expired.
* allowed the chairperson and deputy chairperson of the Financial and Fiscal Commission to be part-time members.

=== Sixth Amendment ===

The Constitution Sixth Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, 2001) came into force on 21 November 2001. Its main effect was to give the title of &quot;Chief Justice of South Africa&quot; to the presiding judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, who had previously been titled &quot;President of the Constitutional Court&quot;. The presiding judge of the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA), who had previously had the title of Chief Justice, became instead &quot;President of the Supreme Court of Appeal&quot;. The deputy heads of each court were also renamed similarly. Consequentially many provisions of the Constitution had to be amended where they made reference to the President of the Constitutional Court.

These changes were intended to clarify the structure of the South African judiciary. Previously, the President of the Constitutional Court was responsible for various constitutional responsibilities, such as calling the first session of Parliament after an election and presiding over the election of the President of the Republic at that session, while the Chief Justice was responsible for judicial administration, including for example chairing the Judicial Service Commission. These responsibilities were merged into a single post, reflecting the pre-eminence of the Constitutional Court at the apex of the court system.

Other provisions of the amendment:

* allowed the term of office of a Constitutional Court judgeusually twelve years or until the judge reaches the age of seventy, whichever is shorterto be extended by an Act of Parliament.
* allowed the President to appoint two Deputy Ministers from outside the National Assembly, where previously Deputy Ministers had to be members of the Assembly.
* allowed municipal councils to bind the authority of future successor councils, as security for a loan.

=== Seventh Amendment ===

The Constitution Seventh Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, 2001) came into force on 26 April 2002, except for provisions affecting the Financial and Fiscal Commission which came into force on 1 December 2003. It made various amendments to provisions affecting the financial management of national and provincial government, including:
* an extension of what is considered a &quot;money bill&quot; in the national Parliament and the provincial legislatures.
* requiring that Division of Revenue Bills (bills dividing revenue between national, provincial and local government) can only be introduced to Parliament by the Minister of Finance.
* reducing the size of the Financial and Fiscal Commission from 22 members to nine members, by reducing the number of members chosen by the president from nine to two, and by replacing the nine members chosen by the nine provinces individually with three members chosen by the provinces collectively.
* modifying the mechanisms whereby the national government can control the financial practices of the provincial governments.

=== Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments ===


These amendments allowed legislators to cross the floor, that is, to resign from their political party and join a different party (or form a new party) without losing their elected position. This was not originally allowed because South African elections are based on party-list proportional representation in which voters choose a political party rather than an individual candidate. Floor crossing therefore means that the composition of the elected bodies no longer represents the preferences of voters.

The Eighth and Ninth Amendments came into force on 20 June 2002, as did an ordinary act of Parliament called the Loss or Retention of Membership of National and Provincial Legislatures Act, 2002. The Eighth Amendment allowed members of municipal councils to cross the floor. The Loss or Retention of Membership Act was intended to allow members of the National Assembly and provincial legislatures to cross the floor. The Ninth Amendment made provision for the reallocation of seats in the National Council of Provinces when the party composition of a provincial legislature changed as a result of floor crossing.

However, on 4 October 2002, in the case of &quot;United Democratic Movement v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others&quot;, the Constitutional Court found the Loss or Retention of Membership Act to be unconstitutional, so floor crossing remained prohibited in the National Assembly and provincial legislatures. The Tenth Amendment was introduced to constitutionally allow floor crossing in the National Assembly and provincial legislatures; it came into force on 20 March 2003.

The changes made by these three amendments were reversed when floor crossing was ended in 2009 by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.

=== Eleventh Amendment ===

The Constitution Eleventh Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, 2003) came into force on 11 July 2003. It renamed the Northern Province to Limpopo, altered the procedure for intervention by the national government in a failing provincial government and intervention by a provincial government in a failing municipality, and expanded the powers of the provincial executive when it intervenes in a municipality.

=== Twelfth and Thirteenth Amendments ===

The Constitution Twelfth Amendment Act came into force on 1 March 2006; it altered the boundaries of seven of the provinces. In the interim constitution the provinces had been defined in terms of magisterial districts; the amendment redefined them in terms of the district and metropolitan municipalities. The Twelfth Amendment also removed the provisions introduced by the Third Amendment that allowed municipalities to be established across provincial boundaries.

Some of the boundary changes encountered substantial public opposition. The community of Matatiele, which had been transferred from KwaZulu-Natal to the Eastern Cape, challenged the amendment before the Constitutional Court, which ruled on 18 August 2006 that the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature had not allowed for the necessary public participation before approving the amendment. The court&#x27;s order was suspended for eighteen months, and during that time Parliament re-enacted the Matatiele boundary change as the Thirteenth Amendment, which came into force on 14 December 2007.

The people of Khutsong, which had been transferred from Gauteng to the North West, resorted to marches, protests (in some cases violent) and boycotts and stayaways. In 2009 the Merafong City Municipality, which contains Khutsong, was transferred back to Gauteng by the Sixteenth Amendment.

=== Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments ===
The Constitution Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment Acts came into force on 17 April 2009; they repealed the floor crossing provisions introduced by the Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments.

The Fourteenth Amendment contained the provisions which affected the provincial legislatures and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), and therefore had to be approved by supermajority in the NCOP as well as the National Assembly, while the Fifteenth Amendment contained the remaining provisions which only had to be approved by the Assembly.

=== Sixteenth Amendment ===

The Constitution Sixteenth Amendment Act came into force on 3 April 2009. It transferred the Merafong City Municipality from the North West province to Gauteng province. This followed community opposition and protest in Khutsong following from the boundary change introduced by the Twelfth Amendment.

=== Seventeenth Amendment ===

The Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act came into force on 23 August 2013; along with the Superior Courts Act it restructured the judicial system. The amendment:
* declared the Chief Justice to be the head of the judiciary, with responsibility for administrative oversight of the courts.
* expanded the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court so that, as well as constitutional matters, it has jurisdiction over any matters of general public importance that it chooses to hear.
* removed the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Appeal over appeals from the Labour Appeal Court and the Competition Appeal Court.
* altered references to the High Courts so that they are regarded as divisions of a single High Court of South Africa rather than separate courts.
* allowed the appointment of a Constitutional Court judge as acting Deputy Chief Justice (DCJ) if the position is vacant or the DCJ is absent.

=== Eighteenth Amendment ===

The Constitution Eighteenth Amendment Act, signed on 19 July 2023, made South African Sign Language an official language of South Africa, in addition to the existing eleven official spoken languages.

<text>Broadcast television systems (or terrestrial television systems outside the US and Canada) are the encoding or formatting systems for the transmission and reception of terrestrial television signals.

Analog television systems were standardized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 1961, with each system designated by a letter (A-N) in combination with the color standard used (NTSC, PAL or SECAM) - for example PAL-B, NTSC-M, etc.). These analog systems for TV broadcasting dominated until the 2000s.

With the introduction of digital terrestrial television (DTT), they were replaced by four main systems in use around the world: ATSC, DVB, ISDB and DTMB.

== Analog television systems ==

Every analog television system bar one began as a black-and-white system. Each country, faced with local political, technical, and economic issues, adopted a color television standard which was grafted onto an existing monochrome system such as CCIR System M, using gaps in the video spectrum (explained below) to allow color transmission information to fit in the existing channels allotted. The grafting of the color transmission standards onto existing monochrome systems permitted existing monochrome television receivers predating the changeover to color television to continue to be operated as monochrome television. Because of this compatibility requirement, color standards added a second signal to the basic monochrome signal, which carries the color information. The color information is called chrominance with the symbol C, while the black and white information is called the luminance with the symbol Y. Monochrome television receivers only display the luminance, while color receivers process both signals. Though in theory any monochrome system could be adopted to a color system, in practice some of the original monochrome systems proved impractical to adapt to color and were abandoned when the switch to color broadcasting was made. All countries used one of three color standards: NTSC, PAL, or SECAM. For example, CCIR System M was often used in conjunction with NTSC standard, to provide color analog television and the two together were known as NTSC-M.

=== Pre–World War II systems ===
A number of experimental and broadcast pre-WW2 systems were tested. The first ones were mechanically based and of very low resolution, sometimes with no sound. Later TV systems were electronic, and usually mentioned by their line number: 375-line (used in Germany, Italy, US), 405-line (used in the UK), 441-line (used in Germany, France, Italy, US) or 567-line (used in the Netherlands). These systems were mostly experimental and national, with no defined international standards, and didn&#x27;t resume broadcasting after the war. An exception was the UK 405-line system, that resumed broadcasts and was the first to be standardized by ITU as System A, remaining in operation until 1985.

=== ITU standards ===
On an international conference in Stockholm in 1961, the International Telecommunication Union designated standards for broadcast television systems (ITU System Letter Designation). Each standard is designated by a letter (A-M).

On VHF bands I, II and III the 405, 625 and 819-line systems could be used:

* A – 405-line system, 5 MHz video bandwidth
* B – 625-line system, 7 MHz video bandwidth
* C – Belgian 625-line system, 7 MHz video bandwidth
* D – I.B.T.O. 625-line system, 8 MHz video bandwidth
* E – French 819-line system, 14 MHz video bandwidth
* F – Belgian 819-line system, 7 MHz video bandwidth

On UHF bands Bands IV and V only 625-line systems were adopted, with the difference being transmission parameters like channel bandwidth.

* G – 625-line system, 5 MHz video bandwidth
* H – 625-line system, 5 MHz video bandwidth
* I – 625-line system, 5.5 MHz video bandwidth
* K – 625-line system, 6 MHz video bandwidth
* L – 625-line system, 6 MHz video bandwidth

Following further conferences and the introduction of color television, by 1966 each standard was designated by a letter (A-M) in combination with a color standard (NTSC, PAL, SECAM). This completely specifies all of the monaural analog television systems in the world (for example, PAL-B, NTSC-M, etc.).

The following table gives the principal characteristics of each standard. Except for lines and frame rates, other units are megahertz (MHz).

==== Notes by system ====
; A: Early United Kingdom and Ireland VHF system (B&amp;W only). First electronic TV system, introduced in 1936. Vestigial sideband filtering introduced in 1949. Discontinued on 23 November 1982 in Ireland and on 2 January 1985 in the UK.
; B: VHF-only in most Western European countries (combined with system G and H on UHF); VHF and UHF in Australia. Originally known as the Gerber standard.
; C: Early VHF system; used only in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, as a compromise between Systems B and L. Discontinued in 1977.
; D: The first 625-line system. Used on VHF only in most countries (combined with system K on UHF); VHF and UHF in China.
; E: Early French VHF system (B&amp;W only); very good (near HDTV) picture quality but uneconomical use of bandwidth. Sound carrier separation +11.15 MHz on odd numbered channels, -11.15 MHz on even numbered channels. Discontinued in 1984 (France) and 1985 (Monaco).
; F: Early VHF system used only in Belgium and Luxembourg; allowed French 819-line television programming to be broadcast on the 7 MHz VHF channels used in those countries, at a substantial cost in horizontal resolution. Discontinued in 1968 (Belgium) and 1971 (Luxembourg).
; G: UHF only; used in countries with System B on VHF, except Australia.
; H: UHF only; used only in Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands. Similar to System G with a 1.25 MHz vestigal sideband.
; I: Used in the UK, Ireland, Southern Africa, Macau, Hong Kong and Falkland Islands.
; J: Used in Japan (see system M below). Identical to system M except that a different black level of 0 IRE is used instead of 7.5 IRE. Although the ITU specified a frame rate of 30 fields, 29.97 was adopted with the introduction of NTSC color to minimize visual artifacts. Discontinued in 2012, when Japan transitioned to digital.
; K: UHF only; used in countries with system D on VHF, except China, and identical to it in most respects.
; K1: Used only in French overseas departments and territories.
; L: Used only in France. On VHF Band 1 only, the audio is at −6.5 MHz. Discontinued in 2011, when France transitioned to digital. It was the last system to use positive video modulation and AM sound.
; M: Used in most of the Americas and Caribbean (except Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and French Guiana), Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines (all NTSC-M), Brazil (PAL-M), Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos (SECAM-M). Although the ITU specified a frame rate of 30 fields, 29.97 was adopted with the introduction of NTSC color to minimize visual artifacts.
; N: Adopted by Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay (all PAL-N since 1980).

=== Evolution ===
For historical reasons, some countries use a different video system on UHF than they do on the VHF bands. In a few countries, most notably the United Kingdom, television broadcasting on VHF has been entirely shut down. The British 405-line system A, unlike all the other systems, suppressed the upper sideband rather than the lower—befitting its status as the oldest operating television system to survive into the color era (although was never officially broadcast with color encoding). System A was tested with all three color standards, and production equipment was designed and ready to be built; System A might have survived, as NTSC-A, had the British government not decided to harmonize with the rest of Europe on a 625-line video system, implemented in Britain as PAL-I on UHF only.

The French 819 line system E was a post-war effort to advance France&#x27;s standing in television technology. Its 819 lines were almost high definition even by today&#x27;s standards. Like the British system A, it was VHF only and remained black &amp; white until its shutdown in 1984 in France and 1985 in Monaco. It was tested with SECAM standard in the early stages, but later the decision was made to adopt color in 625-lines L system only. Thus, France adopted system L both on UHF and VHF networks and abandoned system E.

Japan had the earliest working HDTV system (MUSE), with design efforts going back to 1979. The country began broadcasting wideband analog high-definition video signals in the late 1980s using an interlaced resolution of 1,125 lines, supported by the Sony HDVS line of equipment.

In many parts of the world, analog television broadcasting has been shut down completely, or in process of shutdown; see Digital television transition for a timeline of the analog shutdown.

=== Technical aspects ===

==== Frames ====
Ignoring color, all television systems work in essentially the same manner. The monochrome image seen by a camera (later, the luminance component of a color image) is divided into horizontal &quot;scan lines&quot;, some number of which make up a single image or &quot;frame&quot;. A monochrome image is theoretically continuous, and thus unlimited in horizontal resolution, but to make television practical, a limit had to be placed on the bandwidth of the television signal, which puts an ultimate limit on the horizontal resolution possible. When color was introduced, this necessity of limit became fixed. All analog television systems are &quot;interlaced&quot;: alternate rows of the frame are transmitted in sequence, followed by the remaining rows in their sequence. Each half of the frame is called a &quot;video field&quot;, and the rate at which field are transmitted is one of the fundamental parameters of a video system. It is related to the utility frequency at which the electricity distribution system operates, to avoid flicker resulting from the beat between the television screen deflection system and nearby mains generated magnetic fields. All digital, or &quot;fixed pixel,&quot; displays have progressive scanning and must deinterlace an interlaced source. Use of inexpensive deinterlacing hardware is a typical difference between lower- vs. higher-priced flat panel displays (Plasma display, LCD, etc.).

All films and other filmed material shot at 24 frames per second must be transferred to video frame rates using a telecine in order to prevent severe motion jitter effects. Typically, for 25 frame/s formats (European among other countries with 50 Hz mains supply), the content is PAL speedup, while a technique known as &quot;3:2 pulldown&quot; is used for 30 frame/s formats (North America among other countries with 60 Hz mains supply) to match the film frame rate to the video frame rate without speeding up the play back.

==== Viewing technology ====
Analog television signal standards are designed to be displayed on a cathode ray tube (CRT), and so the physics of these devices necessarily controls the format of the video signal. The image on a CRT is painted by a moving beam of electrons which hits a phosphor coating on the front of the tube. This electron beam is steered by a magnetic field generated by powerful electromagnets close to the source of the electron beam.

In order to reorient this magnetic steering mechanism, a certain amount of time is required due to the inductance of the magnets; the greater the change, the greater the time it takes for the electron beam to settle in the new spot.

For this reason, it is necessary to shut off the electron beam (corresponding to a video signal of zero luminance) during the time it takes to reorient the beam from the end of one line to the beginning of the next (&quot;horizontal retrace&quot;) and from the bottom of the screen to the top (&quot;vertical retrace&quot; or &quot;vertical blanking interval&quot;). The horizontal retrace is accounted for in the time allotted to each scan line, but the vertical retrace is accounted for as &quot;phantom lines&quot; which are never displayed but which are included in the number of lines per frame defined for each video system. Since the electron beam must be turned off in any case, the result is gaps in the television signal, which can be used to transmit other information, such as test signals or color identification signals.

The temporal gaps translate into a comb-like frequency spectrum for the signal, where the teeth are spaced at line frequency and concentrate most of the energy; the space between the teeth can be used to insert a color subcarrier.

==== Hidden signaling ====
Broadcasters later developed mechanisms to transmit digital information on the phantom lines, used mostly for teletext and closed captioning:

* PALplus uses a hidden signaling scheme to indicate if it exists, and if so what operational mode it is in.
* NTSC was modified by the Advanced Television Systems Committee to support an anti-ghosting signal that is inserted on a non-visible scan line.
* Teletext uses hidden signaling to transmit information pages.
* NTSC Closed Captioning signaling uses signaling that is nearly identical to teletext signaling.
* Widescreen signaling enables a flag to indicate that a 16:9 widescreen image is being broadcast, and allows the TV set to switch to the appropriate display mode.

==== Overscan ====
Television images are unique in that they must incorporate regions of the picture with reasonable-quality content, that will never be seen by some viewers.

==== Interlacing ====
In a purely analog system, field order is merely a matter of convention. For digitally recorded material it becomes necessary to rearrange the field order when conversion takes place from one standard to another.

==== Image signal polarization ====
Another parameter of analog television systems, minor by comparison, is the choice of whether vision modulation is positive or negative. Some of the earliest electronic television systems such as the British 405-line (System A) used positive modulation. It was also used in the two Belgian systems (System C, 625 lines, and System F, 819 lines) and the two French systems (System E, 819 lines, and System L, 625 lines). In positive modulation systems, as in the earlier white facsimile transmission standard, the maximum luminance value is represented by the maximum carrier power; in negative modulation, the maximum luminance value is represented by zero carrier power. All newer analog video systems use negative modulation with the exception of the French System L.

Impulsive noise, especially from older automotive ignition systems, caused white spots to appear on the screens of television receivers using positive modulation but they could use simple synchronization circuits. Impulsive noise in negative modulation systems appears as dark spots that are less visible, but picture synchronization was seriously degraded when using simple synchronization. The synchronization problem was overcome with the invention of phase-locked synchronization circuits. When these first appeared in Britain in the early 1950s one name used to describe them was &quot;flywheel synchronisation.&quot;

Older televisions for positive modulation systems were sometimes equipped with a peak video signal inverter that would turn the white interference spots dark. This was usually user-adjustable with a control on the rear of the television labeled &quot;White Spot Limiter&quot; in Britain or &quot;Antiparasite&quot; in France. If adjusted incorrectly it would turn bright white picture content dark. Most of the positive modulation television systems ceased operation by the mid-1980s. The French System L continued on up to the transition to digital broadcasting. Positive modulation was one of several unique technical features that originally protected the French electronics and broadcasting industry from foreign competition and rendered French TV sets incapable of receiving broadcasts from neighboring countries.

Another advantage of negative modulation is that, since the synchronizing pulses represent maximum carrier power, it is relatively easy to arrange the receiver automatic gain control to only operate during sync pulses and thus get a constant amplitude video signal to drive the rest of the TV set. This was not possible for many years with positive modulation as the peak carrier power varied depending on picture content. Modern digital processing circuits have achieved a similar effect but using the front porch of the video signal.

==== Modulation ====
Given all of these parameters, the result is a mostly-continuous analog signal which can be modulated onto a radio-frequency carrier and transmitted through an antenna. All analog television systems use vestigial sideband modulation, a form of amplitude modulation in which one sideband is partially removed. This reduces the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, enabling narrower channels to be used.

==== Audio ====
In analog television, the analog audio portion of a broadcast is invariably modulated separately from the video. Most commonly, the audio and video are combined at the transmitter before being presented to the antenna, but separate aural and visual antennas can be used. In all cases where negative video is used, FM is used for the standard monaural audio; systems with positive video use AM sound and intercarrier receiver technology cannot be incorporated. Stereo, or more generally multi-channel, audio is encoded using a number of schemes which (except in the French systems) are independent of the video system. The principal systems are NICAM, which uses a digital audio encoding; double-FM (known under a variety of names, notably Zweikanalton, A2 Stereo, West German Stereo, German Stereo or IGR Stereo), in which case each audio channel is separately modulated in FM and added to the broadcast signal; and BTSC (also known as MTS), which multiplexes additional audio channels into the FM audio carrier. All three systems are compatible with monaural FM audio, but only NICAM may be used with the French AM audio systems.

== Digital television systems ==
The situation with worldwide digital television is much simpler by comparison. Most digital television systems are based on the MPEG transport stream standard, and use the H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 video codec. They differ significantly in the details of how the transport stream is converted into a broadcast signal, in the video format prior to encoding (or alternatively, after decoding), and in the audio format. This has not prevented the creation of an international standard that includes both major systems, even though they are incompatible in almost every respect.

The two principal digital broadcasting systems are ATSC standards, developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee and adopted as a standard in most of North America, and DVB-T, the Digital Video Broadcast – Terrestrial system used in most of the rest of the world. DVB-T was designed for format compatibility with existing direct broadcast satellite services in Europe (which use the DVB-S standard, and also sees some use in direct-to-home satellite dish providers in North America), and there is also a DVB-C version for cable television. While the ATSC standard also includes support for satellite and cable television systems, operators of those systems have chosen other technologies (principally DVB-S or proprietary systems for satellite and 256QAM replacing VSB for cable). Japan uses a third system, closely related to DVB-T, called ISDB-T, which is compatible with Brazil&#x27;s SBTVD. The People&#x27;s Republic of China has developed a fourth system, named DMB-T/H.

=== ATSC ===
The terrestrial ATSC system (unofficially ATSC-T) uses a proprietary Zenith-developed modulation called 8-VSB; as the name implies, it is a vestigial sideband technique. Essentially, analog VSB is to regular amplitude modulation as 8VSB is to eight-way quadrature amplitude modulation. This system was chosen specifically to provide for maximum spectral compatibility between existing analog TV and new digital stations in the United States&#x27; already-crowded television allocations system, although it is inferior to the other digital systems in dealing with multipath interference; however, it is better at dealing with impulse noise which is especially present on the VHF bands that other countries have discontinued from TV use, but are still used in the U.S. There is also no hierarchical modulation. After demodulation and error-correction, the 8-VSB modulation supports a digital data stream of about 19.39 Mbit/s, enough for one high-definition video stream or several standard-definition services. See Digital subchannel: Technical considerations for more information.

On November 17, 2017, the FCC voted 3-2 in favor of authorizing voluntary deployments of ATSC 3.0, which was designed as the successor to the original ATSC &quot;1.0&quot;, and issued a Report and Order to that effect. Full-power stations will be required to maintain a simulcast of their channels on an ATSC 1.0-compatible signal if they decide to deploy an ATSC 3.0 service.

On cable, ATSC usually uses 256QAM, although some use 16VSB. Both of these double the throughput to 38.78 Mbit/s within the same 6 MHz bandwidth. ATSC is also used over satellite. While these are logically called ATSC-C and ATSC-S, these terms were never officially defined.

=== DTMB ===
DTMB is the digital television broadcasting standard of the Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. This is a fusion system, which is a compromise of different competing proposing standards from different Chinese Universities, which incorporates elements from DMB-T, ADTB-T and TiMi 3.

=== DVB ===
DVB-T uses coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (COFDM), which uses as many as 8000 independent carriers, each transmitting data at a comparatively low rate. This system was designed to provide superior immunity from multipath interference, and has a choice of system variants which allow data rates from 4 MBit/s up to 24 MBit/s. One US broadcaster, Sinclair Broadcasting, petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to permit the use of COFDM instead of 8-VSB, on the theory that this would improve prospects for digital TV reception by households without outside antennas (a majority in the US), but this request was denied. (However, one US digital station, WNYE-DT in New York, was temporarily converted to COFDM modulation on an emergency basis for datacasting information to emergency services personnel in lower Manhattan in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks).

DVB-S is the original Digital Video Broadcasting forward error coding and modulation standard for satellite television and dates back to 1995. It is used via satellites serving every continent of the world, including North America. DVB-S is used in both MCPC and SCPC modes for broadcast network feeds, as well as for direct broadcast satellite services like Sky and Freesat in the British Isles, Sky Deutschland and HD+ in Germany and Austria, TNT Sat/Fransat and CanalSat in France, Dish Network in the US, and Bell Satellite TV in Canada. The MPEG transport stream delivered by DVB-S is mandated as MPEG-2.

DVB-C stands for Digital Video Broadcasting - Cable and it is the DVB European consortium standard for the broadcast transmission of digital television over cable. This system transmits an MPEG-2 family digital audio/video stream, using a QAM modulation with channel coding.

=== ISDB ===
ISDB is very similar to DVB, however it is broken into 13 subchannels. Twelve are used for TV, while the last serves either as a guard band, or for the 1seg (ISDB-H) service. Like the other DTV systems, the ISDB types differ mainly in the modulations used, due to the requirements of different frequency bands. The 12 GHz band ISDB-S uses PSK modulation, 2.6 GHz band digital sound broadcasting uses CDM and ISDB-T (in VHF and/or UHF band) uses COFDM with PSK/QAM. It was developed in Japan with MPEG-2, and is now used in Brazil with MPEG-4. Unlike other digital broadcast systems, ISDB includes digital rights management to restrict recording of programming.

=== Comparison of digital terrestrial television systems ===
== Line count ==
As interlaced systems require accurate positioning of scanning lines, it is important to make sure that the horizontal and vertical timebase are in a precise ratio. This is accomplished by passing the one through a series of electronic divider circuits to produce the other. Each division is by a prime number.

Therefore, there has to be a straightforward mathematical relationship between the line and field frequencies, the latter being derived by dividing down from the former. Technology constraints of the 1930s meant that this division process could only be done using small integers, preferably no greater than 7, for good stability. The number of lines was odd because of 2:1 interlace. The 405 line system used a vertical frequency of 50 Hz (Standard AC mains supply frequency in Britain) and a horizontal one of 10,125 Hz (50 × 405 ÷ 2)
* 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 gives 90 lines (non interlaced)
* 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 gives 96 lines (non interlaced)
* 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 gives 180 lines (non interlaced) (used in Germany in mid-1930s before switch to 441-line system)
* 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 gives 240 lines (used for the experimental Baird transmissions in Britain )
* 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 gives 243 lines
* 7 × 7 × 7 gives 343 lines (early North American system also used in Poland and in Soviet Union before WW2)
* 3 × 5 × 5 × 5 gives 375 lines
* 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 gives 405 lines System A (used in Britain, Ireland and Hong Kong before 1985)
* 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 11 gives 440 lines (non interlaced)
* 3 × 3 × 7 × 7 gives 441 lines (used by RCA in North America before the 525-lines NTSC standard was adopted and widely used before WW2 in Continental Europe with different frame rates)
* 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 gives 450 lines (non interlaced)
* 5 × 7 × 13 gives 455 lines (used in France before WW2)
* 3 × 5 × 5 × 7 gives 525 lines System M (480i) (a compromise between the RCA and Philco systems. Still used today in most of the Americas and parts of Asia)
* 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 7 gives 567 lines (Developed by Philips used for a while in the late 1940s in the Netherlands)
* 5 × 11 × 11 gives 605 lines (proposed by Philco in North America before the 525 standard was adopted)
* 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 gives 625 lines (576i) (designed by Soviet engineers during the mid-late 1940s, introduced to Western Europe by German engineers.)
* 2 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5 gives 750 lines at 50 frames (used for 720p50)
* 2 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5 gives 750 lines at 60 frames (used for 720p60)
* 3 × 3 × 7 × 13 gives 819 lines (737i) (used in France in the 1950s)
* 3 × 7 × 7 × 7 gives 1,029 lines (proposed but never adopted around 1948 in France)
* 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 x 5 gives 1,125 lines at 25 frames (used for 1080i50 but not 1080p25)
* 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 x 5 gives 1,125 lines at 30 frames (used for 1080i60 but not 1080p30)

;Notes

# The division of the 240-line system is academic as the scan ratio was determined entirely by the construction of the mechanical scanning system used with the cameras used with this transmission system.
# The division ratio though relevant to CRT-based systems is largely academic today because modern LCD and plasma displays are not constrained to having the scanning in precise ratios. The 1080p high definition system requires 1125 lines in a CRT display.
# The System I version of the 625-line standard originally used 582 active lines before later changing to 576 in line with other 625-line systems.

== Conversion from one system to another system ==

Converting between different numbers of lines and different frequencies of fields/frames in video pictures is not an easy task. Perhaps the most technically challenging conversion to make is from any of the 625-line, 25-frame/s systems to system M, which has 525-lines at 29.97 frames per second. Historically this required a frame store to hold those parts of the picture not actually being output (since the scanning of any point was not time coincident). In more recent times, conversion of standards is a relatively easy task for a computer.

Aside from the line count being different, it&#x27;s easy to see that generating 59.94 fields every second from a format that has only 50 fields might pose some interesting problems. Every second, an additional 10 fields must be generated seemingly from nothing. The conversion has to create new frames (from the existing input) in real time.

There are several methods used to do this, depending on the desired cost and conversion quality. The simplest possible converters simply drop every 5th line from every frame (when converting from 625 to 525) or duplicate every 4th line (when converting from 525 to 625), and then duplicate or drop some of those frames to make up the difference in frame rate. More complex systems include inter-field interpolation, adaptive interpolation, and phase correlation.
