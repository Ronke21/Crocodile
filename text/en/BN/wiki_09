<text>Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one&#x27;s hands with soap or handwash and water to remove viruses/bacteria/microorganisms, dirt, grease, and other harmful or unwanted substances stuck to the hands. Drying of the washed hands is part of the process as wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated. If soap and water are unavailable, hand sanitizer that is at least 60% (v/v) alcohol in water can be used as long as hands are not visibly excessively dirty or greasy. Hand hygiene is central to preventing the spread of infectious diseases in home and everyday life settings.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends washing hands for at least 20 seconds before and after certain activities. These include the five critical times during the day where washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease: after using the toilet (for urination, defecation, menstrual hygiene), after cleaning a child&#x27;s bottom (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.

When neither hand washing nor using hand sanitizer is possible, hands can be cleaned with uncontaminated ash and clean water, although the benefits and harms are uncertain for reducing the spread of viral or bacterial infections. However, frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin. Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep the hands from drying out; dry skin can lead to skin damage which can increase the risk for the transmission of infection.

== Steps and duration ==
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the following steps when washing one&#x27;s hands for the prevention of transmission of disease:
# Wet hands with warm or cold running water. Running water is recommended because standing basins may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference, however some experts suggest warm, tepid water may be superior.
# Lather hands by rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of hands, between fingers, and under nails. Soap lifts pathogens from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when soap is used rather than water alone.
# Scrub for &quot;at least 20 seconds&quot;. Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove pathogens from skin, and scrubbing for longer periods removes more pathogens.
# Rinse well under running water. Rinsing in a basin can recontaminate hands.
# Dry with a clean towel or allow to air dry. Wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated.
The most commonly missed areas are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under fingernails. Artificial nails and chipped nail polish may harbor microorganisms.

===When it is recommended===
There are five critical times during the day where washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease: after using the toilet (for urination, defecation, menstrual hygiene), after cleaning a child&#x27;s bottom (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry. Other occasions when correct handwashing technique should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.

== Public health ==
===Health benefits===

Hand washing has many significant health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, COVID-19, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
and reducing infant mortality rate at home birth deliveries. A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices may lead to small improvements in the length growth in children under five years of age. In developing countries, childhood mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap. This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50%. Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low income areas. 48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap.

Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities worldwide. Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year. Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million child deaths annually. According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-quarter. Hand washing is usually integrated with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programmes. Hand washing also protects against impetigo which is transmitted through direct physical contact.

===Adverse effects===
A small detrimental effect of handwashing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to the drying of the skin. A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, flaky skin condition known as contact dermatitis, which is especially common among health-care workers.

===Behavior change===
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap. A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap.

A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%; the United States near the middle with 77%; and China with the lowest rate of 23%.

Several behavior change methodologies now exist to increase uptake of the behavior of hand washing with soap at the critical times.

Group hand washing for school children at set times of the day is one option in developing countries to engrain hand washing in children&#x27;s behaviors. The &quot;Essential Health Care Program&quot; implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of at scale action to promote children&#x27;s health and education. Deworming twice a year, supplemented with washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is at the core of this national program. It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.

== Substances used ==

===Soap and detergents===
Removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or detergents to water. Soap and detergents are surfactants that kill microorganisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins. It also emulsifies oils, enabling them to be carried away by running water.

====Solid soap====
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may hold bacteria acquired from previous uses. A small number of studies which have looked at the bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap have concluded transfer is unlikely as the bacteria are rinsed off with the foam. The CDC still states &quot;liquid soap with hands-free controls for dispensing is preferable&quot;.

====Antibacterial soap====
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public. To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature. However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms. So, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not selected for by antibacterial soaps, they might not be as effective as they are marketed to be. Besides the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, the sophisticated formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).

A 2007 meta-analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that plain soaps are as effective as consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands. Dissenting, a 2011 meta-analysis in the &quot;Journal of Food Protection&quot; argued that when properly formulated, triclosan can grant a small but detectable improvement, as can chlorhexidine gluconate, iodophor, or povidone.

===Warm water===
Hot water that is still comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria. Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C). WHO considers warm soapy water to be more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural oils which hold soils and bacteria. But CDC mentions that warm water causes skin irritations more often and its ecological footprint is more significant. Water temperatures from 4 to 40 °C do not differ significantly regarding removal of microbes. The most important factor is proper scrubbing.

Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on hands. Using hot water for handwashing can even be regarded as a waste of energy.

===Antiseptics (hand sanitizer)===
In situations where hand washing with soap is not an option (e.g., when in a public place with no access to wash facilities), a waterless hand sanitizer such as an alcohol hand gel can be used. They can be used in addition to hand washing to minimize risks when caring for &quot;at-risk&quot; groups. To be effective, alcohol hand gels should contain not less than 60%v/v alcohol. Enough hand antiseptic or alcohol rub must be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands. The front and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers must be rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry. Finger tips must be washed well too, rubbing them in both palms.

A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent. In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity. Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol. Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases further the antimicrobial activity.

Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend hand washing with soap over hand sanitizer rubs, particularly when hands are visibly dirty. The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however, they should not serve as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable. Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not cleanse the hands of organic material, but simply disinfect them. It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens remain on the hands.

=== Wipes ===
Hand washing using hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative during traveling in the absence of soap and water. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.

===Ash or mud===
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead. The World Health Organization recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available. Use of ash is common in rural areas of developing countries and has in experiments been shown at least as effective as soap for removing pathogens. However, evidence to support the use of ash to wash hands is of poor quality. It is not clear if washing hands with ash is effective at reducing viral or bacterial spreading compared to washing with mud, not washing, or with washing with water alone. One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it, however, there is also no clear evidence to determine the level of risk. Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent because in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.

== Technologies and design aspects ==

===Low-cost options when water is scarce===
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where tap-water and/or soap is not available e.g. pouring water from a hanging jerrycan or gourd with suitable holes and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.

In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-conserving solutions, such as &quot;tippy-taps&quot; and other low-cost options. A tippy-tap is a simple technology using a jug suspended by a rope, and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar of soap.

Low-cost hand washing technologies for households may differ from facilities for multiple users. For households, options include tippy taps, bucket/container with tap (such as a Veronica Bucket), conventional tap with/without basin, valve/tap fitted to bottles, bucket and cup, camp sink. Options for multiple users include: adapting household technologies for multiple users, water container fitted to a pipe with multiple taps, water container fitted to a pipe with holes.

===Advanced technologies===
Several companies around the globe have developed technologies that aim to improve the hand washing process. Among the different inventions, there are eco-friendly devices that use 90% less
water and 60% less soap compared to hand washing under a faucet. Another device uses
light-based rays to detect contaminants on the hands after they have been washed.

Certain environments are especially sensitive to the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms, like health care and food production. Organizations attempting to prevent infection transmission in these environments have started using programmed washing cycles that provide sufficient time for scrubbing the hands with soap and rinsing them with water. Combined with AI-powered software, these technological advancements turn the hand-washing process into digital data, allowing individuals to receive insights and improve their hand hygiene practices.
===Drying with towels or hand driers===

Effective drying of the hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process. Therefore, the proper drying of hands after washing should be an integral part of the hand hygiene process in health care.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are clear and straightforward concerning hand hygiene, and recommend paper towels and hand dryers equally. Both have stressed the importance of frequent and thorough hand washing followed by their complete drying as a means to stop the spread of pathogens, like COVID-19. Specifically, the World Health Organization recommends that everyone &quot;frequently clean [their] hands...&quot; and &quot;dry [them] thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.&quot; The CDC report that, &quot;Both [clean towels or air hand dryers] are effective ways to dry hands.&quot;

A study in 2020 found that hand dryers and paper towels were both found to be equally hygienic hand-drying solutions.

However, there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in public toilets. A growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many public toilets. A review in 2012 concluded that &quot;From a hygiene standpoint, paper towels are superior to air dryers; therefore, paper towels should be recommended for use in locations in which hygiene is paramount, such as hospitals and clinics.&quot;

Jet-air dryers were found to be capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other users and the environment up to away. In the same study in 2008 (sponsored by the paper-towel industry the European Tissue Symposium), use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms only up to from the dryer, and paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms. No studies have found a correlation to hand dryers and human health, however, making these findings inconsequential.

=== Accessibility ===

Making hand washing facilities accessible (inclusive) to everyone is crucial to maintain hand washing behavior. Considerations for accessibility include age, disability, seasonality (with rains and muddiness), location and more. Important aspects for good accessibility include: Placement of the technology, paths, ramps, steps, type of tap, soap placement.

==Medical use==
Medical hand-washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital environment. There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget. One study has found decreased infection rates with their use.

===Method===
Medical hand-washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands. Hands should be rubbed together with digits interlocking. If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it. Since pathogens may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.

The purpose of hand-washing in the health-care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (&quot;germs&quot;) and avoid transmitting them. The &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; reports that a lack of hand-washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms. One study showed that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%.

The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in health-care sectors. The draft guidance of hand hygiene by the organization can also be found at its website for public comment. A relevant review was conducted by Whitby &quot;et al.&quot; Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.

The World Health Organization has &quot;Five Moments&quot; for washing hands:
* before patient care
* after environmental contact
* after exposure to blood/body fluids
* before an aseptic task, and
* after patient care.
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (&quot;medicated&quot; or &quot;antimicrobial&quot; soaps) confers killing action to a hand-washing agent. Such killing action may be desired before performing surgery or in settings in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent.

To &#x27;scrub&#x27; one&#x27;s hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels for drying the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for scrubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails. All jewelry should be removed. This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes. Long scrub-times (10 minutes) are not necessary. When rinsing, water on the forearms must be prevented from running back to the hands. After hand-washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is donned.

===Effectiveness in healthcare settings===
To reduce the spread of pathogens, it is better to wash the hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after tending to a sick person.

For control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand-cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and that very little additional benefit was gained when hand cleansing frequency was increased beyond 35%. Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap.

Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap. But soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridioides difficile spores from hands.

Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings can involve education for staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rub, and written and verbal reminders to staff. There is a need for more research into which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.

==Developing countries==
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition. However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people&#x27;s homes, at schools and the workplace make it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviors. For example, in most of rural Africa hand washing taps close to every private or public toilet are scarce, even though cheap options exist to build hand washing stations. However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of engrained habits rather than due to a lack of soap or water.

Hand washing at a global level has its own indicator within Sustainable Development Goal 6, Target 6.2 which states &quot;By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. The corresponding Indicator 6.2.1 is formulated as follows: &quot;Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water&quot; (see map to the right with data worldwide from 2017).&quot;

===Promotion campaigns===
The promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavior change of the population. For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary. A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.

One example for hand washing promotion in schools is the &quot;Three Star Approach&quot; by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements. When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to ultimately three stars. Building hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.

Global Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to achieve behavior change.

As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of a hand washing emoji.

Designing hand washing facilities that encourage use can use the following aspects:
* Nudges, cues and reminders
* Hand washing facilities should be placed at convenient locations to encourage people to use them regularly and at the right times; they should be attractive and well maintained.

===Cost effectiveness===
Few studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relationship to DALYs averted. However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.

==History==

The importance of hand washing for human healthparticularly for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitalswas first recognized in the mid 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the English &quot;founder of modern nursing&quot;. At that time most people still believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasmas.

In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection. The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases. For example, posters with &quot;correct hand washing techniques&quot; were hung up next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany. Research indicates that the COVID pandemic shifted social norms regarding hand washing, making it more prevalent worldwide.

==Society and culture==

===Moral aspects===
The phrase &quot;washing one&#x27;s hands of&quot; something, means declaring one&#x27;s unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or share complicity in it. It originates from the bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase with a much wider usage in some English communities.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imagined stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding crimes she had committed and induced her husband to commit.

<doc id="428503" wikidata="Q318105" url="?curid=428503" title="Corneliu Zelea Codreanu">
<text>Corneliu Zelea Codreanu (; 13 September 1899 – 30 November 1938), born Corneliu Zelinski and commonly known as Corneliu Codreanu, was a far-right Romanian politician, the founder and charismatic leader of the Iron Guard or &quot;The Legion of the Archangel Michael&quot; (also known as the &quot;Legionary Movement&quot;), an ultranationalist and violently antisemitic organization active throughout most of the interwar period. Generally seen as the main variety of local fascism, and noted for its mystical and Romanian Orthodox-inspired revolutionary message, the Iron Guard gained prominence on the Romanian political stage, coming into conflict with the political establishment and the democratic forces, and often resorting to terrorism. The Legionnaires traditionally referred to Codreanu as &quot;Căpitanul&quot; (&quot;The Captain&quot;), and he held absolute authority over the organization until his death.

Codreanu, who began his career in the wake of World War I as an anticommunist and antisemitic agitator associated with A. C. Cuza and Constantin Pancu, was a co-founder of the National-Christian Defense League and assassin of the Iași Police prefect Constantin Manciu. Codreanu left Cuza to found a succession of movements on the far right, rallying around him a growing segment of the country&#x27;s intelligentsia and peasant population, and inciting pogroms in various parts of Greater Romania. Several times outlawed by successive Romanian cabinets, his Legion assumed different names and survived in the underground, during which time Codreanu formally delegated leadership to Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul. Following Codreanu&#x27;s instructions, the Legion carried out assassinations of politicians it viewed as corrupt, including Premier Ion G. Duca and his former associate Mihai Stelescu. Simultaneously, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu advocated Romania&#x27;s adherence to a military and political alliance with Nazi Germany.

During the 1937 election, his party registered its strongest showing, placing third and winning 15.8% of the vote. It was blocked out of power by King Carol II, who invited the rival fascists and fourth-place finishers of the National Christian Party to form a short-lived government, succeeded by the National Renaissance Front royal dictatorship. The rivalry between Codreanu and, on the other side, Carol and moderate politicians like Nicolae Iorga ended with Codreanu&#x27;s incarceration at Jilava Prison and eventual assassination at the hands of the Gendarmerie. He was succeeded as leader by Horia Sima. In 1940, under the National Legionary State proclaimed by the Iron Guard, his killing served as the basis for violent retribution.

Corneliu Zelea Codreanu&#x27;s views influenced the modern far right. Groups claiming him as a forerunner include Noua Dreaptă and other Romanian successors of the Iron Guard, the International Third Position, and various neofascist organizations in Italy and other parts of Europe.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Corneliu Codreanu was born in Huși to Ion Zelea Codreanu and Elizabeth (née Brunner) on 13 September 1899. His father, a teacher and himself a Romanian nationalist, would later become a political figure within his son&#x27;s movement. A native of Bukovina in Austria-Hungary, Ion had originally been known as &quot;Zelinski&quot;; his wife was ethnically German. Statements according to which Ion Zelea Codreanu was originally a Slav of Ukrainian or Polish origin contrast with the Romanian chauvinism he embraced for the rest of his life; Codreanu the elder associated with antisemitic figures such as University of Iași professor A. C. Cuza. Just prior to Corneliu Zelea Codreanu&#x27;s 1938 trial, his ethnic origins were the subject of an anti-Legionary propagandistic campaign organized by the authorities, who distributed copies of a variant of his genealogy which alleged that he was of mixed ancestry, being the descendant of not just Ukrainians, Germans, and Romanians, but also Czechs and Russians, and that several of their ancestors were delinquents. Historian Ilarion Țiu describes this as an attempt to offend and libel Codreanu. Codreanu&#x27;s mother came from a Bukovina German family, which had originally emigrated from Bavaria.

Too young for conscription in 1916, when Romania entered World War I on the Entente side, Codreanu nonetheless tried his best to enlist and fight in the subsequent campaign. His education at the military school in Bacău (where he was a colleague of Petre Pandrea, the future left-wing activist) ended in the same year as Romania&#x27;s direct implication in the war. In 1919, after moving to Iași, Codreanu found communism as his new enemy, after he had witnessed the impact of Bolshevik agitation in Moldavia, and especially after Romania lost her main ally in the October Revolution, forcing her to sign the 1918 Treaty of Bucharest; also, the newly founded Comintern was violently opposed to Romania&#x27;s interwar borders (&quot;see Greater Romania&quot;).

While the Bolshevik presence decreased overall following the repression of Socialist Party riots in Bucharest (December 1918), it remained or was perceived as relatively strong in Iași and other Moldavian cities and towns. In this context, the easternmost region of Bessarabia, which united with Romania in 1918, was believed by Codreanu and others to be especially prone to Bolshevik influence. Codreanu learned antisemitism from his father, but connected it with anticommunism, in the belief that Jews were, among other things, the primordial agents of the Soviet Union (&quot;see Jewish Bolshevism&quot;).

=== GCN and National-Christian Defense League ===
Codreanu studied law in Iași, where he began his political career. Like his father, he became close to A. C. Cuza. Codreanu&#x27;s fear of Bolshevik insurrection led to his efforts to address industrial workers himself. At the time, Cuza was preaching that the Jewish population was a manifest threat to Romanians, claimed that Jews were threatening the purity of Romanian young women, and began campaigning in favour of racial segregation.

Historian Adrian Cioroianu defined the early Codreanu as a &quot;quasi-demagogue agitator&quot;. According to Cioroianu, Codreanu loved Romania with &quot;fanaticism&quot;, which implied that he saw the country as &quot;idyllicized [and] different from the real one of his times&quot;. British scholar Christopher Catherwood also referred to Codreanu as &quot;an obsessive anti-Semite and religious fanatic&quot;. Historian Zeev Barbu proposed that &quot;Cuza was Codreanu&#x27;s mentor [...], but nothing that Codreanu learned from him was strikingly new. Cuza served mainly as a catalyst for his nationalism and antisemitism.&quot; As he himself later acknowledged, the young activist was also deeply influenced by the physiologist and antisemitic ideologue Nicolae Paulescu, who was involved with Cuza&#x27;s movement.

In late 1919, Codreanu joined the short-lived Garda Conștiinței Naționale (GCN, &quot;Guard of National Conscience&quot;), a group formed by the electrician Constantin Pancu. Pancu had an enormous influence on Codreanu.

Pancu&#x27;s movement, whose original membership did not exceed 40, attempted to revive loyalism within the proletariat (while offering an alternative to communism by advocating increased labor rights). As much as other reactionary groups, it won the tacit support of General Alexandru Averescu and his increasingly popular People&#x27;s Party (of which Cuza became an affiliate); Averescu&#x27;s ascension to power in 1920 engendered a new period of social troubles in the larger urban areas (&quot;see Labor movement in Romania&quot;).

The GCN, in which Codreanu thought he could see the nucleus of nationalist trade unions, became active in crushing strike actions. Their activities did not fail in attracting attention, especially after students who obeyed Codreanu, grouped in the Association of Christian Students, started demanding a Jewish quota for higher education – this gathered popularity for the GCN, and it led to a drastic increase in the frequency and intensity of assaults on all its opponents. In response, Codreanu was expelled from the University of Iași. Although allowed to return when Cuza and others intervened for him (refusing to respect the decision of the University Senate), he was never presented with a diploma after his graduation.

While studying in Berlin and Jena in 1922, Codreanu took a critical attitude towards the Weimar Republic, and began praising the March on Rome and Italian fascism as major achievements against the advancement of communism; he decided to cut his stay short after learning of the large Romanian student protests in December, prompted by the intention of the government to grant the complete emancipation of Jews (&quot;see History of the Jews in Romania&quot;).

When protests organized by Codreanu were met with lack of interest from the new National Liberal government, he and Cuza founded (4 March 1923) a Christian nationalist organization called the National-Christian Defense League. They were joined in 1925 by Ion Moța, translator of the antisemitic hoax known as &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; and future ideologue of the Legion. Codreanu was subsequently tasked with organizing the League at a national level, and became especially preoccupied with its youth ventures.

With the granting of full rights of citizenship to persons of Jewish descent under the Constitution of 1923, the League raided the Iași ghetto, led a group which petitioned the government in Bucharest (being received with indifference), and ultimately decided to assassinate Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu and other members of government. Codreanu also drafted the first of his several death lists, which contained the names of politicians who, he believed, had betrayed Romania. It included Gheorghe Gh. Mârzescu, who held several offices in Brătianu&#x27;s executive, and who promoted the emancipation of Jews. In October 1923, Codreanu was betrayed by one of his associates, arrested, and put on trial. He and the other plotters were soon acquitted, as Romanian legislation did not allow for prosecution of conspiracies that had not been assigned a definite date. Before the jury ended deliberation, Ion Moța shot the traitor and was given a prison sentence himself.

=== Manciu&#x27;s killing ===
Codreanu clashed with Cuza over the League&#x27;s structure: he demanded that it develop a paramilitary and revolutionary character, while Cuza was hostile to the idea. In November, while in Văcărești Prison in Bucharest, Codreanu had planned for the creation of a youth organization within the League, which he aimed to call &quot;The Legion of the Archangel Michael&quot;. This was said to be in honour of an Orthodox icon that adorned the walls of the prison church, or, more specifically, linked to Codreanu&#x27;s reported claim of having been visited by the Archangel himself. A more personal problem also divided Codreanu and Cuza, namely that Cuza&#x27;s son had an affair with Codreanu&#x27;s sister that left her pregnant. The couple had broken up with the younger Cuza refused his girlfriend&#x27;s demand that he marry her now that she was bearing his child. Though the scandal was hushed up, the fact that his sister was having an illegitimate child was deeply humiliating for Codreanu as he liked to present his family as model members of the Orthodox church and he sought unsuccessfully to have Cuza pressure his son to marry his sister.

Back in Iași, Codreanu created his own system of allegiance within the League, starting with the &quot;Frăția de Cruce&quot; (&quot;Brotherhood of the Cross&quot;, named after a variant of blood brotherhood which requires sermon with a cross). It gathered on 6 May 1924, in the countryside around Iași, starting work on the building of a student centre. This meeting was violently broken up by the authorities on orders from Romanian Police prefect Constantin Manciu. Codreanu and several others were allegedly beaten and tormented for several days, until Cuza&#x27;s intervention on their behalf proved effective.

After an interval of retreating from any political activity, Codreanu took revenge on Manciu, assassinating him and severely wounding some other policemen on 24 October 1924, in the Iași Tribunal building (where Manciu had been called to answer accusations, after one of Codreanu&#x27;s comrades had filed a complaint). Forensics showed that Manciu was not facing his killer at the moment of his death, which prompted Codreanu to indicate that he considered himself to be acting in self-defence based solely on Manciu&#x27;s earlier actions. Codreanu gave himself up immediately after firing his gun, and awaited trial in custody. The police force of Iași was unpopular with the public due to widespread corruption, and many locals saw the murder of Manciu as a heroic act by Codreanu. In the meantime, the issue was brought up in the Parliament of Romania by the Peasant Party&#x27;s Paul Bujor, who first made a proposal to review legislation dealing with political violence and sedition; it won the approval of the governing National Liberal Party, which, on 19 December, passed the &quot;Mârzescu Law&quot; (named after its proponent, Mârzescu, who had been appointed Minister of Justice). Its most notable, if indirect, effect was the banning of the Communist Party. In October and November debates between members of Parliament became heated, and Cuza&#x27;s group was singled out as morally responsible for the murder: Petre Andrei stated that &quot;Mr. Cuza aimed and Codreanu fired&quot;, to which Cuza replied by claiming his innocence, while theorizing that Manciu&#x27;s brutality was a justifiable cause for violent retaliation.

Although Codreanu was purposely tried far away from Iași at Turnu Severin, the authorities were unable to find a neutral jury. On the day he was acquitted, members of the jury, who deliberated for five minutes in all, showed up wearing badges with League symbols and swastikas (the symbol in use by Cuza&#x27;s League). After a triumphal return and an ostentatious wedding to Elena Ilinoiu, Codreanu clashed with Cuza for a second time and decided to defuse tensions by taking leave in France.

Codreanu&#x27;s wedding to Elena Ilinoiu in June 1925 in Focșani was the major social event in Romania that year; it was celebrated in lavish, pseudo-royal style and attended by thousands, attracting enormous media attention. After the wedding, Codreanu and his bride were followed by 3,000 ox-carts in a four-mile long procession of &quot;ecstatically happy&quot; peasants. One of Codreanu&#x27;s followers wrote at the time that Romanians loved royal spectacles, especially royal weddings, but since Crown Prince Carol had eloped first to marry a commoner in 1918 in a private wedding followed by a royal wedding in Greece, Codreanu&#x27;s wedding was the best substitute for the royal wedding that the Romanian people wanted to see. Codreanu&#x27;s wedding was meant to change his image from the romantic, restless, Byronic hero image he had held until then to a more &quot;settled&quot; image of a married man, and thus allay concerns held by more conservative Romanians about his social radicalism.

=== Creation of the Legion of the Archangel Michael ===
Codreanu returned from Grenoble to take part in the 1926 elections, and ran as a candidate for the town of Focșani. He lost, and, although it had had a considerable success, the League disbanded in the same year. Codreanu gathered former members of the League who had spent time in prison, and put into practice his dream of forming the Legion (November 1927, just days after the fall of a new Averescu cabinet, which had continued to support now-rival Cuza). Codreanu claimed to have had a vision of the Archangel Michael who told him he had been chosen by God to be Romania&#x27;s saviour. From the beginning, the Legion claimed that a commitment to the values of the Eastern Orthodox Church was central to its message, and Codreanu&#x27;s alleged vision was a centrepiece of his message.

Based on the &quot;Frăția de Cruce&quot;, Codreanu designed the Legion as a selective and autarkic group, paying allegiance to him and no other, and soon expanded it into a replicating network of political cells called &quot;nests&quot; (&quot;cuiburi&quot;). &quot;Frăția&quot; endured as the Legion&#x27;s most secretive and highest body, which requested from its members that they undergo a rite of passage, during which they swore allegiance to the &quot;Captain&quot;, as Codreanu was now known.

According to American historian Barbara Jelavich, the movement &quot;at first supported no set ideology, but instead emphasized the moral regeneration of the individual&quot;, while expressing a commitment to the Romanian Orthodox Church. The Legion introduced Orthodox rituals as part of its political rallies, while Codreanu made his public appearances dressed in folk costume — a traditionalist pose adopted at the time only by him and the National Peasant Party&#x27;s Ion Mihalache. Throughout its existence, the Legion maintained strong links with members of the Romanian Orthodox clergy, and its members fused politics with an original interpretation of Romanian Orthodox messages — including claims that the Romanian kin was expecting its national salvation, in a religious sense.

Such a mystical focus, Jelavich noted, was in tandem with a marked preoccupation for violence and self-sacrifice, &quot;but only if the [acts of terror] were committed for the good of the cause and subsequently expiated.&quot; Legionnaires engaged in violent or murderous acts often turned themselves in to be arrested, and it became common that violence was seen as a necessary step in a world that expected a Second Coming of Christ. With time, the Legion developed a doctrine around a cult of the fallen, going so far as to imply that the dead continued to form an integral part of a perpetual national community. As a consequence of its mysticism, the movement made a point of not adopting or advertising any particular platform, and Codreanu explained early on: &quot;The country is dying for lack of men and not for lack of political programs.&quot; Elsewhere, he pointed out that the Legion was interested in the creation of a &quot;new man&quot; (&quot;omul nou&quot;).

Despite its apparent lack of political messages, the movement was immediately noted for its antisemitism, for arguing that Romania was faced with a &quot;Jewish Question&quot; and for proclaiming that a Jewish presence thrived on uncouthness and pornography. The Legionary leader wrote: &quot;The historical mission of our generation is the resolution of the kike problem. All of our battles of the past 15 years have had this purpose, all of our life&#x27;s efforts from now on will have this purpose.&quot; He accused the Jews in general of attempting to destroy what he claimed was a direct link between Romania and God, and the Legion campaigned in favour of the notion that there was no actual connection between the Old Testament Hebrews and the modern Jews. In one instance, making a reference to the origin of the Romanians, Codreanu stated that Jews were corrupting the &quot;Roman-Dacian structure of our people.&quot; The Israeli historian Jean Ancel wrote that, from the mid-19th century onward, the Romanian &quot;intelligentsia&quot; had a &quot;schizophrenic attitude towards the West and its values&quot;. Romania been a strongly Francophile country starting in the 19th century, and most of the Romanian &quot;intelligentsia&quot; professed themselves believers in French ideas about the universal appeal of democracy, freedom, and human rights while at the same time holding antisemitic views about Romania&#x27;s Jewish minority. Ancel wrote that Codreanu was the first significant Romanian to reject not only the prevailing Francophilia of the &quot;intelligentsia&quot;, but also the entire framework of universal democratic values, which Codreanu claimed were &quot;Jewish inventions&quot; designed to destroy Romania.

He began openly calling for the destruction of Jews, and, as early as 1927, the new movement organized the sacking and burning of a synagogue in the city of Oradea. It thus profited from an exceptional popularity of antisemitism in Romanian society: according to one analysis, Romania was, with the exception of Poland, the most antisemitic country in Eastern Europe.

Codreanu&#x27;s message was among the most radical forms of Romanian antisemitism, and contrasted with the generally more moderate antisemitic views of Cuza&#x27;s former associate, the prominent historian Nicolae Iorga. The model favoured by the Legion was a form of racial antisemitism, and formed part of Codreanu&#x27;s theory that the Romanians were biologically distinct and superior to neighbouring or co-inhabiting ethnicities (including the Hungarian community). Codreanu also voiced his thoughts on the issue of Romanian expansionism, which show that he was pondering the incorporation of Soviet lands over the Dniester (in the region later annexed under the name of Transnistria) and planning a Romanian-led transnational federation centred on the Carpathians and the Danube.

In 1936, Codreanu published an essay entitled &quot;The Resurrection of the Race&quot;, where he wrote

I will under underline this once again: we are not up against a few pathetic individuals who have landed here by chance and who now seek protection and shelter. We are up against a fully-fledged Jewish state, an entire army which has come here with its sights set on conquest. The movement of the Jewish population and its penetration into Romania are being carried out in accordance with precise plans. In all probability, the &#x27;Great Jewish Council&#x27; is planning the creation of a new Palestine on a strip of land, starting out on the Baltic Sea, embraces a part of Poland and Czechoslovakia and half of Romania right across to the Black Sea...The worse thing that Jews and politicians have done to us, the greatest danger that they have exposed our people to, is not the way they are seizing the riches and possessions of our country, destroying the Romanian middle class, the way they swamp our schools and liberal professions, or the pernicious influence they are having on our whole political life, although these already constitute mortal dangers for a people. The greatest danger they pose to the people is rather that they are undermining us racially, that they are destroying the racial, Romano-Dacian structure of our people and call into being a type of human being that is nothing, but a racial wreck.&quot;

From early on, the movement registered significant gains among the middle-class and educated youth. However, according to various commentators, Codreanu won his most significant following in the rural environment, which in part reflected the fact that he and most other Legionary leaders were first-generation urban dwellers. American historian of fascism Stanley G. Payne, who noted that the Legion benefited from the 400% increase in university enrolment (&quot;proportionately more than anywhere else in Europe&quot;), has described the Captain and his network of disciples as &quot;a revolutionary alliance of students and poor peasants&quot;, which centred on the &quot;new underemployed intelligentsia prone to radical nationalism&quot;. Thus, a characteristic trait of the newly-founded movement was the young age of its leaders; later records show that the average age of the Legionary elite was 27.4.

By then also an anticapitalist, Codreanu identified in Jewry the common source of economic liberalism and communism, both seen as internationalist forces manipulated by a Judaic conspiracy. As an opponent of modernization and materialism, he only vaguely indicated that his movement&#x27;s economic goals implied a non-Marxian form of Collectivist anarchism, and presided over his followers&#x27; initiatives to set up various cooperatives.

=== First outlawing and parliamentary mandate ===
After more than two years of stagnation, Codreanu felt it necessary to amend the purpose of the movement: he and the leadership of the movement started touring rural regions, addressing the churchgoing illiterate population with the rhetoric of sermons, dressing up in long white mantles and instigating Christian prejudice against Judaism (this intense campaign was also prompted by the fact that the Legion was immediately sidelined by Cuza&#x27;s League in the traditionally-receptive Moldavian and Bukovinian centers). Between 1928 and 1930, the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod National Peasants&#x27; Party cabinet gave tacit assistance to the Guard, but Iuliu Maniu (representing the same party) clamped down on the Legion after July 1930. This came after the latter had tried to provoke a wave of pogroms in Maramureș and Bessarabia. In one notable incident of 1930, Legionnaires encouraged the peasant population of Borșa to attack the town&#x27;s 4,000 Jews.

The Legion also attempted to assassinate government officials and journalists, including Constantin Angelescu, undersecretary of Internal Affairs. Codreanu was briefly arrested together with the would-be assassin Gheorghe Beza: both were tried and acquitted. Nevertheless, the wave of violence and a planned march into Bessarabia signalled the outlawing of the party by Premier Gheorghe Mironescu and Minister of the Interior Ion Mihalache (January 1931); again arrested, Codreanu was acquitted in late February.

Having been boosted by the Great Depression in Romania and the malcontent it engendered, in 1931, the Legion also profited from the disagreement between King Carol II and the National Peasants&#x27; Party, which brought a cabinet formed around Nicolae Iorga. Codreanu was consequently elected to the Chamber of Deputies on the lists of the &quot;Corneliu Zelea Codreanu Grouping&quot; (the provisional name for the Guard), together with other prominent members of his original movement — including Ion Zelea, his father, and Mihai Stelescu, a young activist who ultimately came into conflict with the Legion; it is likely that the new Vaida-Voevod cabinet gave tacit support to the Grouping in subsequent partial elections. The Legion had won five seats in all, signalling its first important electoral gain.

Codreanu quickly became noted for exposing corruption of ministers and other politicians on a case-by-case basis (although several of his political adversaries at the time described him as &quot;bland and incompetent&quot;).

=== Clash with Duca and truce with Tătărescu ===

The authorities became increasingly concerned with the revolutionary potential of the Legion, and minor clashes in 1932 between the two introduced what became, from 1933, almost a decade of major political violence. The situation degenerated after Codreanu expressed his full support for Adolf Hitler and Nazism (even to the detriment of Italian fascism, and probably an added source for the conflict between the Captain and Stelescu). Romania was traditionally one of the most Francophile countries in Europe and had been allied to its &quot;Latin sister&quot; France since 1926, so Codreanu&#x27;s call for an alliance with Germany was very novel for the time. A new National Liberal cabinet, formed by Ion G. Duca, moved against such initiatives, stating that the Legion was acting as a puppet of the German Nazi Party, and ordering that a huge number of Legionnaires be arrested just prior to the new elections in 1933 (which the Liberals won). Some of the Legionnaires held in custody were killed by authorities. In retaliation, Duca was assassinated by the Iron Guard&#x27;s &quot;Nicadori&quot; death squad on 30 December 1933. Another result was the very first crackdown on non-affiliated sympathizers of the Iron Guard, after Nae Ionescu and allies protested against its repression.

Due to Duca&#x27;s killing, Codreanu was forced into hiding, awaiting calm and delegating leadership to General Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul, who later assumed partial guilt for the assassination. Legionnaire Mihai Stelescu, who would become Codreanu&#x27;s adversary as head of the splinter group &quot;Crusade of Romanianism&quot;, alleged that Codreanu had been given refuge by a cousin of Magda Lupescu, Carol&#x27;s mistress, implying that the Guard was becoming corrupt. Despite Codreanu&#x27;s attacks on the elite, at his trial in 1934 a number of respected politicians like Gheorghe I. Brătianu, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu testified for Codreanu as character witnesses. Codreanu was again acquitted.

As Duca had alleged, the Iron Guard did have some links to the Nazi Party&#x27;s foreign office under Alfred Rosenberg, but in 1933–34 the main local beneficiary of financial support from Rosenberg was Codreanu&#x27;s rival Octavian Goga, who lacked Codreanu&#x27;s mass following and thus was more biddable. A further issue for the Nazis was concern over Codreanu&#x27;s statements that Romania had too many minorities for its own good, which led to fears that Codreanu might persecute the &quot;volksdeutsch&quot; minority if he came to power. Though limited, the connections between the NSDAP and the Iron Guard added to the Legion&#x27;s appeal as the Iron Guard was associated in the public mind with the apparently dynamic and successful society of Nazi Germany.

Some time after the start of Gheorghe Tătărescu&#x27;s premiership and Ion Inculeț&#x27;s leadership of the Internal Affairs Ministry, repression of the Legion ceased, a measure which reflected Carol&#x27;s hope to ensure a new period of stability. In 1936, during a youth congress in Târgu Mureș, Codreanu agreed to the formation of a permanent &quot;Death Squad&quot;, which immediately showed its goals with the killing of dissident Mihai Stelescu by a group called the &quot;Decemviri&quot; (led by Ion Caratănase), neutralizing the &quot;Crusade of Romanianism&quot;&#x27;s anti-Legion campaign, and silencing Stelescu&#x27;s claims that Codreanu was politically corrupt, uncultured, a plagiarist, and hypocritical in his public display of asceticism.

1937 was marked by the deaths and ostentatious funerals of Ion Moța (by then, the movement&#x27;s vice president) and Vasile Marin, who had volunteered on Francisco Franco&#x27;s side in the Spanish Civil War and had been killed in the battle at Majadahonda. Codreanu also published his autobiographical and ideological essay &quot;Pentru legionari&quot; (&quot;For the Legionnaires&quot; or &quot;For My Legionnaires&quot;).

It was during this period that the Guard came to be financed by Nicolae Malaxa (otherwise known as a prominent collaborator of Carol), and became interested in reforming itself to reach an even wider audience: Codreanu created a meritocratic inner structure of ranks, established a wide range of philanthropic ventures, again voiced themes which appealed to the industrial workers, and created &quot;Corpul Muncitoresc Legionar&quot;, a Legion branch which grouped members of the working class. King Carol met difficulties in preserving his rule after being faced with a decline in the appeal of the more traditional parties, and, as Tătărescu&#x27;s term approached its end, Carol made an offer to Codreanu, demanding leadership of the Legion in exchange for a Legionary cabinet; this offer was promptly refused.

=== &quot;Everything for the Country&quot; Party ===

After the consequent ban on paramilitary groups, the Legion was restyled into a political party, running in elections as Totul Pentru Țară (&quot;Everything for the Country&quot;, acronym TPȚ). Shortly afterwards, Codreanu went on record stating his contempt for Romania&#x27;s alliances in Eastern Europe, in particular the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact, and indicating that, 48 hours after his movement came into power, the country would be aligned with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Reportedly, such trust and confidence was reciprocated by both German officials and Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano, the latter of whom viewed Goga&#x27;s cabinet as a transition to the Iron Guard&#x27;s rule.

In the elections of 1937, when it signed an electoral pact with the National Peasants&#x27; Party with the goal of preventing the government from making use of electoral fraud, TPȚ received 15.5% of the vote (occasionally rounded up to 16%). Despite failure to win the majority bonus, Codreanu&#x27;s movement was, at the time, the third most popular party in Romania, the only one whose popularity grew in 1937–1938, and by far the most popular fascist group.

The Legion was excluded from political coalitions by nominally fascist King Carol, who preferred newly-formed subservient movements and the revived National-Christian Defense League. Cuza created his antisemitic government together with poet Octavian Goga and his National Agrarian Party. Codreanu and the two leaders did not get along, and the Legion started competing with the authorities by adopting corporatism. In parallel, he urged his followers to set up private businesses, claiming to follow the advice of Nicolae Iorga, after the latter claimed that a Romanian-run commerce could prove a solution to what he deemed the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;.

The new government alliance, unified as the National Christian Party, gave itself a blue-shirted paramilitary corps that borrowed heavily from the Legion — the &quot;Lăncieri&quot; — and initiated an official campaign of persecution of Jews, attempting to win back the interest the public had in the Iron Guard. After much violence, Codreanu was approached by Goga and agreed to have his party withdraw from campaigning in the scheduled elections of 1938, believing that, in any event, the regime had no viable solution and would wear itself out — while attempting to profit from the king&#x27;s authoritarianism by showing his willingness to integrate any possible one-party system.

=== Clash with King Carol and 1938 trials ===
Codreanu&#x27;s designs were overturned by Carol, who deposed Goga, introducing his own dictatorship after his attempts to form a national government. The system relied instead on the new Constitution of 1938, the financial backing received from large business, and the winning over of several more or less traditional politicians, such as Nicolae Iorga and the Internal Affairs Minister Armand Călinescu (&quot;see National Renaissance Front&quot;). The ban on the Guard was again tightly enforced, with Călinescu ordering all public places known to have harboured Legion meetings to be closed down (including several restaurants in Bucharest). Members of the movement were placed under close surveillance or arrested in cases where they did not abide by the new legislation, while civil servants risked arrest if they were caught spreading Iron Guard propaganda.

The official and semi-official press began attacking Codreanu. He was thus virulently criticized by the magazine &quot;Neamul Românesc&quot;, which was edited by Iorga. When Carol felt he had sufficient control of the situation, he ordered a brutal suppression of the Iron Guard and had Codreanu arrested on the charge of slander, based on a letter Codreanu sent to Iorga on 26 March 1938, in which he had attacked him for collaborating with Carol, calling Iorga &quot;morally dishonest&quot;. Codreanu referred to the historian&#x27;s charge that Legionary commerce was financing rebellion, and argued that this strategy had originated from Iorga&#x27;s own arguments. Nicolae Iorga replied by filing a complaint with the Military Tribunal and by writing Codreanu a letter which advised him to &quot;descend in [his] conscience to find remorse&quot; for &quot;the amount of blood spilled over him&quot;.

Upon being informed of the indictment, Codreanu urged his followers not to take any action if he was going to be sentenced to less than six months in prison, stressing that he wanted to give an example of dignity; however, he also ordered a group of Legionnaires to defend him in case of an attack by the authorities. He was arrested together with 44 other prominent members of the movement, including Ion Zelea Codreanu, Gheorghe Clime, Alexandru Cristian Tell, Radu Gyr, Nae Ionescu, Șerban Milcoveanu and Mihail Polihroniade, on the evening of 16 April. The crackdown coincided with the Orthodox celebration of Palm Sunday (when those targeted were known to be in their homes). After a short stay in the Romanian Police Prefecture, Codreanu was dispatched to Jilava Prison, while the other prisoners were sent to Tismana Monastery (and later to concentration camps such as the one in Miercurea Ciuc).

Codreanu was tried for slander and sentenced to six months in jail, before the authorities indicted him for treason, sedition, and for the crimes of politically organizing underage students, issuing orders inciting to violence, maintaining links with foreign organizations, and organizing fire practices. Of the people to give evidence in his favour at the trial, the best-known was General Ion Antonescu, who would later become &quot;Conducător&quot; and Premier of Romania.

The two trials were marked by irregularities, and Codreanu accused the judges and prosecutors of conducting it in a &quot;Bolshevik&quot; manner, because he had not been allowed to speak in his own defence. He sought the counsel of the prominent lawyers Istrate Micescu and Grigore Iunian, but was refused by both, and, as a consequence, his defence team comprised Legionary activists with little experience. They were several times prevented by the authorities from preparing their pleas. The conditions of his imprisonment were initially harsh: his cell was damp and cold, which caused him health problems.

==== Prison sentence ====
Codreanu was eventually sentenced to ten years of hard labour in the salt mines. According to historian Ilarion Țiu, the trial and verdict were received with general apathy, and the only political faction believed to have organized a public rally in connection with it was the outlawed Romanian Communist Party, some of whose members gathered in front of the tribunal to express support for the conviction. The Legionary Movement itself grew disorganized, and provincial bodies of the Legion came to exercise control over the centre, which had been weakened by the arrests. As the political establishment&#x27;s main branches welcomed the news of Codreanu&#x27;s sentencing, the Iron Guard organized a retaliation attack targeting the National Peasant Party&#x27;s Virgil Madgearu, who had become known for expressing his opposition to the movement&#x27;s extremism (Madgearu managed to escape the violence unharmed).

Codreanu was moved from Jilava to Doftana Prison, where, despite the sentence, he was not required to perform any form of physical work. The conditions of his detention improved, and he was allowed to regularly communicate with his family and subordinates. At the time, he rejected all possibility of an escape, and ordered the Legion to refrain from violent acts. A provisional leadership team was also organized, consisting of Ion Antoniu, Ion Belgae, Radu Mironovici, Iordache Nicoară, and Horia Sima. However, the provisional leadership, against Codreanu&#x27;s wishes, announced that he was faring badly in prison and threatened further retaliation, to the point where the prison staff increased security as a means to prevent a potential break-in.

In the autumn, following the successful Nazi German expansion into Central Europe which seemed to provide momentum for the Guard, and even moreso the international context provided by the Munich Agreement and the First Vienna Award, its clandestine leadership grew confident and published manifestos threatening King Carol. Those members of the Iron Guard who escaped persecution or were omitted in the first place started a violent campaign throughout Romania, meant to coincide with Carol&#x27;s visit to Hitler at the Berghof, as a way to prevent the tentative approach between Romania and Nazi Germany. Confident that Hitler was not determined on supporting the Legion, and irritated by the incidents, Carol ordered the decapitation of the movement.

=== Death ===
On 30 November, it was announced that Codreanu, the &quot;Nicadori&quot; and the &quot;Decemviri&quot; had been shot after trying to flee custody the previous night. The actual details were revealed much later: the fourteen persons had been transported from their prison and executed (strangled or garroted and shot) by the Gendarmerie around Tâncăbești (near Bucharest), and their bodies had been buried in the courtyard of the Jilava Prison. Their bodies were dissolved in acid, and placed under seven tons of concrete.

=== Lifetime influence and Legionary power ===

According to Adrian Cioroianu, Codreanu was &quot;the most successful political and at the same time anti-political model of interwar Romania&quot;. The Legion was described by British researcher Norman Davies as &quot;one of Europe&#x27;s more violent fascist movements.&quot; Stanley G. Payne argued that the Iron Guard was &quot;probably the most unusual mass movement of interwar Europe&quot;, and noted that part of this was owed to Codreanu being &quot;a sort of religious mystic&quot;; British historian James Mayall saw the Legion as &quot;the most singular of the lesser fascist movements&quot;.

The charismatic leadership represented by Codreanu has drawn comparisons with models favoured by other leaders of far-right and fascist movements, including Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Payne and German historian Ernst Nolte proposed that, among European far-rightists, Codreanu was most like Hitler in what concerns fanaticism. In Payne&#x27;s view, however, he was virtually unparalleled in demanding &quot;self-destructiveness&quot; from his followers. Mayall, who states the Legion &quot;was inspired in large measure by National Socialism and fascism&quot;, argues that Corneliu Zelea Codreanu&#x27;s vision of &quot;omul nou&quot;, although akin to the &quot;new man&quot; of Nazi and Italian doctrines, is characterized by an unparalleled focus on mysticism. Historian Renzo De Felice, who dismisses the notion that Nazism and fascism are connected, also argues that, due to Legionary attack on &quot;bourgeois values and institutions&quot;, which the fascist ideology wanted instead to &quot;purify and perfect&quot;, Codreanu &quot;was not, strictly speaking, a fascist.&quot; Spanish historian Francisco Veiga argued that &quot;fascization&quot; was a process experienced by the Guard, accumulating traits over a more generic nationalist fibre.

According to American journalist R. G. Waldeck, who was present in Romania in 1940–1941, the violent killing of Codreanu only served to cement his popularity and arouse interest in his cause. She wrote: &quot;To the Rumanian people the Capitano [sic, &quot;Căpitanul&quot;] remained a saint and a martyr and the apostle of a better Rumania. Even skeptical ones who did not agree with him in political matters still grew dreamy-eyed remembering Codreanu.&quot; Historiographer Lucian Boia notes that Codreanu, his rival Carol II, and military leader Ion Antonescu were each in turn perceived as &quot;savior&quot; figures by the Romanian public, and that, unlike other such examples of popular men, they all preached authoritarianism. Cioroianu also writes that Codreanu&#x27;s death &quot;whether or not paradoxically, would increase the personage&#x27;s charisma and would turn him straight into a legend.&quot; Attitudes similar to those described by Waldeck were relatively widespread among Romanian youths, many of whom came to join the Iron Guard out of admiration for the deceased Codreanu while still in middle or high school.

Under the leadership of Horia Sima, the Iron Guard eventually came to power for a five-month period in 1940–1941, proclaiming the fascist National Legionary State and forming an uneasy partnership with &quot;Conducător&quot; Ion Antonescu. This was a result of Carol&#x27;s downfall, effected by the Second Vienna Award, through which Romania had lost Northern Transylvania to Hungary. On 25 November 1940, an investigation was carried out on the Jilava Prison premises. The discovery of Codreanu and his associates&#x27; remains caused the Legionnaires to engage in a reprisal against the new regime&#x27;s political prisoners, who were then detained in the same prison. On the next night, sixty-four inmates were shot, while on the 27 and 28 November there were fresh arrests and swift executions, with prominent victims such as Iorga and Virgil Madgearu (&quot;see: Jilava Massacre&quot;). The resulting widespread disorder brought the first open clash between Antonescu and the Legion. During the events, Codreanu was posthumously exonerated of all charges by a Legionary tribunal. His exhumation was a grandiose ceremony, marked by the participation of Romania&#x27;s new ally, Nazi Germany: &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; planes dropped wreaths on Codreanu&#x27;s open tomb.

Codreanu&#x27;s wife Elena withdrew from the public eye after her husband&#x27;s killing, but, after the communist regime took hold, was arrested and deported to the Bărăgan, where she grew close to women aviators of the White Squadron. She also met and married Barbu Praporgescu (son of General David Praporgescu), moving in with him in Bucharest after their liberation. Widowed for a second time, she spent her final years with her relatives in Moldavia.

=== Codreanu and modern-day political discourse ===
The movement was eventually toppled from power by Antonescu as a consequence of the Legionnaires&#x27; Rebellion. The events associated with Sima&#x27;s term in office resulted in conflicts and infighting within the Legion and its contemporary successors: many &quot;Codrenist&quot; Legionnaires claim to obey Codreanu and his father Ion Zelea, but not Sima, while, at the same time, the &quot;Simist&quot; faction claims to have followed Codreanu&#x27;s guidance and inspiration in carrying out violent acts.

Codreanu had an enduring influence in Italy. His views and style were attested to have influenced the controversial Traditionalist philosopher and racial theorist Julius Evola. Evola himself met with Codreanu on one occasion, and, in the words of his friend, the writer and historian Mircea Eliade, was &quot;dazzled&quot;. Reportedly, the visit had been arranged by Eliade and philosopher Vasile Lovinescu, both of whom sympathized with the Iron Guard. Their guest later wrote that the Iron Guard founder was: &quot;one of the worthiest and spiritually best oriented figures that I ever met in the nationalist movements of the time.&quot; According to De Felice, Codreanu has also become a main reference point for the Italian neofascist groups, alongside Evola and the ideologues of Nazism. He argues that this phenomenon, which tends to shadow references to Italian Fascism itself, is owed to Mussolini&#x27;s failures in setting up &quot;a true fascist state&quot;, and to the subsequent need of finding other role models. Evola&#x27;s disciple and prominent neofascist activist Franco Freda published several of Codreanu&#x27;s essays at his &quot;Edizioni di Ar&quot;, while their follower Claudio Mutti was noted for his pro-Legionary rhetoric.

In parallel, Codreanu is seen as a hero by representatives of the maverick Neo-Nazi movement known as Strasserism, and in particular by the British-based Strasserist International Third Position (ITP), which uses one of Codreanu&#x27;s statements as its motto. Codreanu&#x27;s activities and mystical interpretation of politics were probably an inspiration on Russian politician Alexander Barkashov, founder of the far right Russian National Unity.

After the Romanian Revolution toppled the communist regime, various extremist groups began claiming to represent Codreanu&#x27;s legacy. Reportedly, one of the first was the short-lived &quot;Mișcarea pentru România&quot; (&quot;Movement for Romania&quot;), founded by the student leader Marian Munteanu. It was soon followed by the Romanian branch of the ITP and its Timișoara-based mouthpiece, the journal &quot;Gazeta de Vest&quot;, as well as by other groups claiming to represent the Legionary legacy. Among the latter is Noua Dreaptă, which depicts Codreanu as a spiritual figure, often with attributes equivalent to those of a Romanian Orthodox saint. Each year around 30 November, these diverse groups have been known to reunite in Tâncăbești, where they organize festivities to commemorate Codreanu&#x27;s death.

In the early 2000s, Gigi Becali, a Romanian businessman, owner of the Steaua București football club, and leader of the right-wing New Generation Party, stated that he admired Codreanu and made attempts to capitalize on Legionary symbols and rhetoric, such as adopting a slogan originally coined by the Iron Guard: &quot;I vow to God that I shall make Romania in the likeness of the holy sun in the sky&quot;. The statement, used by Becali during the 2004 presidential campaign, owed its inspiration to Legionary songs and was found in a much-publicized homage sent by Ion Moța to his Captain in 1937; it is also said to have been used by Codreanu himself. As a result of it, Becali was argued to have broken the 2002 government ordinance banning the use of fascist discourse. However, the Central Electoral Bureau rejected complaints against Becali, ruling that the slogan was not &quot;identical&quot; to the Legionary one. During the same period, Becali, speaking live in front of Oglinda Television cameras, called for Codreanu to be canonized. The station was fined 50 million lei by the National Audiovisual Council (around $1,223 USD in 2004).

In a poll of the Romanian public conducted by Romanian Television in 2006, Codreanu was voted 22nd among the 100 Greatest Romanians, coming in between Steaua footballer Mirel Rădoi at 21 and the interwar democratic politician Nicolae Titulescu at 23.

In modern Romanian politics, Codreanu&#x27;s legacy has drawn praise from members of the nationalist Alliance for the Union of Romanians party.

=== Cultural references ===
Late in the 1930s, Codreanu&#x27;s supporters began publishing books praising his virtues, among which are Vasile Marin&#x27;s &quot;Crez de Generație&quot; (&quot;Generation Credo&quot;) and Nicolae Roșu&#x27;s &quot;Orientări în Veac&quot; (&quot;Orientations in the Century&quot;), both published in 1937. After the National Legionary State officially hailed Corneliu Zelea Codreanu as a martyr to the cause, his image came to be used as a propaganda tool in cultural contexts. Codreanu was integrated into the Legionary cult of death: usually at Iron Guard rallies, Codreanu and other fallen members were mentioned and greeted with the shout &quot;Prezent!&quot; (&quot;Present!&quot;). His personality cult was reflected in Legionary art, and a stylized image of him was displayed at major rallies, including the notorious and large-scale Bucharest ceremony of 6 October 1940. Although Codreanu was officially condemned by the communist regime a generation later, it is possible that, in its final stage under Nicolae Ceaușescu, it came to use the Captain&#x27;s personality cult as a source of inspiration. The post-communist Noua Dreaptă, which publicizes portraits of Codreanu in the form of Orthodox icons, often makes use of such representation in its public rallies, usually associating it with its own symbol, the Celtic cross.

In November 1940, the Legionary journalist Ovid Țopa, publishing in the Guard&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Buna Vestire&quot;, claimed that Codreanu stood alongside the mythical Dacian prophet and &quot;precursor of Christ&quot; Zalmoxis, the 15th century Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great, and Romania&#x27;s national poet Mihai Eminescu, as an essential figure of Romanian history and Romanian spirituality. Other Legionary texts of the time drew a similar parallel between Codreanu, Eminescu, and the 18th-century Transylvanian Romanian peasant leader Horea. Thus, in 1937, sociologist Ernest Bernea had authored &quot;Cartea căpitanilor&quot; (&quot;The Book of Captains&quot;), where the preferred comparison was between Codreanu, Horea, and Horea&#x27;s 19th-century counterparts Tudor Vladimirescu and Avram Iancu. Also in November 1940, Codreanu was the subject of a conference given by the young philosopher Emil Cioran and aired by the state-owned Romanian Radio, in which Cioran notably praised the Guard&#x27;s leader for &quot;having given Romania a purpose&quot;. Other tribute pieces in various media came from other radical intellectuals of the period: Eliade, brothers Arșavir and Haig Acterian, Traian Brăileanu, Nichifor Crainic, N. Crevedia, Radu Gyr, Traian Herseni, Nae Ionescu, Constantin Noica, Petre P. Panaitescu, and Marietta Sadova.

The Legionary leader was portrayed in a poem by his follower Radu Gyr, who notably spoke of Codreanu&#x27;s death as a prelude to his resurrection. In contrast, Codreanu&#x27;s schoolmate Petre Pandrea, who spent part of his life as a Romanian Communist Party affiliate, left an unflattering memoir of their encounters, used as a preferential source in texts on Codreanu published during the communist period. Despite his earlier confrontation with the Iron Guard, the leftist poet Tudor Arghezi is thought by some to have deplored Codreanu&#x27;s killing, and to have alluded to it in his poem version of the &quot;Făt-Frumos&quot; stories. Mircea Eliade, whose early Legionary sympathies became a notorious topic of outrage, was indicated by his disciple Ioan Petru Culianu to have based Eugen Cucoanes, the main character in his novella &quot;Un om mare&quot; (&quot;A Big Man&quot;), on Codreanu. This hypothesis was commented upon by literary critics Matei Călinescu and Mircea Iorgulescu, the latter of whom argued that there was too-little evidence to support it. The neofascist Claudio Mutti claimed that Codreanu inspired the character Ieronim Thanase in Eliade&#x27;s &quot;Nouăsprăzece trandafiri&quot; (&quot;Nineteen Roses&quot;) story, a view rejected by Călinescu.

<text>The 1984 Canadian federal election was held on September 4, 1984, to elect members to the House of Commons of the 33rd Parliament of Canada.

In the largest landslide victory in Canadian political history, the Progressive Conservative Party (PC Party), led by Brian Mulroney, defeated the incumbent governing Liberal Party led by Prime Minister John Turner. This was the first election since 1958 in which the PC Party won a majority government and is also the only time since 1958 that Canada&#x27;s governing party received an actual majority of votes cast.

Mulroney&#x27;s victory came as a result of his building of a &#x27;grand coalition&#x27; that comprised social conservatives from the West, Red Tories from the East, Quebec nationalists, and fiscal conservatives. Mulroney&#x27;s PCs won the largest number of seats in Canadian history at 211. Winning 74.8 percent of the seats in the House of Commons, meant they won the second-largest percentage of seats in Canadian history. Only Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker&#x27;s triumph in the 1958 federal election, at 78.5 percent, was higher. This was the last time that the winning party won every province and territory and the last time that the winning party received over 50 percent of the national popular vote. The Liberals suffered what at that time was the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level (in terms of percentage of seats). The New Democratic Party (NDP) saw no significant change to their seat count.

The election marked the end of the Liberals&#x27; long dominance of federal politics in Quebec, a province which had been the bedrock of Liberal support for almost a century. They would not win a majority of Quebec seats again until three decades later in 2015.

==Background==
The election was fought almost entirely on the record of the Liberals, who had been in power for all but one year since 1963.

Pierre Trudeau, who had been prime minister from 1968 to 1979 and again since 1980, retired from politics in early 1984. He was succeeded by John Turner, a former Cabinet minister under both Trudeau and Lester B. Pearson.

Turner had been out of politics for nine years; he was not an MP during this election campaign. Upon assuming the leadership, he made immediate changes in an attempt to rebuild the Liberals&#x27; struggling reputation. For example, he announced that he would not run in a by-election to return to the House of Commons, but would instead run in the next general election as the Liberal candidate in Vancouver Quadra, British Columbia. This was a sharp departure from usual practice for a Westminster system, in which the incumbent in a safe seat resigns to allow a newly elected party leader a chance to get into Parliament. But the Liberal Party had lost favour with western Canadians, and policies such as the National Energy Program only aggravated this sentiment. Turner&#x27;s plan to run in a western Canada riding was, in part, an attempt to rebuild support in that region. Going into the election, the Liberals held only one seat west of Ontario—that of Lloyd Axworthy, from Winnipeg—Fort Garry, Manitoba.

More seriously, there was great disaffection in Quebec with the Liberal government, despite their traditional support for the party. Conflict between the provincial and federal parties, a series of scandals, and the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution without the approval of the Quebec provincial government had damaged the Liberals&#x27; brand in the province. Hoping for success in Quebec, leader Joe Clark began actively courting soft nationalist voters in the province. This was also a main reason why businessman Brian Mulroney, a fluently bilingual native of Quebec, was chosen as Clark&#x27;s replacement.

Although Turner was not required to call an election until 1985, internal data initially showed that the Liberals had regained the lead in opinion polls. Turner and his advisers were also mindful of the fact that Trudeau had seemingly missed an opportunity to take advantage of favourable opinion polls in the latter half of the 1970s, when he waited the full five years to call an election only to go down to an (albeit temporary) defeat. Additionally, several by-election losses and floor crossings had eroded the large majority that the Liberals had won four years earlier. By 1984, the Liberals&#x27; position in the house had been whittled down close to being a minority government, leaving Turner in danger of being toppled by a motion of no confidence, in addition to the fact that Turner himself was not actually a member of the House of Commons, a constitutionally unique and unprecedented occurrence. With this in mind, the new Prime Minister requested that Queen Elizabeth II delay her tour of Canada, and asked Governor General Jeanne Sauvé to dissolve Parliament on July 9. In accordance with Canadian constitutional practice, Sauvé granted the request and set the election for September 4.

==Campaign==
The Liberals&#x27; early lead began to slip as Turner made several prominent gaffes. In particular, he spoke of creating new &quot;make work programs&quot;, a concept from earlier decades that had been replaced by the less patronizing-sounding &quot;job creation programs&quot;. He also was caught on camera patting Liberal Party president Iona Campagnolo on her posterior. Turner defended this action as being a friendly gesture, but it was seen by many as condescending.

Other voters turned against the Liberals due to their mounting legacy of patronage and corruption. An especially important issue was Trudeau&#x27;s recommendation that Sauvé appoint over 200 Liberals to patronage posts just before he left office. This action enraged Canadians on all sides. Turner had the right to advise that the appointments be withdrawn, which Sauvé would have had to do according to constitutional convention. However, Turner not only didn&#x27;t do so, but appointed more than 70 Liberals to patronage posts himself despite a promise to bring a new way of politics to Ottawa. He cited a written agreement with Trudeau, claiming that if Trudeau had made the appointments, the Liberals would have almost certainly lost the election. However, the fact that Turner dropped the writ a year early hurt his argument.

Turner found out that Mulroney was allegedly setting up a patronage machine in anticipation of victory. At the English-language televised debate between Mulroney, Turner and New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent, Turner started to attack Mulroney on his patronage plans, comparing them to the patronage machine run by old Union Nationale in Quebec. However, Mulroney turned the tables by pointing to the raft of patronage appointments made on the advice of Trudeau and Turner. Claiming that he&#x27;d gone so far as to apologize for making light of &quot;these horrible appointments,&quot; Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize to the country for not cancelling the appointments advised by Trudeau and for recommending his own appointments. Turner was visibly surprised, and could only reply that &quot;I had no option&quot; except to let the appointments stand. Mulroney famously responded:

You had an option, sir. You could have said, &#x27;I am not going to do it. This is wrong for Canada, and I am not going to ask Canadians to pay the price.&#x27; You had an option, sir—to say &#x27;no&#x27;—and you chose to say &#x27;yes&#x27; to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party. That sir, if I may say respectfully, that is not good enough for Canadians.

Turner, clearly flustered by this withering riposte from Mulroney, could only repeat &quot;I had no option.&quot; A visibly angry Mulroney called this &quot;an avowal of failure&quot; and &quot;a confession of non-leadership.&quot; He told Turner, &quot;You had an option, sir. You could have done better.&quot; Mulroney&#x27;s counterattack led most of the papers the next day; it was often paraphrased as &quot;You had an option, sir; you could have said &#x27;no&#x27;.&quot; Many observers saw this as the end of any realistic chance for Turner to stay in power.

===Final days===

The last days of the campaign saw multiple Liberal blunders pile together. Turner continued to refer to &quot;make work projects&quot; and made other gaffes that caused voters to see him as a relic from the past. Turner even rehired much of Trudeau&#x27;s staff during the final weeks in an attempt to turn the tide, but this did nothing to reverse sliding poll numbers. Even Trudeau himself did not campaign for Turner, instead only making appearances to support Liberal candidates.

Besides the Tories, the NDP also benefited from the slip in Liberal support. Under Broadbent, the party had seen greater support in opinion polling than ever before, and had actually replaced the Liberals as the second party in much of western Canada.

==Results analysis==
===Liberals===

Turner&#x27;s inability to overcome the alleged resentment against Trudeau, combined with his own mistakes, resulted in a debacle for the Liberals. They lost over a third of their popular vote from 1980, falling from 44 percent to 28 percent. Their seat count fell from 135 at dissolution to 40, a loss of 95 seats—the second worst defeat of a sitting government in Canadian history at the time (after the 1935 election), and among the worst defeats ever suffered by a governing party in a Westminster system. It was the worst performance in their long history at the time; the 40 seats would be their smallest seat count until they won only 34 seats in 2011, when they also fell to third place in the seat count for the first time at the national level. Eleven members of Turner&#x27;s cabinet were defeated.

Despite their hopes of winning more support in the West, the Liberals won only two seats west of Ontario. One of those belonged to Turner, who defeated Tory incumbent Bill Clarke in Vancouver Quadra by a fairly solid 3,200-vote margin. The other belonged to Lloyd Axworthy who was re-elected in Winnipeg—Fort Garry by 2,300 votes.

Particularly shocking was the decimation of the Liberals in Quebec. They won only 17 seats, all but four in and around Montreal. The province had been the bedrock of Liberal support for almost a century; the 1958 Tory landslide was the only time since the 1896 election that the Liberals had not won the most seats in Quebec. They would not win the most seats in the province again until the 2015 election (albeit they won the province&#x27;s popular vote in 2000). In Ontario, the Liberals won only 14 seats, nearly all of them in Metro Toronto.

===Progressive Conservatives===

Early in the election, Mulroney focused on adding Quebec nationalists to the traditional Tory coalition of western populist conservatives and fiscal conservatives from Ontario and the Atlantic provinces.

This strategy, as well as denouncing alleged corruption in the Liberal government, resulted in a major windfall for the Tories. They won 211 seats, three more than their previous record of 208 in 1958-the only other time a Canadian party won 200 seats at an election. They won both a majority of seats and at least a plurality of the popular vote in every province and territory, the only time in Canadian history a party has achieved this (the nearest previous occasion being in 1949, when only Alberta kept the Liberals from a clean sweep). They also won just over half the popular vote, the last time to date that a Canadian party has won a majority of the popular vote.

The Tories had a major breakthrough in Quebec, a province where they had been virtually unelectable for almost a century. However, Mulroney&#x27;s promise of a new deal for Quebec caused the province to swing dramatically to support him. After winning only one seat out of 75 in 1980, the Tories won 58 seats in 1984, eight more than they had won in 1958, their previous high water mark in the province. In many cases, ridings where few living residents had ever been represented by a Tory elected them by margins similar to those the Liberals had scored for years.

===New Democrats===

The NDP had a net loss of one seat, which was far better than expected considering the size of the PC tidal wave. Historically, third parties do not do well in landslides, especially in a first-past-the-post system that awards power solely based on seat count. Despite losing less than a percentage point in terms of total vote share, the NDP still finished with less than two-thirds of the Liberals&#x27; popular vote. However, the NDP vote proved itself to be much more efficient since it was not as evenly distributed across the country. While they were a distant third everywhere east of Ontario, the NDP won only one seat fewer than the Liberals in Ontario despite finishing a distant third there as well. In Western Canada, the NDP lost seats to the Tories but was by far the second-largest party behind the Tories. Some NDP incumbents essentially held on to their own share of the vote, and simply had to survive a swing from Liberal to PC which in many cases proved insufficient to unseat the sitting NDP MP.

More importantly, their 30 seats were only ten behind the Liberals. Although the NDP had long since established itself as the third major party in Canada, this was closer than any party had gotten to the Grits or Tories since 1921, when the Progressive Party briefly surpassed the Tories. This led to speculation that Canada was headed for a UK-style Labour–Conservative division, with the NDP knocking the Liberals down to third-party status. It would be as close as the NDP would get to becoming the Official Opposition until 2011, when the party gained the second-most seats in the House of Commons and the majority of seats in Quebec.

===Other parties===

The Social Credit Party, which for a long time had been the country&#x27;s fourth-largest (and occasionally even third-largest) party, suffered a massive drop-off in support from the previous election, in which they had already lost a major share of the vote and all their remaining MPs. Having performed poorly in various by-elections in the years that followed, the party suffered a blow to its image in June 1983, when the party executive voted to re-admit a faction led by Holocaust denier James Keegstra. Party leader Martin Hattersley resigned in protest and was replaced by Ken Sweigard, who publicly endorsed Keegstra&#x27;s role in the party (if not his personal views) and allowed him to run as the Social Credit candidate in Red Deer. This, along with Sweigard instituting a new party-wide policy of not engaging with the press, caused the drop in support that had begun at the previous election to accelerate dramatically.

In Quebec, most of the support which had helped keep the party viable in its final years turned to the Progressive Conservatives. The party essentially disappeared there—even among ridings the party had won as recently as 1979, it could field only one candidate (who finished in last place). What remained of Social Credit essentially reverted to being a western-based party, which was only able to run 52 candidates in 51 ridings (with two Socreds standing in a British Columbia seat), none of whom came even close to being elected. It was its second-smallest slate since first running candidates east of Manitoba four decades earlier, and barely enough to allow Social Credit to retain its party registration. The party lost 92 percent of its vote from 1980 and dropped from fourth place to ninth in the popular vote. For all intents and purposes, this was the end of Social Credit as a viable national party. It would make a desultory final appearance in 1988 before collapsing altogether in 1993.

The satirical Rhinoceros Party, despite a slight drop in their popular vote tally from the previous election, recorded its highest-ever finish at a general election, finishing as the fourth-largest party. Of the minor parties, only the Parti nationaliste du Québec and the Confederation of Regions Party of Canada managed to record more votes per candidate than the Rhinos, and even then only by small margins.

The Parti nationaliste du Québec, a successor to the previous Quebec-nationalist Union populaire party, ran for the first (and, ultimately, only) time in this election. Despite getting nearly six times the votes that their predecessors did in 1980, and finishing fifth in the popular vote, like the Socreds they proved unable to compete with the Progressive Conservatives, and failed to win any seats. The party would eventually collapse in 1987, though several of its members, along with dissident Tories and Liberals, would go on to found the more successful Bloc Québécois.

The Confederation of Regions Party of Canada, formed mostly by disaffected former Socreds, were another party who debuted in this election. While they placed sixth in the popular vote and attracted a little over quadruple the vote of their forerunners, they still failed to seriously challenge for any seats. Much like the Socreds, they too disappeared from the national scene after 1988, though they continued on a regional level for several years afterwards.

<text>The American Chemical Society (ACS) is a scientific society based in the United States that supports scientific inquiry in the field of chemistry. Founded in 1876 at New York University, the ACS currently has more than 155,000 members at all degree levels and in all fields of chemistry, chemical engineering, and related fields. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest scientific societies by membership. The ACS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code. Its headquarters are located in Washington, D.C., and it has a large concentration of staff in Columbus, Ohio.

The ACS is a leading source of scientific information through its peer-reviewed scientific journals, national conferences, and the Chemical Abstracts Service. Its publications division produces over 80 scholarly journals including the prestigious &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot;, as well as the weekly trade magazine &quot;Chemical &amp; Engineering News&quot;. The ACS holds national meetings twice a year covering the complete field of chemistry and also holds smaller conferences concentrating on specific chemical fields or geographic regions. The primary source of income of the ACS is the Chemical Abstracts Service, a provider of chemical databases worldwide.

The ACS has student chapters in virtually every major university in the United States and outside the United States as well. These student chapters mainly focus on volunteering opportunities, career development, and the discussion of student and faculty research. The organization also publishes textbooks, administers several national chemistry awards, provides grants for scientific research, and supports various educational and outreach activities.

The ACS has been criticized for predatory pricing of its products (SciFinder, journals and other publications), for opposing open access publishing, as well as for initiating numerous copyright enforcement litigations despite its non-profit status and its chartered commitment to dissemination of chemical information.

== History ==
=== Creation ===
In 1874, a group of American chemists gathered at the Joseph Priestley House to mark the 100th anniversary of Priestley&#x27;s discovery of oxygen. Although there was an American scientific society at that time (the American Association for the Advancement of Science, founded in 1848), the growth of chemistry in the U.S. prompted those assembled to consider founding a new society that would focus more directly on theoretical and applied chemistry. Two years later, on April 6, 1876, during a meeting of chemists at the University of the City of New York (now New York University) the American Chemical Society was founded. The society received its charter of incorporation from the State of New York in 1877.

Charles F. Chandler, a professor of chemistry at Columbia University who was instrumental in organizing the society said that such a body would &quot;prove a powerful and healthy stimulus to original research, ... would awaken and develop much talent now wasting in isolation, ... [bring] members of the association into closer union, and ensure a better appreciation of our science and its students on the part of the general public.&quot;

Although Chandler was a likely choice to become the society&#x27;s first president because of his role in organizing the society, New York University chemistry professor John William Draper was elected as the first president of the society because of his national reputation. Draper was a photochemist and pioneering photographer who had produced one of the first photographic portraits in 1840. Chandler would later serve as president in 1881 and 1889.

In the ACS logo, originally designed in the early 20th century by Tiffany&#x27;s Jewelers and used since 1909, a stylized symbol of a kaliapparat is used.

=== Growth ===
The &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot; was founded in 1879 to publish original chemical research. It was the first journal published by ACS and is still the society&#x27;s flagship peer-reviewed publication. In 1907, Chemical Abstracts was established as a separate journal (it previously appeared within JACS), which later became the Chemical Abstracts Service, a division of ACS that provides chemical information to researchers and others worldwide. &quot;Chemical &amp; Engineering News&quot; is a weekly trade magazine that has been published by ACS since 1923.

The society adopted a new constitution aimed at nationalizing the organization in 1890. In 1905, the American Chemical Society moved from New York City to Washington, D.C. ACS was reincorporated under a congressional charter in 1937. It was granted by the U.S. Congress and signed by president Franklin D. Roosevelt. ACS&#x27;s headquarters moved to its current location in downtown Washington in 1941.

==Organization==

=== Divisions ===
ACS first established technical divisions in 1908 to foster the exchange of information among scientists who work in particular fields of chemistry or professional interests. Divisional activities include organizing technical sessions at ACS meetings, publishing books and resources, administering awards and lectureships, and conducting other events. The original five divisions were 1) organic chemistry, 2) industrial chemists and chemical engineers, 3) agricultural and food chemistry, 4) fertilizer chemistry, and 5) physical and inorganic chemistry.

 there are 32 technical divisions of ACS.

==== Division of Organic Chemistry ====
This is the largest division of the Society. It marked its 100th anniversary in 2008. The first Chair of the Division was Edward Curtis Franklin. The Organic Division played a part in establishing Organic Syntheses, Inc. and Organic Reactions, Inc. and it maintains close ties to both organizations.

The Division&#x27;s best known activities include organizing symposia (talks and poster sessions) at the biannual ACS National Meetings, for the purpose of recognizing promising Assistant Professors, talented young researchers, outstanding technical contributions from junior-level chemists, in the field of organic chemistry. The symposia also honor national award winners, including the Arthur C. Cope Award, Cope Scholar Award, James Flack Norris Award in Physical Organic Chemistry, Herbert C. Brown Award for Creative Research in Synthetic Methods.

The Division helps to organize symposia at the international meeting called Pacifichem and it organizes the biennial National Organic Chemistry Symposium (NOS) which highlights recent advances in organic chemistry and hosts the Roger Adams Award address. The Division also organizes corporate sponsorships to provide fellowships for PhD students and undergraduates. It also organizes the Graduate Research Symposium and manages award and travel grant programs for undergraduates.

=== Local sections ===
Local sections were authorized in 1890 and are autonomous units of the American Chemical Society. They elect their own officers and select representatives to the national ACS organization. Local sections also provide professional development opportunities for members, organize community outreach events, offer awards, and conduct other business. The Rhode Island Section was the first local section of ACS, organized in 1891. There are currently 186 local sections of the American Chemical Society in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

=== International Chemical Sciences Chapters ===
International Chemical Sciences Chapters allow ACS members outside of the U.S. to organize locally for professional and scientific exchange. There are currently 24 International Chemical Sciences Chapters.
* Australia
* Brazil
* China
* Colombia
* Georgia
* Hong Kong
* Hungary
* India
* Iraq
* Jordan
* Malaysia
* Nigeria
* Pakistan
* Peru
* Qatar
* Republic of China (Taiwan)
* Romania
* Saudi Arabia
* Shanghai
* South Africa

== Educational activities and programs ==

=== Chemical education and outreach ===
ACS states that it offers teacher training to support the professional development of science teachers so they can better present chemistry in the classroom, foster the scientific curiosity of our nation&#x27;s youth and encourage future generations to pursue scientific careers. As of 2009, Clifford and Kathryn Hach donated $33 million to ACS, to continue the work of the Hach Scientific Foundation in supporting high school chemistry teaching.

The Society sponsors the United States National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO), a contest used to select the four-member team that represents the United States at the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO).

The ACS Division of Chemical Education provides standardized tests for various subfields of chemistry. The two most commonly used tests are the undergraduate-level tests for general and organic chemistry. Each of these tests consists of 70 multiple-choice questions, and gives students 110 minutes to complete the exam.

The ACS also approves certified undergraduate programs in chemistry. A student who completes the required laboratory and course work—sometimes in excess of what a particular college may require for its Bachelor&#x27;s degree—is considered by the Society to be well trained for professional work.

The ACS coordinates two annual public awareness campaigns, National Chemistry Week and Chemists Celebrate Earth Week, as part of its educational outreach. Since 1978 and 2003 respectively, the campaigns have been celebrated with a yearly theme, such as &quot;Chemistry Colors Our World&quot; (2015) and &quot;Energy: Now and Forever!&quot; (2013).

=== Green Chemistry Institute ===
The Green Chemistry Institute (GCI) supports the &quot;implementation of green chemistry and engineering throughout the global chemistry enterprise.&quot; The GCI organizes an annual conference, the Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference, provides research grants, administers awards, and provides information and support for green chemistry practices to educators, researchers, and industry.

The GCI was founded in 1997 as an independent non-profit organization, by chemists Joe Breen and Dennis Hjeresen in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2001, the GCI became a part of the American Chemical Society.

=== Petroleum Research Fund ===
The Petroleum Research Fund (PRF) is an endowment fund administered by the ACS that supports advanced education and fundamental research in the petroleum and fossil fuel fields at non-profit institutions. Several categories of grants are offered for various career levels and institutions. The fund awarded more than $25 million in grants in 2007.

The PRF traces its origins to the acquisition of the Universal Oil Products laboratory by a consortium of oil companies in 1931. The companies established a trust fund, The Petroleum Research Fund, in 1944 to prevent antitrust litigation tied to their UOP assets. The ACS was named the beneficiary of the trust. The first grants from the PRF were awarded in 1954. In 2000, the trust was transferred to the ACS. The ACS established The American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund and the previous trust was dissolved. The PRF trust was valued at $144.7 million in December 2014.

=== Other programs ===
The ACS International Activities is the birthplace of the ACS International Center, an online resource for scientists and engineers looking to study abroad or explore an international career or internship. The site houses information on hundreds of scholarships and grants related to all levels of experience to promote scientific mobility of researchers and practitioners in STEM fields.

The Society grants membership to undergraduates as student members provided they can pay the $25 yearly dues. Any university may start its own ACS Student Chapter and receive benefits of undergraduate participation in regional conferences and discounts on ACS publications.

== Awards ==
=== National awards ===

The American Chemical Society administers 64 national awards, medals and prizes based on scientific contributions at various career levels that promote achievement across the chemical sciences. The ACS national awards program began in 1922 with the establishment of the Priestley Medal, the highest award offered by the ACS, which is given for distinguished services to chemistry. The 2019 recipient of the Priestley Medal is K. Barry Sharpless.

=== Other awards ===
Additional awards are offered by divisions, local sections and other bodies of ACS. The William H. Nichols Medal Award was the first ACS award to honor outstanding researchers in the field of chemistry. It was established in 1903 by the ACS New York Section and is named for William H. Nichols, an American chemist and businessman and one of the original founders of ACS. Of the over 100 Nichols Medalists, 16 have subsequently been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The Willard Gibbs Award, granted by the ACS Chicago Section, was established in 1910 in honor of Josiah Willard Gibbs, the Yale University professor who formulated the phase rule.

The Georgia Local Section of ACS has awarded the Herty Medal since 1933 recognizing outstanding chemists who have significantly contributed to their chosen fields. All chemists in academic, government, or industrial laboratories who have been residing in the southeastern United States for at least 10 years are eligible.

The New York Section of ACS also gives Leadership Awards. The Leadership Awards are the highest honors given by the Chemical Marketing and Economic Group of ACS NY since December 6, 2012. They are presented to leaders of industry, investments, and other sectors, for their contributions to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) initiatives. Honorees include Andrew N. Liveris (Dow Chemical), P. Roy Vagelos (Regeneron, Merck), Thomas M. Connelly (DuPont) and Juan Pablo del Valle (Mexichem).

The ACS also administers regional awards presented annually at regional meetings. This includes the E. Ann Nalley Regional Award for Volunteer Service to the American Chemical Society, Regional Awards for Excellence in High School Teaching, and the Stanley C. Israel Regional Award for Advancing Diversity in the Chemical Sciences.

ACS also created ChemRxiv, which is an open access preprint repository for the chemical sciences, co-owned, and collaboratively managed by the American Chemical Society (ACS), German Chemical Society (GDCh), Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), the chemistry community, other societies, funders, and non-profits; open for submissions and available for all readers at ChemRxiv.

== Controversies ==

=== Open access ===
In debates about free access to scientific information, the ACS has been described as &quot;in an interesting dilemma, with some of its representatives pushing for open access and others hating the very thought.&quot; The ACS has generally opposed legislation that would mandate free access to scientific journal articles and chemical information. However it has recently launched new open access journals and provided authors with open access publishing options. Nevertheless, the actual percentage of open-access publications in ACS journals is the lowest among the 8 major scientific journal publishers (see figure below):

==== Journals ====
The mid-2000s saw a debate between some research funders (including the federal government), which argued that research they funded should be presented freely to the public, and some publishers (including the ACS), which argued that the costs of peer-review and publishing justified their subscription prices. In 2006, Congress debated legislation that would have instructed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to require all investigators it funded to submit copies of final, peer-reviewed journal articles to PubMed Central, a free-access digital repository it operates, within 12 months of publication. At the time the American Association of Publishers (of which ACS is a member) hired a public relations firm to counter the open access movement. In spite of publishers&#x27; opposition, the PubMed Central legislation was passed in December 2007 and became effective in 2008.

As the open access issue has continued to evolve, so too has the ACS&#x27;s position. In response to a 2013 White House Office of Science and Technology Policy directive that instructed federal agencies to provide greater access to federally funded research, the ACS joined other scholarly publishers in establishing the Clearinghouse for the Open Research of the United States (Chorus) to allow free access to published articles. The ACS has also introduced several open access publishing options for its journals, including providing authors the option to pay an upfront fee to enable free online access to their articles. In 2015, the ACS launched the first fully open access journal in the society&#x27;s history, &quot;ACS Central Science&quot;. The ACS states that the journal offers the same peer-review standards as its subscription journals, but without publishing charges to either authors or readers. A second open access title, &quot;ACS Omega&quot;, an interdisciplinary mega journal, launched in 2016. In December 2020, the ACS launched a series of 9 open access journals under the name &quot;ACS Au&quot; (chemical symbol for gold) which include
&quot;ACS Bio &amp; Med Chem Au&quot;,
&quot;ACS Engineering Au&quot;,
&quot;ACS Environmental Au&quot;,
&quot;ACS Materials Au&quot;,
&quot;ACS Measurement Science Au&quot;,
&quot;ACS Nanoscience Au&quot;,
&quot;ACS Organic &amp; Inorganic Au&quot;,
&quot;ACS Physical Chem Au&quot; and
&quot;ACS Polymers Au&quot;.

==== Databases ====
In 2005, the ACS was criticized for opposing the creation of PubChem, which is an open access chemical database developed by the NIH&#x27;s National Center for Biotechnology Information. The ACS raised concerns that the publicly supported PubChem database would duplicate and unfairly compete with their existing fee-based Chemical Abstracts Service and argued that the database should only present data created by the Molecular Libraries Screening Center initiative of the NIH.

The ACS lobbied members of the United States Congress to rein in PubChem and hired outside lobbying firms to try to persuade congressional members, the NIH, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) against establishing a publicly funded database. The ACS was unsuccessful, and as of 2012 PubChem is the world&#x27;s largest free chemical database.

The ACS is also the only provider of a major scientific publication database (SciFinder) that imposes a restriction on the number of records that can be exported. None of the competing products, such as Web of Science (owned by Clarivate), Scopus (owned by Elsevier) and The Lens (owned by Cambia) has similar restrictions.

=== Litigations ===
The ACS has been involved in numerous lawsuits regarding access to its databases, trademark rights, and copyrighted material. In many of these cases, the ACS lost or ended up with an unenforceable judgement. These include:

* &quot;Dialog&quot; &quot;v. American Chemical Society&quot;, a suit claiming antitrust violations in access to ACS databases, settled out of court in 1993;
*&quot;American Chemical Society v. Google&quot;, a suit claiming trademark violation, settled out of court in 2006;
*&quot;American Chemical Society v. Leadscope&quot;, a suit alleging stolen trade secrets, concluded in 2012 with ACS losing its trade secrets claim and Leadscope losing its counterclaim of defamation;
*A suit against ResearchGate, where a German court refused to award monetary compensation to the ACS and Elsevier;
*A suit against Sci-Hub, which resulted in a non-enforceable judgement.

The ACS was also found guilty in several lawsuits brought against the Society by its employees.

=== Executive compensation ===
In 2004, a group of ACS members criticized the compensation of former executive director and chief executive officer John Crum, whose total salary, expenses, and bonuses for 2002 was reported to be $767,834. The ACS defended the figure, saying that it was in line with that of comparable organizations, including for-profit publishers.

, two employees were reported to have a total compensation exceeding $900,000, while 694 had a compensation exceeding $100,000.

<text>The many-body problem is a general name for a vast category of physical problems pertaining to the properties of microscopic systems made of many interacting particles. 
==Terminology==

&quot;Microscopic&quot; here implies that quantum mechanics has to be used to provide an accurate description of the system. &quot;Many&quot; can be anywhere from three to infinity (in the case of a practically infinite, homogeneous or periodic system, such as a crystal), although three- and four-body systems can be treated by specific means (respectively the Faddeev and Faddeev–Yakubovsky equations) and are thus sometimes separately classified as few-body systems.
==Explanation of the problem==
In general terms, while the underlying physical laws that govern the motion of each individual particle may (or may not) be simple, the study of the collection of particles can be extremely complex. In such a quantum system, the repeated interactions between particles create quantum correlations, or entanglement. As a consequence, the wave function of the system is a complicated object holding a large amount of information, which usually makes exact or analytical calculations impractical or even impossible.

This becomes especially clear by a comparison to classical mechanics. Imagine a single particle that can be described with formula_1 numbers (take for example a free particle described by its position and velocity vector, resulting in formula_2). In classical mechanics, formula_3 such particles can simply be described by formula_4 numbers. The dimension of the classical many-body system scales linearly with the number of particles formula_5.

In quantum mechanics, however, the many-body-system is in general in a superposition of combinations of single particle states - all the formula_6 different combinations have to be accounted for. The dimension of the quantum many body system therefore scales exponentially with formula_5, much faster than in classical mechanics.

Because the required numerical expense grows so quickly, simulating the dynamics of more than three quantum-mechanical particles is already infeasible for many physical systems. Thus, many-body theoretical physics most often relies on a set of approximations specific to the problem at hand, and ranks among the most computationally intensive fields of science.

In many cases, emergent phenomena may arise which bear little resemblance to the underlying elementary laws.

Many-body problems play a central role in condensed matter physics.

<text>Matthew Dillon (born 1966) is an American software engineer known for Amiga software, contributions to FreeBSD and for starting and leading the DragonFly BSD project since 2003.

==Biography==
Dillon studied electronic engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, where he first became involved with BSD in 1985. He also became known for his Amiga programming, his C compiler DICE and his work on the Linux kernel. He founded and worked at Best Internet from 1994 until 1997, contributing to FreeBSD in that time. His &quot;Diablo&quot; internet news transit program was very popular with many ISPs.

In 1997, Dillon gained commit access to the FreeBSD code and heavily contributed to the virtual memory subsystem, amongst other contributions.

Concerned with problems he saw in the direction FreeBSD 5.x was headed in regards to concurrency, and coupled with the fact that Dillon&#x27;s access to the FreeBSD source code repository was revoked due to a falling-out with other FreeBSD developers, he started the DragonFly BSD project in 2003, implementing the SMP model using light-weight kernel threads. The DragonFly project also led to the development of a new userspace kernel virtualisation technique in 2006, called Virtual Kernel, originally to ease the development and testing of subsequent kernel-level features; a new file system, called HAMMER, which he created using B-trees; HAMMER was declared production-ready with DragonFly 2.2 in 2009; and, subsequently, HAMMER2, declared stable in 2018 with DragonFly 5.2.

Most recently, Dillon has gotten a number of headlines around CPU errata. In 2007, this was after Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD raised the alarm around the seriousness of some of the errata for Intel Core 2 family of CPUs. Dillon has independently evaluated Intel&#x27;s errata, and did an overview of Intel Core errata as well, suggesting that several of them were so serious as to warrant avoiding any processor where the issues remain unfixed. Dillon has since been a fan of AMD processors, and, subsequently in 2012, he has discovered a brand-new deficiency in some AMD processors for which no existing erratum existed at the time. Dillon continued his work around CPU issues as late as 2018, presenting solutions to tackle the latest security vulnerabilities like Meltdown, some of which have been subsequently adopted by OpenBSD as well.

Dillon was a frequent guest on bsdtalk during the runtime of the show, and was interviewed several times for KernelTrap.

<text>The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica)—also called the Atlantic oyster, American oyster, or East Coast oyster—is a species of true oyster native to eastern North and South America. Other names in local or culinary use include the [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts|Wellfleet]] oyster, [[Virginia]] oyster, [[Malpeque Bay|Malpeque]] oyster, [[Blue Point, New York|Blue Point]] oyster, [[Chesapeake Bay]] oyster, and [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]] oyster. &quot;C. virginica&quot; ranges from northern New Brunswick south through parts of the West Indies to Venezuela. It is farmed in all of the Maritime provinces of Canada and all Eastern Seaboard and Gulf states of the United States, as well as Puget Sound, Washington, where it is known as the Totten Inlet Virginica. It was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in the 19th century and is common in Pearl Harbor.

The eastern oyster is an important commercial species. Its distribution has been affected by habitat change; less than 1% of the population present when the first European colonists arrived is thought to remain in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. As of 2014, the global conservation status of &quot;Crassostrea virginica,&quot; as assessed by NatureServe, is &quot;vulnerable,&quot; as the oyster&#x27;s populations are threatened by overharvest and water pollution. Other threats to the eastern oyster include global warming, diseases and parasites, and competition with invasive species.

==Description==

Like all oysters, &quot;C. virginica&quot; is a bivalve mollusk with a hard calcium carbonaceous shell that protects it from predation.

This particular type of oyster is important to its ecosystem. Like all oysters, &quot;C. virginica&quot; is a filter feeder. It sucks in water and filters out the plankton and detritus to swallow, then spits the water back out, thus cleaning the water around it. One oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water in 24 hours. Eastern oysters also provide a key structural element within their ecosystem, making them a foundation species in many environments, and they serve as ecosystem engineers in western Atlantic estuaries. Like coral reefs, oyster beds, also known as oyster reefs, provide key habitat for a variety of different species by creating hard substrate for attachment and habitation. Oyster beds have an estimated 50 times the surface area of an equally sized flat bottom. The beds also attract a high concentration of larger predators looking for food.

The eastern oyster, like all members of the family Ostreidae, can make small pearls to surround particles that enter the shell. These pearls, however, are insignificant in size and of no monetary value; the pearl oyster, from which commercial pearls are harvested, is of a different family.

Unlike most bivalves, whose shells are aragonite, adult eastern oysters have calcite shells. The larvae, however, retain the aragonite shell of their ancestors. The specific gravity of the two types of shell is similar, so neither would confer a weight advantage over the other for a freely swimming larva. The transition to the thicker calcite shell in the adult of this species is thought to be an adaptation for defense against predators because the oysters are immobilized in exposed locations.

==Life cycle==

The life cycle of &quot;C. virginica&quot; consists of spawn, floating fertilized egg, trochophore, swimming straight-hinge veliger, swimming late veliger, swimming and crawling pediveliger, early spat, later spat, and adult oysters. Spawning of &quot;C. virginica&quot; is controlled by water temperatures and varies from north to south; northern oysters spawn at temperatures between , whereas southern oysters spawn at temperatures above . Spawning can occur throughout the warm months.

Eastern oysters can reach sexual maturity at four months old in southern waters. The eastern oyster&#x27;s reproductive cycle begins during late summer and autumn months with the storage of glycogen energy reserves. This glycogen is then used to support gametogenesis during the next winter and early spring when food intake is at a minimum. The gametes begin to mature in late spring and then, from June to August, they are spawned into the water column, where fertilization occurs. Each female produces from 75 to 150 million eggs, but only one in a thousand survives. Fertilized eggs develop in about six hours into planktonic, free-swimming, trochophore larvae, also known as the early umbo stage, which have cilia and a small shell. The trochophore larvae depend on their internal yolk supply for energy. They then develop within 12 to 24 hours into a fully shelled veliger larvae, also known as the late umbo stage, which has a hinged side and a velum. During this time, the shelled veliger larvae use their ciliated vela to capture food and swim. The larvae remain planktonic for about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on food and temperature conditions, and towards the end of this period, they develop into pediveliger larvae, also known as eyed larvae, which have an umbo, an eyespot, and a foot. During this time. the pediveliger larvae settle to the bottom, where they seek a hard substrate. Ideally, the pediveliger larvae try to locate an adult oyster shell to which they attach, often as part of an existing oyster reef, but other hard surfaces will suffice. Upon settling, a larva cements its left valve to the substrate and metamorphoses into an oyster spat by discarding its velum, reabsorbing its foot, and enlarging its gills. During the first year of life, &quot;C. virginica&quot; oysters are protandric. Most spat are male, but once they reach sexual maturity, some males change to females after the first or second spawning. Some females may change back to males again.

&quot;C. virginica&quot; has been used to study oxidative DNA damage caused by environmental heat stress. These studies indicated that heat shock driven oxidative stress induces increased oxidative damage in DNA (e.g. measured as 8-OHdG formation) and cellular apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the gills of American oysters.

==Regional histories==

===New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary===
===Chesapeake Bay===

====Before industrial harvesting====

Before Columbus and the rise of industrial oyster operations, oysters abounded in the bay. Oysters first arrived in the Chesapeake 5,000 years ago, and shortly after, local Indians began eating them. Archaeologists found evidence the local Native Americans returned to the same place to collect oysters for 3,000 years. John Smith, on a voyage up the Chesapeake, stated oysters &quot;lay as thick as stones.&quot; In fact, the word Chesapeake derives from an Algonquian word meaning &#x27;Great Shellfish Bay&#x27;. Because of the abundance of oysters filtering the waters of the Chesapeake, the water was much clearer than it is now. Visibility would sometimes reach 20 feet. When the English began settling the area, they evidently had a localized impact of the oyster population. One archaeological site measured oyster sizes near Maryland&#x27;s old capital St. Mary&#x27;s city from 1640 to 1710. In 1640, when the city was still small, oysters measured 80 mm, and in the city&#x27;s maximum population in 1690, they measured to 40 mm. When the capital moved to Annapolis, the population moved with it, and by 1710, the oysters were back up to 80 mm. However, the effect of overharvesting would remain local until after the Civil War, when a combination of new technologies led to the removal of nearly all the bay oysters.

====Industrial oyster harvesting====
During the industrial revolution, several new technologies were introduced to the Chesapeake Bay area which allowed for more intensive oyster harvesting. First was the invention of canning. This allowed oysters to be preserved much longer, and created demand for oysters across the world. Secondly, the invention of the dredge enabled oyster harvesters to reach untouched depths of the Chesapeake. And finally, the proliferation of steam-powered ships and railroads made transportation more reliable, enabling merchants to sell oysters far and wide. Estimates for the harvest in 1839 give a figure of 700,000 bushels. After the Civil War, dredges were legalized, and harvesting exploded to 5 million bushels that year. By 1875, 17 million bushels were taken from the bay. The harvesting would reach its peak in the 1880s, with 20 million bushels being harvested from the bay each year. Not only were they being taken for food, but also oyster reefs, where oysters had built hills of their dead shells over thousands of generations, were being dredged out. Surplus oyster shells had many uses then. They were ground into mortar, used as filler in roads, and as a source of lime in agricultural fertilizer. By the 1920s, harvests would be down to just 3–5 million bushels per year because of overharvesting.

====Decline and disease====

Overharvesting eventually depleted the remaining oyster population in the bay to just 1% of its historical level, where it stands today. Oyster harvests began to decline in the 1890s. They were being taken much faster than they could reproduce. Also, many of the shells and reefs were being taken and not being replaced. Oyster spat need a hard surface on which to attach, and these were vanishing because of the destruction of oyster reefs. By the 1920s, harvests were down to 3–5 million bushels per year, stabilized for a time by returning oyster shells back to the bay. But in the 1950s, the weakened oyster population had to deal with the diseases &quot;dermo&quot; and MSX. These decimated the remaining oyster population. The parasites which carried the disease are alien to eastern waters, and they were thought to have been brought to the Chesapeake by Asian oysters. Currently, oyster harvests average less than 200,000 bushels a year.

==Commercial value==
The eastern oyster used to be of great commercial value. Due to the steep decline in the number of oysters in various traditionally harvested areas, primarily because of overfishing and diseases, the annual catch has declined significantly. In Maryland, the 2006–2007 catch was 165,059 bushels (about 7600 m3) of oysters. Other regions of the East Coast of the United States have successful oyster farms, including most notably Cotuit, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Wellfleet, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod.

==Effects of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill==

Harvestable size of a &quot;C. virginica&quot; oyster is , which can take from 12 to 36 months, depending on temperature, salinity of the water, and food supply. Salinity is a very important climatological variable that affects spatfall. Oysters do best where salinities range from 10 to 30 ppt; the range of 15 to 18 ppt is considered optimal. Typically, when salinity levels are less than 6 ppt, larvae will not settle and metamorphose into spat. In 2010, 665 miles of coastline were affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. To keep the oil at bay and to spare the oystermen, the authorities of Louisiana made an unprecedented decision to maximize the fresh water flow through the region&#x27;s canals to three times usual levels. At the mouth of the canals, salinity fell to almost zero, which was probably why most of the oysters died. Sujata Gupta ventured into the marshlands and Gulf of Mexico with Brad Robin, a man from a line of generations of oystermen in southeastern Louisiana. Robin and his crew threw a net over the side to haul in a catch. There were dozens of palm-sized oysters, but 75% of them were &quot;boxes&quot; or empty shells. However, as they traveled further towards the Gulf of Mexico, where the water was less salinity-stressed by the flush, only 20% of the haul came back as boxes, a promising sign the oysters are trying to come back. Gupta reported, &quot;Now since there are so many empty shells scattered on the sea floor, the larvae have more to latch onto, improving their odds&quot;. However, salinity levels are not the only concern. Eastern oysters are filter feeders, so they are greatly affected by their surroundings since they are sessile organisms. This means if the water around them was contaminated with oil and the dispersant used to get rid of the oil, then these chemicals were collected by the oysters as they filtered the water. This is cause for great concern that the oysters are being killed by the toxins in the dispersant, as well. An added dilemma is oysters are in their weakest state after spawning season, which may have caused some of them to close their shells, resulting in death by suffocation within just a few days due to warm temperatures in the Gulf if the shells remain closed. The toxins in the oil and dispersants can also kill the larvae. To highlight the recovery of the state&#x27;s oyster industry, the shell of &quot;C. virginica&quot; cut into cabochons was made Louisiana&#x27;s official state gem in 2011.

==Diseases==
&quot;Dermo&quot; (&quot;Perkinsus marinus&quot;) is a marine disease of oysters, caused by a protozoan parasite. It is a prevalent pathogen of oysters, causing massive mortality in oyster populations, and poses a significant economic threat to the oyster industry.

Multinucleated sphere X (MSX) (&quot;Haplosporidium nelsoni&quot;), another protozoan, was first described along the mid-Atlantic coast in 1957. Mortalities can reach 90% to 95% of the oyster population within 2 to 3 years of being seeded. MSX slows the feeding rates of infected oysters, leading to a reduction in the amount of stored carbohydrates, which in turn inhibits normal gametogenesis during spawning, resulting in reduced fecundity.

==Recognition==

The eastern oyster is the state shellfish of Connecticut, its shell is the state shell of Virginia and Mississippi, and its shell in cabochon form is the state gem of Louisiana.

<text>Count Kasimir Felix Badeni (German: &quot;Kasimir Felix Graf von Badeni&quot;, Polish: &quot;Kazimierz Feliks hrabia Badeni&quot;; 14 October 1846 – 9 July 1909), a member of the Polish noble House of Badeni, was an Austrian statesman, who served as Minister-President of Cisleithania from 1895 until 1897.

Many people in Austria, especially Emperor Franz Joseph, had placed great hope in Badeni&#x27;s efforts to reform the electoral system and the language legislation in order to solve some fundamental problems of the multinational state, which eventually failed.

==Biography==
Kasimir Felix Badeni was born in Surochów near Jarosław (&quot;Jaroslau&quot;) in the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, the son of Count Ladislaus Badeni (1819–1888) and his wife, Countess Cäcilie von Mier (1825–1897). Badeni studied law at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków and joined the Austrian civil service in 1866, serving in the Ministry of the Interior and in the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1871 he was appointed district commissioner (&quot;Bezirkshauptmann&quot;) in Żółkiew, later in Rzeszów. From 1879 he worked as court councillor and delegate of the Galician stadtholder in Kraków.

Badeni retired to his country estates in 1866, nevertheless two years later he was appointed k.k. stadtholder of Galicia by Emperor Franz Joseph. During his tenure, he played a key role in the rapprochement between the Polish elite and the Ruthenians that came to be known as the &quot;New Era&quot;. He was devoted to the Habsburg Monarchy and the Emperor as a firm conservative, which combined with his successes in Galicia impressed Franz Joseph.

On 21 October 1871, he married Maria von Skrzynsky (1850–1937), the only daughter of Ludwig, Ritter von Skrzynsky and his wife, Severyne Fredro. Their son, Count Ludwik Józef Władysław Badeni (1873–1916), a diplomat working at the Austro-Hungarian legation in Stockholm, was married to Alice Elisabeth Ankarcrona (1889–1985), a daughter of the Swedish noble Oscar Carl Gustav Ankarcrona. After Badeni&#x27;s death, Alice secondly married Archduke Karl Albrecht of Austria. They also had a daughter, Countess Wanda Badeni (1874–1950), who married firstly to Count Adam Krasiński (d. 1909) and secondly to Count Sigismund Zamoyski (1875–1931).

==Presidency==
Badeni came to power in Austria after the failure of Minister-President Alfred III zu Windisch-Grätz&#x27;s coalition ministry of conservative and liberals. Keenly aware of the growing tensions within the Empire due to ethnic rivalries and the political agitation of socialists and nationalists, Badeni expressed doubt as to the ability of Austria-Hungary to wage war effectively. He claimed &quot;a state of nationalities cannot wage war without danger to itself.&quot;

===Electoral reform===
In 1896 he succeeded in implementing a form of universal male suffrage but made it palatable to the ruling interests of the Empire. To the previous four classes of voters, which depended on the amount of taxes each individual paid, his reform added a fifth class to include every adult male below the five-guilder threshold set for the fourth class in the 1882 Taaffe reform.

The electoral reform had far-reaching effects: the newly established fifth class encompassed 72 of the 425 seats in the lower house of the Imperial Council (&quot;Reichsrat&quot;) and most mandates went to the Social Democrats, the populist Christian Social Party, and also to German nationalists. In a short time, the Imperial Council developed from an Assembly of Notables to a gathering of definitive parliamentary groups with a strong party discipline.

===Language conflict===

Badeni courted controversy when, in an attempt to gain the support of the Young Czech faction in the Reichsrat, he addressed the language issue in Bohemia. His ordinance of 5 April 1897 declared &quot;that Czech and German should be the languages of the &#x27;inner service&#x27; throughout Bohemia.&quot; This meant that civil servants in the province would have to know both Czech and German, since government business would be conducted in both languages for internal Bohemian affairs. Germans in Bohemia were outraged, since this effectively excluded the majority of them from government jobs; Czechs learned German in school, but Germans had usually little to no knowledge of the Czech language.

Late-19th-century Germans in Austria-Hungary, as a general rule, wanted the Empire to maintain its German character established during the period of Germanization under Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor in the late 18th century, so they resisted the demands of the other ethnic groups for linguistic recognition. Badeni&#x27;s ordinance was seen by Germans as the &quot;last straw&quot; in a series of concessions. Badeni was not prepared for the level of animosity the Germans in Bohemia and elsewhere in the Empire directed at him due to his reform.

The fringe German Nationalist Party, headed by Georg Schönerer, hoping to destabilize the Empire and join the German lands of Austria to the new German Empire, disrupted parliamentary proceedings and instigated violent protests. Although most Germans of Austria had no sympathy for the Nationalist Party&#x27;s cause, they participated in street protests across the Austro-Hungarian Empire, hoping to have the ordinance repealed. Obstructionism by German nationalists slowed or stopped parliamentary business in the Reichsrat and riots erupted in Vienna, Graz, Salzburg, and the Alpine provinces. Riots took place also in Prague and martial law was put into effect there.

===Resignation===
Amidst this political turmoil, in November 1897, Emperor Franz Joseph, frightened by the mass agitation of some of the most important segments of society, dismissed Badeni. His fall, however, did not end the political and ethnic problems within the Empire and for several years, while the Reichsrat met occasionally, the government ruled largely through emergency decree. Badeni&#x27;s language ordinances were repealed in 1899, disappointing Czechs and failing to appease German nationalists.

Some commentators of the time felt, that Badeni was unaccustomed to the political dynamics of the more-industrialized western part of the Empire; he was used to the provincial social relations of Galicia, where he was a landowner. That was given as an explanation for Badeni&#x27;s political blunder. In fact Badeni believed that the Czechs were growing as a nation and their national ambitions would sooner or later have to be accommodated within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as the ambitions of the Hungarians had been decades previously. Badeni was one of the few politicians who saw that without rapprochement between different nations within the Austro-Hungarian state, the Empire would fall apart.

<doc id="428522" wikidata="Q64601" url="?curid=428522" title="Scorewriter">
<text>A scorewriter, or music notation program is software for creating, editing and printing sheet music. A scorewriter is to music notation what a word processor is to text, in that they typically provide flexible editing and automatic layout, and produce high-quality printed results.

The first modern score manipulation program was Mockingbird, written by John Maxwell and Severo Ornstein at Xerox PARC in 1980 on a Dorado computer. It preceded MIDI so an electronic keyboard had to be modified to enable interaction (input and playback) with the program. The WYSIWYG program was envisioned as a composer&#x27;s amanuensis, but as it was an experimental program it never reached beyond PARC, though it influenced commercial programs which soon followed.

Most scorewriters, especially those from the 2000s, can record notes played on a MIDI keyboard (or other MIDI instruments), and play music back via MIDI or virtual instruments. Playback is especially useful for novice composers and music students, and when musicians are not available or affordable. Several free programs are widely used, such as MuseScore. The three main professional-level programs are Finale, Sibelius and Dorico.

==Comparison with multitrack sequencer software==
Multitrack sequencer software and scorewriters typically employ different methods for notation input and display.

Scorewriters are based on traditional music notation, using staff lines and round note heads, which originates from European classical music. They use symbols representing durations in sound and silence, dynamics, articulations and tempo. Some also allow users to import and/or create their own symbols. Multitrack sequencer software typically uses a multitrack recorder metaphor as the main interface, with multiple tracks and track segments. Individual tracks can be edited using graphic notation in the form of a &quot;piano roll&quot;-guided input for the control of MIDI-based hardware and software instruments.

A third approach has also emerged that combines the first two input methods into a digital audio workstation, allowing users to score parts using traditional notation, the graphic notation of the piano roll, and recording acoustic or electronic instruments in real time alongside the existing scores. With all three methods, the computer keyboard, mouse, and a MIDI musical keyboard can be used to enter music that can then be edited with traditional or piano-roll-based notation.

==History==
The rapid growth of desktop computers in the 1980s saw the creation of dozens of early scorewriters (see list of scorewriters). They were a boon to young composers, music educators and composition students, providing a much less expensive way to create scores and parts for orchestral music and other works. However, they were hard to use; and while scores were readable, they did not look like professionally engraved scores or parts. An exception was SCORE notation software. Developed in the late &#x27;80s, it was used mostly by commercial publishers, as its price put it out of the reach of most non-professional composers/copyists. During the 1990s, many of these early programs, such as the Mosaic notation program, fell into disuse, as newer programs surpassed them in ease of use and output quality. Finale and Sibelius were released, with high-quality output and a wide range of sophisticated features that made them suitable for almost all kinds of music applications.

By 2000, the market was dominated by Finale (particularly in the US) and Sibelius (which had dominated the UK since 1993, and expanded worldwide after its Windows release in 1998). Inexpensive programs such as capella gained a significant share of the market in some countries. Sibelius and Finale still dominated the market as of 2012.

In 2006, Sibelius was purchased by Avid. In a 2012 restructuring, Sibelius&#x27;s London office was closed and the development team dismissed. In February 2013, Steinberg announced it had hired the former Sibelius team to create a new scorewriter, Dorico, which was released in October 2016. The trio of Finale, Sibelius and Dorico are today&#x27;s leading professional-level programs.

==Functionality==

All scorewriters allow the user to input, edit and print music notation to varying degrees of sophistication. They range from programs which can write a simple song, piano piece or guitar tab, to those that can handle the complexities of orchestral music, specialist notations (from early music to avant-garde), and high-quality music engraving.

Music can usually be input using the mouse, computer keyboard, or a MIDI keyboard. A few allow input by scanning scores using musical OCR; by playing or singing into a microphone; or by using a touch screen.

Most scorewriters also allow users to play the music back, using MIDI or virtual instruments such as VST instruments. The screen can show at one time both the score and, by changing the colour of keys on a virtual piano&#x27;s keyboard, the notes being played. Although sequencers can also write some musical notation, they are primarily for recording and playing music. Scorewriters can typically write more complex and sophisticated notation than sequencers can.

Some scorewriters allow users to customize and fine-tune the printed output to a considerable degree, as is required by publishers to produce high-quality music engraving and to suit their individual house style.

A few scorewriters allow users to publish scores on the Internet, where they can be (for example) played back, transposed, and printed out, perhaps for a fee.

Most scorewriters provide other musical functions such as transposing; producing separate instrumental parts from a full score; or applying musical transformations such as retrograde. Some can automatically create instrumental exercises and student worksheets. Some support plug-ins, often developed by users or other companies. Other features may include version control, change tracking, graphics import and export, Post-It-like sticky notes, etc.

==File formats==
Almost all scorewriters use their own file formats for saving files. Hence, in order to move notation between different scorewriters (or to/from other kinds of music software such as sequencers), most scorewriters can also import or export one or more standard interchange file formats, such as:

*Standard MIDI File is supported by almost all scorewriters. However, as this format was designed for playback (e.g. by sequencers) rather than notation, it only produces approximate results and much notational information is lost in the process. If the score is to be presented, a WAV file (rather than MIDI) may be made from the score to give a more natural and accurate rendition of the written score.
*MusicXML has in recent years (as of 2012) become the standard interchange format for accurate notation.
*Notation Interchange File Format (NIFF) is a now-obsolete file format that was supported by a few scorewriters.

This Comparison of scorewriters details which score writers can import and export to PDF, text (ASCII), picture (PNG, SVG, EMF) and sound (Vorbis OGG) file formats.

There are also human-readable text-based formats such as ABC notation, LilyPond, ASCII tab and NoteWorthy Composer text files. These are easily rendered as speech by screen reading software. The to MediaWiki can render, and generate an audio preview of, the first two formats.

<text>Huang Xing or Huang Hsing (; 25 October 1874 – 31 October 1916) was a Chinese revolutionary leader and politician, and the first commander-in-chief of the Republic of China. As one of the founders of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Republic of China, his position was second only to Sun Yat-sen. Together they were known as Sun-Huang during the Xinhai Revolution. He was also known as the &quot;Eight Fingered General&quot; because of wounds sustained during war. His tomb is on Mount Yuelu, in Changsha, Hunan, China.

Huang was born in the village of Gaotang, now part of Changsha, Hunan. Like many other Chinese men born before 1949, Huang was known by many different names during his life. His birth name was &quot;Huang Zhen&quot;, but this was later changed to &quot;Huang Xing&quot;. He was also known as &quot;Huang Keqiang&quot; and &quot;Qing Wu&quot;. In the period after 1911 he also used the names &quot;Li Youqing&quot; and &quot;Zhang Shouzheng&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Huang Xing was a descendant of Huang Tingjian, a Chinese artist, scholar, government official, and poet of the Song dynasty. Huang Xing began his studies at the prestigious South Changsha Academy in 1893, and received his Jinshi degree when he was only 22 years old. In 1898 Huang Xing was selected to complete further study at Wuchang Lianghu College, from which Huang Xing graduated in 1901. In 1902 Huang was selected by Zhang Zhidong to study abroad in Japan, and was enrolled in Tokyo&#x27;s Kōbun Institute (弘文学院).

While in Japan, Huang Xing developed an appreciation for the study of military affairs, and studied modern warfare under a Japanese officer in his leisure time. While living in Japan, Huang Xing practiced horsemanship and shooting every morning. Huang Xing&#x27;s military training in Japan prepared him for his later role as a Chinese revolutionary.

===Taking up the sword===
In 1903, Huang organized the Anti-Russia Volunteer Army () of over two hundred fellow students in Japan. The Army, quickly shut down by authorities in Japan, was intended to protest Russia&#x27;s growing hegemony over Outer Mongolia and its occupation of northeast China after the Boxer Uprising. Later in 1903 Huang returned to China and organized a meeting with Chen Tianhua, Song Jiaoren, and more than 20 other people. The group founded the Huaxinghui, a secret revolutionary party dedicated to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. Huang Xing was elected president.

The Huaxinghui cooperated with other revolutionary parties, and in 1905 scheduled an armed uprising in Changsha during the Empress Dowager&#x27;s seventieth birthday celebration. The Huaxinghui&#x27;s plan was discovered, and its members (including Huang) were forced to escape to Japan. In Japan, Huang met Sun Yat-sen and helped Sun found the Tongmenghui, another revolutionary party dedicated to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. Huang held the post of General Affairs Officer, and became the Tongmenghui&#x27;s second most important leader, after Sun. Following the founding of the Tongmenghui, Huang devoted his time and energy to the revolution.

===Attempted uprisings===
In 1907 Huang secretly returned to China and traveled to Hanoi in French Indochina in order to participate in numerous revolts, including the Qinzhou Uprising, Fangcheng Uprising, and Zhen Nanguan Uprising. All of the revolts that Huang actively took part in failed due to lack of sufficient resources. In the autumn of 1909, Huang was commissioned by Sun Yat-sen to establish the South Branch of the Tongmenghui, and to prepare the Party for a planned military uprising from Guangzhou. In the spring of 1909, Huang led another uprising, but this revolt also failed. In October 1909, Huang presided over an assembly with Sun Yat-sen in the British colony of Penang (now part of Malaysia). The assembly decided to concentrate human and financial resources to stage further uprisings in Guangzhou.

In the spring of 1911, Huang established the Department of the Guangzhou Uprising in Hong Kong, and became the Department&#x27;s minister. On April 27, Huang launched the Huanghuagang Uprising in Guangzhou, and led hundreds of people in an attempt to capture the viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi. Huang and his followers failed to capture the viceroy, who climbed over a wall in order to escape them. During the skirmish, Huang sustained serious injuries and sustained a gunshot wound to his hand, resulting in losing two of his fingers. The Huanghuagang Uprising turned out to be the last unsuccessful revolt before the Wuchang Uprising, that ultimately succeeded in overthrowing the Qing Dynasty by the end of 1911.

Following the Wuchang Uprising in October 1911, Huang Xing traveled from Shanghai to Wuchang and commanded the revolutionary forces in the Battle of Yangxia against Qing loyalist forces of Yuan Shikai.

===Opposing Yuan Shikai===
On January 1, 1912, the Nanjing Interim Government was established, and Huang was selected to be one of its leaders. In August 1912, Huang became the director of the KMT. In March 1913, the provisional president of the newly formed Republic of China, Yuan Shikai, successfully assassinated the chairman of the KMT, Song Jiaoren, whose party had won China&#x27;s first elections and who had shown indications of a desire to limit Yuan&#x27;s powers within the new government.

In later 1913, Yuan Shikai expelled KMT members from all government offices and moved the government to Beijing. Huang stayed in Nanjing and attempted to reorganize the South Army in order to oppose Yuan. Because of a shortage of money, Huang&#x27;s army later mutinied, and Huang had to abandon Nanjing and retreat to the foreign concession areas of Shanghai. Sun Yat-sen again fled to Japan in November 1913.

In July 1913, Sun organized armed forces to suppress Yuan, and the Second Revolution broke out. On July 14, Huang went to Nanjing from Shanghai, convinced the military governor of Jiangsu to declare independence from Yuan, and pushed to be the military commander in charge suppressing Yuan&#x27;s forces in Jiangsu. After Huang&#x27;s rebellion in Jiangsu failed, Huang fled back to Japan.

===Final years===
Huang went into exile in the United States in 1914, and Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor in 1915. While abroad, Huang raised funds in order to raise a Yunnan National Protection Army to suppress Yuan. After the death of Yuan, in June 1916, Huang returned to China. In October 1916, Huang died in Shanghai at the age of 42 of cirrhosis. On April 15, 1917, Huang was given a state funeral, and was buried in Changsha on Yuelu Mountain.

<text>William John Hartack Jr. (December 9, 1932 – November 26, 2007) was an American jockey.

==Early life and career==
Referred to by the media as both &quot;Bill&quot; and &quot;Willie&quot; (Hartack detested being called &quot;Willie&quot;) during his racing career, Hartack grew up on a farm in the Blacklick Township area of Cambria County, Pennsylvania.

His mother died from injuries in an automobile accident in 1940, when Hartack was 8.

Small in stature, at age 17 he stood 5 ft. 4 in. (1.63 m) and weighed 111 lb (50 kg), a size that enabled him to pursue a career as a jockey in Thoroughbred horse racing.

By his third season of racing, Hartack was the United States&#x27; leading jockey in both wins and money earned. He would go on to win a National Champion title six times. 

He and Eddie Arcaro are the only two jockeys to ever win the Kentucky Derby five times. As well, Hartack won the Preakness Stakes three times and the Belmont Stakes once. He rode Tim Tam to victory in the 1958 Florida Derby but a week before the Kentucky Derby, Hartack broke a leg and had to give up his ride on Tim Tam to replacement jockey Ismael Valenzuela, who won the Derby.

During his riding career between 1953 and 1974 in the United States, Hartack rode 4,272 winners in 21,535 mounts. From 1974 to 1980 he raced in Hong Kong, then retired in 1981. Hartack led the nation in races won four times, and was the first rider to have purse earnings of $3 million in a season.

After he retired as a jockey, Hartack worked as a steward as well as other racing officials for the rest of his life.

Hartack made the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine in 1956 and again in 1964, plus the cover of the 10 February 1958 issue of &quot;Time&quot;, which he always refused to sign as it showed his first name as &quot;Willie,&quot; which he detested.

He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1959 at the early age of 26.

In 1967, Hartack authored (with Whitney Tower) a three-part series in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; titled &quot;A Hard Ride All The Way.&quot; Published in the March 27, April 3 &amp; April 10 issues, the series chronicled Hartack&#x27;s life and included his frequent run-ins and disputes with owners, trainers, racing officials and members of the press.

Winners ridden in Triple Crown Classic races :

* Kentucky Derby:
:1957 : Iron Liege 
:1960 : Venetian Way 
:1962 : Decidedly 
:1964 : Northern Dancer 
:1969 : Majestic Prince 
* Preakness Stakes:
:1956 : Fabius
:1964 : Northern Dancer 
:1969 : Majestic Prince 
* Belmont Stakes:
:1960 : Celtic Ash

==Death==
On November 26, 2007, two weeks before what would have been his 75th birthday, Hartack was found dead from an apparent heart attack in a cabin at a camp near the town of Freer, Texas while on a hunting vacation.

==Legacy==
The Bill Hartack Charitable Foundation was established to honor a racing legend and icon and to continue in his name contributions to the industry he dearly loved - Thoroughbred racing. More information can be found at billhartackfoundation.com.

<doc id="428535" wikidata="Q1549267" url="?curid=428535" title="Moor's head">
<text>A Moor&#x27;s head, also known as a Maure, since the 11th century, is a symbol depicting the head of a black moor. The term moor came to define anyone who was African and Muslim.

==Origin==
The precise origin of the Moor&#x27;s head as a heraldic symbol is a subject of controversy. The most likely explanation is that it is derived from the heraldic war flag of the Reconquista depicting the Cross of Alcoraz, symbolizing Peter I of Aragon and Pamplona&#x27;s victory over the &quot;Moorish&quot; kings of the Taifa of Zaragoza in the Battle of Alcoraz in 1096. The headband may originally have been a blindfold. Another theory claims that it represents the Nubian Saint Maurice (3rd century AD).

The earliest heraldic use of the Moor&#x27;s head is first recorded in 1281, during the reign of Peter III of Aragon and represents the Cross of Alcoraz, which the King adopted as his personal coat of arms. The Crown of Aragon had for a long time governed Sardinia and Corsica, having been granted the islands by the Pope, although they never really exercised formal control. The Moor&#x27;s head became a symbol of the islands.

== Flags, seals, and emblems ==
This symbol is used in heraldry, vexillography, and political imagery.

=== Flag of Corsica ===
The main charge in the coat of arms in Corsica is a &quot;&quot;, Corsican for &quot;The Moor&quot;. An early version is attested in the 14th-century Gelre Armorial, where an unblindfolded Moor&#x27;s head represents Corsica as a territory of the Crown of Aragon. Interestingly, the Moor&#x27;s head is attached to his shoulders and upper body, and he is alive and smiling. In 1736, it was used by both sides during the struggle for independence.

In 1760, General Pasquale Paoli ordered the necklace to be removed from the head and the blindfold raised. His reason, reported by his biographers, was &quot;&quot; () The blindfold was thereafter changed to a headband.

The current flag of Corsica is the , is male rather than female, and has a regular knot at the back of the head.

==== SC Bastia ====
The Moor&#x27;s head appears on the logo for the Corsican football team SC Bastia, who play in the French football system&#x27;s Ligue 2.

=== Flag of Sardinia ===
The flag of Sardinia is informally known as &quot;the Four Moors&quot; (, , ) and comprises four Moor heads.

=== African Unification Front ===
The &quot;Maure&quot; is the African Unification Front&#x27;s flag and emblem. The head is blindfolded representing the impartiality of justice, and the knot is tied into a stylized Adinkra symbol for omnipotence (Gye Nyame).

==Modern controversy==

Critics in Switzerland have characterized the use of the Moor&#x27;s head as racist, when used as a symbol by a workers guild. 

In 2012, activists requested the brewing company Mohrenbrauerei to remove the &quot;Moor&#x27;s head&quot; from its bottles; the company declined, saying the design was part of heraldry used by the family who started the brewery.

<doc id="428542" wikidata="Q1062211" url="?curid=428542" title="Parallel voting">
<text>In political science, parallel voting or superposition refers to the use of two or more electoral systems to elect different members of a legislature. More precisely, an electoral system is a superposition if it is a mixture of at least two tiers, which do not interact with each other in any way; one part of a legislature is elected using one method, while another part is elected using a different method, with all voters participating in both. Thus, the final results can be found by calculating the results for each system separately based on the votes alone, then adding them together. A system is called fusion (not to be confused with electoral fusion) or majority bonus, another independent mixture of two system but without two tiers. Superposition (parallel voting) is also not the same as &quot;coexistence&quot;, which when different districts in the same election use different systems. Superposition, fusion and coexistence are distinct from dependent mixed electoral systems like compensatory (corrective) and conditional systems. 

Most often, parallel voting involves combining a winner-take-all system with party-list proportional representation (PR). While first-preference plurality with PR is the most common pairing in parallel voting, many other combinations are possible. 

The proportion of list seats compared to total seats ranges widely; for example 30% in Taiwan, 37.5% in Japan and 68.7% in Armenia. Parallel voting is used in both national parliaments and local governments in Italy, Taiwan, Lithuania, Russia, Argentina, and other countries, making it among the world&#x27;s most popular electoral systems.

== Definition ==
In parallel voting, voters cast two (or more) votes, one for each method the system contains. However, these votes do not interact in any way: the vote in one method has no effect on the calculation of seats in the other methods.

=== Confusion and conflation ===
Under the most common form of parallel voting, a portion of seats in the legislature are filled by the single-member first-preference plurality method (FPP), while others are filled by proportional representation. This sometimes leads to a hypercorrection that attempts to limit the term parallel voting to refer only to mixtures of first-past-the-post and proportional representation. Parallel voting can use other systems besides FPP, and can have any mixture of winner-take-all, semi-proportional, and proportional components.

Although the two are often mistakenly conflated, mixed-member majoritarian representation and parallel voting refer to two different things. Parallel voting refers to a &quot;rule&quot; for computing each party&#x27;s representation in a legislature, which involves two voting systems operating in parallel, with one being layered (superimposed) on top of the other. By contrast, mixed-member majoritarian representation refers to the &quot;results&quot; of the system, i.e. the system retains the advantage that some parties parties get in the winner-take-all side of the system.

For this reason, parallel voting is not always mixed-member majoritarian. For example, parallel voting may use a two proportional systems like STV and list-PR and then it would not be mixed-member majoritarian, and a majority bonus system (which is not the same as parallel voting) may also be considered mixed majoritarian. In addition, some mixed-member majoritarian systems are not parallel, in that they allow for interaction (limited compensation) between the two components, for example this is the case in South Korea and Mexico. In South Korea, the hybrid of parallel voting and seat linkage compensation, being between the MMP and MMM type of representation has been called mixed-member semi-proportional representation as well.

Unlike mixed-member proportional representation, where party lists are used to achieve an overall proportional result in the legislature, under parallel voting, proportionality is confined only to the list seats. Therefore, a party that secured, say, 5% of the vote will have only 5% of the &quot;list&quot; seats, and not 5% of all the seats in the legislature.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
=== Representation for smaller parties ===
The major critique of parallel systems is that they cannot guarantee overall proportionality. Large parties can win very large majorities, disproportionate to their percentage vote.

Parallel voting systems allow smaller parties that cannot win individual elections to secure at least some representation in the legislature; however, unlike in a proportional system they will have a substantially smaller delegation than their share of the total vote. This is seen by advocates of proportional systems to be better than elections using only first-past-the-post, but still unfair towards constituents of smaller parties. If there is also a threshold for list seats, parties which are too small to reach the threshold are unable to achieve any representation, unless they have a very strong base in certain constituencies to gain individual seats. 

Smaller parties are still disadvantaged as the larger parties still predominate. Voters of smaller parties may tactically vote for candidates of larger parties to avoid wasting their constituency vote. If the smaller party close to the threshold may refrain from voting for their preferred party in favour of a larger party to avoid wasting their list vote as well. In countries where there is one dominant party and a divided opposition, the proportional seats may be essential for allowing an effective opposition.

Those who favour majoritarian systems argue that supplementary seats allocated proportionally increases the chances that no party will receive a majority in an assembly, leading to minority or coalition governments.; the largest parties may need to rely on the support of smaller ones in order to form a government. Those who favour proportional representation see this as an advantage as parties may not govern alone, but have to compromise. It is also argued that parallel voting does not lead to the degree of fragmentation found in party systems under pure forms of proportional representation.

=== Two types of representatives ===
Because voters have two votes, one for a constituency candidate and one for a list, there is a critique that two classes of representatives will emerge under a parallel voting system: with one class beholden to their electorate seat, and the other concerned only with their party. Some consider this as an advantage as local as well as national interests will be represented. Some prefer systems where every constituency and therefore every constituent has only one representative, while others prefer a system where every MP represents the electorate as a whole as this is reflected in the electoral system as well.

=== Compared to MMP and AMS ===
Parallel systems are often contrasted with mixed-member proportional systems (MMP) or the additional member system (AMS). There are a unique set of advantages and disadvantages that apply to these specific comparisons.

A party that can gerrymander local districts can win more than its share of seats. So parallel systems need fair criteria to draw district boundaries. (Under MMP a gerrymander can help a local candidate, but it cannot raise a major party’s share of seats, while under AMS the effects of gerrymandering are reduced by the compensation)

Japan, and subsequently Thailand and Russia adopted a parallel system to provide incentives for greater party cohesiveness. The party is sure to elect the candidates at the top of its list, guaranteeing safe seats for the leadership. By contrast, under the MMP or AMS system a party that does well in the local seats will not need or receive any compensatory list seats, so the leadership might have to run in the local seats.

Certain types of AMS can be made &quot;de facto&quot; parallel systems by tactical voting and parties using decoy lists, which (other) MMP systems generally avoid. This specific type of tactical voting does not occur in parallel voting systems as there is no interaction between its systems to exploit in a way that makes it irrelevant. However, other types of tactical voting (such as compromising) are more relevant under parallel voting, than under AMS, and are virtually irrelevant under MMP. Tactical voting by supporters of larger parties in favour of allied smaller parties close to a threshold, to help their entry to parliament are a possibility in any parallel, AMS or MMP system with an electoral threshold.

Parallel systems support the creation of single-party majorities more often than MMP or AMS systems, this may be a positive or a negative depending on the view of the voter.

== Use ==
===Current use===
Parallel voting is currently used in the following countries:
==== Philippines ====
The Philippines&#x27; electoral system for Congress is an exceptional case. Political parties running for party-list seats are legally required to be completely separate from those running in constituency seats. Furthermore, political parties are capped at 3 seats (out of 61). As a result, the mixed-member system utilized in the Philippines is not representative at all of the share of the vote that &quot;normal&quot; political parties obtain (even amongst mixed-member majoritarian systems), let alone for those in full proportional representation systems.

=== Hybrid use and similar systems ===

* Hungary&#x27;s National Assembly uses a system where the parallel voting component shares a pool of seats (93) with the vote transfer system and with the minority list seats with a reduced entry threshold. This means the number of seats effectively assigned proportionally based on the parallel party list votes is unknown/unknowable before the election takes place.
* Italy: Starting with the 2018 election, both houses of the Italian parliament are elected using a system similar to parallel voting. 62.5% of the seats are assigned proportionally to party lists; party lists are also linked in coalitions supporting constituency candidates running for the remaining 37.5% of the available seats, who are elected by means of a first-past-the-post system. Electors have a single vote with two-fold effects for a party list (proportional) and its associated local candidate (majoritarian). Split-ticket voting is not allowed, a voter may mark their ballots only next to a list, a candidate, or a list and a candidate associated with it and all of these votes has the same effect. If a voter marks a candidate not associated with the list they marked, like voters may under parallel voting, the vote is invalid under the Italian system.
* Jersey (UK)
* Monaco
* Mexico: In contrast to the parallel voting system for the Chamber of Deputies, for electing the Chamber of Senators (upper house), a single (party list) vote is used similarly to the Italian system. However, constituencies have 3 seats with a type of limited (party block) voting being used: 2 seats are given to the largest party and 1 to the second largest party. Party-list PR is used for the nationwide seats.
* Pakistan
* Seychelles

===Former use===
* Albania used parallel voting in the 1996 and 1997 elections (before switching to mixed-member proportional representation from 2001 to 2005).
* Argentina: Santiago del Estero Province (1997–2009)
* Armenia
* Azerbaijan&#x27;s National Assembly (the Milli Məclis) had previously used an SM system in which 100 members were elected for five-year terms in single-seat constituencies and 25 were members were elected by proportional representation. Since the latest election Azerbaijan has returned to electing members from single-member constituencies. Due to the corruption present within Azerbaijan, the limited proportionality that SM was able to offer had little effect.
*Bulgaria (1990, 2009)
* Croatia (1993–2001)
* Egypt (2020)
* Georgia (1990–2024): Georgia initially used a two-round system for its constituency seats. Up until 2016, 73 seats out of 150 seats were allocated in constituencies. In the 2020 election, this number was reduced to 30 out of 150 as a result of the 2019 protests. By 2024, Georgia will switch to a fully proportional electoral system.
* Italy (1993–2005, with modifications)
* North Macedonia (1998)
* Palestinian Authority (2005), for the next election, the system was changed to party-list proportional representation.
*South Korea: (1988-2024) National Assembly used parallel voting from 1988 to 2019. From 2019 to 2024, it uses a hybrid system of parallel voting and mixed-member proportional, with both compensatory seats (30) and supplementary seats (17).
*Ukraine: In the last elections to the Verkhovna Rada, a parallel voting system was used. 50% of seats are distributed under party lists with a 5% election threshold and 50% through first-past-the-post in single-member constituencies. The method of 50/50 mixed elections was used in the 2002, 2012, 2014 and 2019 elections; however, in 2006 and 2007, the elections were held under a proportional system only. According to the election law that became valid on 1 January 2020 the next election to the Verkhovna Rada again will be held under a proportional scheme.
===Proposals for use===
In New Zealand, the Royal Commission on the Electoral System reviewed the electoral system in 1985–86 and considered parallel voting as a possible replacement for the single-member plurality (SMP) system in use at the time.

The commission came to the conclusion that parallel voting would be unable to overcome the shortcomings of New Zealand&#x27;s previous SMP system. The total seats won by a party would likely remain out of proportion to its share of votes—there would be a &quot;considerable imbalance between share of the votes and share of the total seats&quot;—and it would be unfair to minor parties (who would struggle to win constituency seats). In the indicative 1992 electoral referendum, parallel voting was one of four choices for an alternative electoral system (alongside MMP, AV and STV), but came last with only 5.5 percent of the vote. An overwhelming majority of voters supported MMP, as recommended by the Royal Commission, and the system was adopted after the 1993 electoral referendum.

In another referendum in 2011, 57.77% of voters elected to keep current the MMP system. Among the 42.23% that voted to change to another system, a plurality (46.66%) preferred a return to the pre-1994 SMP system. Parallel voting was the second-most popular choice, with 24.14% of the vote.

<text>The African Unification Front (AUF) is an organisation aiming to promote the political, social and economic union of Africa.

==History==
AUF was formed in August 1996. The AUF advocates for transformation of Africa into a federation, with the Pan African Parliament as the highest government, overseeing key institutions including a single currency, and one all-African army. The AUF promoted the creation of the African Union in the mid-1990s and continues to advocate for an end to neocolonialism. It has also been active in campaigns against abuses by the diamond industry, weapons traders, and unfair terms of trade in the coffee industry.

==Organization==
The AUF National Committee is the body that elects the AUF president. The AUF Executive Committee is the body that implements policies and oversees the day-to-day administration of the AUF. AUF has been responsible for initiating and organizing several strategies, including the AUF&#x27;s Fairtrade Coffee Campaign that pushed for reforms in the coffee industry.

The AUF, also known as the African Front, consists of a worldwide network of supporters, who believe that Africa must be unified into a federation as a means of securing peace and an end to wars and poverty. Although most members of the AUF are Africans, membership is open to non-Africans.

===Past leaders===
Other past AUF leaders have been Fesseha Demessae who served as Deputy Secretary General and Director of Cultural Affairs, and former vice-president Mongezi Sefika wa Nkomo.

Kirimi Kaberia was the first president of the AUF. Mouhamed Taofic Youssouf served briefly as AUF president, after Kirimi Kaberia accepted a posting as deputy ambassador for Kenya in Washington DC, USA.

==In the PAP==
Following the creation of the Pan African Parliament, the AUF became the first All-African (continental) political party. Several PAP members are also members and supporters of the AUF.

AUF members who have served in the Pan African Parliament include Dr. Amani Walid Kabourou from Tanzania, Chrispin Mwitila Shumina from Zambia, and Loyce Bwambale from Uganda. Other influential supporters of the AUF include John Atta-Mills the president of Ghana, Alhaji Yahaya Ndu who is also a member of the AUF National Committee and the president of the African Renaissance Party in Nigeria, Alimamy Bakarr Sankoh, head of the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Democratic League (PDL), and Dr. Miria Matembe, formerly chair of the Pan African Parliament&#x27;s Rules Committee and a close ally of AU President Gertrude Mongella.

==Symbols==
The Maure is used as the AUF&#x27;s flag and emblem. The head is blindfolded representing the impartiality of justice, and the knot is tied into a stylized Adinkra symbol for omnipotence (Gye Nyame).

<text>The Weizmann Institute of Science ( &quot;Machon Weizmann LeMada&quot;) is a public research university in Rehovot, Israel, established in 1934, fourteen years before the State of Israel was founded. Unlike other Israeli universities it exclusively offers postgraduate-only degrees in the natural and exact sciences.

The institute is a multidisciplinary research center, employing around 3,800 scientists, postdoctoral fellows, Ph.D. and M.Sc. students, and scientific, technical, and administrative staff working at the institute.

As of 2019, the Weizmann Institute of Science has been associated with six Nobel laureates and three Turing Award winners.

==History==
The institute was founded in 1934 by Chaim Weizmann and his initial (1st) team, which included Benjamin M. Bloch, as the Daniel Sieff Research Institute. Weizmann had invited Nobel Prize laureate Fritz Haber to be the director, but following Haber&#x27;s death en route to Palestine, Weizmann assumed the directorship himself. Before he became President of Israel in February 1949, Weizmann conducted his research in organic chemistry at its laboratories. On November 2, 1949, in agreement with the Sieff family, the institute was renamed the Weizmann Institute of Science in his honor.

WEIZAC, one of the world&#x27;s first electronic computers was locally built by the institute in 1954–1955 and was recognized by the IEEE in 2006 as a milestone achievement in the history of electrical and electronic engineering.

In 1959, the institute set up a wholly owned subsidiary called Yeda Research and Development Company to commercialize inventions made at the institute. Yeda has more marine genetic patents than any other research institute. By 2013 the institute was earning between $50 and $100 million in royalties annually on marketed drugs including Copaxone, Rebif, and Erbitux.

==Graduate program==
As of 2015, the Weizmann Institute had approximately 2,500 students, postdoctoral fellows, staff, and faculty, and awards M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology, as well as several interdisciplinary programs. The symbol of the Weizmann Institute of Science is the multibranched &quot;Ficus&quot; tree. Undergraduates and recent graduates must apply to M.Sc. programs, while those earning an M.Sc. or an MD can apply directly to Ph.D. programs. Full fellowships are given to all students.

==Youth programs==

In addition to its academic programs, the Weizmann Institute runs programs for youth, including science clubs, camps, and competitions. The Bessie F. Lawrence International Summer Science Institute accepts high-school graduates from all over the world for a four-week, science-based summer camp. The Clore Garden of Science, which opened in 1999, is the world&#x27;s first completely interactive outdoor science museum.

==Rankings==
The Weizmann Institute of Science was ranked number 2, globally, for research quality by the Nature Index in 2019, and in the top 25 research institutes/universities in the world in two main categories by U-Multirank, 2019: Top Cited Publications and Patents Awarded. The institute was in 7th place in the European Research Council report in 2020 for its high rate of success in obtaining research grants.
In 2018 the institute was ranked 9th, globally, (1st in Israel) by the CWTS Leiden Ranking, which is based on the proportion of a university&#x27;s scientific papers published between 2012 and 2015 that made the 10% most cited in their field.

==Presidents==

The nonscientists Abba Eban and Meyer Weisgal were assisted by scientific directors, as was Weizmann himself owing to his duties as the first president of Israel. The following persons held the position of scientific director:

<text>Henry Quelch (30 January, 1858 – 17 September, 1913) was one of the first Marxists and founders of the social democratic movement in Great Britain. He was a socialist activist, journalist and trade unionist. His brother, Lorenzo &quot;Len&quot; Quelch, was also a socialist activist, while his son, Tom Quelch, achieved note as a prominent communist activist.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Harry Quelch was born 30 January 1858 in the small town of Hungerford, Berkshire, England. He was the son and grandson of a village blacksmith; his maternal grandfather had been an agricultural labourer.

Circumstances forced the eldest child, Harry, into the world to contribute to the family&#x27;s maintenance from a very young age, with Harry taking his first job at the age of 10. He worked variously in an upholsterer&#x27;s shop and later for a local dairyman and cattle dealer. At the age of 14 he left Berkshire for good to make his way in the big city of London.

In London the boy worked a succession of jobs in a biscuit factory, in a tannery, and in an iron foundry before landing a better job as a packer in a paper warehouse. This last job allowed the boy sufficient free time to teach himself French. It was in this language that he first read the writing of Karl Marx as part of the process of his self-education. It was in this way that he was converted to the ideas of Social-Democracy. He also later taught himself German, the &quot;de facto&quot; official language of international socialism.

Quelch married in 1879 and soon fathered a family of his own. His son, Tom, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a radical political activist, becoming a founding member of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

===Political career===

Harry Quelch joined the Democratic Federation (forerunner of the Social Democratic Federation, SDF) in 1881 at the age of 23. Just two years later the young man was elected to its executive. In April 1884 Quelch became an international delegate of the British socialist movement for the first time when he and Hyndman were sent to Paris to attend a congress of the French Workers&#x27; Party.

When a large section of the party&#x27;s active membership, led by William Morris, departed the SDF in 1884 to form the Socialist League, Quelch stayed behind, redoubling his efforts on behalf of the organisation. it was around this time that Quelch&#x27;s abilities as a speaker and journalist began to fully develop.

Quelch became the full-time editor of the SDF&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Justice&quot;. He also represented the SDF on bodies including various strike committees and the Trades Union Congress, and at socialist conferences across Europe. He was heavily involved in the London dock strike of 1889, and was the main organiser and first general secretary of the South Side Labour Protection League, a union for dock workers founded after the strike. He was elected several times as the chair of the London Trades Council, and was one of the founders of the Labour Representation Committee. From 1892 until the end of 1908, he was also the business manager for the 20th Century Press, a radical publisher.

In 1901, Quelch arranged for the SDF to print Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Iskra&quot; which had been banned in Russia. A thin partition was installed in a small corner of the printing works and Quelch was forced to &quot;squeeze up&quot; into these cramped quarters as a makeshift editorial office to make room for the Russians. There was only room for a small writing desk with a bookshelf above it and a single chair.

Quelch was a perennial representative of the British socialist movement to international gatherings of the Second International. He attended Congress of the International in Paris in 1889, Brussels in 1891, Zurich in 1893, London in 1896, Paris in 1900, Amsterdam in 1904, Stuttgart in 1907, and finally at Copenhagen in 1910.

It was as a delegate of the SDF to the 1907 Stuttgart Congress that Quelch achieved his greatest notoriety as an international socialist. There in a speech he condemned an international conference of diplomats then sitting at The Hague, attended by Tsar Nicholas II, as a &quot;thieves&#x27; supper.&quot; Government authorities were swift in expelling Quelch from the country for his remarks, an action which boosted British esteem in the eyes of their radical peers.

===Death and legacy===

Harry Quelch was chronically ill from about the beginning of 1912 until his death in London on 17 September 1913, at the age of 55. Sanitariums and bracing sea air proved insufficient to cure whatever the illness from which he suffered. His funeral was a political event, attended by socialists from all over the country. He was buried at Camberwell Old Cemetery, Southwark, on Saturday, 20 September.

Lenin remembered his friend with a memorial article published in the Bolshevik newspapers &quot;Pravda Truda&quot; [Labour Truth] and &quot;Nash Put&quot;&#x27; [Our Path]:
Harry Quelch was one of the most energetic and devoted workers in the British Social-Democratic movement. He was active not only as a Social-Democratic Party worker, but also as a trade unionist. The London Society of Compositors repeatedly elected him its chairman, and he was several times Chairman of the London Trades Council.He took a very active part in all the work of the British Social-Democratic movement and regularly addressed party and public meetings. On many occasions he represented British Social-Democracy at international congresses and on the International Socialist Bureau.Quelch was in the front ranks of those who fought steadfastly and with conviction against opportunism and a liberal-labour policy in the British working class movement... [O]ver the whole of Britain the Social-Democrats, and they &quot;alone&quot;, have for decades been carrying on systematic propaganda and agitation in the Marxist spirit. This is the great historical service rendered by Quelch and his comrades.

<text>Edwin Lee Mathews (October 13, 1931 – February 18, 2001) was an American professional baseball third baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 17 seasons for the Boston / Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves (1952–1966); Houston Astros (1967) and Detroit Tigers (1967–68). Inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978, he is the only player to have represented the Braves in the three cities they have called home. He played 1,944 games for the Braves during their 13-season tenure in Milwaukee—the prime of Mathews&#x27; career.

Mathews is regarded as one of the best third basemen ever to play the game. He was an All-Star for nine seasons. He won the National League (NL) home run title in 1953 and 1959 and was the NL Most Valuable Player runner-up both of those seasons. He hit 512 home runs during his major league career. Mathews coached for the Atlanta Braves in 1971, and he was the team&#x27;s manager from 1972 to 1974. Later, he was a scout and coach for the Texas Rangers, Milwaukee Brewers, and Oakland Athletics.

==Early years==
Mathews was born in Texarkana, Texas. He was six years old when his family moved to Santa Barbara, California. The Santa Barbara High School baseball field, where he developed into a star high school baseball player, is named after him. Mathews was signed by the Boston Braves in 1949. He played 63 games that year for the Class D High Point-Thomasville Hi-Toms, where he hit 17 home runs and earned a .363 batting average. The next year he hit 32 home runs for the Class AA Atlanta Crackers.

==MLB career==

===Boston, Milwaukee, and Atlanta Braves===
After splitting 1951 between the Crackers and Triple-A Milwaukee Brewers, Mathews made the Braves&#x27; major league roster out of spring training in 1952. He hit 25 home runs, including three in one game versus Brooklyn on September 27. In 1953, the Braves moved to Milwaukee where he batted .302 and posted career highs of 47 home runs and 135 RBIs. For nine straight seasons he hit at least 30 home runs, including leading the National League twice (1953, 1959).

As one of 1954&#x27;s superstars in American sports, Mathews was chosen for the cover of the first-ever issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine. Around this time, Ty Cobb said of Mathews: &quot;I&#x27;ve only known three or four perfect swings in my time. This lad has one of them.&quot; Mathews was a powerful pull hitter, and for many years of his career teams would implement the &quot;Mathews shift&quot; when he came to bat. The second baseman would shift well to his left, toward first base, and the shortstop would come to the second base side of the bag, leaving a gaping hole between second and third base. Mathews delighted in occasionally punching the ball through that hole.

The Braves won the 1957 National League championship. In the World Series, Mathews hit a game-winning home run in the tenth inning of game four. The Braves went on to defeat the New York Yankees in seven games. Mathews made the final out of the Series, a forceout of Gil McDougald on Moose Skowron&#x27;s hard-hit grounder.

Mathews was regarded as one of the strongest power hitters of his time, often being compared to American League contemporary Mickey Mantle, in terms of power hitting strength. Hall of Fame teammate Warren Spahn once said of the two: &quot;Mathews is just as strong as Mantle. They don&#x27;t hit the same – Mantle gets all of his weight into his swing; Mathews uses his wrists more.&quot; Spahn&#x27;s comment on Mathews&#x27; use of his wrists was in reference to his unique swing, as believed by many to be one of the more graceful swings in baseball history. Pitcher Sal Maglie noticed, however, that Mathews had a tendency to chase &quot;the low curve on the three-and-two pitch.&quot; Mathews is the only player to play for the Braves in Boston, Milwaukee, and Atlanta. By the Braves&#x27; first season in Atlanta, Matthews was the last Boston Brave still on an active roster.

Mathews is also one of just two players to homer with a teammate in the same game at least 50 times with two different teammates. He did this with Henry Aaron 75 times and with Joe Adcock 56 times. Willie Mays is the other, with Willie McCovey (68) and Orlando Cepeda (50), to do it.

Between 1954 and 1966, he and Braves teammate Hank Aaron hit 863 home runs (Aaron 442, Mathews 421), moving ahead of the Yankees duo of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig as the all-time leaders in major league history.

===Houston Astros and Detroit Tigers===
The Braves traded Mathews, Arnold Umbach, and a player to be named later to the Houston Astros for Dave Nicholson and Bob Bruce after the 1966 season. He had spent his entire adult life up to that point with the Braves franchise. In 1967, Mathews became the seventh player to hit 500 career home runs, becoming a member of the 500 home run club on July 14 coming off pitcher Juan Marichal of the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park. He was the second National Leaguer to reach that milestone, behind only Ott. 

After just 101 games in Houston, Mathews was traded again — this time from the Astros to the Detroit Tigers, who were in the midst of a heated pennant race with the Boston Red Sox. 

Mathews would play his final Major League season in Detroit, as the Tigers would win the American League pennant for the first time since 1945. 

He would make his final World Series appearance, getting a hit and drawing a walk in four plate appearances as the Tigers defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games.

Upon his retirement, he was sixth in all-time home runs with 512. At the time, his 503 home runs in the National League were second in the Senior Circuit&#x27;s history, behind only Ott. Over his career, he was named to the All-Star team twelve times (MLB held two All-Star Games from 1959 through 1962), played in three World Series, and drove in 100 or more runs five times. He never won an MVP award (finishing second twice, behind Roy Campanella in 1953 and behind Ernie Banks in 1959), although he did win the NL Player of the Month award in September 1959 (.303, 11 HR, 25 RBI).

===Career statistics===
In 2391 games over 17 seasons, Mathews posted a .271 batting average (2315-for-8537) with 1509 runs, 354 doubles, 72 triples, 512 home runs, 1453 RBI, 68 stolen bases, 1444 bases on balls, .376 on-base percentage and .509 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .959 fielding percentage playing primarily at third base but also at first base and left field. In 16 World Series games, he batted .200 (10-for-50) with 7 runs, 5 doubles, 1 home run, 7 RBI, 1 stolen base and 15 walks.

===Coaching and managing===
In 1971, Mathews became a coach, and then in the midseason of 1972, manager of the Atlanta Braves. Mathews is one of the very few players to have played, coached, and managed for the same baseball team. The Braves were 47–57 under Lum Harris and in fourth place in the National League West Division when Mathews took command on August 7. The 1972 Braves finished 23–27 under Mathews as manager, ending up 25 games behind the Cincinnati Reds. The 1973 Braves then finished fifth (76–85), 22 games out of first place.

Mathews was the Braves&#x27; manager when Hank Aaron hit his 715th home run on April 8, 1974. But on July 21, 1974, Mathews was fired when the team went into a slump and fell into fourth place with a 50–49 record. Aaron and Darrell Evans both criticized the decision to terminate Mathews. Evans said that Mathews was a friend and Aaron said that the decision was &quot;a blow to me.&quot; Mathews stated the Braves indicated there would be a job for him within the organization, but he said he was not sure what he would do next. The Braves went 149–161 (.481) during Mathews&#x27; time at the helm.

==After retirement==
Mathews was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1976. 

In 1978, Mathews was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

In 1982, Mathews was a minor league instructor for the Oakland Athletics when a spot was found on his lung. He was ultimately admitted to a hospital to investigate it, where doctors ruled out cancer, but he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, treated then returned to his work with the Oakland organization.

In 1999, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; ranked Mathews 63 on their list of 100, &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot;. He was also nominated that year as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Mathews at number 46 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

==Personal life==
Mathews was married to Virjean Lauby in 1954 and they divorced in 1970. He was married and divorced a second time, then married Elizabeth Busch Burke, daughter of brewing executive Gussie Busch, in 1977.

Sportswriter Bob Wolf of the &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; indicated that Mathews&#x27; election to the Baseball Hall of Fame may have been delayed because of his cool relationship with the media. Mathews seemed to resent the intrusion of reporters in his personal life, especially early in his career. He gestured with his fist at a reporter when he was in court on charges of reckless driving. He was angered by the presence of the media at his 1954 wedding ceremony at a county clerk&#x27;s office.

==Death==
In February 2001, Mathews died from complications of pneumonia in La Jolla in San Diego, California, and was buried in Santa Barbara Cemetery. Later that year during the baseball season, the Atlanta Braves honored Mathews with the placement of patches bearing his retired uniform number, 41, on their jerseys.

<doc id="428558" wikidata="Q637484" url="?curid=428558" title="Bicycle pump">
<text>A bicycle pump is a type of positive-displacement air pump specifically designed for inflating bicycle tires. It has a connection or adapter for use with one or both of the two most common types of valves used on bicycles, Schrader or Presta. A third type of valve called the Dunlop (or Woods) valve exists, but tubes with these valves can be filled using a Presta pump.

Several basic types are available:
* Floor pumps
* Frame-mounted
* Compact or mini
* Foot-operated
* Double-action
* Blast or tubeless

In its most basic form, a bicycle pump functions via a hand-operated piston. During up-stroke, this piston draws air through a one-way valve into the pump from outside. During down-stroke, the piston then displaces air from the pump into the bicycle tire. Most floor pumps, also commonly called track pumps, have a built-in pressure gauge to indicate tire pressure.

Electrically-operated pumps intended to inflate car tires (as available in most service stations) can in principle be used to inflate a bicycle tire if the right type of connection is available. Some such pumps are designed to cut off before a suitable pressure (much higher for a bicycle than a car tire), and will much under inflate the tire. Others may not cut off, but deliver a high rate of flow to fill the larger car tire, with a risk of over inflating and bursting a bicycle tire unless it is stopped with split-second timing.

Inflating tubeless tires requires an initial surge of air to seat the bead, and specialized pumps are available specifically for this task.

==History==
It is not known when the first bicycle pump was invented, but it is believed to have been in or around 1887, which is when the first inflatable tire or pneumatic tire was produced by John Boyd Dunlop of Scotland. The first bicycle pump consisted of a metal cylinder that had a metal rod running down the middle of it. This would have forced the air out of the cylinder and then sucked in new air when the metal rod was pulled up again. Many modern pumps use a very similar method, while some, such as the electric pumps, use an automated pumping mechanism.

==How they work==
The bicycle pump compresses air. When the cylinder is compressed, air is pushed down the tube of the pump and then into the tire via the valve, which is forced open by the pressure of the air. When the handle is pulled up again, the valve shuts off automatically so that the air cannot escape from the tire, and new air is forced back into the cylinder so the process can be repeated. Some pumps have a gauge that shows the pressure of air that is forced into the tire. Once the tire is at the correct pressure, the pump valve can be removed from the tire, and the cap can be replaced on the tire valve.

There are two main types of tire valves to which the bicycle tire pump attaches. These are the Presta valve and the Schrader valve. Some pumps fit both types of valves, whereas others do not, but adapters are available that enable the pump to fit any type of valve. &quot;All valves adjustable connecting systems,&quot; also known as AVACS, enable the pump to fit any type of valve found on a bicycle, and it also has the capacity to fit onto other universal inflatable products, such as balls, paddling pools, and rubber rings. The AVACS feature is commonly available on pump models and can also be bought as a separate valve attachment.
It also works by repeatedly pulling and pushing activities of the Piston.

==Types==
There are three main types of bicycle pumps

*Stand pump
*Hand pump
*Foot pump

=== Stand pump ===
Also known as a floor or track pump. To operate, the user rests the base of the pump on the floor, resting feet at the base, and pulls and pushes full strokes with handles. An additional tube must connect the pump to the fill valve, which may create dead volume.

=== Hand pump ===
There are two basic types: tubed and integral. The tubed type requires a separate tube to connect the pump to the valve. These have the advantage that they are cheap, but are inefficient compared to other pumps. They also have a lot of joints from which air can escape.

Integral pumps have a hole in the side with a rubber washer that fits round the valve. This is frequently compressed on to the valve by an extra lever. Because it is well sealed, rigid and has little dead volume, this type of pump is very efficient. An 8″ integral will typically pump faster than an 18″ tubed. These type of pumps will run the risk of shredding the tube valves, especially on those with presta valves.

A simple pump has a cupped fiber or plastic piston. On the forward stroke the air pushes the sides of the cup against the cylinder, so forming a seal; it provides its own valve. Then this piston can push the air out of the hole at the far end.

Some of the most efficient pumps are double action pumps. By sealing the piston in the cylinder at both ends they can force air into the tire on both strokes.

Pumps can be fitted to a bracket on the bike frame, either a clamp on, screw on, or a braze-on peg, or they can be carried in a pannier or other bag on the bike, or they can be carried by the rider in a backpack, pocket, etc.

==== Mini pump ====
Mini pumps (or compact pumps) are usually hand pumps that have been made very small and light, so that they can readily be carried on a bicycle for emergency use; they can fit in pockets, saddle bags, or even include a water bottle bracket. Because of their small size, the volume of air that these pumps can provide is somewhat limited compared to a floor pump, so quite a lot of pumping may be needed.

=== Foot pump ===
These pumps are often not specifically designed for bicycle use. They do not generate very high pressures so do not work well for narrow road-bike tires, but are fine for large low-pressure tires as found on mountain bikes.

Because they are designed for cars they fit Schrader valves. If the bicycle has Presta valves a small brass reducer is required in order to use the pump.

=== CO2 inflators ===
Gas-filled cylinders for bicycles have an unclear history but appear to have appeared between the two World Wars. One story says they were made &quot;by a rider after watching a café proprietor charge up the glass of beer he had ordered from a bottle of carbon dioxide.&quot;

The pumps generally used liquefied gas that could not be replaced at home. A later version, which had more success, used a cartridge sold originally for drinks siphons. A lever broke the cartridge and enough gas escaped to inflate a tire.

Modern gas pumps are often used by mountain bike or road bike racers who need to save weight, and to save time if they puncture during a race. They can be a one-time pump or a pump that can be fitted with a replacement cartridge. Most pumps use carbon dioxide and standard-threaded 16g CO2 canisters. Carbon dioxide leaks out of a rubber inner tube more rapidly than air - despite its larger molecule size, the CO2 molecule is significantly more soluble than Oxygen and Nitrogen in rubber and as such can cause a tire to deflate far quicker than if filled with air.

=== Electric pump ===
Twelve-volt air compressors made for automobile tires are also compatible with bicycle tires. A portable jump-starter for automobiles can sometimes be used to power these types of pumps. Even non-standard do-it-yourself (DIY) 12-volt electric systems that are primarily for bicycle lighting are sometimes used to power these pumps when cigar lighter receptacles are installed. A main advantage to electric pumps is that recent ones take up less space than hand or foot pumps, which makes them suitable for well-equipped bicycles with DIY 12-volt electric systems to use when basket space is of the essence.

==Tire pressure==
The pressure rating of tires is usually stamped somewhere on the sidewall. This may be in psi (pounds per square inch) or bar. The pressure rating could be indicated as &quot;Maximum Pressure,&quot; or &quot;Inflate to . . . &quot; and will usually give a range (for example, 90-120 psi, or 35-60 psi). Inflating to the lower number in the pressure range will increase traction and make the ride more comfortable. Inflating to the higher number will make the ride more efficient and will decrease the chances of getting a flat tire but a firmer ride must be expected.

===Pressure output===
The maximum pressure, or how much air the pump can force into a tire, is an important consideration. The pump needs to match or exceed the stated air pressure the tires can handle. If the maximum air pressure is too low, it will not be able to adequately inflate the tires, no matter how hard it is used.

<text>Martha Graham (May 11, 1894 – April 1, 1991) was an American modern dancer and choreographer, whose style, the Graham technique, reshaped American dance and is still taught worldwide.

Graham danced and taught for over seventy years. She was the first dancer to perform at the White House, travel abroad as a cultural ambassador, and receive the highest civilian award of the US: the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction. In her lifetime she received honors ranging from the Key to the City of Paris to Japan&#x27;s Imperial Order of the Precious Crown.

She said, in the 1994 documentary &quot;The Dancer Revealed&quot;: &quot;I have spent all my life with dance and being a dancer. It&#x27;s permitting life to use you in a very intense way. Sometimes it is not pleasant. Sometimes it is fearful. But nevertheless it is inevitable.&quot;

Founded in 1926 (the same year as Graham&#x27;s professional dance company), the Martha Graham School is the oldest school of dance in the United States. First located in a small studio within Carnegie Hall, the school currently has two different studios in New York City.

==Early life==
Graham was born in Allegheny City, later to become part of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1894. Her father, George Graham, practiced as what in the Victorian era was known as an &quot;alienist&quot;, a practitioner of an early form of psychiatry. The Grahams were strict Presbyterians. Her father was a third-generation American of Irish descent. Graham&#x27;s mother, Jane Beers, was a second-generation American of Irish, Scots-Irish, and English ancestry, and who claimed to be a tenth-generation descendant of Myles Standish. While her parents provided a comfortable environment in her youth, it was not one that encouraged dancing.

The Graham family moved to Santa Barbara, California, when Martha was fourteen years old. In 1911, she attended the first dance performance of her life, watching Ruth St. Denis perform at the Mason Opera House in Los Angeles. In the mid-1910s, Martha Graham began her studies at the newly created Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts, founded by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, at which she would stay until 1923. In 1922, Graham performed one of Shawn&#x27;s Egyptian dances with Lillian Powell in a short silent film by Hugo Riesenfeld that attempted to synchronize a dance routine on film with a live orchestra and an onscreen conductor.

==Career==
Graham left the Denishawn establishment in 1923 in order to become a featured dancer in the Greenwich Village Follies revue for two years. As a result, she felt a strong urge to make dance an art form that was more grounded in the rawness of the human experience and orientalism as opposed to just a mere form of entertainment. This motivated Graham to strip away the more decorative movements of ballet and of her training at the Denishawn school and focus more on the foundational aspects of movement.

In 1925, Graham was employed at the Eastman School of Music where Rouben Mamoulian was head of the School of Drama. Among other performances, together Mamoulian and Graham produced a short two-color film called &quot;The Flute of Krishna,&quot; featuring Eastman students. Mamoulian left Eastman shortly thereafter and Graham chose to leave also, even though she was asked to stay on.

In 1926, the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance was established, in a small studio on the Upper East Side of New York City. On April 18 of the same year Graham debuted her first independent concert, consisting of 18 short solos and trios that she had choreographed. This performance took place at the 48th Street Theatre in Manhattan. She would later say of the concert: &quot;Everything I did was influenced by Denishawn.&quot; On November 28, 1926, Graham and others in her company gave a dance recital at the Klaw Theatre in New York City. Around the same time she entered an extended collaboration with Japanese-American pictorialist photographer Soichi Sunami, and over the next five years they together created some of the most iconic images of early modern dance. Graham was on the faculty of Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre when it opened in 1928.

One of Graham&#x27;s students was heiress Bethsabée de Rothschild with whom she became close friends. When Rothschild moved to Israel and established the Batsheva Dance Company in 1965, Graham became the company&#x27;s first director.

Graham&#x27;s technique pioneered a principle known as &quot;contraction and release&quot; in modern dance, which was derived from a stylized conception of breathing.

Contraction and release:
The desire to highlight a more base aspect of human movement led Graham to create the &quot;contraction and release&quot;, for which she would become known. Each movement could separately be used to express either positive or negative, freeing or constricting emotions depending on the placement of the head. The contraction and release were both the basis for Graham&#x27;s weighted and grounded style, which is in direct opposition to classical ballet techniques that typically aim to create an illusion of weightlessness. To counter the more percussive and staccato movements, Graham eventually added the spiral shape to the vocabulary of her technique to incorporate a sense of fluidity.

===New era in dance===

Following her first concert made up of solos, Graham created &quot;Heretic&quot; (1929), the first group piece of many that showcased a clear diversion from her days with Denishawn, and served as an insight to her work that would follow in the future. Made up of constricted and sharp movement with the dancers clothed unglamorously, the piece centered on the theme of rejection—one that would reoccur in other Graham works down the line.

As time went on Graham moved away from the more stark design aesthetic she initially embraced and began incorporating more elaborate sets and scenery to her work. To do this, she collaborated often with Isamu Noguchi—a Japanese American designer—whose eye for set design was complementary to Graham&#x27;s choreography.

Within the many themes which Graham incorporated into her work, there were two that she seemed to adhere to the most—Americana and Greek mythology. One of Graham&#x27;s most known pieces that incorporates the American life theme is &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; (1944). She collaborated with the composer Aaron Copland—who won a Pulitzer Prize for his work on the piece—and Noguchi, who created the nonliteral set. As she did often, Graham placed herself in her own piece as the bride of a newly married couple whose optimism for starting a new life together is countered by a grounded pioneer woman and a sermon-giving revivalist. Two of Graham&#x27;s pieces—&quot;Cave of the Heart&quot; (1946) and &quot;Night Journey&quot; (1947)—display her interest in not only Greek mythology but also with the psyche of a woman, as both pieces retell Greek myths from a woman&#x27;s point of view.

In 1936, Graham created &quot;Chronicle&quot;, which brought serious issues to the stage in a dramatic manner. Influenced by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Great Depression that followed, and the Spanish Civil War, the dance focused on depression and isolation, reflected in the dark nature of both the set and costumes.

The same year, in conjunction with the 1936 Summer Olympic Games in Berlin, the German government wanted to include dance in the Art Competitions that took place during the Olympics, an event that previously included architecture, sculpture, painting, music, and literature. Although Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Propaganda, was not appreciative of the modern dance art form and changed Germany&#x27;s dance from more avant-garde to traditional, he and Adolf Hitler still agreed to invite Graham to represent the United States. However, the United States was not represented in the Art Competitions as Graham refused the invitation by stating:

I would find it impossible to dance in Germany at the present time. So many artists whom I respect and admire have been persecuted, have been deprived of the right to work for ridiculous and unsatisfactory reasons, that I should consider it impossible to identify myself, by accepting the invitation, with the regime that has made such things possible. In addition, some of my concert group would not be welcomed in Germany.

Goebbels himself wrote her a letter assuring her that her Jewish dancers would &quot;receive complete immunity&quot;, however, it was not enough for Graham to accept such an invitation.

Stimulated by the occurrences of the 1936 Olympic Games, and the propaganda that she heard through the radio from the Axis Powers, Graham created &quot;American Document&quot; in 1938. The dance expressed American ideals and democracy as Graham realized that it could empower men and inspire them to fight fascist and Nazi ideologies. American Document ended up as a patriotic statement focusing on rights and injustices of the time, representing the American people including its Native-American heritage and slavery. During the performance, excerpts from the U.S. Declaration of Independence, Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address, and the Emancipation Proclamation were read. These were passages that highlighted the American ideals and represented what made the American people American. For Graham, a dance needed to &quot;reveal certain national characteristics because without these characteristics the dance would have no validity, no roots, no direct relation to life&quot;.

The beginning of American Document marks modern concepts of performance art joining dance, theater and literature and clearly defining the roles of the spectator and the actors/dancers. The narrator/actor starts with &quot;establishing an awareness of the present place and time, which serves not only as a bridge between past and present, but also between individual and collective, particular and general&quot;. Together with her unique technique, this sociological and philosophical innovation sets dance as a clear expression of current ideas and places and Graham as a pillar of the modern dance revolution.

1938 became a big year for Graham; the Roosevelts invited Graham to dance at the White House, making her the first dancer to perform there. Also, in 1938, Erick Hawkins became the first man to dance with her company. He officially joined her troupe the following year, dancing male lead in a number of Graham&#x27;s works. They were married in July 1948 after the New York premiere of &quot;Night Journey&quot;. He left her troupe in 1951 and they divorced in 1954.

On April 1, 1958, the Martha Graham Dance Company premiered the ballet &quot;Clytemnestra&quot;, based on the ancient Greek legend Clytemnestra and it became a huge success and great accomplishment for Graham. With a score by Egyptian-born composer Halim El-Dabh, this ballet was a large scale work and the only full-length work in Graham&#x27;s career. Graham choreographed and danced the title role, spending almost the entire duration of the performance on the stage. The ballet was based on the Greek mythology of the same title and tells the story of Queen Clytemnestra who is married to King Agamemnon. Agamemnon sacrifices their daughter, Iphigenia, on a pyre, as an offering to the gods to assure fair winds to Troy, where the Trojan War rages. Upon Agamemnon&#x27;s return after 10 years, Clytemnestra kills Agamemnon to avenge the murder of Iphigenia. Clytemnestra is then murdered by her son, Orestes, and the audience experiences Clytemnestra in the afterworld. This ballet was deemed a masterpiece of 20th-century American modernism and was so successful it had a limited engagement showing at the 54th Street Theatre on Broadway, conducted by Robert Irving, voice parts sung by Rosalia Maresca and Ronald Holgate.

Graham collaborated with many composers including Aaron Copland on &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot;, Louis Horst, Samuel Barber, William Schuman, Carlos Surinach, Norman Dello Joio, and Gian Carlo Menotti. Graham&#x27;s mother died in Santa Barbara in 1958. Her oldest friend and musical collaborator Louis Horst died in 1964. She said of Horst: &quot;His sympathy and understanding, but primarily his faith, gave me a landscape to move in. Without it, I should certainly have been lost.&quot;

Graham resisted requests for her dances to be recorded because she believed that live performances should only exist on stage as they are experienced. There were a few notable exceptions. For example, in addition to her collaboration with Sunami in the 1920s, she also worked on a limited basis with still photographers Imogen Cunningham in the 1930s, and Barbara Morgan in the 1940s. Graham considered Philippe Halsman&#x27;s photographs of &quot;Dark Meadow&quot; the most complete photographic record of any of her dances. Halsman also photographed in the 1940s &quot;Letter to the World&quot;, &quot;Cave of the Heart&quot;, &quot;Night Journey&quot; and &quot;Every Soul is a Circus&quot;. In later years her thinking on the matter evolved and others convinced her to let them recreate some of what was lost. In 1952 Graham allowed taping of her meeting and cultural exchange with famed deaf-blind author, activist and lecturer Helen Keller, who, after a visit to one of Graham&#x27;s company rehearsals became a close friend and supporter. Graham was inspired by Keller&#x27;s joy from and interpretation of dance, utilizing her body to feel the vibration of drums and of feet and movement moving the air around her.
In her biography &quot;Martha&quot;, Agnes de Mille cites Graham&#x27;s last performance as having occurred on the evening of May 25, 1968, in &quot;Time of Snow&quot;. But in &quot;A Dancer&#x27;s Life&quot;, biographer Russell Freedman lists the year of Graham&#x27;s final performance as 1969. In her 1991 autobiography, &quot;Blood Memory&quot;, Graham herself lists her final performance as her 1970 appearance in &quot;Cortege of Eagles&quot; when she was 76 years old. Graham&#x27;s choreographies span 181 compositions.

==Retirement and later years==
In the years that followed her departure from the stage, Graham sank into a deep depression fueled by views from the wings of young dancers performing many of the dances she had choreographed for herself and her former husband. Graham&#x27;s health declined precipitously as she abused alcohol to numb her pain. In &quot;Blood Memory&quot; she wrote,

It wasn&#x27;t until years after I had relinquished a ballet that I could bear to watch someone else dance it. I believe in never looking back, never indulging in nostalgia, or reminiscing. Yet how can you avoid it when you look on stage and see a dancer made up to look as you did thirty years ago, dancing a ballet you created with someone you were then deeply in love with, your husband? I think that is a circle of hell Dante omitted.

[When I stopped dancing] I had lost my will to live. I stayed home alone, ate very little, and drank too much and brooded. My face was ruined, and people say I looked odd, which I agreed with. Finally my system just gave in. I was in the hospital for a long time, much of it in a coma.
Graham not only survived her hospital stay, but she rallied. In 1972, she quit drinking, returned to her studio, reorganized her company, and went on to choreograph ten new ballets and many revivals. Her last completed ballet was 1990&#x27;s &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;.

==Death==
Graham choreographed until her death in New York City from pneumonia in 1991, aged 96. Just before she became sick with pneumonia, she finished the final draft of her autobiography, &quot;Blood Memory&quot;, which was published posthumously in the fall of 1991. She was cremated, and her ashes were spread over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in northern New Mexico.

==Influence and legacy==
Graham has been sometimes termed the &quot;Picasso of Dance&quot; in that her importance and influence to modern dance can be considered equivalent to what Pablo Picasso was to modern visual arts. Her impact has been also compared to the influence of Stravinsky on music and Frank Lloyd Wright on architecture.

In 2013, the dance films by her were selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the registry&#x27;s owner, the Library of Congress.

To celebrate what would have been her 117th birthday on May 11, 2011, Google&#x27;s logo for one day was turned into one dedicated to Graham&#x27;s life and legacy.

Graham has been said to be the one that brought dance into the 20th century. Due to the work of her assistants, Linda Hodes, Pearl Lang, Diane Gray, Yuriko, and others, much of Graham&#x27;s work and technique have been preserved. They taped interviews of Graham describing her entire technique and videos of her performances. Glen Tetley told Agnes de Mille, &quot;The wonderful thing about Martha in her good days was her generosity. So many people stole Martha&#x27;s unique personal vocabulary, consciously or unconsciously, and performed it in concerts. I have never once heard Martha say, &#x27;So-and-so has used my choreography. An entire movement was created by her that revolutionized the dance world and created what is known today as modern dance. Now, dancers all over the world study and perform modern dance. Choreographers and professional dancers look to her for inspiration.

Agnes de Mille said:
The greatest thing [Graham] ever said to me was in 1943 after the opening of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, when I suddenly had unexpected, flamboyant success for a work I thought was only fairly good, after years of neglect for work I thought was fine. I was bewildered and worried that my entire scale of values was untrustworthy. I talked to Martha. I remember the conversation well. It was in a Schrafft&#x27;s restaurant over a soda. I confessed that I had a burning desire to be excellent, but no faith that I could be. Martha said to me, very quietly: &quot;There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep yourself open and aware to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open ... No artist is pleased. [There is] no satisfaction whatever at any time. There is only a queer divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others.&quot;

In 2021 actress Mary Beth Peil portrayed Graham in the Netflix series &quot;Halston&quot;.

==Martha Graham Dance Company==

The Martha Graham Dance Company is the oldest dance company in America, founded in 1926. It has helped develop many famous dancers and choreographers of the 20th and 21st centuries including Erick Hawkins, Anna Sokolow, Merce Cunningham, Lila York, and Paul Taylor. It continues to perform, including at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in June 2008. The company also performed in 2007 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, with a program consisting of: &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot;, &quot;Embattled Garden&quot;, &quot;Errand into the Maze&quot;, and &quot;American Original&quot;.

===Early dancers===
Graham&#x27;s original female dancers consisted of Bessie Schonberg, Evelyn Sabin, Martha Hill, Gertrude Shurr, Anna Sokolow, Nelle Fisher, Dorothy Bird, Bonnie Bird, Sophie Maslow, May O&#x27;Donnell, Jane Dudley, Anita Alvarez, Pearl Lang, and Marjorie G. Mazia. A second group included Yuriko, Ethel Butler, Ethel Winter, Jean Erdman, Patricia Birch, Nina Fonaroff, Matt Turney, Mary Hinkson. The group of men dancers was made up of Erick Hawkins, Merce Cunningham, David Campbell, John Butler, Robert Cohan, Stuart Hodes, Glen Tetley, Bertram Ross, Paul Taylor, Donald McKayle, Mark Ryder, and William Carter.

==Accolades==

During her career, Graham was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Choreography three times- one in 1932, one in 1943, and one in 1944.

In 1957, Graham was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1976 by President Gerald Ford (the First Lady Betty Ford had studied under Graham in her youth). Ford declared her &quot;a national treasure&quot;.

Graham was the first recipient of the Samuel H. Scripps/American Dance Festival Award for lifetime achievement in modern dance in 1981, presented by Betty Ford.

In 1984, Graham was awarded the highest French order of merit, the Legion of Honour by then Minister of culture Jack Lang.

Graham was inducted into the National Museum of Dance&#x27;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1987.

In 1990, the Council of Fashion Designers of America awarded Graham with the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 1998, Graham was posthumously named &quot;Dancer of the Century&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and one of the female &quot;Icons of the Century&quot; by &quot;People&quot;.

In 2015, she was posthumously inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

On May 11, 2020, on what would have been Graham&#x27;s 126th birthday, the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts announced it had acquired Graham&#x27;s archives for its Jerome Robbins Dance Division. The archive consists mainly of paper-based material, photographs and films, including rare footage of Graham dancing in works such as &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; and &quot;Hérodiade&quot;; her script for &quot;Night Journey&quot;; and her handwritten notes for &quot;American Document&quot;.

==Choreography==
This excerpt from John Martin&#x27;s reviews in &quot;The New York Times&quot; provides insight on Graham&#x27;s choreographic style. &quot;Frequently the vividness and intensity of her purpose are so potent that on the rise of the curtain they strike like a blow, and in that moment one must decide whether he is for or against her. She boils down her moods and movements until they are devoid of all extraneous substances and are concentrated to the highest degree.&quot; Graham created 181 ballets.

<text>Jonathan Penrose, (7 October 1933 – 30 November 2021) was an English chess player, who held the titles Grandmaster (1993) and International Correspondence Chess Grandmaster (1983). He won the British Chess Championship ten times between 1958 and 1969.

== Early years ==
Penrose was born in Colchester. Learning the game at age four, he was a member of Hampstead Chess Club at twelve and British Boys (Under 18) Champion at just fourteen years of age. Chess was played by the entire Penrose family. His father was a composer of endgame studies and a strong player, as was his older brother Oliver.

By the age of seventeen, he was already acknowledged as a top prospect for British chess. Playing Hastings for the first time in 1950/51, he beat the French champion Nicolas Rossolimo and at Southsea in 1950, defeated both Efim Bogoljubov and Savielly Tartakower. In 1952/1953 he shared the first place at Hastings with Harry Golombek, Antonio Medina García and Daniel Yanofsky.

== Playing career ==

Penrose earned the International Master title in 1961 and was the leading British player for several years in the 1960s and early 1970s, surpassing the achievement of Henry Ernest Atkins by winning the British Championship a record number of times. He was widely considered to be of grandmaster strength, but did not achieve the grandmaster title during his active playing career, despite some notable victories. This was mainly due to his choosing to remain amateur and placing his lecturing as a first priority. As a consequence, he played few international tournaments and frequently turned down invitations to prestigious tournaments such as Hastings. Nevertheless, FIDE made him a grandmaster in 1993.

He competed in eight Chess Olympiads between 1952 and 1962, then at the Olympiads of 1968 and 1970, frequently posting excellent scores, including +9−1=7 in 1962 (Varna), and +10−0=5 in 1968 (Lugano). On both of these occasions, he won an individual silver medal on first board; in 1968, his score was bettered only by the World Champion, Tigran Petrosian.

At the Leipzig 1960 Olympiad, he defeated then-World Champion Mikhail Tal with the white pieces in a Modern Benoni:This victory made Penrose the first British player to beat a reigning world champion since Joseph Henry Blackburne defeated Emanuel Lasker in 1899.

== Correspondence chess ==
Penrose&#x27;s over the board performance started to decline in the 1970s and he fainted at the 1970 Olympiad in the midst of a tense game. Consequently, he moved on to correspondence chess, where he was successful, earning the International Master (IMC) title in 1980 and the grandmaster (GMC) title in 1983. He led his country to victory in the 9th Correspondence Olympiad (1982–1987).

==Personal life==
Penrose was the son of Margaret Leathes and Lionel Penrose, a professor of genetics, the grandson of the physiologist John Beresford Leathes, and brother of Roger Penrose, Oliver Penrose, and Shirley Hodgson. He was a psychologist and university lecturer by profession, with a PhD. He had two daughters from his marriage to Margaret Wood. 

Penrose was awarded the OBE in 1971.

He died on 30 November 2021, at the age of 88.

<doc id="428571" wikidata="Q6000597" url="?curid=428571" title="Illustration of the central limit theorem">
<text>In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that, in many situations, when independent and identically distributed random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution. This article gives two illustrations of this theorem. Both involve the sum of independent and identically-distributed random variables and show how the probability distribution of the sum approaches the normal distribution as the number of terms in the sum increases.

The first illustration involves a continuous probability distribution, for which the random variables have a probability density function. The second illustration, for which most of the computation can be done by hand, involves a discrete probability distribution, which is characterized by a probability mass function.

==Illustration of the continuous case==
The density of the sum of two independent real-valued random variables equals the convolution of the density functions of the original variables.

Thus, the density of the sum of &quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot; terms of a sequence of independent identically distributed variables equals the convolution of the densities of the sums of &quot;m&quot; terms and of &quot;n&quot; term. In particular, the density of the sum of &quot;n&quot;+1 terms equals the convolution of the density of the sum of &quot;n&quot; terms with the original density (the &quot;sum&quot; of 1 term).

A probability density function is shown in the first figure below. Then the densities of the sums of two, three, and four independent identically distributed variables, each having the original density, are shown in the following figures.
If the original density is a piecewise polynomial, as it is in the example, then so are the sum densities, of increasingly higher degree. Although the original density is far from normal, the density of the sum of just a few variables with that density is much smoother and has some of the qualitative features of the normal density.

The convolutions were computed via the discrete Fourier transform. A list of values &quot;y&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0 + &quot;k&quot; Δ&quot;x&quot;) was constructed, where &quot;f&quot; is the original density function, and Δ&quot;x&quot; is approximately equal to 0.002, and &quot;k&quot; is equal to 0 through 1000. The discrete Fourier transform &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;y&quot; was computed. Then the convolution of &quot;f&quot; with itself is proportional to the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the pointwise product of &quot;Y&quot; with itself.


===Original probability density function===

We start with a probability density function. This function, although discontinuous, is far from the most pathological example that could be created. It is a piecewise polynomial, with pieces of degrees 0 and 1. The mean of this distribution is 0 and its standard deviation is 1.

===Probability density function of the sum of two terms===

Next we compute the density of the sum of two independent variables, each having the above density. 
The density of the sum is the convolution of the above density with itself.

The sum of two variables has mean 0.
The density shown in the figure at right has been rescaled by formula_1, so that its standard deviation is 1.

This density is already smoother than the original.
There are obvious lumps, which correspond to the intervals on which the original density was defined.


===Probability density function of the sum of three terms===

We then compute the density of the sum of three independent variables, each having the above density. 
The density of the sum is the convolution of the first density with the second.

The sum of three variables has mean 0.
The density shown in the figure at right has been rescaled by , so that its standard deviation is 1.

This density is even smoother than the preceding one.
The lumps can hardly be detected in this figure.


===Probability density function of the sum of four terms===

Finally, we compute the density of the sum of four independent variables, each having the above density. 
The density of the sum is the convolution of the first density with the third (or the second density with itself).

The sum of four variables has mean 0.
The density shown in the figure at right has been rescaled by , so that its standard deviation is 1.

This density appears qualitatively very similar to a normal density.
No lumps can be distinguished by the eye.

==Illustration of the discrete case==
This section illustrates the central limit theorem via an example for which the computation can be done quickly by hand on paper, unlike the more computing-intensive example of the previous section.

===Original probability mass function===
Suppose the probability distribution of a discrete random variable &quot;X&quot; puts equal weights on 1, 2, and 3:

:formula_2

The probability mass function of the random variable &quot;X&quot; may be depicted by the following bar graph:
Clearly this looks nothing like the bell-shaped curve of the normal distribution. Contrast the above with the depictions below.

===Probability mass function of the sum of two terms===
Now consider the sum of two independent copies of &quot;X&quot;:

:formula_3

The probability mass function of this sum may be depicted thus:

This still does not look very much like the bell-shaped curve, but, like the bell-shaped curve and unlike the probability mass function of &quot;X&quot; itself, it is higher in the middle than in the two tails.

===Probability mass function of the sum of three terms===
Now consider the sum of &quot;three&quot; independent copies of this random variable:

:formula_4

The probability mass function of this sum may be depicted thus:

Not only is this bigger at the center than it is at the tails, but as one moves toward the center from either tail, the slope first increases and then decreases, just as with the bell-shaped curve.

The degree of its resemblance to the bell-shaped curve can be quantified as follows. Consider

:Pr(&quot;X&quot;1 + &quot;X&quot;2 + &quot;X&quot;3 ≤ 7) = 1/27 + 3/27 + 6/27 + 7/27 + 6/27 = 23/27 = 0.85185... .

How close is this to what a normal approximation would give? It can readily be seen that the expected value of &quot;Y&quot; = &quot;X&quot;1 + &quot;X&quot;2 + &quot;X&quot;3 is 6 and the standard deviation of &quot;Y&quot; is the square root of 2. Since &quot;Y&quot; ≤ 7 (weak inequality) if and only if &quot;Y&quot; &lt; 8 (strict inequality), we use a continuity correction and seek

:formula_5

where &quot;Z&quot; has a standard normal distribution. The difference between 0.85185... and 0.85558... seems remarkably small when it is considered that the number of independent random variables that were added was only three.

===Probability mass function of the sum of 1,000 terms===

The following image shows the result of a simulation based on the example presented in this page. The extraction from the uniform distribution is repeated 1,000 times, and the results are summed.

Since the simulation is based on the Monte Carlo method, the process is repeated 10,000 times. The results shows that the distribution of the sum of 1,000 uniform extractions resembles the bell-shaped curve very well.

<text>IC 10 is an irregular galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. It was discovered by Lewis Swift in 1887 and in 1935 Nicholas Mayall became the first to suggest that the object is extragalactic. Edwin Hubble suspected it might belong to the Local Group of galaxies, but its status remained uncertain for decades. The radial velocity of IC 10 was measured in 1962, and it was found to be approaching the Milky Way at approximately 350 km/s, strengthening the evidence for its membership in the Local Group. Its membership in the group was finally confirmed in 1996 by direct measurements of its
distance based on observations of Cepheids; most estimates place the galaxy 2–3 million light years from Earth, with some estimates ranging from 1.5–4.5 million light years. Despite its closeness, the galaxy is rather difficult to study because it lies near the plane of the Milky Way and is therefore 
heavily obscured by interstellar matter.

The apparent distance between IC 10 and the Andromeda Galaxy is about the same as the apparent distance between the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy, which suggests that IC 10 may belong to the M31 subgroup.

IC 10 is the only known starburst galaxy in the Local Group of galaxies; it has many more Wolf–Rayet stars per square kiloparsec (5.1 stars/kpc2) than the Large Magellanic Cloud (2.0 stars/kpc2) or the Small Magellanic Cloud (0.9 stars/kpc2). Although the galaxy has a luminosity similar to the SMC, it is considerably smaller, with an estimated diameter of around 5000 light years. Its higher metallicity compared to the SMC suggests that star formation activity has continued for a longer time period. The H II regions in IC 10 have all formed recently, within the last 10 Myr. The evolutionary status of the Wolf–Rayet stars suggests that they all formed in a relatively short timespan. The ratio between the two types of Wolf–Rayet stars (WC stars and WN stars) in IC 10 is very different from the ratio in other galaxies in the Local Group, which may be somehow due to the starburst nature of the galaxy. Currently, the galaxy produces stars at the rate of 0.04–0.08 solar masses per year, which means that the gas supply in the galaxy can last for only a few billion years longer.

Observations of IC 10 in the far-infrared show that the dust in this mild starburst galaxy is deficient in small grains. It is hypothesized that any small grains that formerly existed were destroyed by strong ultraviolet radiation in the areas around the hot luminous stars that were formed in the galaxy&#x27;s recent burst of star formation.

The galaxy has a huge envelope of hydrogen gas, with an apparent size measuring 68 × 80, which is far larger than the apparent size of the galaxy in visible light (5.5 × 7.0). IC 10 is also unusual in the respect that the visible part of the galaxy seems to rotate in a different direction than the outer envelope. It has an H II nucleus.

<text>Left Turn was a bimonthly activist news magazine that focused on international social justice movements. Based in New York City and produced by an all volunteer editorial collective, the magazine promoted anti-imperialism and anti-authoritarianism.

&quot;Left Turn&quot; had its roots in the anti-capitalist wing of the Global Justice Movement and was founded in the wake of the anti-WTO protests in Seattle in 1999 by a small group of socialists.

The magazine&#x27;s tagline, &quot;Notes from the Global Intifada&quot;, was inspired by the then ongoing Palestinian intifada. The magazine supported grassroots activists with the Palestine Solidarity Movement. The magazine ceased print publication after the August 2011 issue, but continues to operate a website.

<text>A starburst galaxy is one undergoing an exceptionally high rate of star formation, as compared to the long-term average rate of star formation in the galaxy, or the star formation rate observed in most other galaxies.

For example, the star formation rate of the Milky Way galaxy is approximately 3 M☉/yr, while starburst galaxies can experience star formation rates of 100 M☉/yr or more. In a starburst galaxy, the rate of star formation is so large that the galaxy consumes all of its gas reservoir, from which the stars are forming, on a timescale much shorter than the age of the galaxy. As such, the starburst nature of a galaxy is a phase, and one that typically occupies a brief period of a galaxy&#x27;s evolution. The majority of starburst galaxies are in the midst of a merger or close encounter with another galaxy. Starburst galaxies include M82, NGC 4038/NGC 4039 (the Antennae Galaxies), and IC 10.

==Definition==

Starburst galaxies are defined by these three interrelated factors:
# The rate at which the galaxy is currently converting gas into stars (the star-formation rate, or SFR).
# The available quantity of gas from which stars can be formed.
# A comparison of the timescale on which star formation consumes the available gas with the age or rotation period of the galaxy.

Commonly used definitions include:
* Continued star-formation where the current SFR would exhaust the available gas reservoir in much less time than the age of the Universe (the Hubble Time).
* Continued star-formation where the current SFR would exhaust the available gas reservoir in much less time than the dynamical timescale of the galaxy (perhaps one rotation period in a disk type galaxy).
* The current SFR, normalized by the past-averaged SFR, is much greater than unity. This ratio is referred to as the &quot;birthrate parameter&quot;.

===Triggering mechanisms===
Mergers and tidal interactions between gas-rich galaxies play a large role in driving starbursts. Galaxies in the midst of a starburst frequently show tidal tails, an indication of a close encounter with another galaxy, or are in the midst of a merger. Turbulence, along with variations of time and space, cause the dense gas within a galaxy to compress and rapidly increase star formation. The efficiency at which the galaxy forms also increases its SFR . These changes in the rate of star formation also led to variations with depletion time, and power a starburst with its own galactic mechanisms rather than merging with another galaxy. Interactions between galaxies that do not merge can trigger unstable rotation modes, such as the bar instability, which causes gas to be funneled towards the nucleus and ignites bursts of star formation near the galactic nucleus. It has been shown that there is a strong correlation between the lopsidedness of a galaxy and the youth of its stellar population, with more lopsided galaxies having younger central stellar populations. As lopsidedness can be caused by tidal interactions and mergers between galaxies, this result gives further evidence that mergers and tidal interactions can induce central star formation in a galaxy and drive a starburst.

===Types===
Classifying types of starburst galaxies is difficult since starburst galaxies do not represent a specific type in and of themselves. Starbursts can occur in disk galaxies, and irregular galaxies often exhibit knots of starburst spread throughout the irregular galaxy. Nevertheless, astronomers typically classify starburst galaxies based on their most distinct observational characteristics. Some of the categorizations include:
* Blue compact galaxies (BCGs). These galaxies are often low mass, low metallicity, dust-free objects. Because they are dust-free and contain a large number of hot, young stars, they are often blue in optical and ultraviolet colours. It was initially thought that BCGs were genuinely young galaxies in the process of forming their first generation of stars, thus explaining their low metal content. However, old stellar populations have been found in most BCGs, and it is thought that efficient mixing may explain the apparent lack of dust and metals. Most BCGs show signs of recent mergers and/or close interactions. Well-studied BCGs include IZw18 (the most metal poor galaxy known), ESO338-IG04 and Haro11.
** Blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCD galaxies) are small compact galaxies.
** Green Pea galaxies (GPs) are small compact galaxies resembling primordial starbursts. They were found by citizen scientists taking part in the Galaxy Zoo project.
* Luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs).
** Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). These galaxies are generally extremely dusty objects. The ultraviolet radiation produced by the obscured star-formation is absorbed by the dust and reradiated in the infrared spectrum at wavelengths of around 100 micrometres. This explains the extreme red colours associated with ULIRGs. It is not known for sure that the UV radiation is produced purely by star-formation, and some astronomers believe ULIRGs to be powered (at least in part) by active galactic nuclei (AGN). X-ray observations of many ULIRGs that penetrate the dust suggest that many starburst galaxies are double-cored systems, lending support to the hypothesis that ULIRGs are powered by star-formation triggered by major mergers. Well-studied ULIRGs include Arp 220.
** Hyperluminous Infrared galaxies (HLIRGs), sometimes called submillimeter galaxies.

* Wolf–Rayet galaxies (WR galaxies), galaxies where a large portion of the bright stars are Wolf–Rayet stars. The Wolf–Rayet phase is a relatively short-lived phase in the life of massive stars, typically 10% of the total life-time of these stars and as such any galaxy is likely to contain few of these. However, because the stars are both luminous and have distinctive spectral features, it is possible to identify these stars in the spectra of entire galaxies and doing so allows good constraints to be placed on the properties of the starbursts in these galaxies.

===Ingredients===

Firstly, a starburst galaxy must have a large supply of gas available to form stars. The burst itself may be triggered by a close encounter with another galaxy (such as M81/M82), a collision with another galaxy (such as the Antennae), or by another process that forces material into the centre of the galaxy (such as a stellar bar).

The inside of the starburst is quite an extreme environment. The large amounts of gas mean that massive stars are formed. Young, hot stars ionize the gas (mainly hydrogen) around them, creating H II regions. Groups of hot stars are known as OB associations. These stars burn bright and fast, and are quite likely to explode at the end of their lives as supernovae.

After the supernova explosion, the ejected material expands and becomes a supernova remnant. These remnants interact with the surrounding environment within the starburst (the interstellar medium) and can be the site of naturally occurring masers.

Studying nearby starburst galaxies can help us determine the history of galaxy formation and evolution. Large numbers of the most distant galaxies seen, for example, in the Hubble Deep Field are known to be starbursts, but they are too far away to be studied in any detail. Observing nearby examples and exploring their characteristics can give us an idea of what was happening in the early universe as the light we see from these distant galaxies left them when the universe was much younger (see redshift). However, starburst galaxies seem to be quite rare in our local universe, and are more common further away – indicating that there were more of them billions of years ago. All galaxies were closer together then, and therefore more likely to be influenced by each other&#x27;s gravity. More frequent encounters produced more starbursts as galactic forms evolved with the expanding universe.

==Examples==
M82 is the archetypal starburst galaxy. Its high level of star formation is due to a close encounter with the nearby spiral M81. Maps of the regions made with radio telescopes show large streams of neutral hydrogen connecting the two galaxies, also as a result of the encounter. Radio images of the central regions of M82 also show a large number of young supernova remnants, left behind when the more massive stars created in the starburst came to the end of their lives. The Antennae is another starburst system, detailed by a Hubble picture, released in 1997.

<text>Eleanor Fulton Laing, Baroness Laing of Elderslie, (; born 1 February 1958), is a British Conservative Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Epping Forest from 1997 to 2024. She served in the shadow cabinets of Michael Howard and David Cameron. From 2013 to 2024, Laing was a Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons and was the first female Chairman of Ways and Means from 2020 to 2024. She had one of the longest tenures in the speaker&#x27;s chair. She became a member of the House of Lords in 2024.

Laing stood down from the House of Commons at the 2024 general election and was appointed to the House of Lords. Having served as an MP for 27 years, she is one of the longest-serving female MPs in British history.

==Early life and career==

Eleanor Pritchard was born on 1 February 1958 in Paisley, Renfrewshire, and raised in the nearby village of Elderslie, where her father was a councillor. She was privately educated at St Columba&#x27;s School, an independent school. Laing graduated from Edinburgh University with Master of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees. She was the first female President of the Edinburgh University Students&#x27; Association. She worked as a solicitor in Edinburgh and the City of London.

At the 1987 general election, Laing stood as the Conservative candidate in Paisley North, coming second with 15.8% of the vote behind the Labour incumbent Allen Adams. 

In 1995, she sought selection for Southend West, but was narrowly defeated in the selection process by David Amess, the sitting MP for Basildon.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1997 general election, Laing was elected to Parliament as MP for Epping Forest with 45.5% of the vote and a majority of 5,252. 

Following the election, she was selected for the Education Select Committee, chaired by Labour&#x27;s Margaret Hodge. Once in Parliament, Laing signed up to the Eurosceptic wing of the party, first supporting Michael Howard then William Hague for the Conservative leadership.

Laing sponsored the motion for lowering the homosexual age of consent to 16 in June 1998, saying in Parliament that: &quot;Nothing that is being proposed tonight is in any way encouraging physical sexual activity among young people before they are sufficiently mature. It is nonsense to say that there cannot be equality between 16-year-old boys and 16-year-old girls. Young people need protection, but young people are not protected by being made into criminals&quot;. Labour MPs paid tribute for Laing for speaking against the majority view of the then Parliamentary Conservative Party, of whom 110 of their 165 MPs voted against the measure.

She has been an opponent of devolution, and criticised the Blair government on many of the details of the transfer of power. In December 2000, she was appointed as opposition Scottish spokeswoman. 

At the 2001 general election, Laing was re-elected as MP for Epping Forest with an increased vote share of 49.1% and an increased majority of 8,426.

Laing voted against the repeal of Section 28 in 2003.

Laing first entered the shadow cabinet in 2004 as Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities under the leadership of Michael Howard, after previously serving as Shadow Minister of Children from June to November 2003. Whilst continuing in this role, Laing became Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, serving briefly from May 2005, shortly after the 2005 general election, to December 2005 when David Cameron came to power as Leader of the Opposition. 

Laing was again re-elected at the 2005 general election with an increased vote share of 53% and an increased majority of 14,358. 

Laing continued as Shadow Women and Equalities Minister until a July 2007 reshuffle, when she became Shadow Minister for Justice, a role she remained in until the 2010 general election.

At the 2010 general election, Laing was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 54% and an increased majority of 15,131. After the election, and the formation of the Cameron–Clegg coalition, Laing did not receive a government post, thus returning to the backbenches. 

In 2012, Laing voted against the third reading of the proposed House of Lords Reform Bill 2012, and opposed a referendum on Scottish independence. She also spoke in favour of a referendum on the United Kingdom&#x27;s membership of the European Union, and paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher and her legacy during a Commons session dedicated to tributes to the late former Prime Minister, which took place shortly after her death.

Laing criticised the manner in which the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 was introduced by arguing &quot;social change should come about by evolution, not by diktat from the top of government&quot; and subsequently abstained from voting on it.

===Deputy Speaker (2013–2024)===

In May 2013, the First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means, Nigel Evans, was arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault. He was acquitted of those charges, but resigned from his position in the Chair on 10 September 2013. On 16 October, Laing was elected to succeed Evans as the First Deputy Chair, the holder of which post is one of the Deputy Speakers of the House. 

At the 2015 general election, Laing was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 54.8% and an increased majority of 17,978.

In January 2016, Laing criticised Tulip Siddiq, who was seven months pregnant at the time, for breaking the customs of the House by leaving a debate shortly after speaking. Siddiq had already been in the debate for two hours and left at 14:30 to eat. According to witnesses, Laing told Siddiq not to use her pregnancy as an excuse for her behaviour.

Laing voted leave in the 2016 Brexit referendum. 

At the snap 2017 general election, Laing was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 62% and an increased majority of 18,243. Laing was again re-elected at the 2019 general election with an increased vote share of 64.4% and an increased majority of 22,173, an election which she described as &quot;very nasty&quot;.

Laing stood in the 2019 Speaker election, to replace John Bercow, campaigning on restoring trust to the House of Commons. Laing was critical of Bercow, and called his impartiality into question, pledging to do things differently and bring kindness to the Speaker&#x27;s chair. Laing lost to Lindsay Hoyle, but declared her intention to stand to replace him as Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. She was elected by her fellow MPs, and became the first woman to be the Chairman of Ways and Means. 

Laing took a leave of absence from December 2022 after undergoing surgery, and returned to the chair during the week of 6 March 2023. Her leave of absence was extended to 31 March 2024, but Laing has continued in her duties in the Chair. Roger Gale served as deputy speaker while she was absent.

In June 2023, former prime minister Boris Johnson called for Bernard Jenkin to resign from his participation in the Commons Select Committee of Privileges, the Select Committee which investigated whether Johnson had misled parliament, when it was reported by the Guido Fawkes website that Jenkin had attended an event on 8 December 2020 in parliament. This was a &quot;drinks party&quot; held by Laing in her office, while such events were banned under the current guidelines. In November 2023, the police investigation into the &quot;drinks party&quot; attended by Laing was closed, with the &quot;threshold for fines not being met&quot;.

Since November 2023, she has been under investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Daniel Greenberg, for &quot;actions causing significant damage to the reputation of the House as a whole, or of its Members generally&quot;.

In May 2024, she announced she would stand down at the 2024 general election.

=== Peerage ===
After standing down as an MP, Laing was nominated for a life peerage in the 2024 Dissolution Honours. She was created &quot;Baroness Laing of Elderslie, of Epping Forest in the County of Essex&quot;, on 22 August 2024.

==Expenses==
After details of MPs&#x27; expense claims were released by the press in 2009 it was shown that Laing had avoided paying £180,000 capital gains tax on the sale of her Westminster flat by declaring it as her primary residence. This was due to its having a higher value than her constituency home, making it her primary residence under capital gains tax rules. However she had registered the flat as her second home with the Parliamentary Fees Office, and by doing so had claimed through her Additional Costs Allowance some of the interest due on her mortgage. Laing&#x27;s constituency is Epping Forest, which neighbours London and less than an hour&#x27;s journey by tube. When questioned, she said that prior to the sale of the flat she had sought the advice of her solicitor. Laing was cleared by the Legg Inquiry; nonetheless, she voluntarily repaid £25,000 as a &quot;moral gesture&quot;. As a result of the issue over her expenses, an unsuccessful attempt was made to deselect her by her constituency party, led by the Leader of Epping Forest District Council.

==Personal life==
Laing is divorced with one son, born in 2001.

Laing is a supporter of Rangers F.C., and is a vice-chairman of the Westminster Parliamentary Rangers Supporters&#x27; Club.

She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2018 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List.

<doc id="428586" wikidata="Q750179" url="?curid=428586" title="Norman Lamb">
<text>Sir Norman Peter Lamb (born 16 September 1957) is a British politician and solicitor. He was the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) for North Norfolk from 2001 to 2019, and was the chair of the Science and Technology Select Committee from 2017 to 2019.

Lamb was a candidate in the 2015 Liberal Democrats leadership election. He served most recently as Minister of State for Care and Support in the Department of Health, and previously as Minister of State for Employment Relations in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and earlier as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition Government.

==Early life and career==
Lamb was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, the son of climatologist Professor Hubert Lamb and the great-grandson of the mathematician Sir Horace Lamb. He went to Wymondham College in Norfolk, then the University of Leicester, graduating with an LLB.

Following his graduation, Lamb worked as a solicitor. He began to specialise in employment law whilst working for Steele and Co Solicitors (now called Steeles Law). His book, &quot;Remedies in the Employment Tribunal: Damages for Discrimination and Unfair Dismissal&quot; was published in 1998.

Lamb worked for a year as a researcher for Labour MP Greville Janner in the early 1980s. A meeting with Shirley Williams in Parliament at this time, shortly after the formation in 1981 of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), spurred Lamb into front line active politics and he was elected to Norwich City Council where he led the Liberal Democrat group until he stood down in 1991 in order to pursue his Westminster ambitions.

==Parliamentary career==

Having first stood for election at North Norfolk in 1992, when the Conservative majority was reduced, he came close to a major shock at the 1997 general election, when he reduced a Conservative majority of 12,545 to just 1,293 votes. He was finally elected in 2001, which was his third attempt for the seat; narrowly defeating the incumbent Conservative MP David Prior by 483 votes. He was re-elected in 2005 with a significantly increased majority of 10,606 votes, despite a campaign by the Conservatives and their candidate Iain Dale to unseat him in what was one of their foremost target seats. He was re-elected for a second time in 2010 with a majority of 11,626 votes.

Norman Lamb&#x27;s first appointment, after being elected, was as a Liberal Democrat spokesman on International Development. Soon after this, he was chosen by then party leader Charles Kennedy to act as his Parliamentary Private Secretary. Following the 2005 general election, Lamb was promoted and appointed Liberal Democrat Trade spokesman (2005–2006), securing the endorsement of the Liberal Democrat Spring 2006 Conference for a policy to partially privatise the Royal Mail, and to use the proceeds to invest in a publicly owned Post Office network. In March 2006, he moved to the post of Chief of Staff to the newly elected leader, Sir Menzies Campbell. In December 2006, he became the party&#x27;s Health spokesman and was succeeded by Ed Davey as Campbell&#x27;s Chief of Staff.

At the 2010 general election, Lamb was re-elected for a third time as MP for North Norfolk. Lamb secured a larger majority than before, both in percentage terms and in absolute votes. Following the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in May 2010, Lamb was appointed a Parliamentary Private Secretary to Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Nick Clegg.

On 3 February 2012, Norman Lamb was promoted to the role of junior minister in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills after Ed Davey was appointed Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change following the resignation of Chris Huhne consequent on his prosecution and resignation from Parliament.

In January 2015, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; highlighted a £497,000 grant to upgrade Sheringham railway station in Lamb&#x27;s constituency as an example of non-essential money being spent in marginal coalition constituencies ahead of the 2015 general election and accused the government of &quot;electioneering on the taxpayer&quot;. Lamb had announced the additional spend as &quot;fantastic news&quot; for the area, with Downing Street subsequently denying that either the funding or Lamb&#x27;s role in announcing the funding was linked to electoral objectives.

At the 2015 general election, Lamb was returned to Parliament with a significantly reduced majority. At the same election, the Liberal Democrats were reduced to just eight seats and lost their status as the UK&#x27;s official &quot;third party&quot;, having been overtaken by the Scottish National Party in terms of seats won. Nick Clegg resigned as Leader of the Liberal Democrats the following day, on 8 May. Lamb stood at the subsequent Lib Dem leadership election, where he lost to Tim Farron on 16 July. Lamb was re-elected at the 2017 general election with a majority of 6.7%, an election in which he served as Farron&#x27;s chief of staff.

On 12 July 2017, Lamb beat fellow Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson to become the Chair of the Science and Technology Select Committee by 343 votes to Swinson&#x27;s 222.

In April 2018, Lamb had a stroke which he attributed to long working days and not getting enough sleep. Shortly after the stroke, Lamb told the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; that &quot;There is no point killing myself. I&#x27;ve got to work smarter. When a doctor tells you about the importance of sleep you have to take notice ... I am kicking myself that I have allowed this to happen. I am determined to learn a lesson&quot;.

On 27 August 2019 Lamb announced he would not be seeking re-election and would stand down at the next UK general election.

In 2018 Lamb became Vice-Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Whistleblowing. On 24 October 2019 Lamb resigned from the group, writing to its secretariat &quot;I do believe fundamentally in transparency and accountability to the public who ask questions.&quot;

==Views==
Lamb has expressed concern that the number of GPs willing to work in deprived areas is falling and Lamb would like doctors paid a patient premium to work with poor patients. Lamb said, &quot;These figures [indicating a fall in the numbers of doctors working in poor areas] show a really disturbing trend, particularly given that low-income areas were already under-doctored before this latest fall took place&quot;.

===Brexit===
Lamb was also concerned over public spending cuts and a possible no-deal Brexit, writing on Twitter in 2018: &quot;Outrageous! A homelessness crisis, care for elderly &amp; disabled people close to collapse, funds for special needs children cut, people with mental ill health waiting far too long for treatment - and Gov spends billions on preparing for no deal Brexit which is completely avoidable!&quot;

Following the 2019 General Election, Lamb said that he &quot;largely fell out with the party in the period since the referendum&quot;, and that the party&#x27;s position of reversing Brexit had become &quot;more and more extreme&quot;. He left the Liberal Democrats in 2021.

===Medical transparency===
In his role as chair of the Science and Technology Committee, Lamb initiated measures that led to a significant improvement in medical research transparency in the UK.

===Cannabis legalisation===
Lamb has been an outspoken advocate for the legalisation of cannabis in the UK. In 2018 he introduced a Ten Minute Rule bill to legalise the drug, which was unsuccessful.

In 2019, as part of a BBC documentary, Lamb visited Canada and took cannabis oil, where it is legal.

==Personal life==
He married Mary in 1984, and they have two sons. They live in Norwich. Their son Archie Lamb was a co-founder of the independent record label Takeover Entertainment which promoted Tinchy Stryder.

Lamb was knighted in the 2019 Birthday Honours. He was appointed chair of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust in December 2019.

<text>David Lindon Lammy (born 19 July 1972) is a British politician who has served as Foreign Secretary since July 2024. A member of the Labour Party, he has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Tottenham since 2000. Lammy previously held various junior ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown between 2002 and 2010.

Born in Archway, Lammy attended The King&#x27;s School, Peterborough. He studied law at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London and was called to the bar in 1994. He later studied for a Master of Laws degree at Harvard University, becoming the first black Briton to study at Harvard Law School. In 2000, Lammy briefly served in the London Assembly before being elected to Parliament in the 2000 Tottenham by-election. Tony Blair appointed him Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health in 2002 and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs in 2003. He was promoted to Minister of State for Culture in 2005. In 2007, Gordon Brown appointed him Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills before Lammy served as Minister of State for Higher Education from 2008 to 2010.

Following Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 2010 general election, Lammy endorsed David Miliband in the 2010 Labour leadership election and subsequently declined to serve in Ed Miliband&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet. He then spent the next decade on the backbenches, and was a candidate in the 2015 London Labour Party mayoral selection but ultimately finished fourth. Lammy endorsed Keir Starmer in the 2020 Labour leadership election and was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Justice and Shadow Lord Chancellor in Starmer&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet. In the November 2021 Shadow Cabinet reshuffle, he was promoted to Shadow Foreign Secretary.

Following Labour&#x27;s victory in the 2024 general election, Lammy returned to government and was appointed foreign secretary by Starmer in his new government. He has supported Ukraine in its war against Russia and Israel in its war against Hamas.

==Early life and career==
David Lindon Lammy was born on 19 July 1972 in Whittington Hospital in Archway to Guyanese parents David and Rosalind Lammy. He and his four siblings were raised solely by his mother after his father left the family when Lammy was 12 years old. Lammy has spoken about the importance of fathers and the need to support them in seeking to be active in the lives of their children. He chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fatherhood, and has written on the issue.

Lammy grew up in Tottenham, and went to Downhills Primary School. At the age of 10, he was awarded an Inner London Education Authority choral scholarship to sing at Peterborough Cathedral and attend The King&#x27;s School, Peterborough.

Lammy studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, graduating with a 2:1 in law. He was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1994 at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He went on to study at Harvard University, where he became the first black Briton to attend Harvard Law School; he studied for a Master of Laws degree and graduated in 1997.

After Harvard, Lammy was employed as an attorney at Howard Rice (now part of Arnold &amp; Porter) in California from 1997 to 1998, and with D. J. Freeman (now part of Troutman Pepper Locke) from 1998 to 2000. He is a visiting professor of practice at SOAS.

==Parliamentary career==
In May 2000, Lammy was elected for Labour on the London-wide list to the London Assembly. Later in the same month, he was selected as the Labour candidate for the parliamentary constituency of Tottenham, following the recent death of the veteran member of parliament (MP), Bernie Grant. Lammy was elected to the seat in a by-election held on 22 June 2000 with 53.5% of the vote and a majority of 5,646. Aged 27, he was the youngest MP in the house at the time.

Lammy was re-elected as MP for Tottenham at the 2001 general election with an increased vote share of 67.5% and an increased majority of 16,916.

===Minister===

In 2002, he was appointed by Prime Minister Tony Blair as Parliamentary under-secretary of state in the Department of health. In 2003, Lammy was appointed by Blair as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Constitutional Affairs and while a member of the Government, voted in favour of authorisation for Britain to invade Iraq in 2003.

At the 2005 general election, Lammy was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 57.9% and a decreased majority of 13,034. After the election, Blair appointed Lammy as Minister for Culture at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.

In June 2007, new prime minister Gordon Brown demoted Lammy to the rank of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. In October 2008, he was promoted by Brown to Minister of State and appointed to the Privy Council. In June 2009, Brown appointed Lammy as Minister for Higher Education in the new Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, leading the Commons ministerial team as Lord Mandelson was Secretary of State.

===Opposition backbencher===
At the 2010 general election, Lammy was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 59.3% and an increased majority of 16,931. After Labour lost the election, Lammy returned to the backbenches, and a Labour Party leadership contest was announced. During the contest Lammy nominated Diane Abbott, saying that he felt it was important to have a diverse field of candidates, but subsequently declared his support for David Miliband. Following the election of Ed Miliband, Lammy pledged his full support but turned down a post in the Shadow cabinet, highlighting the need to speak on a wide range of issues that would arise in his constituency due to &quot;large cuts in the public services&quot;.

In 2012, Lammy pledged his support to Ken Livingstone&#x27;s bid to become the Labour London mayoral candidate in the 2012 London mayoral election, declaring him &quot;London&#x27;s Mayor in waiting&quot;. Lammy became Livingstone&#x27;s selection campaign chair. In 2014, Lammy announced that he was considering entering the race to become Mayor of London in the 2016 election.

Lammy was again re-elected at the 2015 general election with an increased vote share of 67.3% and an increased majority of 23,564. Following the party&#x27;s defeat, Lammy was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn, whom he is good friends with, as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015.

===London mayoral candidate===
On 4 September 2014, Lammy announced his intention to seek the Labour nomination for the 2016 mayoral election. In the London Labour Party&#x27;s selection process, he secured 9.4% of first preference votes and was fourth overall, behind Sadiq Khan, Tessa Jowell and Diane Abbott.

In March 2016, he was fined £5,000 for instigating 35,629 automatic phone calls urging people to back his mayoral campaign without gaining permission to contact the party members concerned. Lammy apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot; for breach of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. It was the first time a politician had been fined for authorising nuisance calls.

===Return to the frontbench===
At the snap 2017 general election, Lammy was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 81.6% and an increased majority of 34,584. At the 2019 general election, Lammy was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 76% and a decreased majority of 30,175.

Lammy endorsed Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner in the 2020 Labour leadership and deputy leadership elections. After Starmer was elected Labour leader in April 2020, Lammy was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Justice. In the November 2021 Shadow Cabinet reshuffle, Lammy was promoted to Shadow Foreign Secretary.

On 7 February 2022, while Lammy and Starmer were leaving Parliament, they were ambushed by a group of people who shouted abuse at Starmer including the words &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Savile&quot;. This followed Boris Johnson falsely blaming Starmer for the non-prosecution of Savile when Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions in the Crown Prosecution Service. Starmer was DPP in the years immediately prior to Savile&#x27;s death but there is no evidence he was involved in the decision to not have him prosecuted. Two people, a man and a woman, were arrested after a traffic cone was thrown at police officers. Johnson tweeted that it was &quot;absolutely disgraceful&quot; and thanked the police for acting swiftly. Shayan Sardarizadeh for BBC Monitoring said that the protest was an attempt to recreate the Ottawa &quot;freedom convoy&quot; protests in the UK, and noted that the activists&#x27; references to Magna Carta indicated that the protesters were members of the sovereign citizen movement. Julian Smith, the former chief whip, and Simon Hoare were among Conservatives who called for Johnson to apologise. MP Kim Leadbeater and Brendan Cox, the sister and husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, warned against politicians lending credence to far-right conspiracy theories. The following day, a Downing Street source said that Johnson still would not apologise for the slur against Starmer. Following the incident when activists forced police to protect Lammy and Starmer extremists issued multiple death threats against Starmer and other Labour MPs. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) sent material to the Metropolitan Police. Imran Ahmed of the CCDH stated, &quot;Every time a violent extremist makes a threat of violence and gets away with it, the norms of those groups worsen, and others are driven to newer depths of behaviour.&quot;

In August 2022, an inquiry found that he had inadvertently breached the MPs&#x27; code of conduct. He apologised in a letter to Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone.

On 19 November 2023, Lammy visited Israel and had a meeting with Israeli president Isaac Herzog and Foreign Minister Eli Cohen. That month, Lammy said an Israeli strike on a refugee camp could be &quot;legally justified&quot;. In January 2024, as he was giving a speech, he was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters.

In January 2023, Lammy visited Northern Ireland with Shadow Secretary Peter Kyle and Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jenny Chapman, visiting Foyle Port to make a statement on the Northern Ireland Protocol.

At the 2024 general election, Lammy was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 57.5% and a decreased majority of 15,434.

=== Foreign Secretary ===
Lammy was appointed foreign secretary by Starmer in his ministry on 5 July 2024. He took his first international trip as foreign secretary meeting his counterparts in Poland (Radosław Sikorski), Germany (Annalena Baerbock) and Sweden (Tobias Billström). These meetings involved matters including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel–Hamas war. Lammy stated that the UK government wanted to &quot;reset&quot; its relations with the European Union, with their plans including a new joint security pact covering defence, energy policies, the climate crisis, pandemic prevention and illegal immigration.

On 13 July 2024 Lammy condemned the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. Lammy had previously been critical of Donald Trump, calling him &quot;a tyrant&quot; and &quot;a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath&quot; in 2018. Following Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2024 United States presidential election, Lammy dismissed past criticism of Trump as &quot;old news&quot;.

On 14 July 2024, Lammy visited Israel and met with the families of Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip. He called for a ceasefire in Gaza that would be conditional on the release of all hostages. After receiving assurances of its neutrality, Lammy announced the resumption of British funding to the UNRWA, stating that the humanitarian situation in Gaza was &quot;desperate&quot; and &quot;no other agency&quot; could deliver aid on the scale needed.

Lammy promised to review the UK&#x27;s relationship with China. In August 2024, he refused to label China&#x27;s persecution of the Uyghur ethnic minority as &quot;genocide&quot;.

On 14 August 2024, he met Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud in London to discuss the growing UK–Saudi partnership. Lammy wrote on X: &quot;We&#x27;ll work together on shared defence, economic &amp; security interests, including pressing for de-escalation in the region and a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.&quot;

Lammy visited the Norwegian Joint Headquarters in Bodø together with his Norwegian counterpart, Espen Barth Eide, to discuss deepening defence and security ties with the country and tackling threats from Russia.

On 19 September 2024, Lammy sparked a diplomatic row with Armenia because of a reference to Nagorno Kharabakh conflict in his blog post. His remarks were described as &quot;callous&quot;, as he referred to what has been described as ethnic cleansing of the indigenous Christian population of the region as &quot;liberation&quot;, and &quot;ignorant&quot; because of parallels he drew between Azerbaijan (a dictatorship in allied relations with Russia) and Ukraine, which is fighting against Russia.

Following the UK&#x27;s decision to relinquish control of the Chagos Islands, Lammy asserted that this didn&#x27;t signal a shift in the government&#x27;s position on other overseas territories. He furthermore stated that the status of the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar were &quot;non-negotiable&quot;.

In November 2024, following the issuance by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on an arrest warrant against Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in Gaza, Lammy clarified that he considered there to be no discretion for him but to implement the warrant. His position contrasted with France&#x27;s view that Netanyahu benefited from immunity from the ICC.

==Political views==
===Crime===
Lammy has talked about black and minority ethnic people, in particular younger people, with regards to their relation with crime and how they are treated by the criminal justice system.

On 11 August 2011, in an address to Parliament, Lammy attributed part of the cause for England&#x27;s riots of a few days earlier to destructive &quot;cultures&quot; that had emerged under the prevailing policies. He also stated that legislation restricting the degree of violence that parents are allowed to use when disciplining their children was partly to blame for current youth culture, that had contributed to the riots.

In September 2017 Lammy stated that the criminal justice system deals with &quot;disproportionate numbers&quot; of young people from black and ethnic minority communities: despite saying that although decisions to charge were &quot;broadly proportionate&quot;, he asserted that black and ethnic minority people still face and perceive bias. Lammy said that young black people are nine times more likely to be incarcerated than &quot;comparable&quot; white people, and proposed a number of measures including a system of &quot;deferred prosecution&quot; for young first time offenders to reduce incarcerations. Lammy has claimed that black and ethnic minority people offend &quot;at the same rates&quot; as comparable white people &quot;when taking age and socioeconomic status into account&quot;; however, they were more likely to be stopped and searched, if charged, more likely to be convicted, more likely to be sent to prison and less likely to get support in prison.

In 2018, Lammy blamed the then-Prime Minister Theresa May, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan for failing to take responsibility over fatal stabbings in London. He also criticised inequality, high youth unemployment among black males, and local authorities cutting youth services and outreach programmes.

===Issues of race, prejudice and equality===

Lammy has commented on Britain&#x27;s history of slavery. He has also criticised the University of Oxford for admitting relatively few black students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds. He believes the Windrush scandal concerns injustice to a generation who are British, have made their homes and worked in Britain and deserve to be treated better.

On 5 February 2013, Lammy gave a speech in the House of Commons on why he would be voting in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, critically comparing the relegation of British same-sex couples to civil partnerships to the &quot;separate but equal&quot; legal doctrine that justified Jim Crow laws in the 20th-century United States.

In January 2016, Lammy was commissioned by then-Prime Minister David Cameron to report on the effects of racial discrimination and disadvantage on the procedures of the police, courts, prisons and the probation service. Lammy published his report in September 2017, concluding that prosecutions against some BAME suspects should be delayed or dropped outright to mitigate racial bias.

In the same month, Lammy said one million Indians sacrificed their lives during the Second World War for the &quot;European Project&quot;; the statement was criticised by &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

He has spoken out against antisemitism within the Labour Party, and attended an &quot;Enough is Enough&quot; rally. At the rally, Lammy stated that antisemitism has &quot;come back because extremism has come back&quot; and is damaging support for Labour among Britain&#x27;s Jewish community.

In January 2019, Lammy described Rod Liddle having a column in a weekly newspaper as a &quot;national disgrace&quot; and accused Liddle of having &quot;white middle class privilege&quot; for expressing the view that absent fathers played a role in violent crime involving black youths. Writing in an article for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Liddle disputed Lammy&#x27;s claim that he was raised in a family reliant on tax credits, which were not introduced in the United Kingdom until Lammy was aged 31. Lammy made the same argument – that absent fathers are a &#x27;key cause of knife crime&#x27; – in 2012.

Lammy recorded a Channel 4 documentary for Remembrance Sunday called &quot;The Unremembered: Britain&#x27;s Forgotten War Heroes&quot;, which was broadcast on 10 November 2019. In it he reveals how Africans who died in their own continent serving Britain during WWI were denied the honour of an individual grave, despite the Commonwealth War Graves Commission&#x27;s reputation for equality. The documentary was produced by Professor David Olusoga&#x27;s production company; Olusoga described the failure to commemorate black and Asian soldiers as one of the &quot;biggest scandals&quot; he had ever come across.

The documentary inspired an investigation by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The subsequent report found that &quot;pervasive racism&quot; underpinned the failure to properly commemorate service personnel. The report stated that up to 54,000 casualties of &quot;certain ethnic groups&quot; did not receive the same remembrance treatment as white soldiers who had died and another 350,000 military personnel recruited from east Africa and Egypt were not commemorated by name or even at all. In April 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson offered an &quot;unreserved apology&quot; over the findings of the review. Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace apologised in the House of Commons, promising to make amends and take action. Lammy, who was critical to bringing the matter to light, called this a &quot;watershed moment&quot;.

===Home Office security===
In October 2022, Lammy called for a full investigation into an alleged security breach by Suella Braverman. Lammy said: &quot;The home secretary is the most serious job you could have in our state. This is a person who makes judgements about terrorism and counter-terrorism, who makes judgements about very, very serious offenders, whether they should be allowed out of prison, and for that reason, it&#x27;s someone who, I&#x27;m afraid, judgement is critically important. I&#x27;m afraid this is a lapse of judgement that, quite rightly, she was sacked for. The question is, why was she brought back?&quot;

===Foreign policy===

Lammy is a staunch advocate of British membership of the European Union. On 23 June 2018, he appeared at the People&#x27;s Vote march in London to mark the second anniversary of the referendum to leave the European Union. The People&#x27;s Vote was a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union. On 30 December 2020, he voted for the Brexit deal negotiated by Boris Johnson&#x27;s Government.

In 2017, Lammy said the Rohingya people in Myanmar &quot;are facing genocide&quot;. In December 2021, he described the persecution of Uyghurs in China as &quot;genocide&quot;.

In April 2019, Lammy was criticised for saying his comparison of the European Research Group (which consists of Conservative MPs) to Nazis and proponents of the South African apartheid was &quot;not strong enough&quot;.

In late 2023, following an IDF bombing of the Jabalia refugee camp, Lammy commented that the strike was wrong &quot;when it comes to the ethics,&quot; but also that &quot;if there is a military objective it can be legally justifiable&quot;. The comments were criticised by the Muslim Association of Britain as shameful and morally depraved.

Lammy is a supporter of Israel. In September 2024, he described himself as a &quot;liberal, progressive Zionist&quot;. He opposed a full arms embargo on Israel. In October 2024, Lammy stated that describing Israel&#x27;s actions in Gaza as a genocide &quot;undermines the seriousness of that term&quot;, leading MP Chris Law to state the comment revealed Lammy&#x27;s &quot;blatant contempt for the fundamental rights and the very lives of Palestinians.&quot;

Lammy has stressed wanting to maintain a strong relationship with the United States. On a trip to Washington D.C. in May 2024, Lammy spoke at the Hudson Institute where he described himself as a &quot;good Christian&quot; and &quot;small-c conservative&quot; who had common cause with the U.S. Republican Party.

Lammy wrote in a Substack post in September 2024 that &quot;Azerbaijan has been able to liberate territory it lost in the early 1990s&quot; in reference to the 2023 Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh, which resulted in the exodus of the Armenian population. The Foreign Office clarified that his comment did not mark a change in the UK government&#x27;s stance on Nagorno-Karabakh, but Armenia asked for further clarification. Lammy description of the event was widely criticized. Conservative MP Alicia Kearns said Lammy&#x27;s comments are “totally inappropriate and throws into question the foreign secretary&#x27;s judgment”. US congressman Brad Sherman said the remarks were “a stain on UK foreign policy” and accused Lammy of having “endorsed ethnic cleansing”. Laurence Broers, a scholar of the Caucasus, called Lammy&#x27;s remarks &quot;poorly informed&quot; as Azerbaijan, in addition to recovering territory, &quot;enacted a sustained campaign aimed at cleansing the territory of its ethnic Armenian population—and succeeded.&quot; Elin Suleymanov, Azerbaijan&#x27;s ambassador to the UK, said Lammy&#x27;s remarks are &quot;absolutely true&quot;.

===Other views===

In Lammy&#x27;s book, &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot;, Lammy stated in reference to the 2011 England riots that, &quot;If parents were allowed to hit their children, the riots wouldn&#x27;t have happened&quot; and has said the ban on smacking children should be overturned.

Lammy described the Grenfell Tower fire as &quot;corporate manslaughter&quot; and called for arrests to be made; his friend Khadija Saye died in the fire. He also criticised the authorities for failing to say how many people had died. Reacting to the first official estimate of deaths, he said on 2 July 2017 &quot;We know that 80 people have lost their lives but the view amongst the victims – I spoke to them yesterday – is that many more lost their lives.&quot; The official death toll for the fire is 72. He has written about what he believes to be the shortcomings of the housing market.

Lammy supports shared parental leave, which he maintains would &quot;normalise&quot; fathers being an equal parent with the mother, and would mean they become more involved in the raising of children, arguing that the barriers to &quot;fathers playing a deeper role in family life&quot; are not just legislative, but also cultural. He points out Scandinavian countries such as Sweden as examples of where governments have successfully made this happen, which he states has also helped increase gender equality.

Lammy has called former Conservative Party Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher a &quot;visionary leader for the UK&quot; and that, &quot;You can take issue with Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s prescription, but she had a big manifesto for change and set about a course that lasted for over two decades&quot;.

=== Comic Relief ===
In 2017, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Lammy argued that Comic Relief perpetuated problematic stereotypes of Africa, and that they had a responsibility to use its powerful position to move the debate on in a more constructive way by establishing an image of African people as equals. His comments came after a video featuring Ed Sheeran meeting and rescuing a child in Liberia was criticised as &quot;poverty porn&quot; and was given the &quot;Rusty Radiator&quot; award for the &quot;most offensive and stereotypical fundraising video of the year&quot;. In 2018, in response to Lammy&#x27;s comments and the backlash to Sheeran&#x27;s video, Comic Relief announced they would take steps towards change by halting their use of celebrities for appeals.

In February 2019, Lammy criticised Stacey Dooley for photographs she posted on social media of her trip to Uganda for Comic Relief, and said that &quot;the world does not need any more white saviours&quot;, and that she was &quot;perpetuating &#x27;tired and unhelpful stereotypes&#x27; about Africa&quot;. He also stated however, that he does not question her &quot;good motives&quot;. The donations received for the Red Nose Day broadcast in March 2019 fell by £8 million and the money raised that year was the lowest since 2007, which some have blamed on Lammy&#x27;s remarks. Critics of his view included Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and Conservative Party MP Chris Philp. Lammy responded to criticism with a statement in which he referred to the decline in donations being due to contributing factors of austerity, declining viewing figures, trends in the charity sector and format fatigue and that he hoped his comments &quot;would inspire the charity to refresh its image and think harder about the effects its output has on our perceptions of Africa&quot;.

Following this, in October 2020, Comic Relief announced it would stop sending celebrities to Africa for its fundraising films. They stated that they would no longer send celebrities to Africa nor portray Africa with images of starving people or critically ill children, instead, they would be using local filmmakers to provide a more &quot;authentic&quot; perspective and give agency back to African people.

==Personal life==
Lammy married the artist Nicola Green in 2005; the couple have two sons and a daughter.

Lammy is an Anglican and is part of the liberal Anglo-Catholic tradition in the Church of England.

He is a Tottenham Hotspur F.C. fan.

He holds dual citizenship in the United Kingdom and Guyana. His great-grandmother was Indian, from Calcutta, who moved to Guyana as a labourer as part of the Indian indenture system.

Lammy features as one of the 100 Great Black Britons on both the 2003 and 2020 lists. He has regularly been included in the &quot;Powerlist&quot; as one of the most influential people in the UK of African/African-Caribbean descent, including the most recent editions published in 2020 and 2021.

In November 2011, he published a book, &quot;Out of the Ashes: Britain After the Riots&quot;, about the 2011 England riots. In 2020, he published his second book, &quot;Tribes&quot;, which explored social division and the need for belonging.

Lammy was a stand-in presenter on LBC and hosted a weekly Sunday show, from 10 am to 1 pm, between 2022 and April 2024.

During the 2019–2024 parliament, Lammy received the highest income on top of his MP&#x27;s salary among Labour Party MPs.

==Honours==

<text>Socialist Solidarity () is a Trotskyist organisation in the Czech Republic. It is part of the International Socialist Tendency.

It seems to have developed from a circle around a punk rock band which developed links with the British Socialist Workers Party.

In 1998 a group split from the organisation to form the Socialist Organisation of Working People.

At the end of the 1990s it was active mainly in anti-racist work, campaigning against the Republican Party. 
The group has been also deeply involved in INPEG, the umbrella group organising the protests against the IMF and the World Bank in Prague in 2000. This anti-capitalist protest was very successful, forcing the bankers to leave Prague one day earlier than planned.
It was also at the centre of the protests against the war in Iraq in 2003.
Socialist Solidarity is now campaigning mainly against the planned U.S. military radar base in Brdy, Czech Republic, through the initiative Ne základnám (&quot;&quot;No&quot; to the bases&quot;).
Recently it joined big initiative called ProAlt against Czech right-wing government cuts, privatisation and other &quot;reforms&quot;.

The group publishes a magazine called &quot;Solidarita&quot;, now issued monthly.

<doc id="428591" wikidata="Q333276" url="?curid=428591" title="Andrew Lansley">
<text>Andrew David Lansley, Baron Lansley, (born 11 December 1956) is a British Conservative politician who previously served as Secretary of State for Health and Leader of the House of Commons. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for South Cambridgeshire from 1997 to 2015.

Lansley was born in Hornchurch, Essex, and studied Politics at the University of Exeter. He worked in the civil service before entering politics. He ran the Conservatives&#x27; campaign in the 1992 general election while at the Conservative Research Department, and later was Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party at the 2001 general election.

Lansley was the Shadow Secretary of State for Health from 2004 until 2010, the Secretary of State for Health from 2010 until 2012, and Leader of the House of Commons from 2012 until 2014. As Health Secretary, Lansley was responsible for the government&#x27;s controversial Health and Social Care Act 2012. He announced his intention to stand down as an MP in 2015, and was awarded a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours. Following his career in Westminster, Lansley advised corporate clients on healthcare reforms, despite David Cameron&#x27;s pledge to close the “revolving door” between Whitehall and the private sector.

==Early life==
Born in Hornchurch, Essex, Lansley was educated at Brentwood School and the University of Exeter, gaining a BA in politics. In 1977 while at Exeter University, Lansley was elected President of the Guild of Students (Student Union), as a Tory Reform Group candidate. His father Thomas worked in a pathology laboratory, and became co-founder of the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine and President of the Institute of Medical Laboratory Scientists.

Before entering politics, Lansley had &quot;a promising career in the civil service&quot;. Lansley worked for Norman Tebbit for three years as his private secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry. This encompassed the period of the IRA&#x27;s 1984 Brighton hotel bombing at the Conservative Party Conference in which Tebbit was seriously injured. Lansley and others have been praised by Tebbit for their support at that time.

Lansley went on to become more fully involved in politics. In 1990, he was appointed to run the Conservative Research Department. He ran the Conservative campaign for the 1992 general election, which he describes as one of &quot;his proudest career achievements&quot; He suffered a minor stroke in 1992, initially misdiagnosed as an ear infection, but made a full recovery save for permanently losing his sense of &quot;fine balance&quot;.

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for political service in the 1996 New Year Honours.

==Member of Parliament==
Lansley sought to enter parliament and was selected for the South Cambridgeshire seat where he was subsequently elected as an MP in 1997. He immediately joined the House of Commons health select committee.

At the 2001 election, he again took on a strategy role as a Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party. As part of his duties Shadow Ministers had to clear the timing of their announcements with Lansley. He fitted them into a timetable known as the &#x27;Stalingrid&#x27;. The 2001 election was not a success for the Conservative Party, and its leader William Hague resigned shortly afterward. Iain Duncan Smith, the new leader, offered Lansley a position following election but he turned this down and, until Michael Howard became Leader, Lansley was a backbencher.

Lansley was appointed a Privy Counsellor on 13 May 2010.

==Shadow Cabinet==
Following Howard&#x27;s election as party leader, Lansley soon returned to the Conservative frontbench. He served as the Shadow Secretary of State for Health. In his post he developed policies centred on using choice to improve the National Health Service, and was author of a chapter in Dr Tempest&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;The Future of the NHS&quot;.

==Cabinet minister==
After becoming Prime Minister in May 2010, David Cameron named Lansley as Health Secretary in the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government. A tempestuous two years of proposed health reforms followed.

On 4 September 2012, Lansley was moved to the positions of Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons, which he retained until 14 July 2014. He was then replaced by William Hague, following Hague&#x27;s surprise resignation as Foreign Secretary, and retired from the Cabinet to the back benches, announcing the same day that he would not be seeking re-election to the House of Commons at the next election and would hope to find an international role. In the event, the election came on 7 May 2015, and until his appointment to the House of Lords in October Lansley was out of parliament.

===Proposed health reforms===

In November 2010, Lansley provoked controversy by factoring into public health related bills representations from fast food companies such as McDonald&#x27;s, KFC and processed food and drink manufacturers PepsiCo, Kellogg&#x27;s, Unilever, Mars and Diageo on obesity, diet-related disease and alcohol, said by campaign groups to be the equivalent of handing smoking policy over to the tobacco industry.

In January 2011, Ministers published the Health and Social Care Bill, detailing planned reforms that would pave the way for GP consortia to take over management of the NHS from primary care trusts. Prime minister David Cameron said &quot;fundamental changes&quot; were needed in the NHS. 

But doctors&#x27; leaders believed that GPs could simply have taken charge of PCTs instead, and achieved the same results. The reforms were intended to pave the way for groups of GPs to take control of NHS budgets, with the consortia to take charge in 2013 of about 80% of the funding and of planning and buying everything, from community health centres to hospital services. However, some specialist services such as neurosurgery would be provided by a national board.

In a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, British Medical Association chairman Hamish Meldrum, Royal College of Nursing chief executive Peter Carter, and the heads of the Unison and Unite unions, said the speed and scale of the reforms proposed risked undermining the care of patients by putting cost before quality. Criticism of the reforms had been mounting ahead of the publication of the Health and Social Care Bill on 19 January 2011.

Lansley&#x27;s white paper on the NHS led to him being the subject of an unflattering hip hop track and video written by rapper NxtGen and poet Rob Gee, with the chorus &quot;Andrew Lansley, greedy / Andrew Lansley, / the NHS is not for sale, you grey-haired &quot;. It was picked up as one of the theme tunes to the anti-cuts movement and spawned placards at a March for the Alternative in March 2011. The video, partly paid for by Unison featured NxtGen rapping about Lansley&#x27;s proposed GP commissioning policy, his part in the parliamentary expenses scandal, and a controversial donation he had received from private health company Care UK. Lansley responded with a statement that he was &quot;impressed that he&#x27;s managed to get lyrics about GP commissioning into a rap&quot;, but stated &quot;We will never privatise the NHS&quot;.

Following the widespread criticism, on 4 April 2011, the Government announced a &quot;pause&quot; in the progress of the Health and Social Care Bill to allow the government to &#x27;listen, reflect and improve&#x27; on the proposals.

In November 2011, Lansley faced more criticism when he appeared speaking on a video played at NHS patients&#x27; bedside in England, the continuous loop video was played to patients as the main free content on the Hospedia system. When asked by Tom Blenkinsop , Lansley replied that he received no payment and there was no cost to the taxpayer.

On 13 April 2011, 96 per cent of 497 delegates at the Royal College of Nursing conference backed a motion of no confidence questioning Andrew Lansley&#x27;s handling of NHS reforms in England. Later that day, Lansley met with 65 nurses at the same conference, and apologised by saying &quot;I am sorry if what I&#x27;m setting out to do hasn&#x27;t communicated itself.&quot; 

In May 2012, Lansley appeared at the Royal College of Nursing annual conference where he stated that although &quot;the number of qualified nurses has gone down by nearly 3,000... clinical staffing levels overall have gone up by nearly 4,000&quot;. His comments at the conference were met with uproar from nurses and union members in the audience with heckling and some shouting &quot;liar&quot;. The Royal College&#x27;s general secretary, Dr Peter Carter criticised the health secretary&#x27;s claim as being &quot;nonsense that there&#x27;s more clinical staff than there was two years ago is just incorrect&quot; and later told the health secretary that currently &quot;There is a great deal of unhappiness&quot; amongst nurses and health care professionals, with a standing ovation from the audience.

On 28 June 2012, doctors meeting at a British Medical Association conference voted in favour of calling for Andrew Lansley&#x27;s resignation. 

Doctors voted in agreement of a motion stating &quot;This meeting has no confidence in Andrew Lansley, the Secretary of State for Health, and calls for him to resign&quot;. In the meeting, Lansley was accused by the BMA of &quot;breaching doctors&#x27; trust&quot; over pension agreements, and was accused by Dr Gary Marlowe who tabled the motion that &quot;during the election he (Lansley) misled the public and the profession&quot; regarding the Health and Social Care Bill. Before voting, Marlowe also stated that &quot;The Bill went through a stunning number of amendments and revisions. I believe the most of any Bill. How can we trust someone with such a poor record with our NHS?&quot;

On 4 September 2012, Lansley was replaced in his role as Health Secretary by Jeremy Hunt, with Lansley becoming Leader of the House of Commons.

==Salt reduction==
In 2010, responsibility for nutrition policy was transferred to the Department of Health. As Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley was accused by the BMJ of allowing the food industry to stall progress in reducing salt content in food (subsequently restarted in 2014 by Anna Soubry with publication of new targets effective in 2017).

==Public behaviour==
===Suggested conflicts of interest===
Until December 2009, Lansley received £134 an hour from a firm of advertisers that represents clients such as Walkers Crisps, McDonald&#x27;s, Unilever, Mars and Pizza Hut; &quot;Private Eye&quot; suggests a link between these activities and Lansley&#x27;s desire to see a more lightly regulated food industry. The same publication suggested a similar link to a Department of Health report on red meat in which the only products listed in the report found to contain suitable amounts of red meat to merit a &quot;Good&quot; rating were a &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac&quot;, and a Peperami (manufactured by Unilever).

While in opposition as health spokesman, Andrew Lansley accepted a donation of £21,000 from John Nash, the chairman of private healthcare provider Care UK and founder of the private equity fund Sovereign Capital, which owns several other private healthcare companies, to help fund his private office, leading to allegations of a conflict of interest. Such companies stand to be the largest beneficiaries of Lansley&#x27;s bill passed by the Coalition and House of Lords to increase the use of private health providers within the NHS.

As reported February 2011, Lansley&#x27;s wife advised attendees at a business conference to &quot;establish positive relationships with decision-makers&quot;. Although staff members of Low Associates, the PR firm she runs, had food and drug companies among their clients before joining Low Associates, the firm denies it has any clients in the health sector.

Andrew Lansley&#x27;s wife, Sally Low, is the managing director of Low Associates. Sally Low denies that Low Associates is involved in lobbying and instead describes its activities as provision of &quot;strategic advice&quot; to clients. Low Associates helps people prepare before they give evidence to committees of MPs, and Sally Low has given speeches on improving lobbying skills, in which she said that lobbyists should &quot;establish positive relationships with decision-makers before you need their help&quot;. Lobbyist clients of Low Associates personnel have previously worked for a variety of companies including those with an interest in health, such as SmithKline Beecham, Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble.

===Recession===
Andrew Lansley wrote a blog entry on the Conservative Party website on 25 November 2008, which claimed the &quot;good things&quot; from a recession included people being able to spend more time with their families. He was later forced to apologise.

===Parliamentary expenses===
In the Parliamentary expenses scandal in 2009, Lansley was accused of &#x27;flipping&#x27;, or redesignating, his second home, after claiming for renovation of a rural cottage prior to selling it. It is claimed that he then &#x27;flipped&#x27; his second home designation to a London flat, and claimed thousands of pounds for furniture. Lansley responded to the claims by stating that his claims were &quot;within the rules&quot;. He owns a Pimlico property, but has claimed over £7000 for hotel stays.

==House of Lords==
Lansley was created a Life Peer, taking the title Baron Lansley, &quot;of Orwell in the County of Cambridgeshire&quot;, on 5 October 2015.

==Personal life==
Lansley married his first wife Marilyn Biggs in 1985 and they had three daughters. They divorced in 2001, and Lansley married Sally Low, with whom he has had a son and a daughter. Lansley&#x27;s wealth was estimated at £700,000 in 2009.

In April 2018, Lansley revealed that he has stage 3 bowel cancer. He has called for the government to widen the cancer screening programme on the NHS.

<text>Crassostrea is a genus of true oysters (family Ostreidae) containing some of the most important oysters used for food.

The genus was recent split in WoRMS, following the DNA-based phylogenies of Salvi &quot;et al.&quot; (2014 and 2017). Pacific species were moved to a new genus &quot;Magallana&quot;. &quot;C. zhanjiangensis&quot; became &quot;Talonostrea zhanjiangensis&quot;. The changes are not universally welcomed by oyster researchers, as &quot;C. gigas&quot; (now &quot;M. gigas&quot;) is &quot;one of the most researched species of marine invertebrate&quot;.

== Species ==
Extant species are:
=== Fossil species ===
Fossil species include:
* †&quot;Crassostrea alabamiensis&quot; 
* †&quot;Crassostrea ashleyi&quot; (syn. &quot;Ostrea arnoldi&quot;)
* †&quot;Crassostrea cahobasensis&quot; 
* †&quot;Crassostrea contracta&quot; 
* †&quot;Crassostrea cucullaris&quot; 
* †&quot;Crassostrea cuebana&quot; 
* †&quot;Crassostrea elegans&quot; (syn. †&quot;Cubitostrea elegans&quot; Deshayes 1832 or &quot;Crassostrea (Cubitostrea) elegans&quot;)
* †&quot;Crassostrea gigantissima&quot; – Giant fossil oyster
* †&quot;Crassostrea gryphoides&quot; 
* †&quot;Crassostrea hatcheri&quot; 
* †&quot;Crassostrea ingens&quot; 
* †&quot;Crassostrea kawauchidensis&quot; 
* †&quot;Crassostrea patagonica&quot; (syn. &quot;Ostrea ferrarisi&quot;)
* †&quot;Crassostrea raincourti&quot; 
* †&quot;Crassostrea titan&quot; (syn. &quot;Ostrea prior&quot;, &quot;O&quot;. &quot;andersoni&quot;)
* †&quot;Crassostrea transitoria&quot; (syn. &quot;Ostrea maxima&quot;)
* †&quot;Crassostrea wyomingensis&quot;

== Genetics ==
The genome of &quot;Crassostrea gigas&quot; (now &quot;Magallana gigas&quot;) has been recently sequenced revealing an extensive set of genes that enable it to cope with environmental stresses.

<text>Jacqueline Rita Lawrence (born 9 August 1948, Birmingham) is a politician in the United Kingdom. She was Labour Member of Parliament for the Welsh seat of Preseli Pembrokeshire, from 1997 until 2005.

==Early life==
Lawrence studied at Upperthorpe College in Darlington, and the Open University. She moved to Pembrokeshire in the 1970s and learnt Welsh in order to support her children through Welsh medium education.

Lawrence worked for the Trustee Savings Bank and became a member of Dyfed County Council Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority and the Pembrokeshire Police authority. She then became election agent for neighbouring MP Nick Ainger in the 1992 general election and leader of the Labour Group on Pembrokeshire County Council on its formation as a unitary authority before being adopted as Parliamentary candidate for the Preseli Pembrokeshire constituency.

==Parliamentary career==
Lawrence was selected to stand for election for Labour through an all-women shortlist, and became MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire in the 1997 election. She was a new Labour loyalist, working on environmental, rural and Welsh language issues. She was a member of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee from 1997 to 2001, and a member of the DTI Department of Trade and Industry Select Committee from 2001 until becoming a Parliamentary Private Secretary at the DTI to Jacqui Smith who was then Minister of State at the DTI. She was Chair of the Welsh Group of Labour MPs at Westminster from 2003 to 2004 and Chair of the Parliamentary All-Party Group for National Parks until leaving Westminster in 2005.

When supporting a government campaign aimed at reducing teenage pregnancy, she revealed that she had given birth to a daughter when she was 17, who was subsequently adopted. She was strongly anti-hunting with dogs and supported legislation to outlaw the practice in the UK.

Lawrence stood down from Parliament at the 2005 general election, at which the Preseli Pembrokeshire seat was gained by the Conservative&#x27;s Stephen Crabb.

==After Parliament==
In 2005, Lawrence was a founding signatory of the Henry Jackson Society principles, advocating a proactive approach to the spread of liberal democracy across the world, including when necessary by military methods.

==Personal life==
She married David Lawrence in 1968. They have two sons and one daughter.

<doc id="428599" wikidata="Q15967031" url="?curid=428599" title="Frightwig">
<text>Frightwig is an all-female punk rock band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1982 by Deanna Mitchell and Mia d&#x27;Bruzzi.

The current lineup of Frightwig consists of Deanna Mitchell, Mia d&#x27;Bruzzi, Tina Fagnani, and Rebecca Sevrin.

== History ==
Formed in San Francisco in 1982, Frightwig has produced several songs criticizing patriarchal norms. 

In an interview with SFGate, D’Bruzzi stated that the band&#x27;s name came from a slang word that was popular at the time, which meant, &quot;a woman who has been out drinking cocktails, and she started out looking pretty good. Then it’s just the end of the night. Her tights are ripped, her lipstick’s smeared. Mascara’s down the face, and she’s still tipsy.&quot;

Frightwig has released cult-favorite albums including Cat Farm Faboo (Subterranean Records 1984), Faster, Frightwig, Kill! Kill! (Caroline Records 1986), and the EP Phone Sexy (Boner Records 1988). Frightwig has had different lineups, including the addition of Eric Drew Feldman (Captain Beefheart, Snakefinger, Frank Black, Pere Ubu, PJ Harvey, Knife &amp; Fork), in 2012.

Throughout the 1980s, Frightwig toured America, Canada, and Europe, and opened for Butthole Surfers and Redd Cross.

On May 4, 2017, band member Cecilia Kuhn died of cancer. Her bandmates honored her wishes that Frightwig would not disband. In 2023, Mitchell, d’Bruzzi, Feldman, Sevrin returned with a new album, released on Label 51 Recordings. A collection of 11 songs (four of which were previously released) recorded with Kuhn on drums, vocals, and accordion and produced by Eric Drew Feldman.

== Legacy ==
Frightwig was a significant influence on the Riot grrl movement, inspiring Bikini Kill, Hole, L7, and Lunachicks. Courtney Love described seeing a Frightwig show on the same night as Jennifer Finch of L7 and Kat Bjelland of Babes In Toyland. She said they &quot;all decided to start bands the next day. They are the true grandmothers of riot grrl.&quot;

Frightwig has also influenced bands such as Melvins and Faith No More. Kurt Cobain wore a Frightwig T-shirt under his cardigan during Nirvana&#x27;s performance on MTV Unplugged.

<doc id="428603" wikidata="Q749980" url="?curid=428603" title="Edward Leigh">
<text>Sir Edward Julian Egerton Leigh (born 20 July 1950) is a British Conservative Party politician who has been serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Gainsborough, previously Gainsborough and Horncastle, since 1983. Parliament&#x27;s longest-serving MP since 2024, Leigh is styled Father of the House and, in July 2024, acted as a Temporary Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons.

Leigh has a reputation at Westminster for his independence of mind as a &quot;serial rebeller&quot;, who is prepared to vote against his own political party if it conflicts with his own principles. He was one of the original Maastricht Rebels and was reportedly sacked for organising Euro-rebels among ministers. In 2003 Leigh opposed military intervention in Iraq; he has since called for those who voted for the Iraq War, and are still seeking to justify their support for it, to be held to account.

He served as the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee from 2001 to 2010, investigating government waste and seeking value for money in public expenditure. Leigh stepped down at the end of the parliamentary session in 2010, it being customary for an Opposition MP to hold this post. Leigh was knighted in the Queen&#x27;s 2013 Birthday Honours for &quot;public and political service&quot; and has also been honoured by the French and Italian governments.

A prominent Roman Catholic politician and former President of the Catholic Union of Great Britain, Leigh has edited and authored three books: &quot;Right Thinking&quot; (1988); &quot;The Nation That Forgot God&quot; (2008); and &quot;Monastery of the Mind&quot; (2012).

==Early life and career==
Edward Leigh was born on 20 July 1950 in London, the son of a civil servant, Sir Neville Leigh , and his wife Denise &quot;née&quot; Branch. Sir Neville served in RAF intelligence during World War Two and was Clerk to the Privy Council between 1974 and 1984. The Leigh family hails from the Cheshire landed gentry family of West Hall, High Legh, descendants of the Egertons, earls of Bridgewater.

Leigh is a descendant of the family of the Roman Catholic martyr Blessed Richard Leigh who was hanged at Tyburn during the Reformation in 1588 for being a Catholic priest, and beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1929.

His maternal grandfather, Colonel Cyril Denzil Branch , was a nephew of Prince Nikolai Golitsyn, the last Prime Minister of Imperial Russia.

Leigh was privately educated at the Oratory School and the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle, before going up to University College, Durham, where he read history (BA) and was elected President of the Durham Union Society.

After graduating Leigh was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple and practised in arbitration and criminal law at Goldsmith Chambers (a barristers&#x27; chambers), then elected a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (FCIArb). He also served as an Army Reservist Trooper in the Honourable Artillery Company.

Leigh worked in the private office of Margaret Thatcher from 1976 to 1977 as a political secretary when she was Leader of the Opposition. Elected as a Councillor on Richmond Borough Council in 1974, Leigh was then elected to the Greater London Council, representing Richmond, from 1977 to 1981. He lost his GLC seat to the Liberal candidate, Adrian Slade by 115 votes.

==Parliamentary career==
Leigh first stood for Parliament at the October 1974 general election, when he unsuccessfully contested Middlesbrough, coming second with 24.4% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour Party MP Arthur Bottomley.

Leigh was elected to Parliament as MP for Gainsborough and Horncastle at the 1983 general election, winning with 50.9% of the vote and a majority of 5,067. He was re-elected as MP for Gainsborough and Horncastle at the 1987 general election with an increased vote share of 53.3% and an increased majority of 9,723.

A strong supporter of Margaret Thatcher, Leigh visited 10 Downing Street with fellow MP Michael Brown on the morning of Thatcher&#x27;s resignation as Prime Minister in 1990 to try to persuade her to carry on. Although Charles Powell advised them it was a forlorn task, they were nonetheless granted access to the Cabinet which was in process at the time. Leigh and Brown departed 10 Downing Street and walked down Whitehall back to the House of Commons reputedly with &quot;tears in their eyes&quot;. After Thatcher resigned, in the ensuing leadership election, Leigh supported Michael Heseltine, under whom he had served at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), preferring to support someone who had stabbed Thatcher in the front to those who had stabbed her in the back.

At the 1992 general election, Leigh was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 54% and an increased majority of 16,245.

Leigh served as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State under John Major&#x27;s premiership but was sacked in May 1993 over his opposition to the Maastricht Treaty. Whilst a Minister he was a keen advocate of privatisation of the Post Office. In the 1995 Conservative leadership election, Leigh supported John Redwood.

Leigh&#x27;s constituency of Gainsborough and Horncastle was abolished prior to the 1997 general election, and replaced with the new constituency of Gainsborough. At this election Leigh was elected, winning the seat with 43.1% of the vote and a majority of 6,826. He was re-elected as MP for Gainsborough at the 2001 general election with an increased vote share of 46.2% and an increased majority of 8,071.

From 2001 until 2010, Leigh served as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the principal parliamentary body auditing the Budget, investigating government waste and seeking value for money in public expenditure. During his two terms as chairman, the PAC took evidence on 420 separate government projects and programmes and was responsible for saving the taxpayer over £4 billion.

At the 2005 general election, Leigh was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 43.9% and a decreased majority of 8,003.

Leigh was President of the socially-conservative Cornerstone Group representing the views of over 40 Conservative Members of Parliament and was author of the group&#x27;s inaugural pamphlet &quot;Faith, Flag and Family&quot; in 2005.

In October 2006, Leigh was vocal in stating that after David Cameron became leader of the party, core supporters were drifting away from voting Conservative. Nonetheless, his effective chairmanship of the Public Accounts Committee led to the rejuvenation of his parliamentary career.

Early in 2008, as Chairman of the PAC, Leigh was embarrassed by relying on flawed Department for Transport (DfT) statistics to attack motorcyclists for tax evasion. Accusing 38% of motorcyclists of evading vehicle excise duty, he later apologised for this following the admission by the DfT that 95.5% of motorcycles are entirely legal.

At the 2010 general election, Leigh was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 49.3% and an increased majority of 10,559.

From 2010 to 2011, Leigh served as an Independent Financial Advisor to HM Treasury, appointed by George Osborne to bring external challenge to the development and implementation of a new financial management strategy for central government. He stood down in 2011, but was then reappointed to report directly to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on improving Parliament&#x27;s financial scrutiny of the Budget. He was a member of the Treasury Financial Reporting &amp; Advisory Board and, in 2010, Leigh became a delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, speaking regularly and serving on the Culture, Science, Education and Media Committee. Leigh also supported Boris Johnson&#x27;s call to George Osborne in 2011 for lowering the rate of taxation in the UK so as to assist its economic recovery following the credit crunch.

At the end of 2010 Leigh was offered but declined the British ambassadorship to the Holy See. Leigh, an Assembly Member of the Council of Europe, opposed further human rights legislation, as proposed by the European Court of Human Rights.

In 2011, Leigh was appointed Chairman of the Public Accounts Commission, the body which audits the National Audit Office.

In 2012, Leigh, together with a record number of fellow Conservative MPs, including numerous Privy Counsellors, successfully voted against the Coalition Government&#x27;s attempted railroading of House of Lords reform by limiting time for meaningful parliamentary debate on this major constitutional issue.

In September 2014, Leigh criticised the Government&#x27;s decision to allow mitochondrial replacement therapy to prevent the birth of the children with incurable diseases such as muscular dystrophy. These diseases affect up to 1 in 6,500 babies which Leigh stated could lead to people being &quot;harvested for their parts&quot; and a divide between what he referred to as &quot;the modified and the unmodified&quot;. The Department for Health asserted no genetic modification is involved.

In 2015, the French President François Hollande appointed him to the Légion d&#x27;honneur for his role as &quot;a bridge between our parliaments, our governments and our societies&quot;, as stated by Ambassador Sylvie Bermann at his investiture.

Sir Edward was again re-elected at the 2015 general election with an increased vote share of 52.7% and an increased majority of 15,449.

In March 2016, he joined three other Conservative MPs in &quot;talking out&quot; a Bill introduced by Green Party MP Dr Caroline Lucas, which aimed to reverse moves to privatise the NHS. By filibustering for three and a half hours, Lucas was left with just 17 minutes to present her Bill, which was subsequently shelved without a vote.

Leigh was again returned to Parliament at the snap 2017 general election with an increased vote share of 61.8% and an increased majority of 17,023. He was one of 21 MPs who, in March 2019, voted against LGBT-inclusive sex and relationship education in English schools.

Re-elected at the 2019 general election, with an increased vote share of 66.4% and an increased majority of 22,967, in August 2020, Leigh suggested that the UK take back Calais to prevent migrants seeking asylum by crossing the English Channel from France.

On 1 March 2022, Leigh praised Home Secretary Priti Patel&#x27;s &#x27;proportionate response&#x27; over admission of refugees into the UK from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Speaking in the Commons, Sir Edward urged the Government &quot;to listen to the voices of people from, for instance in Lincolnshire, where we feel we have done our bit in terms of migration from eastern Europe where we are under extreme pressure in terms of housing and jobs.&quot; Despite receiving criticism for these remarks by Labour councillors on Lincolnshire County Council, at the 2024 general election, Leigh was again re-elected, albeit with a decreased vote share of 35.6% and a decreased majority of 3,532.

Succeeding Sir Peter Bottomley as Father of the House after the election, in July 2024, Leigh was appointed a Temporary Deputy Speaker acting as Chairman of Ways and Means until Deputy Speakers for the new parliament were elected.

== Views ==
Leigh is a Roman Catholic, and maintains a personal blog called &quot;Thoughts from a Christian perspective&quot;. He is a Patron of the Latin Mass Society, which promotes the use of the 1962 form of the Mass. He supports socially conservative causes in Parliament to promote traditional family values, including introducing policies to reduce the tax burden on working families. He has argued for tightening of abortion law regarding human embryonic research.

He defended Section 28 and opposed the Civil Partnership Act 2004, voting against it in Parliament at its Second Reading. Leigh later proposed an amendment to extend the property and pension rights afforded by civil partnerships to siblings who had lived together for more than 12 years. This was opposed by many backers of the initial Bill, such as fellow Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncan, who dubbed it a wrecking amendment. He voted against recent amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill which has made permanent the permission for at-home medical abortions to take place.

Following an interim report on the connections between colonialism and properties now in the care of the National Trust, including links with historic slavery, Leigh was among the signatories of a letter to &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in November 2020 from the &quot;Common Sense Group&quot; of Conservative Parliamentarians. The letter accused the National Trust of being &quot;coloured by cultural Marxist dogma, colloquially known as the &#x27;woke agenda&#x27;&quot;.

Leigh identifies as a socially Conservative Thatcherite and believes in &quot;free enterprise, deregulation, low taxation and a smaller state&quot;. In June 2018 he suggested reforming the National Health Service, stating: &quot;I personally feel we have to look at social insurance, which they have in France and Germany, because there is no room for increases in general taxation.&quot;

During the COVID lockdown, Leigh advocated for keeping churches open for worship, arguing that there was no scientific evidence to justify a total ban on public worship.

In June 2023, Leigh, along with Conservative MPs Sir Christopher Chope and Ian Liddell-Grainger, were photographed with the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán at a gathering of the European Conservatives Group and Democratic Alliance, an increasingly populist block in the Council of Europe&#x27;s parliamentary assembly. Christine Jardine, Cabinet spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, condemned the image, stating: &quot;Conservative MPs should not be cosying up to a far-right leader who has enforced homophobic and anti-democratic policies.&quot;

In November 2024, Leigh co-wrote a piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot; with Labour MP Diane Abbott opposing Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) on Assisted Suicide Bill.

===Opposition to Conservative leadership===
On a number of occasions Leigh has voted against the leadership of his party where it conflicts with his personal principles. In 2003, Leigh rebelled against the leadership of his own party and the Labour government to oppose military intervention in Iraq in 2003. He was one of only 15 Conservative rebels who opposed it at the time.

Since the 2016 European Union Referendum, Leigh has supported Brexit.

In October 2017, the House of Commons overwhelmingly passed an Opposition motion to delay the introduction of Universal Credit and iron out problems with the system first. Leigh strongly criticised the Government decision to ignore the vote, stating: &quot;the road to tyranny is paved by executives ignoring parliaments.&quot;

===Speakership elections===
A veteran backbencher, Leigh was encouraged to run for the speakership of the House of Commons, and after the 2010 general election for one of the Deputy Speakerships, but chose not to stand then as parliamentary convention was that governing party members were not to be elected to such offices unless already &quot;in situ&quot;.

Leigh ran for the speakership of the House of Commons in 2019 after Speaker John Bercow retired; he stated that, if elected Speaker, he would be fair to all sides and assume a traditional role. He was eliminated after receiving 12 votes in the first ballot.

===All-Party Parliamentary Groups===
Fluent in French, Leigh currently serves as Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on France and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Italy, delivering a speech in Italian at the Palace of Westminster to visiting Deputies of the Italian Parliament. He is also the Chairman of the new All-Party Parliamentary Group on Russia, Secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Insurance, and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs, Defence, and International Development subcommittee of the 1922 Committee.

==Honours==

Leigh received the accolade of the Realm for &quot;public and political service&quot;:
* Knight Bachelor (2013)
* Officier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur (2015)
* Commander of the Order of the Star of Italy (2017)
* Knight of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (1994)
* Privy Counsellor (13 February 2019).

==Personal life==
Leigh married Mary Goodman in London on 25 September 1984, the granddaughter of Countess Maria von Carlow and great-granddaughter of Duke Georg Alexander of Mecklenburg-Strelitz through her mother, and the great-grandchild of the Arts patron Lady Ottoline Morrell and British politician Philip Morrell, through her father.

Sir Edward and Lady Leigh have six children (Natalia, Tamara, Benedict, Marina, Nicholas, and Theodore) and divide their time between homes in Westminster and his Lincolnshire constituency. Their three eldest children work for HM Government as civil servants. The family are parishioners at the Brompton Oratory and Westminster Cathedral in London and members of the Serpentine Swimming Club.

Suffering from the skin condition rosacea, Sir Edward spoke out in March 2020 about being mocked on social media for his appearance.

<text>The International Socialists ()da is a Trotskyist organisation in Denmark. 

IS was set up in 1984 as split from the Left Socialists. It is part of the International Socialist Tendency led by the British Socialist Workers Party. The International Socialists are mainly involved in activities aiming at organising students. When ATTAC was founded in Denmark, IS worked with the organisation. Later on IS members pulled out of ATTAC claiming that the organisation had no substance. As an organisation closely connected to the British Socialist Workers Party IS has a similar, if not identical approach on the Iraq issue, i.e. giving the various resistance movements of Iraq unconditional but tactical support. The Danish media has attracted attention on IS because of this issue. 

In 1992, its office in the capital was attacked and one of its members was killed as a result.

At its congress in March 2006 IS decided to collectively join the broader Red-Green Alliance. IS will however maintain its own organisation and keep publishing its monthly &quot;Socialistisk Arbejderavis&quot;. On 18 January 2015 the IS decided to leave the Red-Green Alliance.

<text>Christopher Michael Leslie (born 28 June 1972) is a British business executive and former politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Shipley from 1997 to 2005 and Nottingham East from 2010 to 2019. A former member of the Labour Party, he defected to form Change UK and later became an independent politician.

Born in Keighley, Leslie was educated at Bingley Grammar School and graduated from the University of Leeds with a Bachelor of Arts in Politics and Parliamentary Studies and a Master of Arts in Industrial and Labour Studies. After working as an office administrator and political researcher, he was elected to Parliament for Shipley aged 24 at the 1997 general election.

Leslie was a minister in the Department for Constitutional Affairs from 2001 to 2005 but lost his seat at the 2005 general election. He was director of the New Local Government Network think-tank from 2005 until being elected for Nottingham East at the 2010 general election.

Between May and September 2015, Leslie served as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in the shadow cabinet of acting Labour leader Harriet Harman. In 2018, he lost a motion of no confidence by his constituency party. In February 2019, Leslie left Labour alongside six other MPs in protest at the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn to form The Independent Group, later Change UK.

==Early life (1972–1997)==
Leslie was born in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire, and attended Bingley Grammar School before becoming a student at the University of Leeds, graduating in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts in Politics and Parliamentary Studies. From 1994 to 1996, he was an office administrator and gained a Master of Arts in Industrial and Labour Studies in 1996, afterwards becoming a political research assistant in Bradford. He was elected to Parliament a month before his 25th birthday.

==Parliamentary career==
===In Parliament (1997–2005)===
At the age of 25, Leslie gained the seat of Shipley as a Labour Co-operative candidate in the 1997 general election defeating Marcus Fox, the chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee and Shipley&#x27;s Conservative MP since 1970. In the process, Leslie overturned a 12,382 majority, to return a 2,966 majority of his own. It was the neighbouring seat to his hometown of Keighley, another seat taken by Labour from the Conservatives in 1997.

Leslie was the Baby of the House when he first entered the Commons, remaining so until June 2000 when David Lammy, three weeks Leslie&#x27;s junior, was elected. He was appointed Parliamentary private secretary to Lord Falconer for three-and-a-half years. Leslie held his seat in 2001, but his majority was reduced by a half to 1,428.

Shortly before his 30th birthday, he became a junior minister in the Cabinet Office in 2001, following the recent election. In 2002, he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. He then moved to spend almost two years as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, working again under Falconer from 2003 to 2005. He never rebelled against a Government position during his first time in Parliament including voting in favour of the invasion of Iraq in March 2003.

In the 2005 general election, Leslie lost his seat to Conservative candidate Philip Davies, by fewer than 500 votes.

===Out of Parliament (2005–10)===
Leslie led Gordon Brown&#x27;s successful (and uncontested) campaign for the leadership of the Labour Party in 2007. Having lost his seat in Shipley, in 2005, he became the director of the New Local Government Network, which was described in the &quot;Local Government Chronicle&quot; in 2001 as a &quot;Blairite think-tank&quot;.

On 14 April 2010, he was selected as the Labour parliamentary candidate for Nottingham East in the general election campaign, after the National Executive Committee imposed a shortlist and selection panel, following the late resignation of the MP John Heppell.

===Return to Parliament (2010–2019)===
Leslie returned to Parliament at the 2010 general election, representing Nottingham East.

Leslie supported Ed Balls for the leadership of the Labour Party during the 2010 leadership election following the resignation of Gordon Brown, voting for David Miliband as his second preference.

In September 2011, he stood in the shadow cabinet elections but missed out on becoming a shadow cabinet minister, however he was promoted to Her Majesty&#x27;s Opposition becoming Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury. On 7 October 2013, he was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet, becoming Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. In May 2015, he was promoted to Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, replacing Ed Balls, who had lost his parliamentary seat in the 2015 general election. In this role he opposed Labour&#x27;s proposals for rent controls, while receiving income as a residential landlord himself.

Leslie supported Yvette Cooper in the 2015 Labour leadership election, and was critical of the economic policies of Jeremy Corbyn, calling them &quot;starry-eyed, hard left&quot;. On 12 September 2015, Leslie resigned from the Labour front bench following the election of Corbyn as party leader. Leslie is a supporter of Labour Friends of Israel and Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East.

In June 2018 Leslie published a pamphlet through the Social Market Foundation, where he is a member of the Policy Advisory Board, entitled &quot;Centre Ground: Six Values of Mainstream Britain&quot;. In August the same year &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that &quot;many saw the document as laying the intellectual groundwork for a future new [political] party,&quot; however Leslie denied this.

===Vote of No confidence===
In September 2018, Leslie lost a vote of no confidence brought by his Constituency Labour Party and became the fourth Labour MP to have such a motion passed against him. The motion, brought by members of the Mapperley branch of Nottingham East, criticised Leslie for his &quot;disloyalty and deceit&quot;, which it dubbed &quot;a severe impediment to Labour Party electability&quot;, and as &quot;incompatible&quot; with Leslie continuing as the Labour candidate. Leslie did not attend the vote and had earlier remarked that the party had been infiltrated by the &quot;intolerant hard left&quot;. Centrist Labour MPs rallied around Leslie online.

=== The Independent Group ===
On 18 February 2019, Leslie and six other MPs (Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey) quit Labour in protest at Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership to form The Independent Group, later Change UK. He continued to serve as a Change UK MP after six of its 11 MPs left the party in June 2019. He lost the Nottingham East constituency to the Labour candidate Nadia Whittome in the 2019 general election, losing his deposit with 3.6% of the vote.

==Life after parliament==
In July 2020, Leslie was appointed chief executive of the Credit Services Association, the trade association of the UK debt collection and purchase industry.

==Personal life==
In February 2005, he married Nicola Murphy, a special adviser to Gordon Brown, in Westminster; the couple became engaged the previous year. In April 2016, Nicola Murphy founded Labour Tomorrow, an organisation which funded Labour-connected activists and groups who oppose Jeremy Corbyn as party leader.

<text>The can-can (also spelled cancan as in the original French ) is a high-energy, physically demanding dance that became a popular music-hall dance in the 1840s, continuing in popularity in French cabaret to this day. Originally danced by couples, it is now traditionally associated with a chorus line of female dancers. The main features of the dance are the vigorous manipulation of skirts and petticoats, along with high kicks, splits, and cartwheels.

==History==

The can-can is believed to have evolved from the final figure in the quadrille, a social dance for four or more couples. The exact origin of the dance is obscure, but the steps may have been inspired by a popular entertainer of the 1820s, Charles-François Mazurier (1798–1828), well known for his mime and acrobatic dance, including the grand écart or jump splits—both popular features of the can-can; his greatest success was in &quot;Jocko, or The Brazilian Ape&quot; (1825).

The dance was considered scandalous, and for a while there were attempts to suppress it. This may have been partly because in the 19th century, women wore pantalettes, which had an open crotch, and the high kicks were intentionally revealing. There is no evidence that can-can dancers wore special closed underwear, although it has been said that the Moulin Rouge management did not permit dancers to perform in &quot;revealing undergarments&quot;. Occasionally, people dancing the can-can were arrested, but there is no record of its being banned, as some accounts claim. Throughout the 1830s, it was often groups of men, particularly students, who danced the can-can at public dance-halls.

As the dance became more popular, professional performers emerged, although it was still danced by individuals, not by a chorus line. A few men became can-can stars in the 1840s to 1861 and an all-male group known as the performed in London in 1870. However, women performers were much more widely known.

By the 1890s, it was possible to earn a living as a full-time dancer and stars such as La Goulue and Jane Avril emerged, who were highly paid for their appearances at the Moulin Rouge and elsewhere. The most prominent male can-can dancer of the time was Valentin le Désossé (Valentin the Boneless), a frequent partner of La Goulue. The professional dancers of the Second Empire and the fin de siècle developed the can-can moves that were later incorporated by the choreographer Pierre Sandrini in the spectacular &quot;French Cancan&quot;, which he devised at the Moulin Rouge in the 1920s and presented at his own Bal Tabarin from 1928. This was a combination of the individual style of the Parisian dance-halls and the chorus-line style of British and American music halls.

==Outside France==
Outside France, the can-can achieved popularity in music halls, where it was danced by groups of women in choreographed routines. This style was imported back into France in the 1920s for the benefit of tourists, and the &quot;French Cancan&quot; was born—a highly choreographed routine lasting ten minutes or more, with the opportunity for individuals to display their &quot;specialities&quot;. The main moves are the high kick or battement, the (quick rotary movement of lower leg with knee raised and skirt held up), the (turning on one leg, while grasping the other leg by the ankle and holding it almost vertically), the cartwheel and the grand écart (the flying or jump splits). It has become common practice for dancers to scream and yelp while performing the can-can.

The can-can was introduced in America on 23 December 1867 by Giuseppina Morlacchi, dancing as a part of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Auction&quot; at the Theatre Comique in Boston. It was billed as &quot;Grand Gallop Can-Can, composed and danced by Mlles. Morlacchi, Blasina, Diani, Ricci, Baretta ... accompanied with cymbals and triangles by the coryphees and corps de ballet.&quot; The new dance received an enthusiastic reception.

By the 1890s the can-can was out of style in New York dance halls, having been replaced by the hoochie coochie.

The can-can became popular in Alaska and Yukon, Canada, where theatrical performances feature can-can dancers to the present day.

==In other arts==
Many composers have written music for the can-can. The most famous is French composer Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s in his operetta (&quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;) (1858). However, the galop is actually another sort of dance. Other examples occur in Franz Lehár&#x27;s operetta &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1905) and Cole Porter&#x27;s musical play &quot;Can-Can&quot; (1954), which formed the basis for the 1960 musical film &quot;Can-Can&quot; starring Frank Sinatra and Shirley MacLaine. Some other songs that have become associated with the can-can include Aram Khachaturian&#x27;s &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; from his ballet &quot;Gayane&quot; (1938) and the music hall standard &quot;Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay&quot;. In 1955 Jean Renoir&#x27;s film &quot;French Cancan&quot;, starring Jean Gabin as the director of a music hall which features the can-can, was released.

The can-can has often appeared in ballet, such as Léonide Massine&#x27;s (1919) and (1938), as well as &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;. Another example is the climax of Jean Renoir&#x27;s film &quot;French Cancan&quot;. A well-known can-can occurs at the finale of the &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; from the opera by Amilcare Ponchielli.

French painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec produced several paintings and a large number of posters of can-can dancers. Other painters of the can-can included Georges Seurat, Georges Rouault, and Pablo Picasso.

The can-can has appeared in numerous film and TV productions. The can-can featured prominently in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s Moulin Rouge!. The 2009 anime series &quot;Fairy Tail&quot; featured the music as one of its themes, while a promotional advertisement for &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot; featured one of its lead characters, Coco, performing the dance before destroying the set around her.

In all versions of the Disney Parks&#x27;s boat ride It&#x27;s a Small World, there are some can-can dolls that dancing near the Eiffel Tower to represent the origin country of can-can, France.

<text>John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn, (24 December 1838 – 23 September 1923), was a British Liberal statesman, writer and newspaper editor.

Initially a journalist in the North of England and then editor of the newly Liberal-leaning &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; from 1880 to 1883, he was elected a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Liberal Party in 1883. He was Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1886 and between 1892 and 1895; Secretary of State for India between 1905 and 1910 and again in 1911; and Lord President of the Council between 1910 and 1914.

Morley was a distinguished political commentator, and biographer of his hero, William Ewart Gladstone. Morley is best known for his writings and for his &quot;reputation as the last of the great nineteenth-century Liberals&quot;. He opposed imperialism and the Second Boer War. He supported Home Rule for Ireland. His opposition to British entry into the First World War as an ally of Russia led him to leave the government in August 1914.

==Background and education==
Morley was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, the son of Jonathan Morley, a surgeon, and of Priscilla Mary (née Donkin). He attended Cheltenham College. While at Oxford, he quarrelled with his father over religion, and had to leave the university early without an honours degree; his father had wanted him to become a clergyman. He wrote, in obvious allusion to this rift, &quot;On Compromise&quot; (1874).

==Journalism==
Morley was called to the bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1873, before deciding to pursue a career in journalism. He later described his decision to abandon the law &quot;my long enduring regret&quot;. He edited the newly Radical-Liberal &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; from 1880 to 1883, with W. T. Stead as his assistant editor before going into politics.

==Political career==
Morley first stood for Parliament at the 1869 Blackburn by-election, a rare double by-election held after an election petition led to the results of the 1868 general election in Blackburn being voided. He was unsuccessful in Blackburn, and also failed to win a seat when he contested the City of Westminster at the 1880 general election.

Morley was then elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle upon Tyne at a by-election in February 1883.

===Morley and Newcastle===
Morley was a prominent Gladstonian Liberal. In Newcastle, his constituency association chairman was the effective Robert Spence Watson, a leader of the National Liberal Federation and its chairman from 1890 to 1902. Newcastle, however, was a dual member constituency and Morley&#x27;s parliamentary colleague, Joseph Cowen, was a radical in perpetual conflict with the Liberal Party, who owned the &quot;Newcastle Daily Chronicle.&quot; Cowen attacked Morley from the left, and sponsored working men candidates on his retirement from the seat, showing favour to the local Tory candidate, Charles Hamond. Morley, with Watson&#x27;s machine, withstood the Cowen challenge until the 1895 general election, when the tactics caused the ejection of Morley and the loss of Newcastle to the Tories.

===Chief Secretary for Ireland, 1886, 1892–95===
In February 1886, he was sworn to the Privy Council and made Chief Secretary for Ireland, only to be turned out when Gladstone&#x27;s government fell over Home Rule in July of the same year and Lord Salisbury became prime minister. After the severe defeat of the Gladstonian party at the 1886 general election, Morley divided his life between politics and letters until Gladstone&#x27;s return to power at the 1892 general election, when he resumed as Chief Secretary for Ireland.

He had during the interval taken a leading part in parliament, but his tenure of the chief secretaryship of Ireland was hardly a success. The Irish gentry made things as difficult for him as possible, and the path of an avowed Home Ruler installed in office at Dublin Castle was beset with pitfalls. In the internecine disputes that agitated the Liberal party during Lord Rosebery&#x27;s administration and afterwards, Morley sided with Sir William Harcourt and was the recipient and practically co-signatory of his letter resigning the Liberal leadership in December 1898. He lost his seat in the 1895 general election but soon found another in Scotland, when he was elected at a by-election in February 1896 for the Montrose Burghs.

===Opposition to eight hours working day===
From 1889 onwards, Morley resisted the pressure from labour leaders in Newcastle to support a maximum working day of eight hours enforced by law. Morley objected to this because it would interfere in natural economic processes. It would be &quot;thrusting an Act of Parliament like a ramrod into all the delicate and complex machinery of British industry&quot;. For example, an Eight Hours Bill for miners would impose on an industry with great diversity in local and natural conditions a universal regulation. He further argued that it would be wrong to &quot;enable the Legislature, which is ignorant of these things, which is biased in these things—to give the Legislature the power of saying how many hours a day a man shall or shall not work&quot;.

Morley told trade unionists that the only right way to limit working hours was through voluntary action from them. His outspokenness against any eight hours bill, rare among politicians, brought him the hostility of labour leaders. In September 1891, two mass meetings saw labour leaders such as John Burns, Keir Hardie and Robert Blatchford all calling for action against Morley. In the election of 1892, Morley did not face a labour candidate but the Eight Hours League and the Social Democratic Federation supported the Unionist candidate. Morley kept his seat but came second to the Unionist candidate. When Morley was appointed to the government and the necessary by-election ensued, Hardie and other socialists advised working men to vote for the Unionist candidate (who supported an Eight Hours Bill for miners), but the Irish vote in Newcastle rallied to Morley and he comfortably kept his seat. After a vote on an Eight Hours Bill in the Commons in March 1892, Morley wrote: &quot;That has taken place which I apprehended. The Labour party—that is, the most headstrong and unscrupulous and shallow of those who speak for labour—has captured the Liberal party. Even worse—the Liberal party, on our bench at any rate, has surrendered &quot;sans phrase&quot;, without a word of explanation or vindication&quot;.

===Ideological positions===
In 1880, Morley wrote to Auberon Herbert, an extreme opponent of state intervention, that &quot;I am afraid that I do not agree with you as to paternal government. I am no partisan of a policy of incessant meddling with individual freedom, but I do strongly believe that in so populous a society as ours now is, you may well have a certain protection thrown over classes of men and women who are unable to protect themselves&quot;. In 1885, Morley spoke out against those Liberals who believed that all state intervention was wrong and proclaimed: &quot;I am not prepared to allow that the Liberty and the Property Defence League are the only people with a real grasp of Liberal principles, that Lord Bramwell and the Earl of Wemyss are the only Abdiels of the Liberal Party&quot;. Later that year Morley defined his politics: &quot;I am a cautious Whig by temperament, I am a Liberal by training, and I am a thorough Radical by observation and experience&quot;.

By the mid-1890s, Morley adopted a doctrinaire opposition to state intervention in social and economic matters. He repeatedly expressed his hope that social reform would not become a party issue and warned voters to &quot;Beware of any State action which artificially disturbs the basis of work and wages&quot;. Politicians could not &quot;insure steady work and good wages&quot; because of &quot;great economic tides and currents flowing which were beyond the control of any statesman, Government, or community&quot;. Morley also opposed the state providing benefits for sections or classes of the community as the government should not be used as a tool for sectional or class interests. The Unionist government had proposed to help farmers by assuming some of their rates and wanted to subsidise West Indian sugar producers. Morley viewed these as dangerous precedents of &quot;distributing public money for the purposes of a single class&quot; and he asked voters: &quot;How far are you going to allow this to take you? ... If you are going to give grants to help profits, how are you off from giving grants in favour of aiding wages?&quot; The end of this process, Morley warned, would see &quot;national workshops to which anybody has a right to go and receive money out of your pockets&quot;.

Morley viewed imperialism and an interventionist foreign policy as increasing the power of the state. The increase in state expenditure due to the Boer War (1899–1902) disturbed him because it might lead to the state&#x27;s revenue-raising power being used to implement great changes in the social and economic structure of the country. Francis Hirst recorded in October 1899 about Morley: &quot;He is depressed about national expenditure. He fears, when bad times come, that we shall have not retrenchment, but &#x27;nefarious attacks on property and reversions to Fair Trade&#x27;.&quot; Imperialism and the increasing expenditure needed to fund it would lead to a reconstruction of the income tax and in turn would lead to taxing some people more heavily than others, something which was against the &quot;maxims of public equity&quot;. Morley now regretted Gladstone&#x27;s budget of 1853 (where the income tax was set &quot;on its legs&quot;) because it gave the Chancellor of the Exchequer &quot;a reservoir out of which he could draw with ease and certainty whatever was asked for&quot;. Gladstone had &quot;furnished not only the means, but a &quot;direct incentive&quot; to that policy of expenditure which it was the great object of his life to check&quot;. After Joseph Chamberlain came out in favour of Tariff Reform in 1903, Morley defended Free trade. Morley claimed that it was no coincidence that since the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, Britain was the only great country in Western Europe not to experience &quot;even a shadow of a civil convulsion&quot;. Protectionism was conducive to social distress, political corruption and political unrest.

Morley&#x27;s great speech at Manchester, in 1899, raises him to a special level amongst masters of English rhetoric:You may make thousands of women widows and thousands of children fatherless. It will be wrong. You may add a new province to your empire. It will still be wrong. You may increase the shares of Mr Rhodes and his Chartereds beyond the dreams of avarice. Yea, and it will still be wrong!

Morley was among the original recipients of the Order of Merit in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and received the order from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902. In July 1902, he was presented by Andrew Carnegie with the late Lord Acton&#x27;s valuable library, which, on 20 October, he in turn gave to the University of Cambridge.

===Secretary of State for India===

When Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman formed his cabinet at the end of 1905, Morley was made Secretary of State for India. He would have preferred to have been Chancellor of the Exchequer. In this position, he was conspicuous in May 1907 and afterwards for his firmness in sanctioning extreme measures for dealing with the outbreak in India of alarming symptoms of sedition. Though he was strongly opposed by some of the more extreme members of the Radical party, on the grounds of belying his democratic principles in dealing with the British Raj, his action was generally recognised as combining statesmanship with patience. While firmly opposing revolutionary propaganda, he showed his popular sympathies by appointing two distinguished native Indians to the Council of India and taking steps for a decentralisation of the administrative government. When Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman resigned in 1908 and H. H. Asquith became prime minister, Morley retained his post in the new cabinet; but it was thought advisable to relieve him of the burden imposed by a seat in the House of Commons, and he was transferred to the Upper House, being created a peer with the title of Viscount Morley of Blackburn, in the County palatine of Lancaster. He was the first peer to turn down a coat of arms, although a wall panel at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn incorrectly ascribes one to him.

In September 1906, Morley wrote favourably for staunch resistance to the railway workers&#x27; agitation for higher wages. Failure to do so would damage the Liberal Party with the middle class because &quot;railways are the middle class investment... if anybody thinks we can govern this country against the middle class, he is wrong&quot;. In 1909 the Liberal Chancellor David Lloyd George increased taxes in his budget (the &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot;) to pay for increased armaments and social reform. Morley said that behind the budget &quot;hangs the spectre of Tariff Reform&quot; because the public &quot;&quot;may&quot; say that, if this is the best that can be done under Free Trade, they&#x27;ll try something else&quot;. Morley viewed &quot;the Expenditure of the country&quot; as &quot;the most formidable of our standing problems&quot;.

In 1909, the UK Parliament passed the Indian Councils Act 1909, also known as the Minto–Morley Reforms. Named after Viceroy Lord Minto and Morley, the act introduced elections to legislative councils and admitted Indians to councils of the Secretary of State for India, the viceroy, and to the executive councils of Bombay Presidency and Madras Presidency. Muslims were granted separate electorates according to the demands of the All-India Muslim League. The Act was introduced to introduce communal representation in Indian politics, with the aim of countering the growing nationalism by dividing the common Indian population along communal lines. This ultimately resulted in the partition of the country along religious lines.

Morley continued to hold the seals of the India Office until November 1910, when he resigned them, as he himself revealed subsequently, &quot;partly because I was tired, partly from a feeling that a new viceroy would have fairer openings with a new secretary of state; partly, too, that I might have a farewell chance of literary
self-collection.&quot; One of his last important official acts had been to resist the appointment of Lord Kitchener to the viceroyalty, pressed strongly upon him by King Edward just before his death. Until the outbreak of World War I, Morley remained in the Ministry as Lord President of the Council, and was one of the four counsellors of state to administer the kingdom during George V&#x27;s visit to India for the Delhi Durbar in the winter of 1911–1912.

===Lord President of the Council===
As a member of the House of Lords, Lord Morley of Blackburn helped assure the passage of the Parliament Act 1911, which eliminated the Lords&#x27; power to veto bills.

Owing to the temporary failure of Lord Crewe&#x27;s health, Morley led the House of Lords during most of the session of 1911, in which the reform bill was passed; and it was he who read out to the House on the last night of debate the definite assurance from King George which finally secured the majority of 17: &quot;His Majesty would assent to a creation of peers sufficient in number to guard against any possible combination of the different parties in opposition by which the Parliament bill might be exposed a second time to defeat.&quot;

He not only took charge of the India Office during Lord Crewe&#x27;s illness, and of the Foreign Office in Sir Edward Grey&#x27;s short holidays, but he was an outstanding figure in the Home Rule debates of 1913 and 1914. In moving the second reading of the Amending bill on 1 July 1914, he said that the National Volunteers had dispelled the illusion that the masses of the South and West of Ireland had lost their care for Home Rule.

In the lead-up to Great Britain&#x27;s entry into World War I, on 2 August 1914 the Liberal cabinet declared its intention to defend the French coast against the German Imperial Navy. In opposition to this commitment, Morley resigned along with John Burns. Unlike other Liberals, he was not alarmed by Germany&#x27;s invasion of Belgium. However, he was especially hostile to Russia and felt he could not be a part of a war alongside Russia against Germany.

==Retirement==
In 1917, Lord Morley of Blackburn published his two volumes of memoirs, &quot;Recollections&quot;. In it, he contrasted old and new Liberalism:

The theory of new Liberalism did not seem much more piquant or fertile than the respectable old. As it happened, in the fulness of time our distinguished apostles of Efficiency came into supreme power, with a share in the finest field for efficient diplomacy and an armed struggle, that could have been imagined. Unhappily they broke down, or thought they had (1915), and could discover no better way out of their scrape than to seek deliverance (not without a trace of arbitrary proscription) from the opposing party that counted Liberalism, old or new, for dangerous and deluding moonshine.

During his retirement, Morley kept an interest in politics. He said to his friend John Morgan on 15 February 1918:

I&#x27;m sick of Wilson... He hailed the Russian Revolution six months ago as the new Golden Age, and I said to Page, &#x27;What does he know of Russia?&#x27; to which Page replied, &#x27;Nothing&#x27;. As for his talk about a union of hearts after the war, &quot;the world is not made like that&quot;.

This led Morgan to ask Morley about the League of Nations: &quot;A mirage, and an old one&quot;. Morgan asked: &quot;How are you going to enforce it?&quot;, whereupon Morley replied: &quot;How indeed? One may as well talk of London morality being due to the Archbishop of Canterbury. But take away Scotland Yard!&quot; When asked in 1919 about the Covenant of the League of Nations, Morley said: &quot;I have not read it, and I don&#x27;t intend to read it. It&#x27;s not worth the paper it&#x27;s written on. To the end of time it&#x27;ll always be a case of &#x27;Thy head or my head&#x27;. I&#x27;ve no faith in these schemes&quot;. When a prominent Liberal praised someone as &quot;a good European&quot; Morley remarked: &quot;When I lay me down at night or rise in the morning I do not ask myself if I am a good European&quot;. Towards the close of 1919 he was worried about Britain&#x27;s guarantee to France:

Surely a permanent commitment like that is contrary to all our foreign policy. What do the words &#x27;unprovoked attack&#x27; by Germany mean? They are dangerously vague. I&#x27;ve been discussing them with Rosebery and he is as uneasy as I am. He wrote a letter to the Press about it, and &quot;The Times&quot; refused to publish it.

He often criticised Labour Party policies and said to Morgan: &quot;Have you read Henderson&#x27;s speech about a capital levy? It&#x27;s rank piracy&quot;. During a discussion on 6 May 1919, Morley remarked: &quot;I see Lloyd George has invited the Irish &quot;republicans&quot; to a conference. It&#x27;s an act of inconceivable folly—he, the King&#x27;s Prime Minister!&quot; When the House of Lords were debating the Fourth Home Rule Bill, Morley said to Morgan on 6 January 1921:

I should have liked to have been there if only to have got up and said, &#x27;If Mr. G&#x27;s Home Rule Bill had been passed 30 years ago could Ireland have been worse than now? Would it have not been better?&#x27; And then fallen dead like Lord Chatham.

On 1 May 1921, Morley said: &quot;If I were an Irishman I should be a Sinn Féiner&quot;. When asked by Morgan: &quot;And a Republican?&quot; Morley said &quot;No&quot;.

He liked Winston Churchill and said to Morgan on 22 December 1921:

I foresee the day when Birkenhead will be Prime Minister in the Lords with Winston leading the Commons. They will make a formidable pair. Winston tells me Birkenhead has the best brain in England... But I don&#x27;t like Winston&#x27;s habit of writing articles, as a Minister, on debatable questions of foreign policy in the newspapers. These allocutions of his are contrary to all Cabinet principles. Mr. G. would never have allowed it.

In a letter to Sir Francis Webster in 1923, Morley wrote:

Present party designations have become empty of all contents... Vastly extended State expenditure, vastly increased demands from the taxpayer who has to provide the money, social reform regardless of expense, cash exacted from the taxpayer already at his wits&#x27; end—when were the problems of &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot; more desperate? How are we to measure the use and abuse of industrial organization? Powerful orators find &quot;Liberty&quot; the true keyword, but then I remember hearing from a learned student that of &quot;liberty&quot; he knew well over two hundred definitions. Can we be sure that the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have-nots&quot; will agree in their selection of the right one? We can only trust to the growth of responsibility; we may look to circumstances and events to teach their lesson.

==Literature==
Morley devoted a considerable amount of time to literature, his anti-Imperial views being practically swamped by the overwhelming predominance of Unionism and Imperialism. His position as a leading British writer had early been determined by his monographs on Voltaire (1872), Rousseau (1873), Diderot and the Encyclopaedists (1878), Burke (1879), and Walpole (1889). Burke as the champion of sound policy in America and of justice in India, Walpole as the pacific minister understanding the true interests of his country, fired his imagination. &quot;Burke&quot; was Morley&#x27;s contribution to Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;English Men of Letters&quot; series of literary biographies, of which Morley himself was general editor between 1878 and 1892; he edited a second series of these volumes from 1902 to 1919. The &quot;Life of Cobden&quot; (1881) is an able defence of that statesman&#x27;s views rather than a critical biography or a real picture of the period.

The &quot;Life of Oliver Cromwell&quot; (1900) revised Samuel Rawson Gardiner as Gardiner had revised Thomas Carlyle. Morley&#x27;s contributions to political journalism and to literary, ethical and philosophical criticism were numerous and valuable. They show great individuality of character, and recall the personality of John Stuart Mill, with whose mode of thought he had many affinities. After the death of Gladstone, Morley was principally engaged in his biography, until it was published in 1903. Representing as it does so competent a writer&#x27;s sifting of a mass of material, the &quot;Life of Gladstone&quot; was a masterly account of the career of the great Liberal statesman; traces of Liberal bias were inevitable but are rarely manifest; and in spite of the &quot;a priori&quot; unlikelihood of a full appreciation of Gladstone&#x27;s powerful religious interests from such a quarter (Morley was an agnostic), the whole treatment is characterized by sympathy and judgement. The work was very successful, selling more than 25,000 copies in its first year.

Morley was a Trustee of the British Museum from 1894 to 1921, Honorary Professor of Ancient Literature at the Royal Academy of Arts, and member of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. He was Chancellor of the Victoria University of Manchester from 1908 until 1923, when he resigned. He was nominated for a Nobel Prize in Literature eleven times. He received an honorary degree (LL.D.) from the University of St Andrews in October 1902.

==Legacy==
A philosophical Radical of a somewhat mid-19th century type, and highly suspicious of the later opportunistic reaction (in all its forms) against Cobdenite principles, he yet retained the respect of the majority whom it was his usual fate to find against him in British politics by the indomitable consistency of his principles and by sheer force of character and honesty of conviction and utterance. His legacy was a purely moral one; although in May 1870 he married Mrs. Rose Mary Ayling, the union produced no heirs. Mrs. Ayling was already married when she met John Morley and the couple waited to marry until her first husband died several years later (another similarity to John Stuart Mill). She was never received into polite society, and many of his colleagues, including Asquith, never met her. Morley had three siblings, Edward Sword Morley (1828–1901), William Wheelhouse Morley (1840 – c. 1870), and Grace Hannah Morley (1842–1925).

According to historian Stanley Wolpert in his 1967 book: &quot;It is hardly exaggeration to speculate that, but for the socially unpardonable circumstances surrounding his marriage, Morley might well have become Britain&#x27;s foreign secretary, possibly even prime minister&quot;. After more than 50 years of a quietly secluded personal life, Viscount Morley of Blackburn died of heart failure at his home, Flowermead, Wimbledon Park, south London, on 23 September 1923, aged eighty-four, when the viscountcy became extinct. After cremation at Golders Green Crematorium, his ashes were buried at Putney Vale Cemetery. He was followed in death several months later by Rose. Morley&#x27;s estate was valued for probate at £59,765, a surprising sum for a self-made man who devoted his life to writing and politics.

Morley inspired many leading figures of the 20th century, including Mahomed Ali Jinnah, the founding father of Pakistan. The Austrian-born classical liberal theorist Friedrich Hayek, writing in 1944, as a British citizen, wrote about Morley&#x27;s reputation:

It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that the more typically English a writer on political or social problems then appeared to the world, the more he is to-day forgotten in his own country. Men like Lord Morley or Henry Sidgwick, Lord Acton or A. V. Dicey, who were then admired in the world at large as outstanding examples of the political wisdom of liberal England, are to the present generation largely obsolete Victorians.

<doc id="428622" wikidata="Q7816576" url="?curid=428622" title="Tom Levitt">
<text>Tom Levitt (born 10 April 1954) is a former British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for High Peak from the 1997 to 2010 general elections.

==Early life==
Born in Crewe in 1954, Levitt was raised in Leek, Staffordshire. He was one of the first male intakes when a girls&#x27; grammar school, Westwood High, became a comprehensive. He is a biology graduate of Lancaster University and has a teaching qualification from Oxford University.

==Early career==
Levitt taught in comprehensive schools and in further education. He is the author of a textbook on intertidal ecology.

As a consultant on disabled access to services and information (1993–97), Levitt wrote three books: &quot;Sound Policies&quot;, &quot;Sound Practice&quot; and &quot;Clear Access&quot;. These deal with the way local authorities provide services for people with hearing and visual impairments. Levitt also worked as a successful Deaf Awareness trainer.

==Political career==
After unsuccessfully contesting Stroud in the 1987 general election and High Peak in 1992, Levitt was first elected to the House of Commons for the latter seat at the 1997 general election. He had 14 years service at all levels of local government, including Derbyshire County Council, where he was for a year a vice chair of Education. He was also a member of the management committee of High Peak Citizens Advice Bureau. As one of the few MPs with a qualification in British Sign Language, Levitt was an elected Trustee of the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) from 1998 to 2003. Levitt was the first MP to use BSL in the House of Commons. He chaired the Community Development Foundation from 2004 to 2010.

From 1997 to 2003, Levitt was on the Standards &amp; Privileges Committee, responsible for monitoring standards of MPs&#x27; professional conduct. In 2004 he sat on the Scrutiny Committee for the Draft Disability Bill.

Following his election he held several junior positions. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Barbara Roche MP (1999–2003), first in the Home Office and then in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Following this he was the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Hilary Benn, the Secretary of State for International Development, from 2003 to 2007. He was a member of the Work and Pensions Committee from 2007 and assistant to the Regional Minister for the East Midlands.

Levitt is known to be in favour of the Longdendale Bypass, which would run through the north of his former constituency. In November 2009, Levitt told the Labour Party that he would not be a candidate at the 2010 general election.

Levitt resigned his membership of the Labour Party in April 2019, describing the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn as &quot;incompetent, hypocritical and profoundly wrong on key issues&quot;. He subsequently declared his support for and involvement in Change UK - The Independent Group.

===Expenses===
During the furore over MPs&#x27; expenses in 2009, it was revealed Levitt had submitted a £16.50 claim in 2006 for a memorial wreath. He said the claim had been submitted by accident by a member of staff and that the claim had been rejected.

Levitt spent £8,013 on a new bathroom in his London flat; however, only £6,335 of this was paid because he had exceeded the maximum spend. This was in addition to an initial claim of £5,281 for renovation work on his London flat. Levitt has said that he believed he had been &#x27;moderate&#x27; in his claims for accommodation in London.

In 2007, it had been revealed that Levitt had, of all MPs, claimed the eighth highest total expenses—£168,660 in 2006–2007, an increase of £29,103 on the previous year. Despite the adverse reaction in the local press, in following years Levitt&#x27;s expenses remained at the same level, with £164,620 claimed in 2007–2008, and £168,318 claimed in 2008–2009.

==Business interests==
In 2010 Levitt set up Sector4Focus, a consultancy which promotes relationships between the private, public and charitable sectors.

He has also written two books on similar subjects, &quot;Welcome to Good Co&quot; and in 2018, the &quot;Company Citizen&quot; about which former Unilever CEO Paul Polman said ‘Never has the case for business to step up and help solve society’s challenges been greater. And rarely has it been better put than in this excellent account’.

In 2015 he helped found the anti-poverty social enterprise, Fair for You, and has held various other charity trusteeships and non-executive roles in social enterprises.

==Personal life==
Levitt lived in Buxton from 1991 to 2011 and now lives in west London. He is the author of two plays, &quot;Making Allowances&quot; (2010) and &quot;PowerPlay&quot; (2018).

<doc id="428625" wikidata="Q620167" url="?curid=428625" title="Frontend and backend">
<text>In software development, frontend refers to the presentation layer that users interact with, while backend involves the data management and processing behind the scenes. In the client–server model, the client is usually considered the frontend, handling user-facing tasks, and the server is the backend, managing data and logic. Some presentation tasks may also be performed by the server.

== Introduction ==
In software architecture, there may be many layers between the hardware and end user. The &quot;front&quot; is an abstraction, simplifying the underlying component by providing a user-friendly interface, while the &quot;back&quot; usually handles data storage and business logic.

== Examples ==

E-commerce Website: The &quot;frontend&quot; is the user interface (e.g., product pages, search bar), while the &quot;backend&quot; processes payments and updates inventory.

Banking App: The &quot;frontend&quot; displays account balances, while the &quot;backend&quot; handles secure transactions and updates records.

Social Media Platform: The &quot;frontend&quot; shows the news feed, while the &quot;backend&quot; stores posts and manages notifications.

In telecommunication, the &quot;front&quot; can be considered a device or service, while the &quot;back&quot; is the infrastructure that supports provision of service.

A rule of thumb is that the client-side (or &quot;frontend&quot;) is any component manipulated by the user. The server-side (or &quot;backend&quot;) code usually resides on the server, often far removed physically from the user.

== Software definitions ==

In content management systems, the terms &quot;frontend&quot; and &quot;backend&quot; may refer to the end-user facing views of the CMS and the administrative views, respectively.

In speech synthesis, the frontend refers to the part of the synthesis system that converts the input text into a symbolic phonetic representation, and the backend converts the symbolic phonetic representation into actual sounds.

In compilers, the &quot;frontend&quot; translates a computer programming source code into an intermediate representation, and the backend works with the intermediate representation to produce code in a computer output language. The backend usually optimizes to produce code that runs faster. The frontend/backend distinction can separate the parser section that deals with source code and the backend that generates code and optimizes. Some designs, such as GCC, offer choices between multiple frontends (parsing different source languages) or backends (generating code for different target processors).

Some graphical user interface (GUI) applications running in a desktop environment are implemented as a thin frontend for underlying command-line interface (CLI) programs, to save the user from learning the special terminology and memorizing the commands.

=== Web development as an example ===
Another way to understand the difference between the two is to understand the knowledge required of a frontend vs. a backend software developer. The list below focuses on web development as an example.

==== Both ====
* Version control tools such as Git, Mercurial, or Subversion
* File transfer tools and protocols such as FTP or rsync

==== Frontend focused ====
* Markup and web languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ancillary libraries commonly used in those languages such as Sass or jQuery
* Asynchronous request handling and AJAX
* Single-page applications (with frameworks like React, Angular or Vue.js)
* Web performance (largest contentful paint, time to interactive, 60 FPS animations and interactions, memory usage, etc.)
* Responsive web design
* Cross-browser compatibility issues and workarounds
* End-to-end testing with a headless browser
* Build automation to transform and bundle JavaScript files, reduce image sizes and other processes using tools such as Webpack and Gulp.js 
* Search engine optimization
* Accessibility concerns
* Basic usage of image editing tools such as GIMP or Photoshop
* User interface

==== Backend focused ====
* Scripting languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, Node.js, or Compiled languages like C#, Java or Go
* Data access layer
* Business logic
* Database administration
* Scalability
* High availability
* Security concerns, authentication and authorization
* Software architecture
* Data transformation
* Backup methods and software
Note that both positions, despite possibly working on one product, have a very distinct set of skills.

=== API ===

The frontend communicates with backend through an API. In the case of web and mobile frontends, the API is often based on HTTP request/response. The API is sometimes designed using the &quot;Backend for Frontend&quot; (BFF) pattern, that serves responses to ease the processing on frontend side.

== Hardware definitions ==
In network computing, &quot;frontend&quot; can refer to any hardware that optimizes or protects network traffic. It is called application front-end hardware because it is placed on the network&#x27;s outward-facing frontend or boundary. Network traffic passes through the front-end hardware before entering the network.

In processor design, &quot;frontend design&quot; would be the initial description of the behavior of a circuit in a hardware description language such as Verilog, while &quot;backend design&quot; would be the process of mapping that behavior to physical transistors on a die.

<text>Graham bread is a name for whole wheat bread that was inspired by the teachings of health reformer Sylvester Graham. The ingredients for Graham bread include Graham flour, milk, molasses, yeast, and salt.

== History ==
Sylvester Graham was a 19th-century health reformer who argued that a vegetarian diet, anchored by bread that was baked at home from a coarsely ground whole-wheat flour, was part of a healthful lifestyle that could prevent disease.

In 1837, Graham published the popular book &quot;Treatise on Bread and Bread-Making&quot;, which included a history of bread and described how to make Graham bread, though the passage is absent of any exact measurements and instead calls upon the baker&#x27;s &quot;good judgment.&quot; It was reprinted in 2012 by Andrews McMeel Publishing, as a selection of its American Antiquarian Cookbook Collection. 

Like Graham crackers, Graham bread was high in fiber and made from graham flour free from the chemical additives that were common in white bread at that time such as alum and chlorine. He argued that these chemical additives were unwholesome.

<doc id="428627" wikidata="Q749659" url="?curid=428627" title="Ivan Lewis">
<text>Ivan Lewis (born 4 March 1967) is a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bury South from 1997 to 2019, initially as a member of the Labour Party then as an independent from 2017. 

After serving in various ministerial positions, including Foreign Affairs, International Development, Education and Health under Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown from 2001 to 2010, Lewis was Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport until October 2011, when he was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for International Development. In the October 2013 Shadow Cabinet reshuffle, he became Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Following Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s election as Labour leader in September 2015, Lewis was dismissed from the shadow cabinet.

Lewis was suspended from the Labour Party in November 2017 after sexual misconduct allegations. He resigned from the Labour Party in December 2018, citing his concerns about antisemitism in the party and the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. Lewis sat as an independent MP until the 2019 General Election, when he stood as an independent candidate in Bury South. During the campaign Lewis urged voters to support the Conservatives rather than himself when it became clear his candidature could allow Labour to win and inadvertently boost Corbyn&#x27;s chances of becoming prime minister.

== Early life and career ==
Lewis was born in Prestwich, in the Bury South constituency which he later represented, into a British Jewish family. He was educated at Manchester Jewish Day School in Prestwich (primary school) and at William Hulme Grammar School in Manchester, followed by Stand Sixth Form College and Bury College.
Before his election in 1997, he worked in the voluntary sector from 1986 to 1997 for the learning disabilities support group Contact Community Care Group and as Chief Executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation.

Lewis also served as a Councillor on Bury Metropolitan Borough Council for the Sedgley ward, being elected in 1990 at 23 years of age and held the position of Chairman of the Social Services Committee.

== Political career ==

=== In government ===
Lewis was first elected to Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide with a 13% swing and a majority of over 12,000 votes over the incumbent Conservative David Sumberg who had served since 1983. He further increased his majority in the 2001 General Election. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Stephen Byers from July 1999 to June 2001.

Between June 2001 and June 2002, Lewis was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Young People and Learning within the Department for Education and Skills and then for Adult Learning and Skills. From June 2002 to May 2005, he became Under-Secretary of State for Skills and Vocational Education in the same department.

As a junior minister Lewis was responsible for the White Paper &quot;21st Century Skills: Realising our Potential&quot;, launched in 2003. It proposed increased support for adults seeking to gain technical and craft qualifications where regional skills shortages existed, removing the age limit for Modern Apprentices and making information and communications technology the third essential &quot;skill for life&quot; alongside literacy and numeracy.

Lewis was also involved with a scheme to introduce apprenticeships for 14-year-olds alongside their schooling, commenting that Britain needed to challenge &quot;uniquely snobbish&quot; attitudes toward vocational education

Lewis then served as Economic Secretary to the Treasury from May 2005 to May 2006. He was moved to a junior ministerial position in the Department of Health in the Cabinet reshuffle in May 2006.

On 29 June 2007, in Gordon Brown&#x27;s first reshuffle as Prime Minister he was re-appointed to the post of Parliamentary under-secretary of state in the Department of Health, the only junior minister to survive the reshuffle where he held on to the brief for social care and added mental health services.

=== Minister for Care Services 2006 to 2008 ===
As Minister for Care Services, Lewis led the introduction of Putting People First, the then government&#x27;s policy (accepted by the incoming coalition government) to personalise the provision of social care services for the elderly and people with disabilities. The policy offered adults eligible for care services the ability choose their own care services from a &quot;personal budget&quot;, and shifted some responsibilities from the NHS to councils.

Lewis described his own policy changes as &quot;arguably the biggest redistribution of power from the state to the citizen that we have ever seen&quot;, while David Brindle of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised him for having done a &quot;huge amount&quot; to raise the profile of social care.

In March 2008, Lewis warned that the Labour Party was losing touch with ordinary people under the leadership of Gordon Brown in an article written for Progress Online. Lewis stated he believed the Government had lost touch with what fairness meant to the mainstream majority. He wrote:

=== Text messages incident ===
In 2008, the Department of Health confirmed Lewis had made an apology for his behaviour when in 2007 he began sending increasingly intimate text messages to then aide Susie Mason, which ultimately led to her registering concern, and successfully seeking an alternative position within the Civil Service before leaving for the private sector. Nick Cohen pointed out in &quot;The Observer&quot; on 14 September 2008 that the revelations about Lewis&#x27;s private life followed articles by Lewis which constituted coded attacks on Gordon Brown.

In his book &quot;The End of the Party: The Rise and Fall of New Labour&quot;, the journalist Andrew Rawnsley suggested that Lewis was a target of &quot;Gordon Brown&#x27;s Hit Squad&quot;. In relation to the Susie Mason story, Rawnsley wrote: &quot;Yet there were few Labour MPs who doubted that the story was planted by No. 10, which was privy to a confidential Whitehall report about the civil servant. The hit on Lewis stunned Ministers who regarded themselves as unshockable&quot;. The story was leaked twelve months after the events occurred. Senior civil servants dealing with the Mason issue advised that no action should be taken against Lewis.

Brown&#x27;s former communications chief, Damian McBride, confessed in his memoir that he reprimanded Lewis, then junior health minister, in 2008 for commenting on tax policy, only to be passed the message that Lewis would not be intimidated. Angered, McBride then fed to the &quot;News of the World&quot; a story about Lewis allegedly pestering a young female civil servant in his private office. McBride expressed deep remorse in retrospect, saying he had been &quot;a cruel, vindictive, thoughtless bastard&quot;.

=== Department for International Development; Foreign and Commonwealth Office ===
On 3 October 2008, Lewis moved to the Department for International Development (DfID). There, he spearheaded a campaign to persuade other Governments and multilateral agencies to prioritise maternal health.

He remained there until June 2009, when he was promoted to Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. Lewis was responsible for the UK&#x27;s Middle East policy, the UK&#x27;s relations with the US and China, counter terrorism and counter proliferation.

=== Vioxx ===
In 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported, following his promise to assist British users of the drug &quot;Vioxx&quot; (produced by Merck) with legal fees in their attempt to claim damages, Lewis changed his mind within hours of an &quot;expensive lobbying effort&quot; by Merck. Vioxx has been shown to increase the risk of heart failure in users. It transpired subsequently that because of his promise to assist, the Department of Health replaced Lewis on all Vioxx related issues with another Minister.

=== In Opposition ===
In October 2010, Lewis was elected by his fellow Labour MPs to the Shadow Cabinet and appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport by Labour Leader Ed Miliband.

In September 2011, Lewis was reappointed to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for International Development. Lewis is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

In October 2013, Lewis was moved in a Shadow Cabinet reshuffle from the International Development portfolio to the Shadow Northern Ireland one. However, despite his reshuffle, which was seen by many commentators as a demotion, he fulfilled a standing commitment to outline Labour&#x27;s vision on International Development at The University of Manchester, during Manchester Policy Week. In the September 2015 Labour shadow cabinet reshuffle under the newly elected leader Jeremy Corbyn, Lewis offered to continue in the role of Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland temporarily amid the troubling political situation there. Lewis reported that Corbyn had rejected his offer and informed him by text message that he had decided to give the role to another MP.

=== One Nation Labour ===
Lewis was one of the key figures influencing the Labour Party&#x27;s political thinking and direction during Ed Miliband&#x27;s leadership. He was one of the co-originators of the notion of One Nation Labour, which formed the foundation of Miliband&#x27;s keynote speech at the Labour Party Conference held in Manchester in September 2012.

Lewis had originally floated the concept in a chapter written for &quot;The Purple Book&quot;, a collection of essays written by mainly senior figures in the party offering new policy ideas.

=== Mayoral candidacy ===
In February 2016, Lewis announced his intention to seek the Labour candidacy nomination for the post of the directly elected Mayor of Greater Manchester. On 9 August that year, the Labour Party announced that Andy Burnham would be the mayoral candidate.

=== Sexual harassment allegations, suspension and resignation ===
On 23 November 2017, the Labour Party suspended Lewis from the party subject to investigation following allegations of sexual harassment. On 20 December 2018, Lewis resigned from the Labour Party in protest at alleged anti-Semitism in the party and Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership. Lewis initially intended to stand as an independent for re-election at the 2019 general election, but later withdrew his candidacy (although his name still appeared on ballot papers, as he withdrew too late to formally exit the contest). Instead, Lewis urged his supporters to vote for the Conservative candidate Christian Wakeford. Lewis ultimately polled 1,366 votes as an independent candidate.

== Personal life ==
Lewis married Juliette Fox in Stockport in June 1990. They have two sons, and are now divorced.

<text>2C-B (4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine), also known as Nexus, is a synthetic psychedelic drug of the 2C family, mainly used as a recreational drug. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974 for use in psychotherapy. To date, there is limited scientific information regarding the drug&#x27;s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects in humans. The existing studies primarily classify 2C-B as a stimulant and hallucinogen, and less commonly an entactogen and empathogen.

2C-B is also known by a number of slang names and appears on the illicit market in multiple forms: as a powder, in capsules or pills. For recreational use, the substance is generally consumed orally or nasally. In Shulgin&#x27;s book &quot;PiHKAL&quot;, the oral dosage range is listed as 12–24 mg.

== History ==
2C-B was synthesized from 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde by American chemist Alexander Shulgin in 1974. It first saw use among the psychiatric community as an aid during therapy, but was abandoned due to gastrointestinal effects and the lack of empathogenic effects. 2C-B was first sold commercially as a purported aphrodisiac under the trade name &quot;Erox&quot;, which was manufactured by the German pharmaceutical company Drittewelle. For several years, it was available as tablets in Dutch smart shops under the name &quot;Nexus&quot; and &quot;B-Dub&quot;.

==Patterns of use==

=== Recreational ===

2C-B became briefly popular in the United States as substitute for the street drug ecstasy (MDMA) when the latter became illegal in 1985. Many 2C-B users are young adults who attend raves. Although 2C-B is still used in the rave subculture (commonly mistaken for and/or sold as ecstasy), more knowledgable use has become more widespread in the 2000s.

In 2011, street prices in the United States ranged between $10 and $30 per tablet when purchased in small quantities. Larger retail purchases cost between $200 and $500 per gram. Wholesale purchases of 2C-B would lower the price ($100 to $300 per gram in 2001, $30 to $100 on the darknet in 2020).

=== Entheogenic use ===
There are claims that 2C-B was used as entheogen by the Sangoma, Nyanga, and Amagqirha people in place of their traditional plants; they refer to the chemical as &quot;Ubulawu Nomathotholo&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;Medicine of the Singing Ancestors&quot;.

==Effects==
Little academic research has been conducted on the effects of 2C-B in humans. The information available is largely anecdotal and limited. Effects are often described as being more easily managed than other psychedelics; it is often compared to a mixture of a serotonergic psychedelic and MDMA. At 5–10 mg, experiments with young chickens have shown it to produce effects similar to a low dosage of amphetamines.

The anecdotal effects of 2C-B that have been reported by users on online discussion forums include:

* At low doses, the experience may shift in intensity from engaging to mild/undetectable. Experienced users report the ability to take control of the effects and switch from engaged to sober at will.
* The hallucinations have a tendency to decrease and then increase in intensity, giving the users a sense of &quot;waves&quot; or even glowing. These are popularly described as &quot;clichéd &#x27;70s visuals&quot; or objects taking on &quot;water color&quot;-like textures.
* While the effects of the drug often render users unable to concentrate deeply on anything in particular, some can become engrossed in an activity such as watching a movie or playing a video game, thus distracting themselves from the visual and auditory effects of the drug.
* Excessive giggling or smiling is common, as is a tendency for deeper &quot;belly laughs&quot;.
* Some users say that the effects are more intense when listening to music and report that they can see sounds and noises.
* Some users experience a decrease in visual acuity, although others report sharper vision.
* Through increased awareness of one&#x27;s body, attention may be brought to perceived &quot;imperfections&quot; or internal body processes.&quot;The following effects are highly dose-dependent.&quot;
* Open eye visuals (OEVs), such as cartoon-like distortions and red or green halos around objects. Closed eye visuals (CEVs) are more common than OEVs.
* Affects and alters ability to communicate, engage in deep thought, or maintain attention span.
* Some users report experiencing frightening or fearful effects during the experience. Users describe feeling frigid or cold on reaching a plateau, while others feel wrapped in comfortable blankets/ultimate pleasure.
* Coordination may be affected; some users lose balance or have perceptual distinction problems.
* Onset time of 2C-B is highly dose dependent, but usually from 45 to 75 minutes. Taken on a full stomach, the onset time is increased to two hours or more.
* Before it was scheduled, 2C-B was sold in small doses as an aphrodisiac (see History). Some users report aphrodisiac effects at lower doses.

Clinical studies in humans suggest that 2C-B is a psychedelic with some possible entactogen-like effects. Specific effects have included slight hallucinogenic states, perceptual changes, ego dissolution, time dilation, euphoria, feelings of well-being, reduced anger, increased reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, decreased ability to recognize expressions of happiness, augmented emotionality in speech, and mild sympathomimetic effects such as pressor effects, among others.

===Side effects===
* Some users report mild &quot;jitters&quot; (body tremors), shuddering breath, and/or mild muscle spasms after insufflating 2C-B. Whether or not these effects are enjoyable depends on the user;
* Mild to intense diarrhea, gas, nausea, and general gastrointestinal discomfort;
* Severe headaches after coming down from large doses have been reported. However, many users report a lack of &quot;comedown&quot; or &quot;crash&quot;, instead noting a gradual return to sobriety;
* At doses over 30–40 mg the user may experience frightening hallucinations, as well as tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia;
* 2C-B HCl is very painful to insufflate. Anecdotal evidence suggests that 2C-B HBr, the hydrobromide salt with greater water solubility, is less irritating to the mucous membranes lining the nose but slightly less potent when compared dose-for-dose with the HCl salt;
* Rectal administration of a water-based solution of 2C-B is known to be less painful than insufflation and much more potent than oral administration.

===Duration===
When orally consumed, 2C-B has a much longer delay before the onset of effects than when it is insufflated. Oral ingestion generally takes roughly 45–75 minutes for the effects to be felt, plateau lasts 2–4 hours, and coming down lasts 1–2 hours. Rectal administration onset varies from 5 to 20 minutes. Insufflated onset takes 1–10 minutes for effects to be felt. The duration can last from 4 to 12 hours depending on route of administration, dose, and other factors.

With insufflation, the effects are more abrupt and intense but have a significantly shorter duration, while oral usage results in a milder, longer experience. When insufflated, the onset happens very rapidly, usually reaching the peak at about 20–40 minutes and plateauing for 2–3 hours. 2C-B is also considered one of the most painful drugs to insufflate, with users reporting intense nasal burning. The sudden intensity of the experience combined with the pain can often start the experience with a negative imprint and nausea is also increased with insufflation, compounding the issue.

==Toxicity and dosage==
The September 1998 issue of &quot;Journal of Analytical Toxicology&quot; reported that very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-B. The relationship between its use and death is unknown. The common oral recreational dose is around 15–25 mg,&lt;ref name=&quot;urlErowid 2C-B Vault : Dose/Dosage&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at which visual and auditory effects are experienced. Severe adverse reactions are extremely rare, but use of 2C-B was linked to significant brain injury in one case report; the alleged &quot;2C-B&quot; was never actually discovered by testing so the only evidence suggesting 2C-B was the cause was the victim&#x27;s own words, without taking into consideration that adulteration and impurities are very common in illicit drugs.

The lethal dosage is unknown. It was reported in &quot;PiHKAL&quot;, by Alexander Shulgin, that a psychologist had accidentally taken a 100 mg dose orally without apparent harm.

When sold as &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, tablets containing 2C-B often contain about 5 mg of the drug, an amount which produces stimulatory effects that mimic the effects of MDMA; in contrast, tablets marketed as 2C-B have larger quantities of the drug (10–20 mg) which cause hallucinogenic effects. Street purity of 2C-B, when tested, has been found to be relatively high. Researchers in Spain found that 2C-B samples in the country doubled between 2006 and 2009, switched from primarily powder form to tablets, and exhibited &quot;low falsification rates&quot;. An analysis of street samples in the Netherlands found impurities &quot;in small percentages&quot;; only one of the impurities, the N-acetyl derivative of 2C-B, could be identified, and comprised 1.3% of the sample. The authors suggested that this compound was a by-product of 2C-B synthesis.

==Pharmacology==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Unlike most psychedelics, 2C-B has been shown to be a low efficacy human serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonist. This suggests that activation of the 5-HT2A-coupled phospholipase D pathway or functional antagonism of 5-HT2A may also play a role. The rank order of 5-HT2A receptor antagonist potency for this family of drugs in &quot;Xenopus&quot; is 2C-I &gt; 2C-B &gt; 2C-D &gt; 2C-H.

Although 2C-B itself was not evaluated, other closely related members of the 2C series, including 2C-C, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-I, and 2C-T-2, all showed no activity as monoamine releasing agents of serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine ( = &gt;100,000nM or &quot;inactive&quot;). Likewise, these other 2C derivatives showed little activity as serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists ( = &gt;3,000nM).

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

==== Metabolism ====
2C-B has been shown to be metabolized by liver hepatocytes, resulting in deamination and demethylation that produces several products. Oxidative deamination results in the 2-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-ethanol (BDMPE) and 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid (BDMPAA) metabolites. Additionally, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid (BDMBA) can also be produced by oxidative deamination. Further metabolism of BDMPE and BDMPAA may occur by demethylation. Alternatively, the later metabolites can be generated by demethylation of 2C-B followed by oxidative deamination.

There is species differentiation in the metabolism of 2C-B. Mice hepatocytes produce 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-phenol (BDMP), a previously unknown metabolite. Meanwhile, human, monkey and rabbit hepatocytes produce 2-(4-bromo-2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-ethanol (B-2-HMPE), but dog, rat and mouse hepatocytes do not.

== Chemistry ==

===Analogues and derivatives===
A variety of N-substituted derivatives of 2C-B have been tested, including N-methyl-2CB, N,N-dimethyl-2CB, N-ethyl-2CB and N-benzyl-2CB. Most simple alkyl derivatives were considerably less potent than 2C-B, with N-ethyl-2CB for instance having a 40 times lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. The N-benzyl derivative however was found to have higher binding affinity than 2C-B itself, with N-(4-bromobenzyl)-2CB binding even more tightly. This initial research did not include functional assays of activity, but later led to the development of potent substituted N-benzyl derivatives such as 25B-NBOMe, and 25B-NBOH. βk-2C-B shows dramatically reduced potency and efficacy as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist compared to 2C-B.

=== Reagent results ===
Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test.

== Legal status ==
===United Nations===
The UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs added 2C-B to Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances in March 2001.

2C-B is a scheduled drug in most jurisdictions. The following is a partial list of territories where the substance has been scheduled.

===Countries===

====Argentina====
2C-B is controlled under the List 1, as well as similar substances like 2C-I or 2C-T-2.

====Australia====
2C-B is controlled in Australia and on the list of substances subject to import and export controls (Appendix B). It was placed on Schedule One of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act when it first came to notice in 1994, when in a showcase legal battle chemist R. Simpson was charged with manufacturing the substance in Sydney. Alexander Shulgin came to Australia to testify on behalf of the defense, to no avail.

2C-B is not specifically listed in the Australia Poisons Standard (October 2015), however similar drugs such as 2C-T-2 and 2C-I are making 2C-B fall under the Australian analogue act.

====Belgium====
In Belgium, 2C-B is a controlled substance making production, distribution, and possession illegal.

====Brazil====
In Brazil, 2C-B is a controlled substance making production, distribution, and possession illegal.

====Canada====
In Canada, 2C-B is classified under Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as Schedule III as &quot;4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzeneethanamine and any salt, isomer or salt of isomer thereof&quot;.

2C-B has been rescheduled (Schedule III), in a new amendment, taking effect on October 31, 2016. This is to include the other 2C-x analogues.

====Chile====
In August 2007, 2C-B, along with many other psychologically active substances, was added to Ley 20.000, known as the .

====Czech Republic====
Possession of more than 200 mg of 2C-B is punishable with a two years jail sentence. Smaller amount is punishable by a fine. The 200 mg threshold is merely a guideline which the court can reconsider depending on circumstances.

====Denmark====
In Denmark, 2C-B is listed as a category B drug.

====Estonia====
In Estonia, 2C-B is classified as Schedule I.

====Germany====
In Germany, 2C-B is controlled in the Betäubungsmittelgesetz (BtMG) Anlage I as &quot;Bromdimethoxyphenethylamin&quot; (BDMPEA).

====Italy====
2C-B is schedule I (tabella I).

====Japan====
In Japan, 2C-B was scheduled in 1998. It was previously marketed as &quot;Performax&quot;.

==== Luxembourg ====
In Luxembourg, 2C-B is a prohibited substance since 2001.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, 2C-B was scheduled on July 9, 1997.

In the Netherlands, 2C-B became a list I substance of the Opium Law despite no health incidents occurring. Following the ban, other phenethylamines were sold in place of 2C-B until the Netherlands became the first country in the world to ban 2C-I, 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 alongside 2C-B.

====Norway====
In Norway, 2C-B was classified as Schedule II on March 22, 2004, listed as 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.

====Poland====
2C-B is schedule I (I-P group) in Poland.

====Russia====
Banned as a narcotic drug with a criminal penalty for possession of at least 10 mg.

====Spain====
In Spain, 2C-B was added to Category 2 prohibited substances in 2002.

====Sweden====
2C-B is currently classified as Schedule I in Sweden.

2C-B was first classified as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act (Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of April 1, 1999, under SFS 1999:58 that made it illegal to sell or possess. Then it became schedule I as of June 1, 2002, published in LVFS 2002:4 but mislabeled &quot;2-CB&quot; in the document. However, this was corrected in a new document, LVFS 2009:22 effective December 9, 2009.

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland, 2C-B is listed in Anhang D of the DetMV and is illegal to possess.

====UK====
All drugs in the 2C family are Class A under the Misuse of Drugs Act which means they are illegal to produce, supply or possess. Possession carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment while supply is punishable by life imprisonment and an unlimited fine.

====United States====
In the United States, 2C-B is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. This became permanent law on June 2, 1995, following a proposal by the Drug Enforcement Administration in December 1994.

<doc id="428630" wikidata="Q749612" url="?curid=428630" title="Julian Lewis">
<text>Sir Julian Murray Lewis (born 26 September 1951) is a British Conservative Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for New Forest East since 1997. Lewis has served as Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) since 2020, succeeding Dominic Grieve.

Lewis previously served as Chair of the Defence Select Committee (HCDC), from 2015 to 2017 and from 2017 to 2019, and is the first Parliamentarian to have chaired both the ISC and the HCDC. He actively pursues the retention and renewal of the British strategic nuclear deterrent, the UK Trident programme – confirmed in 2016 – and campaigns for Defence expenditure to be restored to 3% of GDP. Lewis had the Conservative Party whip removed after successfully standing against Boris Johnson&#x27;s preferred candidate for the chairmanship of the Intelligence and Security Committee, former Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling, on 15 July 2020. The whip was restored on 30 December 2020.

A Eurosceptic, Lewis is a supporter of the pro-Brexit groups Leave Means Leave and the European Research Group (ERG). He was one of just 28 Conservative MPs (the &#x27;Spartans&#x27;) who voted all three times against Theresa May&#x27;s EU Withdrawal Agreement, regarding it as &quot;Brexit in Name Only&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Julian Lewis was born on 26 September 1951 in Swansea, into a Jewish family and son of a tailor and designer. He went to Dynevor Grammar School, competing in the school team for &quot;Television Top of the Form&quot;, broadcast on BBC1 on Thursday 2 June 1966, losing to Fairfield Grammar School, of Bristol, in the semi-finals. The school would also enter the radio competition the following year; to get to the semi-final, his team had beaten Malvern College (girls) on 19 May in the fourth heat.

He went to Balliol College, Oxford, receiving a BA, later promoted to MA, in Philosophy and Politics. He studied as a postgraduate at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, being awarded the DPhil in Strategic Studies for his thesis on &quot;British Military Planning for Post War Strategic Defence, 1942-1947&quot; in 1981.

From 1976 until early 1978, with secret funding from The Freedom Association, he posed as a Labour Party moderate and briefly won control of Newham North East Constituency Labour Party, in an eventually unsuccessful attempt to reverse the deselection of the sitting MP, Reg Prentice, and in order to highlight Militant tendency entryism in the Labour Party. Prentice himself later joined the Conservatives.

At the end of the Newham campaign, in 1978, Lewis returned to his studies at Oxford and joined the London Division of the Royal Naval Reserve, at HMS President, serving as a Seaman on the Southampton-based Ton-class minesweeper, .

Lewis became a leading opponent of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and other Left-wing organisations, throughout the 1980s. From 1981 to 1985, he was Research Director and then a Director of the Coalition for Peace through Security, set up to support the replacement of Polaris by Trident and the deployment of NATO cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common and RAF Molesworth, to counter the Soviet SS-20 missiles. This helped the achievement of President Reagan&#x27;s 1981 Zero Option proposal in the form of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

From the mid-1980s, Lewis was also Director of Policy Research Associates, working with Conservative and Crossbench members of the House of Lords to initiate changes to legislation (1) requiring postal ballots for trade union elections (incorporated in the 1984 Trade Union Act and 1988 Employment Act); (2) outlawing political indoctrination in schools (incorporated in the 1986 Education Act and carried forward in the 1996 Education Act); (3) prohibiting local councils from publishing material which &quot;promotes or opposes a point of view on a question of political controversy which is identifiable as the view of one political party and not of another&quot; (incorporated in Section 27 of the 1988 Local Government Act); and (4) more strictly defining the concept of &#x27;due impartiality&#x27; in the coverage of politically contentious issues on television and radio (incorporated in the 1990 Broadcasting Act).

==Parliamentary career==
Lewis stood as the Conservative candidate in Swansea West at the 1983 general election, coming second with 36.6% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP Alan Williams.

At the 1997 general election, Lewis was elected to Parliament as MP for New Forest East with 42.9% of the vote and a majority of 5,215.

In August 2000, Lewis attacked Conservatives defectors to Labour due to the party supporting Section 28, describing the &quot;gay lobby&quot; as supporting &quot;propaganda promoting homosexuality&quot; at the expense of taxpayers.

Lewis was re-elected as MP for New Forest East at the 2001 general election with a decreased vote share of 42.4% and a decreased majority of 3,829. He was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with an increased vote share of 48.6% and an increased majority of 6,551.

Although Lewis was repeatedly listed as amongst the lowest-claiming MPs (ranked 566th out of 647 in 2008/09), &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; alleged in May 2009 that he had tried to claim the £6,000 cost of a wooden floor in his second home. He maintained that: &quot;At no stage did I claim for the flooring and it did not cost the taxpayer a penny.&quot; A senior Commons official confirmed that, by seeking advice in advance about second home expenditure, he had acted &quot;in accordance with best practice as recommended by this department&quot; and that &quot;it is not true that you attempted to claim £6,000 in expenses for a wooden floor at your second home&quot;.

At the 2010 general election, Lewis was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 52.8% and an increased majority of 11,307.

With the creation of the Liberal-Conservative Coalition as a result of the election of a hung parliament in 2010, the post which he had shadowed (Minister for the Armed Forces) was allocated to the Liberal Democrat Defence spokesman, Nick Harvey MP. Lewis was appointed as a member of Parliament&#x27;s Intelligence and Security Committee in September 2010. He has also been a vice-chairman of the Conservative Friends of Poland.

Lewis has been described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;one of the most vigorous rightwingers in the Commons&quot; and by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as the Conservative Party&#x27;s &quot;front bench terrier&quot;. He was one of the Frontbenchers and Backbenchers of the Year chosen by commentators on the ConservativeHome website, in December 2009 and December 2010 respectively.

In February 2011, he strongly opposed, and was one of three Conservative MPs who voted against, Coalition plans to transfer heritage forests from public ownership to trusts. The plans were later disowned by the Government and abandoned.

In October 2011, he was one of 81 Conservative rebels who voted in favour of a referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership of the European Union and, in October 2012, he was one of 53 Conservative rebels voting to demand a real-terms cut in the EU budget. Both policies were later adopted by the party leadership.

In May 2014, he was one of eight candidates for the chairmanship of the House of Commons Defence Select Committee, coming second with 212 votes to the eventual winner&#x27;s 226. 

At the 2015 general election, Lewis was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 56.3% and an increased majority of 19,162.

On 17 June 2015, he was elected to chair the Defence Select Committee in a three-way contest with Richard Benyon and Colonel Bob Stewart. 

In November and December 2015, before and during the debate on bombing ISIL/Daesh in Syria, Lewis challenged David Cameron&#x27;s claim that there were 70,000 &quot;moderate&quot; Syrian fighters opposing ISIL/Daesh, describing the figure as &quot;magical&quot; and quoting expert commentators&#x27; views that the &quot;Free Syrian Army&quot; contained many Islamists. In the Commons debate on 2 December, Lewis stated that &quot;instead of having dodgy dossiers [as in the 2003 Iraq conflict], we now have bogus battalions of moderate fighters&quot;. He predicted that &quot;Once Daesh has been driven out... an Occupying Power will have to remain in control for many years to come... and only the Syrian Government Army is likely to provide it... Airstrikes alone are a dangerous diversion and distraction. What is needed is a grand military alliance involving not only the West but Russia and, yes, its Syrian Government clients too... We need to choose the lesser of two evils and abandon the fiction of a cosy third choice&quot; between &quot;very nasty authoritarians and Islamist totalitarians&quot;. After making this widely reported speech, Lewis voted against extending airstrikes against ISIL/Daesh into Syria in the absence of &quot;credible ground forces&quot;, and he continued to maintain that, apart from the Kurdish-led forces, in Syria the choice remained &quot;between monsters on the one hand, and maniacs on the other&quot;.

Lewis was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election with an increased vote share of 62.6% and an increased majority of 21,995. 

On 12 July 2017, he was again elected to chair the Defence Select Committee, by 305 votes to 265 votes, in a direct contest with Johnny Mercer. 

He was again re-elected at the 2019 general election with an increased vote share of 64.5% and an increased majority of 25,251. Lewis was again re-elected at the 2024 general election, with a decreased vote share of 38.5% and a decreased majority of 8,495.

===Accessibility===
Lewis is the only MP who does not allow his constituents to contact him by email. In a letter in &quot;The Guardian&quot; he stated: &quot;Letters, phone calls, and, where appropriate, surgery appointments are perfectly adequate for people who genuinely need my help, as the many letters of thanks quoted on my website fully confirm. Only mass, manipulative campaigners and obsessive individuals find this a problem – and so they should!&quot;

===Defence Committee Inquiries===
Among notable Inquiry reports produced under the chairmanship of Julian Lewis have been:

Shifting the Goalposts? Defence Expenditure and the 2% Pledge, published in April 2016, which concluded that the Government had met the minimum 2% NATO guideline only by counting &quot;several significant items not previously included when calculating defence expenditure&quot;, although doing so in accordance with NATO rules. The report set out, in detailed Annexes, the decline in UK expenditure on Defence as a proportion of GDP since the mid-1950s in comparison with that on Welfare, Health and Education. It also led to the subsequent adoption by the Defence Committee of a target of 3% of GDP to be spent on Defence, as in the mid-1990s. In July 2019, the Committee published an Update to Shifting the Goalposts?, which confirmed that defence expenditure had declined in successive years to 1.9% (2014–15), then 1.8% (2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18), when &quot;calculated on a historically consistent basis&quot;. Under the more generous NATO rules, the corresponding figures were 2.2% (2014–15), then 2.1% (2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18).

An Acceptable Risk? The Use of Lariam by Military Personnel, published in May 2016, which led to a significant reduction in the use of the anti-malarial drug mefloquine, and to the enforcement of stringent requirements before its prescription, on account of possible severe side-effects in some cases.

UK Military Operations in Syria and Iraq, published in September 2016, which revealed the great disparity between the large number of airstrikes being carried out in Iraq, where the UK was campaigning in support of substantial indigenous government ground forces, and the far lower total undertaken in Syria, where the UK could find only limited ground forces to support.

Open Source Stupidity – The Threat to the BBC Monitoring Service, published in December 2016, which strongly criticised the BBC&#x27;s plan to close the dedicated headquarters of the Monitoring Service at Caversham Park, condemned the UK Government&#x27;s previous decision to end its ring-fenced grant for the Service which had led to this outcome, and predicted that a state-owned Open Source Information Agency might eventually have to be established.

Investigations into Fatalities in Northern Ireland involving British Military Personnel, published in April 2017, which recommended the enactment of a Statute of Limitations coupled with a truth-recovery process as the best way to prevent the legal persecution of UK Service, Police and Security Personnel, decades after the events in question, whilst offering the best prospect of finding out what had actually happened during the Troubles.

Sunset for the Royal Marines? The Royal Marines and Amphibious Capability, published in February 2018, which excoriated the heavily trailed suggestion that the amphibious assault ships, HMS &quot;Albion&quot; and HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot;, would be removed from the Fleet 15 years early as part of the National Security Capability Review. The report described the proposal as &quot;a short-sighted, militarily illiterate manoeuvre totally at odds with strategic reality&quot;. After wide publicity, the plan was abandoned and the capability was saved.

Rash or Rational? North Korea and the Threat it Poses, published in April 2018, which concluded that Kim Jong-un is &quot;ruthless, like other Communist dictators before him, but he is rational&quot; and can be &quot;dissuaded from the use of nuclear weapons by means of a policy of deterrence and containment&quot; though &quot;unlikely to give them up now&quot;.

Lost in Translation? Afghan Interpreters and other Locally Employed Civilians, published in May 2018, which recommended &quot;a looser and more sympathetic approach&quot; to admitting threatened interpreters to the UK, given that it &quot;is impossible to reconcile the generosity of the Redundancy Scheme with the utter failure of the Intimidation Scheme to relocate even a single LEC to the United Kingdom&quot;. Subsequently, some liberalisation of the rules for relocation to the UK was introduced.

Beyond 2 per cent: A Preliminary Report on the Modernising Defence Programme, published in June 2018, which backed the removal of Defence from the &quot;fiscally neutral&quot; National Security Capability Review process – with its threats to impose further cuts on the Armed Forces, such as the deletion of the amphibious assault ships. The report recommended a financial settlement &quot;based on a level of Defence expenditure approaching the figure of 3% of GDP&quot;, which would demonstrate that the mantra &quot;Defence is the first duty of Government&quot; could finally be believed.

===Defence Committee innovations===
As well as those carried out by the full Defence Committee under his chairmanship, in 2015 Lewis initiated an arrangement for the Defence Sub-Committee to undertake separate individual inquiries chaired in turn by other members of the Defence Committee. Between 2016 and 2018 the Sub-Committee produced reports on military exercise deaths, the Iraq Historic Allegations Team and Defence in the Arctic.

In February 2018, Julian Lewis and his French counterpart Jean-Jacques Bridey agreed to launch a joint Inquiry by their respective committees into the UK-France future cruise/anti-ship weapon project. It was the first joint Inquiry to be held by a House of Commons Committee and a Committee of a non-UK legislature and reported in December 2018.

===Intelligence and Security Committee===
On 15 July 2020, Lewis was elected Chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament (ISC) with the support of the opposition MPs on the committee. He defeated Chris Grayling, who had been Boris Johnson&#x27;s preferred candidate. Lewis had the Conservative Party whip removed later that day for what a government source described as &quot;working with Labour and other opposition MPs for his own advantage&quot;; but Lewis stated that he had never responded to government whips about how he would vote, because he considered it an &quot;improper request&quot; as the 2013 Justice and Security Act explicitly removed the Prime Minister&#x27;s right to choose the committee chair: &quot;At no earlier stage did I give any undertaking to vote for any particular candidate&quot;. Although, the following day, the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said he would not rule out a plot to remove Lewis from the ISC, the government took no further action against him and restored the Conservative Party whip to him unconditionally on 30 December 2020.

==Military writings and honorary academic posts==
His essay on &quot;Nuclear Disarmament versus Peace in the 21st Century&quot; won the Trench Gascoigne Prize of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) in 2005. Two years later, Lewis won this prize for a second time, with an essay entitled &quot;Double-I, Double-N: A Framework for Counter-Insurgency&quot;.

His 10,000-word dissertation on &quot;The Future of the British Nuclear Deterrent&quot; was selected for an award and for publication as a Seaford House Paper by the Royal College of Defence Studies of which he was a Parliamentary member in 2006.

Lewis&#x27;s own most recent book, published in 2011, is a military biography &quot;Racing Ace – The Fights and Flights of &quot;Kink&quot; Kinkead DSO DSC* DFC*&quot;, published in 2011, recounting the adventurous life of a pioneering airman whose grave he found in his constituency. In choosing it as a &#x27;Book of the Year 2011&#x27; for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph Magazine&quot;, historian Andrew Roberts described Samuel Kinkead as &quot;one of the bravest airmen of the 20th century&quot;, and &quot;Racing Ace&quot; as &quot;exactly what an action biography should be&quot;.

Lewis&#x27;s critique of strategy in Afghanistan &quot;International Terrorism – The Case for Containment&quot; was published in the US military journal &quot;Joint Force Quarterly&quot; in April 2012.

In 2010, Lewis was appointed as a Visiting Senior Research Fellow, Centre for Defence Studies, Department of War Studies, King&#x27;s College, London; and, in 2019, he became an Honorary Professor, Strategy and Security Institute, University of Exeter.

==Honours==
Lewis was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in March 2015 and therefore granted the style The Right Honourable. He was knighted in the 2023 New Year Honours for political and public service.

<doc id="428633" wikidata="Q558376" url="?curid=428633" title="Drag and drop">
<text>In computer graphical user interfaces, drag and drop is a pointing device gesture in which the user selects a virtual object by &quot;grabbing&quot; it and dragging it to a different location or onto another virtual object. In general, it can be used to invoke many kinds of actions, or create various types of associations between two abstract objects.

As a feature, drag-and-drop support is not found in all software, though it is sometimes a fast and easy-to-learn technique. However, it is not always clear to users that an item can be dragged and dropped, or what command is performed by the drag and drop, which can decrease usability.

== Actions ==

The basic sequence involved in drag and drop is:
* Move the pointer to the object
* Press, and hold down, the button on the mouse or other pointing device, to &quot;grab&quot; the object
* &quot;Drag&quot; the object to the desired location by moving the pointer to this one
* &quot;Drop&quot; the object by releasing the button

Dragging requires more physical effort than moving the same pointing device without holding down any buttons. Because of this, a user cannot move as quickly and precisely while dragging (see Fitts&#x27; law). However, drag-and-drop operations have the advantage of thoughtfully chunking together two operands (the object to drag, and the drop location) into a single action.
Extended dragging and dropping (as in graphic design) can stress the mousing hand.

A design problem appears when the same button selects and drags items. Imprecise movement can cause an attempt to select an object to register as a dragging motion.

Another problem is that the target of the dropping can be hidden under other objects. The user would have to stop the dragging, make both the source and the target visible and start again. In classic Mac OS the top-of-screen menu bar served as a universal &quot;drag cancel&quot; target. This issue has been dealt with in Mac OS X with the introduction of Exposé.

== In Mac OS ==
Drag and drop, called click and drag at the time, was used in the original Macintosh to manipulate files (for example, copying them between disks or folders). System 7 added the ability to open a document in an application by dropping the document icon onto the application&#x27;s icon.

Apple added &quot;Macintosh Drag and Drop&quot; to System 7.5, extending &quot;click and drag&quot; to common clipboard operations like copying or moving textual content within a document. Content could also be dragged into the filesystem to create a &quot;clipping file&quot; which could then be stored and reused. Files could also be dropped on application windows, for example to enclose a document in an email, or add an image to a word processor document.

For most of its history Mac OS has used a single button mouse with the button covering a large portion of the top surface of the mouse. This may mitigate the ergonomic concerns of keeping the button pressed while dragging.

== In OS/2 ==
The Workplace Shell of OS/2 uses dragging and dropping extensively with the secondary mouse button, leaving the primary one for selection and clicking.
Its use like that of other advanced Common User Access features distinguished native OS/2 applications from platform-independent ports.

== In HTML ==

The HTML5 working draft specification includes support for drag and drop. HTML5 supports different kinds of dragging and dropping features including:
* Drag and Drop texts and HTML codes
* Drag and Drop HTML elements
* Drag and Drop files
Based on needed action, one of the above types can be used. Note that when an HTML element is dragged for moving its current position, its ID is sent to the destination parent element; so it sends a text and can be considered as the first group.

Google&#x27;s web-based e-mail application Gmail supports drag-and-drop of images and attachments in the latest Google Chrome browser and Apple&#x27;s Safari (5.x). Google Images permits users to drag and drop image files into a browser to perform a reverse image search.

== On a touch screen ==
Touch screen interfaces also include drag and drop, or more precisely, long press, and then drag, e.g. on the iPhone or Android home screens.

iOS 11 implements a drag-and-drop feature which allows the user to touch items (and tap with other fingers to drag more) within an app or between apps on iPads. On iPhones, the functionality is only available within the same app that the user started the drag.

== In end-user programming ==
Drag and drop is considered an important program construction approach in many end-user development systems. In contrast to more traditional, text-based programming languages, many end-user programming languages are based on visual components such as tiles or icons that are manipulated by end users through drag-and-drop interfaces. AgentSheets, a programming environment for kids, introduced the modern notion of drag and drop blocks programming providing 4 core affordances: 1) Blocks that are end-user composable, 2) blocks are end-user editable, 3) blocks can be nested to represent tree structures, 4) blocks are arranged geometrically to define syntax. Drag and drop is also featured in many shader editing programs for graphics tools, such as Blender. Drag and drop also features in some video game engines, including Unreal Engine, GameMaker Studio, Construct 2 and, with expansion, Unity.

== Examples ==

A common example is dragging an icon on a virtual desktop to a special trashcan icon to delete a file.

Further examples include:
* Dragging a data file onto a program icon or window for viewing or processing. For instance, dropping an icon that represents a text file into a Microsoft Word window signifies &quot;Open this document as a new document in Word&quot;
* Moving or copying files to a new location/directory/folder,
* Adding objects to a list of objects to be processed,
* Rearranging widgets in a graphical user interface to customize their layout,
* Dragging an attribute onto an object to which the command is to be applied,
** e.g. dragging a color onto a graphical object to change its color,
* Dragging a tool to a canvas location to apply the tool at that location,
* Creating a hyperlink from one location or word to another location or document.
* Most word processors allow dragging selected text from one point to another.
* Dragging a series of code blocks such as in Blender for designing shaders and materials.

<text>Ian Richard Peregrine Liddell-Grainger (born 23 February 1959) is a British Conservative Party politician and former property developer. He was MP for Bridgwater from 2001 until 2010, and until 2024, MP for Bridgwater and West Somerset. Through his mother, he is a great-great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria, third cousin of Charles III and second cousin once removed of Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.

==Early life and career==
Ian Liddell-Grainger was born on 23 February 1959 in Edinburgh to David Liddell-Grainger and Anne (née Abel Smith), whose mother was Lady May Abel Smith, great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. The Liddell-Grainger family were landed gentry, of Ayton Castle, Scottish Borders, formerly of Middleton Hall, Middleton, Northumberland. 

Liddell-Grainger was privately educated at Wellesley House School in Broadstairs and Millfield School in Somerset, before gaining a National Certificate of Agriculture at the South Scotland Agricultural College in Edinburgh. He ran a farm in the Scottish Borders from 1980 to 1985 before becoming the managing director of his family&#x27;s property management and development company.

Commissioned in the Territorial Army, Liddell-Grainger was promoted to major serving with the 6th Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, and commanded the Machine-Gun Platoon and then X Company of the Battalion in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

== Political career ==
In 1991, he was elected for the Conservative Party as a District Councillor on Tynedale District Council in Northumberland, representing the East Tynedale ward. He served until 1995, when Labour took the seat.

Liddell-Grainger stood as the Conservative candidate in Torridge and West Devon at the 1997 general election, coming second with 38.5% of the vote behind the Liberal Democrat candidate John Burnett.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 2001 general election, Liddell-Grainger was elected to Parliament as MP for Bridgwater with 40.4% of the vote and a majority of 4,987. He was re-elected as MP for Bridgwater at the 2005 general election with an increased vote share of 44.1% of the vote and an increased majority of 8,469.

In 2006, Liddell-Grainger was disqualified from the WriteToThem league table after faking e-mails and replies to himself to improve his &quot;responsiveness rating&quot; on a website which helps people contact their elected representatives. Liddell-Grainger&#x27;s spokesman commented that the e-mails had been sent to test the data that the website was judging him on.

Prior to the 2010 general election, Liddell-Grainger&#x27;s constituency of Bridgwater was abolished and replaced with Bridgwater and West Somerset. Liddell-Grainger was elected at the 2010 general election as MP for Bridgwater and West Somerset with 45.3% of the vote and a majority of 9,249.

At the 2010 general election, Liddell-Grainger declined to attend any election hustings or to take part in the BBC&#x27;s election coverage. A Facebook group was set up asking &quot;Where&#x27;s Ian Liddell-Grainger?&quot; Liddell-Grainger said that he was busy canvassing and dealing with casework.

The cancellation of plans to build new school buildings in Bridgwater in 2010 led Liddell-Grainger to threaten to &quot;march&quot; on Downing Street in protest. The cancellation of the Building Schools for the Future projects was one of the first acts by the newly elected coalition government&#x27;s Minister for Education Michael Gove. Liddell-Grainger claimed that Bridgwater&#x27;s schools were in need of rebuilding and that the plans, which had cancelled projects in three of the town&#x27;s six schools, were actually all under one project heading and had been working effectively. Gove was forced to apologise for a number of errors in the cancellation of the project nationally and the Bridgwater project was reconsidered by the government after Liddell-Grainger met Gove and it became apparent that Gove &quot;wasn&#x27;t aware of all the facts to do with the Bridgwater scheme&quot;.

In 2010, Liddell-Grainger criticised plans by the Environment Agency and Natural England to create a wetland habitat at Steart on the Severn estuary as part of a realignment of coastal flood defences. The project, which he said the nation &quot;should not and must not afford&quot;, went ahead in 2012.

Liddell-Grainger voiced opposition to wind power schemes in his constituency, including plans to build two wind turbines at Wiveliscombe in 2012. In March 2013 he supported the decision to allow planning permission to build a third nuclear power station at Hinkley Point.

At the 2015 general election, Liddell-Grainger was re-elected as MP for Bridgwater and West Somerset with an increased vote share of 46% and an increased majority of 14,583.

Liddell-Grainger is a member of the 18-strong British delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and currently heads one of the five political groups in the Assembly, the European Conservatives Group. He supported Brexit in the 2016 referendum.

At the snap 2017 general election, Liddell-Grainger was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 55.1% and an increased majority of 15,448.

In June 2018, he was accused of trivialising suicide by political rivals after shouting out that representatives of the SNP should consider &#x27;suicide&#x27; after the SNP&#x27;s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, asked John Bercow, the sitting speaker, a question about Scotland&#x27;s future following Brexit. He later defended his comments, stating he was referring to &#x27;political suicide&#x27;.

Liddell-Grainger chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Energy Studies, Nuclear Energy, the All-Party Pharmaceuticals group, the All-Party Dyslexia group, and the All-Party Tax group, and is also a member of the All Parliamentary Armed Forces Scheme with the Royal Air Force and the all Parliamentary Radio Group. He also sits on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee and has previously sat on the Public Administration Committee, the Environmental Audit Committee, the DEFRA select committee, the Statutory Instruments (Select/Joint Committees), the Scottish Committee as well as the Crossrail Bill Committee.

At the 2019 general election, Liddell-Grainger was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 62.1% and an increased majority of 24,439.

In the 2024 general election, he contested Tiverton and Minehead but was defeated by Liberal Democrat Rachel Gilmour.

==Political positions==
Liddell-Grainger was a member of the socially conservative Cornerstone Group, a ginger group within the Conservative Party. His interests included the economy, taxation, treatment for dyslexia, constitutional affairs and rural matters; he has also spoken in favour of making Herceptin available for early-stage breast cancer sufferers.

The Hinkley Point nuclear power stations are located in Liddell-Grainger&#x27;s former constituency. He believed that &quot;the nuclear power industry has truly embraced the energy future of our country&quot;, and that &quot;nuclear energy plays an important role in my constituency and is behind the creation of numerous jobs and training opportunities&quot;. 

Liddell-Grainger was the chairman of the European Conservatives Group and Democratic Alliance grouping in the Council of Europe and was reported to have pushed for the merger of the European Conservatives with the Democratic Alliance, which includes a number of parties described as &quot;far-right&quot;, such as Alternative for Germany and Italy&#x27;s Northern League, together with Brothers of Italy, the Freedom Party of Austria and the Sweden Democrats.

== Controversies ==
Liddell-Grainger was accused of abusive and bullying behaviour towards local councillors and council staff within his constituency. In 2010, he was reprimanded by the Conservative Party Leader and Chief Whip over his behaviour towards the former Chief Executive of Somerset County Council, whilst in 2015 the majority of Conservative West Somerset councillors backed calls for him to be de-selected for &quot;divisive&quot; and &quot;unsupportive&quot; behaviour. In March 2015, West Somerset Council leader Tim Taylor compiled a dossier of complaints, which was sent to the Conservative Party chairman and chief whip. Taylor described Liddell-Grainger as a &quot;disgrace to the Conservative Party&quot;. Despite this, Liddell-Grainger was re-selected for the following general election by the Conservative Association of Bridgwater and West Somerset.

In February 2014, in the context of flooding on the Somerset Levels, Liddell-Grainger called the chairman of the Environment Agency, Baron Smith of Finsbury a &quot;little git&quot;, and a &quot;coward&quot; and said he would like to &quot;stick his head down the loo and flush&quot;. The floods took place after exceptionally bad weather. Liddell-Grainger placed the blame for the floods on the Environment Agency&#x27;s policy of not dredging the local rivers, and said that he would be consulting with Dutch hydrological experts. The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management said increased dredging would not have prevented the flooding in the Somerset Levels – due to the sheer amount of water.

In September 2015, Liddell-Grainger criticised the Conservative run Somerset County Council for cutting services and carrying out wasteful reorganisations. The Leader of the Council responded that the MP&#x27;s comments were &#x27;ignorant and lacked understanding&#x27;, that the MP had refused to meet him to discuss the subject and that Government funding cuts were to blame for cuts to services.

In December 2016, he failed to renew his firearms licence on time for the shooting season. He had previously criticised young voters who had been unable to register to vote in the EU referendum because the government website crashed on the last day of registration, saying they should &#x27;pay the price for their own tardiness&#x27;. Liddell-Grainger blamed the police for his licence delay, criticising their &quot;utter incompetence&quot;. Following the incident, the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; published an article that asked if the actions of the MP, coupled with his continued electoral success, meant that he was &#x27;Somerset&#x27;s answer to Donald Trump&#x27;.

==Expenses==
Liddell-Grainger employs his wife as his Parliamentary Assistant on a salary up to £35,000. The practice of MPs employing family members was criticised by some sections of the media on the lines that it promotes nepotism. Although MPs who were first elected in 2017 have been banned from employing family members, the restriction is not retrospective – meaning that Liddell-Grainger&#x27;s employment of his wife is lawful. In 2010, he had included both his wife and his two eldest children on his list of staff, the only MP to do so at the time in the country.

Liddell-Grainger claimed a total of £166,109 in expenses, including for office, staffing and travelling costs, during 2007–8. In December 2009, he faced criticism for claiming expenses for a cleaner for his second home in London and for claiming £375-a-month on expenses for food. He responded that the figures were reasonable and proportionate. Later that month it was reported that he had been asked to pay back £3,200 of expenses payments he had claimed incorrectly. Under revised regulations, during 2010–11 he claimed the reduced sum of £147,004 for expenses, the sixth highest of all MPs in that year.

==Personal life==
Liddell-Grainger married Jill Nesbitt in 1985; she was his parliamentary secretary. The couple have three children.

In 2011, his family seat of Ayton Castle and its Scottish feudal barony of Ayton, Berwickshire was sold.

<text>Flores Island (; ) is an island of the Western Group () of the Azores.

It has an area of 143 km2, a population of 3428 inhabitants, and, together with Corvo Island of the western archipelago, lies within the North American Plate. The nearby Monchique Islet is the westernmost point of Portugal.

It has been referred to as the (&#x27;Yellow/Auburn Island&#x27;) and due to the association with poet Raul Brandão. It is well known for its abundance of flowers, hence its Portuguese name of .

== History ==

Some early accounts existed of the &quot;(seven) islands of the Azores and two islands of Flores&quot; (referring to the islands of Flores and Corvo), but no &quot;official discovery&quot; occurred until the mid-15th century. The island of Flores was discovered in the late summer of 1452 by the navigator Diogo de Teive and his son João de Teive, and first noted by the pilot Pêro Velasco to Christopher Columbus during his voyages. For his reward, Teive received the concession of the sugar monopoly on Madeira.

The earlier names of the island were São Tomás (after Thomas Becket of Canterbury, not to be confused with Saint Thomas, which in Portuguese is spelled Tomé) and Santa Iria (Saint Iria). The island&#x27;s charter passed to Fernão Teles de Meneses when little was accomplished in populating the islands, except for disembarking some sheep (1475). The death of Fernão Teles (1477) was to initiate exploration and settlement on the island, as his widow (Dona Maria de Vilhena) would contract the Flemish nobleman Willem van der Haegen to explore Flores and Corvo.

After meeting with Dona Maria Vilhena (who administered the island in the name of her young son, Rui de Teles), Van der Haegen came to an agreement and moved to the island between 1480 and 1490. Van der Haegen had arrived in the Azores in 1469 and lived for a time on Faial Island by invitation of the first Captain of Faial, Josse van Huerter. Following disagreements with van Huerter over land holdings, Van de Haegen settled in Quatro Ribeiras, Terceira until journeying to Ribeira da Cruz on Flores during the reign of King John II. The historians Gaspar Frutuoso and Diogo das Chagas noted that Van der Haegen cultivated lands (primarily for wheat export) and was involved in the indigo/woad industry, as well as exploring for mineral deposits (likely silver). Due to its isolated location outside shipping lanes, its intemperate climate, and infertile lands, he left Flores ten years later to resettle in Terceira by way of São Jorge Island. At the time, the name of the island was Corvo.

According to Bartolomé de las Casas, two dead bodies that looked like those of Amerindians were found on Flores. He said he found that fact in Columbus&#x27; notes, and it was one reason why Columbus presumed that India was on the other side of the ocean.

By 1504, the island&#x27;s charter had passed to João Fonseca and settlers streamed through the port of Armoeira to the small hamlets. The island became permanently populated during the reign of King Manuel I in the year 1510 by people from various regions of continental Portugal, mainly from the northern provinces. The island became arable and grain and vegetables were cultivated. Over the next centuries, the inhabitants lived in isolated parts of the island and were visited by vessels from Faial and Terceira which came infrequently to trade whale oil, butter, and honey for other products, or those caravels that stopped en route to Europe. Several of the main communities and local sites were named for settlers of this mid-century period, including Santa Cruz, Lajes and Ponta Delgada.

The name of the island of Flores has been made familiar to generations of English readers by the opening line of Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s epic poem, &quot;The Revenge, A Ballad of the Fleet&quot;: &quot;At Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay...&quot;, referring to the small English fleet of six ships (there were actually 22) under Lord Thomas Howard, anchored in the bay of Ribeira da Cruz in Flores, that on 9 September 1591 was surprised by 53 ships under Alfonso de Bazán. The English ships were part of a naval patrol intended to intercept Spanish ships from the Americas and were under repair and re-provisioning when the Spanish ships appeared. Five of the English ships slipped out to sea to the west of Corvo, but the &quot;Revenge&quot; (under Sir Richard Grenville) waited for her sick crew, many of whom had an epidemic of fever, to be returned from the shore, then decided to go straight through the approaching Spanish lines from the east. &quot;Revenge&quot; fought the Spanish ships for fifteen hours, resisting multiple attempts to board her. Her fatally wounded captain eventually ordered her to be scuttled, (&quot;Sink me the ship, Master Gunner — sink her, split her in twain! / Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!&quot;) but her crew instead negotiated an honourable surrender. (&quot;And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,/ Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,/ And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace...&quot;). The &quot;Battle of Flores&quot;, as it was known, culminated in the death of Grenville two days later and the &quot;Revenge&quot; became the only English ship to be captured during the Elizabethan conflict. However, the ship never reached Spain; it foundered during a storm near Terceira and went down with 200 Spaniards, along with several other Spanish ships.

Despite the isolation, the waters of Flores were frequently raided by pirates. Sir Walter Raleigh, the English privateer, was one of the early profiteers; he captured, after a bitter battle, the Portuguese carrack &quot;Madre de Deus&quot; laden with tonnes of spices, precious gems, and pearls, equivalent to half the public finances of the English court. Unusual for its time, the &quot;Madre de Deus&quot; was three times the capacity of a normal English brig, and the pirates towed it to the port of Dartmouth rather than destroying the ship.

The pirate Peter Easton, who commanded a fleet of 40 privateers, made Flores a regular port-of-call, provisioning meat, water and kindling for his travels and supposedly married a daughter of the Captaincy of Flores. Doubly inconvenienced with the damages caused by this pirate&#x27;s ships and with the complicity of local Florentines, Philip II of Portugal (Philip III of Spain) ordered, on July 30, 1611, the necessary means taken to capture Easton. He was never captured, although the local Florentine magistrate and Captain were arrested.
From the 1760s to the early 20th century, American whalers hunted sperm whales in the waters of the Azores, and many of the islands&#x27; inhabitants were recruited as whalers. The American whaler, &quot;Wanderer&quot;, operated off the coast of Flores between 1878 and 1924.

The &quot;CSS Alabama&quot;, an American Confederate States Navy ship, the most prolific commerce raider in the waters off Flores, was responsible for 69 sinkings in the course of two years beginning in the summer of 1862. Between 5 and 18 September 1862, it was responsible for capturing and setting ablaze the schooner &quot;Starlight&quot;, along with whalers off the coast of Flores.

The island&#x27;s isolation has been remedied during the 20th century, first with the installation of telegraph services, then the establishment of Radio-Flores (1909), and later with point-to-point telephone communication (1925). Service between the island and the rest of the archipelago was handled by small sailing ships until the beginning of the century, with ships such as the 36-ton yacht &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; or 80-ton yacht &quot;Flores&quot;, until the latter was lost in the bay of Porto Pim, Horta, Faial during a storm.

In July 1962, the French laid the foundations for a missile tracking installation on the island, which was inaugurated in October 1966. In the following years, a hospital, a power station, and an airport were established, which brought a financial upswing to the entire island. After the French left the island in 1994, tourism became the island&#x27;s dominant industry.

== Geography ==

Flores, along with the island of Corvo, is situated on the North American Continental Plate of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and belongs to the western group of islands in the Azores archipelago. Geomorphologically, the island is composed of two units:

* The Central Massif, in the central plain, has many maar structures with lake-filled craters in the adjacent lands;
* The Coastal Periphery includes the coastal zones, cliffs, and ancient beaches, as well as the coastal shelf.

The island developed initially from a submarine volcano from the Pleistocene epoch that constructed small calderas and numerous pyroclastic cones. Following a long period of quiescence beginning about 200,000 years ago, several young phreatomagmatic craters and associated lava flows erupted during the Holocene epoch, including two about 3000 years ago. The Funda de Lajes tuff ring, formed about 3150 years ago, accompanied by a lava flow that traveled toward the southeast reach the area of Lajes. The Caldeira Comprida tuff ring in Caldeira Seca (west-central Flores) later, about 2900 years ago, producing a lava flow that traveled towards the region of Fajã Grande.
Azevedo et al. (1986) divides the lavas and deposits into two major volcanic complexes:
* The Basal Volcanic Complex, which includes products and deposits of both submarine and subaerial volcanism, formed by pyroclastic deposits and inter-bedded flows of alkali basalts.
* The Upper Volcanic Complex represents the main sub-aerial activity composed of three main stratigraphic units, including basaltic to trachytic flows with interbedded pyroclastic deposits in the first two layers, and a more recent unit of exclusively pyroclastic deposits.

During the summer, the island is covered with hydrangeas, which have large blue or pink flowers; this is the origin of the island&#x27;s name (&quot;Flores&quot; is the Portuguese word for flowers).

The island has deep valleys and high peaks; Morro Alto is the highest place on the island, reaching an altitude of 914 metres, while Pico da Burrinha, Pico dos Sete Pés and Marcela are other peaks on the island. Flores has several inactive volcanoes; Caldeira Funda last erupted in 1200 BCE, and Caldeira Comprida in 950 BCE. In many situations where water collected in volcanic calderas (or &quot;caldeiras&quot; in Portuguese), lakes formed: there are seven of these lakes on the island. The Águas Quentes are small hot springs of boiling sulfurous water. The Gruta de Enxaréus is an enormous cavern, about 50 metres long and 25 metres wide.

==Environment==
===Ecoregions/protected areas===

Fajãzinha, in the municipality of Lajes das Flores, is a typical Azorean village that includes ruins of watermills. Nearby are several waterfalls which flow into the Ribeira Grande.

On May 27, 2009, Flores was chosen as one of the several areas to be included on the UNESCO list of World Network of Biosphere Reserves at the Man and the Biosphere Programme meeting held in Jeju, South Korea, along with the islands of Graciosa and Corvo. The program targets the ecological, social and economic dimensions of biodiversity loss and the reduction of this loss. It uses its World Network of Biosphere Reserves as vehicles for knowledge sharing, research and monitoring, education and training, and participatory decision-making with local communities.

On 13 October 2010, the Regional Secretary for Environment and Ocean () declared that the Rocha dos Bordões would be given a regional monument designation as part of an overall plan of integrating the Flores Nature Park (). The park is formed from the central plateau, descends in the northern coast and along the southern coast from Morro Alto, including the many lakes, ending at the Rocha dos Bordões. In the government&#x27;s decision, the regional secretary included an area &quot;especially rich in peat and humid zone vegetation&quot; together with the geological formation of the Rocha dos Bordões.

===Important Bird Area===
The island of Flores and the neighbouring Corvo Island, along with the surrounding waters, form the 210,400 ha Corvo and Flores Important Bird Area (IBA), designated as such by BirdLife International because it provides feeding and breeding sites for populations of Cory&#x27;s, little and Manx shearwaters, as well as roseate and common terns and, possibly, Madeiran storm petrels.

==Climate==
Under the Köppen climate classification, Flores Island has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) that transits into an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) at higher elevations. Its climate is largely influenced by the warm Gulf Stream and the surrounding ocean, resulting in a narrow temperature range and a wet climate. Winters are very mild and rainy with a February average of . Summers are warm to hot with the average temperature in August averaging during the day and during the night. Throughout the year, temperatures rarely exceed or fall below .

Precipitation is significant throughout the year, although summer months are drier than winter months. There are around 240 days with measurable precipitation. Humidity is constantly high (around 80% at sea level, increasing with altitude).

The microclimate of the forest park of Fazenda allows the development of a great number and variety of exotic species from all over the world.

==Human settlement==
Due to the generally rugged landscape of the island, many of the early settlements developed along the flatter coastal lands. The few settlements that are located in the interior are dotted by small homes or agricultural buildings.

Administratively, the island of Flores is divided into two municipalities (&quot;concelhos&quot; in Portuguese), which in turn are composed of several civil parishes, with their own civil committees and administrative executives:

*Santa Cruz das Flores, located in the north, has 2,020 inhabitants (2021 census), and includes the island&#x27;s largest community (Santa Cruz das Flores), a community located on the eastern coast, and where the local airport, as well as the principal governmental services, primary and secondary schools, and regional health centre are located. It comprises the following civil parishes:
** Caveira, the smallest parish in size, bordering Lajes das Flores, with 76 inhabitants;
** Cedros, the &quot;middle&quot; parish that straddles the river-valleys of Algoa Bay and historical location of orchards owing to its micro-climate;
** Ponta Delgada; third-largest community on the island, located along the northern coast;
** Santa Cruz das Flores; municipal seat, the location of the airport and largest population (with 1,552 inhabitants);
*Lajes das Flores, the southern municipality includes many of the natural landscapes of the island and is inhabited by approximately 1,408 inhabitants (2021 census). The principal parishes are:
** Fajã Grande, located in the basin and &quot;fajã&quot; on the western coast, with a population of 220 inhabitants;
** Fajãzinha, with 71 residents, is located south of Fajã Grande; &quot;Fajãzinha&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;fajã&quot;, referring to it being a small agglomeration of homes in the corner of the &quot;fajã&quot;;
** Fazenda, literally meaning &quot;commercial goods&quot; or &quot;location where [these] goods are available for sale&quot;, it was the last civil parish to be formed (de-annexed from its neighbour in 1919); with 261 people living in an area of 29.5 km²;
** Lajedo, an agricultural community located 9 km from Lajes, and close to the Rocha dos Bordões, as well as other natural monuments;
** Lajes das Flores, the seat of the municipal government, located on the southeast coast; largest population center in the municipality;
** Lomba, location of the island&#x27;s first chapel, and neighbor of the parish of Lajes. Lomba represents an area bordered by river valleys along the southern coast;
** Mosteiro, the smallest parish in area and density, with 19 residents, is the second smallest center on the island.

===Economy===
The economy of the island is mainly agricultural, with taro and grain cultivation the principal activities. Due to the early settlers being from northern Portugal, the island&#x27;s houses and streets resemble those found there. Portugal has a military agreement with France permitting France to have a base in the region. Santa Cruz das Flores houses the only airport on the island. While to the south of the village commercial fishermen operate out of the port and the ferry to Corvo Island is also based at Santa Cruz, the island&#x27;s primary commercial port is located in Lajes das Flores.

===Transport===

The island is serviced by the Flores Airport , a regional airport operated by ANA – Aeroportos de Portugal, and located in the centre of the parish of Santa Cruz das Flores. The airport is unique in dividing the parish in two: an area along the coast, separated by the airport, from the remaining residential homes and businesses along Monte and Pau Pique.

On 26 August 2012, the Regional Secretary for Science, Technology, and Equipment oversaw the requalification of of regional roadways on the island. The public works were intended to upgrade many of the island&#x27;s roads, considered the worst network in the Azores during the late part of the 20th century. An initial investment of 22 million euros had recuperated on the island prior to this, and of roadways were proposed to complete the improvements to the region.

===Culture===
In addition to the traditional meat and fish dishes that are popularly Azorean, the island&#x27;s own dishes include: &quot;Papa Grossa&quot;, &quot;Sopa de Agrião&quot;, &quot;Cozido de Porco&quot;, &quot;Molhos de Dobrada&quot;, &quot;Inhames com Linguiça&quot; and &quot;Feijões com Cabeça de Porco&quot;, as well as a local cheese and creamy butter. The fishery is also the base of seafood dishes such as &quot;Caldeirada de Congro&quot;, &quot;Bonito Assado no Forno&quot;, and &quot;Pasteis de Ervas Marinhas&quot;, in addition to Atlantic lobster, &quot;cavacos&quot;, crab, limpet and barnacles.

==Notable citizens==
* Diogo das Chagas (ca.1584 in Santa Cruz das Flores – ca.1661 in Angra do Heroísmo) was a Portuguese Franciscan friar and historian.
* José António Camões (Fajãzinha, 1777 – Ponta Delgada, 1827), priest, poet, historian, and author of various works of satire, including his heroic satire &quot;O Testamento de D. Burro, Pai dos Asnos&quot;, that poked fun at his critics, for their class-based antagonisms towards his illegitimacy. He was accused of damaging the reputation of the church, and brought before the inquisition, but absolved: yet, his antagonists had already destroyed his career, forcing him to live in disgrace off handouts from friends or church services, until his death.

<doc id="428640" wikidata="Q748837" url="?curid=428640" title="David Lidington">
<text>Sir David Roy Lidington (born 30 June 1956) is a former British politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Aylesbury from 1992 until 2019. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office from 2018 to 2019 and was frequently described as being Theresa May&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; Deputy Prime Minister.

Between 2010 and 2016, he served as Minister of State for Europe holding the position for the entirety of David Cameron&#x27;s premiership, a longer period than any of his predecessors. Theresa May appointed him to the cabinet for the first time in June 2016, where he held a number of roles including Leader of the House of Commons, and the joint title of Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice. He resigned from the government on 24 July 2019, in anticipation of the appointment of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister. He did not seek reelection in the 2019 general election.

==Early life and career==
Born in Lambeth, Lidington was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; Prep School and later at Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School. He studied Modern History at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. His PhD was entitled &quot;The Enforcement of the Penal Statutes at the Court of the Exchequer c. 1558 - c. 1576&quot;. 

While at Cambridge, he was chairman of Cambridge University Conservative Association and Deputy President of the Cambridge University Students&#x27; Union. He was the Captain of the Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge team that won the 1979 series of &quot;University Challenge.&quot; The team also won the 2002 &quot;University Challenge – Reunited&quot; &quot;champion of champions&quot; series for the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

Lidington&#x27;s early employment included posts with BP and the Rio Tinto Group before being appointed in 1987 as special adviser to the then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd. He moved to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1989 when Hurd was appointed Foreign Secretary.

In the 1987 general election, Lidington stood unsuccessfully in the Vauxhall constituency.

==Parliamentary career==
===From 1992 to 2010===
Lidington was selected as the Conservative candidate for the safe seat of Aylesbury in December 1990. He became the constituency&#x27;s member of parliament at the 1992 general election.

At Westminster, Lidington previously participated in the Education Select Committee and Conservative Backbench Home Affairs Committee. In 1994, he successfully promoted a Private Members Bill which became the Chiropractors Act 1994.

Lidington first joined the Conservative front bench team in August 1994, when he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Home Secretary Michael Howard. In June 1997, with the Conservatives in opposition, he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Leader of the Opposition William Hague. Two years later, in June 1999, he was promoted to become Shadow Home Affairs Minister (deputy to Ann Widdecombe). In September 2001, Lidington was promoted to become Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury.

====Shadow Cabinet====
Lidington became a member of the Shadow Cabinet in May 2002, replacing Ann Winterton as Shadow Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (later Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) after she resigned. When Michael Howard was elected Conservative Party leader in November 2003, Lidington became Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, but was not included as a member of the Shadow Cabinet.

In May 2005, Howard enlarged the Shadow Cabinet, granting Lidington the right to attend it again. He continued to serve as the Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under David Cameron. On 2 July 2007, was appointed as a Shadow Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.

====Expenses (2009)====
In May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; revealed Lidington had claimed nearly £1,300 for his dry cleaning and had also claimed for toothpaste, shower gel, body spray and vitamin supplements on his second home allowance. Lidington repaid the claims.

Lidington was also criticised by local newspaper the &quot;Bucks Herald&quot; for claiming £115,891 in expenses in one year, almost double his salary.

===Since the 2010 general election===
Following the 2010 general election, Lidington was appointed Minister for Europe. In August 2016 following the resignation of David Cameron, Lidington was appointed a CBE in the 2016 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours for his services to the government as European minister.

In November 2013, Lidington was criticised in an editorial of the local newspaper the &quot;Bucks Herald&quot; after he abstained on votes on the HS2 rail project which will run through his constituency.

On 7 December 2016, when he was serving as Leader of the House of Commons, Lidington deputised for Prime Minister Theresa May at PMQs questioned first-hand by the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry who also deputised, as per custom, for Jeremy Corbyn on the day.

Under Prime Minister Theresa May, Lidington was appointed Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council. This was a position he held till 11 June 2017, when he was promoted to Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor. His appointment was criticised due to his record on LGBT rights, having opposed scrapping the ban on &#x27;promotion of homosexuality&#x27; in schools, as well as civil partnerships. During the debate on the legalisation of same-sex marriage he argued that &quot;marriage was for the procreation of children&quot; and that the &quot;definition of marriage should not be changed without an extremely compelling case for doing so&quot;. He later said that he regretted voting against civil partnerships.

On 8 January 2018, during a cabinet reshuffle, Lidington became the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office. Several media outlets subsequently referred to Lidington as Theresa May&#x27;s de facto Deputy Prime Minister and a candidate for her succession. Despite this, Lidington said that he had &#x27;no wish&#x27; to become Prime minister, stating that Theresa May was &#x27;doing a fantastic job&#x27;. On 24 July 2019, Lidington resigned as Cabinet Office Minister and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and on 10 September, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in Theresa May&#x27;s resignation honours &quot;for political and public service&quot;.

During the 2019 Conservative leadership election, Lidington backed Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart. At the final stage of the leadership election, he supported Jeremy Hunt over Boris Johnson.

Writing in his local newspaper, the &quot;Bucks Herald&quot;, on 30 October 2019, Lidington said he was not planning to seek re-election at the next general election. Lidington officially stepped down as the MP for Aylesbury on 6 November 2019.

==Personal life==
Lidington and his wife Helen have four sons. He was raised as a Congregationalist but is now an Anglican.

Prior to becoming an MP, Linton was a journalist for the &quot;Guardian&quot; from 1981 to 1997, and was a councillor in Wandsworth from 1971 to 1982.

During his career in journalism, he worked for &quot;Daily Mail&quot; (1966–71), &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, &quot;Labour Weekly&quot; (1971–79) and the &quot;Daily Star&quot; (1980–81).

==Parliamentary career==
He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Baroness Blackstone in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) from 2001 to 2003, and to Peter Hain as Leader of the House of Commons from 2003 to 2005. After the 2005 General Election he was made a PPS again, this time in the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA).

He is Treasurer of British-Swedish Parliamentary Association and Vice-Chairman of All-Party British-Swedish Group, reflecting his Swedish roots.

After the 2005 general election, his majority stood at 163, one of the Commons&#x27; smallest in that parliament.

He visited the West Bank and Gaza in September 2007 with the Britain-Palestine All Party Parliamentary Group. Following that visit, Linton founded and currently chairs Labour Friends of Palestine &amp; the Middle East. The organisation is committed to a two-state solution with secure Palestinian and Israeli states. He has visited Israel and Gaza three times to campaign for peace talks.

Active on a number of environmental issues, he successfully lobbied the government to target a cut of 80% in Carbon emissions by 2050 rather than a cut of 60%. Linton opposed plans to build a third runway at Heathrow He signed a number of Early Day Motions supporting tougher action on environmental issues and has promised to reduce his personal carbon emissions by 10% as part of the 10:10 campaign.

Linton has campaigned for electoral reform for a number of years and wrote &quot;Labour&#x27;s Road to Electoral Reform: What&#x27;s Wrong with First-Past-the-Post?&quot; (with Mary Georghiou, 1993) and &quot;Making Votes Count: The Case for Electoral Reform&quot; (1998). The government backed one of Martin&#x27;s amendments in February 2010 which puts the Labour party&#x27;s commitment to a referendum on the alternative vote system into legislation. Linton does not believe that tax exiles should be able to donate to political parties, and has lobbied for an enquiry into whether Lord Ashcroft breached the House of Lords code of conduct.

He voted for MPs&#x27; expenses to be made more transparent since 2007, and was ranked the 13th lowest spending MP by an independent think tank

In March 2010, Linton drew criticism for remarks he made to a meeting at the House of Commons held by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and Friends of al-Aqsa, in which he stated that: 

“There are long tentacles of Israel in this country who are funding election campaigns and putting money into the British political system for their own ends...when you make decisions about how you vote and how you advise constituents to vote, you must make them aware of the attempt by Israelis and by pro-Israelis to influence the election.”

At the 2010 General Election, he lost his seat to Jane Ellison of the Conservative Party.

==Personal life==
He lives in Battersea with his wife Sara (married July 2008) and his two stepdaughters. His first wife Kathy, with whom he had two children, died in 1995. His great-grandfather, Sydney Linton, was the inaugural Bishop of Riverina, New South Wales, Australia.

<text>Montreuil-sur-Mer (; or ; ), Montreuil-on-the-Sea, is a subprefecture in the Pas-de-Calais Department in northern France. Though commonly called by this name since at least the twelfth century, it was legally known as Montreuil until 31 December 2022. It is located on the Canche river, not far from Étaples. The sea, however, is now some distance away. Montreuil-sur-Mer station has rail connections to Arras and Étaples.

==History==
Montreuil-sur-Mer is surrounded by notable brickwork ramparts, constructed after the destruction of the town by troops of Habsburg emperor Charles V in June 1537. These fortifications pre-date the extensive fortification of towns in northern France by Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban in the 17th century.
Montreuil-sur-Mer was the headquarters of the British Army in France during the First World War from March 1916 until it closed in April 1919. The military academy there provided excellent facilities for GHQ.

Montreuil-sur-Mer was chosen as GHQ for a wide variety of reasons. It was on a main road from London to Paris—the two chief centres of the campaign—though not on a main railway line, which would have been an inconvenience. It was not an industrial town and so avoided the complications alike of noise and of a possibly troublesome civil population. It was from a telephone and motor transit point of view in a very central situation to serve the needs of a Force which was based on Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne, Dieppe, and Le Havre, and had its front stretching from the River Somme to beyond the Belgian frontier.

Haig staff member Sir Frank Fox OBE wrote a critically acclaimed contemporary account of the headquarters in 1916, originally published under the pseudonym &quot;GSO&quot;, called G.H.Q. (Montreuil-sur-Mer) His work in the QMG&#x27;s Directorate in the final offensive against the German Army resulted in his being awarded the OBE (Military) He was also Mentioned in Despatches.

General Haig was quartered in the nearby Château de Beaurepaire, southeast of the town on the D138. There is a plaque on the château wall to commemorate this.

King George V, accompanied by Haig, made a triumphant passage through Montreuil-sur-Mer on his way to Paris on 27 November 1918.

A statue of Haig on horseback, commemorating his stay, can be seen outside the theatre on the Place Charles de Gaulle. During the German occupation of the town during the Second World War, the statue was taken down. It was never found and is thought to have been melted down. It was rebuilt in the 1950s, using the sculptor&#x27;s original mould.

==Demographics==
==Literature==
Laurence Sterne visited the town in 1765. He recounted his visit through the eyes of the narrator of his novel &quot;A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy&quot; (1768).

In Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1862), Montreuil-sur-Mer is the setting for much of volume I, &quot;Fantine,&quot; being the hometown of the eponymous heroine. In early English-language editions, the town is identified only as M____-sur-M__, and the name is changed entirely in some film adaptations. E.g., the 1998 film directed by Bille August calls it &quot;Vigaud,&quot; a pun on Victor Hugo. However, the English-language version of the popular Schönberg-Boublil musical, and all screen adaptations thereof, restore the full name in the on-screen title cards, although it is never spoken in the libretto.

==International relations==
Montreuil-sur-Mer is twinned with Slough, England, UK.

<text>Point and click are one of the actions of a computer user moving a pointer to a certain location on a screen (&quot;pointing&quot;) and then pressing a button on a mouse or other pointing device (&quot;click&quot;). An example of point and click is in hypermedia, where users click on hyperlinks to navigate from document to document. User interfaces, for example graphical user interfaces, are sometimes described as &quot;point-and-click interfaces&quot;, often to suggest that they are very easy to use, requiring that the user simply point to indicate their wishes. Describing software this way implies that the interface can be controlled solely through a pointing device with little or no input from the keyboard, as with many graphical user interfaces.
In some systems, such as Internet Explorer, moving the pointer over a link (or other GUI control) and waiting for a split-second will cause a tooltip to be displayed.

== Single click ==
A single click or &quot;click&quot; is the act of pressing a computer mouse button once without moving the mouse. Single clicking is usually a primary action of the mouse. Single clicking, by default in many operating systems, selects (or highlights) an object while double-clicking executes or opens the object. The single-click has many advantages over double click due to the reduced time needed to complete the action. The single-click or one-click phrase has also been used to apply to the commercial field as a competitive advantage. The slogan &quot;single click&quot; or &quot;one-click&quot; commonly advertises services&#x27; ease of use.

===On icons===
By default on most computer systems, for a person to select a certain software function, they will have to click on the left button. An example of this can be a person clicking on an icon. Similarly, clicking on the right button will present the user with a text menu to select more actions. These actions can range from open, explore, properties, etc. In terms of entertainment software, point-and-click interfaces are common input methods, usually offering a &#x27;menu&#x27; or &#x27;icon bar&#x27; interface that functions expectedly. In other games, the character explores different areas within the game world. To move to another area, the player will move the cursor to one point of the screen, where the cursor will turn into an arrow. Clicking will then move the player to that area.

===On text===
In many text processing programs, such as web browsers or word processors, clicking on text moves the cursor to that location. Clicking and holding the left button allows users to highlight the selected text. This enables more options to edit or use the text.

== Double click ==

A double click is most commonly used with a computer mouse when the pointer is placed over an icon or object and the button is quickly pressed twice without moving the mouse.

==Fitts&#x27;s Law==
Fitts&#x27;s law can be used to quantify the time required to perform a point-and-click action.

formula_1
where:
* formula_2 is the average time taken to complete a single movement.
* formula_3 represents the start/stop time of the device and formula_4 stands for the inherent speed of the device. These constants can be determined experimentally by fitting a straight line to measured data.
* formula_5 is the distance from the starting point to the center of the target.
* formula_6 is the width of the target measured along the axis of motion. formula_6 can also be thought of as the allowed error tolerance in the final position since the final point of the motion must fall within formula_8 of the target&#x27;s centre.

<text>Sir Anthony Joseph Lloyd (25 February 1950 – 17 January 2024) was a British Labour politician. He served as a member of Parliament (MP) for 36 years, making him one of the longest-serving MPs in recent history. He served as MP for Stretford from 1983 to 1997, Manchester Central from 1997 to 2012, and represented Rochdale from 2017 until his death in 2024. He was Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner between 2012 and 2017 and served as the interim Mayor of Greater Manchester in his last two years in the role.

Born in Stretford, Lloyd served as a Trafford councillor from 1979 to 1984. In 1983 he was elected MP for Stretford, representing the constituency until it was abolished in 1997, at which time he was elected for Manchester Central. As an MP, Lloyd was an opposition spokesman between 1987 and 1997, a minister of state in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office between 1997 and 1999, and Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party from 2006 to 2012.

Lloyd continued as a constituency MP until October 2012, when he stepped down to contest the 2012 police and crime commissioner elections for the Greater Manchester Police area. He was elected and assumed the position in November 2012. Lloyd, appointed interim mayor of Greater Manchester in 2015, announced in 2016 that he would be seeking to become the Labour Party candidate in the Greater Manchester mayoral election, but lost the nomination to Andy Burnham before being elected as MP for Rochdale in 2017.

Lloyd served as Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 2018 and 2020, resigning to recover from his illness of COVID-19. He was also Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland between 2019 and 2020. In 2011, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; listed Lloyd among its 250 Most Influential People in Greater Manchester, describing him as &quot;a major figure on Labour politics in Greater Manchester&quot;, and &quot;the most powerful man in Greater Manchester&quot; on his election as police and crime commissioner in 2012. In a directory of MPs produced by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Andrew Roth described Lloyd as &quot;well informed, thoughtful and realistic regionalist and internationalist&quot;.

==Background and family life==
Lloyd was born in Stretford on 25 February 1950, the fourth of five children of Sydney Lloyd and his wife, Cecily (&quot;née&quot; Boatte). He was raised in Stretford, and attended Stretford Grammar School for Boys, the University of Nottingham (where he gained a BSc degree in mathematics in 1972), and Manchester Business School (where he studied for an MBA degree), before becoming a lecturer in Business Studies at the University of Salford.

Lloyd&#x27;s father died when he was 13, leaving his mother Cecily, a staunch supporter of the Labour Party, to shape his values. Lloyd said: &quot;My mother had friends who died in the Spanish Civil War. I saw that as a simple battle of good versus evil and in that sense the basic morality of politics was instilled in me. I have always thought if not fighting for what&#x27;s right and just, then what is politics for?&quot;

==Political career==
===Trafford Council===
Lloyd was first elected to public office when he stood as a Labour Party candidate in the 1979 Trafford Council election, winning a seat on Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council representing the Clifford ward on 4May 1979 (the day Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom). Lloyd remained a Trafford councillor until 1984, rising to the rank of Deputy Labour Council Leader.

===House of Commons===
Lloyd entered the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Stretford on 9June 1983, after the 1983 general election. He was an opposition whip between 1986 and 1987, and became the opposition spokesman for transport (1987–1992), employment (1992–1994), the environment (1994–1995), and foreign affairs (1995–1997).

Constituency boundaries were reformed for the 1997 general election, and Lloyd was selected for the Manchester Central constituency, where he was returned at each subsequent general election up to and including 2010. Following the 1997 general election which returned Tony Blair as Prime Minister, Lloyd was appointed a junior Minister of State in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office under Robin Cook, beginning on 5May 1997. In 1998, an inquiry by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee into the supply of arms from Sandline International to Africa during the Sierra Leone Civil War led to accusations that Lloyd had been dishonest and lacked depth over the trade of illicit weaponry. Lloyd&#x27;s position at the Foreign Office ended in a government reshuffle on 28 July 1999.

Lloyd remained a &quot;powerful&quot; backbencher, and on 5December 2006 became Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Partya post which leads all Labour MPs, both government and backbench MPsby defeating the incumbent, Ann Clwyd, who was perceived as being too close to Blair. When he unseated Clwyd, the feud between Blair and Gordon Brown was much reportedLloyd, was described by journalist Michael White as a &quot;Brownite ally&quot;, and Labour advisor Jonathan Powell wrote that Lloyd was a key member of Brown&#x27;s &quot;team of henchmen on the Labour backbenches to oppose Tony [Blair]&quot;. Lloyd was a Member of the North West Regional Select Committee from 4March 2009 to 11 May 2010. After revelations arising from the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, Lloyd was forced to apologise for over-claiming £2,210 in rent on his flat in London, adding it was &quot;a genuine error&quot;. As Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Lloyd wrote to Labour MPs urging them to publish all expenses claims.

Lloyd voted for Bryan Gould and John Prescott respectively in the Labour Party leadership elections of 1992 and 1994. Although the TheyWorkForYou political activities website declares that Lloyd &quot;hardly ever rebels&quot;, he voted against Labour&#x27;s national agenda in key areas while an MP. He joined rebel Labour MPs by voting against government policy regarding the Iraq War, and rebelled against government policy to detain terror suspects for 90 days without trial. He voted against government policy to introduce student tuition fees, and as an &quot;anti-nuclear and anti-war campaigner&quot;, voted against the renewal or replacement of the UK Trident programme in 2007. Lloyd was strongly in favour of and voted for the reform of the House of Lords, the Identity Cards Act 2006, and the expansion of London Heathrow Airport. Lloyd supported the bid for a proposed supercasino for East Manchester, and was furious with the House of Lords and Gordon Brown for axing the scheme, adding it was &quot;grossly unfair and outrageous&quot; and that &quot;those who kicked it into touch deprived a community with one of the highest levels of unemployment the opportunity to access well paid jobs and proper training&quot;. He supported the proposed Greater Manchester congestion charge, and campaigned in its favour in the 2008 referendum on the Greater Manchester Transport Innovation Fund, which was &quot;overwhelmingly rejected&quot; by voters.

Lloyd was the leader of the British delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and one of its vice-presidents, a leader of the British delegation to the Western European Union, and leader of the British delegation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). He was head of the OSCE at a time when it was monitoring the 2010 Belarusian presidential election, which it denounced as fraudulent; Lloyd said the &quot;election failed to give Belarus the new start it needed&quot;, adding &quot;the people of Belarus deserved better&quot;. Lloyd was Chair of the Trade Union Group of Labour MPs from 2002 to 2012.

Lloyd contributed chapters about John Robert Clynes and George Kelley, Labour members of Parliament for Manchester elected in 1906, to &quot;Men Who Made Labour&quot;, edited by Alan Haworth and Diane Hayter, and contributed a piece on the future of the Labour Party in the 2011 book &quot;What Next for Labour? Ideas for a new generation&quot;.

===Police and Crime Commissioner===

Lloyd was described by Andrew Roth of &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;realistic regionalist&quot;; he supported the creation of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority in 2011, but disagreed that there should be an elected Mayor of Greater Manchester. On 15 February 2012, Lloyd announced his intention to resign as a member of Parliament to stand as a candidate for the directly elected Police and Crime Commissioner for Greater Manchester. Lloyd said he was willing to leave the Manchester Central constituencya Labour safe seatfor the PCC role because in &quot;all the years I have been a MP, one of the abiding issues that people raised with me was fear of crime&quot;. The resulting 2012 Manchester Central by-election was scheduled for the same November polling day. In the 2012 Police and Crime Commissioner elections, Lloyd was elected as the inaugural Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner, winning with 139,437 votes, a share of 51.23% and approximately 7% of the electorate, prompting the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; to quip that he had become &quot;the most powerful man in Greater Manchester&quot;.

As Police and Crime Commissioner for Greater Manchester, Lloyd was one of the Labour Party&#x27;s highest-profile commissioners, overseeing one of the largest police services in England and Wales outside of Greater London. He received £100,000 per year, the largest salary of any English or Welsh Police and Crime Commissioner. He was based at Salford Civic Centre and was required to devise a five-year strategic plan for Greater Manchester Police and hold Sir Peter Fahy, the force&#x27;s chief constable, to account. On hearing the news that Lloyd had won the election, Fahy said &quot;one of the key roles of the PCC was negotiating and influencing the other local authorities, the health service, businesses and other organisations... We will be expecting him to fight for GMP at a national level with the Home Office over resourcing and changes to legislation&quot;. At the end of March 2013, Lloyd published the &quot;Police and Crime Plan 2013–2016&quot;, setting his nine priorities for policing Greater Manchester. These were:

The plan outlined Lloyd&#x27;s vision &quot;for all of us in Greater Manchester to work together to build the safest communities in Britain&quot;.

===Interim Mayor for Greater Manchester===
Lloyd was appointed interim Mayor for Greater Manchester on 29 May 2015. He subsequently announced that he would be running to become the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate for the 2017 Greater Manchester mayoral elections on 11 February 2016.

On 9 August, Andy Burnham was selected with 51.1% of the vote. Lloyd came second with 29.1%.

===Return to the Commons===

In May 2017, Lloyd was selected to stand as the Labour Party&#x27;s parliamentary candidate for Rochdale at the 2017 general election. He was selected after the incumbent MP, Simon Danczuk, was disallowed from standing again as the Labour candidate, owing to an ongoing internal party investigation into Danczuk&#x27;s personal conduct. Lloyd was elected with a majority of 14,819.

On 3 July 2017, Lloyd was appointed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as a Shadow Housing Minister. On 23 March 2018, Lloyd became Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, replacing the sacked Owen Smith.

In December 2019, Lloyd became the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, replacing Lesley Laird. Upon Sir Keir Starmer&#x27;s election as Labour leader in spring 2020, Lloyd was replaced in this post by Ian Murray but continued as Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Louise Haigh replaced him on an interim basis in April 2020 after he was admitted to hospital with coronavirus.

Following his discharge from Manchester Royal Infirmary Lloyd stood down from his front bench role to concentrate on his recovery from COVID-19, but vowed to continue his work as a constituency MP.

On 15 February 2021, Lloyd undertook godparenthood for Darya Chultsova, Belarusian journalist and political prisoner.

Lloyd was knighted in the 2021 Birthday Honours for public service.

==Personal life==

Lloyd married Judith Tear in 1974. They had three daughters and a son. As a supporter of Manchester United, in March 2011 he tabled an early day motion in the House of Commons for their player Ryan Giggs to be knighted.

===Illness and death===
In January 2023, Lloyd revealed that he was undergoing chemotherapy after a recent cancer diagnosis. He said he would not attend Parliament or attend face-to-face functions under medical advice to socially isolate and avoid meetings.

In January 2024, Lloyd announced that he had chosen to end hospital treatment, following his cancer developing into an &quot;aggressive and untreatable leukaemia&quot;. On 17 January, he died in the early morning at his home in Manchester, as a result of his illness. He was 73. Tributes were paid to Lloyd in the House of Commons on 23 January.

<text>Timothy Paul Loughton, ( ; born 30 May 1962) is a British politician and former banker who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for East Worthing and Shoreham from 1997 to 2024. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children and Families from 2010 to 2012 and has twice served as the Acting Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee in 2016 and 2021, following the respective resignations of Keith Vaz and Yvette Cooper.

In April 2024, Loughton announced that he would not seek re-election as an MP at the 2024 general election.

==Early life and career==
Timothy Loughton was born on 30 May 1962 in Eastbourne, East Sussex. From 1973 to 1980, he was educated at Priory School, a state comprehensive school in Lewes, East Sussex. From 1980 to 1983, he studied classical civilisation at the University of Warwick. He was the secretary of the University of Warwick Conservative Association. He graduated with a first class honours Bachelor of Arts (BA Hons) degree in 1983. He then attended Clare College, Cambridge, where he studied Mesopotamian archaeology between 1983 and 1984.

Loughton subsequently had a career in the City of London as a fund manager from 1984 for Fleming Private Asset Management, becoming a director from 1992 to 2000.

==Parliamentary career==
===Early career===
Loughton unsuccessfully contested Sheffield Brightside for the Conservative Party at the 1992 general election, finishing in second with 16.8% behind the incumbent Labour MP David Blunkett. 

Loughton was elected as MP for East Worthing and Shoreham at the 1997 general election, winning with 40.5% of the vote and a majority of 5,098.

From 2000 to 2001, Loughton was Shadow Minister for Environment and from 2003 to 2010 he was Shadow Minister of Health and Children, during the Conservative Party&#x27;s time as the shadow cabinet in opposition to the Labour Party.

At the 2001 general election, Loughton was re-elected as MP for East Worthing and Shoreham with an increased vote share of 43.2% and an increased majority of 6,139. He was again re-elected at the 2005 general election with an increased vote share of 43.9% and an increased majority of 8,183.

In 2010, Loughton appeared in the Channel 4 documentary series, &quot;Tower Block of Commons&quot;.

===Ministerial career===
Loughton was again re-elected at the 2010 general election with an increased vote share of 48.5% and an increased majority of 11,105. After the election, Loughton was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Children and Families, a position commonly known as &#x27;children&#x27;s minister&#x27;.

In February 2012, Loughton was part of a ministerial working group on how the law should be changed regarding how to amend the Children Act 1989. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 3 February 2012, the working group aimed to include in the new Children&#x27;s Act one &quot;presumption of shared parenting&quot; for children&#x27;s fathers and mothers after cases of divorce or spousal break up.

In May 2012, he said marriage was a religious institution that should remain between one man and one woman. Loughton voted against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill. 

Loughton was dismissed as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Children and Families in the government reshuffle of September 2012.

===Backbench career===
In January 2013, Loughton was involved in a political dispute involving his earlier work as a minister in the Department for Education (DofE) when he compared the role of Education Secretary Michael Gove to &quot;Young Mr Grace&quot; from the British sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, suggesting there was little interaction between ministers and staff in the department. The next day Loughton was described in an anonymous briefing from the DofE to &quot;The Spectator&quot; as a &quot;lazy, incompetent narcissist obsessed only with self-promotion&quot;. The following month Loughton tabled &quot;hostile&quot; parliamentary questions to the Department of Education on the subject of complaints by staff, which &quot;The Independent&quot; described as &quot;a significant escalation of hostilities&quot; between Loughton and some of his old colleagues.

In March 2013, it was reported that Loughton had been investigated by Sussex Police under the Malicious Communications Act following a complaint lodged by a constituent over Loughton&#x27;s reply to their email. After several months, Loughton was advised by the Sussex Police that they would not be filing any charges. Loughton subsequently gave his account of the affair in a parliamentary privilege protected House of Commons speech and criticised the police response. Loughton then mailed a Hansard copy of the speech to the constituent, an action he believed was covered by parliamentary privilege.

The constituent lodged another complaint about being sent the parliamentary papers, and Loughton was issued with a Police Information Notice (PIN) by Sussex Police. Loughton then arranged an emergency parliamentary debate, during which he accused the police of violating parliamentary privilege by issuing the PIN. A motion for the Standards and Privileges Committee to investigate his claims was granted. At a hearing of the Standards and Privileges committee in January 2014, Loughton said that by issuing the PIN the police had &quot;exacerbated the situation out of all control&quot;. Sussex Chief Constable Martin Richards apologised to the committee, claiming he was unaware the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 gave full legal protection to all parliamentary papers and blamed conflicting legal advice. Former deputy Chief Constable of Sussex Police Robin Merrett claimed he &quot;could understand&quot; the constituent being &quot;alarmed&quot; at receiving the copy of Hansard and &quot;fully supported&quot; the police actions. In March 2014, the Standards and Privileges Committee found Sussex Police in contempt of Parliament, forcing Sussex Police to issue an apology.

In September 2013, Loughton apologised to former children&#x27;s minister Sarah Teather after he was recorded at an event saying the Department of Education as a result of Teather was a &quot;family free zone&quot; and that Teather &quot;did not believe in family&quot; as &quot;she certainly didn&#x27;t produce one of her own&quot;. The comments made by Loughton were described as &quot;disgusting&quot; by Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat minister for Women and Equalities.

At the 2015 general election, Loughton was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 49.5% and an increased majority of 14,949.

In August 2015, it was reported that Loughton was amongst a number of supporters of other political parties who had paid £3 to register to join the Labour Party in an attempt to participate in its leadership election. He subsequently said he had registered using his parliamentary email account to reveal &quot;what a complete farce the whole thing is.&quot; He said that he was open in his intent and would not have actually voted. He was subsequently removed from Labour&#x27;s registered supporters list and not granted a vote in the Labour Leadership election. The fee paid by Loughton to register to a supporter of the Labour Party was retained as a donation.

In September 2015, it was reported that Loughton had claimed the fourth highest expenses claim in the country.

Loughton supported Brexit in the 2016 European Union membership referendum. He campaigned for it through the Vote Leave organisation.

Loughton was Campaign Manager for Andrea Leadsom&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to become leader of the Conservative Party.

From 6 September 2016 – 19 October 2016, Loughton acted as Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee following the resignation of the Labour MP Keith Vaz over alleged inappropriate behaviour.

Loughton was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election, with a decreased vote share of 48.9% and a decreased majority of 5,106.

On 29 June 2017, Loughton came fifth in the ballot of private members&#x27; bills. He subsequently introduced the Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration Etc.) Bill.

After Loughton announced in October 2017 that he meditates in the bath for an hour every morning, it was reported that he had built up water bills over the previous two years of £662, which he had put on his expenses. After his initial comments on the length of time he spent in baths led to negative commentary in sections of the press, Loughton responded: &quot;MP takes bath is apparently hot news in Westminster at the moment. However, the real story was a conference I co-hosted at Westminster yesterday, which brought together 20 MPs from over 15 countries to promote mindfulness as one of the ways we can help tackle the epidemic of mental illness.&quot;

In July 2018, he participated in the first Worthing Pride parade. A year later in July 2019, Loughton voted to extend same-sex marriage and abortion to Northern Ireland.

In the House of Commons, Loughton sits on the Home Affairs Select Committee. He has previously sat on the Draft Mental Health Bill (Joint Committee) and Environmental Audit Committee.

Loughton employs his wife as a part-time office manager on a salary up to £25,000. The practice of MPs employing family members has been criticised by some sections of the media on the lines that it promotes nepotism. Although MPs who were first elected in 2017 have been banned from employing family members, the restriction is not retrospective – meaning that Loughton&#x27;s employment of his wife is lawful.

At the 2019 general election, Loughton was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 51% and an increased majority of 7,474.

On 26 March 2021, it was announced that Loughton was one of five MPs to be sanctioned by China for spreading what it called &quot;lies and disinformation&quot; about the country. He was subsequently banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau and Chinese citizens and institutions are prohibited from doing business with him.

On 1 December 2021, Loughton was appointed acting Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee for a second time following the resignation of Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who was appointed Shadow Home Secretary.

In April 2024, Loughton announced that he would not seek re-election as an MP at the 2024 general election, after 27 years in parliament. On 24 May 2024, he subsequently delivered his valedictory speech as a Member of Parliament.

==Personal life==
Loughton married Elizabeth Juliet MacLauchlan in 1992, and they have two daughters and one son.

On 16 April 2015, he was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA).

<text>Andy Love (born 21 March 1949) is a British Labour Co-operative politician who was Member of Parliament (MP) for Edmonton from 1997 to 2015.

==Early life==

Andy Love was educated at Greenock High School on Inverkip Road before attending the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, where he was awarded a BSc degree. He moved to London in 1974 and joined the Labour Party the following year. He studied for the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators qualification.

He was elected to the London Borough of Haringey Council in 1980 for two terms and chaired both the council&#x27;s finance and housing committees. He also served as a member of the North East Thames Regional Health Authority. In 1985 he became the political secretary for Co-operative Retail Services (now part of The Co-operative Group), and in 1993 he became the parliamentary officer of the Cooperative Party.

In the House of Commons, he was involved in many backbench groups and campaigns; he served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Jacqui Smith when she was the minister at the Department of Health and Department of Trade and Industry between 2001 and 2005. He was a member of the Public Accounts Committee, and the Treasury Select Committee from 2005 until he left Parliament ten years later.
