<text>HMAS &quot;Barcoo&quot; (K375/F375/A245) was a of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). One of twelve frigates constructed in Australia during World War II, &quot;Barcoo&quot; (named after the Barcoo River), was laid down by Cockatoo Docks &amp; Engineering Company, Sydney in 1942, and commissioned in early 1944.

Most of the ship&#x27;s wartime service was spent in New Guinea waters; with primary duties including patrol, convoy escort, troop transport, along with the shelling of Japanese positions. In April 1945, &quot;Barcoo&quot; was attached to the Borneo campaign. She was the command ship for a landing craft division at the Tarakan landings in May, and directly supported the North Borneo landings in June, before being assigned to general escort and fire support roles.

After World War II, &quot;Barcoo&quot; was converted into a survey ship. In 1948, the ship spent over a week aground on West Beach, South Australia after bring driven ashore by a storm. &quot;Barcoo&quot; spent the rest of her career surveying the waters of Australia and New Guinea, except for periods of deactivation from 1949 to 1951, and from 1956 to 1959. She was decommissioned for the final time in 1964, and sold for scrapping.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Barcoo&quot; was one of twelve frigates built in Australia during World War II. She and seven other vessels were constructed to the British River-class design. &quot;Barcoo&quot; was in length, with a beam of , and a draught of . The frigate displaced 1,340 tonnes at standard load and 1,923 tonnes at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two Admiralty 3-drum boilers, feeding steam to reciprocating vertical triple expansion engines, which provided to drive two propeller shafts. Maximum speed was , and maximum range was at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 140 personnel.

Main armament for the frigate consisted of two QF /45 calibre Mark XVI guns in single HA/LA Mark XX mounts. This was supplemented by two QF 40 mm Bofors in single Mark VII mounts, and six QF 20 mm Oerlikons in single Mark III mounts. The ship also carried three anti-submarine mortars (one Hedgehog and two Squids) as well as depth charge throwers.

&quot;Barcoo&quot; was laid down by the Cockatoo Docks &amp; Engineering Company, Sydney on 21 October 1942, launched on 26 August 1943 by the wife of Richard Keane, the Minister for Trade and Customs, and commissioned on 17 January 1944.

==Operational history==
===World War II===
After several weeks of working up, &quot;Barcoo&quot; was tasked to New Guinea in March 1944 for convoy escort duty. &quot;Barcoo&quot; and the corvette shelled Japanese positions on Kar Kar Island and at Banabun Harbour. From June to August, the frigate was heavily involved in convoy escort and troop transport duties. On 28 August, &quot;Barcoo&quot; rescued two United States Army Air Force pilots who had been forced to ditch their P-47 Thunderbolts at sea. During September and October, &quot;Barcoo&quot; returned to Sydney for maintenance refits. Returning to the New Guinea operations area, &quot;Barcoo&quot; operated against Japanese positions in New Guinea during November, including the shelling of Wilde Bay. Convoy escort and patrol duties continued until late January 1945, when the frigate returned to Australia.

&quot;Barcoo&quot; was deployed again to New Guinea in late March 1945, and in April was assigned to United States Navy Task Force 78.1 to support the Borneo campaign. For the Tarakan landings on 1 May, &quot;Barcoo&quot; was designated as the ship in charge of the landing craft tank division of the assault force. &quot;Barcoo&quot; was also involved in the North Borneo landings in June, then was assigned to general escort and fire support duties for the rest of the campaign. The frigate fired in anger for the last time on 3 August 1945, during a bombardment of the village of Soengaipaten in Borneo.

&quot;Barcoo&quot; received the three battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1944–45&quot;, &quot;New Guinea 1944&quot;, and &quot;Borneo 1945&quot;. The ship had sailed over from commissioning until the end of World War II on 15 August.

===Post-war===
Immediately after the war, &quot;Barcoo&quot; was tasked with repatriation of soldiers and prisoners-of-war, along with patrols of reoccupied areas. After this, the frigate was docked for an eight-month refit at Williamstown Dockyard to convert her into a survey ship. Modification work was completed in July 1946, and the ship began surveying operations in August 1946. During her remaining career, she carried the pennant numbers F375 and A245 at various times.
The ship was almost constantly deployed on survey operations in the waters of Australia and New Guinea for the next three years. In 1947, &quot;Barcoo&quot; conveyed Australian officials to Timor for visits to the governor of Portuguese (East) Timor and the Dutch colonial administrative centre in West Timor. During April 1948, &quot;Barcoo&quot; and the sloop were deployed together for surveying operations off South Australia. On 11 April 1948, &quot;Barcoo&quot; ran aground at West Beach, South Australia, having been driven ashore by a violent storm. Despite attempts to lighten the frigate by removing munitions and stores, the combined efforts of three tugboats were unable to pull &quot;Barcoo&quot; off the beach. A dredger was brought from Adelaide, which cleared a channel behind the stranded frigate. On the evening of 20 April, over a week after the initial beaching, &quot;Barcoo&quot; was able to be refloated. &quot;Warrego&quot; towed &quot;Barcoo&quot; to Port Adelaide for inspection and repairs.

&quot;Barcoo&quot; was placed in reserve in May 1949. She was recommissioned in March 1951 for use as a training vessel for anti-submarine exercises. The ship resumed survey duties of the Australian coast from July 1952 to April 1956, then returned to Sydney and was paid off on 25 September. The ship was reactivated for further survey work on 7 December 1959. By this point, the ship&#x27;s armament had been reduced to a single 40 mm Bofors gun. Other modifications around the time of her reactivation included the strengthening of the forward tripod mast, and the addition of a deckhouse on the aft deck.

==Decommissioning and fate==

&quot;Barcoo&quot; was decommissioned on 21 February 1964. The frigate had travelled during her career. The ship was sold for scrapping on 15 February 1972 to N. W. Kennedy, Ltd., Vancouver. The frigate was towed from Sydney to Hong Kong in March, then was taken to Taiwan to be broken up.

<text>HMAS &quot;Barwon&quot; (K406) was a that served the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) from 1945 to 1947. She was named for the Barwon River in Victoria and was one of eight River-class frigates built for the RAN during World War II.

==Construction==
HMAS &quot;Barwon&quot; was one of eight River-class frigates built for the RAN during World War II. She was laid down on 31 May 1943 at Cockatoo Docks &amp; Engineering Company, Sydney, launched on 3 August 1944 and commissioned on 10 December 1945.

==Operational history==
Following a period of training &quot;Barwon&quot; departed Sydney on an operational patrol on 14 February 1946. She visited Darwin before sailing to the Philippines. After a period in Filipino waters she returned to Darwin where she was used to dump ammunition at sea and inspect coastal navigation lights. She also transported members of a war crimes tribunal to Koepang in Timor. She returned to Sydney by 1 July 1946 and underwent a refit from that date until 29 August.

Once the refit was complete &quot;Barwon&quot; sailed to New Guinea where she was again used to inspect and repair coastal lights and dump ammunition. She arrived in Melbourne on 20 January 1947 and was taken out of commission. She subsequently paid off to reserve on 31 March 1947. In April that year she was fitted with two Squid anti-submarine mortars.

&quot;Barwon&quot; was not reactivated after entering reserve and was sold for scrapping in January 1962.

<text>The Regents of the University of California (also referred to as the Board of Regents to distinguish the board from the corporation it governs of the same name) is the governing board of the University of California (UC), a state university system in the U.S. state of California. The Board of Regents has 26 voting members, the majority of whom are appointed by the governor of California to serve 12-year terms.

The regents establish university policy; make decisions that determine student cost of attendance, admissions, employee compensation, and land management; and perform long-range planning for all UC campuses and locations. The regents also control the investment of UC&#x27;s endowment, and they supervise the making of contracts between UC and private companies.

The structure and composition of the Board of Regents is laid out in the Constitution of California, which establishes that the University of California is a &quot;public trust&quot; and that the regents are a &quot;corporation&quot; that has been granted the power to manage the trust on the public&#x27;s behalf. The constitution grants the regents broad institutional autonomy, giving them &quot;full powers of organization and government.&quot; According to article IX, section 9, subsection (a), &quot;the regents are &quot;subject only to such legislative control as may be necessary to insure the security of its funds and compliance with the terms of the endowments of the university&quot;.

== History ==

Section 11 of the Organic Act establishing the University of California begins with the following sentence: &quot;The general government and superintendence of the University shall vest in a Board of Regents, to be denominated the &#x27;Regents of the University of California,&#x27; who shall become incorporated under the general laws of the State of California by that corporate name and style.&quot;

The Organic Act described three groups of regents: six ex officio regents, eight appointed regents, and eight &quot;honorary&quot; regents. To expedite the formation of the university, the Organic Act authorized the governor to unilaterally select the eight appointed regents after the end of the current legislative session and allowed them to assume office immediately without the consent of the state senate. Governor Henry Huntly Haight announced his selections in May 1868. On May 23, a notice was published in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; of a meeting of the regents scheduled for May 28, but no record was made of this meeting. On June 9, 1868, the first two groups of regents gathered together in San Francisco for the first recorded meeting of the Board of Regents, where the appointed regents drew lots to determine the lengths of their initial terms, and then the board proceeded to elect the eight honorary regents. The &quot;honorary&quot; regents enjoyed the same authority and privileges as the first two groups of regents; the term &quot;honorary&quot; referred only to their method of selection.

As required by Section 11, the Board of Regents proceeded to form a corporation denominated the Regents of the University of California on June 12, 1868, and filed the certificate of incorporation on June 18, 1868 with the California Secretary of State. The corporation&#x27;s official name today is still the Regents of the University of California. Today, it is unusual for universities (or any other kind of corporation) to incorporate in the names of their boards, but it used to be a common practice among American universities. For example, Harvard University is still legally incorporated as the President and Fellows of Harvard College.

Incorporating the university under the exact same name as its board was just as confusing in the 19th century as it is today. In an 1894 wrongful death case, the plaintiffs did not understand this; they sued 16 regents individually, which forced the Supreme Court of California to analyze Section 11 and the June 18, 1868 certificate to hold that the original members of the Board of Regents had properly formed a corporation as a legal entity distinct from themselves. Therefore, the current members of that board could not be held liable in their individual capacities for the torts of the corporation.

The current Board of Regents is a &quot;policy board,&quot; as a result of reforms unanimously adopted from 1957 to 1960 at the instigation of UC President Clark Kerr. Before Kerr&#x27;s reforms, the regents operated as an &quot;administrative board&quot; (in Kerr&#x27;s words) for almost a century. The board met 12 times per year and its finance committee (with full authority to act on behalf of the board) met an additional 11 times, and the university budget was excruciatingly detailed. The result was that the board collectively supervised every aspect of university affairs—no matter how trivial or minor. One sign of the regents&#x27; unusually extreme level of micromanagement during this period was that it was seen as a major milestone when acting UC President Martin Kellogg gained the power in 1891 to independently hire janitors (as long as he reported on what he had done at the next meeting of the regents). Another example is that until 1901, replacements for lost diplomas required the approval of the regents. At Kerr&#x27;s encouragement, the Board of Regents cut down on the number of meetings, delegated powers and responsibilities to the university president and the campus chancellors, delegated more power to the Academic Senate, simplified the UC budget, and greatly reduced the amount of detail that flowed upwards to the regents.

== Composition ==

The majority of the board (18 Regents) is appointed via nomination by the governor of California and confirmation by the California State Senate to 12-year terms. One student Regent is selected by the board to represent the students for a one-year term through a hiring process that is conducted by the board. The remaining 7 Regents are ex officio members, namely the president of the University of California; the governor and lieutenant governor of California; the Speaker of the State Assembly; the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the President and Vice President of the AAUC (the coordinating body for the alumni associations of UC member institutions).

The Board also has two non-voting faculty representatives and two non-voting Staff Advisors. The incoming student Regent serves as a non-voting Regent-designate from the date of selection (usually between July and October) until beginning their formal term the following July 1.

The vast majority of the Regents appointed by the governor historically have been lawyers, politicians and businessmen. Over the past two decades, it has been common that UC Regents appointees have donated relatively large sums of money either directly to the governor&#x27;s election campaigns or indirectly to party election groups.

==Operations==

Administrative support is provided to the Regents by the Office of the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Regents of the University of California, which shares an office building with the UC Office of the President in Oakland.

Since President Kerr&#x27;s reforms, the Board has traditionally held its meetings six times per year and alternated its meeting sites between the northern campuses (usually UCSF Mission Bay, and before then, Berkeley) and the southern campuses (usually UCLA). Thus, for decades, the Board&#x27;s meetings have utilized temporary seating arrangements rather than a boardroom permanently configured for its exclusive use (which is true of the Board of Trustees of the California State University).

==Significant corruption scandals==

The Board of Regents has been the subject of various corruption scandals throughout the university&#x27;s long history.

The board&#x27;s first scandal surfaced in 1874. By June 1872, regent Samuel Merritt had become the chair of the board&#x27;s building committee and initiated planning for the original College of Letters building (later known as North Hall). Although the board also passed a resolution that same month prohibiting self-dealing with respect to construction of campus buildings, the winning bid was ultimately submitted by Merritt&#x27;s preferred contractor, Power and Ough, &quot;and much of the lumber and cement for the building came from Merritt&#x27;s own lumber company.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Evening Post&quot; broke the story on January 6, 1874, and two days later, the California State Assembly&#x27;s public building committee launched an investigation which held hearings through March 3 of that year. The committee concluded that Merritt had profited financially from providing an inferior building to the university at an exorbitant cost: $24,000 over its reasonable value. Merritt resigned from the board in June 1874 and in October refunded $867 of his lumber company&#x27;s profits to the university.

In 1965, free-speech movement activist Marvin Garson responded to a call by the California Federation of Teachers to &quot;investigate the composition and operation of the Board of Regents.&quot; He produced a 19-page report documenting prior cases of corruption, concluding that, &quot;taken as a group, the Regents are representatives of only one thing—corporate wealth.&quot;

In 1970, the California state auditor found that regent Edwin W. Pauley, who owned Pauley Petroleum, personally profited when university officials steered $10.7 million dollars into one of his company&#x27;s business deals.

In 1970, the California state auditor investigated regent William French Smith and regent Edward Carter for conflict of interest dealings. The actions investigated included the joint purchase of a $253,750 piece of property for Carter&#x27;s personal use, with the university paying $178,750 and Carter paying the remaining $75,000. Smith, who was Governor Reagan&#x27;s personal lawyer and a Reagan appointee to the board, was a lawyer at the law firm representing the Irvine Company, a private real estate company. Carter was a lifetime board member of the Irvine Foundation, which has a controlling interest in the Irvine Company.

In 2007, the Board of Regents signed the EBI contract, a $50 million university privatization contract funded by the BP oil company. The contract gave financial control over all clean energy research at UC Berkeley to BP, with $15 million directed towards proprietary research allowing the oil company able to keep around a third of the patents produced by the academic employees while also financially controlling all other clean energy research upon the campus. The contract likewise allowed BP oil to construct a building on the UC Berkeley campus with entire floors that only BP employees are allowed to enter. Before the signing of the contract, a number of environmental organizations, including Greenpeace penned a letter to the regents, which was read during the regents meeting on November 2, 2007, which stated &quot;The prospect of giant carbon polluters directing research related to and gaining control of key energy technologies is very troubling – especially when the research is conducted at, and the technologies are developed in collaboration with, public institutions.&quot; Following the signing of the contract by the UC Regents, professors complained that BP Oil bypassed normal university hiring and tenure protocol and hired professors directly, without consulting any academic department. Opponents have also argued this and other privatization contracts are a way to replace middle class engineering jobs with cheap graduate student labor.

Regent Richard C. Blum, financier and husband to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, served on the board of regents&#x27; Investment Committee. Allegations of conflicts of interest have arisen because, during Blum&#x27;s tenure, UC has invested hundreds of millions of dollars where he had concurrent business interests.

According to an investigation by the Sacramento News &amp; Review, conflict-of-interest dealings by the UC Board of Regents accelerated in the years prior to the 2008 recession. Beginning in 2003, &quot;[M]embers of the board of regents benefited from the placement of hundreds of millions of university dollars into investments, private deals and publicly held enterprises with significant ties to their own personal business activities, while simultaneously increasing the cost of university attendance.&quot; Additionally, the investigation found that some members of the regents’ investment committee, individuals who are also &quot;Wall Street heavy hitters,&quot; modified long-standing UC investment policies, specifically, steering away from investing in more traditional instruments (such as blue-chip stocks and bonds) toward largely unregulated and risky &quot;alternative&quot; investments, such as private equity and private real-estate deals. These changes in UC investment policy brought personal gain to individual members of the board of regents Investment committee, while also reducing the funds within the UC endowment that might have otherwise been used to cover costs related to the operations of the university.

In May 2017, &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that the Regents had been hosting costly dinner parties using university funds. Only after extensive public outcry, university leadership released a statement saying the university would no longer fund these dinners.

<text>HMAS &quot;Bataan&quot; (D9/I91/D191) was a destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Laid down in 1942 and commissioned in 1945, the destroyer was originally to be named &quot;Chingilli&quot; or &quot;Kurnai&quot; but was renamed prior to launch in honour of the US stand during the Battle of Bataan.

Although not completed in time to see combat service during World War II, &quot;Bataan&quot; was present in Tokyo Bay for the official Japanese surrender, and made four deployments to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. In 1950, while en route for a fifth Occupation Force deployment, the Korean War started, and the destroyer was diverted to serve as a patrol ship and carrier escort until early 1951. A second Korean tour was made during 1952. &quot;Bataan&quot; was paid off in 1954, and sold for scrap in 1958.

==Description==

&quot;Bataan&quot; was one of three destroyers ordered for the RAN. These ships were designed with a displacement of 2,116 tons, had a length of overall and between perpendiculars, and a beam of . Propulsion was provided by three drum-type boilers supplying Parsons Impulse Reaction turbines; these provided to the ship&#x27;s two propeller shafts. Maximum speed was , with an economical speed of . The ship&#x27;s company consisted on 261 personnel: 14 officers and 247 sailors.

On completion, the destroyer&#x27;s primary armament consisted of six 4.7-inch Mark VII guns in three twin turrets. She was also armed with two 4-inch Mark XVI* guns in a twin turret, six 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns, a quad-barrelled 2-pounder Mark VIII pom pom, a quadruple torpedo tube set for four 21-inch torpedoes, two depth charge throwers, and 46 depth charges. In 1945, the number of torpedoes and depth charges carried was reduced.

==Construction and career==
The destroyer was laid down by Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company Limited at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney in New South Wales on 18 February 1942. She was launched on 15 January 1944 by Jean MacArthur, the wife of General Douglas MacArthur. The ship was commissioned into the RAN on 25 May 1945, with construction work completing on 26 June. The destroyer was originally to be named &quot;Chingilli&quot;, but this was changed to &quot;Kurnai&quot; (after the Kurnai or Gunai Aborigines) before construction started. The name was changed yet again prior to the ship&#x27;s launch to &quot;Bataan&quot;; honouring ties between Australia and the United States by recognising the stand by US troops during the Battle of Bataan, and reciprocating the US decision to name a cruiser in honour of the Australian cruiser , lost at the Battle of Savo Island.

On entering service, &quot;Bataan&quot; sailed to Japan via the Philippines; although arriving too late to participate in combat, she was present in Tokyo for the official Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945. &quot;Bataan&quot; remained in Japanese waters until 18 November, serving as representative of the Australian military and helping coordinate the repatriation of prisoners-of-war. Between late 1946 and late 1949, the destroyer spent 17 months over four tours of duty in Japanese waters with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The rest of these three years was spent operating in Australian waters.
In late June 1950, &quot;Bataan&quot; was en route to Japan for a fifth tour when the Korean War started. From early July 1950 until 29 May 1951, the destroyer operated off Korea; patrolling and blockading, escorting aircraft carriers, and bombarding shore targets. A second Korean tour occurred between 4 February and 31 August 1952, with &quot;Bataan&quot; fulfilling most of the same duties as before. &quot;Bataan&quot; was presented with the battle honour &quot;Korea 1950–52&quot; for her service. In November 1953, &quot;Bataan&quot; visited Singapore. This was the only time since the Korean War, and the only time for the rest of her career, that the destroyer would leave Australian waters.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Bataan&quot; paid off at Sydney on 18 October 1954, and was laid up in reserve awaiting conversion to an anti-submarine escort. The conversion was cancelled in 1957, with &quot;Bataan&quot; placed on the disposal list, then sold for scrap to T. Carr and Company of Sydney in 1958.

<doc id="429227" wikidata="Q1093714" url="?curid=429227" title="Josephus Daniels">
<text>Josephus Daniels (May 18, 1862 – January 15, 1948) was an American diplomat and newspaper editor from the 1880s until his death, who managed &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; in Raleigh, at the time North Carolina&#x27;s largest circulation newspaper, for decades. A Democrat, he was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to serve as Secretary of the Navy during World War I. He became a close friend and supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy. After Roosevelt was elected President of the United States, he appointed Daniels as his U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, serving from 1933 to 1941. Daniels was a vehement white supremacist and segregationist. Along with Charles Brantley Aycock and Furnifold McLendel Simmons, he was a leading perpetrator of the Wilmington insurrection of 1898.

As Secretary of the Navy, Daniels handled policy and formalities in World War I while his top aide, Roosevelt, handled the major wartime decisions. After the Mexican Revolution, as ambassador to Mexico, Daniels dealt with the anti-American government and its expropriation of American oil investments. In North Carolina in the early 20th century, he had been a leading progressive, supporting public schools and public works, and calling for more regulation of trusts and railroads. He supported prohibition and women&#x27;s suffrage, and used his newspapers to support the regular Democratic Party ticket.

Daniels believed that &quot;the greatest folly and crime&quot; in U.S. history was giving &quot;Negroes&quot; the vote. He and his newspaper &quot;championed the white supremacy cause in frequent news reports, vigorously worded editorials, provocative letters, and vicious front page cartoons that called attention to what the newspaper called the horrors of &#x27;negro rule.&#x27;&quot; Daniels argued that as long as African Americans had any political power, they would block progressive reforms.

He was highly influential in the state legislature&#x27;s passage in 1900 of a suffrage amendment that effectively disenfranchised most blacks in the state, excluding them from the political system for decades until the late 20th century. They were also excluded from juries and subject to legal racial segregation.

==Early life and career==
Josephus Daniels was born in 1862 to a shipbuilder and his wife in Washington, North Carolina, located on the Pamlico River in Beaufort County. The state had seceded from the Union in 1861. Before the boy was 3, his father was killed by a Confederate sharpshooter, because of his well-known Union sympathies. The father was attempting to leave with Federal forces evacuating Washington, N.C. during the Civil War. Young Daniels moved with his widowed mother and two siblings to Wilson, North Carolina. He was educated at Wilson Collegiate Institute and at Trinity College (now Duke University).

Daniels edited and eventually purchased a local newspaper, the &quot;Wilson Advance&quot;. Within a few years, he became part owner, along with his brother Charles, of the &quot;Kinston Free Press&quot; and the &quot;Rocky Mount Reporter&quot;. He studied law at the University of North Carolina (today the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and was admitted to the bar in 1885, but did not practice law.

After becoming increasingly involved in the North Carolina Democratic Party and taking over the weekly paper &quot;Daily State Chronicle&quot;, Daniels served as North Carolina&#x27;s state printer from 1887 to 1893. He was appointed as chief clerk of the U.S. Department of the Interior under Grover Cleveland in 1893–95.

===Marriage and family===

In 1888, Daniels married Addie Worth Bagley. She was the granddaughter of former Governor Jonathan Worth. They had four sons: Josephus, Worth Bagley, Jonathan Worth, and Frank A. Daniels II. Jonathan followed his father into public service, serving as a special assistant and, briefly, White House Press Secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940s.

==&quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot;==
In 1894, with the financial assistance of industrialist Julian S. Carr, also a white supremacist, Daniels acquired a controlling interest in Raleigh&#x27;s &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot;, and left his federal position. Under his leadership, the paper was a strong advocate for the Democratic Party, which at the time was struggling to maintain its power in the state against a fusion of the Republicans and Populists.

According to Daniels in his autobiography, &quot;The &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot; was relied upon to carry the Democratic message and to be the militant voice of White Supremacy, and it did not fail in what was expected.&quot; Daniels printed numerous articles intended to stoke fears of black men as rapists of white women. A lone white woman noticing a black man in her vicinity would be written up in the paper as a narrowly avoided rape. Daniels also argued that achieving political office emboldened black men to commit more outrages against white women. He hired cartoonist Norman E. Jennett to spread his message among the 25% of white voters who were illiterate. Daniels admitted later that actual assaults committed by black men on white women were very few in number. However his newspaper coverage had the desired effect of winning Populists over to the Democratic Party. Newspapers were sold at cost to the Democratic Party, which distributed them to white voters. According to historian Helen Edmonds, the paper &quot;led in a campaign of prejudice, bitterness, vilification, misrepresentation, and exaggeration to influence the emotions of the whites against the Negro.&quot; The result was the only successful &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in American history, the overthrow of an elected government by force in the Wilmington insurrection of 1898. In the findings of the Wilmington Race Riot Commission, Daniels is the only name mentioned as a cause of the insurrection.

The white supremacy campaign led to Democratic victories in 1898 and 1900. Having regained control of the state legislature, the Democrats passed a suffrage amendment raising barriers to voter registration, which affected most African Americans in the state. The political exclusion was maintained into the late 1960s. Later in life, while discussing his success, &quot;Daniels admitted that the paper was occasionally excessive in its bias toward Democrats and that stories were not fully researched before publication and probably could not be &#x27;sustained in a court of justice.&#x27;&quot; He supported a number of progressive causes, such as public education and anti-child-labor laws. As Secretary of the Navy, he banned the consumption of alcohol aboard U.S. naval vessels.

Daniels never apologized for using the newspaper to encourage white supremacist violence in 1898. In his memoir, he spoke positively about the actions of Red Shirts and how his white supremacy campaign had crushed &quot;Negro domination&quot;. &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; remained under the control of Daniels&#x27;s family until 1995, when it was sold to The McClatchy Company. In 2006 the newspaper published an editorial apologizing for its role in the Wilmington insurrection of 1898 and consequent massacre.

==Secretary of the Navy==
Daniels supported native Southerner Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential election. After Wilson&#x27;s victory, he was appointed as Secretary of the Navy.
Secretary Daniels held the post from 1913 to 1921, throughout the Wilson administration, overseeing the Navy during World War I. Franklin D. Roosevelt, a future US president, served as his Assistant Secretary of the Navy.

Daniels believed in government ownership of armor-plate factories, and of telephones and telegraphs. At the end of the First World War, he made a serious attempt to have the Navy permanently control all radio transmitters in the United States. If he had succeeded amateur radio would have ended, and it is likely that radio broadcasting would have been substantially delayed.

Teetotaler Daniels banned alcohol from United States Navy ships in General Order 99 of June 1, 1914. (After the end of Prohibition in 1933, ship commanders determined that alcohol continue to be banned on board ship but that limited access to beer be maintained for sailors with 45 days or more of service on their records. Limited access to harder alcoholic beverages by officers to be distributed at their discretion was subsequently maintained for use on shore during official leave from onboard duty.)

In 1917, Secretary Daniels determined that no prostitution would be permitted within a five-mile radius of naval installations. In New Orleans, this World War I directive resulted in the shutting down of brothels in Storyville. It had long-lasting consequences for servicemen and others during subsequent decades.

On March 15, 1919, Daniels issued General Order No. 456, prohibiting all forms of work on the Christian Sabbath (Sunday). He ordered,

In order to insure a proper observance of the Lord&#x27;s Day in the Navy of the United States, and to provide the officers and men with rest and recreation so essential to efficiency, the following order will be carry out: Hereafter all commanding officers and others officially concerned will see to it that aboard ships and on shore stations to which they are attached, no work of any character whatsoever is performed except works of necessity. This order will be construed and embracing target practice, and drills of every character, inspection of ship and crew, clothing inspection, issuing of small stores, and all other ship activities that violate the letter and spirit of this order. No vessel of the Navy shall begin cruise on Sunday except in case of emergency ...

During World War I, Daniels created the Naval Consulting Board to encourage inventions that would be helpful to the Navy. Daniels asked Thomas Edison to chair the board, as the Secretary was worried that the US was unprepared for the new conditions of warfare and needed new technology. Additionally, Daniels was the first Secretary of the Navy to sponsor naval aviation. He established the first naval air station at the Pensacola Navy Yard, claiming &quot;aircraft must form a large part of our naval force for offensive and defensive operations&quot;.

The Newport Sex Scandal erupted due to a Navy sting operation, overseen by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, that was conducted in 1919. Begun as an attempt to clean up what was seen as &quot;immoral conditions&quot; at Naval Station Newport, it expanded to investigations of the civilian population in Newport. It resulted in the arrests for homosexual activity of some 17 sailors and a prominent Episcopal Navy chaplain, with imprisonment imposed for some. When the tactics used in the sting operation became known, it attracted national news coverage. Congress undertook an investigation, resulting in both Secretary Daniels and Roosevelt being rebuked by a Congressional committee. The report called FDR&#x27;s behavior &quot;reprehensible,&quot; and said that the actions &quot;violated the code of the American citizen and ignored the rights of every American boy who enlisted in the Navy to fight for his country.&quot;

Daniels published &quot;The Navy and the Nation&quot; (1919), which was primarily a collection of war addresses he had made as Secretary of the Navy.

==Later life==
After leaving government service in 1921, Daniels resumed the editorship of &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot;. He strongly supported Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt for president in 1932.

===Ambassador to Mexico===
President Roosevelt appointed Daniels as United States Ambassador to Mexico, a post he held from 1933 to 1941. Roosevelt expected Daniels to help carry out his &quot;Good Neighbor Policy&quot; in Latin America. It was an unordinary choice as, along with his white supremacy, during Daniels&#x27; time as head of the Navy he had overseen an invasion of the port of Veracruz attempting to sabotage Victoriano Huerta. This invasion was seen as Yankee imperial intervention. Daniels&#x27;s arrival in Mexico City was marred by a violent demonstration when a group of Mexicans stoned the U.S. Embassy in protest of his appointment.

Roosevelt appointed Daniels in order to heal the rift caused by the U.S. invasion of Mexico during its civil war. Daniels&#x27;s speeches and policies while serving as Ambassador to Mexico are believed to have improved U.S.-Mexican relations. He praised a proposed Mexican plan for universal popular education and, in a speech to U.S. consular officials, advised them to refrain from interfering too much in the affairs of other nations. Daniels also saw the reforms of President Lázaro Cárdenas as analogous to Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. He particularly supported Cardenas&#x27;s expropriation of large landowners, over the objections of the State Department. Historian Tore Olsson has argued that Daniels&#x27;s support of Cardena&#x27;s agrarian reform &quot;contributed most significantly to the success&quot; of the program and that Daniels wielded &quot;astounding power over the future of agrarian reform.&quot; This support also translated into support for the Farm Security Administration back home. Daniels, along with John A. Ferrell, was also instrumental in obtaining support for the Rockefeller Foundation&#x27;s Mexican Agriculture Program, which influenced the later Green Revolution.

====Anti-Catholicism====
American Catholics bitterly attacked Daniels for failing to oppose the virulent attacks on the Catholic Church by the Mexican government during and after its revolution. Daniels was a staunch Methodist, and worked with Catholics in the U.S., but had little sympathy for the Church in Mexico. He believed that it represented the landed aristocracy, which stood opposed to his version of liberalism. In Mexico, the main issue was the government&#x27;s efforts to shut down Catholic schools; Daniels publicly approved these attacks and praised anti-Catholic Mexican politicians. In a July 1934 speech at the U.S. Embassy, Daniels praised the anti-Catholic efforts that had been led by former president Plutarco Elías Calles:

General Calles sees, as Jefferson saw, that no people can be both free and ignorant. Therefore, he and President Rodriguez, President-elect Cardenas and all forward-looking leaders are placing public education as the paramount duty of the country. They all recognize that General Calles issued a challenge that goes to the very root of the settlement of all problems of tomorrow when he said: &#x27;We must enter and take possession of the mind of childhood, the mind of youth.&#x27;

However Daniels also warned Mexicans that they should not be so harsh against the Church.

==Return to North Carolina==
In 1941, his son, Jonathan, was named a special assistant to Roosevelt. At that time, Daniels resigned his ambassadorial post in Mexico to return to North Carolina. There he resumed the editor&#x27;s post at &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot;, and continued his outspoken editorial style.

Daniels published several recollections of his years in public office. In addition to &quot;The Navy and the Nation,&quot; he wrote &quot;Our Navy at War&quot; (1922), &quot;The Life of Woodrow Wilson&quot; (1924), and &quot;The Wilson Era&quot; (1944).

Daniels and his son Jonathan were passengers on Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s 1945 funeral train from Raleigh until Roosevelt&#x27;s burial at his home of Springwood in Hyde Park, New York. The father and son rode the train back to Washington, D.C. in the company of widow Eleanor Roosevelt and the new president, Harry S. Truman.

During the course of his life, Daniels operated several newspapers, culminating with the &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot;, which is still in operation. He served in public office with a strong belief in improving conditions for labor and the working class. The story of Daniels&#x27; life closely mirrors that of North Carolina during the same time period. From the catastrophe of Civil War to national prominence, Daniels was a prime example of the strengths and weaknesses that marked the progress of his state. In 1941, he retired to Raleigh due to his wife&#x27;s poor health; she died in 1943.

After completing a five-volume autobiography, in which he expressed regret over his vicious attacks (but not the overall righteousness) of the white-supremacy campaign of the late 19th century, Daniels died in Raleigh on January 15, 1948, at the age of eighty-five. He is buried in Historic Oakwood Cemetery of that city. Daniels divided his shares of the &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot; among all his children and Jonathan became editor. The family retained control until it sold the paper in 1995.

Josephus Daniels had a cousin, younger by 11 years, John T. Daniels, the Coast Guard member assigned to the Kill Devil Life-Saving Station in 1903, who took the famous photo of the Wright brothers in humanity&#x27;s first ever successful piloted airplane flight, with Orville at the controls of the Wright Flyer.

==Legacy and honors==
*According to historian John Milton Cooper:

*In 1956, the new Daniels Middle School in Raleigh was named after him. On June 16, 2020, the Wake County Board of Education voted unanimously to rescind the naming of the school and to rename it Oberlin Middle School. Daniels Hall on North Carolina State University&#x27;s main campus was also named after him. On June 22, 2020, the NC State Board of Trustees voted to rename Daniels Hall. Chancellor Randy Woodson said &quot;Josephus Daniels had strong ties to white supremacy and played a leading role in the Wilmington insurrection of 1898. The building’s name had served as a constant reminder of a shameful part of our state’s history.&quot; Until future renovations are completed, the building has been temporarily denoted &quot;Beat Navy Hall&quot; in recognition of the strong partnerships with the US Army and the academic departments within the building. Students and faculty alike simply refer to the building by its street address, 111 Lampe, or simply Lampe for the street it is located on.
*His home, Wakestone, is now a National Historic Landmark. It was used as a Masonic Temple before its demolition in August 2021.

A statue of Daniels formerly stood in Nash Square in Raleigh. It was removed on June 16, 2020, after the murder of George Floyd and subsequent widespread civil unrest. Members of the Daniels family approved of the removal.

==In fiction==
In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s &quot;Southern Victory&quot; series of alternate history novels, Daniels was US Secretary of the Navy during the timeline&#x27;s analog of World War I, and the US Navy named a destroyer escort after him during the series&#x27;s version of World War II.

<doc id="429230" wikidata="Q1340975" url="?curid=429230" title="The River (Bruce Springsteen album)">
<text>The River is the fifth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen, released as a double album on October 17, 1980, by Columbia Records. The album was Springsteen&#x27;s attempt at making a record that captured the E Street Band&#x27;s live sound. Co-produced by Springsteen, his manager Jon Landau, and bandmate Steven Van Zandt, the recording sessions lasted 18 months in New York City from March 1979 to August 1980. Springsteen originally planned to release a single LP, &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;, in late 1979, before deciding it did not fit his vision and scrapped it. Over 50 songs were recorded; outtakes saw release as B-sides and later on compilation albums.

Musically, &quot;The River&quot; is a heartland rock and rock and roll record with a live garage-band sound, combining party songs with introspective ballads. The lyrics expand on the themes of Springsteen&#x27;s previous albums &quot;Born to Run&quot; (1975) and &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; (1978) and mainly focus on love, marriage, and family. Springsteen took inspiration from the writer Flannery O&#x27;Connor for the characterizations. The cover photograph of Springsteen was taken by Frank Stefanko, who also took the front cover photograph of &quot;Darkness&quot;.

&quot;The River&quot; became Springsteen&#x27;s first album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart in the U.S. and was his fastest-selling album yet. It was also a commercial success elsewhere, topping the chart in Canada and Norway, and reaching number two in the U.K. It spawned several singles, including &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;, a U.S. top ten, &quot;Fade Away&quot;, and &quot;The River&quot;. Springsteen and the E Street Band supported the album on The River Tour from October 1980 to September 1981.

&quot;The River&quot; received varying critical responses on release. Positive reviews praised the songwriting, performances of the E Street Band, and lyrical evolution, while negative reviews believed Springsteen was recycling old material and lacking in creativity. In later decades, &quot;The River&quot; has been regarded as one of Springsteen&#x27;s finest works, although many critics remain divided on the album&#x27;s consistency. It has appeared on several best-of lists, while several songs foreshadowed the direction Springsteen took on his next album, the solo effort &quot;Nebraska&quot; (1982). &quot;The River&quot; was reissued as an expanded box set in 2015, featuring the scrapped single LP and a documentary detailing the album&#x27;s making.

==Background==
Bruce Springsteen supported his fourth studio album &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; on the Darkness Tour from May 1978 to January 1979, performing with the E Street Band – Roy Bittan (piano), Clarence Clemons (saxophone), Danny Federici (organ), Garry Tallent (bass), Steven Van Zandt (guitar), and Max Weinberg (drums). Upon the tour&#x27;s completion, he began preparations for his next studio record. Having grown closer with the E Street Band during the tour, he wanted his fifth album to be a &quot;band&quot; album, one that captured the feel of the band playing on stage. Springsteen stated: &quot;I wanted to cut some music that felt very explosive. I wanted a record that combined the fun aspect of what the band did along with the story I was telling. Find a way to combine those things and create a bigger picture of what we did out in front of the people.&quot; 

Rehearsals took place with the E Street Band during the early months of 1979 at a studio inside Springsteen&#x27;s home in Holmdel, New Jersey. Springsteen wrote both new material and had an assortment of pre-written tracks either already recorded in the studio during the &quot;Darkness&quot; sessions or performed live on the tour, including &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Point Blank&quot;, &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;, &quot;Ramrod&quot;, &quot;Drive All Night&quot;, and &quot;Sherry Darling&quot;. Springsteen used the Byrds as the basis for several songs, specifically their use of harmony vocals to unite the band as a whole. According to the author Peter Ames Carlin, the new material picked up where &quot;Darkness&quot; left off, being influenced by early rock and roll and country records, with stories capturing &quot;snapshots of the real world as viewed through the hopes, labors, fears, joys, and strugglers of the unheralded many&quot;. Songs that took shape during this time included &quot;Be True&quot;, &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be with You&quot;, &quot;Bring on the Night&quot;, and &quot;Roulette&quot;, which was written as a response to the Three Mile Island accident and foreshadowed Springsteen&#x27;s future as a politicized singer-songwriter.

==Recording history==
===Initial sessions===

Recording sessions for the album began in March 1979 and took place at the Power Station in New York City. The venue was chosen after Weinberg, Tallent, and Bittan had recorded Ian Hunter&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Never Alone with a Schizophrenic&quot; album there. Several different microphones were set up around the studio&#x27;s large gymnasium-sized room designed to capture the live sounds of the band. Springsteen, Jon Landau, and Van Zandt acted as co-producers. Van Zandt exerted more control during these sessions after assisting with production during the &quot;Darkness&quot; sessions. He was tasked with giving the band a more &quot;garage&quot; and &quot;rugged&quot; sound to contrast with &quot;Born to Run&quot; (1975) and &quot;Darkness&quot;, and ensured the band was ready to play; Landau ensured progress was being made. Van Zandt later said: &quot;&quot;The River&quot; was the first record where I felt comfortable enough to start capturing what the band was all about.&quot; 

Springsteen&#x27;s perfectionism from previous recording sessions remained, with the entire band recording numerous retakes of the same tracks. The Power Station&#x27;s resident engineer Bob Clearmountain was taken aback by Springsteen&#x27;s work ethic at first but was impressed by his material and dedication to achieving perfection. Songs were played based on the complexity of their chord structures. Springsteen taught the band the more complex ones in sections, while more simple ones began without the band knowing what they were playing entirely. Tallent remembered: &quot;We&#x27;d hear the song for the first time while we were recording it.&quot; Tracks were mostly recorded live, apart from occasional vocal, guitar, or saxophone overdubs. 

One of the first songs recorded was &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;. In May, the band attempted &quot;Bring on the Night&quot; and the &quot;Born to Run&quot; outtake &quot;Janey Needs a Shooter&quot;, the latter of which Springsteen donated to Warren Zevon. Between May and mid-June, the band recorded &quot;Sherry Darling&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be With You&quot;, &quot;Ramrod&quot;, &quot;Bring on the Night&quot;, &quot;Jackson Cage&quot;, &quot;Be True&quot;, and &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;, which Springsteen initially wrote for the Ramones, believing its poppy sound was out of place with the rest of the material, but Landau convinced him to keep it. Harmony vocals on the song were provided by Flo &amp; Eddie (Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, formerly of the Turtles). Anticipating a hit single, the mixer Chuck Plotkin sped the tape up to &quot;give the vocal a more boyish lilt&quot;, after which Clearmountain mixed the song. Springsteen initially disliked the finished song before being convinced it fit on the album and would perform well as the lead single. In June, Springsteen attended the wedding of his lighting director Marc Brickman in Los Angeles, California, after which he wrote &quot;Stolen Car&quot; and other songs with marital and parental themes, including &quot;The Price You Pay&quot;, &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Marry You&quot;, and &quot;Cindy&quot;. Other songs, such as &quot;You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)&quot; and &quot;Ricky Wants a Man of Her Own&quot;, appeared by late July.

The sessions continued through August, during which Springsteen wrote &quot;The River&quot;. By September, he had finalized a track list and was ready to release the album, to be titled &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;, by Christmas 1979. This version was engineered and mixed by Clearmountain. Nevertheless, Springsteen felt the album &quot;wasn&#x27;t enough&quot; as he kept listening to it. In his 2016 autobiography &quot;Born to Run&quot;, he explained that he was inspired by artists such as Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, and Marvin Gaye, who &quot;created self-aware, self-contained worlds on their albums, and then invited their fans to discover them&quot;. After performing with the E Street Band at the No Nukes benefit concerts for Musicians United for Safe Energy at Madison Square Garden in mid-September, Springsteen reconceptualized the album. He had debuted &quot;The River&quot; during the shows and wanted to write new material that reflected the song&#x27;s darker themes.

===Later sessions===

With &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot; scrapped, the recording sessions continued through the end of 1979 into 1980 as Springsteen kept writing new material, including &quot;Crush on You&quot;, &quot;Where All the Bands Are&quot;, &quot;Party Lights&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Rocker&quot;, &quot;Living on the Edge of the World&quot;, &quot;Take &#x27;em as They Come&quot;, &quot;Out in the Street&quot;, and &quot;Two Hearts&quot;. Discussing his long recording periods in the studio, Springsteen said: &quot;I stopped feeling bad about ... spending a long time in the studio ... I said [to myself], That&#x27;s me, that&#x27;s what I do. I work slow, and I work slow for a reason: To get the results that I want.&quot; These sessions were engineered by Neil Dorfsman as Clearmountain departed for other commitments. 

Between January and April 1980, Springsteen continued writing new songs, such as &quot;Restless Nights&quot; and &quot;Wreck on the Highway&quot;, and reintroduced already recorded material to re-record, including &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Point Blank&quot;, &quot;Sherry Darling&quot;, &quot;Drive All Night&quot;, &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, and &quot;Jackson Cage&quot;. Landau proposed making the record a double album to encompass everything Springsteen was trying to achieve. By the end of April, Springsteen had selected 22 tracks for the album, although recording continued. He later stated in the late 1990s: &quot;It&#x27;s never over until it&#x27;s over. Everybody&#x27;s telling you you&#x27;re done and you take it home and it&#x27;s just not right ... [But] my life at the time [of &quot;The River&quot;] was extremely focused, probably to the detriment of the records.&quot; 

The sessions lasted until August 1980 for a total of 18 months, during which almost 50 songs were recorded. Of the outtakes, some were issued as B-sides (&quot;Be True&quot;, &quot;Held Up Without a Gun&quot;, and &quot;Roulette&quot;), while others later appeared on compilation albums such as 1998&#x27;s &quot;Tracks&quot; (&quot;Loose Ends&quot; and &quot;Ricky Wants a Man for Her Own&quot;) and 2015&#x27;s &quot;The Ties That Bind: The River Collection&quot; (&quot;Cindy&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Got Away&quot;). Springsteen also gave songs to other artists, including &quot;From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come)&quot; to Dave Edmunds, who released his own version in 1982, as well as &quot;Dedication&quot; and &quot;Your Love&quot; to the singer Gary U.S. Bonds. Springsteen later admitted he left &quot;an entire album ... [of] three [to] four-minute pop songs&quot; in the vault.

===Mixing===
Mixing for the double album, now called &quot;The River&quot;, was done at Clover Studios in Los Angeles by Plotkin and Toby Scott. Reportedly lasting five months, mixing the 20 chosen recordings proved problematic; the studio&#x27;s microphones used to record the live sound bled together, creating a &quot;muddled and unclear&quot; sound. Scott explained: &quot;Neil [Dorfsman]&#x27;s recording of the room mics had been one of my problems when I mixed &quot;The River&quot;. There was so much cymbal in those room mics, I had to recreate the room by using the Clover studio and piping some of the drums back out over speakers into the studio to have them reverberate around, while also using reverb units.&quot; Plotkin and Scott attempted to make their own mix of &quot;Hungry Heart&quot; before deciding Clearmountain&#x27;s mix was superior. Mastering was done by Ken Perry at Capitol Studios in Hollywood.

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;The River&quot; is a double album that contains 20 tracks. Its musical style has been characterized as heartland rock, rock and roll, R&amp;B, folk, and country, with vocal hints at British punk rock and new wave. Kenneth Partridge of &quot;Billboard&quot; retrospectively described &quot;The River&quot; as Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;new wave album, but it&#x27;s also his pop album&quot;. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming, the music was &quot;leaner&quot; and &quot;more strongly rooted in rock &amp; roll&quot; than &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Darkness&quot;. Due to the nature in which the album was recorded, &quot;The River&quot; features a &quot;garage band&quot; and &quot;live&quot; sound throughout, which Springsteen said represented an effort &quot;to provide fuel for our live show and to create a counterbalance to the ballads that began showing up more and more in my work&quot;. Carlin said the live performances give the songs a &quot;barroom feel that trade the precision of &#x27;Born to Run&#x27; and &#x27;Darkness on the Edge of Town&#x27; with the power of the full band&#x27;s instrumental wallop&quot;.
Expanding on the themes of its two predecessors, &quot;The River&quot; lyrics focus primarily on love, marriage, and family. Springsteen himself said the record &quot;was my first attempt to write about the commitments of home and marriage.&quot; He was particularly influenced by the writer Flannery O&#x27;Connor for his characterizations, stating: &quot;There was something in those stories of hers that I felt captured a certain part of the American character that I was interested in writing about.&quot; Paul Pearson of &quot;Treble&quot; stated that Springsteen stripped the storytelling of the album&#x27;s two predecessors for in-depth character studies: &quot;The characters on &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Darkness&quot; were ones everyone recognized. The characters on &quot;The River&quot; were ones we &quot;knew&quot;.&quot; The writers Larry David Smith and Jon Rutter split &quot;The River&quot; songs into three storytelling styles: &quot;frivolous&quot; party songs (&quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot;, &quot;Ramrod&quot;), songs detailing relationships (&quot;The Ties that Bind&quot;, &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Marry You&quot;), and &quot;a systematic extension of &quot;Darkness&quot; themes via a series of life-is-hell songs&quot; (&quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;The River&quot;, &quot;The Price You Pay&quot;). The album also deals with car themes extensively, particularly on sides three and four; on &quot;Sherry Darling&quot; and &quot;Crush on You&quot;, the car represents &quot;tedious responsibility&quot; and &quot;the arrival of lust&quot;, respectively. In his 2004 book &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, Dave Marsh summarized:

===Side one===
The album opener, &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;, is an up-tempo track featuring saxophone. In it, the narrator addresses his heartbroken girlfriend who wants to live without thinking about other people. He challenges her not to forsake love but accept the ties of relationships. &quot;Sherry Darling&quot; is a &quot;frat-rock&quot; song with a live feel, featuring cheers and background singing. Based on 1960s songs like the Swingin&#x27; Medallions&#x27; &quot;Double Shot of My Baby&#x27;s Love&quot; (1966), the lyrics are about a man who wants to be alone with his girlfriend in his car, but is stuck driving his rowdy mother-in-law to an unemployment agency. &quot;Jackson Cage&quot; is a rock and new wave song featuring organ. It is about a woman living a secluded life, which prevents her from achieving the American dream. Springsteen said of the song: &quot;I never knew anybody who was unhappy with their job and was happy with their life. It&#x27;s your sense of purpose. Now, some people can find it elsewhere. Some people can work a job and find it some place else.&quot;

&quot;Two Hearts&quot; is a garage rock song about searching for a lover and someone to help &quot;whip this world&quot; into a place worth living. &quot;Independence Day&quot; is a slow, introspective ballad featuring piano, acoustic guitar, and saxophone. A drama about a relationship between a father and son, the son has realized he and his father, despite their similarities, will never agree on anything, leaving him to declare his &quot;independence&quot; from his father and leave home. The song was inspired by Springsteen&#x27;s relationship with his own father.

===Side two===

Based on a piano riff from the Four Seasons&#x27; &quot;Dawn (Go Away)&quot; (1964), &quot;Hungry Heart&quot; is a pop song about a man who leaves his family. He reminisces about his relationship history, and by the song&#x27;s end, he realizes he needs to return to a home life. Springsteen&#x27;s vocals were sped up to sound more &quot;boyish&quot;, while the duo Flo &amp; Eddie provided harmony vocals. &quot;Out in the Street&quot; is a new wave and rock song led by piano. Lyrically, it uses street parties as a getaway from the depressing, hard working life, with emphasis on asserting youthfulness. &quot;Crush on You&quot; is a Rolling Stones-esque dance song featuring slide guitar from Van Zandt. In the lyrics, the narrator sees the girl of his dreams and imagines what she is like, from her possible occupation as a waitress or a bank teller, to an heir to the Rockefeller family.

&quot;You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)&quot; is a neo-rockabilly song compared by the authors Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon to the styles of Eddie Cochran and Duane Eddy. The song&#x27;s subject is frustrated with commerce and his inability to express his sexual desires. Following a series of upbeat rock songs, &quot;I Wanna Marry You&quot; is a slower 1960s style pop ballad about romance. In it, a couple question their relationship responsibilities; the narrator promises to do the best for his girl. Margotin and Guesdon write that the song represents a return to the main theme throughout &quot;The River&quot;, that &quot;only life as a couple allows you to overcome the misfortunes and failures of life&quot;. 

The album&#x27;s title track asks the album&#x27;s central question: &quot;Is a dream a lie if it [does not] come true, or is it something worse?&quot; Inspired by the lives of Springsteen&#x27;s own sister and brother-in-law, &quot;The River&quot; possesses themes of nostalgia and sadness, telling the story of a young man who has settled into life by his late teens, marrying his pregnant girlfriend, Mary, and getting a union construction job. The couple are bound to follow the same working class lives as their parents, as well as their grandparents. The song also describes the couple&#x27;s unromantic courthouse wedding, the narrator losing his job due to the &quot;economy&quot;, and the two&#x27;s memories of swimming in a local watering hole referred to as &quot;the river&quot;. The title has also been interpreted as a metaphor for the narrator&#x27;s passions, which by the song&#x27;s end has &quot;gone dry&quot;. Musically inspired by &quot;My Bucket&#x27;s Got a Hole in It&quot; (1949) by Hank Williams, &quot;The River&quot; is a mid-tempo folk and Americana ballad featuring harmonica.

===Side three===

&quot;Point Blank&quot; is a downbeat, dark ballad with a melancholic atmosphere. It concerns a narrator telling the story of how the woman he loves is about to die, further describing past moments in their lives. &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot; is a 1950s Chuck Berry-style rock song about the titular ranch located in Amarillo, Texas, with lyrically references to Junior Johnson, James Dean, and Burt Reynolds. &quot;I&#x27;m a Rocker&quot; is a humorous, playful, rockabilly-style rock song offering &quot;an effective sideswipe at commercialism gone wrong&quot;, featuring cultural references to Batman, James Bond, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and more. Margotin and Guesdon write that tracks such as &quot;I&#x27;m a Rocker&quot; encapsulated the energy of the live songs, while others like &quot;Point Blank&quot; echoed the &quot;austerity&quot; of &quot;Darkness&quot;.

&quot;Fade Away&quot; is a pop-soul &quot;retro ballad&quot; wherein the narrator expresses his sadness after his ex-girlfriend falls in love with another man. The man&#x27;s memories of her consumes him, as he does not want to disappear from her life. &quot;Stolen Car&quot; is a ballad with a &quot;dense, dreamlike atmosphere&quot; that describes a man being haunted by memories of an ended romance. Heartbroken, he turns to crime as he drives a stolen car through the night, causing the darkness as he has lost his love. Springsteen said of the track: &quot;That song&#x27;s character, drifting through the night, is the first to face the angels and devils that will drive him toward his love and keep him from ever reaching her.&quot;

===Side four===
&quot;Ramrod&quot; is a rock and roll song that Partridge retrospectively compared to Springsteen&#x27;s 1984 B-side &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;. The song&#x27;s subject expresses passion for his car, a 1932 Ford with a Hemi engine and four gears. Carlin wrote that &quot;the narrator has death on his mind, even as he pushes his automotive slang into the red zone of sexual metaphor.&quot; According to Margotin and Guesdon, the narrator is Springsteen himself reminiscing about his adolescence in New Jersey. &quot;The Price You Pay&quot; is a pop and rock ballad with musical and lyrics references to &quot;The Promised Land&quot; from &quot;Darkness&quot;. It is one of several tracks on the album that concern the human toll of economic and social inequality and contains a second-person proverb about facing the costs of life and love. In the song, the narrator recounts to a young woman on a beach the story of &quot;the promised land&quot;, wherein the characters &quot;crossed the desert sands&quot; only to be turned away and &quot;to face the price you pay&quot;.
&quot;Drive All Night&quot; is a slower song driven by &quot;dark romanticism&quot;, featuring piano, organ, and saxophone. The song concerns a narrator who has lost his true love. He describes the pain he feels as he drives through the night, eventually urging his lost love to return to him, despite their relational problems, and fully embrace each other. &quot;Wreck on the Highway&quot; is a country-style ballad that took inspiration from the 1930s Roy Acuff country song of the same name. Taking place on a rainy night, the song concerns a man witnessing a car accident on the highway during his drive home from work. As an ambulance arrives to take the injured driver away, the narrator&#x27;s emotions consume him as he thinks about the victim&#x27;s significant other and her pain when she learns of the accident. Partridge said the song unifies the entire album by containing bouts of humor mixed with moments of sadness, representing &quot;the randomness of the world&quot;. Springsteen said &quot;Wreck on the Highway&quot;, as the album&#x27;s final track, symbolized the closing of the highway: &quot;It&#x27;s a recognition of mortality.&quot;

==Packaging and artwork==
The cover art of &quot;The River&quot; is a black-and-white close-up photograph of Springsteen taken by Frank Stefanko, who previously took the cover photograph for &quot;Darkness&quot;. According to Stefanko, the image was an outtake from the &quot;Darkness&quot; photo sessions, chosen by Springsteen while mixing &quot;The River&quot;. Springsteen wanted &quot;The River&quot; cover photo to be &quot;sober and serious&quot;. In it, he appears unshaven, dons a plaid shirt, and is looking into the camera. The authors Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon argue that the image signifies that &quot;The River&quot; is a record &quot;from the American heartland of the countryside and small towns&quot; and &quot;an album recorded by blue-collar musicians&quot;. Springsteen&#x27;s name and the album title are colored blue against a black background. The cover was designed by Jimmy Wachtel.

The album&#x27;s back cover features various images, including five brides and a groom, a stack of paper cups, a bald eagle, and an American flag. On the album&#x27;s original release, Robert Palmer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; argued that the back cover contributes to the album&#x27;s &quot;thematic thrust&quot;. The inside of the sleeve features photographs of Springsteen and the E Street Band and the lyrics of the 20 songs.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;The River&quot; was released through Columbia Records on October 17, 1980. The album was a commercial success, becoming Springsteen&#x27;s first album to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. It also became his fastest-selling album yet, selling 1.6 million copies in the U.S. by Christmas 1980. The album was also a success elsewhere, topping the charts in Canada and Norway, and reached number two in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K., three in France, five in Spain, and eight in Australia. It also reached number 28 in Japan, 31 in Germany, and 36 in Switzerland. &quot;The River&quot; has since been certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the U.S., making it one of Springsteen&#x27;s best-selling albums, and his highest certified studio release after &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; (1984) and &quot;Born to Run&quot;.
&quot;Hungry Heart&quot; was released four days after the album on October 21, 1980, as the first single from &quot;The River&quot;, with &quot;Held Up Without a Gun&quot; as the B-side. It became Springsteen&#x27;s first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top ten hit single, reaching number five, eventually selling five million copies. In the U.K., it reached number 44. &quot;Fade Away&quot; appeared as the second single in North America, Australia, and New Zealand on January 22, 1981, with &quot;Be True&quot; as the B-side. It reached number 20 in the U.S. &quot;Sherry Darling&quot;, backed by &quot;Be True&quot;, appeared in February, followed by &quot;The River&quot;, backed by &quot;Independence Day&quot;, in April in Europe and Australia only. It hit number 35 in the U.K. &quot;The River&quot; was also nominated for Best Rock Vocal Performance at the 24th Annual Grammy Awards in 1982. &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot;, backed by &quot;Wreck on the Highway&quot;, appeared as the next single in August 1981 in the U.K. only. Additional singles released in 1981 included &quot;I Wanna Marry You&quot;, backed by &quot;Be True&quot;, in Japan only, and &quot;Point Blank&quot;, backed by &quot;Ramrod&quot;, in the U.K. only.

Springsteen and the E Street Band supported &quot;The River&quot; on The River Tour, which ran 140 shows. The North American leg ran from October 3, 1980 to March 5, 1981. The band performed songs across Springsteen&#x27;s career, as well as outtakes and numerous one-off covers, although Springsteen typically focused on &quot;The River&quot; material. When asked by interviewers about the focus on new material, Springsteen said he wanted to play the new songs live and &quot;[had] very little to do anymore with my first two, even three LPs&quot;. The shows themselves featured upwards of thirty songs and lasted over three hours in length. During a filmed show in Tempe, Arizona in early November, Springsteen, who had remained politically conscious up to that point, made a rare political statement about the election of Ronald Reagan that occurred the day before. He later said his first trip to Europe led him to &quot;step out of the United States and look back with a critical eye&quot;. Soon after, Springsteen began performing covers of songs that added social commentary to the shows, such as Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; (1945) and Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot; (1970). A European tour ran from April to May 1981, followed by a final American leg from June to September, which opened with six sold-out shows at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The River&quot; was greeted with the widest range of critical reviews of Springsteen&#x27;s career up to that point. Amongst positive reviews, the album was hailed as his best work to date, one of the year&#x27;s best records, and a &quot;rock &amp; roll milestone&quot;, offering &quot;a full, panoramic screen of rock at its most glorious and passionate&quot;. It was described as a summary and extension of Springsteen&#x27;s records up to that point, creating an album that encapsulates what Springsteen is about. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Steve Pond said &quot;The River&quot; has as strong a &quot;cumulative impact&quot; as &quot;Born to Run&quot;, and commended the record for successfully capturing the &quot;gut-level punch and immediacy&quot; of Springsteen&#x27;s live performances.

Several critics highlighted the expanded lyrical themes from previous albums. Stephen Holden referred to &quot;The River&quot; as &quot;Springsteen&#x27;s dictionary, encyclopedia, and bible of rock and roll&quot;, arguing that its &quot;lighter moments&quot; give it the edge over Springsteen&#x27;s earlier albums. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Paul Nelson said the record possesses &quot;weighty conclusions, words to live by&quot; regarding &quot;the second acts of American lives&quot;, conclusions &quot;filled with an uncommon common sense and intelligence that could only have come from an exceptionally warmhearted but wary graduate of the street of hard knocks&quot;. In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Paolo Hewitt compared listening to &quot;The River&quot; to &quot;taking a trip through the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll heartland as you&#x27;ve never experienced it&quot;. Springsteen&#x27;s vocal performances and the musical performances of the E Street Band were also praised; &quot;High Fidelity&quot; Sam Sutherland said the album &quot;captur[es] both the skeletal power and impressionistic delicacy [the E Street] members have mastered in their years together&quot;. 

More negatively, some believed Springsteen was recycling old material and had lost his &quot;creative edge&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Robert Palmer said the album could have used trimming due to most of the tracks having similar tones and details throughout, on top of featuring similar themes and styles as &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Darkness&quot;. Writing for &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, Ira Robbins ridiculed the album for having repetitive lyrical themes, a &quot;party atmosphere&quot;, poor vocals and &quot;flawed&quot; lyrics, equating to a &quot;water-treading exercise&quot; record that &quot;neither upholds his standards of excellence nor explores any new avenues&quot;. In a very negative review for &quot;NME&quot;, Julie Burchill said &quot;The River&quot; is &quot;great music for people who&#x27;ve wasted their youth to sit around drinking beer and [are] wasting the rest of their lives too&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The River&quot; the year&#x27;s best album, Springsteen the best artist and singer, and &quot;Hungry Heart&quot; the best single. It was also voted the second-best album of 1980 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll, behind the Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot;. In an accompanying essay, the poll&#x27;s supervisor Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;All the standard objections apply—his beat is still clunky, his singing overwrought...but his writing is at a peak, and he&#x27;s grown into a bitter empathy. These are the wages of young romantic love among those who get paid by the hour.&quot; Despite &quot;NME&quot; negative review, the publication ranked &quot;The River&quot; the 12th best album of the year in their end-of-year list.

==Legacy==
In the context of Springsteen&#x27;s career, &quot;The River&quot; was a stepping stone between &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; and &quot;Nebraska&quot;, a minimalist, folk-inspired solo effort released in September 1982. Springsteen recorded the songs as demo recordings at his newly-rented home in Colts Neck, New Jersey between December 1981 and January 1982, intending to re-record them with the E Street Band, but after poor test sessions he decided to release the recordings as is. The album chronicled dark hardships felt by everyday blue-collar workers, as well as bleak tales of criminals, law enforcement officers, and gang wars. Several songs on &quot;The River&quot; foreshadowed the direction Springsteen took for &quot;Nebraska&quot;, including &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, &quot;The River&quot;, and &quot;Wreck On the Highway&quot;. &quot;The River&quot; also influenced the writing of Springsteen&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;.

According to Margotin and Guesdon, &quot;The River&quot;, as a trilogy with &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;, elevated Springsteen as a seminal chronicler of 1970s America, as Bob Dylan had done in the 1960s with &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; (1965), &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; (1965), and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; (1966). The authors call &quot;The River&quot; an essential Springsteen record and one that is as revered as other double albums such as &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;The Beatles&quot; (1968), the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972), and Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; (1976). In 1987, &quot;The New York Times&quot; Jon Pareles cited &quot;The River&quot; as the beginning of 1980s heartland rock.

===Retrospective reviews===
In later decades, commentators consider &quot;The River&quot; one of Springsteen&#x27;s finest works. Critics have praised the album&#x27;s track sequencing, Springsteen&#x27;s songwriting, and growing maturity. Mark Guarino of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that although the album examines themes Springsteen had touched on before and since its release, &quot;The River&quot; is unique in that &quot;it takes its time to explore the highs and lows of growing pains, as adolescence wrestles its way into adulthood&quot;. &quot;Grantland&quot; Steven Hyden said that, despite being overshadowed by the records that surround it in Springsteen&#x27;s discography, &quot;The River&quot; is &quot;the most representative of his entire body of work&quot;. Critics have also praised the performances of the E Street Band, and the contributions of Van Zandt. Several agreed the album successfully captured the band&#x27;s force as a live act.

Most critics remain divided on &quot;The River&quot; consistency, with several agreeing that it feels like two separate albums. Writing for AllMusic, Mark Deming found the first half stronger than the second, which contains songs that work well as standalone tracks rather than a cohesive whole. &quot;Billboard&quot; Kenneth Partridge argued that the album would have been &quot;more consistent&quot; as a single LP, but as it stands, &quot;The River&quot; is &quot;a summation of everywhere [Springsteen] had been and an indication he wasn&#x27;t content to spin his wheels&quot;.&quot;&quot; Other critics described the album as &quot;sprawling&quot; and noted the presence of filler songs, although Dave Lifton of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; argued the record&#x27;s length &quot;works to its advantage&quot; as the combination of &quot;fluff&quot; and &quot;more thoughtful&quot; material &quot;helps define Springsteen&#x27;s ultimate philosophy: The world can be cold and unfair, but that doesn’t mean you can&#x27;t let loose and dance through it.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine also felt the &quot;throwaways&quot; gave the LP &quot;cinematic scope&quot;, while Gillian G. Gaar stated the &quot;mixture of joy and pain&quot; gave &quot;The River&quot; &quot;its richness and depth&quot;.

===Rankings===
&quot;The River&quot; has appeared on best-of lists. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number 250 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, then was re-ranked at number 253 in the 2012 revised list. The following year, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 484 in a similar list. In 2020 lists compiling the best albums of 1980, &quot;Paste&quot; placed it at number two, behind Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Remain in Light&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; put it at number eight. &quot;Paste&quot; also ranked &quot;The River&quot; the 29th best album of the 1980s in 2012. The album also appeared in a list of the 100 best rock albums of the 1980s by &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; in 2015.

==Reissues==

&quot;The River&quot; was first released on CD in 1988. This was followed by additional CD reissues by Sony BMG in 2003 and 2008. On December 4, 2015, &quot;The River&quot; was reissued as an expanded box set in celebration of the album&#x27;s 35th anniversary. Titled &quot;The Ties That Bind: The River Collection&quot;, the set includes four CDs, three DVDs, and a coffee table book. The first two CDs feature a newly remastered version of &quot;The River&quot; and the third contains the previously unreleased &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot; single LP. The fourth CD collects 22 outtakes from &quot;The River&quot; sessions, including 12 previously-unreleased ones and ones that had appeared on &quot;Tracks&quot; in 1998 and the bonus disc of &quot;The Essential Bruce Springsteen&quot; in 2003. Some previously released songs, including &quot;Stolen Car&quot; and &quot;You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)&quot;, appeared in different versions. The DVDs feature a documentary on the album&#x27;s making, as well as a concert film of Springsteen and the E Street Band performing in Arizona during The River Tour in 1980. &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot; was critically acclaimed. 

To celebrate the release of &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot; and &quot;The River&quot; 35th anniversary, Springsteen and the E Street Band embarked on The River Tour from January 2016 to February 2017, performing in North America, Europe, and Oceania. Many of the shows featured &quot;The River&quot; performed in its entirety, and other songs from Springsteen&#x27;s career.

<doc id="429233" wikidata="Q368008" url="?curid=429233" title="HMAS Adelaide (1918)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Adelaide&quot; was a light cruiser of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), named after Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. Laid down in 1915, wartime shortages and design modifications meant the ship was not completed until 1922, earning her the nickname &quot;HMAS &quot;Longdelayed&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Adelaide&quot; served with the Royal Navy&#x27;s Special Service Squadron during 1924 and 1925, and was involved in the 1927 Malaita massacre. She was decommissioned in 1928, but was modernised and returned to service just before World War II began. During the war, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was involved in successful efforts to secure the colony of New Caledonia for Free France, was present during the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour, and intercepted the German blockade runner &quot;Ramses&quot;.

The cruiser was decommissioned in 1946, and broken up for scrap in 1949.

==Design and construction==
The design of &quot;Adelaide&quot; was modified from the &quot;Chatham&quot; subclass of the light cruisers, with similarities to the &quot;Birmingham&quot; subclass. The ship was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of , and a draught of . The initial ship&#x27;s company stood at 33 officers and 450 sailors, but by 1941, this had dropped to 26 officers and 436 sailors.

The propulsion system consisted of Parsons turbines providing to two propeller shafts. As designed, the ship had a maximum speed of , but modifications during her career saw this increase to during the 1920s, then drop to by 1941. The cruiser was originally fuelled by both coal and oil, but the ship&#x27;s refit in 1938–39 saw her converted to oil only, along with the removal of the foremost funnel and boilers.

&quot;Adelaide&quot; was laid down at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney on 20 November 1915. She was launched on 27 July 1918 by Lady Helen Munro Ferguson, the wife of the Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson. Construction was not completed until 31 July 1922 because of wartime shortages, loss of machinery part forgings for items that could not be made in Australia to enemy action, and modifications based on wartime experience: the ship was consequently nicknamed &quot;HMAS &quot;Longdelayed&quot;. She was finally commissioned into the RAN on 5 August 1922. &quot;Adelaide&quot; cost 1,271,782 pounds to build.
The ship&#x27;s badge was based on the municipal seal of the City of Adelaide. Her motto was &quot;Ut Prosint Omnibus Conjuncti&quot;&quot;, Latin for &quot;United for the Common Weal&quot;. Some incorrect versions of the ship&#x27;s badge show the motto as &quot;United We Stand&quot;, the motto for .

===Armament===
At launch, the cruiser&#x27;s armament consisted of nine BL 6-inch Mk XII naval guns, a single QF 3-inch anti-aircraft gun, a single Ordnance QF 12-pounder 8 cwt field gun, four QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss saluting guns, ten .303-inch machine guns (a mix of Lewis and Maxim guns), two submerged broadside 21-inch torpedo tubes, and two depth charge chutes. The number of machine guns was increased to twelve in 1924.

During a refit in 1938 and 1939, &quot;Adelaide&quot;″s armament was altered. One 6-inch gun, the field gun, the anti-aircraft gun, and the torpedo tubes were all removed. They were replaced with three 4-inch anti-aircraft guns. Fire-control equipment was also upgraded at this time. During May and June 1942, the anti-aircraft armament was supplemented by six 20 mm Oerlikon guns. Another refit lasting from June to September 1943 saw a second 6-inch gun removed, the 4-inch armament reduced to two guns, and four hydraulic depth charge throwers installed.

==Operational history==

===1922–1939===
After a brief sea-trials and working up period off Jervis Bay, &quot;Adelaide&quot; spent the period from commissioning until February 1924 operating on standard duties and exercises throughout the Australia Station. On 18 April 1924, following a brief refit, she joined the Royal Navy&#x27;s Special Service Squadron for a flag-showing cruise outside Australian waters. During the voyage, &quot;Adelaide&quot; visited New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii, the western coasts of Canada and the United States, the Panama Canal (becoming the first RAN ship to travel through), the Caribbean, and eastern Canada, before reaching Portsmouth on 28 September. The cruiser left for home on 10 January 1925, sailing via the Mediterranean, Ceylon, Singapore, and Thursday Island, and reached Sydney on 7 April.

In October 1927, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was called to the Solomon Islands in response to the killing of a district officer, a cadet, and fifteen native police by Kwaio natives at Malaita. Arriving at Tulagi on 14 October, an officer and sixteen sailors were sent ashore to reinforce local law enforcement. The ship then proceeded to Malaita to protect the landing of three platoons of troops on 17 October, then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the killers, in what became the Malaita massacre. &quot;Adelaide&quot; returned to Australia on 23 November. Over the next year, &quot;Adelaide&quot; continued a pattern of exercises and promotional visits to Australian ports.

The cruiser was paid off into reserve on 27 June 1928. During 1938 and 1939, the ship underwent a 60,000 pound modernisation, which included the conversion from both coal and oil as fuel to oil-only (requiring the removal of two boilers and an exhaust funnel), and alterations to the cruiser&#x27;s armament. The cruiser was recommissioned on 13 March 1939, and undertook exercises with the Australian and New Zealand Squadrons. The ship returned to Sydney in late April, and was paid off again on 17 May, so that the ship&#x27;s company could be sent to England aboard to commission the new light cruiser . With the threat of war in Europe imminent, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was prepared for a return to service, and was commissioned on 1 September.

===World War II===
The ship was initially used for convoy escort and protection duties in Australian waters.

In September 1940, &quot;Adelaide&quot; carried the French official Henri Sautot from the New Hebrides (later Vanuatu) to Nouméa, New Caledonia. Sautot had been appointed governor by Free French leader Charles de Gaulle, following attempts by Vichy France to gain control of the French colony. On 3 September, while en route, &quot;Adelaide&quot; collided with the merchant vessel SS &quot;Coptic&quot;. (Although both ships only suffered minor damage, the Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line sued the Australian government in 1947 for £35,000 in damages.) After Sautot landed, on 25 September, &quot;Adelaide&quot; patrolled off the coast, to counter a perceived threat from the Vichy sloop &quot;Dumont d&#x27;Urville&quot;. The Australian cruiser remained in the area until the situation had stabilised, returning to Sydney on 8 October. &quot;Adelaide&quot; resumed escort and patrol duties around Australia and New Guinea waters.

During May to July 1942, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was docked at Garden Island for a refit, focused primarily on increasing the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft weapon outfit. Consequently, the ship was one of several major Allied vessels in Sydney Harbour during the Japanese midget submarine attack of 31 May 1942. After the refit, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was assigned to Fremantle for convoy escort work in the Indian Ocean.
In November 1942, &quot;Adelaide&quot;, along with the Dutch cruiser and the Australian corvettes and , escorted a convoy across the southern Indian Ocean. On 28 November, the ships spotted an unidentified vessel, which claimed to be the Norwegian merchantman &quot;Taiyang&quot;. Officers aboard &quot;Adelaide&quot; recognised the ship as the German blockade runner &quot;Ramses&quot;, but did not receive a response to their challenging until two boats were lowered from the ship, followed by the sound of an explosion from a scuttling charge. &quot;Adelaide&quot; opened fire, hitting with the third salvo onwards, and continued shooting until &quot;Ramses&quot; sank eight minutes later, then recovered the Germans from the boats.

&quot;Adelaide&quot; continued to operate from Fremantle until October 1944, apart from a refit at Williamstown Naval Dockyard from June to September 1943, where further armament alterations were made. On 8 October 1944, the cruiser made for Sydney. On 26 February 1945, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was decommissioned, but then recommissioned on 19 May to serve as a tender to the naval base . &quot;Adelaide&quot; was awarded the battle honours &quot;Pacific 1941–43&quot; and &quot;East Indies 1942&quot; for her wartime service.

==Decommissioning and fate==

&quot;Adelaide&quot; was decommissioned for the final time on 13 May 1946. The ship was stripped of equipment during 1947, and on 24 January 1949, the hulk was sold to Australian Iron and Steel for breaking up. &quot;Adelaide&quot; was towed by the tug to Port Kembla during 1 and 2 April, where she was scrapped. The deck timber was used to build the ferry Radar for Charles Rosman.

As a memorial to the ship the main-mast was erected alongside the Sphynx Memorial in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Sydney, in about 1950. An information plaque with a diagram of the ship was installed nearby. One of the cruiser&#x27;s 6-inch guns was found at a rubbish tip in Victoria; this was restored, then placed on display at HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot;, Victoria. The ship&#x27;s bell came first to the Amazon Hotel in Exeter, England, removed to the Spice Lounge restaurant in Exmouth. 

In 2014, a shield removed from HMAS &quot;Adelaide&quot; during a refit in 1943 and dumped on a tip on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, was transported to Perth for refurbishment. A member of the Royal Australian Artillery Historical Society of Western Australia, which had been searching for such a shield for 20 years as a match for a 6-inch Mk XI naval gun it held from HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot;, a ship scrapped in 1928, had spotted the shield at location. The naval gun and shield were installed at the Leighton Battery in September 2015 to replicate the original 6-inch guns at site.

<text>Ross Harold Arnett Jr. (April 13, 1919 – July 16, 1999) was an American entomologist noted for his studies of beetles, and as founder of the &quot;Coleopterist&#x27;s Bulletin&quot;.

Born in Medina, New York, he was a star student at Cornell University, where he became interested in beetles and started on a revision of the Nearctic Silphidae. He graduated in 1942, the same year that he married his high school sweetheart Mary Ennis.

His first job was at the New York State Conservation Department, studying the stomach contents of game birds, but in July 1942 he joined the US Army (as a private) and was sent to Lowry Air Force Base to study the Sperry bombsight. After this diversion into non-insect work, he went to Avon Park Air Force Range in Florida to survey the mosquito population and control it, and from there to the Army School of Malariology in Panama to teach mosquito taxonomy.

In October 1945 he was discharged and returned to Cornell for graduate study, where he studied under Robert Matheson and Walter Muenscher, receiving a master&#x27;s degree in 1946 and the doctorate in 1948, where he returned to beetle work, revising the Oedemeridae. He started the &quot;Coleopterist&#x27;s Bulletin&quot; in 1947, while still a grad student.

In July 1948, the newly minted Dr. Arnett moved to Arlington, Virginia and went to work for the USDA as a beetle taxonomist. He returned to academia in 1954 however, as head of the biology department of Saint John Fisher College in Rochester, New York, then to The Catholic University of America in 1958, where he published his best-known work &quot;Beetles of the United States&quot; (1963). In 1966 Arnett moved to Purdue University, later spending three years as Henry L. Beadel Fellow at the Tall Timbers Research Station near Tallahassee, Florida, and then in 1973 moving to Siena College in Loudonville, New York.

In 1979 he resigned his position to write full-time, publishing several books, then in 1982 founding Flora and Fauna Publications in Gainesville, Florida. The company was bought by E.J. Brill Publishers, but in 1989 they stopped doing biology, and he formed Sandhill Crane Press to continue with his work. He also founded the Center for Systematic Entomology during this time.

He died at his home in Gainesville, while working on a new handbook &quot;American Beetles&quot;, which was published posthumously.

<text>HMAS &quot;Burdekin&quot; (K376) was a that served the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) from 1944 to 1946. She was named for the Burdekin River in Queensland and was one of twelve River-class frigates built for the RAN during World War II.

==Construction==
&quot;Burdekin&quot; was launched at Walkers Limited, Maryborough on 30 June 1943 and commissioned on 27 June 1944. Her patron was K. Collings, daughter of Senator Joe Collings, Minister for the Interior and Leader of the Government in the Senate.

==Operational history==
===World War II===
&quot;Burdekin&quot; was posted to New Guinean waters in October 1944. From November 1944 to May 1945, she escorted convoys travelling between New Guinea and the Philippines. In May 1945, she supported the Australian landing at Tarakan and carried out surveillance operations in the Borneo and Celebes areas.

The frigate was awarded the battle honours &quot;Pacific 1944–45&quot; and &quot;Bornero 1945&quot; for her wartime service.

===Post-war===
After a refit in Sydney, &quot;Burdekin&quot; operated in the Netherlands East Indies following the end of the war. The Japanese surrender of Dutch Borneo was accepted on board the ship by Major General Milford of the 7th Australian Division, on 8 September 1945 and the ship later participated in occupation duties off Borneo and Macassar.

==Decommissioning and fate==
HMAS &quot;Burdekin&quot; returned to Australia in January 1946 and was paid off from the RAN and placed in reserve on 18 April 1946.

She was declared for disposal on 9 November 1960 and sold for scrap to the Tolo Mining and Smelting Company of Hong Kong on 21 September 1961.

<text>HMAS &quot;Darwin&quot; (FFG 04), named for the capital city of the Northern Territory, was an &quot;Adelaide&quot;-class guided-missile frigate, formerly in service with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). One of four ships ordered from the United States, &quot;Darwin&quot; entered service in 1984. During her career, she has operated in the Persian Gulf, as part of the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce, and off the Solomon Islands. The frigate underwent a major upgrade during 2007 and 2008. She was decommissioned on 9 December 2017 and was supposed to be scuttled as a dive wreck in Tasmania, but the deal was pulled by the Tasmanian Government and her fate remains uncertain.

==Design and construction==

Following the cancellation of the Australian light destroyer project in 1973, the British Type 42 destroyer and the American &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigate were identified as alternatives to replace the cancelled light destroyers and the &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers. Although the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class was still at the design stage, the difficulty of fitting the Type 42 with the SM-1 missile, and the success of the &quot;Perth&quot;-class acquisition (a derivative of the American &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class destroyer) compared to equivalent British designs led the Australian government to approve the purchase of two US-built &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates in 1976. A third was ordered in 1977, followed by a fourth (&quot;Darwin&quot;), with all four ships integrated into the USN&#x27;s shipbuilding program. A further two ships were ordered in 1980, and were constructed in Australia.

As designed, the ship had a full load displacement of 4,100 tons, a length overall of , a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion machinery consists of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, which provide a combined to the single propeller shaft. Top speed is , with a range of at . Two electric auxiliary propulsors are used for close manoeuvring, with a top speed of . Standard ship&#x27;s company is 184, including 15 officers, but excluding the flight crew for the embarked helicopters.
Original armament for the ship consisted of a Mark 13 missile launcher configured to fire RIM-66 Standard and RGM-84 Harpoon missiles, supplemented by an OTO Melara gun and a Vulcan Phalanx point-defence system. As part of the mid-2000s FFG Upgrade Project, an eight-cell Mark 41 Vertical Launch System was fitted, with a payload of RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles. For anti-submarine warfare, two Mark 32 torpedo tube sets are fitted; originally firing the Mark 44 torpedo, the &quot;Adelaide&quot;s later carried the Mark 46, then the MU90 Impact following the FFG Upgrade. Up to six machine guns can be carried for close-in defence, and since 2005, two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts have been installed when needed for Persian Gulf deployments. The sensor suite includes an AN/SPS-49 air search radar, AN/SPS-55 surface search and navigation radar, SPG-60 fire control radar connected to a Mark 92 fire control system, and an AN/SQS-56 hull-mounted sonar. Two helicopters can be embarked: either two S-70B Seahawk or one Seahawk and one AS350B Squirrel.

The ship was laid down by Todd Pacific Shipyards at Seattle, Washington on 3 July 1981, to the &quot;Perry&quot; class Flight III design. The &quot;Adelaide&quot;s were built as part of the United States Navy&#x27;s construction program, so were assigned USN hull numbers; &quot;Darwin&quot; was FFG-44. She was launched on 26 March 1982 and commissioned into the RAN on 21 July 1984.

==Operational history==
During her career, &quot;Darwin&quot; has been deployed to the Persian Gulf on five occasions: during 1990, 1991, 1992, 2002, and 2004.

&quot;Darwin&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 19 September to 3 November 1999.

From 14 to 18 February 2001 &quot;Darwin&quot; was berthed in the Mumbai harbour in column RE for the International Fleet Review.

The ship was deployed to the Solomon Islands in 2001.

&quot;Darwin&quot; underwent a major upgrade and refit at Garden Island during 2007 and 2008, returning to service prior to November 2008.

On the morning of 13 March 2009, &quot;Darwin&quot; was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The frigate did not participate in the fleet entry, but was anchored in the harbour for the review.

Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, &quot;Darwin&quot; was granted three battle honours in 2010: &quot;East Timor 1999&quot;, &quot;Persian Gulf 2003-03&quot;, and &quot;Iraq 2003&quot;.

In October 2013, &quot;Darwin&quot; participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney.

April 2014 saw &quot;Darwin&quot;, as part of Combined Task Force 150, intercept 1,032 kg of heroin on a dhow off the east coast of Africa, followed in July by a further 6,248 kg of hashish on a dhow in the Indian Ocean.

As of 7 January 2016, &quot;Darwin&quot; has sailed over 1 million nautical miles.

In February 2016, &quot;Darwin&quot; was one among the 100 ships participating in the International Fleet Review 2016 in Vishakhapattanam.

In March 2016, &quot;Darwin&quot; intercepted a small, stateless fishing vessel about 170 nautical miles off the coast of Oman. On board they found more than 2,000 pieces of weaponry, including 1,989 AK-47 assault rifles and 100 rocket propelled grenades. According to a U.S. assessment, the weapons were initially sent from Iran and were likely intended for Houthi rebels in Yemen.

In May 2016, &quot;Darwin&quot; made three seizures of heroin worth $800 million of the coast of Africa.

The Royal New Zealand Navy invited the Royal Australian Navy to send a vessel to participate in their 75th Birthday Celebrations over the weekend of 19–21 November 2016; however, following the Kaikōura earthquake on New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, &quot;Darwin&quot; was sent to aide in humanitarian and disaster relief operations.

&quot;Darwin&quot; was decommissioned in a ceremony held at Garden Island, Sydney on 9 December 2017. She and the other &quot;Adelaide&quot;s are to be replaced by the s.

==Fate==
In August 2018, Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne announced that &quot;Darwin&quot; would be scuttled as a reef in Skeleton Bay, near St Helens, Tasmania. The ship was expected to be scuttled sometime in 2019, but the Tasmanian Government later rejected the proposal citing costs. In response, a new campaign emerged attempting to preserve her as a museum ship. On 21 August 2019, several oil drums under &quot;Darwin&quot; caught fire at Henderson.

<text>In United States politics, a swing state (also known as battleground state, toss-up state, or purple state) is any state that could reasonably be won by either the Democratic or Republican candidate in a statewide election, most often referring to presidential elections, by a swing in votes. These states are usually targeted by both major-party campaigns, especially in competitive elections. Meanwhile, the states that regularly lean to a single party are known as &quot;safe states&quot; (or more specifically as &quot;red states&quot; and &quot;blue states&quot; depending on the partisan leaning), as it is generally assumed that one candidate has a base of support from which a sufficient share of the electorate can be drawn without significant investment or effort by the campaign.

Due to the winner-take-all method that most states use to determine their presidential electors, candidates often campaign only in competitive states, which is why a select group of states frequently receives a majority of the advertisements and candidate visits. The battlegrounds may change in certain election cycles and may be reflected in overall polling, demographics, and the ideological appeal of the nominees.

== Background ==

In United States presidential elections, each state is free to decide the method by which its electors to the Electoral College will be chosen. To increase its voting power in the Electoral College system, every state, with the exceptions of Maine and Nebraska, has adopted a winner-take-all system, where the candidate who wins the most popular votes in a state wins all of that state&#x27;s electoral votes. 

The expectation was that the candidates would look after the interests of the states with the most electoral votes. However, in practice, most voters tend not to change party allegiance from one election to the next, leading presidential candidates to concentrate their limited time and resources campaigning in those states that they believe they can swing towards them or stop states from swinging away from them, and not to spend time or resources in states they expect to win or lose. 

Because of the electoral system, the campaigns are less concerned with increasing a candidate&#x27;s national popular vote, tending instead to concentrate on the popular vote only in those states which will provide the electoral votes it needs to win the election, as many successful candidates have lost the popular vote but won the electoral college.

In past electoral results, Republican candidates would have expected to easily win most of the mountain states and Great Plains, such as Idaho, Wyoming, the Dakotas, Montana, Utah, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska, most of the South, including Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, South Carolina, Missouri, Texas, and West Virginia, as well as Alaska. Democrats usually take the Mid-Atlantic states, including New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware, New England, particularly Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, the West Coast states of California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, and the Southwestern states of Colorado and New Mexico, as well as the Great Lakes states of Illinois and Minnesota.

However, some states that consistently vote for one party at the presidential level occasionally elect a governor of the opposite party; this is currently the case in Vermont and Virginia which have Republican governors, as well as in Kentucky and Kansas, which currently have Democratic governors. Even in presidential election years, voters may split presidential and gubernatorial tickets. In 2024, this occurred in three states: North Carolina, Vermont and New Hampshire. Vermont and New Hampshire both elected Republican governors even as Democrat Kamala Harris won both states. North Carolina, despite voting for Republican Donald Trump, elected a Democratic governor. North Carolina has elected a Democratic governor in each concurrent gubernatorial election where Donald Trump was the Republican presidential nominee, by a notably wide margin in 2024. 

In Maine and Nebraska, the apportionment of electoral votes parallels that for U.S. senators and representatives. Two electoral votes go to the candidate who wins the plurality of the vote statewide, and a candidate gets an additional electoral vote for each congressional district in which they receive a plurality. Both of these states have relatively few electoral votes – a total of 4 and 5, respectively. Nebraska has split its votes since 1992, and Maine has done so since 1972. Each state has split its electoral votes only thrice since implementation: all three times Maine&#x27;s second district gave one vote to Donald Trump, in 2016, 2020 and 2024; while Obama in 2008, Biden in 2020, and Harris in 2024 obtained the Nebraska&#x27;s second district vote in their respective races.

== Competitive states ==
States where the election has a close result become less meaningful in landslide elections. Instead, states which vote similarly to the national vote proportions are more likely to appear as the closest states. For example, the states in the 1984 election with the tightest results were Minnesota and Massachusetts. A campaign strategy centered on them, however, would not have been meaningful in the Electoral College, as Democratic nominee Walter Mondale required victories in many more states than Massachusetts, and Republican Ronald Reagan still would have won by a large margin. Instead, the tipping-point state that year was Michigan, as it gave Reagan the decisive electoral vote. The difference in Michigan was nineteen percentage points, quite similar to Reagan&#x27;s national margin of eighteen percent. Michigan would have been more relevant to the election results had the election been closer.

Similarly, Barack Obama&#x27;s narrow victory in Indiana in the 2008 election inaccurately portrays its status as a battleground. Obama lost Indiana by more than ten percentage points in the closer 2012 election, but triumphed anyway as Indiana&#x27;s electoral votes were not directly needed for a coalition of 270 votes; the same scenario was with Missouri, where John McCain narrowly won by 4,000 votes in the 2008 election, but was won by Mitt Romney by nearly 10 points in 2012 election, indicating its GOP trend. Other lightly Republican leaning states such as North Carolina and Arizona were more plausible Democratic pick-ups in 2012. 

In 2012, the states of North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, and Virginia were decided by a margin of less than five percent. However, none of them were considered the tipping-point state, as Romney would not have been able to defeat Obama even if he had emerged victorious in all of them. Virginia was most in-step with the rest of the country. Virginians voted for Obama by just under 4 points, almost the exact same as the nation. Had the election come out closer, Romney&#x27;s path to victory would probably have involved also winning Wisconsin, Nevada, New Hampshire, or Iowa, as these states had comparable margins to Colorado, and had been battlegrounds during the election.

As many mathematical analysts have noted, however, the state voting in a fashion most similar to that of the nation as a whole is not necessarily the tipping-point. For example, if a candidate wins only a few states but does so by a wide margin, while the other candidate&#x27;s victories are much closer, the popular vote would likely favor the former. However, although the vast majority of the states leaned to the latter candidate in comparison to the entire country, many of them would end up having voted for the loser in greater numbers than did the tipping-point state. The presidential election in 2016 was a notable example, as it featured one of the largest historical disparities between the Electoral College and popular vote. 

Additionally, this &quot;split&quot; in votes was much larger in both directions than in previous elections, such as the 2000 election. In that election, Vice President Al Gore won the popular vote by less than 1 percent, while incoming president George W. Bush won the Electoral College by only 5 votes. In contrast, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over 2 percentage points. This meant that Donald Trump would have picked up New Hampshire, Nevada, and Minnesota if the popular vote had been tied, assuming a uniform shift among the battleground states. On the other hand, Clinton would have had to win the popular vote by at least 3 points to win the Electoral College, as Trump, the Republican nominee, won the tipping-point state of Wisconsin by less than 1 percent. 

In 2020, Joe Biden won the popular vote by over 4 percentage points but won the tipping point state of Pennsylvania by only 1 percent. This shows Donald Trump could win the election even if he lost the popular vote by over 3 percent and would have picked up Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin with a uniform shift among the states.

In 2024, Donald Trump won the popular vote by a narrow margin of 1.5%, while winning the tipping point state of Pennsylvania by a similarly narrow margin of 1.7% percent. This is evidence of an erosion of the popular vote advantage that Democratic candidates have typically enjoyed in recent elections, likely spurred by a significant narrowing of margins in safe blue states such as New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, which each saw dramatic shifts toward the Republican candidate, as well as dramatic increases in the Republican support in moderately red states such as Florida and Texas compared to previous cycles. 

Swing states have generally changed over time. For instance, the swing states of Ohio, Connecticut, Indiana, New Jersey and New York were key to the outcome of the 1888 election. Likewise, Illinois and Texas were key to the outcome of the 1960 election, Florida and New Hampshire were key in deciding the 2000 election, and Ohio was important during the 2004 election. Ohio has gained its reputation as a regular swing state after 1980, and did not vote against the winner between 1960 and 2020. In the 2024 election, Ohio and Florida had shifted rightward and were considered safe wins for Republicans. 

In fact, only three people have won the presidential election without winning Ohio since 1900: Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Joe Biden. Areas considered battlegrounds in the 2020 election were Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin, with Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin constituting the &quot;Big Five&quot; most likely to decide the Electoral College. In the end, Joe Biden won Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, NE-02, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, while Donald Trump won ME-02, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.

Campaign strategies are not universal in swing states. Statistical analytics website FiveThirtyEight notes that some swing states, such as New Hampshire, swing because they have many moderate, independent swing voters, and campaigning puts an emphasis on persuading voters. Contrasting this is Georgia, which is a swing state because it has large populations of Republican-leaning evangelical whites and Democratic-leaning Black voters and urban college-educated professionals, thus campaigns often concentrate on voter turnout.

==Determining swing states==
Presidential campaigns and pundits seek to keep track of the shifting electoral landscape. While swing states in past elections can be determined simply by looking at how close the vote was in each state, determining states likely to be swing states in future elections requires estimation and projection based on previous election results, opinion polling, political trends, recent developments since the previous election, and any strengths or weaknesses of the particular candidate involved. The swing-state &quot;map&quot; transforms between each election cycle, depending on the candidates and their policies, sometimes dramatically and sometimes subtly. 

For example, in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton overperformed in educated, suburban states such as Colorado and Virginia compared to past Democratic candidates, while Donald Trump performed above standard Republican expectations in the Rust Belt, such as Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. In addition, gradual shifts can occur within states due to changes in demography, geography, or population patterns. For example, many currently Republican states, like Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and West Virginia, had been battlegrounds as recently as 2004.

According to a pre-election 2016 analysis, the thirteen most competitive states were Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Arizona, Georgia, Virginia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Colorado, North Carolina, and Maine. Nebraska&#x27;s 2nd congressional district was (and is still as of 2024) also considered competitive. However, this projection was not specific to any particular election cycle, and assumed similar levels of support for both parties.

Ten weeks before the 2020 presidential election, statistical analytics website FiveThirtyEight noted that the electoral map is &quot;undergoing a series of changes&quot;, with some states moving rightward, other states moving leftward, and two states (Florida, until the 2020 election, and North Carolina) described as &quot;perennial&quot; swing states. Likewise, an analysis of results of the 2018 midterms indicated that the &quot;battleground states&quot; are changing, with Colorado and Ohio becoming less competitive and more Democratic and Republican, respectively, while Georgia and Arizona were slowly turning into swing states.

== Criticism ==

The Electoral College encourages political campaigners to focus most of their efforts on courting voters in swing states. States in which polling shows no clear favorite are usually targeted at a higher rate with campaign visits, television advertising, and get out the vote efforts by party organizers and debates. According to Katrina vanden Heuvel, a journalist for &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;four out of five&quot; voters in the national election are &quot;absolutely ignored&quot;.

Since most states use a winner-takes-all arrangement, in which the candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the state&#x27;s electoral votes, there is a clear incentive to focus almost exclusively on only a few undecided states. In contrast, many states with large populations such as California, Texas and New York have in recent elections been considered &quot;safe&quot; for a particular party, and therefore not a priority for campaign visits and money. Meanwhile, twelve of the thirteen smallest states are thought of as safe for either party – only New Hampshire is regularly a swing state. Additionally, campaigns stopped mounting nationwide electoral efforts in the last few months near/at the ends of the blowout 2008 election, but rather targeted only a handful of battlegrounds.

==Swing states by results==

This is a chart of swing states using the methodology of Nate Silver for determining tipping point states, but including the other states in close contention in recent elections, ranked by margin of victory. In this method, states and DC are ordered by margin of victory, then tabulating which states were required to get to 270+ electoral votes in margin order. The tipping point state, and the next 10 states with close margins on each side, are shown as the swing states in retrospect, along with the &quot;bias&quot; which is the difference between the final margin in the tipping point state and final popular vote margin. This takes into account inherent electoral college advantages; for example, Michigan was the closest state in 2016 by result, and Nevada was the closest state to the national popular vote result, but the tipping points that most mattered for assembling a 270 electoral vote coalition were Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

<text>Alexandra (Māori: &quot;Manuherikia&quot; or &quot;Areketanara&quot;) is a town in the Central Otago district of the South Island of New Zealand. It is on the banks of the Clutha River (at the confluence of the Manuherikia River), on State Highway 8, by road from Dunedin and south of Cromwell. The nearest towns to Alexandra via state highway 8 are Clyde seven kilometres to the northwest and Roxburgh forty kilometres to the south. State highway 85 also connects Alexandra to Omakau, Lauder, Oturehua, Ranfurly and on to Palmerston on the East Otago coast.

The town of Alexandra is home to people as of 

==History==
The town was founded during the Otago gold rush in the 1860s, and was named after Alexandra of Denmark by John Aitken Connell who surveyed the town. In a two-month period in 1862, two gold miners called Horatio Hartley and Christopher Reilly collected 34 kilograms of gold from the Cromwell Gorge, Hartley and Reilly travelled together to New Zealand after meeting in the Californian gold rush. They initially worked in secret to obtain as much gold as they could along the Cromwell gorge. In order to obtain the government&#x27;s reward on offer for gold discoveries, they made the site public.
This made the Clutha River and its tributaries famous for their gold. In a short time, 2000 miners had descended on Alexandra. Conditions were uninviting initially with a lack of food, equipment and wood. Many of the early miners were Chinese of Cantonese origin, with some suggesting Chinese made up as much as 50% of the mining population. During the goldrush days, a gold dredge named the &quot;Lady Molyneux&quot; captured 1234 ounces of gold in just one week. Goldmining the Clutha was a dangerous occupation. In 1863, there were 37 men who drowned in the Clutha river or its tributaries. Of these, 12 could not be named. In the 1870s, Chinese miners moved in to re-work claims that others had sold on. By 1889, most of the easy to access gold had been mined and leases were sold for virtually nothing. At this stage, stone fruit orchards gradually took over the local economy.When the river had run out of gold, the river banks were dredged. This was termed ‘paddock dredging’. This continued day and night between 1896 and 1924 and again between 1951 and 1963. The noise was ever present and loud and it also produced significant quantities of dust which plagued Alexandra. If the dredging hit hard rock, it interrupted the power supply to Alexandra and the lights of the entire town dimmed. The tailings from all the dredging now cover 170 hectares in a historic reserve known as the Earnscleugh Dredge Tailings.

In 1878, the Clutha river flooded many towns including Clyde and Alexandra. The Manuherikia valley &quot;resembled an inland sea&quot;. As a result of this event, the Alexandra suspension bridge was constructed between 1879 and 1882 after the bridge at Clyde failed in the 1878 flood. The Otago Central Railway line from Dunedin into Central Otago reached Alexandra in December 1906.

Originally referred to as &quot;Alexandra South&quot; to distinguish it from a North Island town with the same name, the word &quot;South&quot; was dropped in 1867 after the North Island town was renamed to &quot;Pirongia&quot;. It was known to miners of the day by several names: the &quot;Lower Township&quot;, the &quot;Junction Township&quot;, and &quot;Manuherikia&quot;. (The &quot;Upper Township&quot; was Dunstan, now Clyde.)

Many orchards were destroyed in the 1980s as a result of construction, 10 km upstream, of the Clyde High Dam, which is the country&#x27;s third largest hydroelectric power station. The railway line was closed after the completion of the Clyde Dam in 1990 and the lines were removed in 1990. In 2000, the Otago Central Rail Trail was opened allowing mountain bikers and walkers to traverse the rail corridor from Clyde through Alexandra and on to Middlemarch.

==Geography==

The town is a popular holiday destination mainly due to the hot and sunny climate during summer. There are many accommodation options in Alexandra.

Alexandra has had two bridges crossing the Clutha River, the current one opening in 1958.

===Climate===
Alexandra experiences an oceanic climate bordering on a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb/BSk&quot;). 

Alexandra is one of the farthest towns from a coastline and experiences warm summers and cold winters compared to the rest of New Zealand, with summer temperatures that can reach the mid 30&#x27;s °C (mid 90&#x27;s °F) and winter lows that drop around most years. Every year an average of 66 days will exceed and 92 nights will drop below . The hottest and coldest temperatures recorded in Alexandra (between 1971 and 2019) are (recorded on 5 February 2005 and 30 January 2018) and respectively. 

During times of high pressure, temperature inversions can form, keeping temperatures in Alexandra below freezing all day. 

Alexandra is one of the driest places in the country, often recording fewer than of rain each year, the majority of which falls in the summer half of the year. The town hold the New Zealand record for the lowest rainfall in one calendar year, recording just in 1964.

== Demography ==

Alexandra&#x27;s population was 1414 residents in 1951 and this had increased to 1823 residents in 1956 and then to 2292 residents in 1961.

Alexandra is described by Statistics New Zealand as a small urban area, and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is the seventh-largest urban area in Otago, and the second-largest urban area in the Central Otago District behind Cromwell.

== Economy ==

=== Viticulture ===
Grape production is another major industry in the Central Otago Wine Region. The first plantings of grapes were in 1864. Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris are some of the varieties that are grown in the vicinity. Alexandra has a number of vineyards that potentially are the world&#x27;s most southern. There are more than 25 vineyards in the vicinity of Alexandra. These include Three Miners Vineyard, Grasshopper Rock, Como Villa Estate, Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Pillar, Thyme Hill Vineyard, Leaning Rock Vineyard, Judge Rock, Immigrants Vineyard, Dunstan Road Wines, Alexandra Wine Company, Drumsara Wines, McArthur Ridge Vineyard and Perseverance Estate. A cycling trail called Pedal for Pinot gives visitors the opportunity to cycle around the cellar doors and sample a variety of local wines.

=== Horticulture ===
Alexandra is the service centre for a significant stone-fruit industry, which is celebrated by a blossom festival in the town each spring. The first orchards planted provided fruit for the mining community. Now, nectarines, apricots, cherries, peaches, plums and apples are grown and sold for both New Zealand and export markets. Seasonal work picking fruit is available during the summer and many tourists and Pacific Islanders come to New Zealand to work in Alexandra.

=== Pastoral farming ===
Sheep farming, particularly of merino sheep has occurred around Alexandra for many years. One of the original sheep runs was Galloway Station. This was established by Watson and Alexander Shennan in 1858.The brothers, from Scotland imported various breeds of sheep. In particular they acquired 15 merino rams and 27 merino ewes in 1861 from the King of Prussia&#x27;s Potsdam Stud, which cost the massive sum at that time of £2000. The Galloway Station was sub-divided in 1916.

=== Airport ===
The Alexandra Aerodrome is Alexandra&#x27;s only airport. SPANZ, NAC and Mount Cook Airlines were main users of the airport till the 1980s. It is home to the Central Otago Flying Club, and gliding. Commercial passenger flights are no longer scheduled; Queenstown International Airport is the nearest facility for those.

== Events ==

=== Blossom festival ===
Alexandra is perhaps best known for the Alexandra Blossom Festival, an annual event that began in 1957. The Festival celebrates the advent of Spring in the Central Otago District as evidenced by the blooming of the fruit trees.

=== Great Easter bunny hunt ===
Sixty rabbits were introduced by the Acclimatisation Society of Otago in 1866 and it only took five years for them to get established and to start eating the pasture land bare. They are prolific and a pest species around Alexandra. Each year at Easter, locals compete to shoot as many rabbits as possible to cull numbers. The event is run by the Alexandra Lions Club and it is also a great social occasion for the town. It has been run annually since the early 1990s. The event was cancelled in 2018 to allow the Otago Regional Council&#x27;s programme to introduce the rabbit virus RHDV1 K5.Unfortunately the virus did not have the desired impact on rabbit numbers that was expected and there are more rabbits around than ever. Due to the dry conditions in 2019, the fire risk was deemed to be extreme and the event was cancelled.In 2020 it was again cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The bunny hunt took place in 2021 with over 10,000 rabbits shot. It was thought not to have a significant impact on the overall rabbit population around Alexandra.

== Amenities ==

=== Alexandra swimming pool ===
The Alexandra swimming pool complex is run by the Central Otago District Council. It was built in 2003 and replaced the previous swimming pool known as the Centennial Baths. The indoor complex includes a 25m lap pool, a learners&#x27; pool and a spa pool. An outdoor pool is also open during the summer months. The complex is located within Molyneux Park.

=== Alexandra golf club ===
The Alexandra golf club was established in 1901. It moved to its present site alongside the Alexandra/Clyde highway in the mid-1960s and work started on the club house in 1970. Work occurred in 1974 redeveloping the layout of the 18 hole course. The course is relatively flat with well irrigated tree lined fairways. Rabbits were noted to be a problem at the golf course in 2019 and the golf club was in the process of exploring fencing options to keep the rabbits out.

=== Molyneux park ===
Molyneux Park is located on state highway 8. It is home to the swimming pool complex, netball courts, a first class cricket venue, the ice skating rink, the Alexandra bowls club and the Alexandra toy library.

=== Central Stories museum and art gallery ===

The Alexandra Museum and Art Gallery is known as Central Stories. The museum focusses on local history, in particular, geology; early explorers; social history; gold mining; Chinese immigration during the gold mining years; stone fruit orchards, farming and viticulture. It is located at 21 Centennial Avenue and is open Monday to Friday between 10am to 4pm and 11am to 2pm on weekends and public holidays.

=== Pioneer park ===
Pioneer Park was established in the late 1860s. There is a playground and botanic gardens located within it. There are also three artificial grass tennis courts located within the park.

=== Lower Manorburn dam ===
Located in the hills just outside of Alexandra, this large irrigation dam was built in the 1900s. It is a well known body of water for fishing, canoeing and swimming. In winter ice skating is popular when the dam freezes over.

=== Mountain biking ===
A portion of the Otago Central Rail Trail runs through Alexandra. The &quot;Mountain bikers of Alexandra&quot; club are active in building trails in the local area. There are a number of mountain bike trails at Alexandra Airport, Boot Hill, Clyde Lookout and Flat Top Hill. The award-winning trails at Flat Top Hill have been built in partnership with the Department of Conservation.

== Alexandra clock ==
A large clock was built on Knobbies Range overlooking Alexandra in 1968. Initially, there was some opposition to the proposal. A full size mock-up was placed on the proposed site for six weeks. Local reaction was assessed and it was overwhelmingly supportive of the idea. It cost around $3000 to build the clock. This included the foundations, steel markers, electrics, painting etc. The Jaycees club put in many hours of volunteer labour to the project. The clock has a diameter of 11 metres. The minute hand is 5.6m in length including the counterweight and the hour hand is 4m in length including the counterweight. It is lit up at night by 150 light bulbs (upgraded to LEDs in 2006 from the original torch bulbs). The LED lights have subsequently been upgraded to colour LEDs in 2018. At Easter an illuminated cross is placed on the hillside nearby. In April 2020, damage caused the clock to stop working. It appeared that &quot;someone swung on the hands’’ of the clock causing the clock to stop at 8:34.

== Air pollution ==
Alexandra suffers from air pollution, typically in winter. The main cause of air pollution in Alexandra is from domestic heating appliances that burn solid fuels (e.g. wood and coal). Air pollution peaks during winter mornings and evenings. The results from a study show that sub-freezing temperatures and still wind conditions at 8 am or 9 am can be used to predict high levels of PM10 that evening. Alexandra is one of the least windy towns in New Zealand. This, combined with its geography, being an inland basin, means that the smoke generated from domestic heating appliances stays sitting within the town environs. Daily PM10 concentrations regularly exceed the national guidelines from the month of May through to the month of August each year. Between 2005 and 2017 winter concentrations of PM10s have decreased about 30%. Despite this, Alexandra has &quot;some of the worst winter air quality in the country&quot;.

Pupils at Alexandra primary school were helping scientists at NIWA learn more about pollution in their town in a four-month project that will track where smoke comes from and where it goes over winter in 2018.

Alexandra had three high pollution nights, where PM10 particulate levels exceeded the national environmental standards, in winter 2021. This increased in winter 2022 to a total of four nights.

== Notable buildings ==

=== Shaky bridge ===
The Shaky bridge crosses the Manuherikia river and links Kerry Street and Graveyard Gully Road. It was completed in 1879. Leslie Duncan MacGeorge (1854–1939) designed the 60 metre long bridge. It was the only bridge crossing the Manuherikia river for twenty years. In 1906 a road and rail bridge was completed making the shaky bridge obsolete. It did not receive the required upkeep and earned its nickname of the &quot;shaky bridge&quot;. The small suspension bridge with its stone towers was saved by the Pioneer Bridge Committee. The Committee raised funds to restore the bridge. Today it is promoted as a tourist attraction and is only open to pedestrians.

=== Simmond&#x27;s boarding house ===
Simmond&#x27;s boarding house was built in 1882 and provided accommodation for over ninety years until it was converted into an office building in the 1970s. It was built by James Simmonds who also served as mayor of Alexandra.

=== Bendigo hotel ===
The Bendigo Hotel was situated on the corner of Tabert &amp; Rivers streets. The original Bendigo Hotel, was a wooden, single storied structure built in the 1860s. This original building was demolished in 1900. This was required by the Tuapeka Licensing Commission who stated that the building should be replaced, or the license revoked. The Bendigo Hotel was then rebuilt in 1900. The new hotel was a two storied brick structure. It contained 30 bedrooms and was of the standard of a first class city hotel at the time. Numerous alternations occurred to the building over the next 100 years. The Bendigo was flooded in December 1995 and again in November 1999. This led to the hotel being demolished and the construction of a floodbank in 2001 to protect Alexandra from flooding.

=== Alexandra courthouse ===

The old courthouse located in Alexandra&#x27;s Centennial Avenue was opened on 16 June 1879, it housed both the Warden&#x27;s and Magistrate&#x27;s Courts. it was built of stone. As mining was the main industry at the time the Warden&#x27;s Court was kept busy dealing with issues relating to mining. These included registration of claims and dealing with matters such as water races, business, licenses, roads, forgeries and other similar issues relating to mining. The Magistrate&#x27;s Court dealt with general legal matters. It was used as a courthouse until 1972. It is a Category 2 Historic Building. In 2006 the chimneys were renovated and it was repainted. It now operates as a cafe.

=== Vallance cottage ===
Vallance Cottage is a mud brick house built in 1896. It was home to a family of eleven at one stage. It is a category 2 listed building with Heritage New Zealand. In the 1970s, Vallance Cottage still had no running water inside and only cold running water in the separate wash-house.

== Mokomoko dryland sanctuary ==
In 2005, a group of Alexandra residents formed the Central Otago Ecological Trust. They aimed to reintroduce fauna that has been lost from the Alexandra basin. They established, in partnership with a number of other organisations, the Mokomoko Dryland Sanctuary. This lies near Alexandra in the hilly county. They established a 1.6 kilometre long predator proof fence which surrounds 14 hectares of land. This is now allowing native dryland vegetation to reestablish itself and a number of species of lizards and invertebrates to repopulate the sanctuary.

In 2018, around 150 skinks and geckos were introduced to the Mokomoko Dryland Sanctuary. Lizards that are endemic to the area include the Otago skink which can grow up to 300mm in total length jewelled geckos have also been introduced to the sanctuary. These were transferred from the Lammermoor Range. and the grand skink.

== Media ==

===Radio stations===
Following Mediaworks corporate 2013 decision to move all Central Otago and Lakes District live broadcast activity to Queenstown, Alexandra was left without a local radio station until the creation of independently owned Classic Gold Central in September 2013 on Blossom Festival Weekend.
Tramsmitting from a co-site with Radio Rhema in the Waikerikeri Valley on 91.9FM, the station, owned by longtime broadcasters Chris Diack and Bill Willis, has re-established the service of providing local information for the district. Classic Gold Central was re-branded as Local Radio Central sometime before 2018. On April 1, 2018, the station was purchased by new owners, who again re-branded the station as Radio Central. From the 1st of April 2018 Radio Central had transmitters located at Waikerikeri Valley (91.9), Cromwell (91.9), Roxburgh (94.3) and Wedderburn (104.3).

Independently owned radio station Blue Skies FM was established in 2001 to serve the local community, broadcasting to the Alexandra basin, Cromwell, the Maniototo, Teviot Valley and beyond. Blue Skies FM ceased broadcasting at the end of September &#x27;08 following a move by Mediaworks, who successfully negotiated a deal to take on the frequency to rebroadcast its Easy Listening Brand, The Breeze.

Alexandra once had its own local More FM station with the studios based in Alexandra. Previously, the station was known as Radio Central. Central Otago&#x27;s More FM broadcasts into Roxburgh, Clyde and Cromwell. Wānaka also has More FM, relayed from the Queenstown More FM station formerly known as Resort Radio.
Central Otago&#x27;s More FM is now networked from Studios in Queenstown.

Alexandra features a number of local FM stations that operate on the New Zealand Government&#x27;s &quot;low power FM&quot; scheme, including Classic Gold on 107.3FM and XS80s on 106.7FM. These stations operate on short range covering the main township only.

==Mayors==
Alexandra is now administered by the Central Otago District Council, with the current mayor being Tim Cadogan.

Many streets in Alexandra are named after mayors of the former Alexandra Borough.

== Government ==
Alexandra is currently part of the Southland electorate which was held in 2023 by Joseph Mooney of the National Party.

<doc id="429253" wikidata="Q7887280" url="?curid=429253" title="Unite the Right (Canada)">
<text>The Unite the Right () movement was a Canadian political movement which existed from around the mid-1990s to 2003. The movement came into being when it became clear that neither of Canada&#x27;s two main right-of-centre political parties, the Reform Party of Canada/Canadian Alliance (CA) and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (PC), was independently capable of defeating the governing Liberal Party. The objective of the movement, therefore, was to merge the two parties into a single party (or, if this was not possible, to find a power-sharing arrangement between the two parties). The goal of uniting the right was accomplished in December 2003 with the formation of the Conservative Party of Canada.

==1987–1993: Fragmentation on the political right==
The Reform Party came into being in 1987, due in part to opposition to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government that ruled Canada from 1984 to 1993. A significant number of Western Canadians had strongly disliked what they perceived as the Mulroney government&#x27;s pro-Quebec approach and rampant use of patronage. They also viewed the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord as not in the West&#x27;s best interests. Other Western conservatives felt that Mulroney&#x27;s government was not sufficiently neo-liberal in its fiscal taxation and federal spending policies while some social conservatives were critical of the government&#x27;s failed attempts to regulate and reduce abortion in Canada.

In the 1993 election, the upstart Reform Party won 52 seats in the west, and the once-powerful PCs led by newly minted Prime Minister Kim Campbell were reduced to only two seats in Parliament. Both parties were, however, almost completely shut out of Ontario and Quebec in this election, and also in the elections of 1997 and 2000. The two central Canadian provinces together represented over half the seats in the House of Commons; in the 1993, 1997 and 2000 elections, the total number of central Canadian seats held, collectively, by the Reform Party/Canadian Alliance and the PCs never rose above six, out of a total of over 170 available seats.

With two right-wing parties competing for power, it became apparent that unseating the governing Liberals would be next to impossible. In the 1997 election, both the PCs and the Reform Party respectively polled roughly 19% each in popular support. Reform emerged with 60 Western seats and Official Opposition status, while the demoralized PCs emerged from the brink of oblivion with 20 Eastern seats and regained party status (a minimum of 12 seats is required for official party status in the House of Commons of Canada, allowing the party to have seats on parliamentary committees, guaranteed speaking time in the Commons, additional office space in the east and west blocks of Parliament, and multimillion-dollar federal funding for party research and staffing). More importantly, the Liberals emerged with only a five-seat majority in the election, and many pundits suggested that the combined PC and Reform votes would have been enough to unseat the Liberals or at least reduce them to minority status.

The Liberals under Jean Chrétien had governed Canada since 1993, and were never really threatened by the divided right during the Chrétien era. Especially important in the Liberals&#x27; electoral success was the province of Ontario. From 1993 to 2004, the Liberals utterly dominated Canada&#x27;s most populous province. Both Reform and the PC Party received many votes, but because of the first past the post (FPTP) system, this was not enough to win more than a handful of Ontario&#x27;s approximately 103 seats. At the same time, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, who some suggested were kindred spirits in policy and direction to Reform and Blue Tory PCs, had formed a provincial government under Premier Mike Harris.

==Barriers to a merger==
There were many barriers to a merger. Polls had found that two-thirds of traditional PC voters would vote for the Liberals before endorsing a united Canadian Alliance/PC party. Some Westerners also had deep concerns that the new party would be dominated by Central Canada, much as they thought the Progressive Conservatives had been. Leadership and MPs from both sides of the division also opposed a 
merger out of concerns that both parties were distinct political entities and not part of a larger conservative movement.

==1995–1996: Early efforts to unite the right==
During the 1995 Quebec referendum, Reform leader Preston Manning implored the two sitting PC MPs, Elsie Wayne and party leader Jean Charest, to sit in Parliament with the Reform Party caucus. The combined weight of 52 Reform MPs and two PC MPs would have allowed a unified caucus to replace the 53-member separatist Bloc Québécois caucus as Her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition. Charest, however, refused to merge and instead focused his efforts on rebuilding the shattered PC Party.

In 1996, David Frum and Ezra Levant organized the &quot;Winds of Change&quot; conference in Calgary, an early attempt to encourage the Reform Party of Canada and Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to merge so that a united rightwing party could defeat the Liberal Party of Canada in the subsequent election. Manning and Charest were both invited to attend but declined.

==1997–2000: The United Alternative / Canadian Alliance==

After the second Liberal win in 1997, it became increasingly obvious that having two right-of-centre parties was splitting the vote and ensuring further Liberal majorities. Reform leader Manning was criticized by some members in his own party and by Western media for not &quot;broadening the popular base of Reform.&quot; Manning had originally suggested that the Reform Party was meant to be a new party, a third way as a populist alternative that could replace the complacent Liberals and PCs as a new national movement, but this hope was clearly not materializing beyond the Manitoba-Ontario border. There was some hope for cooperation from the PCs when Charest stepped down as leader in 1998. Several credible political figures, including Manitoba Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Brian Pallister, Major-General Lewis MacKenzie, former Reform MP Stephen Harper, and the former Alberta treasurer Jim Dinning were all encouraged to run as Unite the Right candidates by both sides of the conservative divide in the 1998 Progressive Conservative leadership convention. But the two candidates on the final ballot, Prairie anti- free-trade activist David Orchard and former Prime Minister Joe Clark, were both opposed to a merger. Clark was re-elected leader of the PC Party and insisted that the only way to unite the right would be for Reformers to join the PCs under the &quot;big tent&quot; of the Progressive Conservatives Party.

Reformers were convinced that a union would have to involve the creation of a new party, as opposed to one party being enveloped by the other. Therefore, the Reform Party launched a number of efforts to convince like-minded PCs to join with them in creating a new united right-of-centre movement for Canada regardless of the agenda of the PC leadership. A secondary goal of the movement was to at least have the current parties agree not to run two right-of-centre candidates in the same ridings in the next federal election. A series of informal conferences and mini-conventions were staged under the auspices of Manning and the Reform Party on the benefits of a &quot;United Alternative.&quot;

While the United Alternative movement was focused on creating a broader coalition for conservative voters, it had to compete with social conservatives who wanted the Reform Party to shift further to the right, as opposed to the moderate centre and Red Toryism. These members believed that the Reform Party could become a political opposite to the New Democratic Party by only running candidates in the West. In times of minority, the NDP has influenced left-leaning tendencies in the Liberal Party&#x27;s social policies. Many Reformers argued that the Reform Party could influence the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s social policies in a similar manner by forcing the PCs to adopt more right-wing solutions in order to obtain support from Western Reform MPs in future minority PC governments.

In 1998, under the auspices of 1993 Reform Party candidate and ardent social conservative Craig Chandler, a controversial &quot;Unite the Right&quot; conference was held in Toronto, Ontario. The conference attracted a great deal of negative media attention for not just including MPs and delegates from the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties, but also leadership officials from the right-wing social conservative Christian Heritage Party, Social Credit Party, the Confederation of Regions Party, Family Coalition Party of Ontario and delegates from the Freedom Party of Ontario. After this conference, polls were conducted that suggested that many Progressive Conservative supporters would rather vote Liberal than vote for a new merged Reform/PC political entity.

The efforts to create a United Alternative did not sit well with the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives. The PC Party eventually passed an amendment to the party&#x27;s constitution stating that the party had to run a candidate in every federal riding in the next election. Having been rebuffed by PC leader Joe Clark, Manning urged the Reform Party membership to &quot;Think Big&quot; and eventually a real &quot;United Right&quot; effort was launched. In early 2000, the Reform Party held two national conventions in Ottawa that culminated in its demise and the creation of the &quot;Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance&quot;, or CCRA. However, a number of pundits pointed out that if the word &quot;party&quot; was added on to the end of the name, the acronym would actually be CCRAP. Consequentially, the name was changed to the &quot;Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance&quot;, more commonly known as the Canadian Alliance.

Not all Reformers were in favour of the creation of a new right-wing political party. Some Reformers were actually populists who did not necessarily aspire to right-wing solutions for government in Canada. Led by Reform MPs Darrel Stinson and Myron Thompson, a protest movement was launched known as &quot;Grassroots United Against Reform&#x27;s Demise&quot; or GUARD. The movement sent letters and e-mails to party members and officials urging them to not vote in favour of a new party.

Ultimately, Manning&#x27;s bid to create a new party was successful, although the personal consequences for his initiative would be high. The Canadian Alliance leadership race was expected to be a &quot;pro forma&quot; contest in which Manning&#x27;s leadership would be easily reconfirmed. However, the race quickly became a contest. Many CA members felt that a new party needed a new leader. Eventually Manning&#x27;s bid for the CA leadership was defeated by Alberta Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and Provincial Treasurer Stockwell Day. While the party was seen by some as a happy union of former Reformers and Blue Tory PCs who were disaffected with Joe Clark&#x27;s Red Tory leadership, the Canadian Alliance was still seen by many as merely the Reform Party in new clothes. Furthermore, many Reformers became disaffected with the CA due to Manning&#x27;s ouster as the movement&#x27;s leader.

==2000–2002: Fragmentation of the Canadian Alliance ==
After a below-expectations result in the 2000 election and the failure of the CA to reduce Joe Clark&#x27;s PCs to independent status, a year of factional in-fighting began in 2001 over Stockwell Day&#x27;s troubled leadership of the Canadian Alliance. Several controversies surrounding Day&#x27;s personality, statements, and actions led to a number of disaffected CA officials and MPs, including party stalwarts Deborah Grey and Chuck Strahl, to formally break with the Alliance caucus. Thirteen MPs left the Canadian Alliance during this period of instability. The thirteen MPs sat as the Democratic Representative Caucus (DRC) and eventually decided to affiliate themselves with the PCs, sitting as one group in the House of Commons and holding joint meetings. The DRC also launched its own website and began setting up &quot;Democratic Reform Party&quot; constituency associations in anticipation of a snap election.

After the near collapse of the Canadian Alliance and the rise in defections to the DRC, it appeared that the right in Canada would remain fractious and fragmented into the foreseeable future. From September 2001 to May 2002, three separate elected right-wing political entities existed in the House of Commons (the PCs, the CA and the DRC). Many journalists and media analysts were convinced that the Right would totally melt down in a future election with so many conflicting factions competing for the same voter base. When asked by reporters in January 2002 about the troubles on the right, Liberal Heritage Minister Sheila Copps aptly conveyed the glee of the governing Liberals at the fractiousness in the conservative movement when she quipped, &quot;burn, baby, burn!&quot; Many political pundits were convinced that with no credible national alternative, the Liberals would easily cruise to a fourth straight majority victory in a future 2004 election. The almost constant turmoil and change in leadership of the Official Opposition between 2000 and 2002 led to a fair perception that the Chrétien government was getting a free ride from a hived opposition.

==2002: New leadership==
In April 2002, Stockwell Day was replaced as leader of the Canadian Alliance by Stephen Harper, one of the original &quot;Class of &#x27;88&quot; founders of the Reform Party. Unlike Day, Harper proved to be an able leader and managed to repair most of the damage that his predecessor&#x27;s leadership had caused. With Harper at the helm, all but two DRC MPs who had left the party&#x27;s caucus returned to the Canadian Alliance. With Day no longer running the Canadian Alliance, a merger was also much more agreeable to many stalwart Tory members. PC leader Joe Clark, who had spurned off many attempts to unite the right during his leadership, announced his impending retirement as PC leader in August 2002 after the PC-DRC Coalition Caucus dissolved. A leadership election was scheduled for May 2003.

On May 31, 2003, Peter MacKay of Nova Scotia won the PC leadership election. Unlike Clark, MacKay supported open discussions on the concepts of a united party, but promised that, on his watch, no full-fledged union would take place. Shortly after becoming leader, MacKay signalled his openness to broad &quot;talks&quot; with the Canadian Alliance with regard to creating more unity on the right.

==2003: Merger negotiations==
Over the summer and autumn of 2003, a series of protracted negotiations took place between PC and CA &quot;emissaries&quot;: Bill Davis, Don Mazankowski and Loyola Hearn for the PCs and Gerry St. Germain, Ray Speaker and Scott Reid for the CA. The identities of the emissaries was public knowledge, but the participation of Belinda Stronach (daughter of auto-parts magnate Frank Stronach) as chair and moderator for the discussions was not publicly known until later.

The negotiations were largely motivated by the juggernaut takeover of the Liberal Party by the extremely popular and successful former Liberal finance minister Paul Martin, and the marked reduction in membership and political donations for both parties due to voter frustration with the status quo Liberal hegemony. Polls showed both the beleaguered PC and Alliance parties losing a large number of seats in the next election to a Martin-led Liberal team across Canada if an amenable solution was not found.

==2003–2004: Creation of the Conservative Party of Canada==
The goal of a united right was realized in the Autumn of 2003. The summer negotiations eventually produced the Conservative Party Agreement-in-Principle between the PCs and the CA on the establishment of a new Conservative Party of Canada. On October 16, 2003, Alliance leader Stephen Harper and Progressive Conservative leader Peter MacKay announced the formation of the new united conservative party. Both leaders insisted that the union was not about egos, and was really about making an enormous contribution to protecting tangible democratic freedoms and political choice in Canada. Harper was widely quoted by many media officials during the press conference when he stated, &quot;Our swords will henceforth be pointed at the Liberals, not at each other.&quot;

The main sticking point during the autumn negotiations had been the method of choosing the merged party&#x27;s leader. The PCs pushed for an equal number of votes for each riding that would benefit their lower but much more nationally representative membership (65,000); the Alliance hoped for a one-member one vote system that would benefit their much larger, but centralized Western membership (120,000). Harper conceded the issue. In early December, 95.9% of the CA membership approved the union, and 90.4% of the PC Party delegates also endorsed the initiative in a national convention. The party was officially formed on December 7, 2003. Harper was elected leader of the fledgeling Conservative Party of Canada on March 20, 2004, by the new party&#x27;s 350,000 members spread out across 301 equally weighted federal ridings. Peter MacKay was appointed deputy leader.

==Aftermath==
Months later, Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin called for a general election. However, in the interim between the formation of the new party and the selection of its new leader, investigations into the Canadian Sponsorship scandal and the investigation by the Gomery Commission had knocked some wind out of the Liberal Party&#x27;s political sails, resulting in the election being backed up to late June as opposed to early April. This allowed the Conservatives to be more prepared for the race, unlike the 2000 snap election. For the first time since the 1984 election, the Liberal Party would have to deal with a united conservative opposition.

Polls indicated an increase in support for the new Conservative Party and by all pollster indications by mid-campaign, it seemed as if Harper was on the verge of becoming Prime Minister of a minority government. But even at their highest level of support the Conservatives were still some percentage points off the combined total of the two separate right-wing parties that had run in the last election. A number of prominent ex-PCs also chose to support the Liberals. These included MPs Scott Brison, Keith Martin, and John Herron, who crossed the floor to the Liberals. Lukewarm endorsements of Liberal Party candidates at the onset of the campaign were extended by former PC MPs Joe Clark, Brian Mulroney, André Bachand, Rick Borotsik, and former federal PC Party president Bruck Easton.

Harper&#x27;s new Conservatives emerged from the election with a larger parliamentary caucus of 99 MPs. Chuck Cadman, a former CA MP who failed to win the Conservative Party nomination in his riding, was re-elected as an independent. The Liberals were reduced to a thin minority government, relegating the governing party to obtaining support from at least two of the three opposition parties to pass legislation.

In the 2006 Canadian federal election, after a decade of work, the Conservatives seemed to attain their goal of being an electable &quot;United Alternative&quot; when they were given a minority government by the electorate. In the 2011 federal election, the Conservatives under Harper won a majority government, the first majority for a main right-of-centre party since the defeat of the Campbell PC Party in 1993.

==Provincial &#x27;Unite the Right&#x27;==
The term &#x27;Unite the Right&#x27; has been used to describe the union of centre-right parties in provinces with a strong New Democratic Party (NDP). United in one right-leaning party, individuals who would vote either Liberal or Conservative federally have joined at different occasions to stop the left-leaning NDP. Examples of this are the Liberal Party of British Columbia and the Saskatchewan Party.
Between 1941 and 1951, there was a Liberal–Conservative alliance to stop the rise of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the coalition was dissolved by the Liberals in 1952. Historically, the British Columbia Social Credit Party was British Columbia&#x27;s right-leaning coalition party between 1952 and 1991. In 2004, the British Columbia Unity Party and British Columbia Conservative Party alongside other right-leaning parties entered into unsuccessful merger negotiations. Between 2022 and 2023 the Liberal Party changed their name to BC United and changed the colours of the party teal and pink.

In Alberta, the Alberta Party Political Association, known in its short form as the Alberta Party, began as an alliance of the Social Credit Party of Alberta, Western Canada Concept, and the Heritage Party of Alberta in 1986. In 2006, the Alberta Alliance entered into merger negotiations with the Alberta Party and the Social Credit Party. The Social Credit Party terminated merger discussions, the Alberta Alliance merged with the Wildrose Party of Alberta to create the Wildrose Alliance, and the Alberta Party has shifted to become a centrist party. In 2017, the renamed Wildrose Party and the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta merged to form the United Conservative Party.

In the 1970s, the Social Credit Party of Saskatchewan merged into the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan. Eventually members of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservatives united to create the Saskatchewan Party.

From 1936 to 1970, the Union Nationale in Quebec was a coalition party of right-wing Liberals and Conservatives.

In August 2024 prior to the 2024 British Columbia general election, BC United suspended their 2024 election campaign and withdrew all their candidates to endorse the Conservative Party of British Columbia. BC United leader Kevin Falcon claimed that the decision was necessary to prevent vote-splitting that would ultimately benefit the governing New Democratic Party.

<doc id="429254" wikidata="Q5630328" url="?curid=429254" title="HMAS Duchess (D154)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Duchess was a [[destroyer]] that served in the [[Royal Navy]] asHMS &quot;Duchess from 1952 to 1964, and in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) from 1964 to 1980. She was laid down by John I. Thornycroft and Company, and commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1952.

Initially assigned to the Home Fleet, &quot;Duchess&quot; spent her early career on exercises and port visits. She was involved in celebrations for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II during 1953, and escorted the royal yacht in 1954. The destroyer was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet in late 1954, and was involved in exercises, port visits, and anti-weapons-smuggling patrols of Cyprus. During the 1956 Suez Crisis, &quot;Duchess&quot; operated as plane guard and escort to the British carrier force, and was the last ship to leave Port Said after the British-French invasion failed. The destroyer was reassigned to the Home Fleet in early 1957, then was sent back to the Mediterranean as leader of the 5th Destroyer Squadron later that year. A modernisation refit ran from late 1958 to the start of 1961, after which, &quot;Duchess&quot; resumed operations with the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1963, tensions leading to the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation resulted in &quot;Duchess&quot; being assigned to the Far East Fleet as part of a strengthening of British assets in South East Asia.

Following the 1964 &quot;Melbourne&quot;-&quot;Voyager&quot; collision, &quot;Duchess&quot; was loaned to the RAN as a temporary replacement for . The ship was deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve throughout the 1960s, and operated as an escort for the Vietnam War troopship on several occasions. The original four-year loan was extended to 1972, at which point the ship was purchased outright by the Australian government. &quot;Duchess&quot; was converted into a training ship during 1973 and 1974, and spent the rest of her career operating on midshipman training cruises in Australian, New Zealand, and South Pacific waters. &quot;Duchess&quot; was replaced in the training role in 1977, and was decommissioned. The destroyer was sold for scrap in 1980.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Daring&quot; class was an evolution of the Battle-class destroyer; larger and with a heavier armament built around three twin turrets. Sixteen &quot;Daring&quot;s were provisionally ordered on 20 July 1944, as part of the 1944 wartime construction programme. &quot;Duchess&quot; was the last of eight to have her order confirmed, on 29 March 1945, the other eight were later cancelled as unnecessary due to the end of World War II. Their size and capability made the ships capable of performing duties previously restricted to light cruisers, and as the destroyer classification was initially considered inappropriate, they were referred to as &quot;&quot;Daring&quot;-class warships&quot; for the first part of their careers.

As designed, the &quot;Daring&quot;-class ships had a standard displacement of 2,950 tons, with a full load displacement of 3,580 tons. Length was overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Propulsion machinery consisted of two oil-fuelled boilers (for &quot;Duchess&quot;, these were supplied by Foster Wheeler), connected to Parsons double reduction geared turbines from English Electric, which supplied to the ship&#x27;s two propeller shafts. Top speed was , with an effective range of , while a cruising speed of allowed the ship to cover . &quot;Duchess&quot;, along with three of her sister ships, were fitted with alternating current internal electrics; a break from Royal Navy practice. The intended ship&#x27;s company for &quot;Duchess&quot; was 278.

The main armament of a &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyer consisted of six QF 4.5-inch Mk I – V naval guns, arranged in three twin turrets, two located forward, the third aft. For anti-aircraft warfare, the ships were fitted with four to six 40 mm Bofors guns: a reduction from the wartime-intended eight. Both main and anti-aircraft guns were radar-controlled. Two 5-tube launchers for 21 inch (533 mm) torpedoes were installed, along with a Squid anti-submarine mortar.

&quot;Duchess&quot; was laid down by John I. Thornycroft and Company of Woolston at Southampton on 8 July 1948. Construction of the &quot;Daring&quot; class was a transition away from riveting as a method of hull fabrication: some ships had a mix of riveting and welding, while &quot;Duchess&quot;″s hull was all-welded. She was launched on 9 April 1951 by the Countess Mountbatten of Burma, and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 23 October 1952.

==Operational history==
===Royal Navy===
====1953–1956====
&quot;Duchess&quot; was initially assigned to the British Home Fleet in January 1953. During January, the ship was involved in training exercises with other Home Fleet units. On 26 January, while alongside in Portland Harbour, a furnace explosion and oil fire in A boiler room killed a stoker and severely burned three others. Although able to sail that afternoon, it took a further ten days of dockyard work to repair the damage. During February and March, &quot;Duchess&quot; and other ships of the Home Fleet sailed to Gibraltar for exercises. Most of April was taken up with self-maintenance, and May was spent on further training. At the end of May, &quot;Duchess&quot;, , and sailed to London, where they participated in the opening celebrations of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. After a brief visit to the Isle of Wight, &quot;Duchess&quot; sailed to Spithead for the Coronation Fleet Review, which occurred on 15 June. After the review, &quot;Duchess&quot;, &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, and visited east coast ports before sailing to Invergordon for fleet exercises. During the exercises, &quot;Duchess&quot; was plane guard for the carrier . &quot;Duchess&quot; returned to Portsmouth in July, underwent six weeks of maintenance, then sailed on 1 September to rejoin &quot;Eagle&quot; and other ships for exercises in the Denmark Strait. The exercise ended on 3 October, and after transporting personnel of 812 Naval Air Squadron to Loch Goyle, &quot;Duchess&quot; joined &quot;Eagle&quot; while the latter undertook flying training. On 6 October, a helicopter crashed while attempting to deliver mail to the destroyer: &quot;Duchess&quot;″ seaboat was able to rescue one of the two flight crew, while the other sank with the helicopter. &quot;Duchess&quot; continued to accompany &quot;Eagle&quot; until 24 October, when she detached to return to Portsmouth. The rest of 1953, along with most of January 1954, was spent in refit.

On 5 February, &quot;Duchess&quot; joined units of the Home Fleet on the Spring Training Cruise. The cruise included multi-national exercises in the Mediterranean, a port visit to Oran, and a joint Home-Mediterranean Fleets exercise. &quot;Duchess&quot; returned to Portsmouth on 23 March. On 29 April, the destroyer departed for Gibraltar to meet the royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;, which was carrying Queen Elizabeth II on the final legs of her Commonwealth Tour. &quot;Duchess&quot; was part of the escort force until &quot;Britannia&quot; reached the Thames Estuary on 13 May. The destroyer then proceeded to Invergordon for Home Fleet exercises. On 19 June, &quot;Duchess&quot; and sister ship were detached for a three-week flag-showing cruise around the Baltic Sea. Port visits were made to Oslo, Copenhagen, and Stockholm before &quot;Duchess&quot; returned to Portsmouth. On 31 August, the ship was paid off and recommissioned. She was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, and sailed on 10 September for Malta. On 15 October, &quot;Duchess&quot; was part of a demonstration of naval power for the Emperor of Ethiopia. The rest of the year was spent on exercises, including NATO exercise Novex 54, along with port visits to Elba with the cruiser in November. In early January 1955, &quot;Jamaica&quot; and &quot;Duchess&quot; made a formal visit to Algiers, which was then followed by more exercises. On 24 March, while moored at Naples, &quot;Duchess&quot; was rammed by the United States merchant ship SS &quot;Excambion&quot;. Damage to the destroyer included punctured hull plating on the starboard bow, impact damage to the starboard stern plates where the collision forced them into the wharf, and damage to the superstructure. Temporary repairs were effected, and the destroyer was able to sail to the Malta Dockyard on 30 March. Repairs took most of April, and it was not until 22 May that the ship was deployed again, on a cruise to the eastern Mediterranean. &quot;Duchess&quot; visited Istanbul, Alexandria, and Cyprus before returning to Malta&#x27;s Grand Harbour on 22 June. Two days later, with her Mediterranean deployment at an end, &quot;Duchess&quot; departed for Portsmouth via Gibraltar. On her 1 July arrival, the destroyer was docked for maintenance.

Resuming operations on 28 September, &quot;Duchess&quot; sailed to Scottish waters for exercises: first anti-submarine and torpedo firing training off Clyde, then plane guard duties near Rosyth while &quot;Eagle&quot;″s aircraft practiced high-altitude intercepts. After a visit to Hamburg, the destroyer returned to Portland. Exercises and port visits continued into 1956, and on 21 February, &quot;Duchess&quot; paid off and recommissioned at Portsmouth Dockyard. On 3 March, the destroyer sailed to rejoin the Mediterranean Fleet. After a series of working up exercises, &quot;Duchess&quot; participated in the 60-ship Exercise Medflex Dragon in April. During the exercise, the naval correspondent for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was convinced by the officers to place a small article in the paper jokingly asking for &quot;any spare coronets&quot; to decorate the wardroom with. In response, Anne, Duchess of Westminster, arranged to have her coronet supplied to the destroyer. Medflex Dragon concluded on 20 April, and &quot;Duchess&quot; underwent six weeks of maintenance. Port visits to Istanbul and Golcuck followed, along with a stint patrolling the Cyprus coastline to intercept Greek weapons smugglers. She returned to Malta in mid-July, and was in Grand Harbour when the Suez Canal was claimed and nationalised by Egypt.

====Suez Crisis====

The Mediterranean Fleet began gearing up to retaliate, with &quot;Duchess&quot; undertaking shore bombardment and convoy escort training during August and September, and also serving as plane guard to &quot;Eagle&quot; as the carrier worked up. On 29 October, &quot;Duchess&quot; left Malta to join the escort of the carriers &quot;Eagle&quot;, , and . The carrier force arrived off the Egyptioan coast on 31 October, and on 1 November, airstrikes commenced. During this, &quot;Duchess&quot; was plane guard for &quot;Eagle&quot;. On 6 November, the joint British-French invasion commenced, with the destroyer escorting one of the landing craft groups into shore, then standing by off Port Said for anti-air and anti-submarine defence. During 7 and 8 November, &quot;Duchess&quot; performed patrols off Port Said and was rotated through the plane guard stations of all three carriers. On 9 November, &quot;Duchess&quot; departed for Malta. She returned to Port Said on 17 November, and was again attached to the carrier force as an escort and plane guard. From 27 November to 16 December, the destroyer was sent to Cyprus for more anti-smuggler patrols, but the ship was recalled to cover the final withdrawal of British forces from Port Said. She remained in or near Port Said Harbour until 22 December: although due to sail that morning with the last troop convoy, &quot;Duchess&quot; remained on station until 20:00 in the unsuccessful hope that a junior officer of the West Yorkshire Regiment kidnapped early in the crisis would be returned. Consequently, &quot;Duchess&quot; was the last Royal Navy vessel to leave Port Said at the end of the Suez Crisis.

====1957–1964====
After spending Christmas at Grand Harbour, &quot;Duchess&quot; sailed from Malta on 1 January 1957 with sister ships and , bound for Portsmouth. After a three-month maintenance docking, &quot;Duchess&quot; was assigned to the Home Fleet. On 17 May, &quot;Duchess&quot; and &quot;Diamond&quot; sailed to meet the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; at the River Humber. &quot;Britannia&quot; was conveying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh to Denmark for a state visit. The two destroyers accompanied the royal yacht to Copenhagen, then back to the Moray Firth at the visit&#x27;s conclusion. On 28 May, the destroyers rejoined the Home Fleet for a fleet review. The destroyers were then assigned to escort the carrier , with the three ships departing on 30 May for the International Naval Review at Hampton Roads in the United States. The review occurred on 12 June, after which &quot;Duchess&quot; sailed to Bermuda, then back to the United Kingdom. On her return, the ship visited Liverpool for the 750th anniversary of King John&#x27;s Charter founding the city, then proceeded to Portsmouth. On 27 August, &quot;Duchess&quot; paid off and was recommissioned.
On 3 September, &quot;Duchess&quot; left Portsmouth to join the Mediterranean Fleet as leader of the 5th Destroyer Squadron. Workups were conducted at Silema Creek during September, followed by port visits to Tripoli and Civitavecchia in October, then self-maintenance and day sails from Malta for the rest of the year. 1958 commenced with a seven-week Cyprus patrol. By the end of the patrol on 21 February, the destroyer had developed a leak in her hull, but was able to reach Malta without difficulty. March consisted of participation in Exercise Marjex, followed by port visits to Taranto and Ancona, joint exercises with the Italian Navy, and a visit to Venice before returning to Malta. Major fleet exercises occurred in April and early May. &quot;Duchess&quot; was due to return to the United Kingdom in May, but unrest in Lebanon (which would escalate into the 1958 Lebanon crisis) required the destroyer to join a response force off Cyprus, which she remained with until 4 July. The destroyer sailed to Malta, then Portsmouth, and was docked for maintenance after arriving on 11 July. Work concluded in September, and &quot;Duchess&quot; spent the next three months undertaking exercises and port visits in British, Dutch, and French waters. The destroyer reached Spithead on 9 December, and was paid off into reserve later that day. The destroyer was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard hands for a two-year refit. Modifications during this period included the deletion of the aft torpedo launcher and its replacement with a deckhouse for additional accommodation, introduction of centralised messing arrangements, and fitting of air-conditioning to the operations room and sickbay. Intentions at the time were to install a Sea Cat missile launcher on the roof of the new deckhouse during a later refit, but in 1964, the decision was made to fit the launcher to new-build ships only.

&quot;Duchess&quot; was recommissioned on 3 January 1961, with post-refit workups and maintenance dominating the ship&#x27;s activities until early April. From April until July, she was involved in a program of anti-submarine warfare training and general exercises, interspersed with short maintenance periods. On 24 July, &quot;Duchess&quot; sailed from Portsmouth, bound for Malta and the Mediterranean Fleet. On 7 August, while en route, a port visit to Ajaccio was almost cancelled when a possible mutiny aboard a British merchant ship was reported: the destroyer was to sail to assist, but was not required. &quot;Duchess&quot; reached Grand Harbour on 18 August, and was drydocked for maintenance. Returning to service in September, the rest of &quot;Duchess&quot;″ year was dominated by exercises and flag-showing port visits. Exercises and port visits resumed in January 1962, and continued until 26 March, when the destroyer left Malta heading for Portsmouth. In addition to the schedule of Home Fleet exercises, &quot;Duchess&quot; made official visits to Stockholm and Helsinki with in May, underwent refit from July to October, as in November was part of the search for the helicopter that crashed off St David&#x27;s Head carrying Lord Windlesham. On 17 December, the ship&#x27;s fifth commission was paid off.

&quot;Duchess&quot; was recommissioned on 2 January 1963. Originally intended to be deployed with the Mediterranean Fleet, the December 1962 Brunei Revolt and tensions in South East Asia that would shortly escalate into the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation prompted a strengthening of British assets in the region, including the assignment of &quot;Duchess&quot; to the Far East Fleet. The destroyer left Portsmouth on 8 April bound for Singapore, with visits en route to Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, and Aden. Arriving on 12 June, the ship spent the next few weeks on day exercises, before being docked in the King George VI Graving Dock for three weeks of maintenance. Tactical exercises took up late July and early August, after which, &quot;Duchess&quot; was deployed to patrol off North Borneo and Sarawak. A visit to Hong Kong occurred in early September, followed by guardship duties off Sandakan. Further patrols of North Borneo occurred in October, and on 7 November, the destroyer was called to assist the British merchantman &quot;Woodburn&quot;, which had run aground off Singapore&#x27;s Horsburgh Lighthouse. Exercises continued until 23 December, when &quot;Duchess&quot; arrived at Singapore for maintenance and leave. She resumed operations on 10 February 1964, transporting a contingent of Gurkhas to the Sarawak River, then visited Hong Kong.

===Transfer===
Following the loss of the Australian-built &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyer in a collision with the aircraft carrier on 10 February 1964, both the United Kingdom and the United States offered to loan ships to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as a temporary replacement; the Royal Navy offering &quot;Duchess&quot; or while the United States Navy offered two destroyers: US Ships and . The Admiralty suggested &quot;Defender&quot; because she had just completed a major modernisation, and &quot;Duchess&quot; because her location in South East Asia meant she could be handed over quickly. &quot;Duchess&quot; was seen as the more favourable vessel for the British offer: in addition to the proximity, the ship was due to undergo refit in June, and doing so while in Australian hands meant the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) could make any modifications they felt necessary. Unlike &quot;Duchess&quot;, &quot;Defender&quot;″s internal electrics were configured for DC power, and the ship lacked air-conditioning.

The loan of &quot;Duchess&quot; to the RAN was offered on 18 February, and accepted on 25 February by the Australian government. The loan period was for four years, with no cost for the ship itself, although the RAN would be financially responsible for running costs and modifications. During the loan period, the RAN intended to construct two modified frigates ( and ) as permanent replacements. &quot;Duchess&quot; concluded her exercise program on 9 March, and returned to Singapore for maintenance. She left Singapore for Australia on 6 April, visiting Darwin and Townsville before reaching Sydney on 19 April. The ship was handed over to the RAN that day.

The destroyer was then sailed to Williamstown Naval Dockyard for modification. On 8 May, the handover was completed, and the ship was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS &quot;Duchess&quot;. Refits were completed in November, and the destroyer spent the rest of the year undertaking trials and working up exercises.

===Royal Australian Navy===

From January to March 1965, &quot;Duchess&quot; was deployed to the Far East, and undertook numerous patrols of the Malaysian and Borneo coasts. In late May, &quot;Duchess&quot; was assigned to the escort screen for the troopship as she made her first of twenty-five Vietnam War troop transport runs to Vũng Tàu. &quot;Duchess&quot; escorted the former carrier for the entire voyage, with the two ships returning to Sydney on 5 July. After a maintenance period, &quot;Duchess&quot; was deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve (FESR) on 11 August. After a short period of patrols, the destroyer and were detached to meet &quot;Sydney&quot; off Manus Island on 20 December, and joined the troopship on her second voyage to Vietnam. The three ships reached Vũng Tàu on 28 September, and departed two days later: after clearing the Market Time area, the two destroyers broke off and headed for Hong Kong. A brief period of maintenance concluded on 26 October, and &quot;Duchess&quot; resumed patrols until the end of the year. 1966 commenced with more Borneo patrols and a stint at guardship at Tawau. The destroyer returned to Darwin on 2 March, then sailed to Sydney for a seven-month refit. The rest of the year was spent exercising in eastern Australian waters.

In January 1967, the destroyer was again deployed to the FESR. As the Confrontation had concluded, the deployment was characterised by fewer patrols and more exercises and port visits. During the six-month assignment, &quot;Duchess&quot; called into Telok Kekek, Pulau Langkawi, Pulau Song Song, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Singapore. She returned to Sydney on 17 June and docked for refits. On 12 October, the four-year loan of the ship was extended to April 1972. The refit concluded on 3 June 1968, and the destroyer was assigned to multinational exercises; first with the Royal New Zealand Navy off Auckland, then with British, New Zealand, and American units in the Solomon Sea. &quot;Duchess&quot; was then deployed to the FESR, and arrived in Singapore on 10 October. A program of port visits was interrupted in November by the need to escort &quot;Sydney&quot; on her twelfth Vietnam voyage. On 18 November, &quot;Duchess&quot; met &quot;Sydney&quot; off Singapore, and accompanied the troopship to and from the warzone, before sailing to Hong Kong. Official visits to ports in South Korea and Japan followed, with &quot;Duchess&quot; back in Hong Kong for the Christmas-New Year break. January and February 1969 saw the destroyer travel as far west as Pakistan. The destroyer returned to Singapore on 25 March, via Thailand and Hong Kong, then after a short exercise period, the destroyer headed for Sydney. Maintenance and local exercises dominated the ship&#x27;s schedule until November, when she headed north to escort &quot;Sydney&quot; on the latter&#x27;s fifteenth voyage. After reaching Vũng Tàu on 28 November, then escorting the troopship from the warzone, &quot;Duchess&quot; peeled off to commence another FESR deployment. After a short maintenance period in Singapore, the destroyer visited Subic Bay, then headed to Hong Kong for the end of the year.

After participating in a week of fleet exercises in mid-January 1970, &quot;Duchess&quot; began a sequence of port visits: Port Swettenham, Kota Kinabalu, Manila, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Osaka (coinciding with Expo &#x27;70), Kobe, and Subic Bay before returning to Singapore. This was followed by SEATO exercises in the South China Sea during March and April. &quot;Duchess&quot; returned to Sydney on 5 June, and was docked for a refit, which lasted until 8 February 1971. On 18 March, &quot;Duchess&quot; was again deployed to the Far East. The destroyer met &quot;Sydney&quot; off Singapore on the troopship&#x27;s nineteenth on 3 April. The two ships arrived in Vũng Tàu on 5 April, and returned to Hong Kong on 8 April. After a sequence of port visits, &quot;Duchess&quot; and met &quot;Sydney&quot; on 17 May for transportation run twenty. Vũng Tàu was reached on 22 May, with departure a day later. &quot;Duchess&quot; sailed to Hong Kong, then on 8 June departed for Australia, arriving on 25 May and commencing a mid-cycle docking which ran until 13 November. In January 1972, &quot;Duchess&quot; joined , , and for a task group deployment to Asian waters. The deployment included SEATO exercises and port visits to Port Klang and Surabaya, before the ships arrived in Fremantle on 14 April. After proceeding to Sydney for maintenance, &quot;Duchess&quot; resumed exercising in local waters. During a surface firing exercise on 25 July, a shell from B turret hit one of the elevated barrels of A turret. In August, with her loan period up, &quot;Duchess&quot; was purchased outright from the Royal Navy for £150,000. After a midshipman training cruise to Port Moresby in August, the ship spent the rest of the year on exercises and training.

On 5 January 1973, &quot;Duchess&quot; arrived at Williamstown Naval Dockyard for conversion into a training ship. The aft funnel was streamlined, and the remaining torpedo launcher, aft gun turret, and Squid mortar were all removed. This allowed for the installation of an extended aft superstructure, with classrooms, instructor offices, and additional accommodation for the embarked trainees. The former turret&#x27;s loading bay was converted into library and study areas. A semi-enclosed charthouse was fitted above and behind the bridge for navigation training. The refit concluded on 14 August 1974, with &quot;Duchess&quot; replacing as the RAN&#x27;s dedicated training vessel. From January 1975 to July 1976, &quot;Duchess&quot; operated on a sequence of training cruises, visiting ports along the eastern Australian coast, as well as New Zealand and the South Pacific. She was docked from July to October at Cockatoo Island Dockyard to combat hull corrosion, then resumed her training schedule. Her final training cruise ran during August and September 1977, after which, &quot;Duchess&quot; was replaced by .

==Decommissioning and fate==
Handover of training duties to &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; was done on 23 September 1977. On 23 October, &quot;Duchess&quot; was decommissioned. The ship was sold to Tung Ho Steel for breaking up as scrap on 7 May 1980, and departed Sydney under tow for Taiwan on 9 July.

Following a 2010 reorganisation of RAN battle honours, the destroyer&#x27;s involvement in the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation while in RAN service was recognised with the battle honour &quot;Malaysia 1965–66&quot;.

<doc id="429260" wikidata="Q6542551" url="?curid=429260" title="Library binding">
<text>Library binding can be divided into the two major categories of &quot;original&quot; and &quot;after market&quot;. The original category is as it says: the book was originally bound with the idea that it would be used in a library setting where the book would receive harder use than those usual trade editions sold to the public.

The aftermarket library binding is the method of binding serials, and re-binding paperback or hardcover books, for use within libraries. Library binding increases the durability of books, as well as making the materials easier to use.

== Purpose ==
Library binding is a way to increase the life of books and periodicals used in libraries. This is done by sewing the pages in place and by reinforcing the spine for each volume. The goal of library binding is long-term preservation. However, library bound books also benefit library patrons by ensuring that the volume in hand is complete, opened with ease, and easy to photocopy.

In addition, many libraries re-bind damaged books in library bindings regardless of whether they were originally paperback or hardcover.

== Methods and materials ==
Most library binders use a method of bookbinding called &quot;oversewing&quot; to secure the volumes. Oversewing involves cutting or &quot;milling&quot; off the spines of the volumes, creating a block of loose pages. Then the loose sheets are combined into small units or &quot;signatures,&quot; which are secured with overlock stitching. The separate signatures then get sewn together, creating a single book block. Often a piece of linen is glued to the book block spine for further support. The spine of the volume sometimes is &quot;rounded &quot;and &quot;backed&quot; to keep the spine from caving in. But if the paper of the volume is too fragile, or the book block is too thick, the spine is left flat. The book block is placed in a sturdy cover or &quot;case&quot;, with special paper covering the inside covers.

The most common cloth used by library binders to cover the boards of the book is buckram coated with acrylic. Acrylic coatings are generally resistant to water, mold, insects, and ultra-violet light. The buckram used is a 100% cotton, bulky fabric designed to withstand wear and tear. Smaller books may be bound in &quot;c-cloth&quot;, a lighter weight cloth that may or may not have an acrylic coating. The information about the volume (such as title and call number) is hot-stamped onto the spine. Bound serials are typically all bound in the same color of buckram, in order to indicate the relationship of the volumes.

== After market library binders ==
Library binding is done at a commercial library binding company. Sending books to the library binder is a mass production process. The library will gather and set aside their volumes which they want library bound, and then box and ship these books to a library binding company. The binding company handles each volume one at a time, and then places all the items from the shipment back into boxes and sends them back to the library.

* Commercial library binding factories were first established in America and England in the early twentieth century. Since then, there have emerged several prominent library binding companies (including Dague Bookbindery, Ocker &amp; Trapp, or Wert Bookbinders). Although they are commercial enterprises, library binders act as partners to the library world. The operations they perform on books and serials help extend the life of these materials, making them more accessible to library users. The goal should always be to do as little damage to the volume as possible. A volume should not be sent to a commercial library binder if the papers in the volume are brittle, if the volume appears to have value as an artifact, if the item can be repaired or treated in-house, or if the item needs preparatory conservation treatment. 
* Library binders and libraries agree on the conditions of the services provided and the prices charged, and then sign a contract confirming these. The library binder insures against the loss of volumes and corrects any mistakes (such as the wrong color buckram cloth, or the incorrect title stamped on the spine).
* The Library Binding Institute is the main source of information and standards on library binding. In conjunction with the National Information Standards Organization, the Library Binding Institute has published standards of library binding that should be used by all binding companies. These include technical specifications (for the different methods of library binding) and material specifications (for the materials used in library binding).

<doc id="429261" wikidata="Q4826456" url="?curid=429261" title="Automated guideway transit">
<text>An automated guideway transit (AGT) or automated fixed-guideway transit or automatic guideway transit system is a type of fixed guideway transit infrastructure with a riding or suspension track that supports and physically guides one or more driverless vehicles along its length. The vehicles are often rubber tired or steel wheeled, but other traction systems including air cushion, suspended monorail and maglev have been implemented. The guideway provides both physical support, like a road, as well as the guidance. An automated line can be cheaper to run than a conventional line, due to the shorter trains and stations.

AGT covers a wide variety of systems, from limited people mover systems commonly found at airports, to more complex automated train systems like the Vancouver SkyTrain. In the people mover role the term &quot;automated people mover&quot; (APM) is sometimes used, although this distinction is relatively rare because most people movers are automated. Larger systems span a variety of conceptual designs, from subway-like advanced rapid transit (ART) systems to smaller (typically two to six passengers) vehicles known as personal rapid transit (PRT) which offer direct point-to-point travel along a switched network.

==Origins in mass transit==

AGT was originally developed as a means of providing mass transit services aimed at serving rider loads higher than those that could be served by buses or trams, but smaller than those served by conventional subways. Subways were too expensive to build in areas of lower density, such as smaller cities or the suburbs of larger ones, which often suffer the same gridlock problems as larger cities. Buses could be easily introduced in these areas, but did not offer the capacities or speeds that made them an attractive alternative to car ownership. Cars drive directly from origin to destination, while buses generally work on a hub-and-spoke model that can increase trip times.

AGT offered a solution that fit between these extremes. Much of the cost of a subway system is due to the large vehicle sizes, which demand large tunnels, large stations and considerable infrastructure throughout the system. The large vehicles are a side-effect of the need to have considerable space between the vehicles, known as &quot;headway&quot;, for safety reasons due to the limited sightlines in tunnels. Given large headways and limited average speed due to stops, the only way to increase passenger capacity is to increase the size of the vehicle. Capital costs can be reduced by elevating the tracks instead of burying them, but the large tracks needed present a major visual barrier, and the steel-wheels-on-steel-rails are very noisy rounding bends.

Headway can be reduced via automation, a technique that was becoming feasible in the 1960s. As the headway is decreased, the size of vehicle needed to transport a given number of passengers per hour also decreases, which, in turn, decreases the infrastructure needed to support these smaller vehicles. Everything from track supports to station size can be reduced, with similar reductions in capital costs. Additionally, the lighter vehicles allow for a wider variety of suspension methods, from conventional steel wheels, to rubber tires, air cushion vehicles and maglevs. Since the system has to be automated in order to reduce the headways enough to be worthwhile, by automating the steering as well the operational costs can also be reduced compared to crewed vehicles.

One key problem in an automated system is the steering system&#x27;s negotiation of turns in the right-of-way. The simplest solution is to use a rigid guideway, like conventional rails or steel rollercoasters. For lighter AGTs, these solutions were over-specified given the size of the vehicle, so the guideway was often separate from the running surface. Typical solutions used a single light rail embedded in the ground or attached to the guideway wall, with a wheel or slider that was pressed against the guideway rail and steered the running wheels through a linkage. A suspension-like system is needed to smooth out the imperfections in the guideway and provide a comfortable ride. More modern systems can eliminate the rail and replace it with a &quot;virtual&quot; one that is read by sensors on the vehicle without the need for any mechanical connection.

AGT systems, and the personal rapid transit concept (or &quot;dial-a-cab&quot;), became a major area of research after the publication of the HUD reports in 1968, and subsequent funding by the US Department of Transportation. Political support was particularity strong in states with large concentrations of aerospace companies; with the ending of Project Apollo and the winding down of the Vietnam War, there was concern that these companies would be left with few projects in the 1970s and 80s. Expecting widespread deployment of PRT systems through the late 1970s and 80s, many of the major US aerospace companies entered the AGT market, including Boeing, LTV and Rohr. Car companies followed suit, including General Motors and Ford. This, in turn, sparked off a wave of similar developments around the world.

However, the market for these systems proved to be overestimated, and only one of these US-designed small AGT&#x27;s was constructed as a mass transit system, the Morgantown PRT.

==Small systems==

Small scaled AGT systems are also known as people movers. Although the mass transit world showed a lack of interest, AGT systems quickly found a number of niche roles that they have continued to fill to this day. Tampa International Airport was the world&#x27;s first to incorporate an AGT system as an inter-terminal connector in 1971. Its landside/airside set up allows the airport to increase capacity without spreading out. The LTV Airtrans was another early AGT systems which was installed at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and went into operation in January 1975 (later replaced by the DFW Skylink system in 2005). Similar systems followed at airports around the world, and today they are relatively universal at larger airports, often connecting terminals with distant long-term parking lots. Similar systems were also a fixture of a number of amusement parks, notably the Walt Disney World Monorail System and the Toronto Zoo Domain Ride. The Getty Center in Los Angeles uses a unique vertically oriented AGT to bring visitors from a parking lot off Interstate 405 to the Center at the top of a hill in Brentwood; this system places the motor outside the vehicle at the top of the guideway to reduce the weight lifted up the hill and thus improve efficiency. Small AGT systems are also used as circulator or feeder systems within urban centers. The city of Miami installed its Metromover system in 1986 and later extended it by 4.4 miles and added 12 new stations it in 1994. Similar INNOVIA APM 100 systems operate in Singapore&#x27;s Bukit Panjang district and in Guangzhou, China.

Over time, the aerospace firms that had initially designed most of these systems left the industry and sold off the AGT divisions to other companies. Most of these were picked up by existing transportation conglomerates, and through additional mergers and buyouts, many of these are today owned by either Siemens or Bombardier. During the same period, a number of new companies entered the field with systems designed solely for these smaller installations. Poma, Doppelmayr and the Leitner Group, better known for their ski lift systems, provide AGT systems for the airport market.

==Large systems==

Although the smaller vehicle systems were not successful in the marketplace, larger AGT were simpler to integrate into existing mass transit systems. Many higher capacity AGT systems that looked and operated in a fashion similar to a small subway have since become a common fixture of many existing metro systems, often as a way to serve outlying areas or as feeders to a metro system. Kobe&#x27;s Port Liner is the world&#x27;s first mass transit AGT, which began operating in 1981. It connects Kobe&#x27;s main rail station, Sannomiya Station, with the dockyard areas and Kobe Airport to the south. Many similar systems have been built elsewhere in Japan. The &quot;Véhicule Automatique Léger&quot; (VAL) system in Lille, France, opened in 1983, is often cited as the first AGT installed to serve an existing urban area. Larger scale INNOVIA advanced rapid transit (ART) systems in Toronto, and Vancouver followed in the next few years, and then the Docklands Light Railway in London. VAL and ART systems have seen continued installations around the world such as in Airport Express in Beijing and have been joined by a variety of new systems with similar features, like the AnsaldoBreda Driverless Metro. Automated monorail systems, such as the Innovia Monorail 200 system in Las Vegas, are becoming more common AGT systems. Monorails are less obtrusive because they only require a single, narrow guidebeam.

==AGT renaissance==
Once limited to larger airports and a small number of metro systems, AGT have undergone something of a renaissance since the late 1990s. Lower capital costs compared to conventional metros have allowed AGT systems to expand quickly, and many of these &quot;small&quot; systems now rival their larger counterparts in any measure. For instance, the Vancouver SkyTrain started operations in 1986, but has expanded so rapidly that its track length roughly matches the Toronto subway which pre-dates it by 30 years.

Although the original introduction of PRT systems did not result in the widespread adoption as expected, Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit in West Virginia&#x27;s success, along with a renewed interest in new forms of transit, has led to several new PRT projects since 2000. London Heathrow Airport has installed a PRT system, known as ULTra, to connect Terminal 5 with the long-term carpark; its full operation began in September 2011.

<text>HMAS &quot;Lachlan&quot; (K364/F364) (later HMNZS &quot;Lachlan&quot; (F364)) was a that served the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) from 1945 to 1949. The vessel was later transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy serving as surveyor until 1975 and was eventually scrapped in 1993.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Lachlan&quot; was laid down by Mort&#x27;s Dock &amp; Engineering Company, Sydney on 22 March 1943 and launched on 25 March 1944 by Sarah McNamara Scullin, wife of former Australian Prime Minister James Scullin, and commissioned on 14 February 1945. It was named after the Lachlan River in New South Wales

==Operational history==
===Australian service===
During 1945, &quot;Lachlan&quot; was used during the opening of the Captain Cook Graving Dock; her bow was used to cut the ribbon across the drydock&#x27;s mouth. In 1949, shortly before her decommissioning, she found the wreck of the SS Yongala, which sank with all 122 aboard in a cyclone in 1911. Her wreck was thought to be a shoal at that time. 

&quot;Lachlan&quot; was paid off on 31 May 1949. She was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy, renamed HMNZS &quot;Lachlan&quot;, and was a survey and Antarctic supply ship until February 1975. She was used as a &quot;Refit Barge&quot; with many workshops onboard until the late 1980s when she was sold to Chile to continue work as floating workshops for ships being refitted.

===New Zealand Service===

In 1948, the New Zealand government sought a survey ship to use temporarily until a new one could be built in Britain. After negotiations, &quot;Lachlan&quot; was offered on loan for an initial time of three years and on 31 May 1949 was paid off from RAN service and was immediately given to the Royal New Zealand Navy the next day. Following trials through September 1949, on 5 October 1949 HMNZS &quot;Lachlan&quot; was commissioned into the Royal New Zealand Navy.

The ship was fully disarmed at the dockyard at HMNZS &quot;Philomel&quot; and the ship&#x27;s chart room enlarged for surveying. The ship was rushed into service so quickly that some of the finishing touches were done at sea. Her first survey was started on 18 November 1949 surveying the Wellington Harbour entrance, taking three weeks to complete with assistance of a survey motor boat from Australia. To assist with the creation of the hydrographic service, on earlier voyages part of the ships company included personnel from the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Navy.

HMNZS &quot;Lachlan&quot; surveyed over fifty percent of New Zealand&#x27;s coastline over her twenty years in commission. Some of her service included surveys in Australia and the rest of the Pacific, and she helped clear mines around the Gilbert &amp; Ellice Islands from World War II. Her bow was damaged in a collision with the Napier wharf in October 1954. In 1963 the New Zealand government purchased the vessel for £16,000. By 1970, she was due to be decommissioned but in May 1970 the Royal New Zealand Navy was ordered by the government by an extra five years.

In 1975, HMNZS &quot;Lachlan&quot; was painted all grey and docked at HMNZS &quot;Philomel&quot; to house ship&#x27;s companies whose frigates were undergoing refits. In September 1975, her engines were removed and sold, and in 1993 the hulk was sold to a Philippines company for scrapping.

<text>HMAS &quot;Macquarie&quot; (K532/F532) was a constructed during World War II which served in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Construction==
&quot;Macquarie&quot; was laid down by Mort&#x27;s Dock &amp; Engineering Company, Sydney, launched on 3 March 1945 and commissioned on 7 December 1945.

&quot;Macquarie&quot; was one of eight River-class frigates constructed in Australia for service in the RAN. She was named after the Macquarie River in New South Wales. Although constructed as part of the Australian wartime shipbuilding program, &quot;Macquarie&quot; did not enter service until after the end of World War II.

==Operational history==
Following working up trials, &quot;Macquarie&quot; sailed from Sydney to New Guinea on 31 January 1946, to commence a three-month deployment. During this deployment she was involved in the salvage of Japanese tanker &quot;Naruto&quot;. She returned to Sydney in April, but sailed in June to Indonesia, where she was involved in war crimes trials and grave registration. On her return to Australia in October, she was decommissioned into reserve, on 19 December 1946.

&quot;Macquarie&quot; was recommissioned on 15 August 1952. Her first deployment was in support of the first British atomic test, Operation Hurricane.

&quot;Macquarie&quot; was paid off for a second time on 17 March 1954. She was sold for scrap on 5 July 1962.

<doc id="429272" wikidata="Q654159" url="?curid=429272" title="Chicken tikka masala">
<text>Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chopped chicken (chicken tikka) in a spiced sauce (masala). The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. The origins of the dish are debated, with many believing it was created by South Asian cooks in Britain. It is offered at restaurants around the world and is similar to butter chicken.

==Composition==

Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yoghurt that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy sauce. A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken. The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as purée), cream, coconut cream and a masala spice mix. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato purée or with food dye.

Chicken tikka masala is similar to butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance.

==Origins==
The origin of the dish is not certain, but many sources attribute it to the South Asian community in Great Britain.

Chicken tikka masala may derive from butter chicken, a popular dish in the northern Indian subcontinent. The &quot;Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics&quot; credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant chefs in Britain in the 1960s. They developed and served a number of new inauthentic &quot;Indian&quot; dishes, including chicken tikka masala. 

Historians of ethnic food Peter and Colleen Grove discuss multiple claims regarding the origin of chicken tikka masala, concluding that the dish &quot;was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a Bangladeshi chef.&quot; They suggest that &quot;the shape of things to come may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh’s &quot;Indian Cookery&quot; published in 1961.&quot;

Another claim is that it originated in a restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland. This version recounts how a British Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, proprietor of a restaurant in Glasgow, invented chicken tikka masala by improvising a sauce made from a tin of condensed tomato soup, and spices. Peter Grove challenged any claim that Aslam was the creator of the dish on grounds that the dish was known to exist several years before his restaurant opened. 

Chef Anita Jaisinghani wrote in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; that &quot;the most likely story is that the modern version was created during the early ’70s by an enterprising Indian chef near London&quot; who used Campbell&#x27;s tomato soup. However, restaurant owner Iqbal Wahhab claims that he and Peter Grove fabricated the story of a chef using tomato soup to create chicken tikka masala in order &quot;to entertain journalists&quot;. 

Rahul Verma, a food critic who writes for &quot;The Hindu&quot;, claimed that the dish has its origins in the Punjab region.

==Popularity==
Chicken tikka masala is served in restaurants around the world.

According to a 2012 survey of 2,000 people in Britain, it was the country&#x27;s second-most popular foreign dish to cook, after Chinese stir fry.

In 2001, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook mentioned the dish in a speech acclaiming the benefits of Britain&#x27;s multiculturalism, declaring:

<doc id="429274" wikidata="Q475628" url="?curid=429274" title="Ragnarok Online">
<text>Ragnarok Online (, &quot;Rageunarokeu Onrain&quot; marketed as Ragnarök, and alternatively subtitled The Final Destiny of the Gods) is a massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) created by Gravity based on the manhwa &quot;Ragnarok&quot; by Lee Myung-jin. It was released in South Korea on 31 August 2002 for Microsoft Windows. The game has spawned an animated series, &quot;Ragnarok the Animation&quot;, and a sequel game, &quot;Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the Second&quot;. The player&#x27;s characters exist in a world with a player environment that includes NPC&#x27;s (non-playable characters) that can be interacted with, and creatures spawning in maps that need to be defeated to level-up and to acquire items.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is heavily based around Norse mythology, wherein the characters are taken from the stories around Ragnarök. Player characters interact in a 3D environment but are represented by 2D character sprites for front, back, side and diagonal facings. The major types of server-supported gameplay are Player vs Environment, Guild vs Guild, Player vs Player. Also supported by the game server are Group vs Group, Arena Combat, Player vs Monster, Player vs All, and various other specific scenarios at designated instance locations in the game world. Non-player character-run challenges and contests are also available with prizes, awards, and/or in a specific hall of fame listing.

Players can sign up for quests and submit them for rewards as well as access storage and teleport services for a small fee. Every town will have the usual stores and shops where players can purchase and sell their items. The stores differ from city to city because each city is affiliated with a different job that players can choose from; therefore, the goods each sell are relatively for that particular job that the city is affiliated with. Quests usually provide a unique reward such as learning a new skill or receiving a rare item.

The job system initially consisted of 13 classes, which has increased to over 50 via several updates. Each class specializes in certain skills corresponding to archetypes in a role-playing game. Additionally, numerous equipment are exclusive to particular classes. The greatness of the equipment depends on the character attribute status.

Once a player reaches player level 99 and job level 50, they can &#x27;rebirth&#x27; their character (not applicable to expansion classes and Super Novices). Rebirthing brings a character back to level 1 for both player level and job level. Reborn characters generally work the same as regular characters up until the second class. Instead of a second class, characters that are born can transcend to a new second job, different from those of a character that has not been reborn. These transcended job types have more skills and a larger number of &#x27;stat points&#x27; to allocate to characters compared to second classes. The experience curve for transcendent jobs is significantly higher. Players are given the option to advance onto their third classes which provide an additional set of skills as well as allowing with player to break through the traditional level cap of 99.

==Setting==
&quot;Ragnarok Online&quot; is divided into a series of maps on two major continents, each of which has its own terrain and native monsters, though many monsters are present in multiple regions. Transportation between maps requires loading the new map and monsters are unable to travel from one map to another unless directly associated with the player such as a pet, mount, or hireling. Areas from Norse mythology are included.

== History ==
The official &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot; servers underwent massive game system changes in 2010, which has been titled &quot;Renewal&quot;, which revamped game mechanics, changed the behavior and interaction of stats, gears, and modifiers in the stat system, changed the way and amount of character experience, and introduced the 3rd Job Classes. There are various other changes that come with &quot;Renewal&quot;, including interface and hotkey alterations, as well as skill changes.

On May 25, 2018 (the date of implementation of European General Data Protection Regulation rules), the servers of &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot; and &quot;Ragnarok Online 2&quot; were shut down in most of Europe, excluding CIS countries. The Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines (MSP) servers of &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot; were shut down on November 28, 2021.

==Reception==

Overall, &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot; has been critically acclaimed and commercially successful, especially in Korea during the mid 2000s.

==Related media==

Gravity partnered with SkyZone Entertainment to release a series of standalone mobile phone games that supplement &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot;. There were 5 games, each one based on one of the 6 original first classes, thus leaving Acolyte excluded. The sole release in the North American market, &quot;Ragnarok: Mobile Mage&quot;, features the playable mage class. Players are given the ability to transfer earned zeny (the in-game currency) to their &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot; game account.

<text>HMAS &quot;Murchison&quot; (K442/F442) was a Modified or of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The ship was laid down in 1943, but not commissioned until after the end of World War II. &quot;Murchison&quot; fought in the Korean War, was decommissioned in 1956, and sold for scrap in 1961.

==Construction==
&quot;Murchison&quot; was one of four Bay-class frigates constructed in Australia during World War II, being laid down by Evans Deakin &amp; Company, Brisbane on 3 June 1943. She was launched on 31 October 1944, and commissioned on 17 December 1945. She was named for the Murchison River in Western Australia.

==Operational history==
Completed too late in the war to take part in the fighting, &quot;Murchison&quot; began her career by visiting Morotai, Ternate, and the Celebes for surveillance duties and War Graves Commission tasks, before sailing to Japan and joining the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The frigate returned to Australia in May 1946.

&quot;Murchison&quot; later saw extensive operational service during the Korean War and was involved in the Naval Battle of Han River on 28–30 September 1951, during which she was heavily engaged by Chinese shore installations while conducting riverine operations. Four sailors were wounded in the encounter, while &quot;Murchison&quot; destroyed a number of Chinese gun positions. The frigate was awarded the battle honour &quot;Korea 1951–52&quot; for her actions during the war.

On 3 October 1952, &quot;Murchison&quot; was present of the Montebello Islands for the Operation Hurricane nuclear weapons test.

==Fate==
&quot;Murchison&quot; paid off on 31 January 1956 and she was sold for scrap on 21 September 1961.

<doc id="429276" wikidata="Q689950" url="?curid=429276" title="Naan">
<text>Naan () is a leavened, oven-baked or tawa-fried flatbread, that can also be baked in a tandoor. It is characterized by a light and fluffy texture and golden-brown spots from the baking process. Naan is found in the cuisines of Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. 

Composed of white or wheat flour and combined with a leavening agent, typically yeast, naan dough develops air pockets that contribute to its fluffy and soft texture. Additional ingredients for crafting naan include warm water, salt, ghee and yogurt, with optional additions like milk, egg, or honey. Baking powder or baking soda can be used instead of yeast to reduce the preparation time for the bread.

In the baking process using a tandoor, naan dough is rolled into balls, flattened and pressed against the inner walls, which can reach temperatures up to 480 °C (900 °F). This method allows the bread to be baked within minutes, achieving a spotty browning due to intense heat. Naan can be prepared on a stovetop using a tava. The pan may be flipped upside down over the flame to achieve browning on the bread&#x27;s surface.

Once baked, naan is coated with ghee or butter and served warm. This soft and pliable bread accompanies meals, replacing utensils for scooping up sauces, stews, and curries, or with dryer dishes like tandoori chicken.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;naan&quot; comes from Persian &quot;nân&quot; (), a generic word for any kind of bread. 

The earliest known English use of the term occurs in an 1803 travelogue written by William Tooke. While Tooke and other early sources spelled it &quot;nan&quot;, the spelling &quot;naan&quot; has become predominant since the 1970s.

==Varieties==

===Indian subcontinent===
Naan spread to the Indian subcontinent during the Islamic Delhi Sultanate period. The earliest mention of naan in the region comes from the memoirs of Indo-Persian Sufi poet Amir Khusrau living in India during the 1300s AD. Khusrau mentions two kinds of naan eaten by Muslim nobles; Naan-e-Tunuk and Naan-e-Tanuri. Naan-e-Tunuk was a light or thin bread, while Naan-e-Tanuri was a heavy bread and was baked in the tandoor. During India’s Mughal era in the 1520s, naan was a delicacy that only nobles and royal families enjoyed because of the lengthy process of making leavened bread and because the art of making naan was a revered skill known by few. The Ain-i-Akbari, a record of the third Mughal emperor’s reign, refers to naan being eaten with kebabs or kheema in it. By the 1700s, naan had reached the masses in Mughal cultural centers in South Asia.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, naan is a popular alternative to rice among the Indians, Arabs, Malays, Acehnese and the Minangkabaus, similar though not the same as roti or roti canai which was introduced from Tamils. This dish is known as roti naan or roti nan, and is cooked using Indonesian spices such as garlic.

===Myanmar===
&quot;Naan bya&quot; () in Myanmar is traditionally served at teahouses with tea or coffee as a breakfast item. It is round, soft, and blistered, often buttered, or with creamy (boiled chickpeas) cooked with onions spread on top, or dipped with Burmese curry.

===China===
The Jingzhou style of guokui, a flatbread prepared inside a cylindrical charcoal oven much like a tandoor, has been described as &quot;Chinese naan&quot;. It is also an integral part of Uyghur cuisine and is known in Chinese as 饢 (&quot;náng&quot;).

===Japan===
After being promoted by Kandagawa Sekizai Shoukou in 1968, which is now the sole domestic manufacturer of tandoors, naan is now widely available in Indian-style curry restaurants in Japan, where naan is typically free-flow. Some restaurants bake ingredients such as cheese, garlic, onions, and potatoes into the naan, or cover it with toppings like a pizza.

=== Georgia ===
Shotis puri is a popular flat bread eaten in Georgia and cooked by sticking dough to the sides of a tandoor-like clay oven called a &quot;tone&quot;. 

===Elsewhere===
In 1799, the word naan was introduced into the English language by historian and clergyman William Tooke. Today, naan can be found worldwide in restaurants serving South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine, and it is available in many supermarkets. Fusion cuisine has introduced new dishes that incorporate naan, including naan pizza and naan tacos and even huevos rancheros (an egg dish) served over naan. Naan pizza is a type of pizza where naan is used as the crust instead of the traditional pizza dough. Chefs such as Nigella Lawson, and supermarkets such as Wegmans offer recipes for people to make their own naan pizza at home, though it is certainly not traditional.

<text>Roti (also known as chapati) is a round flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is commonly consumed in many South Asian, Southeast Asian, Caribbean, and Southeast African countries.

It is made from stoneground whole-wheat flour, traditionally known as &quot;gehu ka atta&quot;, combined into a dough with added water. Its defining characteristic is that it is unleavened. &quot;Naan&quot; from the Indian subcontinent, by contrast, is a yeast-leavened bread, as is &quot;kulcha&quot;. Like breads around the world, roti is a staple accompaniment to other foods.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;roti&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;roṭikā&quot;, meaning &quot;bread&quot;.

== Types ==
# &quot;Makki roti&quot;: corn flour roti served with sarson ka saag, a classic dish of Punjab.
# Akki roti: Rice flour roti with grated vegetables and spices, served with chutney, a famous dish of Karnataka.
# Thalipeeth roti: Maharashtrian roti is made with bajra, jowar, rice, chickpea, and spices, served with yogurt or ghee, also popular in Karnataka.
# Missi roti: Rajasthani roti similar to chapati with added spices like red chili, cumin, and turmeric, served with gravy or vegetables.
# Kuttu roti: Buckwheat flour roti with potatoes, gluten-free and common during Navratri fasting.
# Paratha: Wheat flour roti, plain or stuffed with various vegetables like potatoes, cauliflower, or paneer, served with butter, curd, or alone.
# Rumali roti: Thin, soft roti foldable like a handkerchief, popular in Awadhi, Mughlai, and Hyderabadi cuisine, best served with gravy.
# Gur roti: Jaggery and whole wheat flour roti, small and thick, also known as meethi roti.

== Preparation ==
Roti is made from a mixture of flour, water, and optionally salt and butter or oil. They are mixed together to create a dough which is left to rest. The dough is then divided into balls which are flattened with a rolling pin to form rotis. The rotis are then cooked on a tava or pan.

==Variants==
===Indian subcontinent===

Many variations of flatbreads and roti are found in many cultures across the globe, from the Indian subcontinent to Africa to Oceania to the Malay Peninsula to the Americas. The roti is a traditional flatbread from the Indian subcontinent. It is normally eaten with cooked vegetables or curries; it can be used as a carrier for them. It is made most often from wheat flour, cooked on a flat or slightly concave iron griddle called a &quot;tawa&quot;. Traditionally, rotis have also been made from the flour of millet, maize, jowar, bajra, and even rice. Tandoori roti is cooked by sticking the flattened dough to the inside wall of a tandoor oven, where it bakes quickly at a high temperature. Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour known as atta, mixed into a dough with water, edible oil and optional salt in a mixing utensil called a &quot;parat&quot;, and is cooked on a &quot;tava&quot; (flat skillet). It is known as &quot;phulka&quot; in Punjabi and Saraiki, and &quot;maani&quot; in Sindhi.

====Sri Lanka====
In Sri Lanka, there is a variant of roti called &quot;pol roti&quot; (coconut roti), made of wheat flour, and/or kurakkan flour, and scraped coconut. Sometimes, chopped green chilis and onion are added to the mixture before cooking. These are usually thicker and harder than other roti types. They are usually eaten with curries, or some types of &quot;sambol&quot; or &quot;lunu miris&quot; and considered a main meal rather than a supplement.

Another variety of roti popular in Sri Lanka is &quot;kottu roti&quot;, which is made up of &quot;paratha &quot;or &quot;godamba roti&quot;, These are cut into small pieces, small in size and rectangular or square in shape. Then on a square heating pan, vegetables and onions are fried. Eggs, cooked meat, or fish are added to fried vegetables and heated for a few minutes. Finally, the pieces of cut &quot;paratha&quot; are added. These are chopped and mixed by repeated pounding using heavy iron blades/spatula, the sound of which can be heard from a long distance. Depending upon what ingredients are used, the variations are vegetable, egg, chicken, beef, mutton, and fish &quot;kottu roti&quot;. It is sometimes prepared and served as a fast food dish.

&quot;Godamba roti&quot; is another variety found in Sri Lanka. Plain&quot; godamba roti&quot; is eaten with curry or it can also be wrapped around a savory filling.

===Caribbean===
Roti is eaten widely across the Caribbean, especially in countries with large Indo-Caribbean populations such as Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, and Jamaica. Originally brought to the islands by indentured laborers from the Indian subcontinent, roti has become a popular staple in the culturally rich cuisines of these countries. In the Caribbean, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break the roti by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the Caribbean, the term roti may refer to both the flatbread (roti) itself and the more popular street food item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling in the form of a wrap.

The roti wrap is the commercialization of roti and curry together as a fast-food or street-food item in the Caribbean. This wrap form of roti originated in southern Trinidad. It was first created in the mid-1940s by Sackina Karamath, who later founded Hummingbird Roti Shop in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago. The wrap was convenient, as the meal could be eaten faster and while on the go, as well as keeping one&#x27;s hands from getting dirty. In Trinidad and Tobago, various wrapped roti are served, including chicken, conch, goat, beef, and shrimp. Vegetables can also be added including potato, pumpkin, and spinach as well a variety of local condiments, with pepper sauce (hot sauce) and mango chutney being the most popular. The roti wrap quickly gained popularity across the island and spread throughout the rest of the Caribbean. The wrap is now simply referred to as a roti or just roti. The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flatbread itself (roti) that surrounds the filling as a &quot;roti skin&quot; or &quot;roti shell&quot;, a practice that is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies. Various types of roti are eaten throughout the West Indies. They are most prominently featured in the diets of people in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Caribbean-style roti is primarily made from wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and water, and cooked on a &quot;tawa&quot;. Certain rotis are also made with ghee or butter.

====Trinidad and Tobago====
====Guyana====
&quot;Dosti roti&quot; is common in Guyana. A small amount of fat is placed in each piece of dough before it is rolled out to make the roti softer. Usually, vegetable oil is used, but butter, or margarine can also be used. Ghee is not used in everyday cooking, but is used on special occasions, especially amongst Hindus. The roti is usually clapped by hand or beaten a bit, hot off the &quot;tava&quot;, so it softens but does not break.
* A good roti in Guyana is very soft, with layers (almost like pastry layers if possible), which remains whole.
* The type of roti is determined by what is placed in the dough before it is rolled out. Various types include &quot;dhalpuri, aloo&quot; (potato) roti, and even sugar (to keep the kids busy, while the mother finishes cooking).
* In Guyana, a rolled-out, thin, flat dough like a roti that is deep-fried in ghee is called a &quot;puri&quot;. Therefore, a &quot;dhalpuri&quot; is not really a puri.
* Another item prepared like roti is bake or bakes or floats. A Guyanese or Trinidadian fry bake seems to be more similar to an Indian puri. A bake is made with butter or margarine and has a different ratio of flour to fat. It is made much quicker than roti and is usually made in the mornings. Dough is rolled out and cut into shapes or rolled into small rounds. Guyanese bakes are fried, but bakes from other parts of the West Indies can be baked in an oven. Bakes are usually paired with a quick fry-up for breakfast or dinner, stewed saltfish, or eggs (&quot;western&quot; style, with onions, tomatoes, green peppers). Bakes are also made in other parts of the West Indies, including Trinidad, Barbados, and St. Vincent. In Trinidad and Tobago, a &quot;bake and shark&quot; is a popular street-food sandwich in which fried shark is placed between two halves of a sliced bake with local condiments. Pepper sauce, &quot;shado beni&quot;, garlic sauce, tamarind, and mango chutney are most common, as well as lettuce, tomato, and cucumber for fillers.

====Suriname====
In Suriname, roti refers mainly to &quot;dhalpuri&quot; or &quot;aloo puri&quot;. It is most often eaten with curried chicken. As in Trinidad and the West Indies, roti can also refer to the stuffed roti wrap. This dish is usually eaten out of hand. Due to a mass emigration of Indian Surinamese in the 1970s, roti became a popular take-out dish in the Netherlands. It usually includes chicken curry, potatoes, a boiled egg, and various vegetables, most notably the &quot;kousenband&quot; or yardlong bean. Another variation includes shrimp and aubergine. The meat with gravy, potatoes, egg, and yardlong beans are served side by side on a plate, with the &quot;aloo puri&quot; folded in fours on top. 

===Southeast Asia===
In Indonesia and Malaysia, the term encompasses all forms of bread, including Western-style bread, as well as the traditional Indian breads.

In Thailand, โรตี is a popular street food that can be eaten as a dessert or as a side dish. Some Thai curries can also be accompanied with a side of roti, primarily Southern Thai curries.

In Cambodia, រ៉ូទី is a dessert that is sold as street food. It is similar to both a crêpe and paratha.

===South Africa===
Roti was initially introduced to South Africa by Indian migrants during the 19th century, and subsequently became incorporated into Durban cuisine. It is widely eaten by the Indian communities living in South Africa, and is either eaten as a flat bread or a wrap with locally made curries.

Roti is also often eaten in Cape Coloured and Cape Malay Communities. Two types of roti are eaten: chapati/flat roti and paratha/flaky roti. Flaky roti is also called Malay roti. When eaten with a curry filling, usually mutton, chicken or mince, the roti is called a Salomie. 
A roti gatsby is a popular takeaway dish where the bread of the filled gatsby, a popular sandwich is replaced several rotis and folded.

===Mauritius===
Similarly as with other countries that were part of the Indian diaspora, roti was introduced to Mauritius by Indian migrants/indentured labourers during the 19th century, and has since been a staple of Mauritian cuisine and a common street food. Roti generally refers to &quot;farata&quot; (a local pronunciation of paratha), a pancake made of wheat flour and water; other variants include &quot;dholl puri&quot;, which is layered, and stuffed with boiled and ground dal/split peas, and &quot;ti puri&quot;, a smaller roti that is fried and usually served with seven different curries.

===Iran===
In Iran, the two variants of roti are called &quot;khaboos&quot; and &quot;lavash&quot;. These two breads (the former of which is almost exactly prepared like Indian roti) are quite similar to other rotis.

===Elsewhere===
Roti shops are now abundant in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Owing to Canada&#x27;s considerable immigrant populations from both South Asia and the Caribbean, roti and its variants are popular there. As Indo-Caribbean people moved to North American cities such as Toronto, New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, and Montreal, they exported with them the wrapped version of roti. A distinct Toronto offering is the &quot;East Indian roti&quot;, a variation on the stuffed roti from the West Indies. In some of these cultures, rotis are also being used in the place of pita bread when making burritos, quesadillas, or any other kinds of wraps.

<text>HMAS &quot;Napier&quot; (G97/D13) was an N-class destroyer serving in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) during World War II. Built during 1939 and 1940, the destroyer was commissioned into the RAN, although she was ordered and owned by the British government. During 1941, &quot;Napier&quot; operated in the Mediterranean, before being transferred to the British Eastern Fleet at the start of 1942, then to south Atlantic operations in early 1944. In 1945, &quot;Napier&quot; was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet, and spent the rest of World War II in the fight against Japan. After the war&#x27;s end, the destroyer was decommissioned and returned to the British. She was sold off in 1955, and broken up in 1956.

==Design and construction==
The N-class destroyer had a displacement of 1,760 tons at standard load, and 2,353 tons at full load. &quot;Napier&quot; was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion was provided by Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons geared steam turbines, which provided 40,000 shaft horsepower to the ship&#x27;s two propellers. &quot;Napier&quot; was capable of reaching . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 226 officers and sailors.

The ship&#x27;s armament consisted of six 4.7-inch QF Mark XII guns in three twin mounts, a single 4-inch QF Mark V gun, a 2-pounder 4-barrel Pom Pom, four 0.5-inch machine guns, four 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns, four .303 Lewis machine guns, two Pentad dual torpedo launcher tube sets (with 8 torpedoes carried), two depth-charge throwers and one depth-charge chute (with 45 charges carried). The 4-inch gun was removed later in &quot;Napier&quot;″s career.

&quot;Napier&quot; was the first of the eight-ship N class laid down under the War Emergency Programme when construction started at the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company shipyard in Govan, Scotland on 26 July 1939. The destroyer was launched on 22 May 1940 by the wife of one of the company directors, and was commissioned into the RAN on 28 November 1940. Although commissioned as an Australian warship, &quot;Napier&quot; remained the property of the Royal Navy. The ship was named after Scottish Admiral Sir Charles Napier, with the ship&#x27;s badge taken from the family coat of arms, and cost 403,960 pounds to build.

==Operating history==
During the ship&#x27;s first weeks of operation, several sailors threatened to mutiny by refusing to leave the mess decks; this was defused when the ship&#x27;s first lieutenant humorously threatened to &quot;flog &#x27;em out of the mess decks with ropes&#x27; ends&quot;.

In January 1941, &quot;Napier&quot; carried Winston Churchill to the Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow from nearby Scrabster when Churchill accompanied Lord Halifax there for his departure for the United States to serve as British Ambassador.

After completing sea trials, &quot;Napier&quot; spent the first part of her career operating as a convoy escort in the North Atlantic. &quot;Napier&quot; and sister ship were transferred to the Mediterranean, arriving in time to participate in the evacuation of Crete. &quot;Napier&quot; was then assigned to Port Said for months, serving as control ship for the harbour&#x27;s defence at night, while undergoing repairs and refits in the day. On completion in August, the destroyer was assigned as lead ship of the 7th Destroyer Flotilla. During the remainder of the year, &quot;Napier&quot; participated in the Tobruk Ferry Service, escorted convoys through the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, and transferred troops between Cyprus and Hafia.

At the start of 1942, &quot;Napier&quot;, &quot;Nestor&quot;, and were transferred to the British Eastern Fleet. The ships&#x27; first task was to escort the carrier to the Malaya-Java area. In June, &quot;Napier&quot; and &quot;Nestor&quot; returned to the Mediterranean for Operation Vigorous, a major convoy to support besieged Malta. &quot;Napier&quot; returned to duties with the Eastern Fleet after the unsuccessful convoy run, and in September participated in the Madagascar campaign, particularly the surrender of Majunga and the occupation of Tamatave. 

The destroyer commenced patrols of the East Indian Ocean in October, which she continued until March 1943, when she joined the Atlantic anti-submarine force based in South Africa. At the start of 1944, &quot;Napier&quot; was assigned to Indian waters. Later in the year, the ship sailed to Australia for a long period of refitting at Williamstown, but returned to the Eastern Fleet in early November. During December, &quot;Napier&quot; supported operations of the 74th Indian Infantry Brigade. In January 1945, &quot;Napier&quot; took part in landings at Akyab and Ramree.

In early 1945, &quot;Napier&quot; was reassigned to the British Pacific Fleet, changing her pennant from G97 to D13. During May, the destroyer was part of the escort screen for the carrier air raids on Sakishima. &quot;Napier&quot; was present in Tokyo Bay on Victory over Japan Day (2 September 1945), when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. After supporting the occupation landings, the destroyer sailed to Sydney.

&quot;Napier&quot; earned six battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Crete 1941&quot;, &quot;Libya 1941&quot;, &quot;Indian Ocean 1942–44&quot;, &quot;Burma 1944–45&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1945&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
The Australian ship&#x27;s company left on 25 October 1945, and &quot;Napier&quot; was returned to the RN. The ship was not recommissioned, and was sold to Thos. W. Ward for scrap in 1955. She arrived at Briton Ferry in January 1956 for breaking.

<text>HMAS &quot;Nepal&quot; (G25/D14) was an N-class destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Launched in 1941 as &quot;Norseman&quot;, the ship suffered significant damage during an air raid on the John I. Thornycroft and Company shipyard, and during repairs was renamed to recognise Nepal&#x27;s contribution to the British war effort. Although commissioned into the RAN in 1942, the ship remained the property of the Royal Navy.

Most of &quot;Nepal&quot;″s wartime service was as part of the British Eastern Fleet, operating in the Indian Ocean. The destroyer was involved in Madagascar campaign in 1942, and the Cockpit and Transom air raids in 1944. In early 1945, &quot;Nepal&quot; was reassigned to the British Pacific Fleet, and operated with them for the rest of the war.

On her return to Sydney in October 1945, &quot;Nepal&quot; was decommissioned and returned to the Royal Navy who recommissioned her as HMS &quot;Nepal&quot;. She was scrapped in 1956.

==Design and construction==
The N-class destroyer had a displacement of 1,760 tons at standard load, and 2,353 tons at full load. &quot;Nepal&quot; was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion was provided by Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons geared steam turbines, which provided to the ship&#x27;s two propellers. &quot;Nepal&quot; was capable of reaching . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 226 officers and sailors.

The ship&#x27;s armament consisted of six 4.7-inch QF Mark XII guns in three twin mounts, a single 4-inch QF Mark V gun, a 2-pounder 4-barrel Pom Pom, four 0.5-inch machine guns, four 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns, four .303 Lewis machine guns, two Pentad dual torpedo launcher tube sets (with 8 torpedoes carried), two depth-charge throwers and one depth-charge chute (with 45 charges carried). The 4-inch gun was removed later in &quot;Nepal&quot;″s career.
The ship was laid down as &quot;Norseman&quot; by John I. Thornycroft and Company at Woolston, Hampshire on 9 September 1939. She was launched on 4 December 1941. Later in December, an air raid on the shipyard saw &quot;Norseman&quot; take serious damage; a direct hit nearly cut the destroyer in two. The ship was repaired, during which her name was changed to &quot;Nepal&quot;, honouring Nepal&#x27;s contribution to the British war effort. &quot;Nepal&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 11 May 1942: although commissioned as an Australian warship, she remained the property of the Royal Navy. The warship cost £402,939 to build.

==Operational history==
After commissioning, &quot;Nepal&quot; was assigned to the Home Fleet, based at Scapa Flow. During this time, the ship was filmed to represent the fictional HMS &quot;Torrin&quot; for the British war film &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;. In July 1942, the destroyer was reassigned to the British Eastern Fleet, and sailed from Scotland to Kenya. During September, the destroyer was involved in the later parts of the Madagascar campaign. During the rest of 1942, the destroyer operated on convoy escort runs and anti-submarine patrols from Kilindini. In March 1943, &quot;Nepal&quot; sailed to Australia for a two-month refit during April and May.

&quot;Nepal&quot; returned to the Indian Ocean in June 1943, and resumed operations with the Eastern Fleet, this time from Trincomalee. In April 1944, the destroyer was part of the carrier escort screen during Operation Cockpit, then again in May for Operation Transom. In August, the destroyer returned to Australia for refit, then was assigned to escort the aircraft carrier during late November and early December. From 7 December 1944 to 12 February 1945, &quot;Nepal&quot; and sister ship were involved in supporting the 74th Indian Infantry Brigade. During this, on 5 February, &quot;Nepal&quot; damaged one of her propellers when it struck a submerged rock in the Kaleindaung River, but was able to keep operating on one propeller until the end of the deployment.

At the start of March 1945, &quot;Nepal&quot; was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet; her pennant number was changed from G25 to D14. The destroyer remained with the Pacific Fleet until after the end of World War II. &quot;Nepal&quot; earned four battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Indian Ocean 1942–44&quot;, &quot;Burma 1944–45&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1945&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Nepal&quot; arrived in Sydney on 22 October, and was decommissioned and returned to the Royal Navy. She was recommissioned as HMS &quot;Nepal&quot; and sailed back to the UK arriving on 28 December 1945 – some three and a half years after leaving. After repairs and having her armament removed she initially was used as a minesweeper trials ship in the Channel. Subsequently &quot;Nepal&quot; became a sea training vessel attached to , Port Edgar, on The Firth of Forth.

She was reduced to the reserve in early 1951 and was nominated for a Type 15 conversion but no work was carried out before May 1954 when it was cancelled. &quot;Nepal&quot; was passed to the British Iron &amp; Steel Corporation in January 1956 who allocated her to the Briton Ferry yard of Thos. W. Ward for scrapping where she arrived on 16 January.

<text>HMAS &quot;Nestor&quot; (G02) was an N-class destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built in Scotland, &quot;Nestor&quot; was commissioned in February 1941; although manned by Australians and commissioned as an Australian warship, she remained the property of the Royal Navy.

Entering service in 1941, &quot;Nestor&quot; spent most of her career as a patrol and escort vessel in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Far East. In December 1941, the destroyer located and sank the . In June 1942, &quot;Nestor&quot; sailed as part of the Operation Vigorous escort force, protecting a supply convoy to Malta. On the evening of 15 June, the ship was heavily damaged by air attack. Despite attempts to tow the ship to base, &quot;Nestor&quot; was abandoned and scuttled off Crete the next morning. &quot;Nestor&quot; is the only ship of the RAN that never operated in Australian waters.

==Design and construction==
The N-class destroyer had a displacement of 1,773 tons at standard load, and 2,550 tons at full load. &quot;Nestor&quot; was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion was provided by Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons geared steam turbines, which provided to the ship&#x27;s two propellers. &quot;Nestor&quot; was capable of reaching . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 249 officers and sailors at the time she was sunk.

The ship&#x27;s armament consisted of six 4.7-inch QF Mark XII guns in three twin mounts, a single 4-inch QF Mark V gun, a 2-pounder 4-barrel &quot;pom pom&quot;, four 0.5-inch machine guns, four 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns, four .303 Lewis machine guns, two Pentad torpedo launcher tube sets (with 10 torpedoes carried), two depth-charge throwers and one depth-charge chute (with 45 charges carried). The 4-inch gun was removed later in &quot;Nestor&quot;″s career.

&quot;Nestor&quot; was laid down by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Limited, at Govan, Scotland in 1939. She was launched on 9 July 1940 by the daughter of one of the shipyard directors. &quot;Nestor&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 3 February 1941; although manned and commissioned as an Australian warship, the destroyer remained the property of the Royal Navy. The destroyer&#x27;s name came from the mythological ruler. The ship cost 398,960 pounds to build.

==Operational history==
During sea trials, &quot;Nestor&quot; was called on to make several deployments north of the British Isles, in poor conditions. On 14 May, the sailors aboard mutinied in response to the heavy drinking sessions of the ship&#x27;s captain and two other senior officers: they locked themselves in their accommodations and refused to man the ship until the officers were removed. The ship&#x27;s doctor visited the admiral at Scapa Flow (where the ship was based); the admiral sent marines to arrest the three officers, and appointed a new commander to &quot;Nestor&quot;.

After completing sea trials, &quot;Nestor&quot; was assigned to escort and patrol duties in the North Atlantic. During May, she was involved in the pursuit of the , but had diverted to Iceland for fuel when the Allied force encountered and sank the German ship. &quot;Nestor&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean in July, and was involved in the Malta Convoys, then performed escort duties in the South Atlantic before returning to England for refit in October. The destroyer returned to service as a Malta Convoy escort in December. On 15 December, &quot;Nestor&quot; encountered the off Cape St. Vincent; the destroyer successfully hunted down and destroyed the submarine with depth charges.

In January 1942, &quot;Nestor&quot; was reassigned to the Far East. During the voyage, &quot;Nestor&quot; and several sister ships escorted the aircraft carrier during attempts to deliver aircraft to Malaya. After this, &quot;Nestor&quot; joined the British Eastern Fleet, and was based at Colombo. In March 1942, the town of Andover, Hampshire adopted &quot;Nestor&quot; after they raised £214,467 during a Warship Week. In May 1942, the destroyer was assigned back to the Mediterranean.

==Loss==
On 12 June 1942, &quot;Nestor&quot; sailed from Haifa as part of the large escort force for Operation Vigorous, a Malta Convoy consisting of 11 merchant ships carrying food, fuel, and supplies for the besieged island. Air harassment of the convoy began almost immediately after leaving port. During the afternoon of 15 June, the convoy received word that a second convoy (Operation Harpoon) sailing from the west had successfully arrived, and based on the quantity of air attacks and intelligence that an Italian fleet was in the area, it was decided to return the &quot;Vigorous&quot; convoy to Alexandria.
According to one source, at around 18:00, while off Crete, an Italian bomber attacked &quot;Nestor&quot;, killing four sailors and seriously damaging the destroyer&#x27;s engine rooms. Other sources assert the attack was carried out by Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers from Sturzkampfgeschwader 3. began to tow &quot;Nestor&quot;, but by 05:30 on 16 June, the quantity of water taken on by the Australian ship meant that recovery was no longer practical. The ship&#x27;s company transferred to &quot;Javelin&quot;, and &quot;Nestor&quot; was scuttled with depth charges. &quot;Nestor&quot; was the only major RAN ship to never visit Australia.

&quot;Nestor&quot;″s wartime service was recognised with four battle honours: &quot;&quot;Bismarck&quot; 1941&quot;, &quot;Atlantic 1941&quot;, &quot;Malta Convoys 1941–42&quot;, and &quot;Indian Ocean 1942&quot;. The ship&#x27;s bell was recovered, and is on display at the museum at .

<doc id="429283" wikidata="Q1089120" url="?curid=429283" title="Pakistani cuisine">
<text>Pakistani cuisine (, : &quot;pākistānī pakwān&quot;) is a blend of regional cooking styles and flavours from across South, Central and West Asia. The cuisine of Pakistan also maintains certain Mughal influences within its recipes and cooking techniques, particularly the use of dried fruits and nuts. Pakistan&#x27;s ethnic and cultural diversity, diverse climates, geographical environments, and availability of different produce lead to diverse regional cuisines.

Pakistani cuisine, like the culinary traditions of most Muslim-majority nations, adheres to &quot;halal&quot; principles in accordance with Islamic dietary laws, which prohibit the consumption of pork and alcohol, among other restrictions. Additionally, halal regulations outline specific guidelines for meat consumption, including which animals are considered permissible (halal) and the proper methods of slaughter and preparation to ensure compliance with Islamic dietary practices.

Pakistani cuisine is traditionally centered around meat-based dishes. However, the high cost of meat, coupled with widespread poverty, leads many households to substitute meat for more affordable staples such as lentils, rice, and vegetables.

International cuisine and fast food are popular in major cities such as Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, and Karachi, where local and foreign recipes often merge to create fusion dishes, such as Pakistani-Chinese cuisine. Additionally, as a result of lifestyle changes, health trends, and new dietary research being published, traditional ingredients such as masala (pre-mixed and ready-to-use) and ghee (clarified butter)—with its health benefits and high smoke point—have been increasingly popular.

Similar to other Central Asian cultures, families in Pakistan traditionally dine seated on a dastarkhān—a special rug spread out on the floor. To prevent food spills from soiling the rug, it is typically covered with a plastic sheet or disposable mat. After the meal, tea is customarily served, and family members engage in conversations, relaxing against the large cushions or pillows commonly arranged around the dastarkhān for added comfort.

==Historical influences==

Pakistan&#x27;s national cuisine directly inherits from Indo-Aryan, Turko-Persian, Iranic, and Arab, and it is heavily influenced by Muslim culinary practices. Evidence of controlled preparatory cuisine in the region can be traced back to as early as the Bronze Age with the Indus Valley Civilization. Around 3000 BCE, sesame, eggplant, and humped cattle were domesticated in the Indus Valley; spices like turmeric, cardamom, black pepper and mustard were harvested in the region concurrently. For a thousand years, wheat and rice served as basic comestibles in the Indus Valley region.

The arrival of Islam through trade and conquests by various Arab, Turkic, Persian, and Afghan dynasties influenced the local cuisine of the region to a great degree. Due to its Muslim-majority population, Pakistan&#x27;s cuisine sees a strict observance of Islamic dietary laws. Most prominently, forbiddance on the consumption of pork and alcohol by Islamic regulation has shifted the focus of Pakistani cuisine to other types of meat, such as beef, lamb, chicken, and fish, alongside a variety of fruits, vegetables, and dairy.

==Elements==

Pakistani dishes are known for being aromatic. Some dishes contain liberal amounts of oil, contributing to a richer, fuller mouthfeel and flavour. Brown cardamom, green cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, star anise and black pepper are the most commonly used spices in the making of a wide variety of dishes throughout Pakistan. Cumin seeds, chili powder, turmeric, and bay leaves are also very popular. In the Punjab province, spice blends are characterized by their use of coriander powder. Garam masala (a mixture of aromatic spices) is a popular blend of spices used in several Pakistani dishes including Bannu Pulao.

==Regional cuisines==

=== Balochistan ===
Balochi cuisine originates from Pakistan&#x27;s Balochistan region, yet many of its dishes have gained nationwide acclaim. Among the most popular Balochi dishes are Balochi sajji (skewered lamb or chicken stuffed with rice), mutton rosh (mutton chops) and dampukht (meat slow-cooked in its own fats). Influenced by Iranian culinary traditions, Balochi cuisine is known for its aromatic character while being non-spicy.

===Khyber Pakhtunkhwa===

The culinary traditions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are deeply rooted in Pashtun culture and are heavily influenced by Turko-Persian culinary traditions. It is characterized by a preference for rice-based dishes, kebabs, and lamb. Prominent dishes include Kabuli palaw, a flavorful rice dish with meat, carrots, and dried fruits; Bannu Pulao, a beef and stock-based rice dish; Chapli kabab, a spiced and crispy minced meat patty; Tika, marinated and grilled meat skewers; and Mutton Karahi, a savory, rich stew. Local variations such as Peshawari cuisine further showcase the diverse culinary practices of the region. Like Balochi cuisine, Pashtun cuisine is traditionally non-spicy.

==== Kalash ====
Kalashi people have a rich food culture that includes various types of breads and cheese. Some of the widely consumed breads are bilili (walnut bread), jã&#x27;u, (walnut bread), and kurau (flour kindled in crushed grape juice). They are made with flour and different types of nuts. 

===Punjab===
The Punjab province is home to various ethnic groups, resulting in variations in cuisine across the region. Despite these differences, many dishes from Punjab have gained popularity across the region and throughout Pakistan.

Northern Punjab, situated in the Potohar Plateau, is known for dishes such as kunna gosht (mutton slow-cooked in a clay pot), hareesa (a smooth blend of wheat, lentils, and meat), and kofta curry (spiced meatballs in a savory gravy), often enjoyed with soft, sesame-topped roghni naan.

In Central and Eastern Punjab, signature dishes include murgh/beef pulao, a fragrant rice dish cooked with spices and meat; saag, a mustard leaf-based dish traditionally paired with makai roti (maize flour flatbread); paye/kharoray, a slow-cooked stew made from the legs and joints of cow, goat, buffalo, or sheep; murgh cholay, a flavorful curry of chicken and chickpeas often served with roghni naan; and lassi, a refreshing yogurt-based drink. Additionally, dishes such as nihari (a slow-cooked meat stew), haleem (a rich porridge of wheat, lentils, and meat), and karahi gosht (a spicy curry cooked in a wok-like vessel) are staples. The food in this region is traditionally spicy.

==== Saraiki ====
Saraiki cuisine refers to the native cuisine of the Saraiki people from the Saraiki regions of Pakistan, including Southern Punjab, Northern Sindh, and Eastern Balochistan. Saraiki cuisine is known for its flavorful dishes, often incorporating a variety of spices and ingredients. Key dishes include: Sohbat, Corn on the cob (Makai da Sitta), Murgh Cholay, Kunna Gosht, Saraiki Sajji, Cholistani Pulao, and Moringa flowers&#x27; buds curry (locally known as Sohanjrra&#x27;n). The most peculiar and popular desserts include Multani Halwa and Phikka Khoya.

===Sindh===
Sindhi cuisine refers to the traditional culinary practices of the Sindhi people from the Sindh province of Pakistan. Like most Pakistani culinary traditions, it is predominantly meat-based, with chicken and mutton forming the cornerstone of most meals. Signature dishes of the Sindhi people include Karhi, Daal Pakwan, Palo Fish, and Bhugal Gosht. Sindhi cuisine is typically not spicy, focusing on aromatic and balanced flavors. In contrast, the cuisine of Karachi, the capital of Sindh, reflects the influence of its largely Muhajir (Indian immigrant) population, which constitutes about 90% of the city’s residents. Karachi’s food is known for its bold and spicy flavors, with dishes like Biryani becoming signature staples.

===Gilgit-Baltistan===
Gilgit Baltistan is rich in unique food and dishes, each district of Gilgit Baltistan has their cultural dish that symbolizes the people.

Gilgiti cuisine is the cuisine of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is typically non-spicy, but rich in flavors. Prominent Gilgiti dishes, such as the Chapshoro have gained massive popularity among different parts of Pakistan. Mumtu (dumplings) is another popular dish, often served with yogurt and parsley and black pepper, vinegar, chili sauce. 

==== Hunza ====
Staple foods like barley, wheat, and millet form the foundation of dishes such as &quot;chapshuro&quot; and &quot;thukpa&quot;, hearty soups that provide warmth in the cold climate. Fresh fruits like apricots and cherries are transformed into jams, dried fruits, and juices, while dairy products like yogurt and cheese play a significant role in both savory and sweet offerings. Dishes like buckwheat bread, rosehip oil bread, and almond bread are commonly prepared in Hunza.

==== Nagar ====
Chapshuro is the local alternative of pizza in Nagar. Initially a local product of only Nagar valley, now it is widely prepared in Hunza and other localitises on the Karakoram.

==== Ghizer ====
Ghizer is famous for &quot;kelawo&quot; (also spelled &quot;kilao&quot;), walnuts dipped in honey and mulberry juice.

==== Gilgit ====
Dumplings locally called &quot;mumtu&quot; are well known in Gilgit cuisine. As Gilgit itself is a blend of cultures from neighboring districts like Hunza, Ghizer and Chilas, the cuisines of these regions is also widely found here.

==Meal structure==

Pakistanis generally have three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. During the evening, many families have tea with snacks. Unlike some cultures where snacks are commonly consumed between meals, in Pakistan, snacks are typically reserved for &quot;tea time&quot;, which usually takes place in the late afternoon or early evening, after children return from school and adults come home from work. During tea time, families sit together and enjoy tea paired with traditional Pakistani cookies and other bakery items. 

During the holy month of Ramzan (Ramadan), eating patterns change. Muslims observe fasting from dawn until sunset, consuming two meals a day: sehri (or suhur) just before sunrise and iftar at sunset. 

In line with Islamic tradition and cultural practices observed in many Asian traditions, it is customary to eat only with the right hand. This tradition is followed across all meals, whether casual or formal. Furthermore, it is generally considered impolite or inappropriate to have lengthy discussions during a meal, as the focus is meant to remain on eating respectfully and mindfully. Discussions are typically had post-meal, over tea.

===Breakfast===

A typical Pakistani breakfast, locally called &quot;nāshtā&quot; (), consists of eggs (boiled/scrambled/fried/omelette), a slice of loaf bread or roti, parathas, sheermal, tea or lassi, naan or kulcha with chole or qeema (minced meat), fresh seasonal fruits (mangoes, apples, melons, bananas, etc.), milk, honey, butter, jam, shami kebab or nuts. Sometimes breakfast includes baked goods like bakarkhani, rusks and cookies. During holidays and weekends, halwa poori and chickpeas are sometimes eaten. In Punjab, sarson ka saag (mustard leaves) and maakai ki roti (cornbread) are local favourites. Punjabi people also enjoy khatchauri, a savory pastry filled with cheese. In Pakistan, meat dishes are frequently eaten as breakfast, especially on holidays. A traditional Sunday breakfast might be Siri-Payay (the head and feet of lamb or cow) or Nihari () (a dish which is cooked overnight to get the meat extremely tender. The name &quot;Nihari&quot; comes from the Arabic word &quot;Nahar&quot;, meaning &quot;Day&quot; or &quot;Daybreak&quot;.) Many people used to eat &quot;Bong&quot; (Shank curry) in their Sunday brunch.

===Lunch===
A typical Pakistani lunch consists of meat curry or shorba (depending on the region) along with a carbohydrate such as rice or bread. Daal chawal is among the most commonly served dishes at lunch. Breads such as roti or naan are usually served for dinner, but have become more common during the day; rice may be served for dinner as well. Popular lunch dishes may include &quot;aloo gosht&quot; (meat and potato stew) or a vegetable and mutton salan (stew). Chicken dishes like chicken karahi are also popular. Alternatively, roadside food stalls often sell just lentils and tandoori rotis, or masala stews with chapatis. People who live near the main rivers also eat fish for lunch, which is sometimes cooked in the tandoori style.

===Dinner===

Dinner is considered the main meal of the day as the whole family gathers for the occasion. Food which requires more preparation and which is more savoury (such as biryani, nihari, Bannu pulao, kofte, kebabs, qeema, korma) is prepared. Lentils are also a dinnertime staple. These are served with a bread such as roti or naan or rice, along with yogurt, pickle and salad. The dinner may sometimes be followed by fresh fruit, or on festive occasions, traditional desserts like kheer, gulab jamun, shahi tukray, gajraila, qulfi or ras malai.

===Snacks and fast foods===

Typical snacks enjoyed during tea time in Pakistan include a variety of bakery items such as cookies, bakerkhani, cakes, pastries, various halva, and nuts, all paired with a warm cup of tea. 

While tea time holds a special place in Pakistani culture, snacks may also be consumed outside of this context. Often, snacks serve as a quick substitute for a regular meal, such as lunch or dinner, especially when convenience is a priority. These snacks usually comprise food items that are quick to prepare, and usually fried. Some typical snacks are dahi bhala, cutlass (aloo tikki), chaat and samosa chaat, bun kebab, chana masala, chapli kebab, shami kebab, seekh kebab, malai tikka kebab (meat and yogurt), reshami kebab, pakora, and papar. Others include katchauri, samosas (vegetable or beef), bhail puri, daal seu, golgappe, and egg rolls. 

A given snack may be part of a local culture, and its preparation and popularity can vary from place to place. These snacks are often prepared and sold by hawkers on footpaths, bus stations, around bazaars, and other such places, although they may also be served at restaurants. 

==Main courses==

In Pakistan, main courses are usually served with wheat bread (either roti or naan) or rice. Salad is generally taken as a side dish with the main course, rather than as an appetizer beforehand. Assorted fresh fruit or sometimes desserts are consumed at the end of a meal. Meat plays a much more dominant role in Pakistani food, compared to other South Asian cuisines. According to a 2003 report, an average Pakistani consumed three times more meat than an average Indian. Of all the meats, the most popular are goat, lamb and mutton, beef and chicken, which are particularly sought after as the meats of choice for kebab dishes or the classic beef shank dish nihari. Seafood is generally not consumed in large amounts, though it is very popular in the coastal areas of Sindh and the Makran coast of Balochistan and was a dominant element of the cuisine of the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).

Dishes, with or without meat, combined with local vegetables, such as bitter gourd, cauliflower, eggplant, okra, cabbage, potatoes, rutabaga, saag, and chili peppers are most common and cooked for everyday consumption. A typical example is &quot;aloo gosht&quot; (literally &quot;potatoes and meat&quot;), a homestyle recipe consisting of a spiced meat and potato stew, prepared in many households. Korma is a classic dish of Mughlai origin made of either chicken or mutton, typically eaten with naan or other bread, and is very popular in Pakistan.

==Vegetable and legume dishes==

There are plenty of vegetarian-friendly vegetable and legume dishes popular in Pakistan. These are often cooked using traditional spices and flavoring agents such as chilis, turmeric, garlic, ginger, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, and fennel seeds. Dishes such as baingan bartha and sarson da saag are typical examples eaten in most homes. Aloo mutter is made with potatoes and peas.

There are plenty of vegetables which are grown seasonally in Pakistan, which are cooked into curries which are eaten for lunch or dinner. Some vegetable dishes, such as aloo paratha and channa puri, are also consumed for breakfast.

==Meat dishes==
The meat dishes in Pakistan include bovine, ovine, poultry and seafood dishes. Chicken karahi is a famous poultry dish. The meat is usually cut in 3 cm cubes and cooked in a stew. Minced meat is used for kebabs, qeema, and other dishes. Meat dishes may also be cooked with pulses, legumes and rice. In Sindh poultry, beef and mutton meat are also consumed. The camel, rabbit, many birds like Aari (Fulica atra), Kunj (Demoiselle crane), Titar (Grey francolin), Jhirkri (Sparrow), Duck meat is also consumed.

Further important points declare precisely how animals are to be slaughtered; it must be done quickly and with minimal suffering, with the animal&#x27;s awareness of the situation being extremely brief (preferably nonexistent, as stress releases cortisol and adrenaline, potentially spoiling meat quality). The animals must also be healthy as halal principles forbid the consumption of sick, abused, cancerous or otherwise unhealthy animals. Additionally, animals that are killed inadvertently, or during accidents are forbidden, as the intention was not slaughter in those cases.

===Barbecue and kebabs===

Meat and grilled meat have played an important role in Pakistan for centuries. Kebabs are a staple item in Pakistani cuisine today, and one can find countless varieties all over the country. Each region has its own varieties, but some, like seekh kebab, chicken tikka, and shami kebab are especially popular throughout the country and in some other parts of South Asia.

==Pulses==
Various kinds of pulses or legumes make up an important part of Pakistani cuisine. While lentils (called daal) and chickpeas (called channa/chanay ki daal) are popular ingredients in homestyle cooking, they are traditionally considered to be inexpensive food sources. As such, they are typically not served to guests who are invited for dinner or during special occasions. Meat may be combined with lentils and pulses, whether in simple preparations or in elaborate dishes such as haleem.

Beans such as black-eyed peas (lobia) and kidney beans (rajma) are sometimes served in a tomato-based masala sauce, especially in Punjab.

Chickpeas, red kidney beans, and other legumes are also popular in Pakistani cooking. They are usually cooked in a spicy gravy and served with rice or traditional flatbread (roti). Chickpeas, known as channa, are also a common breakfast food when served with puri. Channa chaat is another favorite street food and iftaar dish; it is made of chickpeas, chopped onions, tomatoes, and chillies, and seasoned with spices (chaat masala) and tamarind paste.

A wide variety of lentils is consumed in Pakistan and frequently with rice. Daal chawaal (lentils and rice) is known as a popular comfort food in many Pakistani households.

==Rice dishes==
Pakistan is a major exporter and consumer of rice. Basmati is the most popular type of rice consumed in Pakistan.

Dishes made with rice include many varieties of pulao:

* Bannu Pulao – A classic dish from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, combines beef, spices, and rice. The beef is slow-cooked with bones for a rich, flavorful taste, while the rice is prepared separately with ghee and aromatic spices.
* Chana pulao – Pulao with chickpeas, a very popular vegetarian pulao in Punjab.
* Matar pulao – Pulao made with peas.
* Murgh pulao – Chicken and stock added. Creates a brown rice.
* Yakhni pulao – Meat and stock added. Creates a brown rice.
* Kabuli Palaw – is an Afghan dish, which is popular in Pashtun dominated regions in Pakistan such as the Tribal Areas, FATA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in North-West Pakistan, and Balochistan in the South-West Pakistan. It is a variety of pilaf, consisting of steamed rice mixed with raisins, carrots, and lamb

Biryani is a very popular dish in Pakistan, and has many varieties, such as Lahori and Sindhi biryani. Tahiri, which is a vegetarian form of biryani, is also popular. All of the main dishes (except those made with rice) are eaten alongside bread. To eat, a small fragment of bread is torn off with the right hand and used to scoop and hold small portions of the main dish. Pickles made out of mangoes, carrots, lemon, etc. are also commonly used to further spice up the food.

In the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, feasts using mountains of spiced rice combined with pieces of slowly roasted lamb are often served for guests of honour. These kind of pulaos often contain dried fruit, nuts, and whole spices such as cloves, saffron and cardamom, Bannu pulao are also popular in the province, particularly in the southern region.

==Varieties of bread==
Pakistanis eat breads made of wheat flour as a staple part of their diet. Pakistan has a wide variety of breads, often prepared in a tandoor. The tandoori style of cooking is common throughout rural and urban Pakistan, and also has strong roots in neighboring India, Iran and Afghanistan. Some of these are:

* Chapati – Most common bread made in urban homes, where a tandoor is not available. Chapatis are cooked over a flat or slightly convex dark colored pan known as &#x27;tava&#x27;. Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour and are thin and unleavened. Tortillas are probably the most common analogue to chapatis, though chapatis are slightly thicker. A variant, known as &#x27;romali roti&#x27; (lit. Handkerchief bread), is very thin and very large.
* Makkai ki roti, a yellowish golden colour chapati which is made with pure crushed corns.It is mostly served with traditional winter curry that is called &quot;saag&quot;.
* Kandahari Naan – Long, salty naan originating in Western Pakistan and commonly eaten with Peshawari Karahi or Chapli Kebab.
* Kulcha – This is a type of naan usually eaten with chickpeas and potatoes and mostly popular in urban centers of Punjab.
* Naan – In Urdu, the national language of Pakistan, the word Naan means bread. Unlike chapatis, naans are slightly thicker, typically leavened with yeast and mainly made with white flour. Some varieties like Roghani and Peshwari naan may also be sprinkled with sesame seeds. Naans are seldom, if ever, made at home since they require tandoor-based cooking and require prep work. Numerous varieties of plain, as well as stuffed naans are available throughout Pakistan and each region or city can have its own specialty. Naan is a versatile bread and is eaten with almost anything. For instance, &#x27;saada naan&#x27; or &#x27;plain naan&#x27; is often served with Siri-Payay (cow&#x27;s head and trotters) or Nihari (slow cooked beef stew) for breakfast in many parts of the country.
* Paratha – A flat, layered bread made with ghee or cooking oil and generally cooked on a &#x27;tava&#x27;. However, a &#x27;tandoor&#x27;-based version is also common in rural areas. Parathas are very similar to pastry dough. Parathas most likely originated in the Punjab, where a heavy breakfast of parathas with freshly churned butter and buttermilk was commonly consumed by the farmers to prepare themselves for the hard day of work ahead. However, parathas are now a common breakfast element across the country. Along with the plain layered version, many stuffed versions, such as &#x27;Aloo ka Paratha&#x27; (Potato stuffed paratha), &#x27;Mooli ka Paratha&#x27; (Radish stuffed paratha), and &#x27;Qeemah ka Paratha&#x27; (Ground meat stuffed paratha) are popular.
* Puri – This is a breakfast bread made of white flour and fried. Typically eaten with sweet semolina halwa or gravy (made out of chickpeas and potatoes). Puri is a fairly urban concept, not part of rural cuisine anywhere in Pakistan. However, Halwa Puri has now become a favored weekend or holiday breakfast in urban Pakistan, where it is sometimes sold in shift carts or in specialty breakfast shops.
* Roghani Naan (lit. Buttered Naan) – It is a preferred variety of Naan sprinkled with white sesame seeds and cooked with a small amount of oil.
* Ofrata: Sindhi paratha made with a lot of oil and ghee, a four corner Ofrato is called Chokundo, and three corner Ofrato is called Trikundo.
* Busri: a special Sindhi and Saraiki sweet bread made of two Ofratas, crushed jaggery powder or sugar filled in, cooked with desi ghee and Makhan (butter).
* Bajray ki Roti or Bajhar Mani: pearl millet bread made in rural areas, particularly in Punjab and Sindh in winters. 
* Chawaran ji Mani: rice flour bread made in Sindh, it is common in upper (north) Sindh.
* Roti – This bread is extremely popular all over Pakistan. Tandoori rotis are baked in a tandoor, and are consumed with just about anything. In rural Pakistan, many houses have their own tandoors, while the ones without it use a communal one. In urban Pakistan, bread shops or &quot;nanbai&quot;/&quot;tandoor&quot; shops are fairly common and supply fresh, tandoor baked breads to household customers. 
* Sheermal – Saffron-flavored traditional flatbread. It is a festive bread prepared with milk (&#x27;sheer&#x27;) and butter with added candied fruits. Sheermal is often a vital part of food served in marriages, along with taftan. It is often sweetened.
* Taftan – This is a leavened flour bread with saffron and a small amount of cardamom powder, baked in a tandoor. The taftan made in Pakistan is slightly sweeter and richer than the one made in neighboring Iran.

==Desserts==
Popular desserts include Peshawari ice cream, sheer khurma, qulfi, falooda, kheer, Firni, zarda, shahi tukray and rabri. Sweetmeats are consumed on various festive occasions in Pakistan. Some of the most popular are gulab jamun, barfi, ras malai, kalakand, jalebi and panjiri. Pakistani desserts also include a long list of halva, such as Multani Halwa, hubshee, Gajar ka halwa, sohan halvah, Ugham Halwo, Sindhi Halwo, Seero.

Kheer made of roasted &quot;seviyaan&quot; (vermicelli) instead of rice is popular during Eid ul-Fitr. Gajraila is a sweet made from grated carrots, boiled in milk, sugar, cream and green cardamom, topped with nuts and dried fruit. It is popular in Pakistan, as well as in other parts of South Asia, including Afghanistan.
==Tea varieties==

Pakistanis drink a great deal of tea, locally called &quot;chai&quot;. Both black (with milk) and green teas are popular and there are different varieties common in different parts of Pakistan. 

* In Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral, as well as areas near the Chinese border, salty Tibetan-style butter tea is consumed.
* Doodh pati chai is made by cooking tea leaves with milk and sugar, sometimes served with cardamom for fragrance. Extremely sweet, this is a local variation of a builder&#x27;s tea.
* &quot;Kashmiri chai&quot; or &quot;noon chai&quot;, a pink, milky tea with pistachios and cardamom, is consumed primarily at special occasions, weddings, and during the winter, when it is sold in many kiosks.
* &quot;Sabz chai&quot; or &quot;kahwah&quot;, a green tea often served after every meal in Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the Pashtun belt of Balochistan, served with saffron and nuts. 
* Sulaimani chai is black tea served with lemon.

==Beverages==
Besides tea, there are other drinks that may be included as part of the Pakistani cuisine. All of them are non-alcoholic as the consumption of alcohol is prohibited by Islam. During the 20th century, beverages such as coffee and soft drinks have also become popular in Pakistan. It is very common to have soft drinks nowadays with Pakistani meals.

* Almond sherbet – Sherbet made with almonds 
* Baraf Gola – Frozen Ice in a cup mould served with syrup as a topping
* Kashmiri chai/Gulabi chai – A milky tea known for its pink color, with an either sweet or salty taste
* Lassi – Milk with yogurt, with an either sweet or salty taste
* Lemonade (Limu pani)
* Qehwa – Green tea with cardamom
* Sardai – Mixture of different nuts and kishmish
* Sathu – Famous drink from Punjab
* Sherbet (syrup mixed in water)
* Sherbet-e-Sandal – Drink made with the essence of sandal wood
* Sikanjabeen – Lemonade (mint is also added)
* Sugarcane juice (Ganney ka ras)
* Thadal – A sweet drink from Sindh

==Halal==

Observant Muslims follow the Islamic law that lists foods and drinks that are halal, permissible to consume. The criteria specify both what foods are allowed and how the food must be prepared. The foods addressed are mostly types of meat. 

==Foreign influences==
In addition to the traditional food, fast food is also very popular across the country. In big cities, there are many international fast food restaurants, such as KFC, McDonald&#x27;s, Pizza Hut, Subway, Domino&#x27;s, Burger King, Hardee&#x27;s, Papa John&#x27;s Pizza, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts and Baskin-Robbins. 

Occasionally, people in Pakistan dine out at restaurants with foreign-influenced food, such as Western, Arab and Chinese dishes. There are many westernized, Chinese restaurants and fast food outlets in urban parts of Pakistan. In the Punjab and Sindh provinces, the majority of urban chains of many American, European and British restaurants have opened in many metropolitan cities, such as Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Islamabad-Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Peshawar, Multan, Hyderabad, Quetta, Sargodha, Bahawalpur, Sialkot, Sukkur, Larkana and many others. Marketing and advertisements have attracted Pakistanis to try them out.

Outside Pakistan, Pakistani cuisine is prevalent in countries where there are large Pakistani communities present.

Pakistani food makes use of fresh, hand-pounded masalas. Ghee is used, but the main component of the meal or a dish is meat (beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or fish), and vegetables are sparingly used. Surprisingly, Pakistani food also makes extensive use of olive oil. Sparingly used vegetables does not mean there is no vegetarian food on the menu. Since the cuisine is very similar to Punjabi-style of cooking, tikka, simmered dals, tawa sabzi, and chaat feature here.

<text>HMAS &quot;Nizam&quot; (G38/D15) was an N-class destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The destroyer, named after Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam of Hyderabad, was commissioned into the RAN in 1940, although the ship remained the property of the Royal Navy for her entire career.

&quot;Nizam&quot; spent the early part of her service in the Atlantic, then was reassigned to the Mediterranean, where she was involved in the Crete and Syria-Lebanon Campaigns, the Tobruk Ferry Service, and the Malta Convoys. During 1942, the destroyer was involved in Operation Vigorous and the Madagascar Campaign. The next year saw the ship involved in patrols of the Indian and South Atlantic oceans, searching for German ships and submarines, and rescuing the survivors of U-boat attacks. After returning to Australia for a refit at the end of 1944, ten sailors were washed overboard in February 1945, with none ever seen again. The rest of World War II was spent operating in the Philippines and New Guinea regions.

After returning to Australia in late 1945, &quot;Nizam&quot; was decommissioned and returned to the Royal Navy. The ship was not returned to active service, and was broken up for scrap in 1956.

==Design and construction==
The N-class destroyer had a displacement of 1,773 tons at standard load, and 2,554 tons at full load. &quot;Nizam&quot; was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion was provided by Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons geared steam turbines, which provided 40,000 shaft horsepower to the ship&#x27;s two propellers. &quot;Nizam&quot; was capable of reaching . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 226 officers and sailors.
The ship&#x27;s armament consisted of six 4.7-inch QF Mark XII guns in three twin mounts, a single 4-inch QF Mark V gun, a 2-pounder 4-barrel Pom Pom, four 0.5-inch machine guns, four 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns, four .303 Lewis machine guns, ten 21-inch torpedo tubes in two Pentad mounts, and a complement of depth charges.

HMAS &quot;Nizam&quot; was laid down by John Brown and Company, Limited, at Clydebank in Scotland on 27 July 1939. She was launched by the wife of Sir Holberry Mensforth, a director of John Brown, on 4 July 1940. The ship was commissioned on 19 December 1940; an error in a file at Navy Office caused some sources to incorrectly record the commissioning date as 8 January 1941. Although commissioned into the RAN, the destroyer was on loan from the Royal Navy. HMAS &quot;Nizam&quot; was paid for and named after Sir Osman Ali Khan, The Last Nizam of Hyderabad.

==Operational history==
After completing sea trials, &quot;Nizam&quot; was assigned to Scapa Flow, where she was assigned to fleet duties, then retasked as an escort for convoys crossing the Atlantic. In April 1941, the destroyer joined a convoy sailing to Gibraltar, then sailed around Africa to meet the troop transports &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, which &quot;Nizam&quot; helped escort to Alexandria. Around the same time, all watchkeeping sailors staged a mutiny in response to alterations to watchkeeping and messing arrangements by locking themselves into their messdeck compartments. Following mediation between the sailors and the officers, the captain agreed to restore the original arrangements and decided not to charge the sailors, after which the watchkeepers returned to duty.

On 21 May, &quot;Nizam&quot; participated in the shelling of Scarpanto, then became involved in the Battle of Crete. The destroyer transported commandos from Alexandria to Suda Bay, and returned with wounded. When the campaign turned for the worse, &quot;Nizam&quot; and made two evacuation runs to ferry troops from the island to Alexandria. Following the unsuccessful campaign, &quot;Nizam&quot; was assigned to the Syria-Lebanon Campaign for three weeks, then retasked to the Tobruk Ferry Service, a force of British and Australian warships making supply runs to the Allied forces under siege in Tobruk. &quot;Nizam&quot; made fourteen runs before receiving damage on 14 September; a near-miss from a bomb cracked oil pumps, and the destroyer was towed away from the area by the destroyer , then was able to make temporary repairs and reach Alexandria.

After repairs were completed, &quot;Nizam&quot; spent the rest of 1941 escorting Malta Convoys, on bombardment operations in north Africa, and transporting troops to Cyprus and Haifa. On 21 October 1941 &quot;Nizam&quot; was part of a convoy which came under Stuka dive bomber attack while evacuating Australian infantry Rats of Tobruk to Alexandria. Twenty fully kitted troops were swept overboard during evasion manoeuvres, six being lost at sea and never recovered.

At the start of 1942, &quot;Nizam&quot; and her sister ship, sailed for Singapore to join as escort for the aircraft carrier . In June, the N class ships joined the escort of a large convoy to Malta, during which &quot;Nestor&quot; was sunk by aircraft. &quot;Nizam&quot; and her sisters were assigned to the Madagascar Campaign during September. On 22 September, &quot;Nizam&quot; was assigned to Durban to patrol for Vichy French merchant ships, capturing one and forcing another to scuttle during the week spent in this role. The destroyer then sailed to Simon&#x27;s Town in South Africa for a refit, which lasted until the end of the year.
After refitting, &quot;Nizam&quot; was attached to the British Eastern Fleet, and participated in sweeps of the Indian Ocean for enemy ships. She was then reassigned to the South Atlantic for shipping protection. On 13 July 1943, the destroyer rescued survivors from an American liberty ship sunk by . On 31 July, &quot;Nizam&quot; rescued survivors from a British merchant ship sunk by . After delivering the British survivors ashore, &quot;Nizam&quot; made for Australia, and docked in Melbourne on 18 August for an eight-week refit. The ship returned to operations in the Indian Ocean, and on 17 October was unsuccessfully fired on by a German U-boat. Between late 1943 and early 1944, the destroyer was based in Kenya, then was transferred on 8 March to the Bay of Bengal. During her time based here, &quot;Nizam&quot; participated in Operation Cockpit, a carrier air raid on Japanese assets in south-east Asia. In November, the destroyer sailed to Melbourne for another refit. In a tragedy which harked back to that of 21 October 1941, on 11 February 1945, while crossing the Great Australian Bight in poor weather after the refit, &quot;Nizam&quot; was hit by a freak wave which caused the ship to roll almost eighty degrees to port, and washed ten sailors overboard, none of whom were ever seen again.

During 1945, &quot;Nizam&quot; was assigned to the Philippines and New Guinea theatres as part of the British Pacific Fleet, during which, her pennant number was changed from G38 to D15. On 15 August 1945, &quot;Nizam&quot; received orders to cease hostilities; shortly after this, the ship was attacked by a Japanese fighter, which was shot down. &quot;Nizam&quot; was present in Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender, and served as duty destroyer on 2 September, the day the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. The destroyer left for Australia on 24 September.

&quot;Nizam&quot; earned seven battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Malta Convoys 1941–42&quot;, &quot;Crete 1941&quot;, &quot;Libya 1941&quot;, &quot;Mediterranean 1941&quot;, &quot;Indian Ocean 1942–44&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1943&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Nizam&quot; was decommissioned on 17 October 1945 and returned to the Royal Navy; her ship&#x27;s company transferred to , and the N-class destroyer was temporarily recommissioned as HMS &quot;Nizam&quot; for the voyage to England. The ship was not returned to active service and was passed to the British Iron &amp; Steel Corporation in 1955 who allocated her to Thos. W. Ward for scrapping at their yard in Grays.

<doc id="429286" wikidata="Q644877" url="?curid=429286" title="HMAS Newcastle">
<text>HMAS &quot;Newcastle&quot; (FFG 06), named for the city of Newcastle, New South Wales, the largest provincial city in Australia, was an &quot;Adelaide&quot;-class guided-missile frigate. The last ship of the class to be constructed, &quot;Newcastle&quot; entered service with the Royal Australian Navy in 1993. During her career, the frigate has operated as part of the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce, served in the Persian Gulf, and responded to the 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état. The frigate was decommissioned on 30 June 2019 and transferred to the Chilean Navy on 15 April 2020 and renamed as &quot;Capitán Prat&quot; (FFG 11).

==Design and construction==

Following the cancellation of the Australian light destroyer project in 1973, the British Type 42 destroyer and the American &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigate were identified as alternatives to replace the cancelled light destroyers and the &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers. Although the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class was still at the design stage, the difficulty of fitting the Type 42 with the SM-1 missile, and the success of the &quot;Perth&quot;-class acquisition (a derivative of the American &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class destroyer) compared to equivalent British designs led the Australian government to approve the purchase of two US-built &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates in 1976. A third was ordered in 1977, followed by a fourth, with all four ships integrated into the USN&#x27;s shipbuilding program. A further two ships (including &quot;Newcastle&quot;) were ordered in 1980, and were constructed in Australia.

As designed, &quot;Newcastle&quot; had a full load displacement of 4,100 tons, a length overall of , a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion machinery consists of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, which provide a combined to the single propeller shaft. Top speed is , with a range of at . Two electric auxiliary propulsors are used for close manoeuvring, with a top speed of . Standard ship&#x27;s company is 184, including 15 officers, but excluding the flight crew for the embarked helicopters.

Original armament for the ship consisted of a Mark 13 missile launcher configured to fire RIM-66 Standard and RGM-84 Harpoon missiles, supplemented by an OTO Melara gun and a Vulcan Phalanx point-defence system. As part of the mid-2000s FFG Upgrade Project, an eight-cell Mark 41 Vertical Launch System was fitted, with a payload of RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles. For anti-submarine warfare, two Mark 32 torpedo tube sets are fitted; originally firing the Mark 44 torpedo, the &quot;Adelaide&quot;s later carried the Mark 46, then the MU90 Impact following the FFG Upgrade. Up to six machine guns can be carried for close-in defence, and since 2005, two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts have been installed when needed for Persian Gulf deployments. The sensor suite includes an AN/SPS-49 air search radar, AN/SPS-55 surface search and navigation radar, SPG-60 fire control radar connected to a Mark 92 fire control system, and a Mulloka hull-mounted sonar. Two helicopters can be embarked: either two S-70B Seahawk or one Seahawk and one AS350B Squirrel.

&quot;Newcastle&quot; was laid down by AMECON at Williamstown, Victoria on 21 July 1989, launched on 21 February 1992 and commissioned into the RAN on 11 December 1993. Unlike the first four &quot;Adelaide&quot;-class frigates, &quot;Newcastle&quot; was not constructed in the United States of America, so was never assigned a US Navy hull number. &quot;Newcastle&quot; is the only &quot;Adelaide&quot;-class ship not named after a state capital city. Instead, she is named after Newcastle, New South Wales, the largest regional city in the country. She is the first ship of the RAN to be named &quot;Newcastle&quot;.

==Operational history==

&quot;Newcastle&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 19 December 1999 to 26 January 2000.

During 2005, &quot;Newcastle&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf. &quot;Newcastle&quot; and were the first RAN ships to be fitted with two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts; now a standard theatre fit for all RAN frigates deployed to the Persian Gulf.

At the start of November 2006, &quot;Newcastle&quot; was one of three Australian warships sent to Fiji during the leadup to the 2006 coup d&#x27;état by Fijian military forces against Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. &quot;Newcastle&quot; was the first vessel on station, and was later joined by and . The three vessels were to be used in the event of an evacuation of Australian citizens and nationals. It did not prove necessary to conduct an evacuation and &quot;Newcastle&quot; returned to Australia in late December 2006.

On the morning of 13 March 2009, &quot;Newcastle&quot; was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The frigate was one of the thirteen ships involved in the ceremonial entry through Sydney Heads, and anchored in the harbour for the review.

Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, &quot;Newcastle&quot;″s service was recognised with two honours: &quot;East Timor 1999–2000&quot; and &quot;Persian Gulf 2002–03&quot;. In April 2010, &quot;Newcastle&quot; was presented with the RAN Gloucester Cup, recognising her as the most efficient ship during 2009. During July and August 2010, &quot;Newcastle&quot; was one of three RAN ships to participate in the RIMPAC 2010 multinational exercise.

In mid-2016 &quot;Newcastle&quot; conducted first-of-class flight trials with a ScanEagle unmanned air vehicle (UAV) as part of the development of Navy’s UAV capability. In November that year the frigate sortied from Sydney to intercept a merchant ship off the north coast of New South Wales which was believed to be involved in drug smuggling. In June 2017 it was reported that &quot;Newcastle&quot; had deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Manitou on her sixth deployment to the region.

She was decommissioned on 30 June 2019.

On 27 December 2019, it was announced that &quot;Newcastle&quot; and &quot;Melbourne&quot; would be sold to Chile.

&quot;Newcastle&quot; was renamed and commissioned into the Chilean Navy on 15 April 2020 as &quot;Capitán Prat&quot;, pennant number FFG-11.

==Battle honours==
Up to 1989, battle honours awarded to ships of the Royal Navy could also be inherited by RAN ships carrying the same name. However, upon the announcement that the final &quot;Adelaide&quot;-class frigate would be named for Newcastle, a decision was taken that this policy would end and in future RAN ships would receive their own battle honours, ensuring that &quot;Newcastle&quot;, the first ship in the RAN so named, would not inherit the honours of .

<doc id="429291" wikidata="Q535206" url="?curid=429291" title="Yellow-billed duck">
<text>The yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata) is a 51–58 cm long dabbling duck which is an abundant resident breeder in southern and eastern Africa. This duck is not migratory, but wanders in the dry season to find suitable waters. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms large flocks.

==Description==

These are mallard-sized mainly grey ducks with a darker head and bright yellow bill. The wings are whitish below, and from above show a white-bordered green speculum. Sexes are similar, and juveniles are slightly duller than adults. The north-eastern race is darker and has a brighter bill and blue speculum.

It is a bird of freshwater habitats in fairly open country and feeds by dabbling for plant food mainly in the evening or at night. It nests on the ground in dense vegetation near water. Rarely, it is found in suburban areas, in close proximity to golf courses, parks and lakes or dams. The clutch numbers between six and twelve eggs.

The male has a teal-like whistle, whereas the female has a mallard-like quack.

There are two subspecies of the yellow-billed duck: &quot;A. undulata rueppelli&quot; (northern yellow-billed duck) and &quot;A. undulata undulata&quot; (southern yellow-billed duck). The yellow-billed duck is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. The southern nominate subspecies is declining due to competition and hybridization with feral mallards (Rhymer 2006).

== Biology ==

=== Life Expectancy ===
Male and female yellow-billed ducks have a statistically significant difference in life spans. Male ducks live for 4 years and 4 months on average while female ducks only live for just over 3 years. As such the difference in survival rate is statistically significant as well. 79% of males survive any given year while only 72% of females do. While the juvenile survival rate is highly variable year to year, on average 67% of juveniles survive. Highest mortality for the yellow-billed duck occurs in the summer months with December typically having the highest death rate out of any month of the year closely followed by January.

=== Courtship ===
The male yellow-billed duck performs multiple displays of courtship, similar to many other African ducks. The number of courtship displays the yellow-billed ducks perform is greater than many other African ducks. Ornithologists have noted seven major displays of courtship similar African ducks perform; most species do not perform all seven, however, the yellow-billed duck will engage in all seven forms of courtship. The lack of sexual dichotomy and generally bland plumage may be the driving factor for the elaborate displays of courtship.

=== Molt ===
Like most other waterfowl, yellow-billed ducks undergo a molting process in which they lose all flight feathers at one time leaving them flightless for three to four weeks. This leaves them especially vulnerable to predators and makes foraging difficult. Yellow-billed ducks lose considerable (about a quarter) body mass during the first half of molting, similar to many waterfowl, but are able to regain all that mass by the end of the molt unlike most other African waterfowl which end the molt lighter than beforehand. This suggests that the mobility of partially molted yellow-billed ducks is greater than other waterfowl, allowing them to effectively gather food even before the new flight feathers are fully developed.

== Threats ==

=== Hunting ===
While yellow-billed ducks are protected by the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds Agreement, the species can be hunted as long as lead shot is not used. Hunting seasons for the yellow-billed duck are planned so as not to overlap with the breeding season, which is around July. However, the exact breeding season varies annually based on the climate. Hunting is a major cause of death for the yellow-billed duck with past analysis showing over 25% of duck deaths were due to shooting.

=== Hybridization ===
In the mid-20th century, mallards were introduced to Africa and as the invasive population size has grown, concerns over possible hybridization with the yellow-billed duck have occurred. This fear is fueled by other examples of invasive mallards causing localized extinction of other native ducks around the world because of hybridization.

The fear of possible hybridization between mallards and yellow-billed ducks has been exacerbated by casual observations that suggest possible hybridization of the yellow-billed duck with other native ducks is occurring, however, no genetic tests have been done to shine additional light on these morphological observations to confirm if these individuals are truly hybrids.

Even when genetics have been used, it is still difficult to understand if hybridization is occurring. If hybridization between mallards and yellow-billed ducks is occurring is still debated. Two recent (2019 and 2020) DNA sequencing studies reached opposite conclusions on if hybridization between mallards and yellow-billed ducks is happening. Nevertheless, scientists agree that changes to the gene pool of yellow-billed ducks from possible hybridization, even in the long term, is likely to be negligible. This is because even if mallard and yellow-billed duck hybridization is occurring, introgression is mainly occurring to the mallards’ gene pool, keeping the yellow-billed ducks genetics fairly intact.

<doc id="429296" wikidata="Q1501997" url="?curid=429296" title="Hausdorff distance">
<text>In mathematics, the Hausdorff distance, or Hausdorff metric, also called Pompeiu–Hausdorff distance, measures how far two subsets of a metric space are from each other. It turns the set of non-empty compact subsets of a metric space into a metric space in its own right. It is named after Felix Hausdorff and Dimitrie Pompeiu.

Informally, two sets are close in the Hausdorff distance if every point of either set is close to some point of the other set. The Hausdorff distance is the longest distance someone can be forced to travel by an adversary who chooses a point in one of the two sets, from where they then must travel to the other set. In other words, it is the greatest of all the distances from a point in one set to the closest point in the other set.

This distance was first introduced by Hausdorff in his book &quot;Grundzüge der Mengenlehre&quot;, first published in 1914, although a very close relative appeared in the doctoral thesis of Maurice Fréchet in 1906, in his study of the space of all continuous curves from formula_1.

==Definition==
Let formula_2 be a metric space. For each pair of non-empty subsets formula_3 and formula_4, the Hausdorff distance between formula_5 and formula_6 is defined as

formula_7

where formula_8 represents the supremum operator, formula_9 the infimum operator, and where formula_10 quantifies the distance from a point formula_11 to the subset formula_12.

An equivalent definition is as follows. For each set formula_13 let 
formula_14
which is the set of all points within formula_15 of the set formula_5 (sometimes called the formula_15-fattening of formula_5 or a generalized ball of radius formula_15 around formula_5).
Then, the Hausdorff distance between formula_5 and formula_6 is defined as 
formula_23

Equivalently,
formula_24
where formula_25 is the smallest distance from the point formula_26 to the set formula_5.

===Remark===

It is not true for arbitrary subsets formula_28 that formula_29 implies 
:formula_30

For instance, consider the metric space of the real numbers formula_31 with the usual metric formula_32 induced by the absolute value,

:formula_33

Take

:formula_34

Then formula_35. However formula_36 because formula_37, but formula_38.

But it is true that formula_39 and formula_40 ; in particular it is true if formula_41 are closed.

==Properties==
* In general, formula_42 may be infinite. If both &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are bounded, then formula_42 is guaranteed to be finite.
* formula_44 if and only if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; have the same closure.
* For every point &quot;x&quot; of &quot;M&quot; and any non-empty sets &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; of &quot;M&quot;: &quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) ≤ &quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;) + &quot;d&quot;H(&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;), where &quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) is the distance between the point &quot;x&quot; and the closest point in the set &quot;Y&quot;.
* |diameter(&quot;Y&quot;) − diameter(&quot;X&quot;)| ≤ 2&quot;d&quot;H(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;).
* If the intersection &quot;X&quot; ∩ &quot;Y&quot; has a non-empty interior, then there exists a constant &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0, such that every set &quot;X&quot;′ whose Hausdorff distance from &quot;X&quot; is less than &quot;r&quot; also intersects &quot;Y&quot;.
* On the set of all subsets of &quot;M&quot;, &quot;d&quot;H yields an extended pseudometric.
* On the set &quot;F&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) of all non-empty compact subsets of &quot;M&quot;, &quot;d&quot;H is a metric.
** If &quot;M&quot; is complete, then so is &quot;F&quot;(&quot;M&quot;).
** If &quot;M&quot; is compact, then so is &quot;F&quot;(&quot;M&quot;).
** The topology of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) depends only on the topology of &quot;M&quot;, not on the metric &quot;d&quot;.

==Motivation==
The definition of the Hausdorff distance can be derived by a series of natural extensions of the distance function formula_45 in the underlying metric space &quot;M&quot;, as follows:
* Define a distance function between any point &quot;x&quot; of &quot;M&quot; and any non-empty set &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;M&quot; by formula_46 For example, &quot;d&quot;(1, {3, 6}) = 2 and &quot;d&quot;(7, {3, 6}) = 1.
* Define a (not necessarily symmetric) &quot;distance&quot; function between any two non-empty sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;M&quot; by formula_47 For example, formula_48
* If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are compact, then &quot;d&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) will be finite; &quot;d&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;X&quot;) = 0; and &quot;d&quot; inherits the triangle inequality property from the distance function in &quot;M&quot;. As it stands, &quot;d&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; a metric because &quot;d&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) is not always symmetric, and does not imply that (it does imply that formula_49). For example, , but . However, we can create a metric by defining the Hausdorff distance to be formula_50

==Applications==
In computer vision, the Hausdorff distance can be used to find a given template in an arbitrary target image. The template and image are often pre-processed via an edge detector giving a binary image. Next, each 1 (activated) point in the binary image of the template is treated as a point in a set, the &quot;shape&quot; of the template. Similarly, an area of the binary target image is treated as a set of points. The algorithm then tries to minimize the Hausdorff distance between the template and some area of the target image. The area in the target image with the minimal Hausdorff distance to the template, can be considered the best candidate for locating the template in the target.
In computer graphics the Hausdorff distance is used to measure the difference between two different representations of the same 3D object particularly when generating level of detail for efficient display of complex 3D models.
If formula_5 is the surface of Earth, and formula_6 is the land-surface of Earth, then by finding the point Nemo, we see formula_42 is around 2,704.8 km.

==Related concepts==
A measure for the dissimilarity of two shapes is given by &quot;Hausdorff distance up to isometry&quot;, denoted &quot;D&quot;H. Namely, let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be two compact figures in a metric space &quot;M&quot; (usually a Euclidean space); then &quot;D&quot;H(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) is the infimum of &quot;d&quot;H(&quot;I&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), &quot;Y&quot;) among all isometries &quot;I&quot; of the metric space &quot;M&quot; to itself. This distance measures how far the shapes &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are from being isometric.

The Gromov–Hausdorff convergence is a related idea: measuring the distance of two metric spaces &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; by taking the infimum of formula_54 among all isometric embeddings formula_55 and formula_56 into some common metric space &quot;L&quot;.

<text>A West Indian is a native or inhabitant of the West Indies (the Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago). In the 1597 Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the term &quot;West Indian&quot; initially described the indigenous inhabitants of the West Indies, by 1661 the term defined &quot;an inhabitant or native of the West Indies, of European origin or descent.&quot; In the 1950s, coinciding with decolonization and the arrival of Afro-Caribbean migrants in the United Kingdom, &quot;West Indian&quot; referred to those who were Black. Inclusively, in 1961 all inhabitants of the West Indies Federation were termed &quot;West Indian&quot; regardless of their descent, besides West indian Indo-Caribbean people sometimes also use the term &quot;East Indian West Indian&quot;. The OED now defines it simply as a citizen of any West Indies nation. Some West Indian people reserve this term for citizens or natives of the British West Indies only, to the exclusion of not just the Hispanophones, but also French and Dutch West Indians.

<text>HMAS &quot;Quadrant&quot; (G11/D11/F01), named for the navigational instrument, was a Q-class destroyer operated by the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Quadrant&quot; (G67/D17) during World War II, and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) from 1945 to 1957. The ship was built during the early 1940s as one of the War Emergency Programme destroyers, and entered service in 1942.

During World War II, &quot;Quadrant&quot; served as a convoy escort in the Arctic, South Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, and operated with the British Eastern and British Pacific Fleets. At the war&#x27;s end, the ship was decommissioned and transferred to the RAN, which operated her for two years before placing her in reserve. In 1950, the ship was docked for conversion into an anti-submarine frigate. &quot;Quadrant&quot; was recommissioned in 1953, and operated with the RAN until 1957, when she was paid off. The ship was sold for breaking in 1963.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Quadrant&quot; was built to the wartime Q-class design; the third flotilla of War Emergency Programme destroyers. These ships had a displacement of 1,750 tons at standard load, and 2,388 tons at full load. The destroyer was in length overall, long between perpendiculars, and had a beam of . Propulsion was provided by two Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons geared turbines; these provided to the destroyer&#x27;s two propellers. &quot;Quadrant&quot; could reach speeds of . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 220 officers and sailors.

&quot;Quadrant&quot;″s armament (at the end of World War II) consisted of four single 4.7-inch QF Mark XI** guns, a quadruple 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot;, six single 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns, and two quadruple torpedo tube sets for  torpedoes. The ship was also fitted with four depth charge throwers, with up to 70 depth charges carried.
The destroyer was laid down by R. and W. Hawthorn, Leslie and Company Limited at Hebburn-on-Tyne, England on 24 September 1940. She was launched on 28 February 1942 by the wife of one of the shipyard&#x27;s directors. &quot;Quadrant&quot; was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 26 November 1942.

==Royal Navy service==
During World War II, &quot;Quadrant&quot; served with the British Eastern and British Pacific Fleets.

&quot;Quadrant&quot; was engaged in convoy escort duties in the Arctic, South Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. She took part in the North African landings, aircraft carrier strikes against Surabaya and bombardment of the Nicobar Islands. She served with the British Pacific Fleet in 1945 where she took part in operations against Formosa (Taiwan), Okinawa, and the Japanese home islands.

==Transfer to RAN==
&quot;Quadrant&quot; was loaned to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in exchange for the return of one of the N-class destroyers. &quot;Quadrant&quot; commissioned into the RAN on 18 October 1945, and was used to transport soldiers from New Guinea home to Australia. On 16 August 1947, the destroyer was paid off into reserve.

===Frigate conversion===
On 15 February 1950, the heavy cruiser departed Sydney for Melbourne with &quot;Quadrant&quot; in tow. The vessels arrived at Melbourne on 18 February. Conversion of &quot;Quadrant&quot; to a fast anti-submarine frigate began at the Williamstown Naval Dockyard in Melbourne during April 1950.
During the conversion; all of &quot;Quadrant&quot;″s previous armament was stripped off, and replaced with two 4-inch guns, two 40 mm Bofors cannon, and two Squids (ahead throwing anti-submarine weapons). The conversion was completed in mid 1953, and the ship recommissioned into the RAN on 16 July.

==RAN service==
After recommissioning, &quot;Quadrant&quot;″s service was mainly in Australian waters. &quot;Quadrant&quot; escorted the Royal Yacht during the visit to Australia of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in February 1954. &quot;Quadrant&quot; visited New Guinea, Manus, and New Britain in October 1954, New Zealand in March 1955, and spent a period on exercises in Far East waters in June 1955. In March 1956, she took part in exercises in Malayan waters. During June 1956 she served for a period as a surveillance vessel with the Japanese pearling fleet in the Arafura Sea. In October 1956, &quot;Quadrant&quot; again proceeded to the Far East for further exercises, visiting Hong Kong, Singapore, and Manila. By 1957 the frigate was already worn out and the decision to decommission the vessel was made before sister ship ″s frigate conversion was complete and after the premature decommissioning due to hull failure.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Quadrant&quot; paid off at Sydney on 16 August 1957 and was sold for scrap to the Japanese firm of Kinoshita and Company Limited on 15 February 1963.

<text>HMAS &quot;Quiberon&quot; (G81/D20/D281/F03) was a Q-class destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Although built for the Royal Navy and remaining British property until 1950, &quot;Quiberon&quot; was one of two Q-class destroyers commissioned into the RAN during World War II. She was passed into full RAN ownership in 1950, and converted into an anti-submarine frigate.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Quiberon&quot; was one of eight Q-class destroyers constructed as a flotilla under the War Emergency Programme. These ships had a standard displacement of 1,705 tons, and a deep load displacement of 2,424 tons. &quot;Quiberon&quot; was long overall, and long between perpendiculars, with a beam of . Propulsion was provided by two Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons Impulse turbines, which generated for the propeller shafts. &quot;Quiberon&quot; achieved a maximum speed of during full-power trials. At , she had a range of only , but could travel at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 8 officers and 181 sailors.

The ship&#x27;s main armament consisted of four QF 4.7 inch Mk IX guns in single turrets. This was supplemented by a quadruple 2-pounder pom-pom, and six 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns. Four depth-charge throwers were fitted, with a payload of 70 charges carried, and two quadruple 21-inch torpedo tube sets were fitted, although a maximum of eight torpedoes were carried.

&quot;Quiberon&quot; was laid down by J. Samuel White and Company at their shipyard in Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, on 14 October 1940. She was launched on 31 January 1942 by the wife of Rear Admiral S. D. Tillard, Flag Officer in Charge, Southampton. &quot;Quiberon&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 6 July 1942. Although commissioned as an Australian ship, the destroyer initially remained the property of the Royal Navy. The ship was named after the Battle of Quiberon Bay, which occurred in 1759.

==Operational history==

===World War II===
&quot;Quiberon&quot; first served on North Atlantic convoy escort duty, operating out of Scapa Flow. She was assigned to support the Allied landings in North Africa in October 1942. On 28 November, &quot;Quiberon&quot; attacked and sank the Italian submarine off the Tunisian coast. After this, the destroyer was assigned to &quot;Force Q&quot;, which was based at Bône and consisted of three cruisers and two other Q-class destroyers.

====Battle of Skerki Bank====
Around midnight on 1 December, Force Q located and attacked an Italian convoy of four merchant ships and escorting destroyers about to the north of Cape Bon. All four supply ships, carrying mostly troops and munitions, were sunk, and at 01:35 on 2 December &quot;Quiberon&quot; fired the final shot into the Italian torpedo boat which was part of the escort of another convoy. While returning to port, sister ship was torpedoed by a German aircraft: &quot;Quiberon&quot; evacuated most of the other destroyer&#x27;s personnel. On 21 December, &quot;Quiberon&quot; rescued survivors from the passenger vessel &quot;Strathallen&quot;.

====Indian Ocean and Pacific service====

In January 1943, the destroyer escorted a convoy from England to Cape Town, then made for Victoria, Australia for refit. After work was completed, &quot;Quiberon&quot; was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet, primarily as a convoy escort across the Indian Ocean. In July 1943, the ship rescued survivors from , that was sunk by U-boat &quot;U-177&quot;. In April 1944, the destroyer was part of the carrier escort screen during Operation Cockpit, then again in May for Operation Transom: air raids against Japanese forces occupying the Dutch East Indies. After a brief refit in Melbourne, &quot;Quiberon&quot; resumed operations with the Eastern Fleet in August. In October, she took part in a series of fleet bombardments of the Japanese-held Nicobar Islands. In mid December, &quot;Quiberon&quot; was reassigned to Australian waters as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol vessel. During early 1945, the destroyer was attached to the British Pacific Fleet. Operating from Manus Island, &quot;Quiberon&quot; took part in operations in support of the American seizure of Okinawa and attacks on the Japanese home islands.

====Immediate post-war service====
At the end of World War II, &quot;Quiberon&quot; was present at the Allied reoccupation of Singapore, and spent the period until February 1946 operating in the East Indies to help reestablish Dutch control, move troops, and repatriate prisoners-of-war. The ship received eight battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Mediterranean 1942&quot;, &quot;North Africa 1942–43&quot;, &quot;Atlantic 1943&quot;, &quot;Indian Ocean 1943–44&quot;, &quot;East Indies 1944&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1945&quot;, &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;, and &quot;Japan 1945&quot;. Between 1946 and 1948, &quot;Quiberon&quot; was deployed with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force on three occasions.

===Frigate conversion===

In early 1950, the decision was made to convert all five Q-class destroyers in RAN service (three more had been acquired after World War II) to anti-submarine warfare frigates, similar to the Type 15 frigate conversions performed on several War Emergency Programme destroyers of the RN. A proposal was made by the Australian government to pay for the upgrade to the five on-loan vessels, at the predicted cost of AU£400,000 each. Instead, the British Admiralty presented the ships to the RAN on 1 June as gifts. The conversions were part of an overall plan to improve the anti-submarine warfare capability of the RAN, although &quot;Quiberon&quot; and the other ships were only a &#x27;stopgap&#x27; measure until purpose-built ASW frigates could be constructed.

&quot;Quiberon&quot; paid off on 15 May 1950 for conversion at Cockatoo Island Dockyard and Garden Island Dockyard in Sydney. She was recommissioned on 18 December 1957.

===Post-conversion service===
&quot;Quiberon&quot; served in the Far East with the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve and as a unit of the Australian Fleet on the Australia Station. The frigate made a port visit to Burma in 1959; the last RAN vessel to do so until in 2014.

In October 1962 &quot;Quiberon&quot; together with HMAS &quot;Queenborough&quot; rescued 25 survivors from the Panamaian merchant steamer &quot;Kawi&quot;, which sank after being caught in a storm in the South China Sea. In December 1962, again with HMAS &quot;Queenborough&quot;, HMAS &quot;Quiberon&quot; rescued the crew of the SS &quot;Tuscany&quot;, which had run aground on a reef in the South China Sea.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Quiberon&quot; paid off to reserve on 26 June 1964. She was sold for scrap to the Fujita Salvage Company Limited of Osaka, Japan on 15 February 1972, and left Sydney under tow on 10 April 1972.

<doc id="429320" wikidata="Q4353248" url="?curid=429320" title="HMAS Quickmatch (G92)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Quickmatch&quot; (G92/D21/D292/F04) was a Q-class destroyer operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Although commissioned into the RAN in 1942, the ship was initially the property of the Royal Navy. &quot;Quickmatch&quot; served with both the British Eastern Fleet and British Pacific Fleet during World War II. In the 1950s, the destroyer was converted into an anti-submarine frigate. In 1957, &quot;Quickmatch&quot; operated in support of Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. The ship remained in service until 1963, and after use as an accommodation ship, was sold for scrap in 1972.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Quickmatch&quot; was one of eight Q-class destroyers constructed as a flotilla under the War Emergency Programme. She had a standard displacement of 1,750 tons, and a deep load displacement of 2,420 tons. &quot;Quickmatch&quot; was long overall, and long between perpendiculars, with a beam of . Propulsion was provided by two Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons Impulse turbines, which generated for the propeller shafts. &quot;Quickmatch&quot; had a maximum speed of . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 220 officers and sailors.

The ship&#x27;s main armament consisted of four QF 4.7 inch Mk IX guns in single turrets. This was supplemented by a quadruple 2-pounder pom-pom, and six 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns. Four depth-charge throwers were fitted, with a payload of 70 charges carried, and two quadruple 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tube sets were fitted, although a maximum of eight torpedoes were carried.

The ship was laid down by J. Samuel White and Company Limited at their shipyard in Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, on 6 February 1941. She was launched on 11 April 1942 by the wife of the company&#x27;s deputy chairman. &quot;Quickmatch&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 14 September 1942. Despite being commissioned into the RAN, &quot;Quickmatch&quot; remained the property of the British government until the early 1950s, when she was gifted to the RAN. The ship&#x27;s name came from the quick match, a fast burning match used for lighting cannon.

==Operational history==

===World War II===
From October 1942, &quot;Quickmatch&quot; operated as a convoy escort vessel; initially in British waters, then in the South Atlantic, then in the Indian Ocean. In July 1943, the ship rescued survivors from , that was sunk by U-boat &quot;U-177&quot;. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship was assigned to a force dedicated to covering convoys between the Gulf of Aden and India. In May 1944, the destroyer joined the British Eastern Fleet. Shortly after, the destroyer formed part of the carrier screen during Operation Transom, an air raid on Japanese-held Surabaya. This role was repeated in June during an air attack on the Andaman Islands.

In October, &quot;Quickmatch&quot; arrived in Australia for a refit. After this, she remained in Australian waters until March 1945, when she was reassigned to the British Pacific Fleet. As part of this force, &quot;Quickmatch&quot; took part in operations in support of the American seizure of Okinawa and attacks on the Japanese home islands. The ship received six battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;English Channel 1942&quot;, &quot;Atlantic 1943&quot;, &quot;Indian Ocean 1943–44&quot;, &quot;Sabang 1944&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1944–45&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.

===Post-war and frigate conversion===
Over the following years, &quot;Quickmatch&quot; made several deployments to Japanese and Korean waters, with the rest of her time spent operating around Australia. On 15 May 1950, &quot;Quickmatch&quot; paid off for a major refit in which she was converted to an anti-submarine frigate at Williamstown Naval Dockyard in Victoria. She was recommissioned on 23 September 1955. Afterwards, she was deployed to Singapore as part of Australia&#x27;s contribution to the Far East Strategic Reserve. In 1957, &quot;Quickmatch&quot; operated in support of British Commonwealth forces deployed during the Malayan Emergency, for which she was later awarded her seventh battle honour, &quot;Malaya 1957&quot;.

&quot;Quickmatch&quot;, along with HMS &quot;Cavendish&quot; rescued survivors when the stores vessel HMAS &quot;Woomera&quot; exploded and sank off Sydney Heads on 11 October 1960.

On 10 November 1960 &quot;Quickmatch&quot; rescued the crew of an Indonesian Proa with failed engines near Singapore.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Quickmatch&quot; performed routine duties until she paid off to reserve at Williamstown on 26 April 1963. After paying off she served as an accommodation ship until she was sold for scrap to the Fujita Salvage Company Limited of Osaka in Japan on 15 February 1972. The ship departed Melbourne for Japan under tow on 6 July 1972.

<text>The National Honor Society (NHS) is one of the oldest, largest, and most widely recognized cocurricular student organizations in American high schools, with 1.4 million members.

The purpose of the NHS is to create enthusiasm for scholarship, to recognize outstanding students, to stimulate a desire to render service, to promote leadership, and to develop character in the students of secondary schools.

Membership in local NHS chapters is an honor bestowed upon a student by a Faculty Council and is based on the four pillars of NHS: scholarship, character, leadership, and service. Once selected, members have the responsibility to continue to demonstrate these qualities.

==History==
The National Honor Society was established on March 1, 1921 by Dr. Edward Rynearson, a member of the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP), which is the parent organization of the NHS. Rynearson, then the principal of Fifth Avenue High School in Pittsburgh, PA, envisioned an organization that would balance academics and athletics while emphasizing the role of high schools as a foundation for democracy. Prior to the establishment of the NHS, numerous local and regional honor societies existed, but the NHS was the first organization of its kind with a national scope.

Since its inception, the NHS has expanded significantly, with over 17,000 active chapters across the United States and beyond.

In 1929, the NHS furthered its reach by introducing the National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) for middle school students. This expansion was complemented in 2008 with the creation of the National Elementary Honor Society, a collaboration between the NASSP and the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), aimed at elementary school students.

The NHS operates through a decentralized model, granting autonomy to local chapters for innovation and adaptation within the framework of the NHS National Constitution. This approach allows chapters to address specific local needs while adhering to the overarching principles of the organization.

The operational management of the NHS is overseen by the NASSP, with strategic guidance provided by the NASSP Board of Directors. This structure ensures the continuity of Rynearson&#x27;s vision and the organization&#x27;s impact on students&#x27; lives.

==Symbols==
The four pillars of NHS are Scholarship, Character, Leadership, and Service. Its colors are blue and gold.

==Chapters==
National Honor Society chapters operate in all fifty states, territories, and many schools around the world, engaging and serving more than 1.4 million students.

== Activities ==
Each year, the average NHS chapter contributes:
* 1,000 hours of school/community service
* $26,000 in charitable donations

<doc id="429323" wikidata="Q534049" url="?curid=429323" title="Saint Petroc">
<text>Petroc or Petrock (; ; ; ) was a British prince and Christian saint.

Probably born in South Wales, he primarily ministered to the Britons of Devon (Dewnens) and Cornwall (Kernow) then forming the kingdom of Dumnonia where he is associated with a monastery at Padstow, which is named after him (Pedroc-stowe, or &#x27;Petrock&#x27;s Place&#x27;). Padstow appears to have been his earliest major cult centre, but Bodmin became the major centre for his veneration when his relics were moved to the monastery there in the later ninth century. Bodmin monastery became one of the wealthiest Cornish foundations by the eleventh century. There is a second ancient dedication to him nearby at Little Petherick or &quot;Saint Petroc Minor&quot;.

In Devon ancient dedications total a probable seventeen (plus Timberscombe just over the border in Somerset), mostly coastal and including one within the old Roman walls of Exeter as well as the villages of Petrockstowe and Newton St Petroc. In Wales his name is commemorated at St Petrox near Pembroke, Ferwig near Cardigan and Llanbedrog on the Llŷn Peninsula. He also became a popular saint in Brittany by the end of the tenth century.

==Life==

The earliest &quot;Life&quot; of Petroc states that he was a younger son of an unnamed Welsh chieftain: the twelfth century version known as the &quot;Gotha Life&quot;, written at Bodmin, identifies that king as Glywys of Glywysing (Orme 2000, p. 215) and Petroc as a brother of Gwynllyw and uncle of Cadoc. 

He studied in Ireland, where later he is said to have been the teacher of Kevin of Glendalough. He made a pilgrimage to Rome, and returning to Cornwall, the wind and tide brought him to Trebetherick. He founded a monastery and school at Lanwethinoc (the church of Wethinoc, an earlier holy man), at the mouth of the river Camel on the North Cornish Coast. It came to be called Petrocs-Stow (Petroc&#x27;s Place), now Padstow. 

Guron founded a hermitage at Bodmin, but left for the coast upon the arrival of Petroc. St Guron&#x27;s Well is located a at the western entrance to the churchyard of St Petroc&#x27;s Church, Bodmin. All accounts indicate that Petroc retired from Padstow to Bodmin.

Petroc ministered throughout Dumnonia, which centred in Dewnans (Devon), and included Kernow (Cornwall), Somerset and Dorset. He also served in Brittany.

Petroc founded churches in Little Petherick and in many parts of Britain, Wales and Brittany. He is said to have converted Constantine of Cornwall to Christianity by saving a deer Constantine was hunting. Constantine later established a hermitage at what is now called Constantine Bay. After thirty years, legend says that Petroc went on the pilgrimage to Rome by way of Brittany. The place of his death was reputedly at a house belonging to a family named Rovel, thought to be a farm now called Treravel near Little Petherick.

==Veneration==
With Piran and Michael, he is one of the patron saints of Cornwall. He was described by Thomas Fuller as &quot;the captain of Cornish saints&quot;.

Humility is a virtue strongly associated with Petroc. One of the pervasive stories about this describes his return from the pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem. As he set foot home in Britain under a heavy rain, he confidently told his companions that it would clear up by morning. Instead, the downpour lasted for many days and Petroc, ashamed of his presumptuousness, is said to have left on another pilgrimage, this one of penance. Legendarily he travelled as far as India where he is said to have tamed a wolf. In iconography, he is frequently depicted with this unlikely pet. Also, like several other British saints, Petroc is often shown with a stag.

In 936, King Athelstan of England annexed Cornwall and granted privilege of sanctuary to Padstow, there only being two other churches in Cornwall with this privilege.

His feast day is 4 June. His major shrine was always at St Petroc&#x27;s Church, Bodmin. In 1177, a Breton stole his relics from Bodmin and gave them to the Abbey of St Meen. However, Henry II restored them and, though the relics were thrown out during the English Reformation, their ivory casket is still on public display at St. Petroc&#x27;s in Bodmin. His remains were reputed to have ended up in the bay of Hailemouth near Padstow. A list in the Leofric missal and another manuscript list in Exeter Cathedral record that the cathedral possessed relics of the saint. It is likely that they had been presented by King Athelstan.

Petroc is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 4 June.

<doc id="429326" wikidata="Q35392" url="?curid=429326" title="Demotic Greek">
<text>Demotic Greek (, , , ) is the standard spoken language of Greece in modern times and, since the resolution of the Greek language question in 1976, the official language of Greece. &quot;Demotic Greek&quot; (with a capital D) contrasts with the conservative Katharevousa, which was used in formal settings, during the same period. In that context, Demotic Greek describes the specific non-standardized vernacular forms of Greek used by the vast majority of Greeks during the 19th and 20th centuries.

As is typical of diglossic situations, Katharevousa and Demotic complemented and influenced each other. Over time, Demotic became standardized. In 1976, it was made the official language of Greece. It continued to evolve and is now called Standard Modern Greek. The term &quot;demotic Greek&quot; (with a minuscule d) also refers to any variety of the Greek language which has evolved naturally from Ancient Greek and is popularly spoken.

==Basic features==
Demotic Greek differs in a few ways from Ancient Greek and from subsequent learned forms of Greek. Syntactically, it favours parataxis over subordination. It also heavily employs redundancy, such as (&quot;small little-girl&quot;) and (&quot;he-went-back-to-sleep again&quot;). Demotic also employs the diminutive with great frequency, to the point that many Demotic forms are in effect neuter diminutives of ancient words, especially irregular ones, e.g. from (&quot;island&quot;) from ancient (&quot;island&quot;).

Greek noun declensions underwent considerable alteration, with irregular and less productive forms being gradually regularized (e.g. ancient being replaced by (&quot;man&quot;)). Another feature is the merging of classical accusative and nominative forms: They are only distinguished in Demotic by their definite articles, which continued to be declined as in Ancient Greek. This was especially common with nouns of the third declension, such as (&quot;hometown&quot;, &quot;fatherland&quot;) which became nominative , accusative in Demotic.

A result of this regularization of noun forms in Demotic is that most native words end in a vowel, &quot;s&quot; (), or &quot;n&quot; (). Thus, the set of possible word-final sounds is even more restricted than in Ancient Greek. Exceptions are foreign loans like (&quot;bar&quot;), learned forms (from Ancient Greek , &quot;water&quot;), and exclamations like (&quot;ach!&quot;, &quot;oh!&quot;). Many dialects even append the vowel -&quot;e&quot; () to third-person verb forms: instead of (&quot;they write&quot;). Word-final consonant clusters are also rare, again mainly occurring in learned discourse and via foreign loans: (&quot;coal&quot; – scientific) and (&quot;boxing&quot; – sport).

The indirect object is usually expressed by prepending the word to the accusative or genitive (especially with regard to means or instrument). Bare is used without the article to express an indefinite duration of time, or contracted with the definite article for definiteness (especially with regard to place where or motion toward). By contrast, Katharevousa continued to employ the older in place of .

The verb system inherited from Ancient Greek gradually evolved. The perfect, pluperfect, future perfect, and past conditional tenses were gradually replaced with conjugated forms of the verb (&quot;I have&quot;). The future tense and the subjunctive and optative moods, and eventually the infinitive, were replaced by the modal/tense auxiliaries and used with either the simplified or fused future/subjunctive forms. In contrast to this, Katharevousa employed older perfective forms and infinitives that had been mostly lost in the spoken language. However, Katharevousa did sometimes employ the same aorist or perfective forms as the spoken language, but preferred an archaizing form of the present indicative, e.g. for Demotic (&quot;I hide&quot;), which both have the same aorist form .

Demotic Greek also borrowed a significant number of words from other languages, including Italian and Turkish, something which Katharevousa avoided.

==Demotic and Modern Greek==
===Demotic as &quot;Standard Modern Greek&quot;===
Demotic is commonly used interchangeably with &quot;Standard Modern Greek&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Nonetheless, these terms are not necessarily synonyms. While today&#x27;s Standard Modern Greek is fundamentally a continuation of earlier Demotic, it also contains—especially in its written form and formal registers—numerous words, grammatical forms, and phonetical features that did not exist in the most &quot;pure&quot; and consistent forms of Demotic during the period of diglossia in Greece. Due to these admixtures, it could even be described as a product of a &quot;merger&quot; between earlier Demotic and Katharevousa.

Furthermore, in a broader sense, the Greek term () can also describe any naturally evolved colloquial language of the Greeks, not just that of the period of diglossia. 

===Modern features that did not exist in Demotic===
The following examples are intended to demonstrate Katharevousa features in Modern Greek. They were not present in traditional Demotic and only entered the modern language through Katharevousa (sometimes as neologisms), where they are used mostly in writing (for instance, in newspapers), but also orally, especially words and fixed expressions are both understood and actively used also by non-educated speakers. In some cases, the Demotic form is used for literal or practical meanings, while the &quot;Katharevousa&quot; is used for figurative or specialized meanings: e.g. for the wing or feather of a bird, but for the wing of a building or airplane or arm of an organisation.

====Words and fixed expressions====
* (&quot;interesting&quot;)
* (&quot;at least&quot;)
* (&quot;he abducted her&quot;)
* ... (&quot;it is a fact that ...&quot;)
* (&quot;for now&quot;)
* (figurative, &quot;I wash my hands&quot; [&quot;of him, her, it&quot;]); adapted from the Ancient Greek phrase describing Pontius Pilate washing his hands at Matthew 27:24; for actual hand-washing, the Demotic phrase is .
Special dative forms:
* (&quot;thank God&quot;)
* (&quot;in the name [of] ...&quot;)
* (&quot;in cash&quot;)
* (&quot;following&quot;)
* (&quot;meanwhile&quot;)
* (&quot;in ignorance [of]&quot;)
* (&quot;moreover&quot;)
* (&quot;working&quot;, literally &quot;on the deed&quot;)
* (&quot;percent&quot;, literally &quot;in a hundred&quot;)
* (&quot;with [one&#x27;s] own hands&quot;)
====Grammatical (morphological) features====
* Adjectives ending in , , (e.g. &quot;interesting&quot;) or in , , (e.g. &quot;thoughtful&quot;) - mostly in written language.
* Declinable aorist participle, e.g. (&quot;having delivered&quot;), (&quot;[having been] born&quot;) - mostly in written language.
* Reduplication in the perfect. E.g. (&quot;invited&quot;), (&quot;obsolete&quot;)

====Phonological features====
Modern Greek features many letter combinations that were avoided in traditional Demotic:
* (e.g. &quot;misdemeanor&quot;); Demotic preferred (e.g. &quot;to err; to be guilty&quot;)
* (e.g. &quot;building, structure&quot;); Demotic preferred [e.g. &quot;(stone)mason&quot;]
* (e.g. &quot;falsity, lie&quot;); Demotic preferred (e.g. &quot;liar&quot;)
* (e.g. / &quot;I was sufficed / satisfied&quot;); Demotic preferred (e.g. )
* (e.g. &quot;yesterday&quot;); Demotic preferred [e.g. ]
* etc.

Native Greek speakers, depending upon their level of education, may often make mistakes in these &quot;educated&quot; aspects of their language; one can often see mistakes like instead of (&quot;I&#x27;ve been promoted&quot;), instead of (&quot;&quot;), instead of (&quot;the interesting person&quot;), instead of (&quot;the interesting women&quot;), instead of (&quot;the vote&quot;). 

==Radical demoticism==
One of the most radical proponents of a language that was to be cleansed of all &quot;educated&quot; elements was Giannis Psycharis, who lived in France and gained fame through his work &quot;My Voyage&quot; (&quot;&quot;, 1888). Not only did Psycharis propagate the exclusive use of the naturally grown colloquial language, but he actually opted for simplifying the morphology of Katharevousa forms prescription.

For instance, Psycharis proposed changing the form of the neuter noun &quot;light&quot; &#x27; (gen. &#x27;) into &#x27; (gen. &#x27;). Such radical forms had occasional precedent in Renaissance attempts to write in Demotic, and reflected Psycharis&#x27; linguistic training as a Neogrammarian, mistrusting the possibility of exceptions in linguistic evolution. Moreover, Psycharis also advocated spelling reform, which would have meant abolishing most of the six different ways to write the vowel /i/ and all instances of double consonants. Therefore, he wrote his own name as , instead of .

As written and spoken Demotic became standardized over the next few decades, many compromises were made with Katharevousa (as is reflected in contemporary standard Greek) despite the loud objections of Psycharis and the radical &quot;psycharist&quot; () camp within the proponents of Demotic&#x27;s use. Eventually these ideas of radical demoticism were largely marginalized and when a standardized Demotic was made the official language of the Greek state in 1976, the legislation stated that it would be used &quot;without dialectal and extremist forms&quot;—an explicit rejection of Psycharis&#x27; ideals.

<text>Manuel Rivera Morales (&quot;aka&quot; &quot;Manolo&quot;, &quot;El Olimpico&quot;, &quot;Mr. Apuntenlo&quot;) (May 14, 1923 – May 25, 2000) (in Spanish) was a Puerto Rican sportscaster, radio announcer and marketing sales executive. Rivera Morales is considered by many to be the best sportscaster in Puerto Rican history. &quot;The achievements of &#x27;El Olimpico&#x27; (The Olympian) have given him national and international regard and have left huge prints in our hearts.&quot; (Puerto Rican Legislature, Law #228, 1998)

==Early life==
Rivera Morales was born in Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico on May 14, 1923. He was inducted in the Hall of Fame for Puerto Rican Sports on November 22, 1992. In 1998 the Government of Puerto Rico honored Rivera by naming a main highway after him: PR-181 Road, &quot;Expreso Manuel Rivera Morales&quot;, also known as &quot;El Expreso de Trujillo Alto&quot; (Trujillo Alto Expressway).

==Career==
Manuel Rivera Morales gained nationwide fame in Puerto Rico during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, when he covered BSN basketball games live, first on radio, and later on television, for various broadcasters (most famously WAPA-TV), along other famous Puerto Rican sportscasters such as Johnny Flores Monge, Rafael Bracero and &quot;Fufi Santori&quot;. Rivera Morales became a cultural icon in Puerto Rico: His phrases, many of which he invented, were commonly repeated by many Puerto Ricans and became part of colloquial Puerto Rican dialogue.

When he accompanied the Puerto Rican team that played the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo to broadcast the games through radio, his style was so colorful and attracted so much attention that a local Japanese newspaper covered him. In Japan, he was also recognized with a medal as &quot;The World&#x27;s Best and Most Dramatic Narrator&quot;. He started as an Olympic sportscaster in the 1960 Olympics held in Rome and continued during the following games: 1964 Tokyo, 1968 Mexico, 1972 Munich y 1976 Montreal. Due to this vast Olympic experience, he was nicknamed &quot;El Olimpico&quot; (The Olympian). He also was a narrator for the Pan-American Games and for the famous &quot;Roller Derby&quot; television show (Puerto Rico&#x27;s Spanish version).

Morales was also recognized for giving nicknames to some of Puerto Rico&#x27;s basketball players. José Ortiz, for example, was nicknamed &quot;El Concorde&quot; by Rivera Morales. Mario Morales became &quot;El Quijote&quot; (was better known by his nickname than by his real name), José Sosa &quot;El Galgo&quot; (The Greyhound), Angel &quot;Cachorro&quot; Santiago &quot;El Orgullo del Caserio&quot; (The Pride of the Housing Projects), Hector &quot;El Mago&quot; Blondet (The Magician), Rolando Frazier &quot;&quot;El Principe&quot; (The Prince), Mario Butler &quot;El Expreso Panameño&quot; (The Panamanian Express), Ruben Rodriguez &quot;Sharp Shooter&quot;&quot;, and Martín Ansa got the nickname &quot;El Señor&quot; from Morales.

During the 1970s and 1980s, local laws established that boxing fights held in Puerto Rico could not be transmitted live on television; this to encourage fans to pay tickets to see the fights live. They were, however, transmitted live by radio, and Rivera Morales also became a well-known boxing commentator on the Puerto Rican radio stations. In the 1970s he also announced professional wrestling. He also announced horse racing events from Hipódromo Camarero along with Norman H. Davila, among others.

==Death==
Rivera Morales suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He died on 25 May 2000.

==Legacy==
In 2020, 21 years after Rivera Morales death and during the 2020 Summer Olympics, his voice was heard commenting when the Puerto Rico women&#x27;s national basketball team played. The arduous project, accomplished with the help of artificial intelligence was completed in partnership with the Cervecera de Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee.

==His popular phrases==
Some phrases popularized by Manuel Rivera Morales include:

- &quot;¡Apuntenlo!!&quot; (score it!!) - His trademark phrase, and a reminder to the radio crew&#x27;s scorer to write down the latest successful two-point basket.

- &quot;¡Manos Arriba!! Manos Arriba!&quot; (Hands up! Hands up!) After a three-point shot had been made, alluding to the gesture that basketball referees do after a three-point basket.

- &quot;¡Que juego señores... que juego!&quot; (What a great game gentlemen... what a great game.)

- &quot;¡Me va a poner a gozar... y me puso a gozar!&quot; (He&#x27;s going to make me enjoy... he made me enjoy.) Referring to a dunk.

- &quot;Yo lo conozco... va a tirar...&quot; (I know him... he&#x27;s going to shoot.) Anticipating a play.

- &quot;¡Miralooooooooo!&quot; (Look at him.) Anticipating a basket.

- &quot;¡Ayúdanos, divina Pastora, a salir de aqui con vida!&quot; (Help us, &quot;Divine Shepherdess&quot;, to get out of here alive!!) A religious imploration used by him in a playfull tone when a basketball game was close enough for the visiting team to steal a win during the closing minutes, he also used this phrase when the visiting team&#x27;s lead was deemed as too large to overcome with a short time left in the game.

- &quot;Wonderful!!&quot;

- &quot;¡Sensacional!&quot; (Sensational) He&#x27;d say this after an impressive play.

- &quot;Mi abuela decía: &#x27;¡Son de goma, Manolo, son de goma!&#x27;&quot; (My grandma used to say: &quot;they&#x27;re made out of rubber, Manolo, they&#x27;re made out of rubber&quot;!) - Said after a player fell dramatically and recuperated quickly.

- &quot;¡Wes... Wes... Wes... WES!!&quot; -Whenever local (and later international) player Wesley Correa charged to the basket.

- &quot;¡Este juego es no apto para cardiacos!&quot; (This game is not suitable for cardiac patients!) - Said during close games, particularly those that ended up in overtime (at a particular one that had five OT&#x27;s he almost had a cardiac incident himself).

<text>Reno 911! is an American television sitcom created by Robert Ben Garant, Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney-Silver for Comedy Central. It is a mockumentary-style parody of law enforcement documentary shows, specifically &quot;Cops&quot;, with comic actors playing the police officers. Lennon, Garant and Kenney-Silver all starred in and are billed as creators of the series.

The series initially aired from 2003 to 2009 on Comedy Central. A revival premiered on May 4, 2020, on streaming platform Quibi, which was renewed for an additional season (the show&#x27;s eighth) on September 3, 2020. Quibi later announced in October 2020 that it would be shutting down while the eighth season was in production. According to star Niecy Nash, the eighth season would debut on another platform, which was later revealed to be The Roku Channel. The eighth season, entitled &quot;Defunded&quot;, premiered on February 25, 2022, on The Roku Channel.

==Premise==
The show is a direct parody of the reality show &quot;Cops&quot;, which follows actual police officers through their daily duties, such as chasing criminals, and intervening in domestic disputes. &quot;Reno 911!&quot; features members of the fictitious, massively inept &quot;Reno Sheriff&#x27;s Department&quot; (in reality, Reno is under the jurisdiction of the Reno Police Department and the Washoe County Sheriff&#x27;s Office). In the course of their duties patrolling both the city of Reno and the rest of Washoe County, Nevada, the deputies sometimes address the camera directly (as though being interviewed for a documentary). The show deals heavily in politically incorrect and racy humor, including many jokes about race, sexual orientation, substance abuse, rape, pedophilia, and mental disorders. Another main comedic aspect of the show is the outlandishly severe incompetence of the deputies—often resulting in their being outsmarted by the criminals they are attempting to control.

Unlike &quot;Cops&quot;, which the show parodies, &quot;Reno 911!&quot; Sheriff&#x27;s deputies are constantly cursing, causing much of their dialogue to be censored for broadcast. The actors often perform their own stunts. Criminals on the series are portrayed by a variety of comedians, and sometimes by main cast members performing a dual role; in these instances, the cast member&#x27;s face will be blurred in the style of &quot;Cops&quot;.

The show&#x27;s characters occasionally refer to their own program. They insist that the show&#x27;s producers told them the videotaped footage was going to be used for a Fox Television documentary series titled &quot;Heroes on Patrol&quot;, and often say in frustration that they have no control over what is aired, and that the show only seems to capture their moments of incompetence. The many &quot;good&quot; incidents, they allege, are left out of the (show-within-a-show&#x27;s) final edit. Also, some suspects in the show refer to the film crew, and the program being aired on television; occasionally, they will attempt to get arrested just to be on TV.

==History==
===Development===
In Lennon&#x27;s words, &quot;Reno 911!&quot; came about, &quot;like the best of ideas, through total desperation.&quot; Following the end of &quot;Viva Variety&quot;, &quot;The State&quot; alumnus worked on a series of pilots for the Fox Broadcasting Company, one of which, after a year&#x27;s worth of dedicated writing, was terminated the day before shooting. It was scheduled to begin in the fall of 2000. With a month left before the pilot was expected to be due (and half of the budget still unused), the team asked if they could produce another pilot with the remaining resources, and the Fox executives agreed. Working quickly to take advantage of this, the initial &quot;Reno 911!&quot; pilot was conceived and shot in five days. Cedric Yarbrough, who had been hired for the cast of the canceled pilot, said that the cast was advised to &quot;come up with [their] own characters&quot; and return for filming.

As originally written, the sheriff&#x27;s department material would have served as link material between traditional comedy sketches; the canceled project was being considered for the Fox Saturday lineup, and the team thought at the time that the &quot;Cops&quot; format was a natural framework for sketch comedy. However, during the shooting—and especially the editing—they realized the police element was more interesting than the sketches, and the finished pilot was, according to Garant, &quot;remarkably similar&quot; to the series that eventually aired. Nevertheless, Fox turned down the completed pilot. According to Lennon, their decision not to pick the show up was influenced by a scene, preserved in the eventual Comedy Central pilot, involving Lt. Dangle passionately kissing a man. It was another two years before Comedy Central greenlit the project.

===Filming===
Establishing shots were filmed on location in Reno, with everything else in Los Angeles and Carson, California, with some parts in Oregon.

Starting from the fifth season onward, certain segments are also shot in the small town of Piru, California. The exterior and interior shots of the Reno Sheriff&#x27;s Department station were filmed on location at the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department substation in Carson. Many of the main scenes of the show were shot over the course of many hours, such as the briefing room scenes. According to the third season DVD commentary, all morning briefing scenes for a season may be filmed on one 10-hour day with different basic plot elements to be used in different episodes. Actors would contribute their dialogue as they were inspired to do so.

===Original run===
&quot;Reno 911!&quot; continued for two additional seasons with a special, entitled &quot;Off Duty&quot;, on March 21, 2004.

The first half of the fourth season, comprising 7 episodes, began on July 9, 2006. In February 2007, a theatrical film, &quot;Reno 911!: Miami&quot;, was released in North America, featuring the complete series cast. It was a moderate box office success, grossing $22 million worldwide. The second half of season 4, another 7 episodes, drew 1.3 million viewers during the week of March 26 to April 1, 2007.

On October 9, 2006, Comedy Central confirmed 13 new episodes to make up a fifth season, though the season actually contained 16 episodes. Production started in January and wrapped in April. Season 5 premiered on January 16, 2008.

On March 27, 2007, Superstation WGN acquired the first four seasons for a two-year run. The syndicated &quot;Reno 911!&quot; is a part of their late night comedy block. Reruns are syndicated to broadcast stations. Lennon and Garant later appeared in-character on a comedy compilation CD, &quot;Comedy Death-Ray&quot;, released on September 11, 2007, singing a song about why not to use drugs.

On November 10, 2008, Comedy Central confirmed 10 new episodes to make up a sixth and final season. Principal photography was done between November and December 2008. Carmen Electra was a guest star on an episode filmed December 5, 2008 at Grant High School in Los Angeles. Season Six premiered on April 1, 2009, on Comedy Central. Season 6 consisted of fifteen episodes. Cast members Alazraqui, McLendon-Covey and Birdsong did not return for the final season and their characters&#x27; absences were explained as fatalities from an explosion in the fifth season finale. Additionally, actors Ian Roberts and Joe Lo Truglio were added to the principal cast as Sergeant Jack Declan and Deputy Frank Salvatore Rizzo, respectively.

On August 13, 2009, Lennon announced through Twitter that the show had ended its six-year run. In response to the cancellation, Reno residents and officials petitioned to save the show.

===Revival===
In October 2011, a story broke that the producers were in negotiations with the streaming service Netflix for a revival. The primary reason producers wanted to revive the show was because only 88 episodes were produced, and they and syndicating networks would have liked for the show to reach 100 episodes. However, at the time, Comedy Central, who still held sole rights, had not been involved in any negotiations. Furthermore, Lennon and Garant were attached to other projects.

It was announced on December 6, 2019, that the series would be revived in 2020 on streaming platform Quibi. The revival featured the return of the original series creators Lennon, Garant and Kenney-Silver. In a statement, Lennon said: &quot;&quot;Reno 911!&quot; holds a special place in our hearts, and it will be a delight to get the original cast back together for &#x27;re-boot goofin&#x27;. Hopefully Nick Swardson can still roller skate. Quibi&#x27;s short format seems custom made for our show.&quot;

Filming of the seventh season started in early 2020, where the production crew was spotted in Piru, California on February 23, 2020. On April 10, 2020, it was announced that the revival was set to premiere on May 4, 2020. On September 3, 2020, the show was renewed for an eighth season. On October 23, 2020, it was announced that Quibi would be shutting down. The eighth season, titled &quot;Reno 911! Defunded&quot;, made its debut on The Roku Channel on February 25, 2022. On September 7, 2023, it was reported that the series was removed from the service. All seasons of &quot;Reno 911!&quot; are currently available on the streaming service Paramount+.

Season six newcomers Joe Lo Truglio and Ian Roberts had appeared as guest stars in past seasons, and both also appeared in &quot;Reno 911: Miami&quot;. As a member of &quot;The State&quot;, Lo Truglio is an old friend of the three creators and has worked with them on numerous projects. Roberts is a founding member of the popular Upright Citizens Brigade improv comedy troupe, who had their own Comedy Central sketch show from 1998 to 2000. Other members of the troupe (Matt Besser and Matt Walsh) also appeared in recurring guest roles throughout the seasons. Amy Poehler is the only member of the &quot;UCB 4&quot; to have never appeared on the show in any form.

Throughout the show&#x27;s run, all three main cast members from &quot;Stella&quot; (who were also from &quot;The State&quot;) made appearances as characters. While Michael Showalter was the exception on the TV series, he appeared in the film, along with all of the cast members of &quot;The State&quot;.

The series spawned a film released in 2007. In the film, the deputies are called in to save the day after a terrorist attack disrupts a national police convention and locks over 2,000 police officers in a hotel in Miami Beach during spring break.

In December 2017, Nash said another film is in the works, but it is unknown if it evolved into anything that came after.

On December 23, 2021, &quot;Reno 911! The Hunt for QAnon&quot; was released on Paramount+. The film involves the deputies of the Reno Sheriff&#x27;s Department as they hunt for Q, the one behind all of the QAnon conspiracies. Their efforts cause them to get stuck at a QAnon convention at sea.

On October 28, 2022, a third movie was announced to be released on Comedy Central. A Christmas movie titled &quot;Reno 911! It&#x27;s a Wonderful Heist&quot;: it premiered December 3, 2022.

<doc id="429331" wikidata="Q5630561" url="?curid=429331" title="HMAS Shoalhaven">
<text>HMAS &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; (K535/M535/F535), named for the Shoalhaven River in New South Wales, was a modified of the Royal Australian Navy. She was laid down by Walkers at Maryborough on 18 December 1943, launched on 14 December 1944 by Senator Dorothy Tangney and commissioned at Urangan Pier in Hervey Bay in Queensland on 2 May 1946. Her first commander was Commander Rodney Rhoades.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Shoalhaven&quot; was originally ordered as part of an Australian shipbuilding program during World War II that would provide 22 River-class frigates for the RAN. The first eight ships were completed to this specification, before the design was modified, now based on the British . Despite this change, the remaining planned ships would still be named after Australian rivers. At the end of the war, the order was cancelled, except for four, including &quot;Shoalhaven&quot;, which had already been launched. HMAS &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; was the third of the four modified River-class ships to enter service and was the lead ship of the Navy&#x27;s First Frigate Flotilla.

==Operational history==
===1940s===
After her commissioning, &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; made several trips to New Guinea between 1946 and 1948, supporting a mines clearance unit. Between January and April 1949, she participated in exercises with the Royal Navy and United States Navy in Asia, visiting both Shanghai and Hong Kong. While assigned to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Far East Fleet in April of that year, the Admiralty identified &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; to relieve HMS &quot;Consort&quot; as guard ship to support Chinese nationalist diplomats in the port of Nanking. The Menzies government in Canberra denied permission for the ship to be used for a mission that was viewed as purely symbolic, with no apparent objective. &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; would only be made available to sail up the Yangtze River for mercy missions in the event the nationalists fell to communist forces with no other means of evacuation. This restriction forced the Admiralty to instead dispatch HMS &quot;Amethyst&quot; from Hong Kong to relieve &quot;Consort&quot;, with both British vessels subsequently attacked by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in what is now known as the Yangtze Incident.

&quot;Shoalhaven&quot; returned to Australia in June 1949. She was again assigned to the Far East to support the Commonwealth occupation forces in Japan, arriving at Kure in January 1950. &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; was in Kure on 25 June 1950 when North Korea unexpectedly invaded South Korea, escalating the conflict on the peninsula to open warfare.

===Korean War===
&quot;Shoalhaven&quot; was committed to military action in support of South Korea on 29 June, again assigned to the British Far East Fleet commanded by Rear-Admiral William Andrewes. The ship carried out the first Australian operation of the war on 1 July under the command of Commander Ian McDonald with 6 officers and 177 sailors aboard, providing escort for United Nations ships carrying troops and ammunition to Korean ports from Japan. Having successfully escorted an American ship &quot;Sergeant George D. Keathley&quot; from Tsushima Island into the port of Busan, on 2 July she departed for the American base at Sasebo, Japan carrying a South Korean liaison party. On 6 July, &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; joined the destroyer USS &quot;Collett&quot; off the west coast of Korea where she was performed blockade duties during a three day patrol. The frigate then resumed her escort role through July and August, successfully escorting 14 convoys during her tour. &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; also performed routine anti-submarine duties and bombardment of coastal targets, coming under enemy fire on several occasions.

At the outbreak of the war, &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; had been due to return to Australia for refit. With the arrival of HMAS &quot;Warramunga&quot; on 6 September, she completed her brief tour, arriving at Garden Island on 22 September. Following the Korean Armistice Agreement in July 1953, &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; was again sent to Korea to participate in allied patrols during 1954. For her role in the conflict, the ship would later receive the battle honour &quot;Korea 1950&quot;.

===1950s===
After her return from Korea, &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; operated mostly within Australian and New Guinea waters, including participating in a British nuclear weapons test in the Montebello Islands off the coast of Western Australia as part of Operation Hurricane. Her last foreign deployment lasted from July 1954 to March 1955, patrolling waters between Hong Kong, Japan and Korea to enforce the Korean Armistice.

==Decommissioning and legacy==
HMAS &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; paid off to reserve on 19 December 1955. With no need for her reactivation, &quot;Shoalhaven&quot; was sold in January 1962 to H. C. Sleigh and Company to be broken up for scrap by Mitsubishi Australia.

In September 2008, the City of Shoalhaven and veterans from the HMAS Shoalhaven Association dedicated an 18 tonne stone monument in Walsh Park, Bomaderry to commemorate the ship&#x27;s achievements during her service with the Royal Australian Navy.

<text>The Bromo (), or Mount Bromo (, ) is an active somma volcano, a Hindu pilgrimage site, and part of the Tengger mountains, in East Java, Indonesia. At it is not the highest peak of the massif, but is the most active and famous. The area is one of the most visited tourist destinations in East Java, and the volcano is included in the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. The name Bromo comes from the Javanese pronunciation of Brahma, the Hindu god of creation. At the mouth of the crater, there is an idol of Ganesha, the Hindu god of wisdom which is being worshipped by the Javanese Hindus. Mount Bromo is located in the middle of a plain called &quot;Sea of Sand&quot; (Javanese: Segara Wedi or Indonesian: Lautan Pasir), a nature reserve that has been protected since 1919.

A typical way to visit Mount Bromo is from the nearby mountain village of Cemoro Lawang. From there it is possible to walk to the volcano in about 45 minutes, but it is also possible to take an organized jeep tour, including stops at the viewpoint of Mount Penanjakan () (Indonesian: Gunung Penanjakan). The sights on Mount Penanjakan can also be reached on foot in about two hours. Depending on the level of volcanic activity, the Indonesian Center for Volcanology and Disaster Mitigation sometimes issues a warning not to visit Mount Bromo.

The neighboring Mount Batok is often mistaken as Mount Bromo due to its prominence in the caldera, and its position in front of the more flat Bromo crater as viewed from their most popular viewpoints along the northern rim.

==History of volcanic activity==

=== 2004 eruptions ===

Mount Bromo erupted in 2004. That eruptive episode led to the death of two people who had been hit by rocks from the explosion.

=== 2010 eruptions ===

On Tuesday, 23 November 2010, 16.30 WIB (&quot;Western Indonesian Time&quot;), the Indonesian Centre of Vulcanology and Geology Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM) confirmed the activity status of Mount Bromo at &quot;alert&quot; due to increasing tremor activity and shallow volcanic earthquakes at the mountain. Concerns were raised that a volcanic eruption might be likely to occur. As a precaution, local residents and tourists were instructed to remain clear of an area within a radius of three kilometers from the caldera and refugee encampments were erected. The area surrounding the Teggera caldera of Bromo remained off-limits for visitors throughout the remainder of 2010.

Bromo started to violently erupt ash on Friday 26 November 2010.

On 29 November 2010, Transport Ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan announced that Malang&#x27;s domestic airport would be closed until 4 December 2010. Malang is a city of about 800,000 people is about west of Mount Bromo. Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport normally handles 10 daily domestic flights from the capital Jakarta. Government volcanologist Surono reported that the volcano was spitting columns of ash some into the sky.

=== 2011 eruptions ===

The Tengger Caldera was still active in late January 2011, the activity being characterised by fluctuating ongoing eruptions. On 23 January 2011, the Indonesian Centre for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM; Pusat Vulkanologi dan Mitigasi Bencana Geologi) reported that since 19 December 2010 volcanic ash and incandescent material had been thrown up by eruptive activity resulting in a heavy rain of material that fell around the crater. Continuous eruptions on 21 January caused a thin ash fall mainly in the village areas of Ngadirejo and Sukapura Wonokerto in Probolinggo Regency.

The impact of a heavy rain of volcanic ash from eruptions since 19 December 2010 resulted in disruption of normal activities. By early 2011, concerns were being raised about the effect upon the local economy and the potential for long-term environmental and health problems amongst the residents in the locality surrounding Mount Bromo. Due to high seasonal rainfall in January 2011 the potential for lahar and lava flow was raised due to the deposits of volcanic ash, sand and other ejected material that had built up. Seismic activity was dominated by tremor vibration and reports of visual intensity and sounds of eruption continued to be reported from the mountain monitoring facility, Bromo Observation Post. People living on the banks of the Perahu Ravine, Nganten Ravine and Sukapura River were alerted to the possibility of lahars, especially when it was raining heavily in the area around Cemorolawang, Ngadisari and Ngadirejo. Eruptions and volcanic tremors were reported during the period 21 January – 22 January with activity subsiding on 23 January 2011. On 23 January 2011 at 6:00 am, the alert status at Mount Bromo remained at Level III.

On 23 January 2011, an exclusion zone was recommended for communities living around Mount Bromo. Tourists and hikers were advised to not come within a radius of from the active crater. CVGHM stated that they expected warning signs to be installed stating the limit radius of from the crater. Operational caution was recommended for flights into and leaving Juanda International Airport IATA:SUB in Surabaya. CVGHM recommended the establishment of public areas for the provision of face masks and eye protection. CVGHM also issued a warning to residents to be cautious of ash buildup on roofs and other places that may give cause for collapse under the burden of ash.

Further eruptions and the issuing of aviation ash advisories during the period 27–28 January 2011 led to concerns being raised regarding a volcanic ash plume, reported to be drifting eastward toward the air corridors used to access the Ngurah Rai International Airport IATA:DPS in Bali. Airport official Sherly Yunita was reported at the time as stating that concerns about visibility had prompted Singapore Airlines, Jetstar-ValueAir, Air France-KLM, Virgin Blue and Cathay Pacific to cancel several flights to Bali, to the east. SilkAir also cancelled flights on the 27 January between Singapore and Lombok, an island to the east of Bali. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in Darwin, Australia released several Code Red Aviation Ash Advisories pertaining to Mount Bromo (Tengger Caldera), on 27 January. They indicated that ash was observed at altitudes up to (FL180) extending to the south east of the caldera. In other ash advisories of that day the cloud was reported as at times having a drift, both to the east and to the south east.

===Deformation-late November 2010-late January 2011===
The Indonesian Centre for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM) reported on 13 January 2011, that deformation using tiltmeter measurements indicated an inflation at rate of 5 micro radians between 25 November 2010 – 14 December 2010 and a relatively stable since 15 December 2010 both on Radial Components and Tangential Components.

Deformation measurement using electronic distance measurement equipment compared observations at designated measuring points; POS-BRO, POS-KUR and POS-BAT during the period 25 November 2010 – 20 December 2010 with observations from the period 21 December 2010 – 30 December 2010 indicated the shortening of the distance from the POS-BAT, or inflation. Observations between 30 December 2010 – 23 January 2011 were reported as relatively stable.

===2015 eruption===
Mount Bromo showed signs of increasing activity beginning in 4th Dec 2015, when the amount of smoke coming out of the crater intensified. By late November Mount Bromo began to eject ashes into the air. Indonesian Volcano Monitoring Bureau (PVBMG) issued a warning that forbade people from climbing Mount Bromo. Later, the warning was extended into a exclusion zone, before eventually extended into wider range which virtually barred visitors from coming down into the caldera floor, which is popularly known as Sandsea.

==Culture==
On the fourteenth day of the Hindu festival of Yadnya Kasada, the Tenggerese people of Probolinggo Regency, East Java, travel up the mountain in order to make offerings of fruit, rice, vegetables, flowers and sacrifices of livestock to the mountain gods by throwing them into the caldera of the volcano. The origin of the ritual lies in the 15th century legend.
On the sand plain, locally called &quot;Segara Wedi&quot; (lit. sand ocean), sits a Hindu temple called Pura Luhur Poten. The temple holds a significant importance to the Tenggerese scattered across the mountain villages, such as Ngadisari, Wonokitri, Ngadas, Argosari, Ranu Prani, Ledok Ombo and Wonokerso. The temple organises the annual Yadnya Kasada ceremony which lasts for about one month. The major difference between this temple and Balinese ones are the type of stones and building materials. Pura Luhur Poten uses natural black stones from volcanoes nearby, while Balinese temples are mostly made from red bricks. Inside this pura, there are several buildings and enclosures aligned in a mandala zone composition.

<doc id="429334" wikidata="Q1188923" url="?curid=429334" title="TVA (Canadian TV network)">
<text>TVA, stylized as TVΛ, is a Canadian French-language terrestrial television network, owned by Groupe TVA, a publicly traded subsidiary of Quebecor Media.

Headquartered in Montreal, the network only has terrestrial stations in Quebec. However, parts of New Brunswick and Ontario are within the broadcast ranges of TVA stations, and two TVA stations operate rebroadcasters in New Brunswick. Since becoming a national network in 1998, it has been available on cable television across Canada.

TVA is short for Téléviseurs associés (roughly translated to &quot;Associated Telecasters&quot;). This reflects the network&#x27;s roots as a cooperative.

==Overview==
TVA traces its roots to 1963, when CJPM-TV in Chicoutimi, a station only a few months old and in need of revenue, began sharing programs with the largest privately owned francophone station in Canada, CFTM-TV in Montreal. They were joined by CFCM-TV in Quebec City in 1964 after CFCM lost its Radio-Canada affiliation to newly-launched CBVT. While the three stations shared programs for many years, it was not until September 12, 1971, that the informal link became a proper network, TVA, with CFTM as the flagship station. The network began the first private French-language network news service in Canada in 1972. Between 1973 and 1983, seven more stations joined the network.

When the network was formally organized in 1971, its affiliates ran it as a cooperative, much like CTV operated for many years. In 1982, the cooperative became a corporation with the station owners as shareholders.

For many years, TVA&#x27;s schedule was very similar to that of what CTV offered before Baton Broadcasting took over the network in that it did not have what could be called a main schedule aside from news. For instance, Pathonic Communications, which owned the TVA affiliates in Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Trois-Rivières and Rimouski and provided programming to the affiliates in Rivière-du-Loup and Carleton, offered programming that was different from that offered on CFTM. The differences were enough that Sherbrooke&#x27;s CHLT-TV, whose over-the-air signal reached Montreal, was carried on Montreal cable systems well into the 1980s. However, CFTM dominated the network to an even greater extent that Toronto&#x27;s CFTO-TV dominated CTV, contributing as much of 90% of the network&#x27;s programming.

In 1989, Télé-Metropole, which owned CFTM and CJPM, bought out Pathonic. The other station owners sold the outstanding shares of the network in 1992. Nine years later, Quebecor became owner of TVA.

TVA also owns Le Canal Nouvelles (LCN), Canada&#x27;s only private French-language headline-news channel. When TVA completes its broadcast day, the TVA stations simulcast LCN until TVA&#x27;s next broadcast day begins. As well, the company owns a magazine publishing division unit, a film production and distribution house, and a number of other Internet and cable properties, many of which are often used to cross-promote TVA series and events.

For many years, TVA&#x27;s reach outside Quebec was only a fraction of that of Radio-Canada. The only stations with significant viewership outside Quebec were CHOT-TV of Hull (now part of Gatineau), CIMT-TV of Rivière-du-Loup and CHAU-TV of Carleton-sur-Mer. CHOT also serves Ottawa and has been available on most cable systems in Northeastern Ontario since the early 1980s, owing to that region&#x27;s large Franco-Ontarian population. CIMT and CHAU both operate rebroadcasters in New Brunswick, and CHAU&#x27;s main transmitter covers portions of the province as well. Between them, CIMT and CHAU provide nearly all of New Brunswick with TVA service. However, TVA did provide a cable feed known as TCTV starting in 1981, consisting of most of CFTM&#x27;s programming and local news from other TVA stations.

In 1998, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission made it compulsory for all cable systems in Canada to carry a TVA station, in order to give Canada&#x27;s francophone minority communities a second French-language programming choice. The station offered is usually the network&#x27;s flagship, CFTM. However, some cable companies in Eastern and Northern Ontario continue to offer Gatineau&#x27;s CHOT, while most New Brunswick cable companies still carry CIMT or CHAU.

TVA also provides a time-shifted feed for cable companies in Western Canada. However, this feed is just an electronic delay of CFTM&#x27;s programming, rebroadcast three hours later in Pacific Time to viewers in Western Canada through a separate feed.

Although TVA is a full-fledged network, its network feed is basically a retransmission of CFTM, with opt-outs by local affiliates for local news, commercials and locally produced programming. While this allows TVA to air more network programming than any other Canadian network, it also means that CFTM usually cannot interrupt its programming for news or weather bulletins in Montreal without interrupting the entire network.

==Other services==
In 2004, TVA&#x27;s parent Groupe TVA and fellow Quebecor subsidiary Sun Media jointly acquired CKXT-TV in Toronto, an independent station once known as Toronto One under its previous owner, Craig Media, in 2004. The company&#x27;s first English-language television station, it continued to be run as an independent station, not as a TVA affiliate. It was rebranded &quot;Sun TV&quot;, after Sun Media&#x27;s local newspaper, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;. In early 2005, TVA confirmed to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that it would continue to look for other expansion opportunities in English Canada, but no further purchase announcements have been made by the company. On April 18, 2011, CKXT-TV began to simulcast the programming of a new news channel, Sun News Network, considered to be an English version of LCN. CKXT ceased operations on November 1, 2011, and the Sun News Network continued only on cable and satellite television providers until being discontinued in 2015.

Groupe TVA also operates a number of specialty channels, including addikTV, Casa, Évasion, LCN, Moi et Cie, Prise 2, QUB, and TVA Sports. The company previously operated kids&#x27; channel Yoopa from its launch in April 2010 until its demise in January 2024. Groupe TVA was also a majority owner of The Cave (now History2), which it co-owned with Shaw Media; it also equally owned Mystery TV (now Crime &amp; Investigation) with Shaw Media, with Shaw Media being managing partner. TVA sold its share in both channels to Shaw in November 2011. The company launched an online radio network QUB Radio in 2018, and launched a TV simulcast in January 2024.

<text>HMAS &quot;Success&quot; (OR 304) was a multi-product replenishment oiler that previously served in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built by Cockatoo Docks &amp; Engineering Company in Sydney, Australia, during the 1980s, she is the only ship of the class to be constructed outside France, and the only one to not originally serve in the &quot;Marine Nationale&quot; (French Navy). The ship was part of the Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War, and was deployed to East Timor in response to incidents in 1999 and 2006. The ship was fitted with a double hull during the first half of 2011, to meet International Maritime Organization standards.

&quot;Success&quot; was decommissioned at Fleet Base East on 29 June 2019, after 33 years of service, and towed to Port Pirie for scrapping in August 2019.

==Construction==
Seeing a need to replace the ageing oiler HMAS &quot;Supply&quot; (AO 195), the RAN placed an order in 1971 for a combat support ship-a replenishment vessel capable of supplying ammunition and stores in addition to fuel-to be named HMAS &quot;Protector&quot;. However, concerns about the cost of construction prompted the order&#x27;s cancellation in 1974. Instead, the Directions Techniques Des Constructions Navales was approached about constructing a &quot;Durance&quot;-class replenishment oiler for the RAN, and a design contract was awarded to the Government of France in 1977. The $68.4 million (in 1978 prices) construction contract was awarded to Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard in October 1979, with ship delivery by 31 July 1983.
The modified &quot;Durance&quot;-class oiler is in length, with a beam of , and a draught of , with a full load displacement of 18,221 tonnes. Propulsion machinery consists of two SEMT-Pielstick 16 PC2.5 V 400 diesel motors, which supply to the ship&#x27;s two propeller shafts. Top speed is , and the ship has a range of at . &quot;Success&quot; has a total capacity of 10,200 tonnes of cargo: 8,707 tonnes of diesel fuel, 975 tonnes of aviation fuel, 250 tonnes of munitions (including guided missiles and torpedoes), 116 tonnes of water, 95 tonnes of components and naval stores, and 57 tonnes of food and other consumables. Fuel and liquid stores can be transferred from four points (two on each side), allowing &quot;Success&quot; to replenish two ships simultaneously, while solid cargo can be moved via vertical replenishment (with a hangar and helipad for a single Sea King, Seahawk, or Squirrel helicopter), or by boat (the RAN LCVP &quot;T 7&quot; is carried on a starboard FWD davit). The ship is armed with seven 12.7 mm machine guns, and is fitted for but not with a Mark 15 Phalanx CIWS. The sensor suite includes two Kelvin Hughes Type 100G navigation radars. Ship&#x27;s company is made up of 25 officers and 212 sailors.

&quot;Success&quot; was laid down by Cockatoo Docks &amp; Engineering Company at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney on 9 August 1980. She was launched on 3 March 1984, and commissioned into the RAN on 23 April 1986. &quot;Success&quot; is the largest ship to ever be built in Australia for the RAN, and is the largest ship to be built in Port Jackson (the port of Sydney). She was also the last major vessel to be constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. In June 1983 the contract were renegotiated while construction was underway, with the acceptance date being extended by three years and the project cost increased to $187.3 million. The cost and time overruns were primarily due to protracted dispute between the Commonwealth and the builder over the drawings and specifications received from France, with evidence that the Department of Defence underestimated the extent of the differences between the original Australian building specifications and those supplied. Additional factors in the time and cost increases were a lack of tradesmen skilled in naval construction, overly bureaucratic management, and low labour productivity. The final project cost was estimated at $197.41 million; the dramatic increase in cost prevented the construction of a planned second ship.

==Operational history==
In 1986, &quot;Success&quot; was part of the multi-national fleet that entered Sydney Harbour to mark the 75th anniversary of the RAN. Prior to the ceremonial entry, &quot;Success&quot; and two other replenishment ships (one United States Navy, one Royal Navy) were tasked with replenishing the assembled fleet: a competition between the three ships saw &quot;Success&quot; replenish more vessels than the other two.
&quot;Success&quot; formed part of the Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War. The ship was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 19 September to 28 October 1999. Although not recognised at the time, an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, saw &quot;Success&quot; granted the honours &quot;Kuwait 1991&quot; and &quot;East Timor 1999&quot; for these deployments.

In 2005, &quot;Success&quot; was one of several Australian warships to participate in Exercise Talisman Sabre 2005, a series of joint RAN-USN war games.

During 2006, &quot;Success&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian response to the 2006 East Timorese crisis. In late November 2006, &quot;Success&quot; was one of three Australian warships sent to Fiji during the leadup to the 2006 coup d&#x27;état by Fijian military forces against Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. &quot;Success&quot; joined HMA Ships and ; the other two ships having sailed in the first week of November. The three vessels were to be used in the event of an evacuation of Australian citizens and nationals, but not as a military force. The task group was stood down in late December 2006, with all three ships returning to port.

On 20 February 2007, &quot;Success&quot; intercepted a boat carrying 85 Sri Lankan asylum seekers. These were the last asylum seekers to be processed under the Pacific Solution policy before its cancellation.
&quot;Success&quot; was deployed as part of Operation Resolute for three months in 2008. While assigned to Resolute, the vessel was deployed with several other RAN vessels to take part in RIMPAC 08, a multi-national naval exercise. During RIMPAC, on the night of 23 July, &quot;Success&quot; completed her 3,000th replenishment at sea (RAS) during a dual-replenishment of (port side, 2,999th RAS) and (starboard side, 3,000th RAS).

On the morning of 13 March 2009, &quot;Success&quot; was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The replenishment ship was one of the thirteen vessels involved in the ceremonial entry through Sydney Heads, and anchored in the harbour for the review.

In May 2009, while &quot;Success&quot; was on exercise in South-East Asia, the ship&#x27;s commanding officer was alerted to an alleged sex gambling game aboard, which challenged male sailors to record their sexual activities with female sailors in a &#x27;ledger&#x27;, and awarded them prize money based on with whom or where they had sex. This was one of several incidents during the three-month deployment; two bars in Manila were damaged during shore leave, while at another bar in Qingdao, several sailors were involved in a public sex act. Three male sailors were removed from &quot;Success&quot; when the ship docked in Singapore, and were sent back to Australia to participate in a formal inquiry; this inquiry was found to be flawed because of bias and the denial of support to the three accused, and a second, independent inquiry was set up under former judge Roger Gyles in February 2010. The first part of Gyles&#x27; inquiry report was released in February 2011, which stated that there was an entrenched culture of sexual harassment, bullying, and predatory sexual behaviour towards female sailors, coupled with alcohol-fuelled misconduct, particularly amongst the male sailors of the ship&#x27;s marine engineering department. Gyles found that although the harassment and misconduct had been occurring as early as 2004, failures to respond to earlier complaints led to a breakdown in discipline aboard &quot;Success&quot;. The former judge was unable to prove the existence of the claimed ledger, but found many of the other claims to be correct, including evidence that male sailors had placed bets around having sex with a particular female sailor.
At the end of 2009, the Department of Defence released a request for tender for modification of &quot;Success&quot; into a double hull vessel, allowing her to meet International Maritime Organization standards for oil tankers. The tender was awarded to Singapore-based ST Marine (a subsidiary of ST Engineering), with the conversion to be made during 2011. The ship sailed to Singapore in November for a naval exercise, after which she was to enter dock for the 14-week conversion, but problems in the contract delayed the dockyard start date, and &quot;Success&quot; was ordered back to Sydney, via in Western Australia, so the ship&#x27;s company could take leave with family while the contract was finalised. Work on the ship started in late December 2010, with the main conversion work completed by the end of April 2011. In May 2011, a civilian contractor working on the ship died after falling overboard. &quot;Success&quot; left Singapore in late May, and returned to Sydney.

&quot;Success&quot; underwent a major refit for most of 2013. During this time, the Spanish oiler was deployed to Australian waters to operate in support of RAN assets, while providing the opportunity to train Australian personnel on systems similar to those in the Spanish-designed &quot;Hobart&quot;- and &quot;Canberra&quot;-class ships being acquired. In October 2013, &quot;Success&quot; participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney. In late 2013, the ship was the testbed for flight trials of the MRH 90 helicopter.

In March 2014, &quot;Success&quot; was deployed to assist in efforts to locate and retrieve possible wreckage from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that had been detected on satellite images of the southern Indian Ocean. In late November 2014, &quot;Success&quot; deployed to the Middle East for a six-month period to provide logistic support to coalition naval units as part of Operation Manitou, replacing the Australian frigate usually deployed in the region.

In February 2015, &quot;Success&quot; was awarded the Gloucester Cup for 2014, marking the ship as the most proficient in the RAN for that year.

==Fate==

The Australian Department of Defence predicted in 2006 that &quot;Success&quot; would reach the end of her useful operational lifespan sometime between 2015 and 2017. Following her double-hull refit, this was extended to the early 2020s, with the decision on the replacement vessel (acquisition project SEA 1654 Phase 3) to be made between 2016 and 2018, and the new ship in service by 2023. The 2013 Defence White Paper stated that the replacement of &quot;Success&quot; and would be brought forward. As well as building replacement vessels (either in Australia, overseas, or a combination), leasing existing vessels was also to be considered.

In June 2014, the Minister for Defence announced that two companies had been invited to a restricted tender competition. Navantia from Spain offered the design, while Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering from Korea proposed a downsized Aegir variant of the &quot;Tide&quot;-class tanker. The 20,000+ tonne ships will be built overseas, as they will be too large to build in Australian shipyards. In March 2016, the Navantia design was selected.

&quot;Success&quot; completed her final voyage into Sydney Harbour on 16 June 2019. She was decommissioned at Fleet Base East on 29 June 2019. Her replacement is , a &quot;Supply&quot;-class replenishment oiler. This ship was commissioned in 2021.

&quot;Success&quot; arrived in Port Pirie in early August 2019. The ship was stripped to the hull by local engineering firm McMahon Services and the hull then moved to Whyalla, to a slipway that was once part of the former shipyards, where it was broken up for scrap.

<doc id="429346" wikidata="Q3556484" url="?curid=429346" title="Florida Legislature">
<text>The Florida Legislature is the legislature of the U.S. state of Florida. It is organized as a bicameral body composed of an upper chamber, the Senate, and a lower chamber, the House of Representatives. Article III, Section 1 of the Florida Constitution, adopted in 1968, defines the role of the legislature and how it is to be constituted. The legislature is composed of 160 state legislators (120 in the House and 40 in the Senate). The primary purpose of the legislature is to enact new laws and amend or repeal existing laws. It meets in the Florida State Capitol building in Tallahassee.

==Florida Senate==

The Senate is the upper house of the state legislature. As of 2024, Republicans hold the majority in the Senate with 28 seats; Democrats are in the minority with 11 seats. One seat is vacant.

==Florida House of Representatives==

The House of Representatives is the lower house of the state legislature. As of January 2025, Republicans hold the majority in the House of Representatives with 86 seats, and Democrats hold 33 seats. One seat is vacant.

==Terms==
===Senate===
All terms were truncated again in 2016, with all 40 Senate seats up for election, due to court-ordered redistricting.

=== House of Representatives ===
Members of the House of Representatives are elected for terms of two years in each even-numbered year.

===Term limits===
In 1992, voters passed Amendment 9 to amend the State Constitution to limit federal and state officials to eight-year terms. In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could not enact congressional term limits.

==Qualifications==
Florida legislators must be at least twenty-one years old, an elector and resident of their district, and must have resided in Florida for at least two years before an election.

==Legislative session==
===Regular legislative sessions===
The Florida Legislature meets in a 60-day regular legislative session each year. Regular legislative sessions in odd-numbered years must begin on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March and on the second Tuesday after the first Monday in January of each even-numbered year.

Before 1991, the regular legislative session began in April. Senate Joint Resolution 380 (1989) proposed to the voters a constitutional amendment (approved November 1990) that shifted the starting date of regular legislative session from April to February. Subsequently, Senate Joint Resolution 2606 (1994) proposed to the voters a constitutional amendment (approved November 1994) shifting the start date to March, where it remains. In recent years, the legislature has opted to start in January to allow lawmakers to be home with their families during school spring breaks, and to give more time ahead of the legislative elections in the Fall.

===Special legislative sessions===
Special legislative sessions may be called by the governor, by a joint proclamation of the Senate president and House speaker, or by a three-fifths vote of all legislators. During any special session, the legislature may only address legislative business that is within the purview of the purpose or purposes stated in the special session proclamation.

==Powers and process==

The Florida Legislature is authorized by the Florida Constitution to create and amend the laws of the state of Florida, subject to the governor&#x27;s power to veto legislation. To do so, legislators propose legislation in the forms of bills drafted by a nonpartisan, professional staff. Successful legislation must undergo committee review, three readings on the floor of each house, with appropriate voting majorities, as required, and either be signed into law by the governor or enacted through a veto override approved by two-thirds of the membership of each legislative house.

Its statutes, called &quot;chapter laws&quot; or generically as &quot;slip laws&quot; when printed separately, are compiled into the &quot;Laws of Florida&quot; and are called &quot;session laws&quot;. The &quot;Florida Statutes&quot; are the codified statutory laws of the state.

In 2009, legislators filed 2,138 bills for consideration. On average, the legislature has passed about 300 bills into law annually.

In 2013, the legislature filed about 2,000 bills. About 1,000 of these were &quot;member bills.&quot; The remainder are bills by committees responsible for certain functions, such as the budget. In 2016, about 15% of the bills were passed. In 2017, 1,885 lobbyists registered to represent 3,724 entities.

The legislature also has the power to propose amendments to the Florida Constitution.

==Leadership==

The House of Representatives is headed by the speaker of the House, while the Senate is headed by the Senate president. The House speaker and Senate president control the assignment of committees and leadership positions, along with control of the agenda in their chambers. The two leaders, along with the governor of Florida, control most of the agenda of state business in Florida.

<doc id="429348" wikidata="Q5012157" url="?curid=429348" title="CJON-DT">
<text>CJON-DT (channel 21), branded on-air as NTV (short for Newfoundland Television), is an independent television station in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, owned by Newfoundland Broadcasting Company Ltd. The station&#x27;s studios are located on Logy Bay Road in St. John&#x27;s, and its transmitter is located in the city&#x27;s Shea Heights section.

==History==
In 1955, Newfoundland Broadcasting Company Ltd., owner of CJON radio, applied for and received a licence for the first television station in Newfoundland. Newfoundland Broadcasting was jointly owned by Geoff Stirling and Don Jamieson. The station went on the air later that year on September 6, as a CBC Television affiliate. It was Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s first television station, and remains the province&#x27;s only privately owned television station to this day. Stirling has contended that this was the only group willing to invest in such a station, although other sources have suggested that Stirling and Jamieson used their political connections to prevent the CBC from opening its own station in Newfoundland first. This scenario is somewhat unlikely because until 1958, the CBC was both the primary broadcast regulator in Canada and a broadcaster in its own right, the former role taken over in 1958 by the independent Board of Broadcast Governors (the forerunner of the CRTC). However, the CBC-owned CBYT in Corner Brook launched soon after, in 1959. When it began operations, CJON&#x27;s first studios and offices were located at the Prince of Wales Building in Buckmaster&#x27;s Circle and the transmitter on Kenmount Road.

In any event, the CBC launched CBNT in 1964, and CJON became an affiliate of the new CTV network. During the mid-1970s, it was known as &quot;NBC&quot;, for the &quot;Newfoundland Broadcasting Company&quot;, until 1978 when WLBZ-TV, the Bangor affiliate of the U.S.-based National Broadcasting Company, became available on cable (to be replaced later by WDIV-TV from Detroit, then WHDH from Boston and eventually WBTS-LD/CD also from Boston). To avoid confusion, CJON was rebranded as &quot;NTV&quot;, although as late as August 1978, the Newfoundland Herald&#x27;s TV listings continued to refer to NTV as NBC, including listing the local newscasts under the title &quot;NBC News&quot;.

In 1972, CJON became one of the first television stations in Canada, if not &quot;the&quot; first, to broadcast around the clock every night (see &quot;Overnight programming&quot;, below). In 1977, Stirling and Jamieson unwound their partnership, with Jamieson taking the AM radio stations, with CJON radio being renamed CJYQ. In later years, many of the AM stations were eventually sold, and in several cases shut down. Stirling kept NTV and the newly launched station CHOZ-FM. 1983 saw CJON and CHOZ&#x27;s operations move to their present building on Logy Bay Road, with a new transmitter on the South Side Hills.

==Programming==
===1988 to 2002===
Until the fall of 1992, CTV programming made up a clear majority of NTV&#x27;s schedule, although acquired programming from CanWest Global and others was present. However, from 1992 on, when CTV reduced its programming to 40 hours per week, NTV suddenly became much more reliant on other broadcasters, primarily CanWest (which owned the Canadian rights to many dominant programs of the era such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;), but also Baton Broadcasting and WIC. Instead of relying on any one group, it took what it considered the best programming from all the groups, even after the Baton/CTV merger strengthened the CTV schedule considerably.

During this period, and indeed well before, NTV consistently aired hours of prime time programming each night, a great deal of them being American imports, from 8 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. NT (11 p.m. ET), as opposed to the North American norm of three hours. In fact, in 1995–96, first-run prime time programming began at 7:30 p.m. and ran until 12:30 a.m. Although the net result was less than the mandated 50% Canadian content between 6 p.m. and midnight, this was not deemed to violate Cancon regulations as &quot;CTV National News&quot; did not feed an 11 p.m. AT edition until 1998, although the practice was maintained without CRTC complaint until disaffiliation in 2002.

===2002 to present===
For almost four decades, CJON had aired the base CTV schedule essentially for free since CTV paid it for the airtime. It then bought additional CTV programming for which it sold all advertising. However, in early 2002, CTV tried to make CJON pay for the base schedule as well, with no possibility of airtime payments. It also increased the fees for additional CTV programming beyond what CJON claimed it could pay. Newfoundland Broadcasting also did not want to continue to carry CTV&#x27;s national advertising during these programs. Rather than agree to these terms, CJON disaffiliated from CTV at the end of the 2001–02 season.

As of fall 2002, NTV lost access to most CTV programming, but maintained rights to &quot;CTV National News&quot;, &quot;Canada AM&quot;, and other CTV news programming free of charge, on the condition that it continue to provide coverage of Newfoundland and Labrador events for CTV and CTV News Channel. Additionally, it purchased rights to additional CTV programming, such as &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, on an individual, per-season basis (&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; aired on NTV in its first season but not afterward, and currently no CTV entertainment programming appears regularly on NTV; until 2006, some other CTV-owned properties such as the Academy Awards and the Juno Awards continued to air on NTV, but all have recently been dropped, although the Juno Awards have since reappeared on NTV as of 2009).

Most of NTV&#x27;s entertainment programming since 2002 has been received via to a program supply agreement with the Global Television Network; for example, &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. NTV&#x27;s last public comment on the arrangement, at a CRTC hearing in 2002, was to the effect that it would expire at the end of the 2005–2006 season. However, with the addition of new Global programs to the NTV schedule during the spring and summer of 2006, all indications are that the agreement has been extended.

Unlike most Canadian stations, which fill essentially all of their unsold commercial airtime with program promotions or public service announcements, NTV frequently uses minute-long clips of music videos, usually at the end of a commercial break, in addition to its promos and public service announcements. Video usage has recently been relaxed, at least during parts of the regular broadcast day, with the addition of high-rotation news and weather updates of up to two minutes duration. However, music videos remain common during the overnight hours.

===Local programming===
As with many local stations in North America, non-news local programming was common in the station&#x27;s early days but had decreased significantly by the 1990s. Since 2002, perhaps given the recent ratings dominance of CTV over Global (NTV&#x27;s chief programming supplier), NTV has attempted to distinguish itself further through additional local programming, mainly from independent local producers. It also airs repeats of programs from the NTV archives, most frequently the retrospective series &quot;A Little Good News&quot; (later renamed &quot;NTV.ca&quot;), news program &quot;Canada in View&quot; (on Mondays), and speeches from Geoff Stirling during &quot;Captain Atlantis Late Night&quot; (on Saturdays).

===Overnight programming===
NTV&#x27;s overnight schedule (between 1 and 6 a.m.) generally consists of &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; or &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; followed by reruns and overflow programming unable to be accommodated in prime time. The overnight block then concludes with &quot;Scenes of Newfoundland&quot;, a full half-hour or hour dedicated to scenes of the province with traditional music from local artists playing in the background.

On Saturdays, the channel shows a two-hour block of freeform programming under the banner of &quot;Captain Atlantis Late Night&quot;. This block usually consists of speeches and interviews involving Stirling or longtime Newfoundland Premier Joey Smallwood, but has also included content such as American patriotic montages, recut Elvis Presley television specials, holiday movies and specials, and miscellanea. As of 2021, &quot;Captain Atlantis&quot; (named after an ancient alien astronaut character Stirling created) airs in the early Saturday graveyard slot, and on Saturday mornings.

==News operation==
CJON presently broadcasts 16 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with three hours each weekday and one hour on Sundays); the station does not broadcast any news programs on Saturdays.

It has frequently been promoted as &quot;the award-winning NTV Evening Newshour&quot;, in reference to a RTNDA Canada &quot;Best Newscast – Medium Market&quot; award from 1998 (for a newscast aired in 1997), and several other awards for individual reports received since. Overall, CBNT has won more RTNDA and AJA awards over the same period, and is the most recent area station to have won an RTNDA Best Newscast award, winning in 2009.

Repackaged versions of the &quot;Newshour&quot; air at midnight and at 6 a.m. the following day. &quot;NTV Newsday&quot;, a live newscast that airs weekdays at noon, frequently also relies on content from the previous night&#x27;s &quot;Newshour&quot;. NTV&#x27;s newscasts are also seen on at least one television station in the United States—WZRA-CD (channel 48), an ethnic station in Tampa, Florida, has regularly carried NTV&#x27;s newscasts as well as select CTV programming. In fact, NTV&#x27;s website promotes the fact that NTV advertisers can reach Tampa viewers through WZRA, although the station&#x27;s signal is only received well in northwestern parts of Tampa (WZRA is licensed to Oldsmar, Florida, a northwestern suburb of Tampa).

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
In a rarity for a Canadian television station, CJON&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
In May 2011, CJON announced plans to broadcast in digital and in high definition. The analog transmitter serving the St. John&#x27;s viewing area was shut off on the morning of July 11, 2011, in order to facilitate installation of the new digital HD transmitter. CJON began transmitting its digital signal on August 3, 2011, broadcasting on UHF channel 21. CJON has opted to use channel 21, its actual digital channel, as its virtual channel, instead of channel 6, its former analog channel.

===Retransmitters===
The station once operated a network of retransmitters across the province. These transmitters were all analog and never converted to digital. Beginning in the 1990s, transmitters in smaller communities were shut down or spun off to community-based groups. More transmitters were shut down from 2006 to 2013.

The station&#x27;s transmitters in Swift Current (CJSC-TV channel 10), Glenwood (CHSG-TV channel 7), and St. Alban&#x27;s (CJST-TV channel 13) were shut down as of December 31, 2006; transmitters in Bay Bulls (CJON-TV-4 channel 10) and Lawn (CJLN-TV channel 10) were shut down as of November 2011.

On November 30, 2012, transmitters at Red Rocks (CJRR-TV channel 11) and Stephenville (CJSV-TV channel 4) were shut down; the station cited the age of the towers and the costs of the upkeep. The station also announced that their transmitter network would eventually close down in the coming years, due to the high cost of upkeep. Deleted concurrently with CJRR and CJSV was the transmitter at Grand Bank (CJOX-TV-1 channel 2), which left the air in September 2012 following the failure of its transmitter; NTV also chose to close CJOX-1 instead of repairing it.

On July 31, 2013, the remaining over-the-air retransmitters of NTV in Corner Brook, Deer Lake, Norris Arm, Bonavista, Clarenville, Argentia, and Marystown were discontinued. Coupled with the closure of the CBC&#x27;s analog repeater network in 2012, the St. John&#x27;s area is the only part of the province that does not need a cable or satellite subscription for &quot;over-the-air&quot; TV. However, few Newfoundlanders lost access to NTV due to the high penetration of cable and satellite in the province.

===Internet===
NTV streams all of its local newscasts live through its website, with no geographic restrictions. The live Internet feed previously carried some of the American syndicated programs; these were dropped in September 2018. It has never carried network programming on the online feed. During times when it is not carrying local news, the NTV online feed simulcasts sister station CHOZ-FM, accompanied by webcam shots overlooking St. John&#x27;s. In 2022, CJON launched the NTV+ app, which carries programming from NTV as well as CHOZ-FM.

<doc id="429349" wikidata="Q2107964" url="?curid=429349" title="Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D">
<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D is a low-bypass (0.96 to 1) turbofan engine introduced by Pratt &amp; Whitney in February 1963 with the inaugural flight of the Boeing 727. It was a modification of the Pratt &amp; Whitney J52 turbojet engine which powered the US Navy A-6 Intruder and A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft. Eight models comprise the JT8D standard engine family, covering the thrust range from 12,250 to 17,400 pounds-force (54 to 77 kN), and power the 727, 737-100/200, and DC-9. The updated JT8D-200 family, covering the 18,900 to 21,000 pounds-force (84 to 93 kN), powers the MD-80 and re-engined Super 27 aircraft. The JT8D was built under license in Sweden as the Volvo RM8, a redesigned afterburning derivative for the Saab 37 Viggen fighter. Pratt &amp; Whitney also sells static versions for powerplant and ship propulsion as the FT8.

==Design==

The JT8D is an axial-flow front turbofan engine incorporating a two-spool design. There are two coaxially-mounted independent rotating assemblies: one rotating assembly for the low pressure compressor (LPC) which consists of the first six stages (i.e. six pairs of rotating and stator blades, including the first two stages which are for the bypass turbofan), driven by the second (downstream) turbine (which consists of three stages); and a second rotating assembly for the high-pressure compressor (HPC) section, which has seven stages. The high-pressure compressor is driven by the first (upstream) turbine, which has a single stage.

The front-mounted bypass fan has two stages. The annular discharge duct for the bypass fan runs along the full length of the engine, so that both the fan air and exhaust gases can exit through the same nozzle. This arrangement allows some noise attenuation, in that the still-hot fast-moving turbine exhaust is shrouded in much-cooler and slower-moving air (from the bypass fan) before interacting with ambient air. Thus, the JT8D noise levels were significantly reduced from previous non-turbofan engines, although the low bypass ratio meant that, compared to subsequently developed turbofans, high noise levels were still produced.

Within the fan inlet case, there are anti-icing air bosses and probes to sense the inlet pressure and temperature. Similar units exist throughout the engine to check temperatures and pressures.

At the 13th (i.e. the final) compressor stage, air is bled out and used for anti-icing. The amount is controlled by the Pressure Ratio Bleed Control sense signal (PRBC). The &quot;diffuser case&quot; at the aft end of the compressor houses the 13th stage. Its increasing cross-sectional area allows the compressed air to slow down before entering one of the engine&#x27;s nine burner cans. Again, there are two bosses to extract 13th stage air for anti-icing, de-icing of fuel, and airframe (cabin pressurization) use. Not all the compressed air enters the burner cans at the fuel-ignition point; some bypasses the can completely and cools the first turbine stage, and some is gradually introduced into the burner can&#x27;s perimeter in such a way that the burning fuel is held near the can&#x27;s centerline.

There are nine combustion chambers positioned in a can-annular arrangement. Each chamber has three air inlet hole sizes: the smallest is for cooling, the medium is for burning and the largest for forming an air blanket.
===Update programs===
In response to environmental concerns that began in the 1970s, the company began developing a new version of the engine, the JT8D-200 series. Designed to be quieter, cleaner, more efficient, yet more powerful than earlier models, the -200 Series power-plant was re-engineered with a significantly higher bypass ratio (1.74 to 1) covering the 18,500 to 21,700 pound-force (82 to 97 kN) thrust range and powering the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series. This increase was achieved by increasing bypass fan diameter from to and reducing fan pressure ratio (from 2.21 to 1.92). Overall engine pressure ratio was also increased from 15.4 to 21.0. Since entering service in 1980, more than 2,900 of the -200 series engines have been produced.

The JT8D-217 and -219 engine(s) were tested in 2001 and were deemed suitable replacements for the old TF33 engines on military and commercial aircraft as part of the Super 27 re-engining program. The updated engines offer reduced (Stage-3) noise compliance standards without the need for hush kits, enhanced short field performance, and steeper and faster climb rates with roughly a 10% reduction in fuel burn for extended range.

Pratt &amp; Whitney, in a joint venture with Seven Q Seven (SQS) and Omega Air, developed the JT8D-219 as a re-engine powerplant for Boeing 707-based aircraft. Northrop Grumman used the -219 to re-engine one of the United States Air Force&#x27;s fleet of 19 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (E-8 Joint STARS) aircraft, which would allow the JSTARS more time on station due to the engine&#x27;s 17% greater fuel efficiency. However these plans were cancelled after the single conversion when the decision was taken to retire the platform. NATO originally planned to re-engine their fleet of E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft, however again this was cancelled after the decision was taken to retire the E-3 platform in preference for the E-7 Wedgetail. The -219 is publicized as being half the cost of the competing 707 re-engine powerplant, the CFM International CFM56, for reasons of geometrical and balance similarity to the engine it is replacing and the associated relative up-front wing modification costs of the two choices.

The proposed Aerion SBJ supersonic business jet, previously under development, was to use a pair of JT8D-219 engines for sustained supersonic flight.

==Variants==


==Production==
More than 14,000 JT8D engines have been produced, totaling more than one-half billion hours of service, with more than 350 operators, making it the most popular of all low-bypass turbofan engines ever produced. Regular production ended in 1985, but some replacement engines were produced for military aircraft in 2011. Mainline airline use of the JT8D continued until 2020 when Delta Air Lines retired their MD-88 fleet early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Accidents==

;18 January 1969:United Air Lines Flight 266 – ten minutes after takeoff, the cockpit received a warning from Engine 1 of an engine fire and cut off power to that engine. A minute later, Flight UA266 suffered a total loss of electrical power, which disabled the aircraft&#x27;s flight instruments. At 13 minutes after take-off, the plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean, just 12 miles off the coast, killing all 38 people aboard the aircraft, which consisted of 32 passengers and 6 crew members.
;4 April 1977:Southern Airways Flight 242 – both engines on the DC-9 failed when the pilots flew into a severe thunderstorm after misreading their onboard radar. The flight encountered severe rain and hail. The NTSB concluded that the &quot;loss of thrust was caused by the ingestion of massive amounts of water and hail which in combination with thrust lever movement induced severe stalling in and major damage to the engine compressors&quot;. Some 63 people on board and 9 on the ground died as a result of the accident.
;22 August 1985:British Airtours Flight 28M – an engine failed during take-off from Manchester Airport and a fire spread into the cabin, resulting in 55 fatalities aboard the Boeing 737-236 Advanced.
;6 September 1985:Midwest Express Flight 105 – the NTSB concluded that an unconfined failure of the 9th - 10th stage compressor spacer occurred immediately after takeoff from Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport (then called Billy Mitchell Field). The plane was observed to have slowed significantly as a result of the engine loss and experienced an accelerated stall condition. The plane rolled to the right 90 degrees and crashed just south of the runway, resulting in 31 fatalities (all passengers and crew) aboard the McDonnell-Douglas DC-9 aircraft.
;3 May 1991:Ryan Airlines – unconfined failure of 9th stage compressor disc penetrated fuel lines and fuselage on the tarmac at Bradley International Airport causing fire and complete loss of aircraft. No fatalities reported.
;27 December 1991:Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751 – the engines on an MD-81 ingested wing ice during takeoff causing engine damage that led to a total loss of thrust on both engines. The aircraft crashed in a forest clearing with no fatalities.
;6 July 1996:An engine explosion happened on an MD-88, Delta Air Lines Flight 1288, just prior to take-off at Pensacola, Florida, USA, with two fatalities.
;6 March 2003:A 737-200 operated by Air Algérie crashed due to sudden loss of thrust as a result of the left engine&#x27;s fan blades fracturing and the captain taking controls off of the first officer without assessing or mentally preparing for the situation.

<text>HMAS &quot;Swordsman&quot; (H11) was an Admiralty S-class destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built for the Royal Navy during World War I, the ship was not completed until 1919, and was transferred to the RAN at the start of 1920. The destroyer&#x27;s career was uneventful, with most of it spent moored in Sydney. &quot;Swordsman&quot; was decommissioned in 1929, and scuttled off Sydney in 1939.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Swordsman&quot; was built to the Admiralty design of the S class destroyer, which was designed and built as part of the British emergency war programme. The destroyer had a displacement of 1,075 tons, a length of overall and between perpendiculars, and a beam of . The propulsion machinery consisted of three Yarrow boilers feeding Brown-Curtis turbines, which supplied to the ship&#x27;s two propeller shafts. &quot;Swordsman&quot; had a maximum speed of , and a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company was made up of 6 officers and 93 sailors.

The destroyer&#x27;s primary armament consisted of three QF 4-inch Mark IV guns. These were supplemented by a 2-pounder pom-pom, two 9.5-inch howitzer bomb throwers, five .303 inch machine guns (a mix of Lewis and Maxim guns), two twin 21-inch torpedo tube sets, two depth charge throwers, and two depth charge chutes.

&quot;Swordsman&quot; was laid down by Scott&#x27;s Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at their Greenock shipyard in 1917. The destroyer was launched on 28 December 1918, and completed during March 1919. In June 1919, the destroyer was marked for transfer to the RAN, along with four sister ships. &quot;Swordsman&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 27 January 1920.

==Operational history==
After arriving in Australian waters, the majority of &quot;Swordsman&quot;″s career was spent moored in Sydney.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Swordsman&quot; was paid off into reserve on 21 December 1929. She was sold to Penguins Limited of Balmain, New South Wales for ship breaking on 4 June 1937. Her hull (with engines removed) was scuttled off Sydney on 8 February 1939 in location .

<text>HMAS &quot;Tasmania&quot; (H25) was an Admiralty S class destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built for the Royal Navy during World War I, the ship was not completed until 1919, and spent a year commissioned but not operational in British service before being transferred to the RAN at the start of 1920. The destroyer&#x27;s career was uneventful, with almost all of it spent in Australian waters. &quot;Tasmania&quot; was decommissioned in 1930, and was sold for ship breaking in 1937.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Tasmania&quot; was built to the Admiralty design of the S-class destroyer, which was designed and built as part of the British emergency war programme. The destroyer had a displacement of 1,075 tons, a length overall of , and a beam of . The propulsion machinery consisted of three Yarrow boilers feeding Brown-Curtis turbines, which supplied to the ship&#x27;s two propeller shafts. Although designed with a maximum speed of , &quot;Tasmania&quot; was only able to achieve on power trails. The destroyer&#x27;s economical speed of gave her a range of . The ship&#x27;s company was made up of 6 officers and 93 sailors.

The destroyer&#x27;s primary armament consisted of three QF 4-inch Mark IV guns. These were supplemented by a 2-pounder pom-pom, two 9.5-inch howitzer bomb throwers, five .303 inch machine guns (a mix of Lewis and Maxim guns), two twin 21-inch torpedo tube sets, two depth charge throwers, and two depth charge chutes.

&quot;Tasmania&quot; was laid down by William Beardmore and Company, Limited, at Dalmuir in Scotland on 18 December 1917. The destroyer was launched on 22 November 1918, and completed on 22 January 1919. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy in January 1919, but was not made operational, and was marked for transfer to the RAN, along with four sister ships. &quot;Tasmania&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 27 January 1920.

==Operational history==
&quot;Tasmania&quot; and three of her sister ships sailed for Australia on 20 February, visiting ports in the Mediterranean, India, Singapore, and the Netherlands East Indies before reaching Sydney on 29 April. &quot;Tasmania&quot; was primarily used for training, and apart from a visit to New Guinea in 1924, remained in Australian waters.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Tasmania&quot; paid off into reserve on 9 January 1928. She was sold to Penguins Limited for ship breaking on 4 June 1937.

<doc id="429356" wikidata="Q3502680" url="?curid=429356" title="Simultaneous substitution">
<text>Simultaneous substitution (also known as simsubbing or signal substitution) is a practice mandated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) requiring broadcast distribution undertakings (BDUs) in Canada to distribute the signal of a local or regional over-the-air station in place of the signal of a foreign or non-local television station (typically one that is affiliated with a U.S. commercial television network such as ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), when the two stations are broadcasting identical programming simultaneously.

The CRTC first introduced the policy in 1972, and it is sometimes erroneously called &quot;simulcasting&quot;, the name of a practice different from simultaneous substitution in that there is no signal replacement. According to the CRTC, the practice of simultaneous substitution is necessary &quot;to protect the rights of broadcasters, to enable television stations to draw enough advertising revenue and to keep advertising money in the Canadian market&quot;. Canadian broadcast networks, which must request each and every substitution on an individual basis, have been criticized for exploiting the regulation and not investing enough money into Canadian content.

The most prominent public criticism of simsubs has been centred around the Super Bowl—the championship game of the National Football League—which is well known for featuring high-profile commercials on its U.S. broadcast. In 2015, citing the ads as having become an &quot;integral part&quot; of the broadcast, the CRTC announced that it would implement a policy to prevent broadcasters from requesting simsubs for the game; it was officially implemented prior to Super Bowl LI in 2017. This has faced criticism over the change in policy from the game&#x27;s Canadian rightsholder, CTV owner Bell Media; the company argued that it singled out a specific program for policy in violation of the Broadcasting Act, and devalued its rights to the league. Bell Media subsequently fought this policy in court, and it was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada on December 19, 2019.

==History==
During the 1950s, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) had a monopoly on television broadcasting in Canada (its first television station, CBFT, began operating in Montreal in 1952). In 1960, the Board of Broadcast Governors, the predecessor of the CRTC, began granting licences for commercial stations in order to provide an alternative to the CBC. These broadcasters began operating in 1961, and through international distributors, acquired the domestic broadcast rights to many American television programs.

Since about 30% of the Canadian population – those who resided close enough to the Canada–US border – had access to over-the-air broadcast signals from networks based in both Canada and the United States, they could choose to watch American programs on either a Canadian or an American network. Many of these Canadians chose to watch the American network (either CBS, ABC or NBC) rather than the Canadian networks&#x27; broadcasts. Consequently, many Canadian broadcasters began broadcasting programs purchased from American-based broadcast networks before they aired on the American networks to attract more viewers and to earn money from domestic advertising, and some Canadian businesses that advertised on the domestic stations also purchased broadcast time on the American stations that were receivable in the same areas, although federal legislation was eventually passed that limited the tax-deductibility of these purchases.

Several of the stations in smaller border markets in the United States openly targeted the larger cities in Canada by getting as close to the border as possible. Examples include most of the stations in the Buffalo, New York television market, which targeted Toronto and the Golden Horseshoe region, and in the most extreme case, Pembina, North Dakota, station KCND-TV (channel 12), which was based in a town with fewer than 1,000 residents but made its money by targeting the much larger city of Winnipeg across the border to its north.

When cable television began to proliferate across Canada in the early-1970s, viewers far from the Canada–US border began to obtain access to American television services that were once unobtainable. In 1972, in response to pressure from Canadian broadcasters, the CRTC introduced the simultaneous substitution regulation as a method to circumvent diminution of the value of Canadian networks&#x27; exclusive broadcast rights to American programs (within three years, KCND was effectively moved to Winnipeg and relicensed as CKND-TV). Through the 1990s, as direct-broadcast satellite television services gained popularity and then were granted licences in Canada, simultaneous substitution became a requirement on these as well.

By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the simultaneous substitution regulation had reached its full potential, with Canadian broadcast networks telecasting nearly all of their American programming at the same time as the U.S. network&#x27;s broadcasts to ensure maximum eligibility to request substitution.

==Effects==
The high incidence of simultaneous substitution requests by privately owned Canadian television networks to draw advertising revenue has had profound effects on various spectrums, ranging from Canadian network schedules to portions of programming being lost due to mistimed substitutions.

===Network schedules===
Since private Canadian broadcast networks such as CTV, Global, CTV 2, and Citytv often rely heavily on American programs, their programming schedules are often effectively dictated by the schedules of corresponding United States network broadcasters. For example, if a U.S. broadcaster moves a series to a new time slot, the Canadian broadcaster that holds domestic rights to carry first-run episodes of that program would need to move its broadcast to correspond with the new time slot if it wished to exercise its simultaneous substitution rights.
Many American networks telecast their most popular programming during prime time, meaning that in order to maximize simsubbing opportunities, Canadian private broadcasters are often unable or unwilling to broadcast their own original programming during these hours. As a result, Canadian content programming is commonly scheduled as a secondary concern, to fill holes where an American program cannot be placed for substitution. This issue has also extended beyond scripted entertainment programming – all three major networks in Canada have faced criticism for at least one incident in which the network seemingly deemed a live Canadian news or cultural awards program to be less important than simsubbing an American reality television series:
* In 2006, CBC Television received criticism after it announced plans to bump its primary network newscast, &quot;The National&quot;, to a later time slot one night a week to broadcast the short-lived singing competition series &quot;The One: Making a Music Star&quot;.
* In 2007, CTV was forced to back down on a plan to tape-delay the 2007 Juno Awards to maintain its simsubbing rights to an episode of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;.

Since 2008, CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media) has held both the exclusive rights to the Canadian Football League and the rights to Sunday afternoon and playoff games of the American National Football League, broadcasting most NFL games on CTV, while relegating CFL games (including the Grey Cup) to cable channel TSN, making CFL games unavailable on broadcast television for the first time in Canadian history. The move was in part due to the desire to gain simsubbing rights over the NFL broadcasts, something that was not necessary for CFL games because, as of 2015, those games are only available on cable television in the United States.

===Portions of programming lost===
Due to the high number of simultaneous substitutions requested by Canadian broadcasters, portions of programs are sometimes lost. This may occur for a variety of reasons, including the cable provider erroneously timing the substitution or substituting over the incorrect distant signal, the Canadian broadcaster making a scheduling error when requesting a substitution, the American broadcaster making a last minute change to its schedule, or adverse weather conditions sometimes affecting a Canadian station&#x27;s local signal. In addition, should a Canadian network interrupt its programming to provide information on a breaking news event while simsubbing an American show, the American program cannot be telecast.

With the increasingly common practice of American networks extending programs by one to two minutes into the start of the next hour in order to avoid audience loss, such errors are sometimes unavoidable if the Canadian station is not able to match the altered start time. This slight differentiation in timing between the Canadian and American stations can lead to a short period during which the Canadian viewer is watching the original American station&#x27;s signal before the Canadian network starts its simsubbing, resulting in the show&#x27;s jumping back to the start again. This is not a problem for American viewers who choose to watch the same network across time slots, but Canadian viewers could miss critical content. The timing is often rectified by tape delaying the overlaid content and forgoing a minute of ad time in the following commercial break to quickly catch back up with the American broadcast.

===High-definition television===
High-definition television signals must also be simultaneously substituted, although this only applies if a local over-the-air digital transmitter that broadcasts HD content is receivable in the market served by the local cable provider. Since many broadcasters were only required to convert their main, typically major-market transmitters during the 2011 digital television transition in Canada, this means that HD simsubbing is not currently enforceable in many rural areas.

Although the CRTC&#x27;s policy regarding simultaneous substitutions for high definition broadcasts do not require them to be applied if the quality of the Canadian feed is not equal or better than the American feed, there have been instances in which inferior Canadian feeds were substituted over higher-quality American feeds. In such cases, complaints can be filed to the CRTC, whereas the commission will confer with the applicable BDU and Canadian network about the issue.

===On-screen graphics===
Implementation of simultaneous substitutions can also cause issues involving digital on-screen graphics (e.g., a &quot;bug”) applied by the originating broadcaster; if a clean feed of the program is not available (particularly for live programming), the Canadian broadcaster will often place their own bug in a different corner of the screen, or not add one at all. CTV and CTV Two occasionally used an opaque logo to cover the logo bugs of US-based networks on simsubbed broadcasts of &quot;The View&quot; on CTV and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on CTV Two, but have since discontinued this practice.

==Implementation and exceptions==
Enforcement, or lack thereof, of the regulations, as well as legal exceptions and simple circumstance, has led to instances where some Canadian cable and satellite subscribers are able to receive the original American channels in Canada without simultaneous substitution. Cable providers with less than 2000 subscribers are not legally required to have simultaneous substitution implemented.
Many viewers in the Greater Toronto Area can pick up American stations from Buffalo, New York, over-the-air, as well as high-definition versions of the stations from both Buffalo and Seattle, Washington, on cable television. Similarly, cable television viewers in Greater Vancouver may receive unmatched HD stations from Detroit, Michigan, and Rochester, New York. However, high-definition feeds are also subject to simsub, and such substitutions began to increase as local broadcasters performed wider deployments of digital terrestrial television.

=== Rule changes and Super Bowl simsub ban ===
On January 29, 2015, the CRTC announced changes to the simsub rules as a result of &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk TV&quot;, a series of hearings which mulled reforms for the Canadian television industry. While the CRTC did not completely eliminate the simsub rules, &quot;despite certain reservations&quot;, it did propose that its policies explicitly state that only over-the-air channels may invoke simsubs, and that broadcasters and television providers be accountable for programming lost from improperly implemented simsubs: providers will be required to provide rebates as compensation, and stations could temporarily lose their ability to simsub programming. The CRTC also proposed that, citing viewer complaints over their inability to see what they felt was an &quot;integral part&quot; of the event, and that many ads were often seen multiple times throughout the game, it would ban the use of simultaneous substitution for the Super Bowl beginning in 2017, thus allowing U.S. feeds of the event and its commercials to co-exist with Canadian simulcasts. However, Bell Media, the current Canadian rightsholder to the Super Bowl through CTV, filed an appeal, arguing that the move would devalue its exclusive broadcast rights to the game, and violates the Broadcasting Act, which forbids the CRTC from making regulations that single out specific programs. The NFL itself has backed Bell Media&#x27;s complaints.

The order implementing these new rules was issued on August 19, 2016. The prohibition only applies to the game itself; the typically extended pre-game and post-game coverage is not covered by the policy, and thus may still be simsubbed by CTV. On November 2, 2016, after being denied an appeal because the CRTC had not yet issued official policy when the suit was filed, Bell was granted the right to appeal the ruling in the Federal Court of Appeal. The telecast of Super Bowl LI was available directly from Fox affiliates carried on pay television in Canada.

Michael Geist of the University of Ottawa believed that this decision was a test case for eventually phasing out the simsub rules entirely, arguing that the practice was becoming increasingly irrelevant due to changing viewing habits (such as the consumption of TV content via video-on-demand services rather than linear networks), and that dropping the rules could force domestic broadcasters to make greater investments into original, Canadian content, rather than scheduling it as an afterthought around fluctuating U.S. schedules.

On May 18, 2017, the NFL testified to the United States Department of Commerce that the CRTC&#x27;s August 2016 ruling was a violation of copyright protections under NAFTA. The NFL and BCE continued to fight to overturn this policy in the Federal Court of Appeal.

On December 19, 2017, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Bell Media&#x27;s case, ruling that the CRTC&#x27;s policy was reasonable. Bell Media once again filed for an appeal in January 2018, this time in the Supreme Court of Canada.

On May 10, 2018, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear the NFL and Bell&#x27;s appeal of the Federal Court of Appeal&#x27;s decision. In an unprecedented step, the top court announced that it intended to use this appeal as an opportunity to revisit the law governing standard of review of administrative tribunals. The appeal was tentatively scheduled to be heard in December 2018.

On October 1, 2018, Canada agreed to the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement. The trade deal, which replaces NAFTA, contains an annexe that would require the CRTC to apply its simsub policies equally across the programming that it covers, and as such, withdraw its policy forbidding simsubs of the Super Bowl. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell had lobbied for the condition, and praised U.S. president Donald Trump after the agreement was announced. Following the announcement of the trade deal, Bell requested that the CRTC withdraw the policy in time for Super Bowl LIII; Bell was denied due to the pending Supreme Court appeals hearing, as well as the fact that the agreement had not yet been ratified.

On December 19, 2019, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favour of Bell Media, arguing that the CRTC overstepped its power under the Broadcasting Act by attempting to &quot;impose terms and conditions on the distribution of programming services generally&quot;. Therefore, Super Bowl LIV in 2020 was subject to simsub.

===Specific television providers===
In terms of television providers, the practice of simsubbing is implemented in different ways, depending on the company, especially in the case of satellite providers, which operate on a national basis and not regionally as cable providers do;
* Shaw Direct invokes simsubs according to a subscriber&#x27;s postal code, and is implemented by the receiver&#x27;s firmware; this method enforces simsubs only in areas where they are legally needed. Beginning in February 2012, however, Shaw Direct began implementing simsubs for the Global network&#x27;s HD feed (channel 256) for all of their high-definition subscribers, which affects ABC East HD (WXYZ-TV), CBS East HD (WWJ-TV), Fox East HD (WUHF) and NBC East HD (WDIV-TV). It is speculated that this is due to the 2010 purchase of the Global Television Network by Shaw Communications. At first, no other channels were simsubbed; Shaw Direct later began implementing simsubs for Citytv, but it still does not do so for CTV, its main competitor.
* Bell Satellite TV invokes simsubs to all subscribers nationwide, implemented by its uplink centre (which also provides services for other service providers); by doing so, simsubs for a particular channel are implemented nationwide, regardless of where the subscriber lives or which feed the subscriber watches. Notably, Bell&#x27;s feeds also invoked simsubs on network programming being simulcast by specialty channels owned by Bell Media, such as TSN. This has since ceased due to CRTC rules that explicitly forbid this practice.
* Similarly, Rogers Cable invoked simsubs on U.S. network affiliates for sports programming simulcast on its Sportsnet specialty channels (such as the 2013 World Series on Fox in lieu of the MLB International feed). Sportsnet has since reverted to using the MLB International feed, tying into the current involvement of Sportsnet personality Buck Martinez (who serves as play-by-play commentator for Sportsnet&#x27;s regular-season broadcasts of the Toronto Blue Jays).

==Other uses==
Although simultaneous substitution was conceived to substitute the signal of a foreign station, the practice has been applied as well to substitute the signal of an out-of-market Canadian station in a given market. For example, in Montreal, the signal of Ottawa station CJOH-DT (channel 13) has frequently been substituted by the signal of locally based CFCF-DT (channel 12), even though both stations are part of the CTV network. Another example, Bell Aliant Fibe TV subscribers in Newfoundland and Labrador regularly have Global Television Network stations in Halifax and Toronto (and, very rarely, Vancouver) simsubbed with NTV; Maritime Fibe subscribers, however, often have NTV simsubbed with Global Halifax or New Brunswick, depending on where they live.

Simultaneous substitution has also been implemented on French language television stations. From the 1980s to the mid-1990s, TVA&#x27;s flagship Montreal station CFTM-TV (channel 10) had its signal substituting that of its Sherbrooke sister station CHLT-TV (channel 7) (which was receivable in the Montreal area until 1995 on cable services).

<text>Robert Gibbes Barnwell (December 21, 1761October 24, 1814) was a South Carolina slave owner, revolutionary and statesman who was a delegate to the Confederation Congress and a United States Congressman.

Barnwell was born in Beaufort in the Province of South Carolina. His education was by a private tutor after he had exhausted the resources of the Beaufort common school. But he interrupted this and entered the revolutionary war at the age of 16 as a private in the militia. In the maneuvering after the Battle of Stono Ferry, his company was camped on Johns Island in late June 1779. A British surprise attack at night cut them up badly in an action known as the Battle of Mathews&#x27; Plantation. The sixteen-year-old Barnwell was wounded so badly that they stripped his gear and left him for dead. He was found in the field by a slave and taken to his aunt (Mrs. Sarah Gibbes) on her nearby plantation. She and her daughter nursed him back to health.

== Revolutionary War ==
He returned to duty, rejoining the militia the next spring as a lieutenant. He was just in time to be included with the prisoners when General Benjamin Lincoln surrendered Charleston on May 12, 1780. He was imprisoned on the transport ship &quot;Pack Horse&quot; until his exchange in June 1781. He returned to militia service, and by the end of the war had risen to lieutenant colonel.

== Political career ==
Back home in Beaufort, Barnwell was elected to the South Carolina house of representatives for 1787-1788. He was a delegate representing South Carolina in the Confederation Congress in 1788 and 1789. He was returned to the state house for terms in 1790-1791, and 1794–1801, and in 1795, he served as speaker of that house.
In the spring of 1788, Robert was a delegate to South Carolina convention that ratified the United States Constitution. He was elected to one term in the U.S. House (1791–1793) for an at-large seat but declined to run again. Beginning in 1795, he was the chair of the board of trustees for the new Beaufort College and held that position for many years. He was elected to the state senate for 1805–1806 and was president of that body in 1805.

He died in Beaufort and is buried there in the churchyard of the St. Helena Episcopal Church. His son, Robert Woodward Barnwell, was a Senator in both the United States Senate and the Confederate Senate.

<doc id="429360" wikidata="Q1047134" url="?curid=429360" title="Buzen Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of northeastern Kyūshū, corresponding to part of southeastern Fukuoka Prefecture and northwestern Ōita Prefecture. Buzen bordered on Bungo to the south, and Chikuzen to the north and west. Its abbreviated form name was (a name which it shared with Bungo Province), although it was also called . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Buzen was one of the provinces of the Saikaidō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Buzen was ranked as one of the &quot;superior countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;far countries&quot; (遠国) in terms of distance from the capital.

==History==
===Early history===
During the Kofun period, the area of Buzen had two main power centers: Toyouni in the northwest and Usa-kuni in the southeast (the area around what is now Usa, each of which was ruled by a &quot;kuni no miyatsuko&quot;. By the Asuka period, the area had been consolidated into a single province called Toyo Province, also called &quot;Toyokuni no Michi no Shiri&quot;. After the Taika Reforms and the establishment of the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system in 701, Toyo Province was divided into Bungo and Buzen Provinces.

The &quot;kokufu&quot; of Buzen was located in Toyotsu, now part of Miyako, Fukuoka, and its ruins have been located and are now a National Historic Site. The Buzen Kokubun-ji was also located in the same area. The of &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of Buzen Province is Usa Jingū, commonly known as &quot;Usa Hachimangū&quot;, located in Usa.

===Edo Period and early modern period===
Buzen was largely dominated by Kokura Domain, ruled by the Ogasawara clan under the Tokugawa shogunate, with a smaller area under the rule of Nakatsu Domain.

During the Boshin War, Kokura Castle was occupied by the forces of Chōshū Domain, and the seat of Kokura Domain was transferred to . It was renamed in 1870. In 1869, Kokura Shinden Domain was renamed . The previous year, &quot;hatamoto&quot; territory in the province was transferred to Hita Prefecture, followed by Usa Jingu territory and Chōshū Domain in 1869. On the other hand, former &quot;tenryō&quot; in Shimoge District and Usa District became part of in January 1870. With the abolition of the han system in August 1871, the former domains became Toyotsu, Senzoku, Nakatsu, and Izuhara prefectures, which were merged at the end of the year to form Kokura Prefecture. In April 1876, Kokura Prefecture was incorporated into Fukuoka Prefecture, but in August of the same year, the two southernmost districts (Usa District and Shimoge District) of former Buzen Province were transferred to Ōita Prefecture. The name &quot;Buzen&quot; continued to persist for some purposes. For example, Buzen is explicitly recognized in the 1894 treaties with the United States and the United Kingdom.

Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation&#x27;s resources, Buzen Province had 776 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 363,940 &quot;koku&quot;. Bungo Province consisted of:

<doc id="429363" wikidata="Q6212493" url="?curid=429363" title="Joe Start">
<text>Joseph Start (October 14, 1842 – March 27, 1927), nicknamed &quot;Old Reliable&quot;, was one of the most durable regulars of baseball&#x27;s earliest era, and one of the top first basemen of his time. He began his playing career in 1859, before the formation of organized leagues and before ballplayers received payment for their services. He continued to play regularly until 1886, when he was 43. Start&#x27;s career spanned countless innovations that transformed the game in fundamental ways, but he adjusted and continued to play at a high level for almost three decades. Baseball historian Bill Ryczek said that Start &quot;was the last of the pre–Civil War players to hang up his cleats.&quot;

==Amateur era==

The New York City-born Start played first base and third base for the amateur Enterprise Club of Brooklyn from 1859 to 1861, before the advent of salaried ballplaying. After the 1861 season, he joined the powerful Atlantic Club of Brooklyn, with whom he would remain through the 1870 season. The Atlantics were undefeated in 1864 and 1865. During this decade, unofficial payment for exceptional players became common and the practice was eventually legitimized.

Start made a pivotal contribution to one of the most celebrated games of the late Amateur Era. The all-salaried Cincinnati Red Stockings had 81 consecutive wins across two seasons when they faced off against the Atlantics on June 14, 1870, at Brooklyn&#x27;s Capitoline Grounds. After nine innings, the game was even at 5-5, and the Atlantics left the field in the apparent acceptance of a tie outcome. However, the umpire ordered the teams to continue playing until the game was decided. In the top of the 11th, Cincinnati scored twice to take the lead, 7-5. In the bottom of the 11th, Atlantics third baseman Charlie Smith singled. Start then hit a booming triple, driving in Smith. Catcher Bob Ferguson drove in Start with a single to tie the game 7-7. Ferguson scored the winning run on a throwing error by Cincinnati shortstop George Wright on a hard-hit grounder by George Hall, ending the Red Stockings&#x27; legendary winning streak.

In an 1895 post-retirement interview with sportswriter Tim Murnane, Start revealed a little-known secret: “We wanted to stop playing when the score was five each, but [Cincinnati team leader] Harry Wright wouldn’t have it. You see, the Atlantics were playing on the co-operative plan, and another game meant $300 or $400 for each man.” Murnane confessed: “This was the first time I ever knew why the Brooklyn men left the field after the ninth inning, and I was present at the game.”

==Professional era==

In 1871, Start joined the new—and fully professional—National Association (NA), playing for the New York Mutuals and, at age 28, hitting a career-high .360, second highest on the team. He also hit the team&#x27;s only home run that season. In 1873 he served as the Mutuals&#x27; field leader (a pre-managerial position) for 25 games.

The NA failed after five years. When the National League (NL) was formed in 1876, the Mutuals joined, and Start remained with the team. However, the Mutuals were a poor team in 1876, and after refusing to finish their season schedule because of a financial shortfall, they were expelled from the NL. The following year Start joined the Hartford Dark Blues, and in 1878 moved over to the Chicago White Stockings. 1878 was possibly Start&#x27;s best season with the bat. He led the league with 100 hits and 125 total bases. He came close to the league lead with 12 doubles, 5 triples, and one home run. His 58 runs that year were second in the league. These statistics came in only 285 at bats, and at the age of 35, long after most players have begun to decline.

From 1879 until 1885, when he was 42, Start held down first base for the Providence Grays and continued to hit well; he also served as team captain, a role that provided field leadership before the establishment of team managers. Start&#x27;s 1879 Providence team won the NL flag, and in 1884 they won what is considered the first inter-league championship, beating the New York Metropolitans of the American Association.

After Providence left the NL following the 1885 season, in 1886 Start signed with the Washington Nationals for what proved to be his final season. He only played 31 games for the Nationals, did not hit well, and retired from professional play. After this final sub-par season, his lifetime Major League batting average dipped below .300, to .299. For the final nine seasons of Start&#x27;s career, he was the oldest player on any major league roster. Start played the final game of his professional career on July 9, 1886.

Over his full major league career Start amassed 1,417 hits, 852 runs, and 544 RBI in NL and NA play. He logged a .299 batting average, a .322 on-base percentage, and a .367 slugging percentage. These totals do not include his first twelve pre-league years, during which cumulative player statistics were not recorded. In addition, since Start&#x27;s lifetime totals were achieved in much shorter seasons than today&#x27;s professionals play, they tend to under-represent his sustained quality as a ballplayer.

==Post-baseball life==

After his retirement from the game, Start returned to Rhode Island and operated the Hillside Hotel, near Pawtuxet, and later the Lakewood Inn, in Warwick. His wife, Angeline, died in February, 1927, and Start died one month later, in Providence, Rhode Island, at age 84.

<text>Thomas Simpson, or Sympson the Joiner (fl. 1660s) was a Master-Joiner at the Deptford Dockyard and the Royal Naval Dockyard at Woolwich in London. Samuel Pepys mentions his name several times in his diary.

Pepys&#x27; job as a naval administrator brought him into daily contact with the naval dockyards and he was responsible for various aspects of their administration. Although the diary explicitly notes that Pepys was paying him handsomely, it is probable that Simpson was working for Pepys instead of working on the interiors of warships.

In the 17th century, a &quot;joiner&quot; built furniture out of frame-and-panel construction, a refined version of the techniques that were also used to frame up doors and for the panelling of rooms, while a &quot;cabinet-maker&quot; built furniture with flush surfaces suitable for veneers or marquetry, assembled using dovetails. The two trades were quite distinct, and for the fitting out of Royal Navy ships the services of a joiner would have been much more appropriate.

Pepys&#x27; diary records that he used Simpson&#x27;s services on several occasions to work on improvements for his office and his home in Seething Lane, London. For example, on 14 August 1668 he wrote: &quot;At home I find Simpson putting up my new chimney-piece in our great chamber which is very fine, but will cost a great deal of money, but it is not flung away&quot;.

Of special interest is the fact that Pepys had Simpson build bookcases, or as Pepys called them &#x27;book presses&#x27;, for his growing collection of books. These are now preserved at the Pepys Library at Magdalene College in accordance with the stipulations of Pepys&#x27;s will.

Pepys wrote on 17 August 1667
: So took up my wife and home, there I to the office, and thence with Simpson, the joyner home to put together the press he hath brought me for my books this day, which pleases me exceedingly.
and a few days later
: and then comes Simpson to set up my other new presses for my books, and so he and I fell into the furnishing of my new closett ... so I think it will be as noble a closett as any man hath.

The surviving book presses have paired glazed doors each in 21 small panes, over a low section, also with glazed panes, made to hold large folio volumes. The doors of the lower section slide up and down, and can be removed completely. The base moldings and cornices are finely and robustly carved with acanthus leaf. Such tall book presses with glazed-panel doors were a contemporary innovation.

Pepys began with one book press and eventually reached twelve as his collection of books grew.

<text>Julian Barbour (; born 1937) is a British physicist with research interests in quantum gravity and the history of science.

Since receiving his PhD degree on the foundations of Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity at the University of Cologne in 1968, Barbour has supported himself and his family without an academic position, working part-time as a translator (although he has an Oxford University email address and his research has been funded, for example by a FQXi grant). He resides near Banbury, England.

==Timeless physics==
His 1999 book &quot;The End of Time&quot; advances timeless physics: the controversial view that time, as we perceive it, does not exist as anything other than an illusion, and that a number of problems in physical theory arise from assuming that it does exist. He argues that we have no evidence of the past other than our memory of it, and no evidence of the future other than our belief in it. &quot;Difference merely creates an illusion of time, with each individual moment existing in its own right, complete and whole.&quot; He calls these moments &quot;Nows&quot;. It is all an illusion: there is no motion and no change. He argues that the illusion of time is what we interpret through what he calls &quot;time capsules&quot;, which are &quot;any fixed pattern that creates or encodes the appearance of motion, change or history&quot;.

Barbour&#x27;s theory goes further in scepticism than the block universe theory, since it denies not only the passage of time, but the existence of an external dimension of time. Physics orders &quot;Nows&quot; by their inherent similarity to each other. That ordering is what we conventionally call a time ordering, but does not come about from &quot;Nows&quot; occurring &quot;at&quot; specific times, since they do not occur, nor does it come about from their existing unchangingly along the time axis of a block universe, but it is rather derived from their actual content.

The philosopher J. M. E. McTaggart reached a similar conclusion in his 1908 &quot;The Unreality of Time.&quot;

==Machian dynamics==
Barbour also researches Machian physics, a related field. The Machian approach requires physics
to be constructed from directly observable quantities. In standard analytical dynamics a system&#x27;s future evolution can be determined from a state consisting of particle positions and momenta (or instantaneous velocities). Barbour believes that the Machian approach eschews the momenta/instantaneous velocities, which are not directly observable, and so needs more than one &quot;snapshot&quot; consisting of positions only. This relates to the idea of snapshots, or &quot;Nows&quot; in Barbour&#x27;s thinking on time.

Along with physicist Bruno Bertotti, Barbour developed a technique called &quot;best matching&quot; for deriving gravitational equations directly from astronomical measurements of objects&#x27; spatial relations with each other. Published in 1982, the method describes gravitational effects as accurately as Einstein&#x27;s general relativity, but without the need for a &quot;background&quot; grid of spacetime. According to physicist David Wiltshire at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, such a truly Machian or relational approach could explain the appearance of an accelerated expansion of the universe without invoking a causative agent such as dark energy.

==Criticism of Barbour&#x27;s ideas==
Theoretical physicist Lee Smolin repeatedly refers to Barbour&#x27;s ideas in his books. However Smolin is usually highly critical of Barbour&#x27;s ideas, since Smolin is a proponent of a realist theory of time, where time is real and not a mere illusion as Barbour suggests. Smolin reasons that physicists have improperly rejected the reality of time because they confuse their mathematical models—which are timeless but deal in abstractions that do not exist—with reality. Smolin hypothesizes instead that the very laws of physics are not fixed, but that they actually evolve over time.

Theoretical physicist Sean Carroll has criticised Barbour and all physicists who adhere to a &quot;timeless-view&quot; of the universe:

The problem is not that I disagree with the timelessness crowd, it&#x27;s that I don&#x27;t see the point. I am not motivated to make the effort to carefully read what they are writing, because I am very unclear about what is to be gained by doing so. If anyone could spell out straightforwardly what I might be able to understand by thinking of the world in the language of timelessness, I&#x27;d be very happy to re-orient my attitude and take these works seriously.

== Political activity ==

In the October 1974 United Kingdom general election, Barbour stood as an Independent English Nationalist candidate in Banbury, receiving 547 votes. He later became active in the SDP.

<text>The Samurai-dokoro (侍所 - Board of Retainers) was an office of the Kamakura and Muromachi shogunates. The role of the &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot; was to take the leadership of &quot;gokenin&quot;, the shogun&#x27;s retainers, and to be in charge of the imprisonment of criminals. It was established in 1180 by Minamoto no Yoritomo, the founder of the Kamakura shogunate.

== History ==

=== Kamakura period ===
During the Kamakura period, the &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot; was in charge of calling in and directing the &quot;gokenin&quot;, the shogun&#x27;s retainers. It was also in charge of the imprisonment of criminals.

The office was administered by officials called &quot;shoshi&quot; or &quot;samuraidokoro-no-tsukasa,&quot; who were made up from the most powerful &quot;gokenin&quot;. The most senior of the officials, the president of the &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot;, was called &quot;bettō&quot;. The office was established by Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1180, who appointed Wada Yoshimori its first &quot;bettō&quot;. However, after Yoshimori was killed during the Wada Rebellion, the &quot;shikken&quot; (regent of the shogunate) took over the post of &quot;bettō&quot;.

In the &quot;Engyobon Heike Monogatari&quot;, the &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot; was established upon the request of Wada Yoshimori, and it was modeled after the Taira government period office called &quot;samurai&quot; &quot;bettō&quot; that Fujiwara no Tadakiyo was appointed to rule over the samurai of the eight provinces of Bandō (present-day Kantō region). If this is true, the &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot; was not modeled after the household agency of noble families that shares the same name.

As Yoritomo&#x27;s position rose, the &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot; began to also take on the role of a domestic administration institution. In the Kenkyū era, Wada Yoshimori, the &quot;bettō&quot;, was in charge of military affairs in general as well as domestic administration, and Kajiwara Kagetoki, a &quot;shoshi&quot;, was in charge of directing the &quot;gokenin&quot;, the basis of the Kamakura shogunate.

=== Muromachi period ===
Under the Muromachi shogunate, the &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot; was led by a &quot;tōnin&quot; or &quot;shoshi&quot;, who was assisted by a &quot;shoshi-dai&quot;. &quot;Bugyōnin&quot; was in charge of administrative paperwork, and there were junior officers, &quot;kodoneri&quot;, &quot;zōshiki&quot;, and others. Additionally, &quot;kaikō&quot; took on the duties of a clerk, &quot;metsuke&quot; worked as an inspector, and &quot;yoriudo&quot; took on the duties of an investigator, among other officials.

The &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot; was largely dependent on the military power of the daimyo, and in reality the &quot;shoshi-dai&quot;, a high-ranking retainer of the &quot;shoshi&quot;, was in charge of the &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot;. During events like the Tsuchi-ikki peasant uprising, a powerful military was required to suppress the chaotic situation, and in such cases the &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot; asked help from the daimyo and the &quot;kenmon&quot; (powerful families).

Between the late Muromachi period and the Sengoku period, &quot;shoshi&quot; and &quot;shoshi-dai&quot; were no longer appointed, and the &quot;kaikō&quot; was in turn charge of the &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot;. The shogunate &quot;bugyōnin&quot; was appointed this post and was either from the Matsuda clan or the Īno&#x27;o clan. The &quot;kaikō&quot; was required to stay in Kyoto and be in charge of Kyoto&#x27;s public security and the management of prisons, and also served as an advisor to the shogun and other &quot;kenmon&quot; on judgements. Additionally, after mid-Muromachi period, the &quot;kaikō&quot; formed its own military by recruiting local Kyoto &quot;jizamurai&quot; and skilled vagrants. After the Ōnin War (1467-77), the military power of the &quot;shoshi&quot; weakened, and the &quot;kaikō&quot;&#x27;s hikan and the officials of another &quot;Samurai-dokoro&quot; took over the public security. Additionally, the military power of the &quot;kaikō&quot; directly played a part in the military power of the Ashikaga shoguns, and according to the records at the time, the &quot;kaikō&quot; could mobilize an estimated 200 to 300 men.

<doc id="429387" wikidata="Q839542" url="?curid=429387" title="Indian spot-billed duck">
<text>The Indian spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) is a species of large dabbling duck that is a non-migratory breeding duck throughout freshwater wetlands in the Indian subcontinent. The name is derived from the red spot at the base of the bill that is found in the mainland Indian population. When in water it can be recognized from a long distance by the white tertials that form a stripe on the side, and in flight it is distinguished by the green speculum with a broad white band at the base. This species and the eastern spot-billed duck (&quot;A. zonorhyncha&quot;) were formerly considered conspecific, together called the spot-billed duck (&quot;A. poecilorhyncha&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The Indian spot-billed duck was described by the naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster in 1781 under its current binomial name &quot;Anas poecilorhyncha&quot;. The name of the genus &quot;Anas&quot; is the Latin word for a duck. The specific epithet &quot;poecilorhyncha&quot; combines the classical Greek words &quot;poikilos&quot; meaning &quot;pied&quot; or &quot;spotted&quot; and &quot;rhunkhos&quot; meaning a &quot;bill&quot;.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2009 that compared mitochondrial DNA sequences from ducks, geese and swans in the family Anatidae found that the Indian spot-billed duck was a sister species to a clade containing the Mexican duck, the American black duck, the mottled duck and the mallard. A 2014 study, however, shows that there is discordance between the phylogenies obtained using nuclear DNA sequences; the Indian spot-bill appears to be closer to the Laysan and Hawaiian ducks and forming a sister clade to the New World and Old World mallards and the Mexican, American black and mottled ducks. There is significant hybridization between Old World mallards and eastern spot-billed ducks, leading to a closeness in their mitochondrial DNA that alters the apparent phylogenies.

Two subspecies are recognised although intergradation is possible (intermediates between &quot;haringtoni&quot; and eastern spot-billed duck have been recorded):

* &quot;A. p. haringtoni&quot; (Oates, 1907) – Myanmar to southern China and Laos (named after Herbert Hastings Harington (1868–1916))

The eastern spot-billed duck was formerly considered as a third subspecies. Fieldwork carried out at Hong Kong in southern China and published in 2006 found that although both the eastern spot-billed duck and the Indian spot-billed duck (subspecies &quot;A. p. haringtoni&quot;) bred in the region at the same time, mixed pairs were only very rarely observed. Based on this observation most taxonomists now treat the eastern spot-billed duck as a separate species.

==Description==
This duck is around the same size as a mallard and has a scaly patterned body with a green speculum bordered by white. At rest the white stripe stands out and the long neck and the bill with yellow tip and orange red spots at the base are distinctive in the nominate subspecies. In flight it is distinguished by the green speculum with a broad white band at the base. The red spots at the base of the bills are absent in &quot;haringtoni&quot;. It measures in length and across the wings, with a body mass of . These are mainly grey ducks with a paler head and neck and a black bill tipped bright yellow. The wings are whitish with black flight feathers below, and from above show a white-bordered green The male has a red spot on the base of the bill, which is absent or inconspicuous in the smaller but otherwise similar female. The male does not have an eclipse plumage. The legs and feet are bright orange to coral red. Juveniles are browner and duller than adults.

The eastern spot-billed duck is darker and browner; its body plumage is more similar to the Pacific black duck. It lacks the red bill spot, and has a blue speculum.

Both males and females undergo a complete post-breeding moult, dropping all their wing feathers simultaneously.

==Distribution ==
This duck is a resident throughout Pakistan and India in freshwater wetlands. They tend to avoid very large patches of open water and prefer medium-sized wetlands with vegetation cover. Some individuals may however migrate as a bird ringed at Bharatpur in Rajasthan on 5 December 1969 was recovered near Novosibirsk in August 1970. It is quite gregarious outside the breeding season and forms small flocks. The northernmost populations have expanded their range northwards by more than 500 km since the early 20th century, possibly in reaction to global warming.

==Biology==
It is a bird of freshwater lakes and marshes in fairly open country and feeds by dabbling for plant food mainly in the evening or at night. The breeding season varies with rainfall and water condition but is July to September in northern India and November to December in southern India. Multiple broods may be raised. It nests on the ground hidden in vegetation near water, and lays 8-14 eggs. Nests have sometimes been seen on tree branches covered by creepers. Incubation begins after the last egg is laid (allowing the chicks to hatch simultaneously) and the young hatch after about 24 days. The chicks are black with a yellow back and resemble those of mallards but with a wider eyestripe.

Both the male and female have calls similar to that of the mallard. Mallards and eastern spot-billed ducks have been known to hybridize in the wild in eastern Russia and their genetic closeness has been examined in many studies. Indian spot-billed ducks feed on plants, including crops such as rice, as well as invertebrates including snails. Through snails such as &quot;Lymnaea luteola&quot;, they also get infected by cercarian trematodes such as &quot;Echinoparyphium bagulai.&quot; Adult trematodes emerge from the duck after about 21 days. Other trematodes recorded in the species include &quot;Psilochasmus oxyurus&quot; while helminths include &quot;Opisthorchis obsequens&quot;, &quot;Notocotylus babai&quot;, &quot;N. linearis&quot;, &quot;Echinoparyphium clerci&quot;, &quot;Amidostomum skrjabini&quot;, and &quot;Hymenolepis wardlei&quot;.

They are seen isolated from other species and usually in pairs or small groups and when disturbed they can take off easily and nearly vertically from the water. They were hunted extensively in British India, noted for their excellent taste. When shot at, especially when in moult, they are known to dive and remain underwater to evade capture. A local name for it was &quot;gheret-pai&quot; or &quot;garam-pai&quot;. In southern India, a method of hunting involved using floating bundles of rushes on which the hunters lay in wait. Natural predators of the ducks include birds of prey and terrestrial predators including pythons and otters.

<doc id="429388" wikidata="Q1929961" url="?curid=429388" title="4 (Foreigner album)">
<text>4, also known as Foreigner 4, is the fourth studio album by the British-American rock band Foreigner, released on July 3, 1981, by Atlantic Records. The album&#x27;s name signifies that it is the band&#x27;s fourth studio album and also the fact that the band&#x27;s membership had reduced from six to four members. Musically, it showed Foreigner shifting from hard rock to more accessible mainstream rock and pop music. 

The album was a commercial success worldwide, holding the No. 1 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for a total of 10 weeks. It eventually sold over six million copies in the U.S. alone. Several of its singles were hits, including &quot;Urgent&quot;, &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot; and &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot;.

==Background and writing==
The album was originally titled &quot;Silent Partners&quot; and later was changed to &quot;4&quot;, reflecting both the fact that it was Foreigner&#x27;s fourth album and that the band now consisted of four members. In 1981, art studio Hipgnosis was asked to design a cover based on the original title, and it developed a black-and-white image of a young man in bed with a pair of binoculars suspended in the air overhead. The design was rejected by the band as they felt that it was &quot;too homosexual.&quot; The replacement cover for &quot;4&quot; was designed by Bob Defrin and modeled after an old fashioned film leader. Hipgnosis received credit for the design of the label.

Both Ian McDonald and Al Greenwood had departed the group before the recording of &quot;4&quot;, partly because they wanted to take a more significant role in writing songs while Mick Jones wanted to control the songwriting along with Lou Gramm. As a result, all of the songs on the album are compositions by Jones and/or Gramm. McDonald, who had played saxophone, and Greenwood, who had played keyboards, were replaced by session musicians, including Junior Walker, who played the saxophone solo in the bridge of &quot;Urgent&quot;, and a young Thomas Dolby.

During the course of the 10 months in which the album was recorded, the starting time of the band&#x27;s daily work in the recording studio transitioned from noon to midnight. This changing schedule inspired the opening song on the album, &quot;Night Life.&quot; According to Jones, &quot;The later it got at night, the bigger the buzz got, and a lot of weird characters, some of them hookers, would appear. It was a big mixture of a lot of different characters – so that was the inspiration for opening song, &#x27;Night Life.&#x27;”

==Reception==
The editors of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; called &quot;4&quot; Foreigner&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Matt Wardlaw rated four of the songs from &quot;4—&quot;&quot;Juke Box Hero&quot;, &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot;, &quot;Urgent&quot; and &quot;Night Life&quot;—among Foreigner&#x27;s top 10 songs. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Eduardo Rivadavia rated two of the songs from &quot;4—&quot;&quot;Girl on the Moon&quot; and &quot;Woman in Black&quot;—among Foreigner&#x27;s 10 most-underrated songs. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; critic Malcolm Dome also rated two songs from &quot;4&quot; among Foreigner&#x27;s 10 most underrated—&quot;I’m Gonna Win,&quot; which he compares to &quot;Juke Box Hero,&quot; at #8 and &quot;Night Life,&quot;—which he praises for its &quot;confident energy,&quot; at #1. &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Evan Sawdey called &quot;Night Life&quot; a &quot;remarkably limp album opener.&quot;

Mick Jones has rated three of the songs from &quot;4&quot; (&quot;Urgent,&quot; &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot; and &quot;Girl on the Moon&quot;) among his 11 favorite Foreigner songs.

<text>Aron Lee Ralston (born October 27, 1975) is an American mountaineer, mechanical engineer, and motivational speaker, known for surviving a canyoneering accident by cutting off part of his own right arm.

On April 26, 2003, during a solo descent of Bluejohn Canyon in southeastern Utah, he dislodged a boulder, pinning his right wrist to the side of the canyon wall. After five days, he had to break his forearm, amputate it with a dull pocket knife to break free, make his way through the rest of the canyon, rappel down a drop, and hike to safety.

The incident is documented in Ralston&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Between a Rock and a Hard Place&quot; and is the subject of the 2010 film &quot;127 Hours&quot; in which he is portrayed by James Franco.

After the accident he continued mountaineering and became the first person to ascend all of Colorado&#x27;s fourteeners solo in winter.

==Early life==

Aron Ralston was born on October 27, 1975, in Marion, Ohio. He and his family moved to Denver in the 1980s when he was 12, where he attended Cherry Creek High School and learned to ski and backpack. He received his college degree from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, finishing with degrees in mechanical engineering and French, with a minor in piano. At Carnegie Mellon, he served as a resident assistant, studied abroad, and was an active intramural sports participant. He also worked as a rafting guide during the summer.

Ralston worked as a mechanical engineer with Intel in Chandler, Tacoma and Albuquerque for five years, but found himself burned out by working in a large corporation. During his time as an engineer he had built up skills in mountaineering, and in 2002 he quit in order to climb Denali. He moved to Aspen, Colorado in order to pursue a life of climbing mountains.

Ralston began working towards his goal of climbing all of Colorado&#x27;s &quot;fourteeners&quot;—peaks over altitude, of which there are 59—solo and during winter (a feat that had never been recorded before). In 2003, he was caught in a Grade 5 avalanche on Resolution Peak, Colorado with his skiing partners Mark Beverly and Chadwick Spencer. No one was seriously injured, but his friends did not speak to him in the aftermath, causing him to reevaluate his approach to risk management.

==Canyoneering accident==
In the afternoon hours on April 26, 2003, Aron Ralston was canyoneering alone through Bluejohn Canyon, in eastern Wayne County, Utah, just south of the Horseshoe Canyon unit of Canyonlands National Park. While he was descending the lower stretches of the slot canyon, a suspended boulder dislodged while he was climbing down from it. The boulder first smashed his left hand, and then crushed his right hand against the canyon wall. Ralston had not informed anyone of his hiking plans, nor did he have any way to call for help.

Assuming that he would die without intervention, he spent five days slowly sipping his small amount of remaining water, approximately 350 ml (12 imp fl oz), and slowly eating his small amount of food, two burritos, while repeatedly trying to extricate his arm. His efforts were futile as he was unable to free his arm from the 800 lb (360 kg) chockstone. After three days of trying to lift and break the boulder, the dehydrated and delirious Ralston prepared to amputate his trapped arm at a point on the mid-forearm in order to escape. After having experimented with tourniquets and having made exploratory superficial cuts to his forearm, he realized, on the fourth day, that in order to free his arm he would have to cut through the bones in it, but the tools available were insufficient to do so.

After running out of food and water on the fifth day, Ralston decided to drink his own urine. He carved his name, date of birth and presumed date of death into the sandstone canyon wall, and videotaped his last goodbyes to his family. He did not expect to survive the night, but as he attempted to stay warm he began hallucinating and had a vision of himself playing with a future child while missing part of his right arm. Ralston credited this as giving him the belief that he would live.

After waking at dawn the following day he discovered that his arm had begun to decompose due to the lack of circulation, and became desperate to tear it off. Ralston then had an epiphany that he could break his radius and ulna bones using torque against his trapped arm. He did so, then amputated his forearm with his multi-tool, using the dull knife and pliers for the tougher tendons. The painful process took an hour, during which time he used tubing from a CamelBak as a tourniquet, taking care to leave major arteries until last. The manufacturer of the multi-tool was never named, but Ralston said &quot;it was not a Leatherman but what you&#x27;d get if you bought a $15 flashlight and got a free multi-use tool.&quot;

After freeing himself, Ralston climbed out of the slot canyon in which he had been trapped, rappelled down a sheer wall, then hiked out of the canyon. He was from his vehicle, and had no phone. However, after of hiking, he encountered a family on vacation from the Netherlands; Eric and Monique Meijer and their son Andy, who gave him food and water and hurried to alert the authorities. Ralston had feared he would bleed to death; he had lost , including 25% of his blood volume. Rescuers searching for Ralston, alerted by his family that he was missing, had narrowed the search down to Canyonlands and he was picked up by a helicopter in a wide area of the canyon. He was rescued approximately four hours after amputating his arm.

Ralston later said that if he had amputated his arm earlier, he would have bled to death before being found, while if he had not done it he would have been found dead in the slot canyon days later.

His severed hand and forearm were retrieved from under the boulder by park authorities. According to television presenter Tom Brokaw, it took 13 men, a winch and a hydraulic jack to move the boulder so that Ralston&#x27;s arm could be removed. His arm was then cremated and the ashes given to Ralston. He returned to the accident scene with Tom Brokaw and a camera crew six months later, on his 28th birthday, to film a &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; special about the accident in which he scattered the ashes of his arm there, where he said they belong.

==After the accident==
After the accident occurred, Ralston made numerous appearances in the media. On July 21, 2003, Ralston appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and his story was featured by &quot;GQ&quot; &quot;Men of the Year&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; &quot;People of 2003&quot;.

Ralston documented his experience in an autobiographical book titled &quot;Between a Rock and a Hard Place&quot;, published by Atria Books in September 2004. It reached No. 3 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Hardcover Non-Fiction list. It hit No. 1 in New Zealand and Australia, and is the No. 7 best-selling memoir of all-time in the United Kingdom. Later that month, Ralston&#x27;s story was featured on a two-hour edition of &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; called &quot;Desperate Days in Blue John Canyon&quot;.

Ralston has appeared twice on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. He has also appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, &quot;CNN&#x27;s American Morning with Bill Hemmer&quot;, &quot;Minute to Win It&quot;, &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;, &quot;CNN Saturday Morning&quot;, &quot;Enough Rope&quot;, and &quot;CNBC with Deborah Norville&quot;. On September 28, 2004, he appeared on the radio program &quot;The Bob Rivers Show&quot; and described his ordeal as &quot;six days of terror and horror.&quot;

After his recovery he continued to climb mountains, including Aconcagua in 2005, and in 2008, Ojos del Salado in Chile and Monte Pissis in Argentina. In 2005, Ralston became the first person to climb all of the 59 ranked and/or named of Colorado&#x27;s &#x27;fourteeners&#x27; solo in winter, a project he started in 1997 and resumed after the amputation in Bluejohn Canyon.

In 2006, Ralston was featured as a panelist in Miller Lite&#x27;s &quot;Man Laws&quot; ad campaign.
He later noted that surviving being trapped in the canyon had given him a sense of invincibility, at a time that it should have humbled him. He lost friends to suicide, and became depressed after his girlfriend broke up with him in 2006. He has since tried to shift his focus away from adventure-seeking for esteem purposes.

In 2008, Ralston signed on to advise polar explorer Eric Larsen on his 2009–2010 &quot;Save the Poles&quot; expedition, of traveling to the north and south poles, and climbing Mount Everest (sometimes referred to as the third pole) within the same year.

In August 2009, Ralston married Jessica Trusty. Their first child was born in February 2010. They divorced in early 2012.

In 2011, Ralston was a contestant on the U.S. television show &quot;Minute To Win It&quot;, where he won $125,000 for Wilderness Workshop, made a cameo on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXII&quot;, took part in the reality show &quot;Alone in the Wild&quot;, where he had to &#x27;survive&#x27; in the wild with a video camera and a bag of supplies, and delivered the commencement speech at Carnegie Mellon University for the graduating class of 2011.

He has also appeared on the Comedy Central show &quot;Tosh.0&quot; in a sketch with host Daniel Tosh and another climber in 2012.

===Assault charge===
In December 2013, Ralston and his girlfriend, Vita Shannon, who have a daughter together, were both arrested after an altercation at their home. The circumstances of the altercation are unclear. Charges against Ralston were dropped shortly after, and charges against Shannon were dropped after Ralston did not show up to a court hearing. According to the affidavit, Ralston &quot;was struck twice in the back of the head with fists by (Shannon), after an argument they had regarding the victim&#x27;s other son.&quot; Shannon alleged in return, that Ralston &quot;shoved her on the shoulder&quot;.

===Public speaking===
As a corporate speaker, Ralston receives an honorarium of about $25,000 per domestic speaking appearance, and up to $37,000 for international speeches. On May 4, 2007, Ralston appeared at the Swiss Economic Forum and gave a speech about how he &quot;lost his hand, but gained his life back.&quot;

==&quot;127 Hours&quot;==

British film director Danny Boyle directed the film &quot;127 Hours&quot; about Ralston&#x27;s accident. Filming took place in March and April 2010, with a release in New York City and Los Angeles on November 5, 2010. Fox Searchlight Pictures funded the film. Actor James Franco played the role of Ralston. The movie received standing ovations at both the Telluride Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival. Some of the audience members in Toronto fainted during the final amputation scene.

The film received widespread acclaim by critics; review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 93% of 239 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 8.2/10.

At the 83rd Academy Awards in 2011 the film was nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture (won by &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;) and Best Actor for Franco (won by Colin Firth for his role in &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;). &quot;127 Hours&quot; was also nominated in the categories for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, and Best Editing.

Of the authenticity of &quot;127 Hours,&quot; Ralston has said that the film is &quot;so factually accurate it is as close to a documentary as you can get and still be a drama,&quot; and he jokingly added that he thought it is &quot;the best film ever made.&quot;

<doc id="429400" wikidata="Q652464" url="?curid=429400" title="Kolomenskoye">
<text>Kolomenskoye () is a former royal estate situated several kilometers to the southeast of the city center of Moscow, Russia, on the ancient road leading to the town of Kolomna (hence the name). The 390 hectare scenic area overlooks the steep banks of the Moskva River. It became a part of Moscow in the 1960s.

==The White Column of Kolomenskoye==
Kolomenskoye village was first mentioned in the testament of Ivan Kalita (1339). As time went by, the village was developed as a favourite country estate of grand princes of Muscovy. The earliest existing structure is the exceptional Ascension church (1532), built in white stone to commemorate the long-awaited birth of an heir to the throne, the future Ivan the Terrible. Being the first stone church of tent-like variety, the uncanonical &quot;White Column&quot; (as it is sometimes referred to) marked a stunning break from the Byzantine tradition.

The church reaches toward the sky from a low cross-shaped &quot;podklet&quot; (ground floor), followed by a prolonged &quot;chetverik&quot; (octagonal body, and then an octagonal &quot;tent&quot;, crowned by a tiny dome. The narrow pilasters on the sides of the &quot;chetverik&quot;, the arrow-shaped window frames, the three tiers of the &quot;kokoshniks&quot; and the quiet rhythm of stair arcades and open galleries underline the dynamic tendency of this masterpiece of the Russian architecture. The whole vertical composition is believed to have been borrowed from hipped roof-style wooden churches of the Russian North. Recognizing its outstanding value for humanity, UNESCO decided to inscribe the church on the World Heritage List in 1994.

==The great palace and other structures==
Tsar Alexis I had all the previous wooden structures in Kolomenskoye demolished and replaced them with a new great wooden palace, famed for its fanciful, fairytale roofs. Foreigners referred to this huge maze of intricate corridors and 250 rooms, as &#x27;an Eighth Wonder of the World&#x27;. Although basically only a summer palace, it was the favorite residence of Tsar Alexis I. The future Empress Elizabeth Petrovna was born in the palace in 1709, and Tsar Peter the Great spent part of his youth here. Upon the departure of the court for St. Petersburg, the palace fell into disrepair, so that Catherine II refused to make it her Moscow residence. On her orders the wooden palace was demolished in 1768, and replaced with a much more modest stone-and-brick structure. 

Detailed plans of the Alexis I palace survived. The Moscow Government completed a full-scale reconstruction in 2010. The rebuilt palace stands approximately to the south of its original location near the White Column, in order to preserve the historic foundations. The palace erected by Catherine the Great in 1768 was demolished in 1872, and only a few gates and outside buildings remain.

During the early Soviet period, under the initiative of architect and restorer Pyotr Baranovsky, old wooden buildings and various artifacts were transported to Kolomenskoye from different parts of the USSR for preservation, so currently Kolomenskoye Park hosts an impressive set of different constructions and historical objects.

<doc id="429403" wikidata="Q1851660" url="?curid=429403" title="Storytelling System">
<text>The Storytelling System is a role-playing game system created by White Wolf, Inc. for the Chronicles of Darkness (formerly known as the New World of Darkness), a game world with several tabletop role-playing games tied in. The Storytelling System is largely based on the Storyteller System, the rule set used for White Wolf&#x27;s older game setting, the World of Darkness (for a time known as &quot;old&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; World of Darkness).

== History ==

While on the road to Gen Con &#x27;90, Mark Rein-Hagen came upon the idea of a new game design that would become &quot;&quot;. Tom Dowd, co-designer for &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, worked with Rein-Hagen to adapt the core mechanics from his previous game success to use d10 instead of d6 for calculating probability.

Over the next few years, several games were published under this rule set. The World of Darkness games exclusively used this ruleset, as did &quot;Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game&quot; (1995), &quot;Trinity&quot; (1997), and &quot;Exalted&quot; (2001).

The &quot;Storyteller System&quot; was discontinued in 2003 after completing the metaplot building up since &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;. It was replaced by the &quot;Storytelling System&quot;, a more streamlined rule set. The &quot;Storytelling System&quot; premiered in &quot;The World of Darkness&quot; in 2004.

== Character creation ==

&quot;Storytelling System&quot; characters are built with character points that represent a Dot on their character sheets. Each Dot represents a ten-sided die (d10). The more Dots in an Attribute or Skill, the better the character is at those abilities. A set of dice representing the Dots in an Attribute or Skill forms a Dice Pool that the character uses to see if they succeed or fail at specific tasks.

Characters have nine Attributes in three groups: Mental, Physical, and Social. In the &quot;Storytelling System&quot;, Attributes are also divided into three use-based categories: Power (the ability to alter one&#x27;s environment), Finesse (the ability to use power efficiently), and Resilience (the ability to cope with power being exercised upon one&#x27;s self).

All Attributes are rated on a scale from one to five dots. Two dots represents an average capacity in that attribute, while five displays the peak of human ability. Attributes generally cannot have a rank of zero within the Storytelling System.

Characters have a wide array of Skills to choose from that represent specialized areas of knowledge. Like Attributes, each Ability / Skill has up to five dots to represent a character&#x27;s abilities. Unlike attributes, however, abilities can have no dots filled in to represent a complete lack of training and experience.

Advantages in the game are such things as the character&#x27;s Defense score, Health, Initiative, Morality, Size, Speed, and Willpower. Most of these either exist as pre-assigned values as part of character creation, or are derived from one or more of the character&#x27;s Attributes or Skills.

In the &quot;Storytelling System&quot;, each character has one Virtue and one Vice. A Virtue is some defining quality of a character&#x27;s personality and an ideal which they struggle to aspire. A Vice is a basic weakness in the character&#x27;s personality, and a flaw or guilty pleasure they may indulge even while knowing that there may be consequences to suffer. Characters can regain willpower by fulfilling their Virtue or Vice.

In the &quot;Storytelling System&quot;, playable supernatural characters are created by applying a template to the character during character creation, before Merits or Experience. For instance, with a Vampire character, a template describing certain vampiric attributes (Disciplines, Blood points, etc.) is added. To keep the game balanced, only one supernatural template can be applied per character.

Merits are special beneficial abilities and strengths a character may possess. They are similar in a way to Feats in d20 System games, allowing characters to do something the main rules usually don&#x27;t allow. They are organized in the Mental, Physical, and Social categories like Attributes and Skills. In the &quot;Storytelling System&quot;, starting characters get 7 Dots to purchase Merits. Some Merits apply to certain Attributes and provide a bonus when using them. Some also require a certain number of Dots in some other Attribute in order to purchase them. Each Trait has a certain number of Dots associated which indicate its Dot cost. A Trait with 4 Dots, for example, &quot;Common Sense&quot;, costs 4 Dots to purchase. Others have a range of Dots; &quot;Language&quot; for instance, is one Dot, and a character can buy a certain level of it as they choose.

== Game mechanics ==

All game mechanics of the &quot;Storytelling System&quot; utilize a number of 10-sided dice (d10s). The Game Master is called the Storyteller.

Depending on what the situation calls for, a character has a number of Dots in Attributes and Skills associated with the task. Each Dot represents a d10 die that is added to a dice pool to roll for task resolution. For example, if a character is scaling a wall, they add the number of Dots in their Strength Attribute and their Athletics Skill together. In this case, if the character has a Strength of 3 Dots, and an Athletics Skill of 4 Dots, they get 7 dice in a Dice Pool that combines the two (such as weight-lifting or other feats of strength).

Both systems roll their dice pool with the goal of beating a target number. In Chronicles of Darkness games the target number is always 8. Each of the dice that comes up at or above the target number counts as a &quot;Success,&quot; with higher numbers of successes reflect a greater degree of accomplishment.

Modifiers are either bonuses or penalties to a die roll that are determined and added in by the Storyteller, subtracting or adding to the number of dice that can be rolled in a Dice Pool to a maximum of 5.

Anytime a character has absolutely no dice remaining in their pool as a result of negative Modifiers, the task would seem impossible to perform. The character is still allowed a single d10 die roll, called a Chance Roll, to see if sheer blind luck or divine intervention allows them to succeed. Only a result of 10 is a Success on a Chance Roll, but it can be rerolled for more Successes as above), on the other hand a result of 1 is a Dramatic Failure.

Time in &quot;Storytelling System&quot; is measured in small Turns of three seconds. Turns further make up a Scene, which further make up a Chapter. A Chapter is usually one gaming session and Chapters are linked together into an overall Story set in a Chronicle (or the Big Picture), the theme and setting of the entire game.

There are three basic kinds of Actions in the &quot;Storytelling System&quot;. Instant Actions take up very little time like taking a gun off safety, or shouting a small message to an ally. Extended Actions take longer time to accomplish and can extend over a number of Turns to complete, like getting a stuck window open, or changing a light bulb. Contested Actions are Actions that involve dealing with what the opposition does, like shooting at a running target during a Combat Scene.

For every Success a character has on their Attack roll against an opponent, they inflict one Health Point of Damage upon the target. There are three kinds of Damage in White Wolf games: Bashing, Lethal and Aggravated. Bashing Damage is inflicted by blunt objects that bludgeons targets like a baseball bat. Lethal Damage is caused by slashing and piercing weapons like knives and guns. Aggravated Damage is inflicted mainly by supernatural sources and the weaknesses of supernatural creatures (such as fire and sunlight against vampires or silver against werewolves); however, it can also be inflicted by severe radiation poisoning. Characters recover from Bashing Damage quickly, while Aggravated Damage takes the longest to recover from.

Health boxes are checked off by Damage. When the last box is checked with bashing damage, a character is generally at risk of passing out, if the last box is checked with lethal damage, a character is helpless and generally at risk of dying without medical attention, and if the last box is checked with aggravated damage, a character is dead. If a character&#x27;s Health track is filled with Bashing Damage, any additional Bashing Damage is upgraded to Lethal, and if a character&#x27;s Health track is filled with Lethal Damage, any additional Bashing or Lethal damage is upgraded to Aggravated.

After a game, a Storyteller can award experience points to players to improve their character&#x27;s Attributes, Talents and Skills. Experience distribution is typically based upon roleplaying performance (especially if flaws are present), as well as accomplishing short- and long-term goals.

== Variant systems ==

=== Storyteller System ===

The Storyteller system used Abilities instead of Skills. The Mental attributes included Perception instead of Resolve, while the social Attributes of Charisma and Appearance were replaced on the sheet by Presence and Composure, respectively. Unlike all other attributes in the Storyteller system–and unlike all attributes in the Storytelling System–Appearance could have zero dots in it, although this was only to reflect particularly hideous or monstrous characters.

Further, the Target Number for rolls (which was a number a player needs to roll at or above on his dice in order to generate a Success) is variable for most games, although defaulting to 6 for most rolls: a 50% success chance for an individual die.

Unlike the Storytelling system&#x27;s exclusive reliance on Experience points, &quot;Bonus Points&quot; were given out to characters as part of character creation, with more powerful or experienced characters getting additional Bonus Points at character creation. These points were spent like experience points, but were frequently a flat cost per level of a trait increased, as opposed to the increasing cost of experience points to reflect the difficulty of higher levels of mastery.

The Storyteller System frequently treated Merits as optional and frequently did not include them in the core books of most games; if the Storyteller allowed them, they could be purchased with Bonus Points. Merits had costs ranging from 1 to 7 points. Players could also receive Bonus Points for taking Flaws for their character. Certain traits that would later be codified as Merits still existed, but were instead referred to as Backgrounds; advantages such as Contacts, Resources and Status were universal across gamelines.

Whereas most Storytelling games use Virtues and Vices, these do not exist in most games, and are very different where they do exist: Vampire: The Masquerade uses them for varying forms of self-control, and Hunter: The Reckoning ties them directly to Hunters&#x27; supernatural powers. In the mechanical place of Virtue and Vice, most games had instead &quot;Nature,&quot; reflecting a character&#x27;s innermost personality, and &quot;Demeanor,&quot; showing the persona the character displayed to the world at large.

&quot;World of Darkness&quot; games suggest players to have at least ten d10s available to roll for their character&#x27;s task resolutions and Attribute tests; other games, such as &quot;Exalted,&quot; may use more. 

=== Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre ===

The &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre&quot; system, is designed for LARP rather than tabletop roleplaying, and drastically overhauls the core mechanics to adjust for the different playstyle demands, resolving conflicts either through drawing from a deck of cards or by rounds of rock paper scissors.

=== God-Machine Rules ===

In July 2013, White Wolf released a rules update and the first in a series of intended &quot;Chronicle Books&quot; that would give a default focus for games and update their rules to work with the new rules released in &quot;The God-Machine Chronicle&quot;. The system changes include the addition of Conditions and Tilts, which are usually-temporary traits that can impact characters&#x27; abilities; while Conditions apply at all times, Tilts usually directly affect combat.

The Experience Point system also changed greatly: throughout a session, players now accumulate &quot;beats&quot; through coping with or resolving Conditions, dealing with hardships, or accomplishing goals. When the player accumulates five beats, she may redeem these for an Experience. Improving character traits is now flat, such that buying the first dot of a trait costs the same as purchasing the final dot of the same.

On August 16, 2014, Onyx Path Publishing revealed that they were publishing a second edition of the Chronicles of Darkness setting, using the God-Machine rules. They also announced that they would be releasing new editions of their first five games in the setting. While Vampire: The Requiem had released its &quot;The Strix Chronicle&quot; less than a year previous, Onyx Path conceded that the second edition of &quot;Requiem&quot; would be identical enough to &quot;Strix&quot; that they would supply a free PDF of the second edition to anyone who had already purchased a PDF copy of that book.

=== Storypath System ===

New games from Onyx Path, such as &quot;They Came from Beneath the Sea&quot;–as well as new editions of some older games, such as &quot;Scion&quot; and the &quot;Trinity&quot; line–use a new variant of the same mechanics, the &quot;Storypath&quot; system.

As part of the new editions of the Aeon Trinity games and the Scion gameline, a modified game engine was developed with the intent of being able to handle a wide range of character power levels. While the core mechanics remain the same as the Storytelling system, the Storypath system focuses significantly more on ludonarrative consistency: a major resource is Momentum, which does not represent any tangible or recognizable asset but instead the characters&#x27; narrative inclination to succeed in the story as a whole. It is spent by players to enhance or enable their character&#x27;s abilities, and gained by encountering difficulties—failing at rolls, for instance, grants momentum—so that a character facing significant hardship eventually finds themselves with a surfeit of momentum to help them succeed in the end.

Another addition is Scale: a mechanic employed when one character has a significant advantage over another that may not be ideally rendered by a dice pool. A relatively weak giant in &quot;Scion,&quot; for instance, bears an increased scale in rolls relating to strength and damage, granting them bonus successes on successful rolls, but their lower dice pool would still have a small chance of success in the first place. The effects of scale differ against Narrative targets (scenery and nameless bystanders) and Dramatic targets (recognizable characters and objects with significance to the story). While successes are added to Dramatic targets, they are multiplied against narrative ones, allowing for impressive effects that do not automatically overwhelm central characters.

In August 2022, Onyx Path announced they would be releasing a streamlined, more unified version of Storypath, referred to as &quot;Storypath Ultra,&quot; which would present some updated terminology (e.g. referring to &quot;successes&quot; on individual dice as &quot;hits&quot; to prevent confusion between a successful action and an individual &quot;success&quot; on a dice) and more thoroughly integrate some of its mechanics.

<text>Nadira, Lady Naipaul (born Nadira Khannum Alvi; 1953), is a Kenyan-born British Pakistani journalist and the widow of novelist Sir V. S. Naipaul.

==Biography==
She was born in Mombasa, Kenya. At the age of 16 she married an engineer, Agha Hashim, who was 26 years her senior. They had two daughters, Gul Zehra (aka Naeema Hashim) and Sumar Zahra, who lived with various relatives after the marriage ended. Nadira&#x27;s second marriage was to Iqbal Shah, by whom she had a daughter Maleeha, whom V. S. Naipaul later adopted, and a son, Nadir Shah.

She worked as a journalist for &quot;The Nation&quot;, a Pakistani newspaper, for ten years before meeting V. S. Naipaul and moving to England after their marriage. He became her third husband when they married in 1996, two months after the death of Naipaul&#x27;s first wife, Patricia (formerly Patricia Hale).

Lady Naipaul&#x27;s brother, Ameer Faisal Alavi, a two-star general in the Pakistan Army, was assassinated in 2008.
