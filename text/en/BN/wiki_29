<text>Watts is a neighborhood in southern Los Angeles, California. It is located within the South Los Angeles region, bordering the cities of Lynwood, Huntington Park and South Gate to the east and southeast, respectively, and the unincorporated community of Willowbrook to the south.

Founded in the late nineteenth century as a ranching community, the arrival of the railroads and the construction of Watts Station saw the rapid development of Watts as an independent city, but in 1926 it was consolidated with Los Angeles. By the 1940s, Watts transformed into a primarily working class African-American neighborhood, but from the 1960s developed a reputation as a low-income, high-crime area, following the Watts riots and the increasing influence of street gangs. Watts has become a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood with a significant African American minority, and remains one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Los Angeles despite falling crime rates since the 1990s. Notable civic activities by residents of Watts include the &quot;Toys for Watts&quot; toy drive, the Watts Christmas parade, and the &quot;Watts Summer Games&quot; athletic tournament, as well as a local theatre and a dance company, in an effort to improve the neighborhood.

Watts is noted internationally for the landmark Watts Towers by Simon Rodia, which are a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The neighborhood has also been featured or referenced in numerous forms of media, particularly West Coast hip-hop music, and movies and television shows set in Los Angeles.

==History==
===Founding===

The area now known as Watts is situated on the 1843 Rancho La Tajauta Mexican land grant. As on all ranchos, the principal vocation at that time was grazing and beef production.
There were household settlers in the area as early as 1882, and in 1904, the population was counted as 65 people; a year later it was 1,651. C.V. Bartow of Long Beach was noted as one of the founders of Watts.

===Naming===

In 1904, it was reported that Watts was named after Pasadena businessman Charles H. Watts, who was found dead by suicide in the St. Elmo Hotel, Los Angeles, on August 23 of that year. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said: &quot;Watts at one time conducted a livery stable on North Main Street and another at Pasadena and was a man of considerable means. ... Watts station on the Salt Lake road is named after the deceased, and is located on property which he once owned.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Evening Express&quot; said: &quot;Among other property he owned a ranch south of the city through which the Salt Lake railroad passes, and the station of Watts is named for him.&quot;

In 1919, Watts Mayor Z. A. Towne said that the settlement was named after a widow who lived on ten acres which was later occupied by a Pacific Electric power house. She later moved to Arlington, California, Towne said.

In 1912 and 1913, a movement was afoot to change the name of Watts because, as one headline writer put it, the residents were tired of the &quot;quips and jests&quot; at the town&#x27;s expense. One real-estate agent said that prospective clients backed out of a property inspection tour when they found out their streetcar ride would end up in Watts. The name &quot;South Angeles&quot; was proposed. Another plan for a city name change surfaced in 1919, when the city trustees asked for suggestions. Mayor Towne said: &quot;Watts has got a bad reputation in Southern California, somehow or other ... a good many of us felt that the liquor element left a black mark upon the community&#x27;s name. ... Towns are something like people. They can live up to a good name easier than they can live down a bad name.&quot;

===Subdivision===

A subdivision with the name &quot;Watts&quot; was platted, possibly by the Golden State Realty Company, between 1903 and 1905, when the settlement had a population of about 150 people. In 1905 lots were being sold by that firm for prices ranging from $100 to $200: The terms were advertised at a dollar as down payment and a dollar a month thereafter, with the company claiming there would be &quot;no interest and no taxes.&quot; The Watts Lumber Company had a plan of &quot;easy payments&quot; which &quot;enabled those desiring houses in the little settlement to secure their material and to build and occupy their houses at once.&quot;

After 1903, Watts saw the establishment of a newspaper, a general merchandise store, a lumber yard, a grocery store, a millinery, dry goods and confectionery stores, a blacksmithery and bakeries. The Pacific Coast Laundry Company opened in August 1907, with a payroll promised to be between $750 and $1,000 a month. Laundry deliveries were to be made via the electric railway.

===Cityhood===
Watts became a city in 1907, after three petitions objecting to the proposed borders were presented to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Seven ranchers said that they had no intention of subdividing and that all unimproved land should be omitted from the proposed city. Another petition declared that most of the property owners in Watts did not pay taxes inasmuch as they were buying the 25-foot lots for speculation, that the residents were &quot;migratory&quot; and that most of them were transitory &quot;Mexican railroad laborers.&quot; A third petition for exemption was submitted by residents of the Palomar stop, who dressed up their plea with quotations ranging from Greek philosophers to &quot;Hamlet.&quot; Those petitioners announced that they had recently changed the name of their settlement from &quot;Watts Park&quot; because they did not want any affiliation with Watts.

The City of Watts was approved by voters of the district, and it became a municipality in May 1907, with J. F. Donahue, who was a driver for the Blue Ribbon beer company, as mayor and Frederick J. Rorke as city clerk. There was, however, no money to run the city because it had become incorporated too late to levy and collect any taxes. A proposed business license fee raised so much objection that the Board of Trustees, or the city council, submitted to the people a straw vote (nonbinding) question about allowing liquor to be sold in the city. A majority of the 250 votes did agree that Watts should allow saloons, or bars, and that the municipality should raise money by taxing them. Rorke said:

We have two retail saloons and one wholesale as a result, and an income that more than pays our running expenses. In fact, we have several hundred in the treasury. The voters, who admitted the saloons, looked upon it as a business proposition. While many of them are not really in favor of having them in our midst, the experience was adopted for giving us a working fund. Some of the surplus funds are being used to employ engineers to establish street grades, looking forward to improvements in our thoroughfares in the near future. As an instance of prosperity, there is not a vacant house in Watts, and it is impossible to find one to rent.

Watts was brought to nationwide attention in 1908 with the New York production of a musical comedy called &quot;Lonesome Town,&quot; which was set in an imaginary place called Watts, California, in the year 1902. The endeavor, with music by J.A. Rayne and book by Judson D. Brusie, ran for 88 performances at the Circle Theatre, 1825 Broadway, from January 20 through April 24, 1908. It was produced by the vaudeville team of Kolb and Dill – Clarence Kolb and Max Dill.

In response to the raillery occasioned by the play, a &quot;big advertising excursion&quot; took place on Thursday, May 30, 1912, via a special train of three chartered electric railway cars. The route was scheduled over the Balloon Route by way of Los Angeles, Hollywood, the Soldiers&#x27; Home, Ocean Park, Venice, Redondo, Gardena and back to Watts. The object of the excursion was to call attention &quot;to the fact that Watts has been &#x27;born again,&#x27; and the name &#x27;Lucky Watts&#x27; will be used as much as possible, the idea being to get new ideas into people&#x27;s heads, so they will get away from the notion that there is any joke about what the people here believe is the most promising suburban community in the county.&quot; Some 25,000 pieces of advertising material were distributed. The excursion was repeated in 1913.

By 1910, Watts had a population of about 2,500, &quot;well improved streets, a fire department, a weekly newspaper&quot; (the &quot;Watts Advertiser&quot;), and it was completing a $12,000 city hall. It had &quot;the best of public schools, churches of the leading denominations, the principal fraternal orders, a chamber of commerce and a good government league.&quot; That year, business enterprises included the California Gold Recovery Company, which manufactured a machine used in mining districts to capture &quot;flour gold,&quot; which is fine gold floating on a liquid surface. In 1925, Watts had a pump-manufacturing plant, a machine shop, two sash-and-door plants, and a pickle works. There was a steel plant, McClintic Marshal Company, which covered fifteen acres and employed 180 men. A new California Thorn Cordage factory was set to hire five hundred men. A new 34-room hotel was going up on West Main Street.

===Joining Los Angeles===

In a special election on April 2, 1926, Watts residents decided to enter Los Angeles by a vote of 1,338 to 535. It was the heaviest vote ever in Watts, with 1,933 voters at the polls of the 2,513 registered. Thus 23,000 more people were added to Los Angeles when the decision was put into effect on June 1 of that year. Mayor L.A. Edwards of Watts led the fight for consolidation with Los Angeles. Opposed were the Watts Chamber of Commerce, the Farmers and Merchants Bank, the Taxpayers League, the Ku Klux Klan and the Watts Welfare League. Edwards was re-elected to the outgoing Watts Board of Trustees, the other winners being William Booth, Robert Rhoads and James West.

Watts did not become predominantly black until the 1940s. Before then, there were some African American residents, many of whom were Pullman car porters and cooks. Schoolroom photos from 1909 and 1911 show only two or three black faces among the 30 or so children pictured. By 1914, a black realtor, Charles C. Leake, was doing business in the area. Racially restrictive covenants prevented blacks from living in any other neighborhoods outside of Central Avenue District and Watts.

World War II brought the Second Great Migration, tens of thousands of African American migrants, mostly from Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Texas, who left segregated Southern states in search of better opportunities in California. During World War II, the city built several large housing projects (including Jordan Downs and Imperial Courts) for the thousands of new workers in war industries. By the early 1960s, these projects had become nearly 100 percent black, as whites moved on to new suburbs outside the central city. As industrial jobs disappeared from the area, the projects housed many more poor families than they had traditionally. Passenger rail service on the Long Beach Line was shut down in 1961, severing the area&#x27;s primary transportation link to jobs and services in the greater region.
Longstanding resentment by Los Angeles&#x27;s working class black community over discriminatory treatment by police and inadequate public services (especially schools and hospitals) exploded on August 11, 1965, into what were commonly known as the Watts riots. The event that precipitated the disturbances, the arrest of a black youth by the California Highway Patrol on drunk-driving charges, actually occurred outside Watts.

The damage from the riots was particularly severe along the stretch of 103rd Street between Compton and Wilmington Avenues. 103rd Street was the neighborhood&#x27;s historic commercial center, consisting of a traditional main street lined with storefronts, easily accessible by foot from Watts Station. After suffering extensive arson in the riots, the ruined, burnt-out area was nicknamed &quot;Charcoal Alley&quot;. 

An urban renewal plan was drawn up by the redevelopment agency in 1966, with the aim of demolishing all structures between Century Boulevard and 104th Street and redeveloping the area into a modern shopping district. By 1972, the entire area had been acquired and demolished. Century Boulevard, 103rd Street, Compton Avenue, and Wilmington Avenue were all widened into large arterial roads, and the surrounding plots were gradually redeveloped with suburban-style garden apartments and single family subdivisions of much lower density than the previous and surrounding development. The modern shopping center, a main promise of the redevelopment program, was not completed until the early 1980&#x27;s. 

This project dramatically altered the urban fabric of Watts, replacing the densely-populated, walkable main street with large surface parking lots and wide roads carrying hazardous high speed traffic. Community activism in response these problems would eventually lead to a &quot;green streets&quot; project to improve pedestrian safety and environmental quality in the area, beginning in 2016.

Watts suffered further in the 1970s, as gangs gained strength and raised the level of violence in the neighborhood. Between 1989 and 2005, police reported more than 500 homicides in Watts, most of them gang-related and tied to wars over control of the lucrative illicit market created by illegal drugs. Four of Watts&#x27;s influential gangsWatts Cirkle City Piru, Grape Street Watts Crips, Bounty Hunter Watts Bloods, and PJ Watts Cripsformed a Peace Treaty agreement, known as the Watts truce on April 26, 1992. Key hallmarks of the pact continue to influence life in Watts to date, with colors and territory having little to do with gang-related crime.
Beginning in the 1980s, those African Americans who could leave Watts moved to other suburban locations in the Antelope Valley, the Inland Empire, the San Gabriel Valley, Orange County and the San Joaquin Valley. African Americans in Watts have also moved to Southern cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Birmingham, Memphis, San Antonio and Jackson. The black population in Watts has been increasingly replaced by other demographic groups, primarily Hispanic immigrants of Mexican and Central American ancestry, as well as by a median proportion of Ethiopian and Indian ancestry. This demographic change accelerated after the 1992 riots.

Neighborhood leaders have begun a strategy to overcome Watts&#x27;s reputation as a violence-prone and impoverished area. Special promotion has been given to the museums and art galleries in the area surrounding Watts Towers. This sculptural and architectural landmark has attracted many artists and professionals to the area. &quot;I Build the Tower&quot;, a feature-length documentary film about the Watts Towers and their creator, Simon Rodia, provides a history of Watts from the 1920s to the present and a record of the activities of the Watts Towers Arts Center. Watts is one of several Los Angeles neighborhoods with a high concentration of convicted felons. In 2000, singer and actor Tyrese Gibson chartered a foundation to build a community center in Watts.

In 2019, the Watts Towers were a gathering place along the funeral procession from the memorial for Nipsey Hussle at the Staples Center that wound through the streets of South L.A. At times, the crowd flooded the street creating gridlock.

==Geography==
The Mapping L.A. project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; states as follows:

The neighborhood&#x27;s irregular street boundaries follow the Los Angeles city limits on the north and east, except for a small patch of Los Angeles County territory surrounding Ritter Elementary School, between 108th Street and Imperial Highway, which the &quot;Times&quot; includes in Watts.

The southern boundary runs east–west on Imperial Highway, the eastern line is north–south on Alameda Street and the western line is north–south on Central Avenue to 103rd Street. Ted Watkins Park and other county areas are excluded. Thence the line is Success Avenue between Century Boulevard and 92nd Street.

Watts is flanked on the north by Florence-Firestone, on the east by South Gate, on the southeast by Lynwood, on the south by Willowbrook and on the north and west by Green Meadows.

==Demographics==
A total of 36,815 people lived in Watts&#x27;s 2.12 square miles, according to the 2000 U.S. censusaveraging 17,346 people per square mile, among the highest population densities in Los Angeles. Population was estimated at 41,028 in 2008. The median age was 21, making Watts the Los Angeles neighborhood with the youngest population. The percentages of residents aged birth to 18 were among the county&#x27;s highest.

Hispanics made up 61.6% of the population, blacks 37.1%, non-Hispanic whites 0.5%, Asian 0.2%, and others 0.5%. Mexico and El Salvador were the most common places of birth for the 34% of the residents who were born abroad, an average percentage of foreign-born when compared with the city or county as a whole.

The $25,161 median household income in 2008 dollars was considered low for the city and county. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less was high, compared to the county at large. The average household size of 4 people was high for the city. Renters occupied 67% of the housing units, and homeowners occupied the rest.

In 2000, there were 2,816 families headed by single parents, or 38.9%, the highest rate for any neighborhood in the city. The percentages of never-married women (45.3) and never-married men (44.7) were among the county&#x27;s highest.

In 2000, there were 739 military veterans, or 3.6% of the population, low when compared to the rest of the city.

==Education==

There was a school in Watts from an early date. In 1905 it was reported that &quot;steps have already been taken to enlarge the present school building&quot;, and a new building was erected in 1911 at a cost of $30,000. By 1914, however, that structure had become overcrowded, and additional desks were &quot;installed everywhere, in the library, in the halls and in the auditorium.&quot; There were 630 pupils and 18 teachers. While work was under way on a new school, the contractor absconded with some of the money and his bondsman was compelled to finish the job. Older students attended Redondo Union High School. Later, Watts was a part of the Compton School District, but in January 1914, a mass meeting was held in Watts to make plans to secede from Compton and build a new high school in Watts, at a cost of about $100,000. Later the same month, Watts boosters made the same statement at a meeting with Compton backers in that city. By 1925 Watts voters had approved $170,000 in bonds for a new high school, and the town was served by four public grammar schools and one Catholic school. There were seven grade schools.

Just 2.9% of Watts residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree, according to the 2000 census, which is considered a low figure for both the city and the county. The percentage of those residents with less than a high school diploma was high in comparison with the county at large.

In May 2013, Wiegand Avenue Elementary School became the first school in California from which a principal was ordered to be removed in response to the state&#x27;s 2010 &quot;trigger law,&quot; which compels the dismissal of a school administrator on petition of a majority of parents. As a result of the pending loss of principal Irma Cobian, 21 of 22 teachers asked for transfer to other schools.

===Public libraries===
A Watts public library was established in 1913, with Maud Walton as the first librarian and Bessie Hunt as the second. In the same year the city received word that its application for construction of a new Carnegie Library had been approved. The cornerstone of the library was laid in January 1914. In 1914 the library moved into a newly built Carnegie library. Los Angeles annexed Watts in 1926, so the library became the Watts Branch of the Los Angeles library system. In 1957 voters approved a library branch bond, and a Watts Branch opened in 1960. In 1991 the Los Angeles City Council approved a measure, backed by the Friends of the Watts Branch Library, the 15th District Council Office, and the Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) of the City of Los Angeles, to build a new library as a part of the Watts Civic Center. $1.3 million from Proposition 1, the branch library facility bond issue of 1989, funded the construction of the new Watts library. On June 25, 1996, the city council voted to name the library after Alma Reaves Woods, a woman in the community who encouraged reading and library usage. James C. Moore, AIA &amp; Associates designed the current Watts Library, which opened on June 29, 1996. Los Angeles Public Library operates the Alma Reaves Woods–Watts Branch.

==Community service==

===CicLAvia Tour===
On January 22, 2012, the popular cycling event called CicLAvia took place in south L.A.&#x27;s Central–Alameda neighborhood to the Watts Towers. Volunteers were excited to hold an event close to the CicLAvia events in downtown L.A. The event was meant to encourage civic engagement. Throughout the group of volunteers the diversity was large. Cyclists took photos for a &quot;crowd-source&quot; map made up of photos and recordings by the cyclists.

===Watts Re-Imagined===
Watts Re:Imagined is a local urban planning initiative led by Grant Housing Economic Development Corps (Grant EDC, a non-profit division of the community-based Grant AME church) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Urban Solutions program. Its mission is to help the community of Watts realize their full potential by promoting economic opportunity, social equity, public health, and an improved quality of life, all while working with community leaders to preserve the identity of the area. It is trying to achieve this goal by implementing different existing plans proposed for the area. The Watts Re:Imagined initiative was formed in response to the dissolution of the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles.

==Parks and recreation==

The following recreation facilities are within the Watts boundaries:

* Watts Senior Citizen Center, 1657 East Century Boulevard
* 109th Street Recreation Center, 1464 East 109th Street. The center, which acts as a Los Angeles Police Department stop-in center, has an auditorium, a lighted baseball diamond, lighted indoor and outdoor basketball courts, a children&#x27;s play area, a lighted football field, an indoor gymnasium with weights, an outdoor gymnasium without weights, a lighted soccer field, and lighted tennis courts. The 109th Street Pool is a seasonal outdoor unheated pool. In June 2008, a group of young men attacked a manager there, forcing the city to close the pool for a short period of time. When it re-opened, police were stationed there. The pool, located between the Nickerson Gardens and Jordan Downs public housing complexes, also lay between two competing gangs in 2008.

==Attractions==
===Watts Towers===

The Watts Towers or Towers of Simon Rodia is a collection of 17 interconnected structures, two of which reach heights of over 99 feet (30 m). The Towers were built by Italian immigrant construction worker Sabato (&quot;Sam&quot; or &quot;Simon&quot;) Rodia in his spare time over a period of 33 years, from 1921 to 1954. The work is an example of non-traditional vernacular architecture and American Naïve art.

===Watts Station===

The Watts station was a train station built in 1904. It is a National Historic Landmark. It has been known as one of the few structures that were untouched by a huge fire along 103rd Street stores during the 1965 Watts riots. When it was found intact, it was a symbol of hope and faith for the Watts community. Being one of the most original buildings that was first constructed in Watts, it was a popular stop for the Pacific Electric Railway&#x27;s &quot;Red Car&quot; that ran through Los Angeles, CA, to Long Beach, CA, for 50 years. It was also admitted to the NRHP (National Register of Historic Places) four months after the riots.

===Watts Christmas Parade===
The Watts Christmas parade was created in 1964 by Edna Aliewine before the Watts riots. She put together a group of local volunteers to fundraise and create the parade. Ms. Aliewine started a drill team with neighborhood girls which marched in homemade Santa hats. She died at the age of 90 in her home in Watts on July 5, 2011.

===Watts Summer Games===

==Transportation==
Watts was situated at a point on a rail line that ran south from Los Angeles (eight miles to the north) to Long Beach and, according to real estate advertisements and publicity releases, was about minutes from the terminal at Sixth and Main Streets. In 1910 it was a transfer point for the Santa Ana, Long Beach and San Pedro lines of the Pacific Electric system. The Watts Station, which is now a National Historic Landmark, included Wells Fargo Express and Western Union telegraph facilities. Pioneer settler A. E. Ruoff recalled that the electric line was installed about 1902. The point known as Latin Station, just a mile north of Watts station, was called North Watts, and Abila station, 1.5 miles south of Watts, was South Watts (later &quot;Palomar&quot;).

Around 1905, a junction was installed for a line that ran to Santa Ana.
In February 1909 the railroad changed its schedule so that Watts travelers would have to take local trains rather than expresses, thereby increasing the length of the ride to Los Angeles from 15 minutes to one hour. In 1912 Watts passengers could get a car into Los Angeles about every three minutes, and those returning from the city &quot;have the choice of riding five different lines of cars, not to mention the Watts locals, namely the Long Beach, Santa Ana, San Pedro, Redondo and Newport lines.&quot;

In 1925, there were 800 freight and passenger trains stopping in Watts, and &quot;a great number of wide boulevards&quot; passed through the city.

===Public transportation===
Watts is currently served by the 103rd Street/Watts Towers station on the LA Metro Rail A Line.

Historically, the neighborhood was served by the Pacific Electric Watts Station and several Pacific Electric lines, including the Watts Line.

<doc id="432032" wikidata="Q6159088" url="?curid=432032" title="Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory">
<text>Vice-Admiral Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory, (8 July 1634 – 30 July 1680) was an Irish soldier and politician. He was the eldest son of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond but predeceased his father and therefore never succeeded as duke.

== Birth and origins ==
Thomas was born on 8 July 1634, at Kilkenny Castle. He was the eldest son of James Butler and his wife Elizabeth Preston. His father was then the 12th Earl of Ormond but would be raised to marquess and duke. His family, the Butler dynasty, is Old English and descends from Theobald Walter, who had been appointed Chief Butler of Ireland by King Henry II in 1177.

Thomas&#x27;s mother was a second cousin once removed of his father as she was a granddaughter of Black Tom, the 10th Earl of Ormond. Her father, however, was Scottish, Richard Preston, 1st Earl of Desmond, a favourite of James I. Both parents were Protestants. They had married on Christmas Day 1629.

He had three surviving brothers and two sisters, who are listed in his father&#x27;s article.










== Early life ==
As the eldest living son, he was the heir apparent and was styled with the corresponding courtesy title, which initially was Viscount Thurles but changed to Earl of Ossory when his father became marquess in 1642. Ossory, as he was after 1642, continued to live with his family in Ireland until 1647 when his father abandoned Dublin to the parliamentarians and Ossory accompanied his father to England. In 1648 his father renewed his support for the royalist cause and Ossory fled with his father to France, arriving in Caen, Normandy, in February 1648. Ossory&#x27;s mother also moved to Caen, where she arrived on 23 June 1648 with his siblings. Ossory was educated at a school in Caen and was an accomplished athlete and a good scholar.

However, the family soon ran into financial problems. In 1652 when Cromwell had completed the conquest of Ireland, his mother brought Ossory and his sibling to London where she obtained a pension of £2000 per year from the income from her Irish estates under the condition that none of that money would be passed on to her husband. In 1655 Ossory was rightly suspected of sympathising with the exiled royalists, and was jailed by Oliver Cromwell. After his release about a year later he went into exile to the Netherlands where Charles II had his exile court at the time.

== Marriage and children ==
On 17 November 1659, while in exile in the Netherlands, Ossory married Emilia van Nassau, the second daughter of Louis of Nassau, Lord of De Lek and Beverweerd.
Thomas and Emilia had eleven children, including two sons:
# James (1665–1745), became the 2nd Duke of Ormonde in 1688
# Charles (1671–1758), became the &quot;de jure&quot; 3rd Duke of Ormonde, following his elder brother&#x27;s attainder in 1715

—and three daughters:
# Elizabeth (died 1717), married William Stanley, 9th Earl of Derby in 1673
# Amelia (died 1760), inherited the estates of her brother Charles and never married
# Henrietta (died 1724), married Henry de Nassau d&#x27;Auverquerque, 1st Earl of Grantham

== Later life ==
In 1660 at the Restoration, Ossory accompanied Charles II back to England. That same year he was appointed Lord of the Bedchamber to Charles II, a post he held until his death. Emilia was naturalised as English by act of Parliament.

In 1661 Ossory became an MP for Bristol in the English and for Dublin University in the Irish house of commons.

In 1662 Ossory was called to the Irish House of Lords under a writ of acceleration as Earl of Ossory. His father had held the title &quot;5th Earl of Ossory&quot; as one of his subsidiary titles. The acceleration made Thomas Butler the 6th Earl of Ossory.

In 1665 Ossory was appointed lieutenant-general in the Irish army. In 1665 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–1667), a fortunate accident allowed Ossory to take part in the Battle of Lowestoft against the Dutch.

He was created an English peer as Baron Butler of Moore Park by being summoned to the English House of Lords by a writ on 17 September 1666. Almost as soon as he appeared in the House of Lords, he was imprisoned for two days for challenging the Duke of Buckingham.

He acted as deputy for his father, who was lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and in parliament he defended Ormond&#x27;s Irish administration with great vigour.

On 12 March 1672 he attacked the Dutch Smyrna fleet with HMS Resolution, starting the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672–1674) in an action that he is said to have greatly regretted later in life. 

In May 1672 he fought against the same enemies in the Battle of Solebay, serving with great distinction on both occasions. 

While visiting France in 1672, he rejected the liberal offers made by Louis XIV to induce him to enter the service of France.

In August 1673 he added to his high reputation by his conduct during the Battle of Texel in August 1673. From 1677 until 1679, he served alongside his father as a Lord of the Admiralty.

Ossory was intimate with William, Prince of Orange, and in 1677 he joined the allied army in the Netherlands, commanding the British contingent and excelling at the siege of Mons in 1678. 

In 1680 he was appointed governor of English Tangier, but his death prevented him from taking up his new duties.

== Death, succession, and timeline ==
Ossory died on 30 July 1680 at Arlington House in London. He was buried provisionally in Westminster Abbey on 31 July 1680. The ceremony of burial was performed belatedly on 13 November 1680. Some say Ossory&#x27;s body was later taken to Ireland and reburied in the family vault in St Canice&#x27;s Cathedral, Kilkenny. James, his eldest son, succeeded him as the 7th Earl of Ossory and would in 1688 become the 2nd Duke of Ormond.

<doc id="432033" wikidata="Q5902725" url="?curid=432033" title="Horatio Luro">
<text>Horatio A. Luro (February 27, 1901 - December 16, 1991) was a thoroughbred horse racing trainer in the United States.

Luro was born in Argentina as one of nine children into the wealthy family of rancher and meat packer Adolfo Luro. The family had been involved for several generations with the lucrative business of polo horses, and Horatio Luro grew up as something of a playboy and maintained this lifestyle after moving to the United States. Well connected, he was friends with the social and business elite who could afford to be involved in the costly sport of thoroughbred racing. One of those elite was Canada&#x27;s E. P. Taylor (1901–1989), chairman of a giant business conglomerate, the founder of the Jockey Club of Canada, and later the president of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association. Taylor hired Luro to run his Windfields Farm, a large breeding and racing operation with two farms in Ontario and another in Chesapeake City, Maryland.

In a career that spanned 48 years from 1937 to 1984, Luro trained 43 Stakes winners and 3 Champions. He won the 1962 Kentucky Derby with California-bred Decidedly and two years later won both the Derby and the Preakness Stakes with Northern Dancer, a horse who went on to be the 20th century&#x27;s greatest sire. Luro also trained three winners of the Canadian International Stakes: Eugenia II (1956), Spinney (1957), and One For All (1971).

While running Windfields Farm, Luro oversaw the breeding of Nijinsky II and from 1960 to 1969 won more races than any other breeding farm in North America. Luro trained three horses that won Canada&#x27;s most prestigious thoroughbred horse racing event, the Queen&#x27;s Plate.

Luro basked in the publicity surrounding his racing success, associating with the rich and famous including Hollywood stars such as Bing Crosby while his dashing personality and good looks saw him dating some of society&#x27;s most glamorous women. In the 1950s, he dated and eventually married the former Frances Weinman Latimer, daughter of Georgia mining and chemical products magnate William Weinman. He subsequently developed a breeding and training facility on her family&#x27;s land in Cartersville, Georgia, operating under the name &quot;Old Mill Farm&quot;. Despite training activities throughout the United States and Canada, it was at this location that he and his wife Frances raised their family. While no longer performing thoroughbred racing operations, Old Mill Farm remains in the hands of Luro&#x27;s grandson, and an equestrian facility still operates on the site.

In 1980, Luro was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. On Sunday, December 16, 1991, Luro died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Bal Harbour, Florida, at the age of 90. He is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Cartersville, Georgia.

<text>Early British popular music, in the sense of commercial music enjoyed by the people, can be seen to originate in the 16th and 17th centuries with the arrival of the broadside ballad as a result of the print revolution, which were sold cheaply and in great numbers until the 19th century. Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the 19th century, including the brass band, which produced a popular and communal form of classical music. Similarly, the music hall sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts. In the 1930s, the influence of American Jazz led to the creation of British dance bands, who provided a social and popular music that began to dominate social occasions and the radio airwaves.

==Broadside ballads==

 Broadside ballads were arguably the first form of commercial popular music in Britain. They were a product of the development of cheap print from the 16th century. They were generally printed on one side of a large sheet of poor quality paper. This could also be cut in half lengthways to make ‘broadslips’, or folded to make chapbooks. They were produced in huge numbers, with over 400,000 being sold in England annually by the 1660s. Many were sold by travelling chapmen in city streets or at fairs. The subject matter varied from what has been defined as the traditional ballad, although many traditional ballads were printed as broadsides. Among the topics were love, religion, drinking-songs, legends and early journalism, which included disasters, political events and signs, wonders and prodigies.

==Brass bands==

Although most of the instruments used by British brass bands had existed and had been used together for some time, they only became a mass activity in the 1840s and 1850s out of village, church and military bands. Brass bands were a response to the process of industrialisation, which produced a large working class population, technological advancements, including more efficient piston valve instruments, which were easier to play and more accurate, and mass production that could quickly produce and distribute the instruments. Arguably, brass bands were an expression of the local solidarity and aspirations of newly formed or rapidly growing communities. This was particularly expressed in the rapid growth and organisation of bands, clearly seen in the creation of brass band competitions by the late 1850s. Brass bands probably reached their peak of popularity in the early decades of the 20th century, when, it has been estimated, there were over 20,000 brass band instrumentalists in the country.

==Parlour music==
&quot;Parlour music&quot; was popular music performed in the parlours of middle class homes by amateur singers and pianists. Disseminated as sheet music, its heyday came in the 19th century as a result of a steady increase in the number of households with enough surplus cash to purchase musical instruments and instruction in music and with the leisure time and cultural motivation to engage in recreational music-making. In contrast to the chord-based classical music, parlour music features melodies, which are harmonically independent or not determined by the harmony. Many of the earliest parlour songs were transcriptions for voice and keyboard of other music, such as Thomas Moore&#x27;s &quot;Irish Melodies&quot;, which comprised traditional tunes with new lyrics. Other genres performed included arias from Italian operas, patriotic selections, religious songs and pieces written for the musical stage, including excerpts from blackface minstrel shows. As the 19th century wore on, more and more songs were newly composed specifically for use by amateurs at home and these pieces began to develop a style all their own: similar in melodic and harmonic content to art songs of the day, but shorter and simpler in structure and making fewer technical demands on singer and accompanist. The high point of the parlour song came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in North America and the British Isles. Songs became more complex and sophisticated in their melodic and harmonic vocabulary and, in addition to their continuing use in the parlour, were also often sung in public recitals by professional singers. Characteristic and popular parlour songs include &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot; by Henry Bishop with lyrics by John Howard Payne, &quot;The Old Arm Chair&quot; by Henry Russell, &quot;The Lost Chord&quot; composed by Arthur Sullivan with lyrics by Adelaide A. Proctor and &quot;Take Back the Heart&quot; by Claribel (Mrs. Charlotte Barnard).

==Music hall==

Music hall developed as a result of the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation of previously rural populations in the 19th century. The new urban communities, cut off from their cultural roots, required new and accessible means of entertainment. Music halls were originally bars, which provided entertainment in the form of music and speciality acts for their patrons. By the middle years of the 19th century, the first purpose-built music halls were appearing in London. The halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs that could no longer be met from the traditional folk repertoire. Professional songwriters were enlisted to fill the gap. By the turn of the century, music hall was dominated by song-writing companies and theatre chains, such as that of Sir Oswald Stoll. Music hall songs are characterised by a simple beat and a strong melody or tune, which can be easily acquired by the audience. Typically, a music hall song consists of a series of verses sung by the performer alone and a repeated chorus, which carries the principal melody and in which the audience is encouraged to join. Leading music hall stars included: Marie Lloyd, Harry Champion, George Formby, Vesta Tilley, Gus Elen, Little Tich, Gracie Fields and Flanagan and Allen. Musical hall composers included Lionel Monckton, Felix Powell and Noel Gay.

==Dance bands (big bands)==
From about 1925 to 1946 the most popular form of music in the UK was that produced by dance bands. The British bands never quite adopted the kind of &quot;Swing&quot; music that was generally associated American &quot;Big Band&quot; jazz. It was quite tame compared to American jazz and was generally more sweet. Billy Cotton had perhaps the longest fame, as he still had a prime-time TV programme until the late &#x27;60s. The fame of Ted Heath lasted until 1964. Fans tended to divide them into &quot;Sweet&quot; (Ambrose, Geraldo and Victor Silvester) and &quot;Hot&quot; (Harry Roy and Nat Gonella). Jack Hylton&#x27;s band was &quot;hot&quot; until 1933, then became sweeter as their success grew. Some of the lead singers enjoyed fame on their own. Most famous were Al Bowlly and Leslie &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson.

<doc id="432036" wikidata="Q7142474" url="?curid=432036" title="Passage of Arms">
<text>Passage of Arms is a 1959 novel by Eric Ambler.

==Plot==

Girija Krishnan, a bookkeeper at a rubber plantation in Malaya, has one ambition in life: to found and establish a local bus company and transport system. But he has no money to finance this endeavor.

The local authorities kill a gang of Communist terrorists near the plantation, and Girija realizes from the condition of their guns that their cache of weapons must be somewhere nearby. By slow, hard work and some good luck, he succeeds in finding it. 

He waits several years until he can safely sell the weapons to a Chinese family of entrepreneurs centered in Singapore. Members of the family include the respectable businessman Tan Siow Mong, who runs the transport company which regularly exports the rubber plantation&#x27;s crop; also the labor racketeer and compulsive gambler Tan Yam Heng, who always needs money; and the streetwise Tan Tak Chee.

When Girija sells the weapons to the Tan family, they realize that in order to re-sell them safely for profit, they need to find a respectable European or American foreigner who can take legal responsibility for the transfer of funds from the eventual buyer. They find Greg Nilsen and his wife Dorothy, a pair of naive American tourists from Delaware, who are taking a round-the-world cruise. A taxi-driver in Singapore called Khoo Ah Au (&quot;Jimmy&quot; to English-speaking tourists) recruits the Nilsens with a promise of a handsome fee for signing the transfers of inventory and money. Greg is happy to do so when Jimmy tells him that the weapons will be used to arm anti-Communist insurgents in Sumatra, but his enthusiasm wanes when he learns that in order to complete the transaction, he must travel in person to the Sumatran city of Labuanga and obtain the insurgent leader&#x27;s signature.

Outnumbered by the insurgents, the military governor of Labuanga has allied himself with the local Communist organization. Greg, Dorothy, and their insurgent contacts are caught and imprisoned by Communist agents, who have been intercepting shipments of weapons and turning them over to the governor. The insurgents send a rescue force to attack the prison, and Greg and Dorothy manage to escape with the help of the local American and British consuls. 

Back in Singapore, Greg wants to abandon the arms deal and go home. A cynical British official convinces him otherwise, saying that the insurgents should not be cheated of their weapons after saving Greg and Dorothy&#x27;s lives. The official also prompts Greg to get a bit of revenge against the Tan family by leaving the payment for the weapons in the care of Yam Heng, who promptly loses most of it in irresponsible business dealings. Humbled but relieved, Greg and Dorothy return to Delaware.

Although he has been deprived of any profit from the arms consignment, Tan Siow Mong is still obliged to pay Girija for his part in the scheme. Girija accepts a business partnership in place of the money, and operates his new bus line as a division of Tan&#x27;s shipping company.

==Context==
The title is a double reference to the novel&#x27;s plot and the expression a &quot;passage of arms&quot;.

The Nilsens are an example of the recurrent &quot;innocents abroad&quot; theme that characterizes Ambler&#x27;s novels.

==Reception==

New York Times reviewer James M. Cain, also a thriller-writer in his own right, described the book as &quot;... a picture of Southeast Asia, in all its color and the savagery of its current turmoil ... this is tops, and gets down to bedrock.&quot;

The book won the 1959 Gold Dagger award (then known as the &quot;Crossed Red Herring Award&quot;).

<doc id="432038" wikidata="Q6942409" url="?curid=432038" title="Music of the United Kingdom (1970s)">
<text>Popular music of the United Kingdom in the 1970s built upon the new forms of music developed from blues rock towards the end of the 1960s, including folk rock and psychedelic rock movements. Several important and influential subgenres were created in Britain in this period, by pursuing the limitations of rock music, including British folk rock and glam rock, a process that reached its apogee in the development of progressive rock and one of the most enduring subgenres in heavy metal music. Britain also began to be increasingly influenced by third world music (roots of World music), including Jamaican and Indian music, resulting in new music scenes and subgenres. In the middle years of the decade the influence of the pub rock and American punk rock movements led to the British intensification of punk, which swept away much of the existing landscape of popular music, replacing it with much more diverse new wave and post punk bands who mixed different forms of music and influences to dominate rock and pop music into the 1980s.

==Rock==
===Progressive rock===
Progressive or &#x27;prog rock&#x27; developed out of late 1960s blues-rock and psychedelic rock. Dominated by British bands it was part of an attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility. Progressive rock bands attempted to push the technical and compositional boundaries of rock by going beyond the standard verse-chorus-based song structures. The arrangements often incorporated elements drawn from classical, jazz, and world music. Instrumentals were common, while songs with lyrics were sometimes conceptual, abstract, or based in fantasy. Progressive rock bands sometimes used &quot;concept albums that made unified statements, usually telling an epic story or tackling a grand overarching theme.&quot; King Crimson have been seen as the band who established the concept of progressive rock&quot;. The term was applied to the music of bands and artists such as Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Kate Bush, Soft Machine, and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. It reached its peak of popularity in the mid-1970s, but had mixed critical acclaim and the punk movement can be seen as a reaction against its musicality and perceived pomposity.

===British rock mainstream===
Some British rock bands that began their careers in the British Invasion 60s, notably The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Kinks, also developed their own particular styles and expanded their international fan base during 1970s, but would be joined by new acts in new styles and subgenres.

UK mainstream rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. It reached its peak in the mid- to late 1970s with acts like the reformed Fleetwood Mac, whose &quot;Rumours&quot; (1977) was the best selling album of the decade. Major British soft rock artists of the 1970s included 10cc, Mungo Jerry and ELO. A large number of mainstream rock songs fit into the singer-songwriter classification. Some of the actives were Cat Stevens, Steve Winwood and Elton John. Kate Bush became the first solo woman to have a self-written song become a number 1 UK single and became a sensation, drawing on art rock, literature, dance and mime.

===Hard rock and Heavy metal===

The hard rock and heavy metal genres were developed from blues-rock in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in England and the United States. Played louder and with more intensity, it often emphasised the electric guitar, both as a rhythm instrument using simple repetitive riffs and as a solo lead instrument, and was more likely to be used with distortion and other effects. Key acts included British Invasion bands like The Who and The Kinks, as well as psychedelic era performers like Cream, Jimi Hendrix Experience and The Jeff Beck Group. Adopting a form of boogie rock, Status Quo became one of the UK&#x27;s leading rock bands throughout the rest of the 1970s.

From the late 1960s the term heavy metal began to be used to describe some hard rock played with even more volume and intensity. By 1970 three key British bands had developed the characteristic sounds and styles which would help shape the subgenre. Led Zeppelin added elements of fantasy to their riff laden blues-rock, Deep Purple brought in symphonic and medieval interests from their progressive rock phase and Black Sabbath introduced facets of the gothic and modal harmony, helping to produce a &quot;darker&quot; sound. These elements were taken up by a &quot;second generation&quot; of heavy metal bands into the late 1970s. Rainbow helped turn the genre into a form of arena rock; Judas Priest helped spur the genre&#x27;s evolution by discarding much of its blues influence and Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Bands in the new wave of British heavy metal, such as Iron Maiden and Saxon, followed in a similar vein. Unlike progressive rock, heavy metal (already a minority sub-culture) was able to survive the rise of punk and electronic music intact. Despite a lack of airplay and very little presence on the singles charts, late-1970s heavy metal built a considerable following, particularly among adolescent working-class males in North America and Europe.

===Glam rock===
Glam or glitter rock was developed in the UK in the post-hippie early 1970s. It was characterised by outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots. The flamboyant lyrics, costumes, and visual styles of glam performers were a campy, playing with categories of sexuality in a theatrical blend of nostalgic references to science fiction and old movies, all over a guitar-driven hard rock sound. Pioneers of the genre included Marc Bolan and T.Rex, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Mott the Hoople. These, and many other acts straddled the divide between pop and rock music, managing to maintain a level of respectability with rock audiences, while enjoying success in the singles chart, including Queen and Elton John. Other performers aimed much more directly for the popular music market, where they were the dominant groups of their era, including Slade and Sweet. The glitter image was pushed to its limits by Gary Glitter and The Glitter Band. Largely confined to the British, glam rock peaked during the mid-1970s, before it disappeared in the face of punk rock and new wave trends.

===British folk rock===

British folk rock was developed in Britain during the mid to late 1960s by the bands Fairport Convention, and Pentangle which built on elements of American folk rock, and on the second British folk revival. Rather than mixing electric music with forms of American influenced progressive folk, it used traditional English music as its basis. A significant moment was the release of Fairport Convention&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot;, which developed further in the 1970s, when it was taken up by groups such as Pentangle, Steeleye Span and the Albion Band. It was rapidly adopted and developed in the surrounding Celtic cultures of Brittany, where it was pioneered by Alan Stivell and bands like Malicorne; in Ireland by groups such as Horslips; and also in Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man and Cornwall, to produce Celtic rock and its derivatives. It was also influential in those parts of the world with close cultural connections to Britain, such as the US and Canada and gave rise to the subgenre of Medieval folk rock and the fusion genres of folk punk and folk metal. By the end of the 1970s the genre was in steep decline in popularity, as other forms of music, including punk and electronic began to be established.

===Pub rock===

Pub rock was a short-lived trend that left a lasting influence on the British music scene, especially in punk rock. It was a back-to-basics movement that reacted against the glittery glam rock of David Bowie and Gary Glitter, and peaked in the mid-1970s. Pub rock developed in large north London pubs. and is said to have begun in May 1971 with Eggs over Easy, an American band, playing in the Tally Ho! in Kentish Town. A group of musicians who had been playing in blues and R&amp;B bands during the 1960s and early 70s soon formed influential bands like Brinsley Schwarz, Ducks Deluxe. Brinsley Schwarz was probably the most influential group, achieving some mainstream success both in the UK and in the States. The second wave of pub rock included Kilburn and the High Roads, Ace and Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers; these were followed by the third and final wave of pub rock, including Dr. Feelgood, Eddie and the Hot Rods, Ian Dury, Nick Lowe and Sniff &#x27;n&#x27; the Tears. Several pub rock musicians joined the new wave acts such as Graham Parker&#x27;s backing band, The Rumour, Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions and even The Clash.

===Punk rock===

Punk rock developed between 1974 and 1976, originally in the United States, where it was rooted in garage rock, and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music. This was taken up in Britain by bands also influenced by the pub rock scene and US punk rock, like the Sex Pistols and The Clash, The Damned, The Jam, The Stranglers, Generation X, The Buzzcocks, Sham 69, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Tom Robinson Band, who became the vanguard of a new musical and cultural movement, blending simple aggressive sounds and lyrics with clothing styles and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies. Punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock, creating fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraced a DIY (do it yourself) ethic, with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels. 1977 saw punk rock spreading around the world, and it became a major international cultural phenomenon. However, by 1978, the initial impulse had subsided and punk had morphed into the wider and more diverse new wave and post punk movements.

===Post punk===

During the second half of the 1970s and early 1980s musicians identifying with or inspired by Punk rock also pursued a broad range of other variations, giving rise among others to the post-punk movement. The genre retained its roots in the punk movement but was more introverted, complex and experimental. Post-punk laid the groundwork for alternative rock by broadening the range of punk and underground music, incorporating elements of Krautrock (particularly the use of synthesisers and extensive repetition), Jamaican dub music (specifically in bass guitar), American funk, studio experimentation, and even punk&#x27;s traditional polar opposite, disco, into the genre.

During 1976–77, in the midst of the original UK punk movement, bands emerged such as Manchester&#x27;s Joy Division, The Fall, and Magazine, Leeds&#x27; Gang of Four, and London&#x27;s The Raincoats that became central post-punk figures. Some bands classified as post-punk, such as Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, had been active well before the punk scene coalesced; others, such as The Slits and Siouxsie and the Banshees, transitioned from punk rock into post-punk.

===New wave===
As the initial punk impulse began to subside, with the major punk bands either disbanding or taking on new influences, the term new wave began to be used to describe particularly British bands that emerged in the later 1970s with mainstream appeal. These included pop bands like XTC, Squeeze and Nick Lowe, the electronic rock of Gary Numan as well as songwriters like Elvis Costello, rock &amp; roll influenced bands like the Pretenders, the reggae influenced music of bands like The Police, as well as bands of the ska revival like The Specials, The Beat, and Madness. By the end of the decade many of these bands, most obviously the Police, were beginning to make an impact in American and world markets. Significant popular British New Wave acts at the end of the decade included The Boomtown Rats, Ian Dury and the Blockheads, and Lene Lovich.

===Synth rock===

Many progressive rock bands had incorporated synthesisers into their sound, including Pink Floyd, Yes and Genesis. In 1977 Ultravox member Warren Cann purchased a Roland TR-77 drum machine, which was first featured in their October 1977 single release &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot;. The ballad arrangement, metronome-like percussion and heavy use of the ARP Odyssey synthesiser was effectively a prototype for nearly all synth pop and rock bands that were to follow. In 1978, the first incarnation of The Human League released their début single &quot;Being Boiled&quot;. Others were soon to follow, including Tubeway Army, a little-known outfit from West London, who dropped their punk rock image and jumped on the band wagon, topping the UK charts in the summer of 1979 with the single &quot;Are Friends Electric?&quot;. This prompted the singer, Gary Numan to go solo and in the same year he release the Kraftwerk inspired album, &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; and again topped the charts for the second time with the single &quot;Cars&quot;. Particularly through its adoption by New Romantics, synthesisers came to dominate the pop and rock music of the early 80s. Albums such as Visage&#x27;s &quot;Visage&quot; (1980), John Foxx&#x27;s &quot;Metamatic&quot; (1980), Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Telekon&quot; (1980), Ultravox&#x27;s &quot;Vienna&quot; (1980), The Human League&#x27;s &quot;Dare&quot; (1981) and Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; (1981), established a sound that influenced most mainstream pop and rock bands, until it began to fall from popularity in the mid-1980s.

==Pop==

The early 1970s were probably the decade when British pop music was most dependent on the group format, with pop acts, like rock bands, playing guitars and drums, with occasional additions of keyboard or orchestration. Some of these groups were in some sense &quot;manufactured&quot;, but many were competent musicians, playing on their own recordings and writing their own material. In addition to the glam and glitter rock bands who enjoyed considerable success in the early 1970s. Aiming much more for the teen market, partly in response to US pop groups were The Rubettes and The Bay City Rollers. Largely vocal-based groups included the New Seekers, Brotherhood of Man, the last of these designed as a British answer to ABBA. Individuals who enjoyed successful pop careers in this period included Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan, David Essex, Leo Sayer, Rod Stewart and Elton John. In addition there were the rock and roll revivalists Mud, Showaddywaddy and Alvin Stardust. This pattern changed radically in the late 1970s as a result of the impact of punk rock.

==Folk music==

Perhaps the finest individual work in the genre was from artists early 1970s artists like Nick Drake, and John Martyn, but these can also be considered the first among the British &#x27;folk troubadours&#x27; or &#x27;singer-songwriters&#x27;, individual performers who remained largely acoustic, but who relied mostly on their own individual compositions. The most successful of these was Ralph McTell, whose ‘Streets of London’ reached number 2 in the UK Single Charts in 1974, and whose music is clearly folk, but without and much reliance on tradition, virtuosity, or much evidence of attempts at fusion with other genres.

==British soul/jazz==

Carl Douglas got #1 hits &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; (1974), and Biddu Orchestra records also appeared in the charts. &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; in particular sold eleven million records worldwide. Popularity of British jazz from the 1950s, 1960s with Kenny Ball and Chris Barbar, UK jazz continued with innovative music scene. Some of the technical musicians during this period include guitarist John McLaughlin and Dave Holland (both of whom joined Miles Davis&#x27;s group), pianists Keith Tippett and John Taylor, saxophonists Evan Parker, Mike Osborne, and the Canadian-born trumpeter Kenny Wheeler who had settled in Britain. In the 1970s a notable development was the creation of various British jazz rock bands like Soft Machine, Nucleus, Colosseum, Henry Cow(avant garde band), National Health and Ginger Baker&#x27;s Air Force, making it a major influence on progressive rock music.

==Industrial music==

Industrial music was an experimental music style, often including electronic music, that drew on transgressive and provocative themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s to describe Industrial Records artists. It blended avant-garde electronics experiments (including tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesisers, sequencers) and a punk sensibility. The first industrial artists experimented with noise and controversial topics. Their production was not limited to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms. Prominent industrial musicians include the Sheffield based groups Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire. While the term was initially self-applied by a small coterie of groups and individuals associated with Industrial Records, it broadened to include artists influenced by the original movement or using an industrial aesthetic.

==Jamaican music==
Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae had been introduced to the United Kingdom in the 1960s, largely due to the Windrush immigration of the 60&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s, and the genres became especially popular with Mods, skinheads and suedeheads. The 1970s saw the first major flowering of British reggae with bands such as The Cimarons, Aswad and Matumbi. Jamaican music began to influence British pop music, punk rock and the 2 Tone genre with the rise of the (often interracial) bands, such as The Specials, Madness, The Selecter and The Beat. Many of these Jamaican-influenced UK bands (such as UB40) adopted pop styles to appeal to mainstream audiences, but some UK reggae bands (such as Steel Pulse) played songs with more confrontational socio-political lyrics. The 1970s also saw the rise of dub poetry, exemplified by Linton Kwesi Johnson, Sister Netifa and Benjamin Zephaniah. The reggae subgenre lovers rock originated in the UK in the 1970s, and the Louisa Marks song &quot;Caught You in a Lie&quot; helped popularise the genre.

<text>Popular music of the United Kingdom in the 1980s built on the post-punk and new wave movements, incorporating different sources of inspiration from subgenres and what is now classed as world music in the shape of Jamaican and Indian music. It also explored the consequences of new technology and social change in the electronic music of synthpop. In the early years of the decade, while subgenres like heavy metal music continued to develop separately, there was a considerable crossover between rock and more commercial popular music, with a large number of more &quot;serious&quot; bands, like The Police and UB40, enjoying considerable single chart success.

The advent of MTV and cable video helped spur what has been seen as a Second British Invasion in the early years of the decade, with British bands enjoying more success in America than they had since the height of the Beatles&#x27; popularity in the 1960s. However, by the end of the decade a fragmentation has been observed, with many new forms of music and sub-cultures, including hip hop and house music, while the single charts were once again dominated by pop artists, now often associated with the Hi-NRG hit factory of Stock Aitken Waterman. The rise of the indie rock scene was partly a response to this, and marked a shift away from the major music labels and towards the importance of local scenes like Madchester and subgenres, like gothic rock.

==Rock==
=== New wave and New Romantics ===

New Romantic music emerged in London nightclubs including Billy&#x27;s and the Blitz Club towards the end of the 1970s. Influenced by David Bowie and Roxy Music, it developed glam rock fashions, gaining its name from the frilly fop shirts of early Romanticism. New Romantic music often made extensive use of synthesisers. Pioneers included Visage and Ultravox and among the commercially most successful acts associated with the movement were Adam and the Ants, Culture Club, Spandau Ballet and Duran Duran. By about 1983 the original movement had dissolved, with surviving acts dropping most of the fashion elements to pursue mainstream careers.

===Post-punk===

Some of the most successful post punk bands in the 1970s, such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and The Psychedelic Furs, also continued their success during the 1980s. Members of Bauhaus and Joy Division explored new stylistic territory as Love and Rockets and New Order respectively. The second generation of British post-punk bands that broke through in the early 1980s, in, tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes. Some, such as Gang of Four, shifted to a more commercial new wave sound, while others moved into gothic rock or became early examples of indie rock.

===Gothic rock===
Gothic rock, often shortened to goth, developed out of the post-punk scene in the early 1980s. It combines dark, often keyboard-heavy music with introspective and depressing lyrics. Notable early gothic rock bands include Bauhaus (whose &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot; is often cited as the first goth record), Siouxsie and the Banshees (who may have coined the term), The Cure, The Sisters of Mercy, and Fields of the Nephilim. Gothic rock gave rise to a broader goth subculture that included clubs, various fashion trends and numerous publications that grew in popularity in the 1980s, gaining notoriety by being associated by several moral panics over suicide and Satanism.

===Indie rock===
Indie or independent rock (often described as alternative rock in the U.S.), was a scene that emerged from post-punk and new wave eschewing the major record labels for control of their own music and relying on local scenes or national sub-cultures to provide an audience. Having enjoyed some success a number of indie acts were able to move into the mainstream, including early indie bands Aztec Camera, Orange Juice and The Smiths, followed by The Housemartins and James. The &quot;C86&quot; cassette, released in 1986 by &quot;NME&quot; and featuring such bands as The Wedding Present, Primal Scream, The Pastels, and the Soup Dragons, was a major influence on the development of indie pop and the British indie scene as a whole.

Other forms of alternative rock developed in the UK during the 1980s. The Jesus and Mary Chain wrapped their pop melodies in walls of guitar noise, while New Order emerged from the demise of post-punk band Joy Division and experimented with techno and house music, forging the alternative dance style. The Mary Chain, along with Dinosaur Jr and the dream pop of Cocteau Twins, were the influences for the shoegazing movement of the late 1980s. Named for the bandmembers&#x27; tendency to stare at their feet onstage, shoegazing acts like My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Ride, and Lush created an overwhelmingly loud &quot;wash of sound&quot; that obscured vocals and melodies with long, droning riffs, distortion, and feedback. Shoegazing bands dominated the British music press at the end of the decade along with the drug-fuelled Madchester scene. Based around The Haçienda, a nightclub in Manchester owned by New Order and Factory Records, Madchester bands such as The Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays mixed acid house dance rhythms with melodic guitar pop.

===Heavy metal===
In the 1980s, the new wave of British heavy metal broke into the mainstream, as albums by Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Saxon reached the British top 10. Many metal artists, including Def Leppard, benefited from the exposure they received on MTV and became the inspiration for American glam metal. However, as the subgenre fragmented into various subgenres, much of the creative impetus shifted towards America and continental Europe (particularly Germany and Scandinavia), which produced most of the major new subgenres of metal, which were then taken up by British acts. These included thrash metal and death metal, both developed in the US; black metal and power metal, both developed in continental Europe, but influenced by the British band Venom; and doom, which was developed in the US, but which soon were adopted by a number of bands from England, including Pagan Altar and Witchfinder General.

===Grindcore===

Grindcore, or simply grind, emerged during the mid-1980s as an extreme music genre characterised by heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, high speed tempo, blast beats, songs often lasting no more than two minutes (some are seconds long), and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched screams. It drew inspiration from some of the most abrasive music genres – including death metal, industrial music, noise and the more extreme varieties of hardcore punk. Grindcore, as such, was developed during the mid-1980s in the United Kingdom by Napalm Death, a group who emerged from the crust punk scene. Napalm Death inspired other British grindcore groups in the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass and Sore Throat.

===Folk punk===
Folk punk or rogue folk is a fusion of folk music and punk rock, or occasionally other genres, which was pioneered by the London-based Irish band The Pogues in the 1980s. It achieved some mainstream success in the 1980s and, particularly as the subgenre of Celtic punk, has been widely adopted in areas of the Celtic diaspora in North America and Australia and by many bands in continental central and eastern Europe. Unlike earlier Celtic rock and electric folk groups, folk punk groups tend to include relatively little traditional music in their repertoire, but instead usually performed their own compositions, often following the form of punk rock, using additional folk instrumentation, including, mandolin, accordion, banjo and particularly violin. Other bands adopted some traditional forms of music, including sea shanties and eastern European gypsy music. Among the most successful performers were The Levellers, and singer-songwriter Billy Bragg, who enjoyed a series of hits in the 1980s.

==Pop==

The British charts at the opening of the 1980s contained the usual mix of imports, novelty acts, oddities (including rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll revivalist Shakin&#x27; Stevens) and survivors like Queen and David Bowie, but were dominated by post punk, and then from about 1981 by new romantic acts. There were also more conventional pop acts, including Bucks Fizz, whose light lyrics and simple tempos gave them three number ones after their Eurovision Song Contest victory in 1981.

The dance-pop music of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, initially controversial, gave them three consecutive number ones in 1984, until they faded away in the mid-1980s. Perhaps the most successful British pop band of the era were the duo Wham! with an unusual mix of disco, soul, ballads and even rap, who had eleven top ten hits in the UK, six of them number ones, between 1982 and 1986. Another band that dominated the charts within the early to mid-1980s were Culture Club with a blend of soul, rock, pop, new wave and reggae gathered them nine top ten hits and two number ones until they broke up in 1986. In the second half of the 1980s, British pop music was dominated by Stock Aitken Waterman&#x27;s &quot;hit factory&quot; with the uniformity of their Hi-NRG sound.

===Synth-pop===
Synth-pop emerged from new wave, producing a form of pop music that followed electronic rock pioneers in the 1960s and 1970s like Kraftwerk, Jean Michel Jarre and Tangerine Dream, in which the synthesiser is the dominant musical instrument. Tubeway Army, a little known outfit from West London, dropped their punk rock image and topped the UK charts in 1979 with the single &quot;Are Friends Electric?&quot;, prompting their singer, Gary Numan to go solo and release the album, &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; from which he gained a number one in the singles charts with &quot;Cars&quot;.

Trevor Horn of the Buggles captured the changing scene in the international hit &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;. It also became dominant for many New Romantic acts like Visage, Ultravox, Duran Duran and Japan. There were also more straight forwardly new wave pop acts like the Human League as well as Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, and Yazoo. Other key artists from the early to mid-1980s include Eurythmics, Talk Talk, A Flock of Seagulls, Tears for Fears, New Order, Pet Shop Boys, OMD, Thomas Dolby, Thompson Twins, Bronski Beat, Heaven 17, Howard Jones, Blancmange and Erasure.

===Hi-NRG===
Hi-NRG (&quot;high energy&quot;) is high-tempo disco music (often with electronic instrumentation), as well as a more specific, derivative genre of electronic dance music that achieved mainstream popularity in the mid to late 1980s. In the early 1980s hi energy disco had become popular in the gay scene of American cities like New York and San Francisco with acts like Divine, and The Weather Girls. In 1983 in the UK, music magazine &quot;Record Mirror&quot; championed the gay underground sound and began publishing a weekly Hi-NRG Chart.

Hi-NRG also entered the mainstream with hits in the UK singles chart, such as Hazell Dean&#x27;s &quot;Searchin&#x27; (I Gotta Find a Man)&quot; and Evelyn Thomas&#x27;s &quot;High Energy&quot;. In the mid-1980s, Hi-NRG producers in the dance and the main singles charts included Ian Levine and trio Stock Aitken Waterman, both of whom worked with many different artists. Stock Aitken Waterman had three of the most successful Hi-NRG singles ever with their productions of Dead or Alive&#x27;s &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot; (UK No. 1 &amp; US No. 11 in 1985), Bananarama&#x27;s &quot;Venus&quot; (US No. 1 &amp; UK No. 8 in 1986), and Rick Astley&#x27;s &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; (UK No. 1 &amp; US No. 1 in 1987). Their artists dominated British pop music and the charts in the late 1980s, including Bananarama, Rick Astley and Australian actress Kylie Minogue.

==UK soul==
In 1980s, UK soul musicians such as Junior, Princess, the Pasadenas, Mica Paris, Soul II Soul, and Central Line played soul music and had hit songs. Soul II Soul&#x27;s breakthrough R&amp;B hits &quot;Keep on Movin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Back to Life&quot; in 1989 have been seen as opening the door to the mainstream for black British soul and R&amp;B performers.

Britain had produced some blue-eyed soul singers in the 1960s, including Tom Jones and Dusty Springfield and interest had been maintained by figures such as David Bowie, but it was not until the 1980s that a clear genre of British soul music developed with flourishing soul scenes in major cities like London and Manchester, often with many black artists, supported by local and pirate radio stations. This interest was reflected in a series of covers or songs inspired by soul for a number of major acts, including Phil Collins&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; (1982), Culture Club&#x27;s &quot;Church of the Poison Mind&quot; (1983), The Style Council&#x27;s &quot;Shout to the Top&quot;, (1984) Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Missionary Man&quot; (1986), and Steve Winwood &quot;Roll with It&quot; (1988).

For the first time since the 1960s, there were also significant acts who specialised in soul. Former Wham! singer George Michael released the multi-platinum &quot;Faith&quot; album (1987). Also significant were Sade, Swing Out Sister, Simply Red and toward the end of the decade, Lisa Stansfield. In the twenty-first century, bloggers and journalists have decided to categorise Sade and many of these blue-eyed soul singers/white soul acts under new definitions such as the &#x27;New Wave of British Jazz Pop&#x27; and &#x27;sophisti-pop&#x27;, though with the latter term some journalists have also included artists such as Kate Bush, ABC and Talk Talk, with the &#x27;sophistication&#x27; coming from techniques used in the studio rather than a sophisticated jazz-pop/white soul sound.

==Hip hop==
A British hip hop scene emerged in the early 1980s, largely based on American hip hop music at parties and club nights, In this period some pop records dabbled with rap – such as Adam and the Ants&#x27; &quot;Ant Rap&quot; (1981), Wham!&#x27;s &quot;Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)&quot; (1982) and Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot; (1982). More serious British artists were rapping live or recording amateur tapes in the early 1980s, but the first British hip hop tune released on record was &quot;London Bridge&quot; by Newtrament in 1984.

Over the next few years, more UK hip hop and electro was released: &quot;Street Sounds Electro UK&quot; (1984), which was produced by Greg Wilson and featured an early appearance from MC Kermit, who later went on to form the Wilson produced Ruthless Rap Assassins; The Rapologists&#x27; &quot;Kids Rap/Party Rap&quot; (1984), but releases and national publicity were still rare. Mainstream radio did play British hip hop on occasion, and instrumental in giving the scene wider recognition were DJs such as Dave Pearce, Tim Westwood, and John Peel, but in this period it made very little impact on the mainstream charts. The scene remained predominantly underground depending on word of mouth and the patronage of pirate radio stations. The first UK record label devoted to releasing UK hip hop acts was Simon Harris&#x27; Music of Life label, founded in 1986. It was home to Derek B, the first UK rapper to achieve chart success. Music of Life went on to sign groups such as Hijack, the Demon Boyz, Hardnoise (later Son of Noise) and MC Duke. 

Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them – for example Massive Attack with trip hop, or Galliano with acid jazz. &quot;Hip Hop Connection&quot;, the first major British hip hop magazine, was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London – such as Black Radical Mk II and Overlord X – but many distinct scenes developed nationally.

==Electronic music==
In the 1980s, dance music records made using only electronic instruments became increasingly popular, largely influenced from the electronic music of Kraftwerk and disco music. Such music was originally born of and popularised via regional nightclub scenes in the 1980s, and became the predominant type of music played in discothèques as well as the rave scene.

===House music===
House music was a style of electronic dance music that originated in Chicago, Illinois, US, in the early 1980s. House music was strongly influenced by elements of soul and funk-infused varieties of disco. House music generally mimics disco&#x27;s percussion, especially the use of a prominent bass drum on every beat, but may feature a prominent synthesiser bassline, electronic drums, electronic effects, funk and pop samples, and reverb or delay-enhanced vocals. In the early 1980s, a UK house scene developed in cities such as London, Birmingham and Manchester, particularly at The Haçienda Club and on the holiday island of Ibiza.

One of the earliest and most influential UK house and techno record labels was Network Records (otherwise known as Kool Kat records) who helped introduce Italian and U.S. dance music to Britain as well as promoting select UK dance music acts. The first English house tune, &quot;Carino&quot; by T-Coy was released in 1986. By late 1987, DJs like Paul Oakenfold and Danny Rampling were bringing the Ibiza sound to UK clubs like Shoom in Southwark (London), Heaven, Future, Spectrum and Purple Raines in Birmingham. The genre became more well known to the general public when it began to crossover into the mainstream singles chart around 1986, with the song &quot;Love Can&#x27;t Turn Around&quot; by Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk (featuring Darryl Pandy) generally being accredited as the first record to crossover from clubs to charts when it became a top 10 hit that year. Another major milestone for house music was when &quot;Jack Your Body&quot; by American DJ Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley became the first record from the genre to reach the number one spot in the UK Singles Chart in January 1987.

==Jazz fusion==
After the lean years of the 1970s, there was something of a British jazz revival based in London&#x27;s Soho in the 1980s. Initially this UK jazz dance scene was led by DJs like Paul Murphy, but it soon expanded to support live bands and to start its own record labels. The jazz revival was by the appearance of a new generation of British jazz and fusion musicians, including members of the jazz groups Level 42, Incognito, Jazz Warriors (formed 1986), Courtney Pine, Gary Crosby, and later Soweto Kinch. The Acid Jazz label was formed in 1987, producing a mix of hip hop and funk beat flavoured jazz stylings that put traditional jazz elements over modern beats.

==2 Tone and reggae==

Having emerged from the post-punk and reggae scenes in the West Midlands in the 1970s, the ska revival associated with 2 Tone records was a remarkable commercial success in the early years of the 1980s. Bands like The Specials, The Selecter, The Beat, Madness, Bad Manners and The Bodysnatchers all enjoyed chart success, with Madness and The Specials managing number ones. The Specials&#x27; &quot;Ghost Town&quot; (1981) is often seen as summarising the disillusionment of Thatcherite, post-industrial urban youth.

Madness managed to sustain a career that could still chart into the second half of the 1980s, but the 2-tone movement faded early in the decade, and would have a longer term effect through American bands of the third wave of ska. The more reggae based music of UB40 allowed them to continue to chart into the twentieth century, enjoying four number ones in the UK, the last of these in 1994. In the late 1980s, London also developed an early dancehall scene, as documented by the compilation album &quot;Watch How the People Dancing: Unity Sounds from the London Dancehall 1986-1989&quot;.

==Indian music in the UK==
By the mid-1970s, the demand among the relatively large Asian populations of many major British cities for familiar live music to entertain at weddings and other cultural occasions led to a flourishing Asian dance band scene, particularly bhangra from the Punjab which supported bands like Alaap, formed in Southall in London and Bhujhungy Group from Birmingham.

Alaap&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Teri Chunni de Sitare&quot; for Multitone records, mixed traditional dhol and tumbi with synthesisers and electro beats and was a surprise hit to those outside of the scene. It opened the door for a flood of Asian recording artists in the UK including Apna Sangeet, Chirag Pehchan, Sangeeta and DCS.

By the mid-1980s, bhangra was the most popular music among British Asians and a youth scene of daytime bhangra raves were a major part of a growing youth culture. Multitone Records began to release remix albums, and bhangra picked up influences from hip hop and soul, producing groups like X-executive Sounds and Hustlers convention.

Other 1980s forms of British Indian music included the punk rock and rap of Aki Nawaz, the pop of Sheila Chandra, the hip hop of Joi Bangla and Osmani Sounds, and the ghazal/jazz fusion of Najma Akhtar. The decade also saw the first record with clear South Asian influences since the 1960s to enter the British charts, when Monsoon&#x27;s &quot;Ever So Lonely&quot; reached the top ten.

==Second British Invasion==

The Second British Invasion consisted of acts that came mainly out of the synthpop and new wave genres. These acts received exposure in the United States on the cable music channel MTV which launched in 1981. British artists, unlike many of their American counterparts, had learned how to use the music video early on. Several British acts signed to independent labels were able to outmarket and outsell American artists that were signed with major labels.

With considerable boost from MTV airplay during July 1982, The Human League&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; had a three-week reign on top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100 chart, described by the &quot;Village Voice&quot; as the moment the Second British Invasion kicked off. They were followed by bands like Duran Duran, whose glossy videos would come to symbolise the power of MTV. On MTV, British bands were introduced to the American mainstream that probably would not have gained the publicity otherwise. The first band to owe their American success solely down to their glossy music video receiving heavy rotation on MTV were the synthpop band A Flock of Seagulls, whose single &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot; reached No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the summer of 1982. In 1983, 30% of the record sales were from British acts. Eighteen of the top 40 and six of the top 10 singles on 18 July were by British artists. Overall record sales rose by 10% from 1982.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine featured Annie Lennox and Boy George on the cover of one of its issues while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; would release an &quot;England Swings&quot; issue. In April 1984, 40 of the top 100 singles were from British acts while 8 of the top 10 singles in a May 1985 survey were of British origin. In 1984, a majority of acts that signed to independent labels such as The Smiths were mining various rock influences becoming an alternative to the Second Invasion. MTV continued its heavy rotation of videos by Second Invasion acts until 1987.

<doc id="432041" wikidata="Q2466049" url="?curid=432041" title="Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara">
<text>Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara (1585October 1655) was an Irish soldier of the 17th century. After lengthy service as a mercenary in the Spanish Army, Preston returned to Ireland following the outbreak of the Rebellion of 1641. He was appointed to command the Leinster Army of the Irish Confederacy, enjoying some success as well as a number of heavy defeats such as the Battle of Dungans Hill in 1647 where his army was largely destroyed. Like other Confederate leaders, Preston was a Catholic Royalist. He remained in close contact with the Lord Lieutenant the Marquess of Ormonde, and was a strong supporter of an alliance between Confederates and Royalists against the English Republicans.

Following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, he left for France where he joined the Royalist Court-in-exile and was made Viscount Tara by Charles II.

==Lineage==
Preston was a descendant of Robert Preston, 1st Baron Gormanston, who in 1363 purchased the lands of Gormanston, County Meath, and who was Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1388. The Prestons came originally from the Lancashire town of that name, and arrived in Ireland some time before 1320.

Sir Robert&#x27;s great-grandson, Robert Preston, was created Viscount Gormanston in 1478; and the latter&#x27;s great-grandson was Christopher, 4th Viscount Gormanstown (died 1599), whose second son was Thomas Preston. Thomas&#x27;s mother was Catherine FitzWilliam, daughter of the wealthy Dublin landowner Sir Richard FitzWilliam of Baggotrath Castle. He was thus a close relative of Viscount FitzWilliam.

==Continental service==
Thomas&#x27;s elder brother succeeded in the title of Viscount Gormanstown, so Thomas Preston pursued a career in the military. Since Roman Catholics were not allowed to hold state positions in Ireland, he entered the Spanish service and fought in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Preston was in the same Irish regiment in the Spanish service as Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill, and distinguished himself in the defence of Leuven against the French and Dutch in 1635. Between him and Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill, there was from the first intense jealousy. There was also some tension between Preston and James Tuchet. In 1644 Tuchet, the Earl of Castlehaven was chosen to lead a major Confederate expedition into Ulster. Unlike Preston, Castlehaven was a military amateur but was he favoured over Preston as he was of a prominent English family.

==Irish Confederacy==
Preston returned to Ireland after the Irish Rebellion of 1641 to support his fellow Irish Catholics. He was appointed general of Leinster, by the Irish Confederates, which was the largest and best equipped of the Irish Catholic forces.

His performance as a commander in Ireland in the intermittent wars of 1642 to 1652 was mixed. He won widespread praise for his successful siege of Duncannon in 1645, but lost a string of field battles including New Ross (1643) and Dungans Hill (1647). This last battle was disastrous for the Confederates, as their Leinster army was all but wiped out at it. In general, he was skilled in the art of siegecraft, but never had a very good understanding of mobile warfare.

In August 1646, Preston&#x27;s alcoholism and royalist tendencies led Chief Doctor Owen O&#x27;Shiel to leave Preston&#x27;s command and move to the Ulster Army.

Preston played a major part in the Confederates&#x27; internal strife, siding at first with radicals who opposed the first Ormonde peace, but later siding with the moderates who signed a conclusive treaty with Ormonde and the Royalists in 1648. His Royalism was motivated by his Old English roots and his extreme personal dislike of Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill, who led the opposing faction. He fought with the defeated Royalists during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, defending the city of Waterford until hunger and disease forced him to capitulate. He marched his remaining troops to Galway, the last Irish-held city on the island. In late 1652, after another lengthy siege, Galway too was reduced by plague and lack of supplies. Preston surrendered the city on condition that he and his troops be allowed to leave the country and find employment in the French army. 
He left the country for exile in France, where the Royalist court was in exile, in 1652.

In 1650 Charles II while in exile created him Viscount Tara; and after his departure from Ireland in 1652 he offered his services to Charles in Paris, where he died in October 1655.

==Family==
Preston&#x27;s wife was a Flemish lady of rank, Claire van der Eycken, daughter of Philippe-Charles van der Eycken and Anne de Jauche de Mastaing. She was the sister of Anthone van der Eycken (+ 22 march 1646) lord of Sint-Joris (Beernem in Flanders). Preston had by Claire three children. Louise (born 1624), a daughter by his second wife Catharina Reyns, was the second wife of Sir Phelim O&#x27;Neill, while her sister Mary married Colonel Francis Netterville, a grandson of Nicholas Netterville, 1st Viscount Netterville, and after his death married Colonel John Fitzpatrick. His son Anthony succeeded him as 2nd Viscount Tara, a title that became extinct on the murder by Sir Francis Blundell, 3rd Baronet and his brothers of Thomas, 3rd Viscount, in 1674.
Charles II, who during his exile lodged with the Preston family in Bruges, spoke warmly of the children and their guardian Miss Warren in his later years, but did nothing to repair their ruined fortunes: the younger Thomas in 1670 was said to be penniless.

<doc id="432042" wikidata="Q680674" url="?curid=432042" title="Botho zu Eulenburg">
<text>Botho Wendt August [[Graf]] zu Eulenburg (31 July 1831 – 5 February 1912) was a Prussian statesman. Throughout the entire German Empire period he was, alongside Albrecht von Roon the only Minister President of Prussia not also to be Chancellor of Germany, with the two offices being practically synonymous. 

==Early life and career==
Eulenburg was born in Wicken (now in Pravdinsky District) to Botho Heinrich zu Eulenburg (1804–1879) and Therese née von Dönhoff (1806–1882). He studied law at the universities of Königsberg and Bonn.

Eulenburg worked in high positions of the Prussian and German administration in Wiesbaden (1869–1872), Metz (president of the Département de la Lorraine; 1872–1873) and upper president of the Province of Hanover (1873–1878). 
In March 1878 Eulenburg succeeded his first cousin once removed Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg as Minister of the Interior, serving under Bismarck. He implemented a series of repressive anti-socialist measures. From 1881 to 1892 he was the president of the province of Hesse-Nassau. 

==Prime Minister of Prussia==

In 1892, he was appointed Prime Minister of Prussia in succession to Leo von Caprivi, who however remained Chancellor of Germany. 

Though Caprivi had recommended the experienced administrator Eulenburg for this appointment, the new prime minister soon made life difficult for Caprivi, and often thought of pressing for his removal. Both Caprivi and Eulenburg were eventually dismissed by Wilhelm II following the renewal of anti-Socialist moves (and an anti-subversion bill) in 1894. Eulenburg often thought of himself as the only possible successor to Caprivi, and he was extremely unhappy to be dismissed at what he regarded as the moment of his destiny. 

From 1899 until his death, Eulenburg was a member of the Prussian House of Lords. He died in Berlin in 1912 and is buried in No. I cemetery of Trinity Church, Berlin-Kreuzberg.

==Personal life and family==
Eulenburg was the older brother of August zu Eulenburg, Marshal of the Prussian royal court, and a second cousin of Prince Philip of Eulenburg, a close friend of Wilhelm II, German Emperor, and an instrumental figure behind the scenes of German politics.

On 25 October 1875 he married at Neustadt, West Prussia Elisabeth von Alvensleben (22 September 1834 in Brandenburg/Havel – 5 September 1919 in Neustadt), by whom he had an only son, Botho (15 February 1879 in Berlin – 30 May 1881 in Berlin).

== Honours ==
He received the following orders and decorations:

<text>Albrecht Theodor Emil Graf von Roon (; 30 April 1803 – 23 February 1879) was a Prussian soldier and statesman. As Minister of War from 1859 to 1873, Roon, along with Otto von Bismarck and Helmuth von Moltke, was a dominating figure in Prussia&#x27;s government during the key decade of the 1860s, when a series of successful wars against Denmark, Austria, and France led to German unification under Prussia&#x27;s leadership. A moderate conservative and supporter of executive monarchy, he was an avid modernizer who worked to improve the efficiency of the army.

== Education ==
Roon was born at Pleushagen (now Pleśna), near Kolberg (now Kołobrzeg, Poland). His family was of Flemish origin and had settled in Pomerania. His father, an officer of the Prussian Army, died in poverty during the French occupation of the Kingdom of Prussia (see Napoleonic Wars), and the young Roon was brought up by his maternal grandmother.

Roon entered the corps of cadets at Kulm (now Chełmno, Poland) in 1816, from where he proceeded to the military school at Berlin in 1818, and in January 1821, he received a commission in the 14th (3rd Pomeranian) regiment quartered at Stargard in Pomerania. In 1824, he went through the three-year higher course of study at the General War School in Berlin (later called the Prussian Military Academy), where he improved his general education. Two years later, he was transferred to the 15th regiment at Minden.

== Publications ==
In 1826, he was appointed an instructor in the military cadet school at Berlin, where he devoted himself especially to the subject of military geography. He was a student of the noted geographer Carl Ritter who taught at the Berlin military school. In 1832, Roon published the well-known &quot;Principles of Physical, National and Political Geography&quot;, in three volumes (&quot;Grundlage der Erd-, Völker- und Staaten-Kunde&quot;), which gained him a great reputation, and of which over 40,000 copies were sold in a few years. This work was followed in 1834 by &quot;Elements of Geography&quot; (&quot;Anfangsgrunde der Erdkunde&quot;), in 1837 by &quot;Military Geography of Europe&quot; (&quot;Militärische Landerbeschreibung von Europa&quot;), and in 1839 by &quot;The Iberian Peninsula&quot; (&quot;Die Iberische Halbinsel&quot;).
== Early military career ==
In 1832, Roon rejoined his regiment and was afterwards attached to the headquarters of General von Müffling&#x27;s corps of observation at Krefeld, where he first became aware of the very inefficient state of the Prussian Army. In 1833, he was appointed to the Topographical Bureau at Berlin. In 1835, he entered the Prussian General Staff, and, in 1835, he was promoted captain and became instructor and examiner in the military academy at Berlin. In 1842, after an illness of two years brought on by overwork, he was promoted to major and attached to the staff of the VII Corps, where he was again impressed with the inefficiency of the organization of the army, and he occupied himself with schemes for its reform.

In 1844, as tutor to Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, he attended the prince at Bonn University and in his European travels. In 1848, he was appointed chief of the staff of the VIII Corps at Koblenz. During the disturbances of that year, he served under Prince William, later king and emperor, in the suppression of the insurrection at Baden and distinguished himself by his energy and bravery, receiving the 3rd class of the order of the Red Eagle in recognition of his services. While attached to the prince&#x27;s staff at that time, Roon broached to the prince his schemes of army reform. In 1850, after the revelation of defective organization and efficiency that led to the humiliating Treaty of Olmütz, Roon was made a lieutenant-colonel and, in 1851, full colonel.

== Army reform ==
Promoted to major-general in 1856 and to lieutenant-general in 1859, Roon had held several commands since 1850, having been employed on important missions. Prince Wilhelm became regent in 1858 and, in 1859, appointed Roon a member of a commission to report on the reorganization of the army. During the Austro-Sardinian War, Roon was charged with the mobilization of a division. At the end of 1859, although he was only a junior lieutenant-general in the army, he succeeded Eduard von Bonin as war minister. In 1861, the ministry of marine was also entrusted to him.

Supported by Edwin von Manteuffel and the new Prussian Chief of Staff, Helmuth von Moltke, Roon drew up plans to adapt Gerhard von Scharnhorst&#x27;s system to Prussia&#x27;s altered circumstances. Roon proposed an increase in universal military service to three years, with new regiments raised and a reduced role for the reserve (&quot;Landwehr&quot;), whose role in the War of Liberation (1813) was still celebrated in nationalist myth.

Roon, by contrast, believed that the &quot;Landwehr&quot; was both a politically and militarily false institution, limited in utility and lacking martial qualities. Roon&#x27;s proposals for army reorganization met with strong opposition from the Prussian Landtag, which was dominated by the liberal German Progress Party, which wanted parliamentary control over the military budget. It took years of political fighting and the strong support of the new prime minister, Otto von Bismarck and Moltke, before Roon carried the day.

Roon also lengthened the compulsory military service to three years (four years for artillery and cavalry), and expanded the army to 200,000 men. These reforms were unpopular with the Prussian people and made Roon one of the most hated men in Prussia. However the reforms were supported by the King William I, and the chancellor Otto von Bismarck.

== National hero ==

After the successful outcome of the Second Schleswig War of 1864, Roon went from being widely disliked in Prussia to a national hero in still-disunited Germany.

At the start of the Austro-Prussian War, Roon was promoted to &quot;General der Infanterie&quot;. He was present at the decisive victory at Königgrätz, under the command of Moltke. He received the Black Eagle at Nikolsburg on the road to Vienna. His army system was adopted after 1866 by the whole North German Confederation. In later years, his army system was copied throughout continental Europe.

During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871, Roon was in attendance on Prussian King Wilhelm I. The war was a great victory for Prussia and Roon&#x27;s contribution to success was considerable. He was created a &quot;Graf&quot; (count) on 19 January 1871, just after Moltke. In January 1873, he succeeded Bismarck (who continued to be Imperial Chancellor) as Minister President of Prussia. Ill-health compelled him to resign later that year, handing the job back to Bismarck. Roon was promoted to field marshal on 1 January 1873. However he resigned from the army soon due to ill health.

Roon died in Berlin on 23 February 1879. He was interred in the Roon family crypt at Schloss Krobnitz, west of Görlitz.

==Memorials==
The armored cruiser SMS &quot;Roon&quot;, completed in 1906, was named for Albrecht von Roon. A memorial statue can be found with those for Bismarck and Moltke at the Victory Column in Berlin.

==Honours and awards==
He received the following orders and decorations:
==Bibliography==
His son published &quot;Denkwürdigkeiten aus dem Leben des Generalfeldmarschalls Kriegsministers Grafen Roon&quot; (Memorable experiences from the life of General Field Marshal and Minister of War Count Roon) (2 vols., Breslau, 1892), and &quot;Kriegsminister von Roon als Redner politisch und militärisch erläutert&quot; (Minister of War Roon&#x27;s Political and Military Speeches Examined) (Breslau, 1895). His correspondence with his friend Professor Cl. Perthes, 1864–67, was also published at Breslau in 1895.

<text>Blagoevgrad ( ) is а town in Southwestern Bulgaria, the administrative centre of Blagoevgrad Municipality and of Blagoevgrad Province. With a population of almost inhabitants, it is the economic and cultural centre of Southwestern Bulgaria. It is located in the valley of the Struma River at the foot of the Rila Mountains, south of Sofia, close to the border with North Macedonia.

Blagoevgrad features a pedestrian downtown, with preserved 19th-century architecture and numerous restaurants, cafés, coffee shops, and boutiques. It is home to two universities, the South-West University &quot;Neofit Rilski&quot; and the American University in Bulgaria. The town also hosts the &quot;Sts. Cyril and Methodius National Humanitarian High School&quot;. The former Bulgarian Men&#x27;s High School of Thessaloniki moved from Thessaloniki to Blagoevgrad (then Gorna Dzhumaya) in 1913.

==Name==
In Ottoman times the town was known as &quot;Yukarı Cuma&quot; in Turkish or &quot;Gorna Dzhumaya&quot; in Bulgarian (a partial translation of the Ottoman name). The name &quot;Gorna Dzhumaya&quot; (Горна Джума; &quot;Upper Dzhumaya&quot;) distinguished the town from &quot;Dolna Dzhumaya&quot; (Долна Джумая; &quot;Lower Dzhumaya&quot;, &quot;Cuma-i Zir&quot; in Turkish) to the south. The second is called today Irakleia, and is in Greece. The Aromanian language still uses this name to refer to the city, as it is known in the language as . In comparison, Irakleia (&quot;Lower Dzhumaya&quot;) is known as .

The town was renamed &quot;Blagoevgrad&quot; in 1950, after the Bulgarian Workers&#x27; Social Democratic Party founder Dimitar Blagoev, who was an immigrant from Ottoman Macedonia.

==History==
=== Antiquity ===
A Hellenistic settlement called Scaptopara (&quot;market town&quot; in Thracian, &quot;Σκαπτοπάρα&quot; in Greek) emerged on the site of ancient Thracian settlement around 300 BC and was later incorporated into the Roman Empire with the rest of Thrace in 48 AD. The settlement was known for its hot springs supplying &quot;thermae&quot;. During the Crisis of the Third Century, the Scaptoparans wrote a petition to the emperor Gordian III, whose Latin and Koine Greek text is preserved in an inscription discovered there in 1868, and dated 238 AD. The petition complained about the conduct of soldiers and visitors to the baths and that appeals to the governor of the province of Thrace had failed; the emperor&#x27;s reply, also inscribed, disclaimed responsibility and again referred the citizens to the governor for redress. The inscription has since been lost. Subsequently, the area was part of the eastern half of the late antique Roman Empire which later became known as the Byzantine Empire.

=== Ottoman Empire ===
Although the history of the settlement in the Middle Ages is unknown, during the Ottoman rule of the Balkans it became a Muslim-majority town called &quot;Cuma-ı Bala&quot;, meaning &quot;Upper Juma&quot; in Persian and Ottoman Turkish.

In the middle of the 17th century, the Ottoman traveller Evliya Çelebi passed by here and wrote that the town of Orta Jumaa had 200 tiled houses, a large mosque with many worshippers and 80 souks and many mineral springs.

A Bulgarian quarter called &quot;Varosha&quot; was formed during the Bulgarian National Revival, with many of its typical houses and the Church of the Presentation of the Mother of God from 1844 being preserved to this day. In the 1830s, the French geologist Ami Boué passed by here and described Dzhumaya as a town of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, where a hereditary voivode lived. The mosques prove that there were many Turks and Pomaks along with the Bulgarians. The streets are paved and very irregular. According to him, the Bulgarians call the town Shuma (from &quot;shuma&quot; - forest). Victor Grigorovich visited the town in 1845. A &quot;chitalishte&quot; was founded in 1866. Bulgarian scholar Georgi Strezov visited the town in 1891. According to him, there were 1200 houses.

=== First half of 20th century ===
In 1900, according to Vasil Kanchov the population of the town numbered 6440 people, of whom 1250 were Bulgarians, 4500 Turks, 250 Vlachs, 200 Roma, 180 Jews and 60 Greeks. During that time most of the Turks lived in the town and the Bulgarians lived in the surrounding villages. Many refugees from Greek and Vardar Macedonia arrived in the town in the subsequent decades.

The Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 saw the annexation of the area Ottoman rule and its integration in the Bulgarian state in the Treaty of Constantinople. Before the Balkan Wars, Cuma-ı Bala was bounded as &quot;kaza&quot; to Serez &quot;sandjak&quot; in Selanik &quot;vilayet&quot;.

On October 5, 1912, Gorna Dzhumaya was seized by the Bulgarian army. After the Second Balkan War War in 1913, the Turkish population was largely displaced, and large masses of Bulgarian refugees from Aegean and Vardar Macedonia settled in the town. According to Dimitar Gadzhanov, in 1916 Gorna Dzhumaya numbered about 7,000 people, of whom only 30 were Turkish families, 100 families of wealthy Aromanians and a few Jews and Gypsies.

In March 1943, during World War II, the Bulgarian Commissariat for Jewish Affairs (KEV) established at Gorna Dzhumaya (modern Blagoevgrad) a transit camp for Jews deported from Bulgaria during the Holocaust. The Jews had been arrested in the new &quot;Belomora Oblast&quot; in Bulgarian-occupied Greece and Bulgarian-annexed Pirot in Yugoslavia. The camp consisted of a tobacco warehouse and some school buildings, under the command of KEV official Ivan Tepavski, where inmates were imprisoned and malnourished for 11–12 days before being taken to Lom, embarked for Vienna, and finally exterminated at Treblinka.

== Geography ==
Blagoevgrad is situated in the valley of the Struma and the smaller Blagoevgradska Bistritsa flows through it. It is nestled at 360 m above sea level in the Blagoevgrad valley between the Rila and Vlahina mountains and is in close proximity to Pirin Mountain. Blagoevgrad is 102 km from the capital Sofia, 237 km from Plovdiv, 545 km from Varna and 476 km from Burgas.

Blagoevgrad has a hot-summer continental climate with influences of a mediterranean climate due to warm air masses coming from the Sandanski-Petrich valley. The town is protected from cold northerly winds due to the natural barrier of the Rila and Pirin mountains. Mountain breeze descends from Rila along the river Blagoevgradska Bistritsa bringing cool air during hot summer days. Wind is moderate - 1.6 metres per second. Thanks to the many mountain forests around the town and the lack of industrial pollution, the air is clean in Blagoevgrad. Winter is mild, brief and marked by little to no snowfall. The average temperature in January is . Summers are long and dry, with a small amount of rainfall. The average July and August temperature is and the maximum temperature measured in Blagoevgrad is , while the record low temperature measured is The average annual temperature is around .

The Eastern Orthodox population of the town in the 19th-20th centuries was traditionally part of the Diocese of Nevrokop (since 1894 part of the Bulgarian Exarchate). After the division of the diocese between Bulgaria and Greece in 1913, from 1921 to 1928 Gorna Dzhumaya was its centre. From 1928 to 1941 and from 1945 to 1951, the seat of the diocese was temporarily in Nevrokop, and in 1951 it was finally moved to Blagoevgrad. The head of the diocese from 1994 to 2013 was Metropolitan Nathanael.

===Sports===
Generally, sports are well developed, but the town&#x27;s traditionally strong sports, handball and basketball, have been in financial crisis and without representation in the national leagues in years past (only supporting children and youth ensembles).

The crisis in basketball and handball provides others with the opportunity to pick up pace. Taekwon-Do, in the form of &quot;Falcon&quot; club has given Blagoevgrad and Bulgaria multiple European and World Championship medals, including a European Championship in 2004 (Todor Kozladerov). Baseball is a little-known sport in Bulgaria but it thrives in Blagoevgrad.

<text>The Ducal Palace of the Braganza or Palace of the Dukes of Braganza () is a medieval estate and former residence of the first Dukes of Braganza, located in the historical centre of Guimarães (Oliveira do Castelo), in the north-western part of Portugal.

It was initiated between 1420 and 1422 by Afonso, Count of Barcelos, the illegitimate son of John I of Portugal (and future Duke of Bragança), after his marriage to his second wife. His descendants would occupy the space until the Dukes of Braganza moved to Vila Viçosa, abandoning the palace. The 16th Century marked the beginning of period of ruin, which was aggravated during the 19th century, when the local population used the palace as a personal quarry. During the Estado Novo regime, a controversial restoration restored the Palace, while implying a grandeur that may not have existed. The &quot;Palace of the Dukes&quot; was classified as a National Monument () in 1910, and has been an official residence for the Presidency.

==History==
The residence was ordered to be built in the first quarter of the 15th century (likely 1420 to 1422) by Afonso, Count of Barcelos, the illegitimate son of John, and future Duke of Braganza, following his return to Portugal after a series of diplomatic missions to the Courts of France, Venice, Aragon and Castile. The construction of this building marked the concretization of his second marriage, when he took residence in the town. The project was given, as some authors have suggested, to French architect Antom. Yet, by 1442, it was still under construction when the Regent Peter came to Guimarães and stayed at the Palace, at the time conferring on his half-brother the title of 1st Duke of Braganza. The commission continued into 1461, when Afonso died: the property and titles passed on to his brother, Fernando, although the widow, Constança de Noronha, continued to live at the residence and received the land rents from the holdings in Guimarães.

In 1464, the title of Count of Guimarães is given to Fernando II, son of the Duke of Braganza, by King Afonso V (which was later renovated in 1475). Three years later, on 1 April 1478, the 2nd Duke of Branganza, died, followed two years later by the death of the widow of the 1st Duke of Braganza: the titles and vast land holdings passed on to Fernando II. During the 16th century there was a move towards monumental construction, increasing at the time the main floor over the principal gate. This was a period when the second Duke of Braganza, Fernando who pushed for a symmetrical design and layout. The functional organization of the spaces, dates from these renovations and included: the first floor, its servants&#x27; quarters and support rooms, and the second floor, that was devoted to the residence of the nobles, structured around the chapel and divided into individual spaces for the Duke and Duchess. But, Fernando&#x27;s move to Vila Viçosa during the 16th century, meant that the residence was closed for long periods. Most records on the buildings construction include the fact that the Palace was incomplete at the time that it was abandoned: Father Torcato Peixoto de Azevedo indicated that the residence had never really been completed in his Memórias (1692); which was also complemented by Father António de Carvalho da Costa (1706), who mentioned the same in his work Corografia Portuguesa; and Father Manuel da Mialhada also referred to the incomplete &quot;Palace of the Dukes&quot;. Transcribed in 1900 by Albano Bellino, a 29 December 1761 document indicated the plan and elevation of the Palace, without referencing the central courtyard.

King John II at the time was very interested in curbing the seigneurial power of the nobility and concentrating his power. Fernando (supported by the King&#x27;s cousin, the Infante Diogo, Duke of Viseu) protested and conspired with Isabella I of Castile, which resulted in his being accused of treason by King John II, when the Duke&#x27;s correspondence was intercepted by the King&#x27;s spies. By order of the King, the Duke&#x27;s properties and possessions were confiscated, and his residence in Guimarães continued to be looked after as Crown property, even as Duke Fernando was judged and executed on 20 June 1483 in Évora. The house was cared for by carpenters João Domingos, and later his son-in-law Afonso Anes, who were appointed to head the renovations of the property by John II.

In 1496, the properties of the House of Braganza were restored to Fernando II&#x27;s oldest son Jaime, three years after returning from exile in Spain. Yet, Jaime chose to remain in Vila Viçosa after the family restoration, and as a result, the residence in Guimarães were closed.

The Dukedom of Guimarães was given as dowry to Isabel, sister of the 5th Duke Teodósio I, in her marriage to her cousin the Infante Edward (on 21 August 1536), thus-by passing the palace onto a peripheral branch of hereditary successors to the House of Aviz.

A century later, the space began a slow decline, which began innocently enough. On 20 October 1611, the Poor Clares nuns requested rock and stone from around the palace in order to repair their monastery. A similar request was made in 1666 by the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin to King Afonso VI (10th Duke of Braganza), to utilize rock from the interior walls of the palace to construct the Convent of Piedade. On January 31, the municipal chamber intervened over the destruction occurring to the Palace, and on 4 February inspected and evaluated its condition in order to inform the King of the need to conserve its structure. The local government purposed funding the friars, and providing the stone from the barbican in the Castle of Guimarães, in exchange for stone in the Palace. As conditions continued to deteriorate the municipal chamber requested the roaming magistrate determine who stole stone from near the gate of Santa Cruz. On 26 November 1672, Pedro Vaz de Sampaio, master mason, was requested to replace the gate, since it was already ruined. There was a profound degradation in the following centuries, with more and more of its stone taken for construction in the city and its re-purposing as a barracks in 1807. At that time, the inhabitable part of the Palace was retiled by the &quot;almoxarife&quot; Jerónimo de Matos Feijó and served as the barracks for the 20th Regimental Infantry.

Several public works were completed on 8 January 1819. By 30 December 1880, its importance as a historical building was made clear by the Portuguese &quot;Royal Association of Civil Architects and Archeologists&quot; (), as a second-order historical monument.

Father António José Ferreira Caldas, writing in 1881, referred to the site as being in a state of ruins, serving as a barracks for various regiments and battalions. He made detailed description of what existed, including the grande courtyard, its main façade with one floor, lateral and posterior façades slightly taller, chapel door, the columns that supported the courtyard&#x27;s gallery, its Flemish stained-glass windows in the chapel and diverse tiled chimneys. This was complimented in a similar report in 1886 by Vilhena Barbosa who also mentioned the columns in the northeastern lateral façade that supported the porch.

===Republic===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the medieval structure was irredeemably corrupted.

On 26 September 1933, the conservational director of the Alberto Sampaio Museum, Dr. Alfredo Guimarães, requested from António de Oliveira Salazar visit the ruined palace, which helped to motivate the reconstruction of the building. Architect Rogério de Azevedo was commissioned in 1936 to complete the restoration, forcing the abandonment of the space by the military. What would become a radical restoration was started in 1937, under the architect Rogério de Azevedo, which was both restorative and controversial.

In 1940, a statue of Afonso Henriques is transferred to the ramp/entranceway of the Palace, alongside &quot;Rua Conde D. Afonso Henriques&quot;, by the municipal authority.

The restoration was based on the analysis of other medieval palaces of the period, but influenced by the monumentalism of the period architects. As part of the ongoing restoration, the courtyard railing from the Monastery of São Miguel de Refojos is recycled for the palace in 1943. Also, as part of the project, in 1952 and again in 1955, the architects travelled to Brussels, Antwerp and to Loire region, to study the decorative solutions for the palace. Further, there was a confluence of other styles and motifs associated with the Estado Novo regime, including a politico-religious nationalism that saw Guimarães as the centre of the modern Portuguese nation. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Palace was later transformed into an official residence of the Presidente do Conselho and President of the Republic.

In 1957, the landscaping of the space is undertaken (which also included the Campo de São Mamede) by landscape architect António Viana Barreto. As the restoration of the building was coming to an end, in 1958, the chapel was renovated (by sculptor Manuel Ventura Teixeira and Pintor António Lino) and the furniture was collected and installed by the &quot;Comissão para Aquisição de Mobiliário&quot; (&quot;Commission for Furniture Acquisition&quot;) in 1959.

By 24 June 1959, the new Palace of the Dukes of Braganza was inaugurated and finally open to the public.

Today, part of the property has been reconverted into a Museum, whose collection and disposition are to educate the public on its history during the 16th and 17th century. In its vast collection, are the tapestries of Pastrana, which narrate some of the events in North African conquests, attributed to Nuno Gonçalves (author of the polyptych in the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora; a collection of porcelains from the Portuguese East India Company; a group of Portuguese dinner sets from important factories (such as Prado, Viana, Rocha Soares and Rato); and a collection of Flemish tapestries by Peter Paul Rubens, among others.

==Architecture==
The Palace is located in the urban setting of the historic centre of Guimarães on the top of Monte Latito, encircled by a forested park and green-space, intersected by several pedestrian trails. In its proximity to the southeast, the Chapel of Santa Cruz, to the north the Church of São Miguel do Castelo and the Castle of Guimarães. In a space to the left of the main ramp/entranceway is a monument erected to Afonso Henriques.

===Exterior===

Structured around a central rectangular courtyard, the lateral buildings housing the official residences, while a chapel is located opposite the entrance. Its simple/basic form is one of the best examples of Portuguese late-medieval construction used by the nobility, comparable to the 14th century French palaces/buildings of the time. It was also used as an example for the Palace of the Kings of Majorca, in Perpignan, of which it is a faithful model.

The plan developed around a rectangular building with four rectangular towers, around an interior courtyard dominated by the chapel on the southeast wing. The spaces are articulated and staggered horizontal floors, covered with different roof tiles, in addition to with six tall chimneys. Each façades is made of granite, masonry block and interspersed by rectangular windows of varying styles: cruciform, stained-glass, standard and oblique. A few of the first floor windows are covered in metal grating. The northwest façade has an arch doorway surmounted by corbels and is recessed from the two towers. The superior floor is a balcony that runs the length of the interior courtyard, supported by corbels, which unite the guard towers. The lateral (northeast and southwest) façades are of a lower height and covered by trim and corbels, that supports the covered balcony, interspersed by openings at floor level. The southwest wing is broken by the body of the chapel, which extends away from the façade (identifiable by two large Flemish stained-glass windows), and is highlighted by a cantilever roof within the courtyard.

The towers are all closed rectangular bodies, with watchtowers, interspersed by small windows.

The interior patio, accessible from the main doorway, is a balcony that overlooks the courtyard: supported by Gothic arches on the main floor and columns on the second. At the roof-line, on all interior façades are balconies supported by granite corbels, while the chapel-side façade is highlighted by two isolated balconies (covered by tiled awnings) supported by similar corbels. The same façade is highlighted by a cantilever roof, supported by a rounded wooden arch and two supports decorated with columns. In the interior of this awning is a portal (consisting of four inset arches) preceded by a staircase, which gives access to the chapel. The gallery is covered by masonry stone on the main floor, and tiles on the second, with interior covering in wood.

===Interior===
The austere interior spaces include simple granite walls with ceilings and floors in wood.
Spaces on the first floor are divided into several rooms, separated by narrow corridors that run perpendicular to the façades. In these spaces are the visitors reception area, storage, carpenters space, main hall and office of the director of the site. In the main wing is the unique staircase in the palace, consisting of four flights in granite.

The intermediary floor, corresponds to the museum space, consisting of the towers and halls with rock fireplaces, including the &quot;Salão de Banquetes&quot; (&quot;Banquet Hall&quot;) and the &quot;Salão dos Passos Perdidos&quot; (&quot;Hall of Lost Steps&quot;), with roofs designed like the interior wooden keel of a boat.

The last floor, was dedicated for the use of the President of the Republic, and is characterized by a succession of bedrooms with private bathrooms, between two suites located within the towers (for the President and Prime Minister. This floor is immediately accessible via the small elevator on the ground floor and staircase from the second floor cloister.

The last floor of the posterior wing is marked by a succession of rooms and the chapel. The chapel has a single nave, which is covered by a wooden ceiling presenting visible joists. A straight narrow wooden choir, allows access to balconies which extend to the front of the church and the exterior facade, as well as the corridors of the remaining wards. The richly carved wood benches in the nave precede the elevated presbytery, which is delimited by a wooden guardrail.

<doc id="432065" wikidata="Q1932590" url="?curid=432065" title="Substance 1987">
<text>Substance (also known as Substance 1987) is a compilation album by English alternative dance band New Order. It was released in August 1987 by Factory Records. The album compiles all of the band&#x27;s singles at that point in their 12-inch versions, along with their respective B-side tracks. The then-newly released non-album single &quot;True Faith&quot; is also featured, along with its B-side &quot;1963&quot; and new versions of &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Confusion&quot;.

&quot;Substance&quot; was released as a double LP (12 tracks), a double CD (24 tracks), a double cassette (24 or 28 tracks), a single cassette (12 tracks) in the U.S. and a digital audio tape (24 tracks). It sold over one million copies and became New Order&#x27;s most popular and critically acclaimed album.

It is the companion to a similar singles compilation by New Order&#x27;s predecessor band Joy Division, also entitled &quot;Substance&quot;.

Peter Hook claimed on the &quot;Temptation&quot; podcast that the album was created because Tony Wilson bought a new Jaguar with a CD player built in and wanted all of New Order&#x27;s hits on one CD.

==Songs==
While &quot;Substance&quot; presents a sizeable collection of singles, there are many omissions and differences to be found from the original single releases:
* &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Confusion&quot; were re-recorded in 1987 specifically for &quot;Substance&quot; and neither of the original versions appears.
* &quot;Ceremony&quot; is the version recorded after Gillian Gilbert joined the band. The original trio version – the first New Order recording following the dissolution of Joy Division – was initially released as a 7&quot; single and reissued as a 12&quot; two months later. The 7&quot; version would not be re-released until the &quot;Singles&quot; collection in 2005 and the re-release of &quot;Movement&quot; in 2008.
* &quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot; (CD and DAT versions only), &quot;Sub-culture&quot;, &quot;Shellshock&quot; and &quot;Hurt&quot; are all edited down from their original 12&quot; recordings, the result of storage limitations of the CD, LP, and cassette formats. These edits are present on all copies of the album, despite the increased storage capacity provided by newer manufacturing methods (in particular, CDs in 1987 were only able to store up to 74 minutes of audio prior to unofficial revisions the following year).
* &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; and &quot;Mesh&quot; are incorrectly labelled as one another, as was the case on the original sleeve for &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot;; to add to the confusion, the iTunes Store release, based on the CD version, labels &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; as &quot;Mesh (Cries and Whispers)&quot;. This error was corrected for the digital release of the album on streaming services.
* &quot;Sub-culture&quot; is labelled as &quot;Subculture&quot;, and &quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot; is labelled as &quot;Perfect Kiss&quot;.
The standard tape version, due to the extra space befitting the format, also contains extra tracks in the form of &quot;Dub-vulture&quot;, &quot;Shellcock&quot;, and &quot;Bizarre Dub Triangle&quot;, as well as the actual &quot;Mesh&quot; (mislabeled &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;, again identically to the &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot; sleeve). Only on the limited edition cassette version does &quot;True Dub&quot; appear, as the last track on the second tape. This second tape, with a total play time of over 100 minutes, was exceptionally long for a commercial audio tape release at the time, which were generally no more than 80 minutes due to the increasing fragility of very thin magnetic tape. On all cassette versions, &quot;Murder&quot; is after &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; on the first cassette, whereas on the CD/DAT versions it appears on the second half of the album.

== Release and reception ==

&quot;Substance&quot; was released in August 1987 by Factory Records. According to Sputnikmusic, it showcased New Order&#x27;s mix of post-punk and dance styles with 12-inch singles remixed for club play and became the band&#x27;s &quot;most popular, well known, highly rated [record] and arguably their most influential&quot;. In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau said that the album&#x27;s vinyl edition showcases New Order&#x27;s discipline and chemistry as a band whose musical style is improved upon by the 12-inch mixes: &quot;Pure rhythm machine with an ironically mysterious overlay of schlocky melody to help it go down, this album is a case study in sensationalist art, and I say the world is better for it.&quot; Additionally, he called &quot;Substance&quot; &quot;sublime&quot; and &quot;a revelation&quot; in his column for &quot;Playboy&quot;. Christgau named it the seventh best album of 1987 in his list for the annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll.

In 2003, &quot;Substance&quot; was ranked number 361 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. According to the magazine, it had sold over one million copies by that time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at 363 in the list&#x27;s 2012 edition. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the album revealed the band&#x27;s strength as songwriters with a few of the best pop songs from the 1980s represented by &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot;, &quot;Temptation&quot;, and &quot;True Faith&quot;. According to Erlewine, it has been argued that the 12-inch mixes on &quot;Substance&quot; &quot;represent New Order&#x27;s most groundbreaking and successful work, since they expanded the notion of what a rock &amp; roll band, particularly an indie rock band, could do.&quot; Joe Gross wrote in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) that the album is &quot;pure pleasure&quot; and serves as &quot;a guidebook to 1980s pop&quot;, along with Prince&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot; (1984) and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990). &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Sal Cinquemani was less enthusiastic and said that the album is &quot;undeniably a product of its time&quot;. In 2005, Will Hermes included &quot;Substance&quot; in his &quot;definitive guide&quot; to dance-rock for &quot;Spin&quot; magazine. In 2022, &quot;Classic Pop&quot;″s Barry Page ranked it the fifth greatest compilation album of all time.

In November 2023, New Order re-released &quot;Substance&quot; in &quot;digitally remastered&quot; versions. In addition to double vinyl, double cd and double cassette formats, an expanded four CD version was also released, where CD three has alternate versions and extra b-sides, and CD four features an unreleased concert from 1987, where the band played the entire album in sequence.

==Track listing==

===LP version===

===CD/DAT version===
* Along with the vinyl edition&#x27;s 12-inch singles compiled on disc one, the CD version included a second disc that collects the B-sides of those singles.

===Cassette version===

*Some releases only contain the first cassette, which compiles the single A-sides. These versions (including the USA Qwest Records release) do not include the song &quot;Murder&quot;.
* Some releases do contain the track &quot;Murder&quot; as Track 7 on the (red) tape (Fact 200c Side One / Side Two) but it is listed incorrectly on the inlay as Track 9 (between &quot;Lonesome Tonight&quot; and &quot;Thieves Like Us Instrumental&quot; on the B-sides tape, although it is not actually on the (blue) tape (Fact 200c Side Three / Side Four) . &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; is also written as &quot;Cries an Whispers&quot; on the inside of the inlay, but spelled correctly on the panel visible when the Cassette is closed. This version concludes with the track &quot;1963&quot;, not &quot;True Dub&quot;.
* &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; and &quot;Mesh&quot; are listed in the wrong order on the insert.

===2023 expanded reissue===
The first two CDs are the same as the 1987 CDs, but remastered, except that &quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot; is now the unabridged 12-inch version (whereas &quot;Sub-culture&quot; and &quot;Shellshock&quot; remain the abridged 12-inch versions). Accordingly, on music site Deezer &quot;Sub-culture&quot;, &quot;Shellshock&quot; and &quot;Hurt&quot; are labeled as &quot;Substance Edit&quot;; &quot;Sub-culture&quot; also labeled as &quot;John Robie Remix&quot;, &quot;Ceremony&quot; as &quot;Version 2&quot; and &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; as &quot;Shep Pettibone Remix&quot;. Below track titles also taken from Deezer.


==Video release==
Substance 1989 is the video version of &quot;Substance&quot; that first appeared in 1989 on VHS; it was released on LaserDisc in Japan in 1991.

The cover is similar to the LP, except &quot;1987&quot; is replaced by &quot;1989&quot; (though the on-screen title is &quot;Substance 1983–88&quot;) and different background colours are used; the Factory/Qwest release has a grey background, the Japanese VHS release, blue and the LaserDisc, turquoise. The video includes linking sequences which are animated to the accompaniment of instrumental sections from &quot;The Happy One&quot;, an otherwise unreleased track from the &quot;Technique&quot; sessions.

<text>The San Gabriel Mountains () are a mountain range located in northern Los Angeles County and western San Bernardino County, California, United States. The mountain range is part of the Transverse Ranges and lies between the Los Angeles Basin and the Mojave Desert, with Interstate 5 to the west and Interstate 15 to the east. The range lies in, and is surrounded by, the Angeles and San Bernardino National Forests, with the San Andreas Fault as its northern border.

The highest peak in the range is Mount San Antonio, commonly referred to as Mt. Baldy. Mount Wilson is another notable peak, known for the Mount Wilson Observatory and the antenna farm that houses many of the transmitters for local media. The observatory may be visited by the public. On October 10, 2014, President Barack Obama designated the area the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument. The Trust for Public Land has protected more than of land in the San Gabriel Mountains, its foothills, and the Angeles National Forest.

==Geography==
Much of the range features rolling peaks. The range lacks craggy features, but contains a large number of canyons and is generally very rugged and difficult to traverse. The San Gabriel Mountains are composed of a large fault block between the San Andreas Fault Zone to the north, and the San Gabriel Fault and the Sierra Madre and Cucamonga Fault Zones to the south. This tectonic block was uplifted during the Miocene and has since been dissected by numerous rivers and washes.

===Setting and elevation===
The highest elevation, Mount San Antonio (Mount Baldy) at , rises towards the eastern extremity of the range which extends from the Cajon Pass (Interstate 15) on the east, where the San Gabriel Mountain Range meets the San Bernardino Mountain Range, westward to meet the Santa Susana Mountains at Newhall Pass (Interstate 5).

South and east of Santa Clarita and north of San Fernando, the San Gabriel Mountains crest abruptly up to about . Pacoima and Big Tujunga Canyons cut through the range just east of San Fernando, carrying runoff into the San Fernando Valley. Little Tujunga Canyon Road bridges the range in this area, connecting the San Fernando Valley to the Santa Clara River valley in the north. Towering over Big Tujunga Canyon north of Big Tujunga Reservoir, and south of Acton, is Mount Gleason, which at , is the highest in this region of the San Gabriels. South of the gorge is the southern &quot;foothills&quot; of the mountains, which rise abruptly above the Los Angeles Basin and give rise to the Arroyo Seco, a tributary of the Los Angeles River.

Southeast of Big Tujunga Canyon, the southern front range of the San Gabriels gradually grows in elevation, culminating in notable peaks such as Mount Wilson at . On the north the range is abruptly dissected by the canyon of the West Fork San Gabriel River. Even further north the range slopes up into the towering main crest of the San Gabriels, a sweeping arc-shaped massif in length that includes most of the highest peaks in the range: Waterman Mountain, at ; Mount Islip, at , Mount Baden-Powell, at , Pine Mountain, at , and Mount San Antonio, the highest peak in the range at .

On the north slopes of the San Gabriel crest, the northern ranks of mountains drop down incrementally to the floor of the Mojave Desert in a much more gradual manner than the sheer southern flank. The Angeles Crest Highway, one of the main routes across the San Gabriels, runs through this area from west to east. Little Rock, Big Rock, and Sheep Creeks drain off the northern part of the mountains, forming large alluvial fans as they descend into the Mojave. To the east, the San Andreas Fault cuts across the range, forming a series of long, straight, and narrow depressions, including Swarthout Valley and Lone Pine Canyon. South of Mount San Antonio, San Antonio Creek drains the mountains, cutting the deep San Antonio Canyon.
East of San Antonio Canyon, the range gradually loses elevation, and the highest peaks in this section of the mountain range are in the south, rising dramatically above the cities of Claremont, Upland and Rancho Cucamonga. However, there are still several notable peaks in this region, including Telegraph Peak, at , Cucamonga Peak, at , and Ontario Peak, rising . Lytle Creek, flowing generally southeast, drains most of the extreme eastern San Gabriels. The range terminates at Cajon Pass, through which runs Interstate 15, and beyond which rise the even higher San Bernardino Mountains.

===Locale===
The Range is bounded on the north by the Antelope Valley and the Mojave Desert and to the south by the communities of Greater Los Angeles. The south side of the range is almost continuously urbanized and includes the Los Angeles city communities of Sylmar, Pacoima, and Sunland-Tujunga, as well as cities and unincorporated areas of San Fernando, La Crescenta, La Cañada Flintridge, Altadena, Pasadena, Sierra Madre, Arcadia, Monrovia, Bradbury, Duarte, Azusa, Glendora, San Dimas, La Verne, Claremont, Upland, Rancho Cucamonga, Fontana, and Rialto. The north side of the range is less densely populated and includes the city of Palmdale as well as the small unincorporated towns of Acton, Littlerock, Pearblossom, Valyermo, Llano, Piñon Hills, and Phelan. At the west end of the range lies the city of Santa Clarita. Within the mountains themselves are the small unincorporated communities of Mount Baldy, Wrightwood, Big Pines and Lytle Creek.

===Hydrology===
Melting snow and rain runoff on the south side of the San Gabriels&#x27; highest mountains give rise to its largest river, the San Gabriel River. Just to the west of Mount Hawkins, a north-south divide separates water running down the two main forks of the river and their tributaries. The West Fork, beginning at Red Box Saddle, runs eastward, and the East Fork, starting north of Mount San Antonio, flows south and west through a steep, rugged and precipitous gorge. The two meet at San Gabriel Reservoir, and turn south, boring through the southern portion of the San Gabriels, emptying of the mountains near Azusa into the urban San Gabriel Valley, and eventually to the Pacific Ocean near Seal Beach.

==Climate==

The climate of the range varies with elevation from continental to the Mediterranean, with mostly dry summers (except for scattered summer thunderstorms) and cold, wet winters. Snow can fall above elevation during cold fronts between November and April, but is most common in December through March. Annual precipitation totals are mostly in excess of on the coastal (southern) slopes above elevation, with up to falling in some areas above .

The coastal (south) side of the range receives vastly more precipitation than the desert (northern) side. The highest precipitation is found in the central and eastern parts of the range (Mt. Wilson to Mt. San Antonio). Annual precipitation totals are highly variable from year to year, and can be extremely high during wet El Nino years (sometimes over , with single storm totals over ). Runoff from the mountains during big storms often produces flooding in adjacent foothill communities (especially in areas denuded by wildfires). The range is mostly smog-free above elevation, above the inversion layer. The large telescope installation at Mt. Wilson is a testimony to the clear atmospheric conditions that prevail, although light pollution from the L.A. basin below has hindered telescope activities in recent decades.

=== Wildfires ===
The San Gabriel Mountains see wildfires frequently. The fires are often driven by dry Santa Ana wind events in the summer and fall. Notable wildfires in the San Gabriel Mountains have included the 2009 Station Fire, 2020 Bobcat Fire, the 2024 Bridge Fire, and the 2025 Greater Los Angeles Wildfires.

==Geology==
Granitic and metasedimentary rocks are the primary constituent of the San Gabriel Mountains. Metasedimentary rocks were attached to the North American craton in the Precambrian eon, and granitic rocks formed throughout the Mesozoic as oceanic plates subducted underneath the North American west coast. Like nearly all of the other mountains in the Transverse Ranges, the San Gabriels are a series of fault blocks that were uplifted in the Cenozoic. Tectonic uplift rates and erosion rates systematically increase as topography steepens eastward in the San Gabriel Mountains, where the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults meet.

Current rates of erosion in the eastern San Gabriel mountains are among the fastest in the continental United States and have accelerated in response to the increased frequency of wildfires over the 1900s. Over future centuries, it remains unclear whether soil and brush ecosystems in the San Gabriel mountains will continue to re-establish soil and vegetation after increasing fire and soil-erosion frequencies, or if increasing fire frequencies and erosion will strip soils and permanently alter soil cover and vegetation types across the mountain ecosystem.

==Ecology==
There are both areas of conifer as well as broadleaf forestation, including the presence of some endemic taxa. Conifer (pine, fir, cedar) and oak forests are most widespread above where the precipitation is above (the central and eastern high San Gabriels). In the wetter areas, madrone and bay laurel trees also occur in places, and ferns are common. Trees like willow, alder, and cottonwood are also found throughout the range along with the stream courses (riparian habitat), even at lower elevations. Chaparral (dense shrub, brush, and small tree) vegetation is widespread where there is no continuous tall tree cover, especially at lower elevations. Chaparral is highly adapted to fire and replaces trees for decades after fires. With the recent increase in wildfire frequency and damage, chaparral occupies more and more of the San Gabriels each year. There is a subspecies of the Leather Oak which is found only within the San Gabriel Mountains. The Rift Zone along the San Andreas Fault produces numerous springs, sag ponds, and wetland areas that are critical habitats for a variety of native species. A prime example of such a sag pond is Jackson Lake just west of Wrightwood.

Larger animals include California mule deer, California black bear, San Pedro Martir coyote and the rarely seen mountain lion or cougar. Smaller mammals include raccoons, opossum, skunk, and bobcats. Golden and bald eagles are found rarely, but hawks are common. Rattlesnakes are common and often encountered on trails by hikers. Critically endangered yellow-legged frogs have declined or vanished from the streams due to the loss of suitable habitat. 

The San Gabriels mountains were once home to a thriving population of Southern Steelhead. The Arroyo Seco and San Gabriel River (California) had two major populations, but due to damming and channelization, these fish cannot make it upstream anymore. However, wild native rainbow trout still exist in streams and ponds throughout the mountains.

== Transportation ==

The main road that runs through the San Gabriel Mountains is the Angeles Crest Highway, State Route 2. It starts in the southwest at the city of La Cañada Flintridge and ends at its junction with State Route 138, just past Wrightwood, near the Victor Valley and the western Cajon Valley. Past its junction with Angeles Forest Highway, traveling east, Angeles Crest Highway features blind curves, various bumps, and potholes. This section of the &quot;Crest&quot; is closed during the winter due to rockfall and avalanche hazards. State Route 2, just past Mountain High, is called the Big Pines Highway to the Route 138 junction.

Another key county route through, the mountains is Angeles Forest Highway. Angeles Forest Highway begins 11 miles northeast of La Cañada Flintridge at its Angeles Crest Highway junction. Ending near Acton, it allows easy access to the central Forest and the fast-growing Antelope Valley. Because the &quot;Forest&quot; and the &quot;Crest&quot; portion leading to La Cañada Flintridge is well-traveled by Antelope Valley commuters, its road maintenance is much better, and it is open much of the winter.

State Route 39 connected the city of Azusa with the Angeles Crest Highway until it was seriously damaged by landslides, first in 1978, and again in 2005. The highway was opened to emergency crews in February 2003.

People heading to Mount Waterman must now travel west to Pasadena and then travel on the Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) in La Cañada Flintridge, a nearly two-hour trip. Reopening Highway 39 would cut the drive-time to the Waterman Ski Area in half and shorten the trip east to Wrightwood.

According to the Caltrans District Seven &quot;Inside Seven&quot; Newsletter, &quot;Two projects that will address those issues and get the highway reopened are scheduled for construction soon. The first, building two retaining walls near the city of Azusa from Old San Gabriel Canyon Road to approximately south of SR-2, could begin in mid-2009. The second, a $45 million project to reconstruct the roadway, construct soldier pile retaining walls, repair drainage systems, install rockfall protection, and provide asphalt concrete overlay and traffic striping, should begin in fall 2010.&quot;

In 2011, the planned repair of the road was abruptly terminated, due to concern of high future maintenance costs, and potential impact on the local bighorn sheep population. However, in October 2016, Caltrans announced it was again considering plans to re-open the road, after pressure from local communities.

==Recreation==
In the winter, snowboarding and skiing are quite popular in the San Gabriels, at Mountain High and Mt. Baldy. The two other resorts, Mount Waterman and Kratka Ridge, are rarely open due to insufficient snow. In the summer, canyoneering, hiking, backpacking, picnicking, and camping are some of the activities popular with visitors. From time to time, a hiker gets lost or stuck on a mountain ledge or may fall downhill. Some of the more extreme cases of emergency search-and-rescue efforts will often be given air time on Los Angeles television and radio newscasts. The Pacific Crest Trail passes along the mountain ridge.

During the winter, many Southern California mountaineers climb a variety of snow routes and even some ice routes in the San Gabriel Mountains. Baldy Bowl is by far the most popular route, getting hundreds of climbers per season. There are many other routes, offering a variety of choices.

Rock climbing is not as common in the San Gabriel Range as it is in neighboring areas, as this range is famous for loose rock. Various faults crisscross the range, making it one of the steepest and fastest-growing ranges in the world. Plate tectonic activity breaks up most rock, making it unsuitable for rock climbing. Williamson Rock was the most famous climbing area until it was closed for climbing. There are many other craggy areas scattered about the range that provide mostly traditional climbing opportunities.

Angeles National Forest Fire Lookout Association has rebuilt and operates Vetter Mountain Lookout, and Slide Mountain Lookout. The organization is rebuilding South Mount Hawkins Lookout.

<text>The Fresh Kills Landfill was a landfill covering in the borough of Staten Island in New York City, United States. The name comes from the landfill&#x27;s location along the banks of the Fresh Kills estuary in western Staten Island.

The landfill opened in 1948 as a temporary landfill, but by 1955 it had become the largest landfill in the world, and it remained so until its closure in 2001. At the peak of its operation, in 1986, Fresh Kills received of residential waste per day, playing a key part in the New York City waste management system. From 1991 until its closing it was the only landfill to accept New York City&#x27;s residential waste. It consists of four mounds that range in height from and hold about of solid waste. The archaeologist Martin Jones characterizes it as &quot;among the largest man-made structures in the history of the world.&quot;

In October 2008, reclamation of the site began for a multi-phase, 30-year site redevelopment. The landfill has been developed into Freshkills Park.

==Beginning==

New York&#x27;s municipal incinerators peaked in capacity with 21 plants in 1937 and declined during World War II when salvage and conservation programs reduced the use and discard of combustible materials. The result was the closing of nine of the city&#x27;s incinerators and a sharp reduction in the combustion of waste by 1944. By 1946, only ten incinerators were in operation, with capacity having declined by half since 1937. This meant more solid waste for the city&#x27;s eight landfills to handle. The two landfills in Brooklyn and the two in the Bronx had, respectively, just one and two years left before reaching capacity. Only one landfill, Edgemere Landfill in Queens, had a long-term future, and as such, an alternative site had to be found.

In 1946, New York City purchased a site, which was considered worthless swampland in what was then a rural agricultural area in Staten Island, for a proposed three-year municipal waste dump, as a temporary solution to the closing of the Rikers Island Landfill. The plan was endorsed by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority chairman, Robert Moses. He wanted the area to be developed as Staten Island&#x27;s industrial base, as it was opposite the Arthur Kill from the heavy industry of New Jersey. Moses saw the project as key to the development of the island, and with it, the possibility of more parkland, highways, industry, and possibly even an airport.

Staten Island residents and their representatives opposed the plan. Assemblyman Edmund P. Radigan introduced a secession bill in the Legislature. A bill was passed (later vetoed by the governor) requiring all garbage to be incinerated before dumping. Ellsworth B. Buck, called for the federal government to step in and stop the project. Cornelius Hall, when he was the city&#x27;s public works commissioner, opposed the project, but when he became the Borough President of Staten Island, he surprised residents by backing the plan, saying: &quot;I am firmly convinced that a limited landfill project can be undertaken at Fresh Kills, a project that would prove of great value to the island through the reclamation of valuable land from now worthless marshland. Hall intended the landfill to be part of a proposed belt highway along Staten Island&#x27;s west shore, which was approved by Moses in exchange for his support of the landfill. Hall went on to say &quot;I want [landfilling] operations limited to [a] period not to exceed three years ... I am going along with this proposal because I believe ... we are in a position to use this fill to our advantage, for the development of the West Shore of Staten Island, which is essential.&quot;. The talk of using Fresh Kills for only three years may have been a ploy to allow Hall to save face politically. As described in an inter-departmental report from 1946: &quot;Because of the substantial sums involved in the preparation and acquisition of the [Fresh Kills] site, [in order to justify this expense] the City must dispose of refuse at this location for a number of years.&quot;

One of the first steps taken was the dredging of the marsh to allow the passage of the city&#x27;s garbage scows. The landfill accepted its first scow in April 1948. Shortly before the landfill opened, an expansion of the landfill project was approved by the City Planning Commission, which called for a project organized in 13 sections. The landfill was planned to be structured in layers, with a layer of garbage covered by a layer of ash (the remains of burnable trash from the city&#x27;s incinerators), another layer of garbage, and then a layer of dirt to contain the smell. At the end of the landfill&#x27;s usable life, new real estate would be created, allowing it to top off at above sea level. The plan called for Fresh Kills to be used for 20 years, then developed as a multiuse area with residential, recreational, and industrial components. In 1950, the height was increased to . By 1955, Fresh Kills was the largest landfill in the world, serving as the principal landfill for household garbage collected in New York City.

==Operations==
Operations during the 1960s were conducted in three locations named &quot;Plant 1&quot;, &quot;Plant 2&quot;, and &quot;Brookfield Avenue.&quot; Plant #1 was located at the site of an old factory on the south side of the junction of the Great Fresh Kills, and Little Fresh Kills. It was reachable via Muldoon Avenue. Plant #2 was located a bit upstream on the north side of Fresh Kills near where Richmond Creek branches off. It was reachable from Victory Boulevard. The Brookfield Avenue site was north of the Arthur Kill Road and Brookfield Avenue intersection.

Plant 1 was the administrative headquarters, and also the leading repair facility. Plant 1 and Plant 2 were for marine unload operations. Barges arrived from the other boroughs (primarily Manhattan and Brooklyn). Refuse was picked up by a crane (called a &quot;digger&quot;) using a clamshell bucket and deposited in a caterpillar-tracked side-dump vehicle called an &quot;Athey wagon&quot; (not related to the equipment of the same name used for oil drilling).

Two wagons were then pulled to the active dumpsite by a tractor (Caterpillar D7, D8, D9) and emptied. The Plant 1 digger was electric, but the Plant 2 one was steam-powered. The diggers were supplemented by other cranes (mostly mounted on barges). A typical day would unload twelve barges (six at each plant). Operations were carried out from 8 am to midnight six days a week. The midnight to 8 am shift was for maintenance.

A wooden trestle bridge was built across Fresh Kills Creek to expand the Plant 2 operating area. This bridge allowed dumping east to Richmond Avenue. As the actual dump site moved further from paved roads, it became more difficult for trucks to unload. The Brookfield Avenue site was opened in 1966 and used exclusively for trucks.

During this period, the dump was in a state of flux. Original plans showed the dump with a twenty-year lifespan. One proposal for the West Shore Expressway bridge across Fresh Kills included a tide gate, which would have blocked Plant 2&#x27;s marine access. The bridge, when finally built in 1959, actually enhanced operations. The bridge was finished long before the rest of the expressway and was used by workers to travel between the two plants.

==Issues==
Initially, the land where the landfill was located was a salt marsh in which there were tidal wetlands, forests, and freshwater wetlands. The subsoil was made up of clay, with sand and silt as the top layer of soil. The tidal marsh, which helped to clean and oxygenate the water that passed through it, was destroyed by the dump. The fauna were largely replaced by herring gulls. The native plant species were driven out by the common reed, a grass that grows abundantly in disturbed areas and can tolerate both fresh and brackish water. The stagnant, deoxygenated water was also less attractive to waterfowl, and their population decreased. Samuel Kearing, who had served as sanitation commissioner under Mayor John V. Lindsay, remembered in 1970 his first visit to the Fresh Kills project:

It had a certain nightmare quality. ... I can still recall looking down on the operation from a control tower and thinking that Fresh Kills, like Jamaica Bay, had for thousands of years been a magnificent, teeming, literally life-enhancing tidal marsh. And in just twenty-five years, it was gone, buried under millions of tons of New York City&#x27;s refuse.

The environmental impact of the waste site was so significant that the base of the landfill was even discussed as the global starting point (GSSP) of the Anthropocene.

Animals were also a problem. Feral dog packs roamed the dump and were a hazard to employees. Rats also posed a problem. Attempts to suppress the population with poison failed. The area was declared a wild bird sanctuary, and some hawks, falcons, and owls were brought in. The area became a popular spot for birdwatching. Because of the predatory birds, rat sightings dropped dramatically, especially during the day.

From 1987 through 1988, in an environmental disaster known as the syringe tide, significant amounts of medical waste from the Fresh Kills landfill, including hypodermic syringes and raw garbage, washed up onto beaches on the Jersey Shore, in New York City, and on Long Island. This event forced the closing of beaches on the Atlantic coast. After much deliberation, New York City was required to pay $1 million for past pollution damages as well as pay for the cleanup. No reparations were paid to the business owners on the Jersey Shore for revenues lost during the months of inactivity.

==Closure==

As a result of intense community pressure, a state law was passed in 1996 requiring that the landfill cease accepting solid waste by the end of 2001. By 1997, two of the four landfill mounds were closed and covered with a thick, impermeable cap. The landfill received its last barge of garbage on March 22, 2001.

At its peak of operation in 1986–87, Fresh Kills received as much as of trash per day. It was estimated that, if kept open, the landfill would have eventually reached a height of or more. At this height, it would have been taller than Todt Hill making it the highest point on the East Coast south of Mount Desert Island in Maine. Under local pressure from Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, and with the support of mayor Rudy Giuliani, New York state governor George Pataki, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the landfill site was finally closed on March 22, 2001, though it was temporarily reopened soon after for the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in Manhattan (see below). The garbage once destined for Fresh Kills was shipped to landfills in other states, primarily in Pennsylvania, but also in Virginia and Ohio. Some garbage was also sent to New Jersey for incineration.

==Use after September 11 attacks ==

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Fresh Kills was temporarily reopened as a sorting ground for roughly a third of the rubble from Ground Zero. More than 1,600 personal effects were retrieved during this time. About of rubble came here for sorting.

Thousands of detectives and forensic evidence specialists worked for over 1.7 million hours at Fresh Kills Landfill to try to recover remnants of the people killed in the attacks. A final count of 4,257 human remains was retrieved, but only 300 people were identified from these remains. A memorial was built in 2011, which also honors those whose identities were not able to be determined from the debris. The remaining waste was buried in a portion of the landfill; it is highly likely that this debris still contains fragmentary human remains.

==Redevelopment==


The Fresh Kills site was transformed into reclaimed wetlands, recreational facilities and landscaped public parkland, the most significant expansion of the New York City parks since the development of the chain of parks in the Bronx during the 1890s. The new park was designed by James Corner Field Operations, the landscape architecture firm also responsible for the design of the High Line in Manhattan.

In January 2005, Staten Island Borough President James Molinaro announced plans to open three roads leading out of the former landfill to regular traffic, as part of an effort to ease road congestion. Construction on the actual park began in 2008. The three-phase development of the park, which includes a September 11 memorial, is expected to last 30 years. The draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was published for public review in May 2008. Construction drawings for the first phase of development in the South Park section were completed in mid-2011.

The Department of Parks and Recreation is responsible for implementing the plan for turning the landfill into a park. They used a Draft Master Plan that integrated three aspects—programming, wildlife, and circulation—and proposed five main parks: the Confluence, North Park, South Park, East Park, and West Park. With an eventual size of , Freshkills Park will be three times the size of the Central Park. It consists of a variety of public spaces and facilities for a multitude of activity types. The site is large enough to support many sports and programs including nature trails, horseback riding, mountain biking, community events, outdoor dining, sports fields, and canoeing/kayaking.

Schmul Park, the first section of Freshkills Park, opened to the public in 2012. Although the park is not scheduled for completion until 2037, the Parks Department reported that in 2010–11 two hundred species of wildlife had been seen in the former landfill. These included red-winged blackbirds, American goldfinches, red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, osprey, ring-necked pheasants, tree swallows, turkey vultures, and northern snapping turtles.

==Staten Island Transfer Station==
Staten Island Transfer Station occupies a small portion of the site of the former Fresh Kills Landfill near the old Plant #2 at . The transfer station—an integral part of New York City&#x27;s Solid Waste Management Plan—is expected to process an average of per day of Staten Island-generated residential and municipal waste. The waste is compacted inside the facility into sealed by intermodal shipping containers. These containers are then loaded, four containers each car, onto flatbed rail cars to be hauled by rail to a Republic Services landfill in South Carolina. The Staten Island Railway freight service, which connects the facility to the national rail freight network via the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge, was reactivated in April 2007, after it had been closed in 1991.

<text>James Porteous (1848–1922) was the Scottish-American inventor of the Fresno scraper.

James Porteous was born in Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland. His father, William Porteous, had been a wheelwright and blacksmith who built and repaired carriages, wagons and farm equipment. After learning his basic skills, James Porteous emigrated to the United States in 1873, at the age of 25, and settled in Santa Barbara, California. In 1877, he moved to Fresno and established a wagon shop, where he prospered, manufacturing buggies and heavy wagons.

Having worked with farmers, Porteous recognised the dependence of the San Joaquin Valley on irrigation and the requirement for a more efficient means of constructing canals and ditches in the sandy soil, and he went about the task of devising an earth moving scraper for that purpose.

Porteous invented an improvement on the simple buckboard, a horse-drawn earth scraper, and refined his Buck Scraper, as he first called it, through several design improvements. His ideas, combined with those of fellow-inventors William Deidrick, Frank Dusy, and Abijah McCall, all of Selma, California led to the Fresno scraper (1883). Porteous purchased patents held by Deidrick and jointly by partners Dusy and McCall as he perfected his machine. The basic design forms the basis of most modern earth moving scrapers, having the ability to not only scrape and move a quantity of soil, but also to discharge it at a controlled depth, thus quadrupling the volume which could be handled manually. 

The blade scooped up the soil, instead of merely pushing it along, and ran along a C-shaped bowl which could be adjusted in order to alter the angle of the bucket to the ground, so that the dirt could be deposited in low spots. This design was so revolutionary and economical that it has influenced the design of modern bulldozer blades and earth-movers to this day.

Porteous formed the Fresno Agricultural Works, which between 1884 and 1910 produced thousands of Fresno scrapers. The machines were used in agriculture and land leveling, as well as road and railroad grading and the general construction industry. They played a vital role in the construction of the Panama Canal and later served the US Army in World War I.

It was one of the most important agricultural and civil engineering machines ever made. In 1991 the Fresno scraper was designated as an International Historic Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. It was featured prominently in the Fresno Metropolitan Museum.

<text>The Crusaders (; formerly Canterbury Crusaders) are a New Zealand professional rugby union team based in Christchurch, who compete in the Super Rugby competition. They are the most successful team in the competition&#x27;s history and have won a total of 14 titles (1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022 and 2023, as well as two regionalised Super Rugby titles in 2020 and 2021).

Formed in 1996 to represent the upper South Island of New Zealand in the Super 12, the Crusaders represent the Buller, Canterbury, Mid-Canterbury, South Canterbury, Tasman and West Coast provincial Rugby Unions. Their main home ground since 2012 is Rugby League Park (known for sponsorship reasons as Apollo Projects Stadium). They formerly played out of Jade Stadium prior to it being damaged beyond repair in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.

The Crusaders struggled in the first season of the Super 12, 1996, finishing last. Their performance improved in 1997 and the team finished sixth (out of twelve teams). The team went on to win three titles from 1998 to 2000 despite each final being played away from home. They again won the competition in 2002 after going through the season unbeaten. In the following two seasons, they again reached the final, although they were beaten on both occasions. 2005 was the last season of the Super 12 before its expansion. After finishing top of the table in that season, the Crusaders went on to host the final in which they defeated the Waratahs. As a result of winning their fifth Super 12 title, the Crusaders were given the trophy to keep. In 2006, the Crusaders hosted the Hurricanes in the inaugural Super 14 final and won 19–12. In 2008 the Crusaders hosted the final at AMI Stadium against the Waratahs, and won the match 20–12 to claim their seventh title. Their eighth championship came in 2017 against the Lions. The Crusaders hosted the Lions in the 2018 final and won 37–18, securing their ninth title. The Crusaders won their tenth Super Rugby title at home against the Jaguares in 2019. The Crusaders won their 11th and 12th title in both editions of Super Rugby Aotearoa in 2020 and 2021. They won their 13th title (their 11th full Super Rugby title), by winning the inaugural Super Rugby Pacific final in 2022 against the at Eden Park in Auckland. The Crusaders won their 12th (14th overall) Super Rugby title after beating the 25–20 in the 2023 final in Hamilton.

The Crusaders have been led by only three CEOs throughout their 28-year history; former New Zealand Rugby CEO Steve Tew, Hamish Riach and incumbent Colin Mansbridge.

==History==

===Beginnings: 1996–1997===
The Crusaders franchise was created as one of five New Zealand teams in the Super 12. Originally named the &quot;Canterbury Crusaders&quot;, the Crusaders&#x27; franchise area encompassed the upper South Island of New Zealand (see &quot;Super Rugby franchise areas&quot;), and was formed from the Buller, Canterbury, Marlborough, Mid-Canterbury, Nelson Bays, South Canterbury, and West Coast rugby unions. The original Crusaders team of 1996 was captained by All Blacks prop Richard Loe and coached by Vance Stewart. The Crusaders struggled in the inaugural season and finished bottom of the table with only two wins. Their eight losses included a 49–18 loss to the Blues and a 52–16 loss to the Queensland Reds. And the First ever tour was a pre-visit to South Africa prior start of Super 12.

The following season saw a change in captain and coach, with Todd Blackadder succeeding Loe as captain and Wayne Smith taking over as coach. With five wins, the team finished the round-robin stage in sixth place. The improvement was particularly illustrated by the Crusaders&#x27; 29–28 loss to the defending champions, the Blues, which contrasted with their 49–18 loss the previous season. (The Blues also went on to win the 1997 title). During this loss, Leon MacDonald was taken out with a shoulder charge by Robin Brooke. While the Crusaders attempted to get MacDonald back on the field, the Blues scored two tries, including one by Brooke, who was later suspended for two weeks for the shoulder charge. In their last game of 1997, the Crusaders beat the Queensland Reds 48–3 at Lancaster Park.

===Hat trick: 1998–2000===
The Crusaders won their first title in 1998, despite starting the season with three losses in their first four games. They finished the round-robin by winning their last seven games, culminating in a last-round win over the Coastal Sharks (now the ) that gave them second place in the round-robin phase of the competition. Their second-placing allowed them to host their semi-final at Lancaster Park, where they won the match 36–32 against the Coastal Sharks.

In the final at Eden Park, the Crusaders faced the Blues, who were heavy favourites. According to Crusaders&#x27; hooker Mark Hammett, &quot;If we&#x27;d been polled in that week, and had to give an honest answer, most of the boys, deep down, would probably have thought that the Blues would beat us.&quot; The Crusaders were ahead 3–0 at half time, but the Blues scored first after half time to take a 10–3 lead after 53 minutes. After Crusader Norm Maxwell scored a try, the game was tied 10 all. Then, after a penalty each, the two teams were tied 13 all with one minute of regulation time remaining. At that moment, Andrew Mehrtens chipped the ball for James Kerr to run onto and score, giving the Crusaders a 20–13 win after the try was converted. The ten points scored by Andrew Mehrtens in the final contributed to his total of 206 points for the season − a record for the Super 12. Upon the Crusaders&#x27; return to Christchurch, they were given a parade through the city that drew 100,000 people.

The 1999 season was equally successful for the Crusaders despite struggling to make the play-offs in fourth place after winning their last four round-robin matches. They defeated the favoured Queensland Reds (who had finished top in the round-robin) in their semi-final to advance to the final against the Otago Highlanders (since renamed the &quot;Highlanders&quot;). The all-South Island final in Dunedin was promoted as &quot;the party at Tony Brown&#x27;s house&quot; after Highlanders first five-eighths Tony Brown. Again playing away from home, the Crusaders won 24–19. The decisive try of the match was scored by Crusaders winger Afato So&#x27;oalo when he chipped the ball, then out-sprinted All Blacks winger Jeff Wilson to collect the ball and score.

Following the All Blacks&#x27; semi-final loss in the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Wayne Smith succeeded John Hart as All Blacks coach. Crusaders manager Robbie Deans replaced Smith as Crusaders coach. In Deans&#x27; first year in charge, the Crusaders won their third title in a row − a feat that would be repeated in the 2017-2018-2019 seasons. The Crusaders finished second in the round-robin, earning them the right to host a semi-final in which they faced the Highlanders at Jade Stadium. Two tries in the final 20 minutes by Marika Vunibaka helped the Crusaders to a 37–15 win. The 2000 Super 12 Final was played against the Brumbies in Canberra, Australia, where the weather for the final was icy, with sleet and snow. The game was low-scoring, with only one try each. Four penalties by Mehrtens gave the Crusaders a 12–6 half time lead. Following a Brumbies penalty four minutes from time, the Brumbies led 19–17. However, the Crusaders were awarded a penalty from the resulting kick-off, and after Mehrtens converted the penalty, the Crusaders went on to win the game 20–19.

===Development of a legacy: 2001–2005===

After winning three consecutive Super 12 titles, the Crusaders finished tenth in 2001 – their worst finish since 1996. The season was the last for captain Todd Blackadder before he left to play for Edinburgh in Scotland.

The Crusaders bounced back dramatically in 2002 when they went through the Super 12 season unbeaten, achieving their fourth title. Although the Crusaders won all eleven of their round-robin matches, six of them were won by a margin of seven points or less. Their eleven round-robin games also included a record 96–19 win over the Waratahs in the final match of the round-robin stage, which was especially noteworthy given that both teams finished at the top of the table.

The Crusaders met the Highlanders in their 2002 semi-final, which they eventually won 34–23 after being ahead 18–6 at half time. The following week, they faced the Brumbies in the first final to be hosted at Jade Stadium. The Brumbies trailed 11–3 after the first half, having had only 30 per cent possession. Although the Brumbies closed the gap to 14–13 with eight minutes to go, the Crusaders held on and steadied to win 31–13 with a last-minute try to Caleb Ralph. The season was their first under the captaincy of Reuben Thorne, who went on to captain the All Blacks until the end of the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

The Crusaders&#x27; winning run finally came to an end when they were beaten 39–5 by the Blues in the third round of the 2003 Super 12 season. Although their 15-match unbeaten streak had ended, Richie McCaw said of the loss, &quot;...in some ways it was almost a relief. We&#x27;d finally been beaten, the run was over, so people could stop talking about it and we could get on with playing it week by week.&quot; The Crusaders recovered to finish second on the table with eight wins. They hosted a semi-final against the Hurricanes, who were coached by Colin Cooper, a former assistant coach for the Crusaders. Despite this inside knowledge of the team by the Wellington coach, the Crusaders won the match 39–16. In the final, the Crusaders met the Blues, another team coached by a former Crusaders assistant coach, Peter Sloane. Hooker Mark Hammett scored two tries to give the Crusaders a 10–6 lead at half-time. The Blues hit back to lead 21–10 with ten minutes to go. The Crusaders managed another converted try, but it was not enough, and the Blues won 21–17.

The Crusaders&#x27; 2004 season began with two losses: first to the Waratahs, then to the Blues. They recovered to again finish second on the table with seven wins. They played the Stormers at Jade Stadium in their semi-final, and won 27–16. They met the Brumbies at Canberra Stadium in a replay of the 2000 final. The Brumbies dominated in the final, scoring 33 unanswered points in the first 19 minutes. The Crusaders managed to salvage some pride by narrowing the loss to a 47–38 finish.

The 2005 season started with a repeat of the previous year&#x27;s final: a Brumbies victory over the Crusaders in Canberra. There was a win the following week at home over the Chiefs, followed by a win over the Reds at Trafalgar Park. Although there was a 35–20 loss to the Bulls after Crusaders captain Richie McCaw was knocked unconscious, they eventually finished the regular season top of the table. McCaw returned from his five weeks on the sideline to lead the Crusaders in their semi-final victory over the Hurricanes. They faced the Waratahs in the final at Jade Stadium. 
Leading 14–6 at halftime, the Crusaders then moved out to a 29-point lead. Despite three late tries by the Waratahs, the Crusaders won their fifth title with a 35–20 win.

As a reward for their seventh finals appearance and fifth title, the Crusaders were allowed to keep the Super 12 trophy. After the 2005 season, the franchise saw the departure of stalwarts Andrew Mehrtens and Justin Marshall, both of whom had played for the team since its formation in 1996.

===Super 14: 2006–2010===
In 2006, the Super 12 expanded to form the Super 14 when the Western Force from Perth, Australia, and the Cheetahs from the Free State and Northern Cape Provinces, South Africa joined the competition. An unbeaten run of sixteen matches was nearly halted when the Crusaders drew with the Western Force in Perth in round eleven. The following week, the unbeaten run was ended when the Crusaders lost to the Stormers in Cape Town. That loss was their only one of the year, as they finished top of the table with eleven wins. After beating the Bulls in their semi-final, the Crusaders faced the Hurricanes in the final at Jade Stadium that was played in a thick fog, causing poor visibility. Sections of the crowd could not see the field, and many spectators left during the match. The scorers were tied 9–9 going into the game&#x27;s last 20 minutes. The Crusaders&#x27; Casey Laulala then scored the game&#x27;s only try before the match finished 19–12.

In the 2007 Super 14 season, seven Crusaders players missed the first seven rounds of the competition to participate in an All Black &quot;conditioning programme&quot;. The conditioning programme was part of the All Blacks&#x27; 2007 Rugby World Cup preparations; 22 players were selected for the programme. The Crusaders&#x27; seven players in the programme was more than any other New Zealand Super 14 franchise. The Crusaders players were Chris Jack, Richie McCaw, Greg Somerville, Reuben Thorne, Dan Carter, Leon MacDonald, and Aaron Mauger. All but one of the seven returned to play for the Crusaders in their eighth round match against the Stormers (Greg Somerville did not return due to injury). The Crusaders climbed to second on the table before defeating the Western Force 53–0 at Jade Stadium in the tenth round. The victory over the Force was the one hundredth Super rugby win for the Crusaders – the first franchise to reach the milestone.

The Crusaders were top of the table going into the last round of the Super 14 before the play-offs. To guarantee a home semi-final they needed to defeat the Chiefs at Jade Stadium. The Chiefs won 30–24 – and ended the Crusaders 26 game winning streak at home. As the Bulls defeated the Reds 92–3 in the same round, they overtook the Crusaders to finish second in the round robin. The Crusaders then travelled to Pretoria to face the Bulls in their semi-final where they lost 27–12.

The 2008 season was another highly successful one for the Crusaders. After finishing top of the table at the end of the last round, they comfortably defeated the Hurricanes 33–22 in the semi-final, and went on to beat the Waratahs in the final 20–12. It was a fitting way to send off long-serving coach Robbie Deans before he departed to coach Australia. It was also the last game for Crusaders stalwarts Caleb Ralph and former captain Reuben Thorne. In July that year former captain Todd Blackadder was appointed Crusaders coach, and his former teammates Mark Hammett and Daryl Gibson were appointed as assistants.

The 2009 season started with a sole win and a draw from the Crusaders&#x27; first five matches; this included a 6–0 loss to the Highlanders. The side found its feet later in the season, and won key away games which ultimately saw them finish in fourth place on the table – just ahead of the Waratahs. Both the Crusaders and Waratahs finished the season with 41 competition points, but the Crusaders advanced through to the semi-finals due to a greater &#x27;points for and against&#x27; difference.

The Crusaders lost their semi-final to the Bulls 36–23 at Loftus Versfeld, Pretoria in front of a capacity 52,000 crowd. The Bulls went on to win the 2009 Super 14 title beating the Chiefs 61–17. Statistically, the Crusaders had the best defensive record of the 2009 competition – conceding just 198 points. However, points for, and total tries scored was the second lowest in the competition with just 231 points and 27 tries.

In 2010 the Crusaders had a very good start to the season before a poor finish with three losses in four games caused them to have to travel to Orlando Stadium, Soweto to face the Bulls. They lost the semi-final 39–24.

===2011–2016===
The 2011 season had a minor hiccup at the very beginning with a two-point loss to the Blues. Their second round match against the Hurricanes was cancelled, and match declared a draw after the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February which caused 182 deaths. In their first match after the earthquake they played the Waratahs, a team that had only conceded six points in their previous two games. The Crusaders triumphed 33–18 in a convincing display in front of a sold-out stadium. They next played the Brumbies and brushed them aside in a 52–10 demolition. They next played the Highlanders who had previously only lost one match in the season, to the undefeated and table-topping Stormers. The Crusaders won comfortably 44–13 in Dunedin. The next team they played, the Sharks, had like the Highlanders previously only lost one match in the season before the Crusaders won 44–28 at Twickenham for a one-off match due to earthquake damage at their own ground. They played the second match in a sell-out crowd at Fraser Park in Timaru against the Bulls winning 27–0. Round 9 they played the Chiefs in Mt Maunganui and gained four tries winning 34–16 with Richie McCaw returning after eight weeks off with injury. The Crusaders lost the final at the Suncorp Stadium to the Queensland Reds. Will Genia scored a crucial try for the Reds to help them to an 18–13 win.

The 2012 season, the first in the new home ground of Christchurch Stadium, saw the Crusaders again reach the playoffs. However, they were defeated by the (eventual champion) Chiefs in the semi-final.

===2017–2023===

In 2017, Scott Robertson took over as head coach. The Crusaders lost 12–3 to the British &amp; Irish Lions at Christchurch, during the Lions tour to New Zealand.

The team went on to win their 8th Super Rugby title, defeating the 25–17 in the final on 5 August 2017 at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg.

In 2018, the Crusaders again played the Lions in the final. This time they won 37–18 at home to capture their ninth title.

In 2019, they defeated the from Argentina 19–3 at home to win their 3rd consecutive Super Rugby title, and 10th championship overall.

After 7 rounds of the 2020 Super Rugby season, the Crusaders were leading the NZ conference and were in 3rd overall (behind the Sharks and Brumbies) but the COVID-19 pandemic stopped the competition after the 7th round. However, in June 2020 a domestic Super Rugby competition started called Super Rugby Aotearoa. The Crusaders won the overall title in Super Rugby Aotearoa 2020, winning 7 out of 8 games. Their 36-game win streak at Orangetheory Stadium was however broken by the Hurricanes in Round 7, who defeated them 32–34. They also dropped the physical trophy in post-match celebrations, chipping the pounamu &quot;mere&quot; on it.

The Crusaders returned to Super Rugby Aotearoa in 2021 and made it all the way to the final, despite losses to the Highlanders (12–33) and the Chiefs (26–25) where they faced the Chiefs and won their 5th consecutive title in a 24–13 win. Following that, they went into the Super Rugby Trans Tasman competition and beat the Brumbies (31–29), Reds (28–63), Waratahs (28–54), Force (29–21) and Rebels (26–52) but just came up short on points needed to be able to make the final.

In 2022 and 2023, the Crusaders won their 11th and 12th full Super Rugby title (14th Overall) in the newly formed Super Rugby Pacific competition by beating the Blues (21–7) and the Chiefs (25–20). At the end of the 2023 Grand Final, the Scott Robertson dynasty was complete and it marked the end of an era for Crusader #26 as a former player and as head coach.

===2024–===

In June 2023, Rob Penney was announced as the Crusaders Head Coach for 2024 and 2025. After winning 7 consecutive titles, the Crusaders slumped to a 4 win and 10 loss season in 2024 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2015. After a thorough review of an abysmal 2024 season, the Crusaders decided to keep Penney as Head Coach for 2025 and will finish out the remainder of his 2 year contract with the team.

==Name and colours==

According to the club, the Crusaders&#x27; name was chosen to reflect the &quot;crusading nature of Canterbury rugby&quot;. A potential name was also the &quot;Plainsmen&quot;; however, this was not chosen, as &quot;Crusaders&quot; recalled the English heritage of the city of Christchurch.

The club adopted Canterbury&#x27;s traditional sporting colours of red and black, as worn by Canterbury.

In the aftermath of the 15 March 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand which killed 51 people and injured 50 more, the Crusaders considered the idea changing the team name because the symbolism and imagery was considered to be &quot;offensive to some in the community due to its association with the religious Crusades between Christians and Muslims&quot; according to New Zealand Rugby Executive Steve Tew but ultimately though it was kept and remained unchanged for the 2020 season. The Crusaders management led by Colin Mansbridge, revealed a new logo to replace the knight and sword in late 2019.

==Franchise area==


The Crusaders&#x27; franchise area consists of the regions controlled by the Buller, Canterbury, Mid-Canterbury, South Canterbury, Tasman and West Coast rugby unions. Before 2006, when the NPC was reorganised, Canterbury was the only union playing division one (now Bunnings NPC) within the Crusaders&#x27; catchment. As a result, the majority of Crusaders players were also listed with Canterbury. Today, the Crusaders&#x27; catchment contains two Bunnings NPC sides – Canterbury and Tasman.

==Grounds==
The Crusaders&#x27; main home ground was the 36,000-capacity AMI Stadium in Christchurch. However, they stopped playing there during the 2011 Super Rugby season due to damage inflicted by the February Christchurch earthquake. The Crusaders usually took one game each year to another part of the franchise area, most often when the New Zealand cricket team was playing at AMI Stadium. Previous venues included Trafalgar Park in Nelson, and Fraser Park in Timaru.

With AMI Stadium still out of commission, the Crusaders adopted Rugby League Park (which has been renamed Christchurch Stadium temporarily) in Addington as their home ground for that and future seasons to recentralise their games in one location as opposed to the road show that was the 2011 season. The ground had a limited makeover, taking it to an 18,600 capacity stadium and bringing its facilities to the minimum standards required by the Super Rugby competition.

The Crusaders&#x27; management proposed playing a 2005 regular season match in Melbourne when Jade Stadium was unavailable. Although five of the seven unions within the Crusaders region supported having the regular season game in Melbourne, the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) vetoed the proposal. In 2006, the Crusaders did play a pre-season match in Melbourne against the Western Force at Olympic Park Stadium. They did the same in the 2008 preseason as well, also against the Force.

Due to the 2011 earthquake, the Crusaders played four games at Trafalgar Park, and two in Timaru during their 2011 season. They also played a &quot;home&quot; game in Wellington in Round 18 against Hurricanes, and a special home match against the Sharks at Twickenham in London. The London match was a fundraiser for earthquake relief, and was the first Super Rugby match ever contested outside of the three participating countries. In the first 30 hours of ticket sales, over 30,000 were purchased; a spokesman for United Ticketmaster indicated that the response was the strongest he had experienced for a rugby match outside of internationals.

In January 2023 construction began on Te Kaha Stadium as a new home grounds for the Crusaders. The stadium will seat 30,000 spectators, and will feature a fixed roof, becoming the second fully-covered stadium in New Zealand after Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin. The current planned date for opening is April 2026.

==Development team==
The Crusaders have fielded a development team in competitions such as the Pacific Rugby Cup and in matches against other representative teams for several seasons. Known as the Crusaders Development XV or Crusaders Knights, the squad is selected from the best emerging rugby talent in the Crusaders catchment area and is composed of Crusaders contracted players, wider training group members, under 20s, and selected club players.

(Record updated as of 2025 season)

In addition to winning more Super Rugby titles than any other team, the franchise also holds several competition records, including most points in a game and most tries in a game, both achieved in their 96–19 victory over the Waratahs in 2002. The Crusaders also hold the record for the fewest points scored in a game when they were defeated by the Highlanders 6–0 in 2009. They have also scored the most points in a season (677) in 2018 and most tries in a season (94) in 2018.

Individual players also hold records: Andrew Mehrtens for most points in a Super 12 season (206 in 1998), and Rico Gear for most tries in a season (15 in 2005). Twenty Four players have played over 100 games for the franchise: Wyatt Crockett, Samuel Whitelock, Kieran Read, Andy Ellis, Owen Franks, Ryan Crotty, Corey Flynn, Richie McCaw, Dan Carter, Matt Todd, Luke Romano, Mitchell Drummond, Codie Taylor, Rueben Thorne, Caleb Ralph, Leon MacDonald, David Havili, Joe Moody, Greg Somerville, Chris Jack, Scott Barrett, Richie Mo&#x27;unga, Justin Marshall, Jordan Taufua. The Crusaders have also had three International Rugby Board Players of the Year: Dan Carter (2005), (2012), (2015), Richie McCaw (2006), (2009), (2010) and Kieran Read (2013).

===List of All Blacks===

Due to the success of the Crusaders throughout Super Rugby, many players that have represented the Crusaders have gone on to play international test rugby for the All Blacks. List of All Blacks that have represented the Crusaders:

===Notable players===
Twenty Four players have played over 100 games for the franchise.

In order of most capped:

*Wyatt Crockett (202)
*Samuel Whitelock (180)
*Owen Franks (163)
*Kieran Read (157)
*Ryan Crotty (156)
*Andy Ellis (155)
*Corey Flynn (151)
*Richie McCaw (145)
*Mitchell Drummond (144)
*Dan Carter (141)
*Matt Todd (141)
*Luke Romano (136)
*Codie Taylor (134)
*David Havili (130)
*Reuben Thorne (129)
*Joe Moody (128)
*Caleb Ralph (126)
*Leon MacDonald (122)
*Scott Barrett (119)
*Greg Somerville (115)
*Chris Jack (114)
*Richie Mo&#x27;unga (109)
*Justin Marshall (105)
*Jordan Taufua (101)

Half-back Justin Marshall was the first player to achieve the feat, playing for the Crusaders between 1996 and 2005. Both Thorne and Ralph achieved the 100-game mark at the same time. However, Ralph had played nine of his matches for other franchises: three for the Chiefs and six for the Blues. Ralph achieved the &quot;100 Crusaders games&quot; feat later that season; remarkably, they were played consecutively. Greg Somerville became the next player to contribute 100 games for the franchise, achieving this in the 2006 semi-final against the Bulls. The first match of the 2008 season was Leon MacDonald&#x27;s 100th game, and on 11 March 2011 Chris Jack started against the Brumbies to play his 100th match for the Crusaders. The Crusaders also boast three winners of the IRB International Player of the Year Award: Dan Carter (2005, 2012 and 2015), Kieran Read (2013) and Richie McCaw (2006, 2009 and 2010).

=== 1996–2005 Team of the decade ===
On the eve of the last Super 12 final in 2005, a panel of experts picked the Crusaders team of the decade, which was published by the Christchurch Press. The experts chosen to select the team were: Tane Norton (former All Blacks captain), Vance Stewart (first Crusaders coach), Dick Tayler (president of supporters club), Bob Schumacher (former Christchurch Press rugby writer) and Tony Smith (Christchurch Press rugby writer).

The most notable omissions from the team were Dan Carter, Richard Loe, and Reuben Thorne. Daniel Carter was omitted due to the strength of Andrew Mehrtens and Aaron Mauger who occupied the first and second five-eighth positions respectively, and because he was regarded as &quot;the star of the next decade&quot;. Despite being considered one of Canterbury&#x27;s best ever props, Richard Loe missed out as he was only in the team for the unsuccessful 1996 season. The former All Black captain Reuben Thorne was omitted due to the quality of players in the lock and blindside flanker positions. The most unlikely inclusion was for Norm Berryman at right wing. Berryman was picked over Marika Vunibaka and Afato So&#x27;oalo due to his crucial tries late in the 1998 and 1999 seasons that helped the Crusaders qualify for the semi-finals. The team:

===Crusaders Hall of Fame===

A Crusaders Hall of Fame was created in 2023. A selection committee was formed to meet twice a year and help select the annual inductees. The committee announced was: Bob Stewart (Chairperson), John Miles, Brian Ashby, Lesley Murdoch, Sam Broomhall, Angus Gardiner, Scott Robertson and Sam Whitelock.

The Hall of fame inductees are:

*(1) Todd Blackadder
*(2) Justin Marshall
*(3) Wayne Smith
*(4) Norm Maxwell
*(5) Leon MacDonald
*(6) Reuben Thorne

==Coaches==
The Crusaders were coached in their first season by Vance Stewart, who was assisted by Aussie Mclean. Stewart was replaced by Wayne Smith in 1997; McLean too was replaced, by Peter Sloane. Smith continued as coach until he was appointed All Blacks coach after the 1999 season. Robbie Deans took over the reins for the 2000 season. Deans has had several assistants: in 2000 and 2001 his assistant was Steve Hansen; in 2002, Colin Cooper; in 2003 and 2004, Don Hayes; and in 2005 and 2006, Vern Cotter. Deans&#x27; assistant for the 2007 season was former Crusader Mark Hammett. Deans was appointed coach of Australia in December 2007, but was allowed to continue coaching the Crusaders in the 2008 season. Former captain, Todd Blackadder was appointed his successor in July 2008, with Hammett continuing as assistant coach. Hammett was appointed Hurricanes coach from the beginning of the 2011 season, and consequently former prop Dave Hewett was appointed assistant forwards coach. In June 2016, Scott Robertson, former Crusaders player and former head coach of the Canterbury National Provincial Team and the New Zealand Under 20 Rugby Team, was announced as the Crusaders Head Coach from 2017, and finished his tenure with the team in 2023. On June 6, 2023, Rob Penney was announced as the replacement for Scott Robertson as head coach of the Crusaders. He will also be assisted by former Crusaders Flanker Matt Todd from 2024 onwards.

<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, a patriarchal blessing or evangelist blessing is administered by the laying on of hands, with accompanying words of counsel, reassurance and lifelong guidance intended solely for those receiving the blessing. The words are spoken by an ordained patriarch (evangelist) of the church, but are believed to be inspired by the Holy Ghost. These blessings are given in both the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ. The patriarchal/evangelist blessings are modeled after the blessing given by Jacob to each of his sons prior to his death.

Other blessings of comfort, healing, and guidance may be received at any time throughout a person&#x27;s life, but a patriarchal/evangelist blessing is unique in that it is considered to be an ordinance (LDS church), respectively a sacrament (Community of Christ). Other differences concerning patriarchal/evangelist blessings in these churches, for example, concerning whom can receive the blessing and when, or the scope and content of the blessing, are described in the respective sections below.

==In early Mormonism==
The first Latter Day Saint patriarchal blessings were performed by Joseph Smith Sr., the father of Joseph Smith, who ordained his father to the role of patriarch on December 18, 1833. Smith Sr. gave his son a blessing on December 9, 1834, prophesying that the younger Smith would establish Zion, subdue his enemies, enjoy his posterity to the latest generation, and &quot;stand on the earth&quot; to witness the Second Coming (after the resurrection, in preparation for Judgement Day). That same day, Joseph Smith Sr. gathered all of his children and their spouses together to give each of them patriarchal blessings. Before Joseph Sr. died on September 14, 1840, he ordained his eldest living son, Hyrum Smith, to succeed him as Patriarch to the Church. From that time forward, Hyrum gave patriarchal blessings until his own death on June 27, 1844.

==In the LDS Church==
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), a patriarchal blessing is an ordinance which is given when an authorized patriarch (a man ordained to the priesthood office of patriarch) places his hands on the head of the recipient and pronounces said blessing. The recipient must have previously received a recommendation for the blessing from his or her bishop. This is dependent on an interview by which the bishop determines the applicant&#x27;s worthiness and readiness. The purpose of a patriarchal blessing is (1) to identify the tribe of Israel to which the individual belongs, whether literal or &quot;adopted&quot;, along with the responsibilities and blessings associated; (2) to bless the member with knowledge and the spiritual gifts that may be obtained by obedience to gospel principles; (3) to give advice or help to the individual (often this includes foretelling of possible future events, opportunities, and temptations). Within the church, a patriarchal blessing is considered to be a revelation for the recipient, with the promises made in the blessing considered conditional upon the recipient&#x27;s obedience to gospel principles.

A person is informed of the tribe of Israel to which they belong. This is done to acknowledge the fulfillment of the church doctrine that through baptism, members become part of the House of Israel. Additionally, it is believed that each tribe differs and a person may come to understand the unique circumstances of his or her life better by knowing to which tribe they belong. The differences between the tribes are generally acknowledged to arise from the differences in the blessings Jacob pronounced upon his sons and Joseph&#x27;s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh.

A patriarchal blessing is usually pronounced upon a member only once. In rare circumstances, a person may receive permission to receive an additional patriarchal blessing. The blessing is usually performed in the home of the patriarch or of the seeker. In general, only close family members, such as parents or the person&#x27;s spouse, are present. The patriarch places his hands on the seated person&#x27;s head and speaks the blessing aloud. A record of the blessing is made at the same time. Transcribed copies of all blessings are stored in church records and are considered by the church to be revelation.

Members receive a copy of the blessing, and are advised to consult it throughout their lives. Since adherents believe the blessings are direct revelation from God, the church advises members to treat them as sacred, not to be shared casually with others.

Any member found worthy and spiritually mature by their priesthood leader may receive a patriarchal blessing. Individuals who have been members from childhood generally ask to receive their patriarchal blessing as adolescents.

According to former church president Ezra Taft Benson, &quot;A patriarchal blessing is the inspired and prophetic statement of your life&#x27;s mission together with blessings, cautions, and admonitions as the patriarch may be prompted to give.&quot; Blessings given in the 19th century often made use of themes, such as millennialism and polygamy, that are not common in today&#x27;s blessings. During his presidency, Joseph Fielding Smith advised patriarchs to be conservative in their blessings unless &quot;especially inspired otherwise&quot;.

Although they are not generally ordained patriarchs, every Latter-day Saint father who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood can pronounce blessings upon his child or spouse, as necessary. Such blessings do not reveal the Tribe of Israel to which a person belongs. The church encourages families to create their own records of such blessings, but does not accept them into the official church archives in Salt Lake City as they would a blessing from an ordained patriarch.

Those who have received a patriarchal blessing are told to read it &quot;humbly, prayerfully, and frequently.&quot; By following the counsel in a patriarchal blessing, they can better understand and receive the blessings contained therein.

According to historian D. Michael Quinn, patriarchs were paid in the early days of the LDS Church. The practice of paying patriarchs diminished in the 20th century and was officially ended in 1943. &quot;&#x27;Both the Presiding Patriarch and local stake patriarchs charged a fee. In the 1840s the fee was $1 per patriarchal blessing at Nauvoo; by the end of the nineteenth century it had increased to $2 per blessing. Joseph Smith Sr. gave patriarchal blessings without payment of a fee, but would not record them. &#x27;Uncle&#x27; John Smith commented that he &quot;lived very poor ever since we left Kirtland Ohio&quot; (from January 1838 until January 1844). Then his nephew, Joseph Smith, ordained him a patriarch &#x27;through which office I obtained a comfortable living.&#x27; &quot;...Patriarchal blessing fees ended in 1902, although patriarchs were allowed to accept unsolicited donations. Not until 1943 did church authorities prohibit patriarchs from accepting gratuities for giving blessings.&quot;

===Lineage===
As with the pre-1844 church led by Joseph Smith, an important part of patriarchal blessing in the LDS Church is the declaration of lineage. Members receiving the blessing are told to which of the twelve Israelite tribes they belong. Opinions differ as to whether the lineage is intended to mean literal ancestry, or whether the lineage is metaphorical or adoptive, as there are many recorded instances of children having a different lineage from their parents. Daniel H. Ludlow has said &quot;in a patriarchal blessing, lineage is being declared ... when terms indicating direct descent are used, such as &#x27;son of,&#x27; &#x27;daughter of,&#x27; &#x27;seed of,&#x27; &#x27;blood of,&#x27; &#x27;descendant of,&#x27; or &#x27;from the loins of.&#x27;&quot; The church also teaches that &quot;[b]ecause each of us has many bloodlines running in us, two members of the same family may be declared as being of different tribes in Israel&quot;. In the early 19th and 20th centuries, members were more likely to believe they were literally descended from a certain tribe.

In 1961, the Church Historian&#x27;s Office reported that other lineages had been given, including from Cain to some Black members. In 1971, the Presiding Patriarch stated that non-Israelite tribes should not be given as a lineage in a patriarchal blessing. In a 1980 address to students at Brigham Young University, James E. Faust attempted to assure listeners that if they had no declared lineage in their patriarchal blessing, that the Holy Ghost would &quot;purge out the old blood, and make him actually of the seed of Abraham.&quot; The overwhelming majority of blessings declare the recipient to be a member of the tribe of Ephraim or Manasseh. Ephraim is the dominant tribe declared for people of European descent and Manasseh dominates for Pacific Islanders and South Americans. Jews have typically been assigned to the tribe of Judah.

===Black people and patriarchal blessings===
In Elijah Abel&#x27;s 1836 patriarchal blessing, no lineage was declared, but he was promised in the afterlife he&#x27;d be equal to his fellow members. Jane Manning James&#x27;s blessing in 1844 gave the lineage of Ham. After the priesthood ban, Black people were still allowed patriarchal blessings but were denied declaration of lineage out of policy. However, the guidelines were inconsistent. In Brazil, this was interpreted to mean that if a patriarch pronounced a lineage, then the member was not a descendant of Cain and was therefore eligible for the priesthood, despite physical or genealogical evidence of Black African ancestry. In 1934, patriarch James H. Wallis wrote in his journal that he had always known that Black people could not receive a patriarchal blessing because of the temple and priesthood ban, but that they could, however, receive one without a lineage.

After the 1978 revelation, patriarchs sometimes declared lineage in patriarchal blessings for Black members, but sometimes they did not declare a lineage. Some Black members have asked for and received new patriarchal blessings including a lineage.

==In the Community of Christ==
In the Community of Christ, the evangelist blessing is one of the eight sacraments of the church, along with baptism, confirmation, communion (the Lord’s Supper), ordination, the blessing of children, the laying on of hands for the sick, and marriage. The term patriarchal blessing was renamed &quot;evangelist blessing&quot; (sometimes called evangelist&#x27;s blessing) in 1985, to reflect the change in terminology from patriarch to the gender-neutral &quot;Evangelist&quot; when women were first ordained to offices of the priesthood. An evangelist blessing may be said for individuals, couples, families, households, groups, and congregations. Time is spent in preparation through prayer, spiritual practices, study, and discernment. An evangelist or team of evangelists will guide the preparation. Once adequate preparation is completed, the evangelist(s) offers a prayer. The sacrament of evangelist blessing is available to people of all beliefs and faith traditions who understand its purpose and desire to receive it. Traditionally, children of eight years of age or older can receive a blessing, although the blessing is rarely offered for someone who has not reached adolescence.

A blessing need not be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and may be received at various points of need or times of transition. For an individual, this could involve for example serious illness, career change, retirement etc. Although tribal lineage was revealed in earlier years, that practice is no longer common.

==Criticisms==
Some former Mormons and LDS Church critics have said that patriarchal blessings are similar to fortune telling, and that like fortune telling the practice unfairly gives members false information that members will often later use to make major life decisions. According to an article from Mormonism Research Ministry, the blessings&#x27; fulfillment are often conditioned on members&#x27; faithfulness to the church, helping keep members obedient to church leaders and blaming themselves rather than the patriarch when the promises are not fulfilled.

<text>A hoe is an ancient and versatile agricultural and horticultural hand tool used to shape soil, remove weeds, clear soil, and harvest root crops. Shaping the soil includes piling soil around the base of plants (hilling), digging narrow furrows (drills) and shallow trenches for planting seeds or bulbs. Weeding with a hoe includes agitating the surface of the soil or cutting foliage from roots, and clearing the soil of old roots and crop residues. Hoes for digging and moving soil are used to harvest root crops such as potatoes.

==Types==

There are many kinds of hoes of varied appearances and purposes. Some offer multiple functions, while others have only a singular and specific purpose.

There are two general types of hoe: draw hoes for shaping soil, and scuffle hoes for weeding and aerating soil.

A draw hoe has a blade set at approximately a right angle to the shaft. The user chops into the ground and then pulls (draws) the blade towards them. Altering the angle of the handle can cause the hoe to dig deeper or more shallowly as the hoe is pulled. A draw hoe can easily be used to cultivate soil to a depth of several centimetres. A typical design of draw hoe, the &quot;eye hoe&quot;, has a ring in the head through which the handle is fitted. This design has been used since Roman times.

A scuffle hoe is used to scrape the surface of the soil, loosen the top few centimetres, and to cut the roots of, remove, and disrupt the growth of weeds efficiently. These are primarily of two different designs: the Dutch hoe and the hoop hoe.

A hand hoe is usually a light-weight, short-handled hoe of any type, although it may be used simply to contrast hand-held tools against animal- or machine-pulled tools.

===Draw hoes===


* The typical farming and gardening hoe with a heavy, broad blade and a straight edge is known as the Italian hoe, grub hoe, grubbing hoe, azada (from Spanish), grab hoe, pattern hoe or dago hoe (&quot;dago&quot; being an ethnic slur referring to Italians, Spaniards, or Portuguese).
* The ridging hoe, also known as the Warren hoe and the drill hoe, is a triangular (point-down) or heart-shaped draw hoe that is particularly useful for digging narrow furrows (&quot;drills&quot;) and shallow trenches for the planting of seeds or bulbs.
* The Paxton hoe is similar to the Italian hoe, but with a more rounded rectangular blade.
* The flower hoe has a very small blade, rendering it useful for light weeding and aerating around growing plants, so as not to disturb their shallow roots while removing weeds beyond the reach of the gardener&#x27;s arm.
*The hoedad, hoedag or hodag is a hoe-like tool used to plant trees. According to Hartzell (1987, p. 29), &quot;The hoedag [was] originally called skindvic hoe... Hans Rasmussen, legendary contractor and timber farm owner, is credited with having invented the curved, convex, round-nosed hoedag blade which is widely used today&quot; (emphasis added).
* The mortar hoe is a tool specific to the manual mixing of mortar and concrete, and has the appearance of a typical square-bladed draw hoe with the addition of large holes in the blade.

===Scuffle hoes===

* The Dutch hoe is designed to be pushed or pulled through the soil to cut the roots of weeds just under the surface. A Dutch hoe has a blade &quot;sharp on every side so as to cut either forward and backward&quot;. The blade must be set in a plane slightly upwardly inclined in relation to the dual axis of the shaft. The user pushes the handle to move the blade forward, forcing it below the surface of the soil and maintaining it at a shallow depth by altering the angle of the handle while pushing. A scuffle hoe can easily cultivate the soil and remove weeds from the surface layer.
* The hoop hoe, also known as the action hoe, oscillating hoe, hula hoe, stirrup hoe, scuffle hoe, loop hoe, pendulum weeder, or swivel hoe) has a double-edge blade that bends around to form a rectangle attached to the shaft. Weeds are cut just below the surface of the soil as the blade is pushed and pulled. The back and forth motion is highly effective at cutting weeds in loose or friable soil. The width of the blade typically ranges between . The head is a loop of flat, sharpened strap metal. However, it is not as efficient as a draw hoe for moving soil.
* The collinear hoe or collineal hoe has a narrow, razor-sharp blade which is used to slice the roots of weeds by skimming it just under the surface of the soil with a sweeping motion; it is unsuitable for tasks like soil moving and chopping. It was designed by Eliot Coleman in the late 1980s.
* The swoe hoe is a modern, one-sided cutting hoe, being a variant of the Dutch hoe.

===Other hoes===
Hoes resembling neither draw nor scuffle hoes include:

* Wheel hoes are, as the name suggests, a hoe or pair of hoes attached to one or more wheels. The hoes are frequently interchangeable with other tools. The historic manufacturer of the wheel hoe was Planet JR, these wheel hoes are still produced by Hoss Tools.

* Horse hoes, resembling small ploughs, were a favourite implement of agricultural pioneer Jethro Tull, who claimed in his book &quot;Horse Hoeing Husbandry&quot; that &quot;the horse-hoe will, in wide intervals, give wheat throughout all the stages of its life, as much nourishment as the discreet hoer pleases.&quot; The modern view is that, rather than nutrients being released, the crop simply benefits from the removal of competing plants. The introduction of the horse hoe, together with the better-known seed drill, brought about the great increase farming productivity seen during the British Agricultural Revolution.
* Fork hoes (also known as prong hoes, tined hoes, Canterbury hoes, drag forks or bent forks) are hoes that have two or more tines at right angles to the shaft. Their use is typically to loosen the soil, prior to planting or sowing.
* Clam hoes, made for clam digging
* Adze hoes, with the basic hoe shape but heavier and stronger and with traditional uses in trail making.
* Pacul or cangkul (hoes similar to adze hoe from Malaysia and Indonesia)
* Gang hoes for powered use (in use at least from 1887 to 1964).
==History==
 Hoes are an ancient technology, predating the plough and perhaps preceded only by the digging stick. In Sumerian mythology, the invention of the hoe was credited to Enlil, the chief of the council of gods. The hoe features in a Sumerian disputation poem known as the Debate between the hoe and the plough, dating to the 3rd millennium BC, where a personified hoe debates a personified plough over which tool is the better. At the end of the poem, the hoe is declared the winner. Another composition from the same era and language, the Song of the hoe, is dedicated to the praise of this tool.

The hand-plough (&quot;mr&quot;) was depicted in predynastic Egyptian art, and hoes are also mentioned in ancient documents like the Code of Hammurabi (ca. 18th century BC) and the Book of Isaiah (c. 8th century BC).

Long-term use of short-handled hoes, which required the user to bend over from the waist to reach the ground, could cause permanent, crippling lower back pain to farm workers. Over time, this resulted in change after a struggle led by César Chávez with the political help of Governor Jerry Brown in the California Supreme Court. They declared that the short-handled hoe was an unsafe hand tool, which was then banned under California law in 1975.

==Archaeological use==

Over the past fifteen or twenty years, hoes have become increasingly popular tools for professional archaeologists. While not as accurate as the traditional trowel, the hoe is an ideal tool for cleaning relatively large open areas of archaeological interest. It is faster to use than a trowel, and produces a much cleaner surface than an excavator bucket or shovel-scrape, and consequently on many open-area excavations the once-common line of kneeling archaeologists trowelling backwards has been replaced with a line of stooping archaeologists with hoes.

<doc id="432099" wikidata="Q4743788" url="?curid=432099" title="American Flyer">
<text>American Flyer is a brand of toy train and model railroad, originally manufactured in the United States.

== The Chicago era, 1907–1938 ==
Although best remembered for the S gauge trains of the 1950s that it made as a division of the A. C. Gilbert Company, American Flyer was initially an independent company whose origins date back nearly a half century earlier. Chicago, Illinois-based toymaker William Frederick Hafner developed a clockwork motor for toy cars in 1901 while working for a company called Toy Auto Company. According to the recollections of William Hafner&#x27;s son, John, he had developed a clockwork train running on O gauge track by 1905.

Hafner&#x27;s friend, William Ogden Coleman, gained control of the Edmonds-Metzel Hardware Company, a struggling hardware manufacturer in Chicago, in 1906 or 1907. Hafner and Coleman began producing toy trains using Edmonds-Metzel&#x27;s excess manufacturing capability after Hafner was able to secure $15,000 worth of orders. By 1907, two American retailers, G. Sommers &amp; Co. and Montgomery Ward, were selling Hafner-Coleman aka Edmonds-Metzel trains. In 1908, Edmonds-Metzel adopted the American Flyer brand name for the trains, and by 1910, Edmonds-Metzel was out of the hardware business and changed its name to American Flyer Manufacturing Company.

Initially American Flyer—aka &quot;Chicago Flyer&quot;—was something of a budget brand, undercutting the prices of Ives, which was at the time the market leader. The trains proved popular, and American Flyer was soon expanding its product line. However, the company&#x27;s rapid growth led to strains in the relationship between Hafner and Coleman.

In 1913, Hafner left the company. Believing he would be given a significant portion of the company if the trains proved successful, Coleman refused when Hafner asked to exercise this option. Hafner started the Hafner Manufacturing Company, which sold a line of trains called Overland Flyer. Sommers immediately stopped carrying the American Flyer trains in favor of Hafner&#x27;s brand. Initially, the Hafner and American Flyer product lines were very similar, suggesting they may have been built using the same tooling. This suggests the possibility of the two companies continuing to collaborate. Hafner&#x27;s business survived as a manufacturer of clockwork trains until 1951, when he sold his business to All Metal Products Company.

American Flyer&#x27;s business grew during World War I, which locked out the German manufacturers that had dominated the U.S. toy train market to that point. During this time, American Flyer also introduced bicycle and motorcycle toys, segmented its market by creating both a low-priced and a high-priced line, and began to depart from its earlier designs by William Hafner.

In 1918, American Flyer introduced its first electric train, an O gauge model that was simply a windup model with an electric motor in place of the clockwork motor. This was a common practice at the time. The same year, William Coleman died and his son, William Ogden Coleman, Jr., took over the company. At that time the factory and administrative offices of the American Flyer Manufacturing Co. were located at 2219-2239 South Halsted Street in Chicago. The factory had its own railroad sidings and dock so cars could be slid inside the building for unloading/loading.

In 1925, American Flyer began offering Wide gauge electric trains at a premium price, attempting to compete with Lionel Corporation at the high end of the market. Like most of its competition, American Flyer did well in the 1920s, selling more than half a million trains in its best years, but suffered in the Great Depression, during which the company&#x27;s focus shifted back to the more economical O gauge trains.

In 1928, American Flyer&#x27;s competitor Ives went bankrupt. American Flyer and Lionel jointly purchased and operated Ives until 1930, when American Flyer sold its share to Lionel. During this time of joint operation, American Flyer supplied Ives with car bodies and other parts.

During the early 1930s, American Flyer struggled under increased competition, especially at the low end of the market. In 1931, Flyer announced it would not produce an electric train set to sell for less than $4 like its competition had. However, within three months, it relented and released a train without transformer that sold for $3.95, and in 1932, it released a set with transformer that retailed for $3.50. Sales increased, but the company was not profitable. Expansion into other toy arenas also failed.

== A. C. Gilbert Company, 1938–1966 ==
In December, 1937, W.O. Coleman sold American (Chicago) Flyer to Alfred Carlton Gilbert, a former Olympic pole vaulter who first made a name for himself in the toy industry earlier in the century when he created and manufactured Mysto Magic sets for youthful magicians. Circa 1913, his A. C. Gilbert Company also became the makers of Erector Set metal construction toys, which were &#x27;inspired&#x27; by the English-made Meccano sets of which it was a U.S. distributor. The two toy magnates were just finishing shooting on Gilbert&#x27;s game reserve in New Haven when Gilbert casually mentioned he was thinking about manufacturing toy trains. Instead, Coleman said he&#x27;d give his struggling American Flyer Co. to Gilbert in return for a share of the profits. Gilbert quickly agreed.

Gilbert soon moved the company from Chicago to New Haven, Connecticut, and re-designed parts of the product line. The initial changes included substitution of the &#x27;slot &amp; tab&#x27; couplers with link and pin semi-automatic ones on the higher priced 10&quot; freight cars and steam engine tenders. Three significantly detailed &amp; overall scale length O gauge steam engines were introduced in the 1938 catalog: Atlantic (4-4-2), Pacific (4-6-2-) and an 0-6-0 switcher. The years 1938 through 1941 saw the production of Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Tru Model&quot; 3/16&quot; O gauge trains. The engines offered in this line were fairly accurate scale replicas of the locomotives they were modeled after. A Reading Lines Atlantic, Pennsylvania K5 Pacific, a NYC Hudson, a B&amp;O streamlined steamer (Royal Blue), a UP Northern (4-8-4) and an NKP 0-8-0 Switcher. This line would later become the postwar 3/16&quot; scale or S gauge line with two rail tracks. Also, its HO product line was introduced in the 1938 catalog. The design of the initial version of the HO track was significantly different from that of typical electric trains: the rails were mounted on lithographed roadbed.

Gilbert was not the first American company to offer 3/16&quot; &#x27;S&#x27; scale trains. The Cleveland (Ohio) Model &amp; Supply Company had been offering theirs (known as &quot;C-D&quot;) by &#x27;37. But the smaller scale (1:64) became much more prominent with its introduction in the 1939 catalog, which features World&#x27;s Fair imagery on the yellow, black &amp; white cover. The relatively expensive, heavy and highly detailed engines and cars had had diecast zinc alloy bodies. As were the HO rolling stock, the engines and cars were offered in completely manufactured and kit forms. Additional engines, cars and accessories were added in the 1940 catalog. These included less costly engines with tinplate tenders, and less costly freight and passenger cars, also made of painted tinplated steel. The 3/16 scale trains were designed to run on O gauge track whose curved sections had 20&quot; radii (formed 40&quot; circles). Importantly, the trains featured fully automatic coupling and uncoupling that were functionally comparable to Lionel&#x27;s. Unlike Lionel&#x27;s costly and sophisticated design (each truck contained a solenoid and electrical pickup shoe), the A.F. &#x27;link &amp; pin&#x27; (a.k.a. &#x27;harpoon&#x27;) couplers were gravity based.

Except for updated versions of the 1937 whistling billboard and trackage, all of the products offered in the 1941 catalog had been designed under Gilbert&#x27;s ownership. The &#x27;Chicago&#x27; products had been expunged. The scale accuracy was emphasized in the catalogs and packaging. Already experiencing materials shortages (due to Lend Lease), no new products were introduced in the 1942 catalog, which was only slight different than the previous edition. Prices were printed on an accompanying unstapled sheet but not on the bound pages. Even the set numbers (i.e. 4117) were not changed. The cover of the &#x27;42 edition is distinguished from the &#x27;41 by a caveat about erratic availability printed in small red fonts.

During Summer, 1942 Gilbert (as were many manufacturing companies) was compelled by Federal wartime restrictions to cease manufacturing and servicing its electric train and other metal consumer products. It did not again publish American Flyer catalogs until 1946. The manufacturing hiatus offered the company the opportunity to further differentiate its products from those of the market leaders Marx and Lionel. By Summer, 1945 it was able to resume limited manufacturing of the 3/16s scale O gauge trains. While it did so, the same sized products were re-engineered to run on much more realistic two rail (with a &quot;T&quot; profile rail) track. The fine detail of the diecast engines, tenders and cars that had debuted in the &#x27;39 catalog reappeared. The engines and tenders continued to be made of diecast metal, but the cars&#x27; bodies were made out of plastic. Two pages of the spectacular 1946 catalog emphasize the running advantages of the lighter cars. Ironically, they soon realized that they had to add weight. Metal car bottoms &amp; chassis were necessary to prevent the too-light cars from tipping over. The &#x27;link &amp; pin&#x27; automatic couplers that had been introduced on the 3/16s O products were reduced in size, with plastic replacing the sintered metal of the originals. They too, later had metal weights added because they would fail to descend to the locking position needed for cars to couple. The chugging mechanisms of the premium O gauge tenders were redesigned to also generate smoke, which was conveyed to the engines&#x27; smokestacks via a black rubber tube that protruded out of the rear of the cab so that it could connect to the front of the tender.

Because of the relatively accurate scale of the rolling stock and two rail track, these trains (not yet referred to as &quot;S&quot; gauge by Gilbert) were significantly more realistic than their 3 rail O gauge counterparts.

Gilbert apparently ceased offering O gauge rolling stock by &#x27;47, but did continue to offer O gauge parts.

The product line continued to be refined and expanded. The chugger / smoker was redesigned and moved from the tenders into the engines. The advantages included eliminating the separate motor (power drain and cost) and ensuring precise (geared) synchronicity of the chugging with the rotation of the drive wheels. DC versions of the engines were offered in the 1949 line. Two different engines (the other AC) could be controlled with nominal independence on the same track. Diesels, not offered since 1940 were offered in the 1950 line.

In 1946 Lionel also debuted its post war trains. They too featured smoking but also its ingeniously designed (also solenoid based) and realistic knuckle coupler. With the improved coupler, it also introduced its very realistic sintered metal trucks. In 1952, a few premium sets featured the A.F. version of the knuckle coupler and sintered truck. By the next year, the &#x27;link &amp; pin&#x27; coupler and stamped steel trucks had been discontinued. Gilbert offered conversion kits so that the new couplers could be mounted on the old trucks.

Although popular, American Flyer was always the second-ranked brand to Lionel in terms of market share at the high end of the market. With Louis Marx and Company dominating the low end and a handful of other brands relegated to entry level of the market, Lionel and American Flyer shared premium status. A rivalry emerged between both companies&#x27; fans that continues today.

Gilbert also renewed offering its HO trains shortly after the War, but aside from changing to DC motors and making the cars lighter by using plastic, the products were not updated to conform with the increasingly popular NMRA (National Model Railroad Association) coupler and track standards until 1951. Despite its relatively long experience with HO Gilbert&#x27;s share of that market steadily waned.

Cultural and technical changes, and competing interests (television, the space race, slot cars, etc.), soon relegated indoor larger-than-HO trains to an out-of-date perception. Additionally, the increased prevalence of discount stores ravaged the toy train companies&#x27; traditional distribution network (i.e. mom-and-pop hobby shops, and hardware and department stores). The discount stores demanded train sets at wholesale prices so low that the profit margins of the traditional manufacturers became unsustainable. Additionally, they did not offer the personal attention and repair services of traditional hobby shops. By trying to accommodate the demands of the retail discounters, Gilbert and other toy train manufacturers cheapened their lines. Their &quot;Pikemaster&quot; line exemplified the corruption of the products. This accelerated their downward economic spiral. Longtime train collectors and hobbyists were offended at this newer production, dismissing the new products as &quot;cheap junk&quot;, an accurate description.

These problems were compounded by the death of its founder, A.C. Gilbert in 1961. With the popularity of toy trains and construction toys declining, and without another successful product line to buoy the company&#x27;s finances, Gilbert found itself in serious financial trouble. Finally, a majority of the company was sold by the family to a holding company, the Wrather Group, in 1962 with A.C. Gilbert, Jr., acting as CEO. Within a few months, though, A.C. Jr., died. The company continued to manufacture trains of limited appeal due to the diminished quality.

Under the new ownership, the A.C. Gilbert Co. continued to struggle, although the new owners took a more aggressive approach to advertising and marketing than when the firm was headed by the more conservative A.C. Gilbert. It manufactured a wide variety of poorly designed and poorly conceived toys (dolls, racing sets, games) that sold slowly, if at all, and was nearly overwhelmed by store returns of defective merchandise. Gilbert took an especially hard hit when a majority of a poorly designed and manufactured red James Bond 007 slot car racing set flooded back as returns after component failures. [Because of the number of returns, these sets are rare and very collectible, some selling &quot;pre-crash&#x27; for an average of $1,000 on eBay]. Additionally, the company sold many of its toy line products to discounters with a &quot;100% sale guarantee.&quot; When the merchandise did not sell, it ended up back in Gilbert&#x27;s warehouses. The company discontinued the American Flyer train line in 1966 and was liquidated in 1967.

==Lionel, 1979–present==
In May 1967, Lionel Corporation announced it had purchased the American Flyer name and tooling even though it was teetering on the brink of financial failure itself. A May 29, 1967, story in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; made light of the deal, stating, &quot;Two of the best-known railroads in the nation are merging and the Interstate Commerce Commission couldn&#x27;t care less&quot;. Former Lionel treasurer Robert A. Stein said Lionel did not initiate the deal; both companies had farmed out their accounts receivable departments to Walter Heller &amp; Co., who initiated the transaction. While various accounts published over the years valued the deal at $150,000, Stein&#x27;s recollection was that Lionel simply liquidated $300,000-$400,000 worth of American Flyer inventory for Heller in exchange for the tooling, which, by some accounts, sat unused and neglected in a parking lot for some period of time. Lionel Corporation never manufactured American Flyer trains.

Within two years, Lionel Corp. was bankrupt itself and had sold its train lines to General Mills, including the unused American Flyer tooling. In 1979, General Mills&#x27; Lionel division started to reissue Flyer products under that name employing a mix of previously unused railroad heralds and traditional Gilbert American Flyer designs.

In 1984, General Mills sold the Lionel Co. to Kenner, a toy manufacturer. One year later, the company was sold to Richard Kughn, a Detroit toy train collector who made his fortune selling and developing real estate. For over a decade, Kughn moved both the Lionel and American Flyer brands forward, getting a shot of momentum from a resurgence in the toy train hobby in the early 1990s. In 1996, Kughn sold a majority interest to Wellspring Partners LLD, a Chicago-based national turnaround firm headed by Martin Davis. Kughn retained a small percentage, and rock star Neil Young, another toy train buff, also became a minor investor. Young&#x27;s contributions include designing a sound system for trains (RailSounds) in 1992, as well as the Trainmaster Command Control (TMCC), a unique radio control system. The new company is known as Lionel, LLC.

The American Flyer brand name survives today under the guidance of Lionel, LLC, although Lionel&#x27;s advertising and marketing emphasis seems to remain locked on promoting its own O and O27 gauge product lines. True American Flyer aficionados claim this narrow focus is a conflict of interest and prevents the growth of S Gauge among new train operators. Most of the American Flyer-branded product sold by Lionel, LLC today is reissues of 1950s designs utilizing refurbished old Gilbert tooling, decorated in traditional road names and paint schemes used by Gilbert, as well as an influx of some of today&#x27;s modern railroad heralds. One complaint by longtime American Flyer devotees is that Lionel isn&#x27;t creating Flyer products that appeal to the toy train masses—rather, focusing instead on a small market of Flyer collectors.

However, winds of change are blowing. Each year since 2002 Lionel has increased the number of American Flyer offerings, a sign the demand for 3/16&quot; S gauge is growing. In late 2004, Lionel finally debuted a new steam locomotive—a highly detailed, 2-8-2 Mikado in multiple road names. Utilizing all new tooling and issued under the American Flyer name, the Mike is the first original American Flyer steam locomotive design since the late 1950s. Complete with TMCC (Lionel&#x27;s proprietary wireless remote control technology) and a superb sound chip/system (TrainSounds), the Mikados proved to be a hot seller and their success has led to future similar issues. In late 2006, Lionel began delivering an updated remake of its largest steam locomotive, the famous 4-8-4 Northern, as well as a gray Union Pacific Northern with smoke deflectors (elephant ears); both new versions have digital sounds. Due in late 2006 or early 2007 is a new high-detail Pacific (4-6-2) with both TMCC capability and RailSounds. Additionally, Lionel released, in 2006, the first newly tooled passenger fleet. These heavyweight style cars are neither a refashioning of older Flyer designs nor a repurposing of Lionel 027 rolling stock (as some earlier Lionel/Flyer freight cars had been.) Also in 2007 Lionel started to sell American Flyer track, the popular 19&quot; radius curve remaining unavailable to this day. In 2008, Lionel released an American Flyer Big Boy with TMCC and Railsounds.

The license to manufacture the track had been held by Maury Klein, whose K-Line brand of 0 gauge trains competed against Lionel in the toy train renaissance of the 1980s and ’90s and into the 21st. century. When K-Line fell upon hard times in recent years, it was purchased by Lionel LLC, who then got the Flyer track as well as the tooling for two 0 gauge locomotive designs; the UP Big-Boy and the C&amp;O Allegheny. Both of these engines had been tooled to 1/60th. scale so that 0 gauge operators with small layouts and narrow radius curves would be able to enjoy what would otherwise be behemoth engines. Their closeness to 1/64th. scale, however, made these engines naturals for development into the American Flyer Line, particularly since Lionel already possesses tooling for these locomotives in their 0 scale product lines. After considerable delay the company finally delivered the Big Boy in December 2009. No offering has yet been made as to the Allegheny, though collectors and aficionados hold out hope that a sell-out success with the current offering will stimulate the company to proceed further.

Lionel&#x27;s investment in new tooling is being interpreted among many S-scalers as a sign of commitment by the manufacturer to their market segment, as well as the brand, the gauge, and the hobby in itself.

<text>The Raritan were two groups of Lenape people who lived around the lower Raritan River and the Raritan Bay, in what is now northeastern New Jersey, in the 16th century.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Raritan&quot; likely came from one of the Lenape languages (among the languages in the Algonquian language group), though there are a variety of interpretations as to its meaning. It may derive from &quot;Naraticong&quot; meaning &quot;river beyond the island.&quot; 

&quot;Raritan&quot; is a Dutch pronunciation of &quot;wawitan&quot; or &quot;rarachons&quot;, meaning &quot;forked river&quot; or &quot;stream overflows&quot;.

The first group known as the Raritan was also known as the Sanhicans. A second group, known as the Wiechquaeskecks, Wisquaskecks, Roaton, Raritanghe, and Raritanoos settled the Raritan watershed area after the first departed.

== History ==
===17th century ===

The original Raritans, the Sanhicans, lived along Raritan Bay&#x27;s west shore until 1640s, when attacks from the Delaware River Indians and Dutch settlers drove them inland. 

The Wisquaskecks had lived in what is now Westchester County, New York. After the Sanhicans migrated east, the Wisquaskecks moved into the area by 1649 and then also became known as the Raritans.

The Raritan had early contact with settlers in the colony of New Netherland. Dutch colonist David Pietersz. de Vries described the Raritans as &quot;a nation of savages who live where a little stream [the Raritan River] runs up about five leagues behind Staten Island.&quot; He wrote that Cornelis van Tienhoven took more than one hundred men to the Wisquaskecks to address their theft of pigs and attempt theft of a yacht. Van Theihoven&#x27;s group killed several of the Wisquaskecks and took their chief&#x27;s brother as a hostage. Van Theihoven tortured the prisoner, and the Americans Indians responded to the attack by killing several Dutch settlers. William Kieft, governor of New Netherland, had planned the extermination campaign against them. The attack against the American Indians was a contributing event to the bands&#x27; allying in Kieft&#x27;s War (1643-45) against the settlements of New Netherland.

In 1649, the Wisquaskecks held a peace conference with the Dutch settlers. Pennekeck, a leader from Newark Bay, &quot;said the tribe called Raritanoos, formerly living at Wisquaskeck had no chief, therefore he spoke for them, who would also like to be our friends...&quot; The Sanhicans unsuccessfully tried to contest Pennekeck.

=== 19th century ===
According to &quot;Encyclopedia of New Jersey Indians&quot;, the surviving Raritans sold the last of their lands and moved to the Brotherton Reservation in Burlington County, New Jersey. Their descendants are part of larger Lenape communities including the Stockbridge Munsee Community in Wisconsin, Delaware Tribe of Indians, Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and the Delaware First Nation of the Six Nations of the Grand River in Ontario.

<text>Neil Hamburger is a standup comedian and singer character created and portrayed by Australian-American entertainer Gregg Turkington. Distinguished for his misanthropic jokes and anti-comedy style, Turkington has released a number of albums as Hamburger and has appeared as the character in various films, television shows, and other media. In 2015, the act inspired the feature-length film &quot;Entertainment&quot;, which stars Turkington as a &quot;variant&quot; of the character.

Turkington developed the character in the 1990s and originally envisioned the concept as a &quot;weird recording project&quot;. It originated from a prank call that had appeared on the album &quot;Great Phone Calls Featuring Neil Hamburger&quot; (1992). He followed the LP with three more albums issued on Drag City Records before he began receiving offers to perform as the character for live shows. His albums &quot;Neil Hamburger Sings Country Winners&quot; (2009) and &quot;First of Dismay&quot; (2014) feature original songs and cover versions backed by &quot;The Too Good For Neil Hamburger Band&quot;.

==Style==
Hamburger&#x27;s live act, which is quite different from his many albums, features a barrage of question/answer jokes aimed often at celebrity targets as well as barbs aimed at his ex-wife. The confrontational aspects of his act drew comparisons to Tony Clifton. One of his gags is &quot;Zipper Lips&quot;, in which he asks an audience member a question. If the audience member doesn&#x27;t respond, Hamburger derides them for being a &quot;zipper lips&quot;. A common phrase used by the comedian is &quot;But that&#x27;s my life!&quot;, which he uses when he mentions being humiliated or degraded for some reason.

==Career==

Turkington&#x27;s first Neil Hamburger recordings were self-recorded, imagining an unfunny, poorly recorded self-released stand-up comedy act. Turkington used recordings of audience laughter that were intentionally out of sync with his jokes, to replicate the private pressing albums by outsider artists that he enjoyed. These early recordings found a cult audience, which led to record label Drag City issuing his album &quot;America&#x27;s Funnyman&quot; in 1996. Several more albums were issued on the record label.

After originally conceiving Hamburger to be a studio-only character, Turkington was convinced to perform as the character on stage. His first shows were supporting punk rock band Frenzal Rhomb, who flew Turkington from the United States to Australia especially for the performance. Neil Hamburger would later appear in the music videos for the songs &quot;Ballchef&quot; and &quot;Punisher&quot; from Frenzal Rhomb&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Sans Souci&quot;.
Hamburger was a frequent guest on the Internet talk show &quot;Tom Green&#x27;s House Tonight&quot; (2006–2013). In 2006, Hamburger started doing his own show called &quot;Poolside Chats with Neil Hamburger&quot; on &quot;The Channel&quot; at Tomgreen.com. Guests on his show have included Tim and Eric, Kyle Gass of Tenacious D, Buzz Osborne of the Melvins, and Bonnie &#x27;Prince&#x27; Billy.

In 2006, Hamburger had a brief cameo appearance in the film &quot;Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny&quot;. Over the next year, he opened for Tenacious D during their Pick of Destiny Tour. However, his performances incited mostly negative reactions, with booing and heckling ensuing in countries such as Ireland and England. His performance at Madison Square Garden was referred to by Sia Michel of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as likely &quot;the greatest night of his career.&quot;

In 2008, Drag City released an album of country and western originals and covers recorded by Hamburger. During the sessions, Hamburger was backed by musicians including Prairie Prince of The Tubes and Todd Rundgren&#x27;s band, David Gleason, Atom Ellis of Dieselhed and the New Cars, Rachel Haden from That Dog.

In December 2010, Special Entertainment released an iPhone App called &quot;Shaky Advice from Neil Hamburger&quot; that functions much like a Magic 8 Ball, with 30 video clips of Hamburger giving comical advice.

In 2015, the Neil Hamburger act was dramatized for the Rick Alverson film &quot;Entertainment&quot;. In it, the character is shown repeatedly on and offstage; as well as the life of a fictional portrayal of the man behind the act separate from the real Gregg Turkington. The film&#x27;s script was written by Turkington, Alverson, and comedian Tim Heidecker, although the dialogue was improvised.

In 2021, Neil Hamburger won &quot;Best Guest Host&quot; of Tim Heidecker&#x27;s podcast &quot;Office Hours&quot;.

<text>Louis J. Montulli II (best known as Lou Montulli) is a computer programmer who is well known for his work in producing web browsers. In 1991 and 1992, he co-authored a text web browser called Lynx, with Michael Grobe and Charles Rezac, while he was at the University of Kansas. This web browser was one of the first available and is still in use today.

==Career==
In 1994, he became a founding engineer of Netscape Communications and programmed the networking code for the first versions of the Netscape web browser. He was also responsible for several browser innovations, such as HTTP cookies, the blink element, server push and client pull, HTTP proxying, and encouraging the implementation of animated GIFs into the browser. While at Netscape, he also was a founding member of the HTML working group at the W3C and was a contributing author of the HTML 3.2 specification. He is one of only six inductees in the World Wide Web Hall of Fame announced at the First International Conference on the World-Wide Web in 1994.

In 1998, he became a founding engineer of Epinions which is now a Shopping.com company.

In 2002, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.

In 2004, he became co-founder and CEO of Memory Matrix, which was acquired by Shutterfly Inc. in May 2005. Montulli served as Vice President of Client Engineering at Shutterfly through the summer of 2007.

In 2008, he became co-founder of Zetta.net, a cloud storage company.

==Ongoing projects==
While working on the Netscape browser, Montulli built the Fishcam, one of the earliest live image websites (ie. live as in broadcasting), famously built into early versions of the Netscape browser as the Fishcam Easter egg. The company Netscape hosted this fishcam until long after they were no longer Netscape. After a short hiatus, in 2009 it found a new host; it is still one of the longest (nearly) continuously running live websites.

<text>The American University in Bulgaria (AUBG) is a private university in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria. Established in 1991, AUBG had about 1,000 students from over 40 countries on 5 continents as of Fall 2022. Close to 40% of the students are international.

==History==
Founded in 1991, the American University in Bulgaria is the first American-style, liberal arts undergraduate education institution in Eastern Europe. The university is a cooperative venture established with the support of the U.S. and Bulgarian governments, the Open Society Institute, the City of Blagoevgrad, and the University of Maine.

When it opened its doors in September 1991, AUBG&#x27;s first-year class was 208 students and it had 16 full-time faculty members. Nowadays, it has around 1000 students from over 40 countries.

By May 2019, twenty-four classes of around 5,000 students had graduated from AUBG.

==Funding==
The university has three sources of funding: its endowment (which came largely from gifts from the United States Agency for International Development and the Soros Foundation), gifts, and tuition.

==Accreditation==
Baccalaureate degrees conferred by AUBG are accredited in both Bulgaria and the United States. AUBG is institutionally accredited in the United States from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. The university also issues a European Diploma Supplement (part of Europass), which confers automatic recognition of the AUBG degree throughout Europe.

==Rankings==
For consecutive years, AUBG holds the top position nationally in Business Administration, European Studies, Journalism and Mass Communication, and Political Science and International Relations. The Economics, Computer Science, and Information Systems programs rank second in Bulgaria.
A university survey in 2016 found that sixty-five percent of graduating students received more than one job offer or higher degree program acceptance letter when they applied for work or a higher degree upon completing their studies at AUBG. Approximately 20 percent of graduates earned more than $100,000/year and over 20 percent of alumni from 1995 to 2005 who were currently working in the U.S. earned more than $250,000/year.

==Academics==

The university follows the traditional American-style of education liberal arts. More than 60% of the students graduate from AUBG with two majors or a major and a minor. More than half of graduating seniors complete double majors, while many undergraduates supplement their main field of study with a minor in one of 19 disciplines offered at AUBG.

The university employs about 70 faculty members from over 15 countries.

AUBG students can spend a year or a semester at one of several hundred universities in the United States through the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP). In Europe, AUBG is the holder of a standard Erasmus Charter and has bilateral Erasmus Programme agreements with over 50 institutions.

===Graduate programs===

In addition to its undergraduate programs, the university offers an Executive MBA program in Sofia.

===Non-degree programs===
The university offers a number of training courses. Most of these are held in the AUBG Elieff Center for Education and Culture in Sofia. 
The Blagoevgrad-based English Language Institute offers English-language instruction at all levels and for all ages year-round.

===Tuition and scholarships===
AUBG offers spring and fall semester admission on a rolling basis.

The university offers need- and merit-based aid to deserving students.

The AUBG Tchaprachikoff scholarship provides partial funding for tuition for up to two years for Bulgarian AUBG graduates who are admitted to a graduate program in any one of the top 20 national universities in the United States or to any one of the top 20 U.S. schools in the respective fields.

==Campus==

The Skaptopara campus in Blagoevgrad is home to the university undergraduate programs. It includes three residence halls; Balkanski Academic Center, which houses classrooms, computer labs, and offices; Panitza Library, the largest English-language library in Southeast Europe; and the America for Bulgaria Students center.

The residence halls have aerobic rooms, music practice rooms, multipurpose rooms, billiard and ping pong areas, several television lounges, outside decks, kitchens, and cafes.
The Panitza Library is named for John Dimitry Panitza, a Bulgarian philanthropist and AUBG founder. Through Panitza&#x27;s efforts, the library developed into the largest English-language library in the region.
The Balkanski Academic Center bears the name of physicist Minko Balkanski The center was dedicated to Professor Balkanski and his family in 2010.

==Student life==
AUBG students can join clubs, student media, sports teams, and activities such as theatre, AUBG Choir, debating, Model United Nations simulations, and public service.

===Student government===
Established in 1991, the AUBG Student Government is a directly elected representative body of the students at AUBG. The Student Government holds its sessions weekly. It has a yearly budget, which is allocated among the student clubs and organizations.

===Clubs===

AUBG hosts chapters of international organizations, such as People to People International, AIESEC, the Phi Beta Delta Honor Society, and the Association for Computing Machinery. Social and sports organizations, such as the AUBG Olympics and others like More Honors, Debate Club, Rock Jamming Club, Polygon Club, Business Club and Investment Management Club are also available.

The Better Community Club members work on social projects. Their activities include a multi-year educational project at Blagoevgrad&#x27;s &quot;St. Nikolay Mirlikliyski&quot; orphanage; fundraising campaigns for local centers for people with disabilities and a local family afflicted with serious health problems; and others.

The AUBG Choir was created in 1993 by its director – associate professor of music – Hristo Krotev. The choir has received a number of national and international awards.

The Broadway Performance Club stages musicals for the students and faculty every year. The AUBG community has already seen &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Hairspray&quot;, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;Memphis&quot;, &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, &quot;Burlesque, Catch me If You Can and Hair&quot;. After its performances in Blagoevgrad, the musical goes on a tour around the country.

The Psychology Club aims to spread awareness about mental health on campus, while also organizing events, workshops and guest lectures related to Psychology.

=== Acceleration Program Elevate ===
AUBG launched its first Acceleration Program Elevate in 2019. This helps student entrepreneurs and recent alumni start their first businesses. During the four-month program, teams of two to four AUBGers have access to many workshops, training and a mentorship network of experienced entrepreneurs and AUBG alumni. Each team gets $5000 as capital to kick-start their development. Designed to provide students with startup guidance, the accelerator doubles as a way to support the university: AUBG will have a 5% stake in each company that comes out of the program.

===Student media ===
There are several student media on campus (broadcast, print, and electronic) which chronicle university events and town life, among them student newspaper AUBG Daily, and Bulgaria&#x27;s oldest private radio station Radio AURA.

===Research and innovation===

Students participate in conferences and competitions worldwide, such as the Carroll Round International Student Research conference at Georgetown University, USA and the annual Microsoft&#x27;s Imagine Cup competition. The Goldman Sachs Global Leaders Program has repeatedly recognized AUBG students’ potential. AUBG hosts its own research conference every year, where students and faculty present research projects.

In Fall 2016, the innovation hub “Aspire” opened doors. It encourages AUBG students to create something, whether it is a start-up business, a tech venture or a book. “Aspire” is a shared working space that aims to foster the exchange of ideas among the AUBG community and to facilitate the transformation of creative visions into reality. The hub is a home of many events related to innovation, inventiveness and inspiration.

===Athletics===

Every year, AUBG holds its own Olympic games. In the AUBG Olympics, students compete in sports disciplines, such as long jump, soccer, basketball, volleyball, arm wrestling, tug-of-war, horseshoe throwing, and boxing. The university has its own American football team, the AUBG Griffins. Residence halls host table tennis, billiards, aerobic fitness rooms, and gym facilities. There are sports facilities with a basketball court, a football field, two tennis courts and a volleyball court. Those interested in skiing, hiking, horseback riding, boxing, kickboxing, aerobics, volleyball, baseball, yoga, taekwondo, softball, and karate have formed student clubs and intramural teams. Every semester there are soccer and basketball intramural competitions.

===Lecture series and conferences===

<doc id="432118" wikidata="Q5481760" url="?curid=432118" title="Francis Lovelace">
<text>Francis Lovelace (c. 1621–1675) was an English Royalist and the second Governor of New York colony.

==Early life==
Lovelace was born circa 1621. He was the third son of Sir William Lovelace (1584–1627) and his wife Anne Barne of Lovelace Place, Bethersden and Woolwich, Kent. He was the younger brother of Richard Lovelace, the Cavalier poet. The Bethersden Lovelace lineage was founded in 1367 by John Lovelace, six generations before Francis, and has been confused over the years with the Hurley Lovelaces who were raised to the House of Lords.

==Career==
The five Lovelace brothers supported Charles I in the English Civil War. Francis was a Colonel in the Royalist army and was governor of Carmarthen Castle in Wales from June 1644 until it was surrendered to Parliamentary troops in October 1645 after a fierce battle in which his brother, William, was killed. He and another brother, Dudley, migrated to Europe and served with the French army later in the 1640s. The brothers later supported Charles II, and spent time in exile like him, in his fight to be restored to the throne.

Lovelace lived in Virginia where his sister, Anne Gorsuch, had migrated after marriage, from 1650 until after the colony was seized by the English Parliamentary commissioners in 1652 when the governor, Sir William Berkeley, dispatched him to France to inform Charles II. Though he is referred to in the administration entry as a bachelor, he is known to have married one Blanche Talbot secretly at the age of 38 and was &quot;later forced or persuaded to leave his wife&quot;. He returned to England in 1658, the year of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s death. In 1659, he was arrested and confined in the Tower of London until after the fall of the Parliamentary government and the restoration of Charles II in 1660.

Charles gave his brother, the Duke of York (later to become King James II), rights to the colony of Nieuw Amsterdam when Richard Nicolls took it from the Dutch in 1667. Many English colonists did not like Nicolls because they thought Oliver Cromwell had been their savior.

===Governor of New York===
The Duke of York appointed Lovelace the second governor of the New York Colony in 1668 after the departure of Richard Nicolls. While in office he purchased Staten Island from the local Native Americans, among whom he sent Church of England missionaries, granted &#x27;freedom of conscience&#x27; to the English, Dutch and Swedish populations of the colony, organised infantry and militia companies and expanded New York City&#x27;s defences. During his time in NY, he ran and operated the King&#x27;s House tavern (also known as Lovelace Tavern) in lower Manhattan. The tavern was built in 1670 in the Stadt Huys Block and rediscovered by archeologists in 1979–1980.

Despite his defensive preparations, his administration was terminated by the temporary recapture of the colony by the Dutch in 1673 when, for a brief period the Dutch Admiral Cornelis Evertsen the youngest seized New York City, to little opposition, and re-established Nieuw Amsterdam. At the time of the invasion, Lovelace was out of the colony, meeting with the Governor of Connecticut, John Winthrop Jr. in Hartford, Connecticut, in the course of planning the first postal system from New York to Boston. From 1673 to 1674, Dutch marine Captain Anthony Colve acted as military governor-general until England recovered the colony under the terms of the Treaty of Westminster in 1674.

===Return to England===
Lovelace, whose property in New York had been confiscated by the Dutch, was sent home in disgrace to England. The Duke of York, blaming Lovelace for the loss of his namesake colony, confiscated his plantation on Staten Island and his English estates for a £7,000 debt. In January 1675 he was committed to the Tower of London, where he was interrogated by commissioners. His answers were deemed unacceptable, but no further proceedings were brought against him. He contracted dropsy and, because of his health, was released in April. He went to live at Woodstock, Oxfordshire and died, in penury, by 22 December 1675 when administration of his estate was granted to his brother Dudley.

The third new Governor of New York after Francis Lovelace was John Lovelace, 4th Baron Lovelace of Hurley – no kin to Francis of the Bethersden Lovelaces. Early genealogists confused Francis with an identically named son of Richard Lovelace, 1st Baron Lovelace of Hurley, due to a pamphlet issued at the time of his appointment mistakenly asserting that he was the brother of the said Richard. The confusion has also spread to more modern historians.

<text>Victor Gazaway Willis (April 12, 1876 – August 3, 1947) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. He played for the Boston Beaneaters, Pittsburgh Pirates, and St. Louis Cardinals in 13 seasons in the National League (NL) from 1898 to 1910. In 513 career games, Willis pitched 3,996 innings and posted a win–loss record of 249–205, with 388 complete games, 50 shutouts, and a 2.63 earned run average (ERA). Nicknamed &quot;the Delaware Peach&quot;, he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1995.

==Early life==
Willis was born on April 12, 1876, in Cecil County, Maryland. He moved to Newark, Delaware, as a young boy, where he attended school. He attended high school at Newark Academy and played both on the high school baseball team and in semi-pro baseball leagues throughout Delaware. Prior to joining the major leagues, Willis played football and baseball for the University of Delaware, then known as Delaware College, despite never attending the college. This was due to their low enrollment at the time, which allowed them to add local talent to fill out their roster.

Willis began his professional baseball career in 1895 with the Harrisburg Senators of the Pennsylvania State League. After the team ceased operations in June, he moved to the Lynchburg Hill Climbers of the Virginia State League. The following year, he was promoted to the Syracuse Stars of the Eastern League. He finished the season with a 10–6 win–loss record, but had spent most of the season battling illness, which caused him to end his season in July. Willis returned to the Stars for the 1897 season and, after establishing a curveball in the offseason, finished the season with 21 wins, with Syracuse winning the league championship in the process. After the season ended, he was purchased by the Boston Beaneaters for Fred Lake and $1,000. The Beaneaters acquired Willis to fill the void left by Jack Stivetts, who was near retirement due to an arm injury.

==Major League Baseball career==
Willis began his major league career with the Beaneaters on April 20, 1898, in a relief appearance against the Baltimore Orioles, allowing eight runs, three walks, and a wild pitch in an 18–2 loss while also hitting two batters. In his next appearance, he beat the Washington Senators, 11–4, in his first career start. He remained in the starting rotation throughout the season but at times struggled with his control. In one game against the Philadelphia Phillies, opposing pitcher Red Donahue threw a no-hitter, while Willis allowed eight walks in a 5–0 loss. He finished the season with 25 wins, 13 losses, a 2.84 ERA, 148 walks, and 160 strikeouts. He finished second in walks and third in strikeouts in the National League. In 1899, Willis became the last pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the 19th century.

Despite being a Hall of Fame pitcher, Willis holds the post-1900 single season records for most losses (29) and most complete game losses (25); both records were set in 1905. For the three seasons from 1903 to 1905, Willis compiled a dismal record with the Beaneaters of 42 wins against 72 losses. However, his earned run average during those three years averaged 3.02, and in two of those years his ERA was under 3.00. Despite Willis&#x27; performance on the mound during those three seasons, the Boston offense could only muster a combined .238 batting average over those seasons. When he changed teams to the Pittsburgh Pirates for 1906, whose offense had a combined batting average of .256 over the four years Willis was with the team, he compiled a record of 88–46. His ERA for those four years was 2.08.

Willis was on one World Series championship team, the 1909 Pirates. He lost one game during the Series pitching against Ty Cobb&#x27;s Detroit Tigers. Willis&#x27; final major league season was 1910, with the St. Louis Cardinals. The following season, he pitched for a semipro team in his hometown of Newark, Delaware.

==Later life==
After retiring from baseball, Willis purchased and operated the Washington House, a hotel in Newark, Delaware. Willis died in 1947 and is interred in St. John Cemetery in Newark.

In 1977 he was inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame. The National Baseball Hall of Fame inducted him in 1995.

<doc id="432126" wikidata="Q4682925" url="?curid=432126" title="Adios (horse)">
<text>Adios (January 3, 1940 – June 22, 1965) was a champion harness racing sire.
The son of Hal Dale and the mare Adioo Volo, the horse named Adios was born on January 3, 1940, at Two Gaits Farm, in Carmel, Indiana. Trained and driven by Frank Ervin and for a while owned by Harry Warner of Warner Bros. film studio, Adios was a multiple world champion during his racing career. His pacing record at the Shelbyville, Indiana, fair stood for 43 years. Despite his racing success, he is most famous for his offspring, which included Adios Harry.

In 1948 Adios was bought by harness racing driver, Delvin Miller, to stand in stud at his Meadow Lands farm near Washington, Pennsylvania. The horse proved to be a tremendous stud, considered by many to be the greatest in harness racing history. He sired eight Little Brown Jug winners, more than any other horse, and his sons, Adios Butler and Bret Hanover both became winners of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. Adios sired 589 offspring in total.

Adios died on June 22, 1965. The horse was buried at Meadow Lands farm under his favorite apple tree near the paddock that had been his home for seventeen years.

His name is synonymous with horse racing and can be found on consumer products and harness horse equipment.

A race was named for him, held each year on the second Saturday in August at The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in Meadow Lands, Pennsylvania. Since the first Delvin Miller Adios in 1967, it has evolved into one of the important events in the harness racing season.

Adios Golf Club in Coconut Creek, Florida, was named after the horse by his owner and club founder Delvin Miller. The course was designed in 1982 by fellow founder Arnold Palmer.

Two Gaits Farm in Carmel, Indiana, where Adios was foaled, was purchased in 2011 by Jeffrey and Beth Weisgerber. Adios Pass, a nearby street, is named after the sulky champion.

<text>Winton is an outback town and locality in the Shire of Winton in Central West Queensland, Australia. It is northwest of Longreach. The main industries of the area are sheep and cattle raising. The town was named in 1876 by postmaster Robert Allen, after his place of birth, Winton, Dorset. Winton was the first home of the airline Qantas. In the , the locality of Winton had a population of 856 people.

==History==
===Traditional owners===
The traditional owners of the Winton area, the Koa people, consider Bladensburg National Park area (near Winton) to be a special part of their traditional country, and the park is also important to the Maiawali and Karuwali people.

Jirandali (also known as Yirandali, Warungu, Yirandhali) is an Australian Aboriginal language of North-West Queensland, particularly the Hughenden area. The language region includes the local government area of the Shire of Flinders, including Dutton River, Flinders River, Mount Sturgeon, Caledonia, Richmond, Corfield, Winton, Torrens, Tower Hill, Landsborough Creek, Lammermoor Station, Hughenden, and Tangorin.

Skull Hole, on Surprise Creek, at Bladensburg Station about from Winton, was the site of a massacre of Aboriginal people in 1877.

The Koa people have lodged an application to the Federal Court to have their native title legally recognised. This application (or &quot;claim&quot;) was registered on 28 September 2015, by the National Native Title Tribunal.

===Early exploration===
In one of Australia&#x27;s greatest mysteries, the Prussian explorer Ludwig Leichhardt set off on an expedition with a group of men and animals from the Condamine River in the Darling Downs, bound for the Swan River Colony across the continent. He was last seen on 3 April 1848 at McPherson&#x27;s Station, Coogoon, still on the Darling Downs. His whereabouts thereafter have never been known, but he and his men are believed to have met their end in the Great Sandy Desert. This expedition may have brought Leichhardt near Winton&#x27;s future site.

William Landsborough undertook extensive exploration of both the Western and Diamantina rivers in the 1860s, and it seems likely that he might have found himself at Winton&#x27;s future site at least once, for it lies on the former. In 1866, Landsborough led another expedition up the Diamantina, which would have taken him to within 60 km of the actual site, albeit not right to it.

The first European settlers in the area came in 1866, but many did not stay very long because a drought struck within a few years. The town&#x27;s true birth came with a sequence of events, both natural and manmade, which gave rise to one new town in Central West Queensland, but also sowed the seeds for another&#x27;s failure.

===Winton&#x27;s founding and early days===
Robert Allen, a former police sergeant, left Aramac about 1875 and moved west to the Pelican Waterholes (about west of the town&#x27;s current site), where he set up a shop and a public house the next year. The heavy rains that same year, however, brought Allen a great deal of woe, and he even &quot;was compelled by floods to remain two days on the wall-plate of his building.&quot; When the flooding had abated somewhat, Allen shifted what was left of his business to Winton&#x27;s current site. Robert Allen is thus held to be the town&#x27;s founder.

Winton&#x27;s entrenchment as this pioneering region&#x27;s business hub was secured only by a quirk of fate, as William Henry Corfield&#x27;s written record makes clear. He and some acquaintances set out to do business in an Outback town that had been surveyed and laid out by the Queensland colonial government, only to decide upon arrival in the district that it would be a better idea to found a town somewhat further east near the Pelican Waterholes, which was to become Winton. William Henry Corfield (1843–1927), later the mayor of Winton, had returned to Queensland in 1878 after suffering a bout of malaria, and wrote of his experiences as a pioneer in Central West Queensland in his book &quot;Reminiscences of Queensland 1862–1899&quot;, published in 1921:
Passing through Townsville, I met [Robert] Fitzmaurice, who told me that carrying had fallen away between Cooktown and the Palmer, and that he had left that district. He suggested that I should join with him in carrying to the western country, and added that he had been informed by a squatter that there was a good opening for a store at the Conn Waterhole, on the Diamantina River. This is about forty miles [60 km] down the Western River from where Winton now is.
The Conn Waterhole to which Corfield referred is a body of water some down the Western River from Winton. It is the northernmost permanent waterhole in the Diamantina basin, and maps still identify it by that name today. Corfield made it clear where he meant to settle:
Our destination was Collingwood, more widely known as the Conn Waterhole, where the Government Surveyor had laid out a township situated about west of Winton.
Another man of Corfield&#x27;s acquaintance, named Thomas Lynett, had left Townsville for the same destination with backing from Burns, Philp and Co. to set up a shop at Collingwood, if he deemed the newly laid out town to be suitable upon his inspection. Apparently, though, he did not, deciding that the land there was too prone to flooding. He turned back, and eventually, he, Corfield, Fitzmaurice and Robert Allen, who was already at the more easterly site, agreed to establish a centre east of Corfield&#x27;s original destination of Collingwood. This was Winton&#x27;s beginning. Collingwood, however, whose site was the government&#x27;s choice, never truly took root, and by 1900, it was a ghost town.

At the Winton site, Corfield, Fitzmaurice, Lynett and Allen then discussed moving Allen&#x27;s building northwards somewhat, back from the Western River on higher ground. Corfield wrote about the outcome:
We offered to do the work without cost, but Allen and Lynett decided to remain where they were. We had to accept the position, and agreed to build in line with the others.

This formed the base upon which Mr. Surveyor Jopp laid out the township afterwards.
&quot;Mr. Surveyor Jopp&quot; was George Keith Jopp, a surveyor based in Blackall. His name was to be found on the &quot;List of Surveyors licensed to act under the provisions and for the purposes of &#x27;The Real Property Acts of 1861 and 1877&#x27;&quot;, which was published in &quot;Wright&#x27;s Australian and American Commercial Directory and Gazetteer&quot; in 1881. Corfield&#x27;s book also tells the locally well known story of how Winton got its current name:
The original name for the town – now known as Winton – was Pelican Water-holes. Bob Allen, the first resident, whom I have mentioned, acted as post-master. The mail service was a fortnightly one, going west to Wokingham Creek, thence &quot;via&quot; Sesbania to Hughenden. There was no date stamp supplied to the office, but by writing &quot;Pelican Water-holes&quot; and the date across the stamps, the post mark was made, and the stamps cancelled. This was found to be very slow and unsatisfactory.

Allen was asked to propose a name, and he suggested that the P.O. should be called &quot;Winton.&quot; This is the name of a suburb of Bournemouth, Hampshire, England, and Allen&#x27;s native place.
Even though Bournemouth is nowadays generally held to be in Dorset, Corfield did not quite get the county wrong. Bournemouth is actually in the ceremonial county of Dorset, but Corfield named the historic county of Hampshire, which also includes Bournemouth. It is clear, however, that Corfield correctly identified Allen&#x27;s birthplace.

Business in those earliest days of the town&#x27;s existence was hindered by the lack of a local bank. The nearest one was in Aramac, some away. There was also a drought then. Building materials had to be brought in from even farther away, for there was not a great deal of wood to be had in the Channel Country. Corfield travelled all the way to Townsville on Queensland&#x27;s east coast to fetch them in. Law enforcement was also as non-existent as one might expect it to be in an early town in Central West Queensland. Corfield described that problem, too:
At this time Winton was the rendezvous of some of the worst characters of the west; fights were frequent on the then unformed streets.

The rowdies threatened to take the grog in the store, and as there were no police nearer than Aramac, I deemed it best to dispose of all the liquor to Allen, the local publican, who jumped at the chance to obtain a supply.

A few residents formed themselves into a vigilance committee.

The late Mr. J. A. Macartney passed through to visit his property, Bladensburg Station, and seeing how things were, wrote to the Home Secretary asking for police protection.
He also described another problem – drug abuse:
When I returned Winton was entirely out of liquor, and Allen did a great business in selling bottles of painkiller as a substitute. It was laughable to see men take a bottle out of their pocket, saying, &quot;Have a nip, mate, it&#x27;s only five shillings a bottle?&quot;
Winton was gazetted as a township on 12 July 1879, describing it as resumed from the Doveridge No. 4 and Vindex No. 1 North runs.

The North Gregory Hotel was established in 1879. In 1899 it burnt down for the first time, but a new North Gregory Hotel was up and running by the following 1900.

In 1879, Julius von Berger, who had fled Schleswig-Holstein to escape Prussian rule, became the town&#x27;s first dispensing chemist (pharmacist).

In 1880, Sub-Inspector Fred Murray and Sergeant Feltham came to town from Blackall and set up Winton&#x27;s first police station in a small rented building. Their equipment was rather primitive, though, and they had to make do with a hefty log and a chain as a police lockup. This was not always good enough:
One day Feltham went down to the store, leaving a prisoner chained up. Shortly afterwards he was surprised when he saw his prisoner (who was a very powerful man) marching into the public house carrying the log on his shoulder, and call for drinks. It took three men to get him back to the lock-up.
Cobb &amp; Co&#x27;s stagecoaches were serving Winton by 1880 after having bought up a number of mail routes in Queensland. Robert Arthur Johnstone also arrived in Winton in 1880 to become the town&#x27;s first police magistrate. He had been in the Australian native police and had been an associate of George Elphinstone Dalrymple in the latter&#x27;s exploratory work. In 1880 Johnstone also conducted the first sale of government land, one result of which was the acquisition of Thomas Lynett&#x27;s property by the Queensland National Bank, thus giving Winton its first bank. The bank began business right away in Lynett&#x27;s old coffee room, and pulled down his building to make way for something that would be more suitable for a bank. A man named Morgan started a blacksmith&#x27;s shop in Winton after having worked at Ayrshire Downs Station.

In 1881, Thomas McIlwraith, who was then Premier of Queensland and who would be knighted the following year, passed through Winton. His destination was Ayrshire Downs. Nevertheless, the town&#x27;s whole population turned out, at night, at a waterhole almost from town to meet him and his wife.

In 1882, a visiting clergyman, the first of any denomination, visited Winton. On the Sunday while he was in town, he held a church service in the billiard room at the hotel, after a blue blanket had been thrown over the pool table and a red one had been draped over the cue rack. William Corfield himself was later chosen to present the clergyman with remuneration in the form of &quot;a purse of sovereigns&quot;. This presentation did not go off without incident, however. One local squatter caused himself quite a bit of pain – and the other men at the presentation quite a bit of laughter – when, during a prayer upon presentation of the gift, he knelt down in prayer only to wound his rear end with his own long-necked spurs. The clergyman, however, simply carried on with his prayer of thanks.

In 1883, Winton&#x27;s first district court was opened when Judge Miller and Crown Prosecutor Real came to town. By about this time, there was also a doctor in town, who sometimes had to deal with typhoid fever patients. Tenders were sought for building a hospital in Winton late in 1882. It seems, however, that the doctor tendered his resignation only three years later. A correspondent reported not long thereafter &quot;Doctor Van Someron is to be our new surgeon, and I trust that we shall be able to keep him longer with us than his predecessors.&quot; This suggests that Winton was not considered a choice location in the 1880s, at least not among those of the medical profession.

By 1883, Winton was developing into a proper town with economic activity that was of benefit to all the settlers, both urban and rural, in the region. This would have struck most at the time as a great boon, but in William Corfield&#x27;s wry assessment of Winton&#x27;s progress:
&quot;Now that we had two banks, four hotels, a chemist, saddler, besides other branches of industry, we felt that we were being drawn perilously within the influences of civilisation and its drawbacks.&quot;
By 1884, Winton and much of the surrounding area were in the grip of a serious drought that brought many people hardship. It had, however, ended by 1886. By this time, Winton had a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Winton Herald&quot;. It was owned by D. H. Maxwell, who had founded it in 1885 after coming from Aramac. Maxwell later died in an angling accident near Winton in 1894. He was found drowned from town.

A school was being discussed in Winton by a school committee in 1885. Winton State School opened on 10 August 1885, despite the correspondent&#x27;s misgivings about the bureaucracy involved.

&quot;Pugh’s Queensland Almanac, Law Calendar, Directory, and Coast Guide&quot; for 1885 listed Winton&#x27;s local professionals, including Julius von Berger, who was now joined by another pharmacist named A. Hurworth. The hospital&#x27;s surgeon (also described in the almanac as the &quot;Medical Man&quot;) was Dr. Wilson. The name Morgan by this time no longer figured among the town&#x27;s blacksmiths (&quot;J. Long, Ryan &amp; Jensen&quot;). T. B. Feltham had two mentions in the almanac for being both the bookseller-stationer and the tobacconist, and likewise founding townsman Thomas Lynett was listed twice for being both a shopkeeper and the innkeeper at the Royal Mail Hotel. The North Gregory Hotel was run by William Brown Steele by this time. He had bought it from William Henry Corfield after Corfield had bought his partner Robert Fitzmaurice&#x27;s share of that business out after Fitzmaurice had returned from a six-month trip to Sydney to see about his failing eyesight. The prognosis was not good – Fitzmaurice was almost blind when he returned to Winton – and so he decided to sell up and leave town. Corfield, though, had no great interest in running a hotel and so sought out a buyer, and this turned out to be Steele.

In 1886, luxuriant grass growth furnished fodder not only for livestock, but annoyingly also for wildfires. Several nearby stations were stricken, among them Vindex, Elderslie and Ayrshire Downs. Plans were being made to build a Catholic church in 1888. Against this was the state in which the Church of England in Winton then found itself. By 1890, its services were still being held in an all-purpose hall whose owner, William Steele, had the licence for it revoked that year, which was understandably an unwelcome hardship for the town&#x27;s Anglicans.

In 1889, work was in progress on Winton&#x27;s first artesian bore. By mid-August, it had reached a depth of about 430 feet (or 131 m). Tenders were called that same year for another bank, this time the Bank of New South Wales. The same article mentioned that founding townsman Thomas Lynett had had to pay a fine of £1, along with 9s in costs (after having been summoned before the Police Magistrate), for a breach of the Licensing Act.
St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church was built in 1887. The timber church was designed by Rooney Brothers.
In 1890, a local correspondent sang the praises of Winton&#x27;s hospital and was clearly pleased at the staff there. &quot;Winton is at last blessed with a good doctor&quot;, he declared.

===Industrial unrest===
It was also in 1890 that trouble was brewing in Winton, and indeed in other parts of Australia. One report mentioned a robbery in which one man was relieved of £30 while the police seemed unable to catch the thief, and the correspondent commented &quot;This game has been going on here for a very long time&quot;, perhaps meaning to suggest police complicity in this and other crimes. More seriously, even though there was no real loss, was this incident, mentioned in the same report:
Somebody amused himself at the expense of the senior-constable of police, telling him that the shearers and all union men would rush the town. The senior-constable rushed away in hot haste to the barracks, and ordered the police to get Martinis and revolvers in good going order, so as to shoot the unionists down.
The tensions between the shearers and their employers would soon come to a head, and this incident showed just how tense the situation had already become in Winton. Meanwhile, there was Ashton&#x27;s Circus to enjoy. It came to this far-flung town in September 1890 and besides its regular performances, also did a benefit for the local hospital.

The Great Shearers&#x27; Strike came in 1891, disrupting the wool industry for a while. Locally, work stoppages began very early that year. On 6 January 1891, a small item – the quotation below is the article&#x27;s full text – in &quot;The Australian Star&quot; (Sydney) announced the onset of management-labour troubles in the Winton area:
The station hands have left Vindex and Oondooroo stations in the Winton districts in consequence of the new wages tariff formulated by the Pastoral Employers&#x27; Association.
Vindex lies not far east-southeast of Winton, and Oondooroo not far north. One of the &quot;momentous decisions by the Federated Pastoralists&quot; (the management side in the strike) on 18 March 1891 was to declare a great number of stations in the Winton area &quot;non-union&quot;, including Elderslie west of town, and also Ayrshire Downs on Wokingham Creek, Dagworth on the Diamantina River, Warnambool Downs south-southwest of town and Llanrheidol north of Middleton, about 150 km west of Winton. &quot;This means that no loading consigned to those stations during this week will be allowed to be forwarded by union teams&quot;, the article asserted. Later, on nearby Elderslie Station, which belonged to absentee landlord Sir Samuel Wilson at the time, the woolshed was burnt down on 8 October that year.

A major sticking point in the 1891 strike throughout Queensland, and locally in Winton, was the issue of &quot;freedom of contract&quot;. This would have empowered both pastoralists and the shearers whom they employed to enter into contractual employment arrangements free of any union involvement therein. This clearly did not sit well with the striking, unionized shearers. Polls held in striker camps throughout the colony yielded results that were heavily – sometimes unanimously – in favour of rejecting any such arrangement. The camp at Winton wired in to the union headquarters at Barcaldine not only the results of their poll, but also the comment &quot;our decision is to fight to the last.&quot;

Nevertheless, the strikers eventually lost the battle by May 1891. However, management-labour troubles were soon to flare up again.

In 1894, Winton once again found itself in the middle of a hotbed of discontent as the Second Shearers&#x27; Strike wore on. There were unfortunate incidents in the Winton area. At nearby Elderslie Station, a great haystack was set ablaze, while over at Dagworth Station, the shearing shed was burnt down by strikers armed with guns. Another woolshed was set afire at Manuka, about halfway between Winton and Hughenden. A map at the same source shows the &quot;Scene of Recent Outrages&quot; (the strikers did not have the press on their side), with Winton clearly marked. As in the last great strike, Winton hosted a strikers&#x27; camp, and its occupants were as adamant as before. After discussing &quot;the telegram from Longreach declaring the strike off in that district&quot;, the men apparently expressed &quot;a determination to continue the fight to the bitter end.&quot;
The next year – on 6 April 1895 to be precise – Sir Herbert Ramsay gave &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; its first public recital at the North Gregory Hotel in Winton. It was also in 1895 that Premier Sir Hugh Nelson visited Winton. William Henry Corfield, by now the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Gregory, accompanied the premier&#x27;s party on the Winton stretch of his tour. A deputation at Winton was most anxious to let the premier know that a railway link with Hughenden was uppermost in the townsfolk&#x27;s minds, and Mr. Corfield also presented Sir Hugh with a petition, signed by 376 constituents, asking &quot;that a permanent survey of the line from Hughenden to Winton be made with a view of connecting the town with its natural port, Townsville.&quot;

Despite frequent complaints in 19th-century Winton about the dearth of water, an 1895 article mentions that gardeners were growing peaches, grapes and melons in town. Perhaps coincidentally, a famous botanist passed through Winton that year, Frederick Manson Bailey.

Drought was indeed a serious problem in the region at various times, one that might have destroyed Winton, had one drought in 1895 been as dire an emergency as one geologist believed. Robert Logan Jack, FGS, FRGS, a Government Geologist for Queensland, wrote in that year of an eventuality in his Geological Survey, Bulletin no. 1, &quot;Artesian Water in the Western Interior of Queensland&quot;, that might have had not only this effect, but also the effect of saving the doomed town of Collingwood from what would turn out to be its actual fate. The drought striking the region had seriously depleted the waterhole on Mistake Creek, upon which Winton wholly depended for its water, leaving, Jack reckoned, only three weeks&#x27; to a month&#x27;s supply of water for the town. He foresaw that it might become necessary to move Winton&#x27;s whole population, along with their livestock, to the Conn Waterhole at Collingwood, 55 km to the west. This, however, never came about. Moreover, Winton&#x27;s artesian bore was finally completed the next year, ending dependency on the climatic vagaries to which the region is subject, but only after two boring companies had been bankrupted by the project.

The Winton branch railway from Hughenden reached Winton in 1899 (which was likely the last nail in Collingwood&#x27;s coffin).

Winton&#x27;s artesian bore water was being piped from the wellhead in 1902, with water welling up from a depth of 4,010 feet (1 222 m) at the rate of 650,000 imperial gallons (roughly 3 000 000 L) daily. In 1899 and 1900, the town, and indeed the whole region, were suffering under a devastating drought. A correspondent, writing in January 1900 – midsummer – described horrendous conditions on the surrounding stations, some of which were deserted for want of water, others empty of livestock because their owners had had the animals sent out, and yet others that were heaped with dead livestock that had died of thirst. The animals in town were visibly suffering, too. &quot;I could mention many more drought incidents&quot;, the correspondent said, &quot;but it is sickening to write of them.&quot; The correspondent further wrote of the progress of artesian bores at the surrounding stations in some detail, summing it up with the possibly punning remark &quot;This about completes the boring news for the week.&quot; There was a slight respite by July – midwinter – which even saw some livestock sent back to their stations. However, the drought persisted throughout 1900 and affected most of Queensland, with a reporter in Maryborough noting on 29 December that year – well into the next summer – that it &quot;in most places has been the worst experienced in the last 25 years.&quot; He also said, &quot;The closing days of the year, however, have refreshed the parched lands with welcome rains and inspired the hope that the drought is at last broken up, and that a genial season is awaiting us in the new year.&quot;

The town&#x27;s Anglicans celebrated the opening of Saint Paul&#x27;s Church on 4 February 1900.

Even before the end of the 19th century, the town&#x27;s ethnic makeup consisted of more than members of groups from the British Isles. Besides the chemist from Schleswig-Holstein, Julius von Berger, there were people of Chinese origin in Winton, too. In 1896, a firm called Sun Kum Wah in Winton run by three Chinese men, Low Sow, Ah Shew and Sun Kum Fung, placed a notice in Queensland newspapers announcing the dissolution of this three-way partnership, and the apparent formation of a new, two-way one, without Sun Kum Fung. The company, however, kept its former name for at least ten more years, for the building in the flood photograph below is its place of business, with the name painted on the façade. In Robert Logan Jack&#x27;s and Robert Etheridge&#x27;s &quot;Geology and Palæontology of Queensland and New Guinea&quot;, a further reference is made to a Winton man named G. Cramieri, suggesting that there might have been at least one Italian family in Winton in 1892, when the book was published. Mr. Cramieri is mentioned alongside Julius von Berger (who apparently took an interest in palaeontology when he was not working as a pharmacist) as a contributor of fossils whose provenance Jack and Etheridge wished to acknowledge.

===Early 20th century===
The Federation of Australia occurred on 1 January 1901.

St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic School was opened on 1906 by the Sisters of Mercy. Initially the school was conducted inside the wooden church until a separate school building was built in 1911. In 1960 a new school was built and the convent was used to accommodate boarding students. The school came under lay leadership in 1985 with the appointment of Glen Perkins.
Quite at odds with the usual weather complaint was what happened in Winton in 1906, for the problem then was not a dearth of rain, but a definite oversupply. In March of that year, a mailman returning to Longreach from Winton reported &quot;very heavy rain&quot; that week. The rainfall in the area between those two places in the first two months of 1906 was reckoned to be between 14 and 18 inches (roughly 356 to 457 mm) with consequent overflowing seen in the area&#x27;s creeks and rivers. The Western was far from an exception to this, and the photograph at right shows what became of some of the town&#x27;s buildings.

In 1909, the telephone reached Winton and by October, it had 34 subscribers. By May 1911, improvements were being made to the post office to set the telephone exchange apart in its own section because it was becoming a &quot;large and important branch&quot;. Indeed, there were then also plans to expand the exchange with the addition of a further switchboard to handle an expected 50 more subscribers.

Winton Methodist Church opened circa March 1912. It was built from timber at a cost of £540 and could seat 160 people. Later the building was used by the Winton Christian Fellowship.

On Sunday 16 August 1914, Winton&#x27;s townsfolk met at the Shire Hall to form a patriotic committee to recruit volunteers for the military to go and fight in the First World War, which had broken out less than three weeks earlier. Five hundred and eighteen men and women from Winton and the surrounding district served in that war, and their fallen comrades&#x27; names can now be found on Winton&#x27;s war memorial on Vindex Street, outside the Shire Hall. Winton&#x27;s contribution of personnel to the war effort was proportionally one of Australia&#x27;s highest, and 101 of its townsmen fell in the Great War, including a farmhand from nearby Bladensburg Station named Colin Morgan-Reade, who fell at Gallipoli on 30 May 1915. His story served as a focus during Winton&#x27;s observance of the centenary of that campaign in 2015.

In 1916, the North Gregory Hotel burnt down for the second time.

===Between the World Wars===
In 1918, the Royal opened, and is still in business today. It is an outdoor cinema, one of only a few left in Australia.

In 1920, a new company was founded, Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited (now known as Qantas Airways), and for a while, it was headquartered in Winton.

In 1925, St Paul&#x27;s Anglican church burned down. A new St Paul&#x27;s church waswas designed by Atkinson Powell &amp; Conrad and built from timber in 1927.

In 1927, Winton got electricity. This &quot;electric light scheme became an accomplished fact&quot; in January of that year, and by December, it had some 160 subscribers. As a business, it was only breaking even, and so it was hoped that there would be more subscribers in the New Year. The project&#x27;s initial cost was £12,000.

The Prime Minister also came to visit that year. On 2 August 1927, Mr. Stanley Bruce and his wife landed on a flight from Longreach in Winton. The town&#x27;s chamber of commerce was ready with a deputation, who wished to discuss &quot;health, railway communication links, and the export of stud sheep&quot; with the Prime Minister, thus reflecting the day&#x27;s issues of local concern. The deputation especially protested the stud sheep exports to Africa. Mr. Bruce told the deputation that his Ministry would not consider banning this practice unless the pastoral industry itself requested such action. To that end, he suggested that the deputation raise the issue with the pastoralists themselves. The Prime Minister left later that day for Hughenden, after having spent less than three hours in Winton.

On 27 February 1928, a famous Australian pioneer aviator, Bert Hinkler, touched down at Winton on his way from Camooweal to Longreach; he also made intermediate stops at Cloncurry and McKinlay.

Also in 1928, the Central Western railway line reached Winton from Longreach. This was the second railway to reach Winton after the line from Hughenden reached town in 1899. The newer line was hailed by one newspaper with the assertion that &quot;It will allow capital that has been lying idle to become revenue producing, it will provide facilities for the transfer of rolling stock, it will provide quicker touch with markets and reduce transport costs, and it will insure the graziers and the State against the probable loss of millions of sheep in drought time.&quot;

Despite that reporter&#x27;s rosy assessment of the boon that the new railway would be to Winton&#x27;s economy, the 1930s brought Winton&#x27;s wool industry hard times. A meeting of the local branch of the Graziers&#x27; Association of Central and Northern Queensland in 1938 wanted to make known to the general public that for roughly a decade by that time, the revenue brought on the market by wool was outstripped by the production cost, thus incurring loss. The meeting also declared itself in opposition to any plan to register .303 rifles, but decided that their use ought to be restricted to those 18 and over.

The hard times apparently even affected telephone service. In 1936, the whole vast region west of Winton, all the way to Boulia, a distance of roughly 300 km, was served by a single party line – Winton 101 – which was leased from the Winton telephone provider by the Middleton Telephone Company, a private company based in Middleton, about halfway between Winton and Boulia. Only now, the line was falling into disrepair, with attendant unreliability in the service, and there were demands for it to be assumed by the government. The foreseen cost of doing this was then said to be £28,000.

Another public service was affected by these hard times, namely the ambulance brigade. A Mr. Charles Holland, from Ipswich, was the chosen one from among 25 applicants from all over Queensland to become Winton&#x27;s new superintendent of ambulance services. He left Ipswich for Winton on 7 April 1930, only to be dismissed a mere six months later owing to the pitiful state of the Winton ambulance committee&#x27;s finances. That same year, the Railway Department removed all stationmasters from its line between Winton and Hughenden, although the move apparently did not affect the stationmasters at those two towns. Work on dismantling a railway track that was to have been part of a considerable inland network was undertaken in 1931. The track only ever reached a short distance west of Winton. The work was partly a relief effort, with all the workmen involved in the job being drawn from the local unemployed. The two working railway links at Winton came in handy in 1932 when track washouts along the Queensland coast forced some travellers to take a long inland detour, by way of Winton. Winton railway station became very busy.

On 24 May 1933, which was Empire Day, Winton was honoured with a viceregal visit in the person of Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, the Governor of Queensland. He stayed in town overnight after having arrived by train from Hughenden with his wife, Lady Wilson and his entourage and taking part in a civic reception. His party left again by train the next morning bound for Longreach.

On 3 October 1934, a Qantas plane bound for Winton from Longreach, the &quot;Atlanta&quot; (in some sources, &quot;Atalanta&quot;), a de Havilland DH.50, caught fire in the air near its destination and the pilot tried, unsuccessfully, to make an emergency landing not far west of town before the fire on board set the fuel tank off. Complicating matters just then was a dust storm, which made for very poor visibility, and which later also delayed the sighting of the wreck by searchers. The aircraft came down in a ball of fire, killing the pilot and his two business passengers, one of whom, a sandalwood buyer named William McKnoe, was from Winton.

Modern road conditions apparently had yet to come to Winton in 1934. A visiting pastoral company general manager, commenting on roads in western Queensland in general said that the roads in the Shire of Cloncurry were the worst in the state, but added that among streets in the state&#x27;s towns, Winton&#x27;s were the worst in Queensland. A heatwave struck Winton the next month, with temperatures reaching a reported on 24 November.

On 5 August 1938, Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons visited Winton on an extended tour of Queensland, the first Prime Minister to visit the town since Stanley Bruce&#x27;s visit in 1927. The chairman of the Shire Council, T. J. Shanahan, had a wish list for the Prime Minister. He asked for assistance from both state and federal levels for the wool industry, an &quot;A class&quot; radio station and a railway to the Barclay Tableland (which has never been built). Further deputations also asked for improvements to Winton&#x27;s aerodrome and for national highways to be built in western Queensland.

It was another nine years before Winton&#x27;s demands for a radio station were met, and even then, the broadcasts were sent out from Longreach, not Winton. Nevertheless, there was proper wireless service beginning on 19 March 1947, when ABC&#x27;s transmitter at Longreach came into service.

Disaster struck Winton&#x27;s business community in September 1938 when a fire tore through several buildings in the middle of town. Destroyed were the Royal Mail Hotel, the Olympia Picture Theatre (whose projection room was in the hotel), a building and a house owned by townsman Stanton Mellick, and a building owned by a man named William Thomson who operated a hardware and saddlery shop with his brother, James Thomson. Some of these buildings contained several businesses. The fire broke out in the cinema&#x27;s spool room and spread quickly. Firefighters had to deal with low water pressure due to ongoing repairs. The damage caused by the fire was reckoned to be between £17,000 and £18,000. Nobody was injured.

A new St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church was opened on 8 May 1939 by Archbishop of Brisbane James Duhig assisted by Bishop of Rockhampton Romauld Denis Hayes and Bishop of Townsville Hugh Edward Ryan. The church building was designed by C.D. Lynch of Townsville and built by Jerry Rundle of Winton at a cost of £4,735. The first church was relocated behind the school.

===Second World War and later 20th century===
In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and Australia joined the Allies. There was a proposal, which met with great enthusiasm in Winton, to form a Western Battalion. A Colonel Hoad delivered a speech in June on the proposal at the Shire Hall before &quot;a big crowd of young men&quot;, asking them to join up to show their support for the Western Battalion. Forty men responded by joining up on the spot.

In June 1942, a United States Congressman stayed overnight at the North Gregory Hotel in Winton. This was an uncommon event in itself, especially during the Second World War, but it was made all the more so because he and a number of American military personnel – including two generals – had just survived an emergency landing of &quot;The Swoose&quot; at Carisbrooke Station, about 85 km southwest of Winton, and also because the Congressman happened to be Lyndon B. Johnson, who was later to become President of the United States.

On 27 June 1946, there was a royal visit as the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester came to visit Winton for half an hour.
On 7 August 1946, the North Gregory Hotel burnt down, for the third time, in a fire that also consumed several other nearby businesses. Firefighters&#x27; efforts were supplemented by a bucket brigade, but even so, the blaze took three hours to quench. The damage was set at £30,000. There was no mention of injuries.

In 1951, Winton held its first rodeo and it was very popular and successful. It quickly became a yearly event, and three years later, 4,700 people came into the town – whose population was then about 1,300 – for the rodeo. There was not enough room for them all at the local hotels, and 600 of them slept on stretcher beds brought into town by local graziers. There was £1050 in prize money.

In 1953, a replacement for the North Gregory Hotel – this one built of brick, not wood – was nearing completion. The task had been taken on by Winton Shire Council because nobody else could be found who was willing to build the replacement. The project&#x27;s estimated cost was £120,000. As of May that year, the Council still had not decided whether to run the hotel itself or to lease it to another operator. The hotel was to have amenities that were then quite uncommon in Central West Queensland, including air conditioning in the bar, the dining room and the lounge. The town was seeking to provide other, more public amenities in the late 1940s and early 1950s as well, including a £100,000 sewerage scheme and a cooling tower for the artesian bore water, which came out of the ground quite hot. The expenditure of £17,000 on this was &quot;essential if the water is to be 100 per cent. effective for fire-fighting.&quot; The same 1948 news item that announced these proposals also mentioned a project for a &quot;municipal hotel&quot;, needed after the North Gregory Hotel had burnt down, and the foreseen cost for that was &quot;between £30,000 and £40,000&quot;. There were obviously some cost overruns (see above).

In 1962, some fossilized dinosaur tracks were discovered at a quarry and are now on display at their original site in a climate-controlled building at Lark Quarry Dinosaur Trackways some southwest of Winton.

On 22 September 1966, there was another aviation disaster near Winton. Ansett-ANA Flight 149, a Vickers Viscount aircraft, had taken off from Mount Isa on a 73-minute flight to Longreach, when it ran into trouble 44 minutes into the flight, once an engine fire broke out. The blaze quickly spread to the fuel tank, resulting in part of the left wing breaking away. This sealed the aircraft&#x27;s fate. It crashed some west of Winton, at Nadjayamba Station, killing all 24 people on board. The crash site was not very far from where the 1934 &quot;Atlanta&quot; disaster had happened. On the 40th anniversary of the accident in 2006, a memorial was unveiled in the main street of Winton.

A third St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church was built in 1970; it was a brick church.
In &quot;1972/73&quot;, a new festival began in Winton, the Outback Festival. This is held every other year, in odd-numbered years, in September, and was originally conceived as something that would boost Winton&#x27;s local economy, for the years leading up to the first Outback Festival had been drought years.

In November 1974, Winton got its own television transmitter, ABWNQ-8. This broadcasts the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Queensland service, based in Brisbane. The tower stands about 20 km north of town.

Another Prime Minister visited Winton in 1979, Malcolm Fraser. He used the occasion to make known his government&#x27;s intention to undertake &quot;an urgent inquiry on how to overcome worsening fuel shortages.&quot;

In April 1995, Winton marked the centenary of &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; with a festival. Prime Minister Paul Keating and Queensland Premier Wayne Goss showed up for the festivities, and among other things, they unveiled a statue of Banjo Paterson. In 1998, the Waltzing Matilda Centre opened.

In 1999, a huge Cretaceous sauropod about 95 million years old was unearthed near Winton. It was dubbed &quot;Elliot&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2002, a &quot;non‐profit science initiative&quot; named Australian Age of Dinosaurs was established whose aim is to expose Australian dinosaurs at a world-class museum. One project sought to contain the Lark Quarry Dinosaur Trackways near Opalton inside a climate-controlled building to preserve and display them, a project that has been accomplished. In 2009, three new dinosaur species were given their scientific nomenclature (with nicknames in round brackets). They are &quot;Australovenator wintonensis&quot; (&quot;Banjo&quot;), &quot;Diamantinasaurus matildae&quot; (&quot;Matilda&quot;) and &quot;Wintonotitan wattsi&quot; (&quot;Clancy&quot;).

A cultural disaster struck Winton in June 2015 when the Waltzing Matilda Centre burnt down, destroying many artefacts.

On the night of 17 June 2015, fire broke out in the Waltzing Matilda Centre, the building that housed town&#x27;s information centre and a museum housing a collection of historic artifacts. Firefighters arrived within minutes to find the rear of the building engulfed in flames, the teams fought desperately to save the front of the building and any artifacts that hadn&#x27;t already been destroyed. Despite all efforts, the entire structure was reduced to a smouldering wreck with little evidence of the building ever housing such a unique museum. The fire has been deemed unsuspicious and investigators are currently looking for clues to the cause of the blaze. The building was unoccupied at the time of the fire and there were no casualties. The rebuilt museum reopened in April 2018.

== Demographics ==
At the , the town of Winton had a population of 954.

In the , the locality of Winton had a population of 875 people.

In the , the locality of Winton had a population of 856 people.

==Geography==
Winton lies on the north bank of the Western River, a braided river that often runs dry, made of many small channels, a landform that gives this region, the Channel Country, its name. The Western is joined from the north by Jessamine Creek and Mill&#x27;s Creek, both braided streams. Mistake Creek, likewise a braided stream, empties into the Western from the south. The Western itself flows westwards, eventually emptying into the Diamantina River at one of only three major confluences on that river. This lies some 60 km downstream. This puts Winton in the Lake Eyre basin. The land in the area is mostly flat grassland, which lends itself rather well to pastoral activity, an industry of some local importance to this day. Winton lies at the junction of the Kennedy Developmental Road and the Landsborough Highway, the two of which run concurrently from Winton&#x27;s south end as far as another junction a few kilometres west of town.

===Possible asteroid strike===
The Diamantina River&#x27;s hook-shaped upper reaches have drawn scientific attention. In March 2015, Geoscience Australia reported that the river&#x27;s course at and near its headwaters flows along the edge of a roughly circular crustal anomaly that might well be an impact structure. It is an area, as described by Richard Blewett, a senior official with Geoscience Australia, in diameter, characterized by geomagnetic anomalies, and Winton lies roughly 60 km beyond its eastern edge. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that recent seismic studies undertaken there indicated that long ago an asteroid or comet struck the area releasing energy equivalent to 650 million Hiroshima A-bombs (and thus roughly 41 zettajoules). The asteroid impact has not yet been confirmed, but this could be done with core samples from the ground in the central ring structure to a depth of hundreds of metres. The impact, if indeed this is the explanation for the anomaly, would have happened roughly 300 million years ago.

===Dinosaurs===
The area surrounding the town has yielded a number of dinosaur fossils. In 2009, the discoveries near the town of three Early Cretaceous dinosaur genera, &quot;Australovenator&quot;, &quot;Wintonotitan&quot; and &quot;Diamantinasaurus&quot;, were announced. &quot;Australovenator wintonensis&quot;, the type specimen of that genus, is named after the town. The specimens were unearthed at the &quot;Matilda site&quot; not far northwest of town, on Elderslie Station (site&#x27;s position roughly ), and at the &quot;Triangle Paddock Site&quot; right nearby. Another sauropod, &quot;Savannasaurus&quot;, was also found in this area, along with the as-of-yet unnamed &quot;Elliot&quot;. The town also lent its name to the geological formation in which the fossils were found, the Winton Formation.

===Great Artesian Basin===

Winton is situated on the Great Artesian Basin and draws its water for use in the town. This water emerges at and is cooled in ponds in Corfield to before it is circulated through the town. Sulphur gas gives the water an &#x27;eggy&#x27; smell.

As of 2018, Winton Shire Council is developing a geothermal power plant to replacing the water cooling process with one that converts the released heat into electricity. It is expected to generate 2000 megawatt hours per year.

===Street names===
The main streets in the town of Winton were named after the stations lying in the directions in which the streets were running. For instance, east and west — Elderslie, Vindex, Cork and Dagworth. Those facing the north were called Oondooroo, Manuka, Sesbania and Werna. Three of these stations, Dagworth, Vindex and Oondooroo, figure in the Waltzing Matilda story.

==Climate==
Winton experiences a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh); with very hot, moderately rainy summers and very mild, dry winters with cool nights. Average maxima remain warm to hot year-round: from in July to in December; but temperatures can exceed in any month. Average annual rainfall, concentrated in the summer is low: . Rain occurs within 31.5 rainfall days, and like in inland Queensland, is highly variable due to ENSO. The town is sunny: averaging 191.8 clear days and only 58.6 cloudy days annually. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 28 June 1908 and 25 July 1968 to on 1 December 2006.

==Attractions==
Winton&#x27;s visitor centre is located in the Waltzing Matilda Centre. The town has a range of museums including the heritage-listed former Corfield and Fitzmaurice emporium as well as the heritage truck and machinery museum.

===Waltzing Matilda Centre===
Winton is intimately involved in the story of the popular Australian folk song, &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, which had its first performance in the North Gregory Hotel in the town. The Waltzing Matilda Centre opened in 1998 and is the first museum dedicated to a song. The song was written by &#x27;Banjo&#x27; Paterson whilst holidaying at a local property, Dagworth Station. The music for the song was arranged by Christina Macpherson, the sister of the station manager who was visiting at the same time.

In 2012, to remind Australians of the song&#x27;s significance, Winton organised the inaugural Waltzing Matilda Day to be held on 6 April, the anniversary of its first performance.

<text>New Dorp ( ) is a neighborhood on the South Shore of Staten Island, New York City, United States. New Dorp is bounded by Mill Road on the southeast, Tysens Lane on the southwest, Amboy and Richmond Roads on the northwest, and Bancroft Avenue on the northeast. It is adjacent to Oakwood to the southwest, Todt Hill to the northwest, Dongan Hills and Grant City, and Midland Beach and Miller Field to the southeast. New Dorp Beach, bordering to the east, is often listed on maps as a separate neighborhood from Mill Road to the shore of Lower New York Bay, but is generally considered to be a part of New Dorp.

One of the earliest European settlements in the New York City area, New Dorp was founded by Dutch settlers from the New Netherland colony, and the name is an anglicization of , meaning &quot;New Village&quot; in Dutch. It was historically one of the most important towns on Staten Island, becoming a part of New York City in 1898 as part of the Borough of Richmond. In the 1960s New Dorp ceased to be a distinct town during New York City&#x27;s suburbanization, where rapid housing development on Staten Island saw the town added to the city conurbation. Despite this, today New Dorp remains one of the main commercial and transport centers on Staten Island.

New Dorp is often associated with the Vanderbilt family, who had a notable presence in the area and many of whom are buried in the neighborhood at the Moravian Cemetery, the largest and oldest active cemetery on Staten Island.

New Dorp is part of Staten Island Community District 2 and its ZIP Code is 10306. New Dorp is patrolled by the 122nd Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==History==

New Dorp was the location of the first county seat of Richmond County. Called Stony Brook, it was located approximately where Amboy Road experiences a sharp bend between the New Dorp and Oakwood train stations.

In 1667, at the end of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch Republic ceded their colony of New Netherland to England as a condition of the Treaty of Breda. The colony had been occupied by the English since 1664, and was re-branded as the Province of New York when it was granted as a proprietary colony to James, Duke of York. The areas of New Netherland already settled by the Dutch included the primary settlement of New Amsterdam (now renamed New York City) located at the southern tip of Manhattan Island, and numerous additional lands around the city and along the Hudson River. This included Staaten Eylandt, later anglicized as &quot;Staten Island&quot;, a sparsely populated island south-west of New York across Upper New York Bay. In 1670, the local Native Americans, mainly Raritans and other subgroups of the Lenape tribe, ceded all claims to Staten Island to the English in a deed to Governor Francis Lovelace.

New Dorp was founded in 1671 following the English resurveying the pre-existing Dutch settlement of (now Old Town) and expanded the lots along the South Shore, which were then settled primarily by Dutch families. The new lots became known as (meaning &quot;New Village&quot; in the Dutch language), in contrast with (meaning &quot;Old Village&quot;), and later became anglicized as New Dorp. The new village developed into one of the largest and most important settlements on Staten Island, and during the American Revolution it became a center of activity when it was occupied by British forces in preparation to attack the American-occupied New York City. The Rose and Crown Tavern in New Dorp, owned by the uncle of Cornelius Vanderbilt, temporarily served as the local British military headquarters.

In the late 19th century, New Dorp became the home to members of the prominent Vanderbilt family, many of whom are buried in the Moravian Cemetery, the largest and oldest active cemetery on Staten Island. On January 1, 1898, New Dorp was consolidated as part of New York City along with the entirety of Staten Island as the Borough of Richmond. The Vanderbilt farm was later used by the U.S. Army as Miller Air Field, and in the 1970s became part of Gateway National Recreation Area. New Dorp continued to be one of the primary settlements on Staten Island until the 1960s, when the suburbanization of New York City began to expand into the island. The largely rural character of Staten Island was replaced with the massive development of suburban housing, causing separate towns such as New Dorp to be absorbed into New York City&#x27;s conurbation and become one of many contiguous neighborhoods. New Dorp retained its distinct character as a town, and is one of the most thriving commercial centers on the Island which in the 1960s spread along Hylan Boulevard from New Dorp Lane and led to the construction of five shopping centers, anchored by supermarkets and department stores, with the largest being Hylan Plaza which opened in 1966.

The 1960 New York mid-air collision, where 134 people were killed and held the highest death toll for a commercial aviation accident until 1968, occurred over New Dorp.

<text>Hilling, earthing up or ridging is the technique in agriculture and horticulture of piling soil up around the base of a plant. It can be done by hand (usually using a hoe), or with powered machinery, typically a tractor attachment.

Hilling buries the normally above-ground part of the plant, promoting desired growth. This may encourage the development of additional tubers (as with potatoes), force the plant to grow longer stems (leeks), or for some crops (chicory, leeks, asparagus etc.) this blanching technique keeps the stems or shoots pale and tender, or influences their taste.

Hilling helps to smother weeds. It may also be used to stabilize the stems of crops which are easily disturbed by wind.

==Examples==

A common application of hilling is for potatoes. The tubers grow just below the surface, and can produce chlorophyll and solanine if exposed to light (green potatoes). Solanine is toxic in large doses, and can result in nausea, headache, and in rare cases, death. By hilling one or more times during the growing season – effectively, burying the potatoes in an additional few inches of soil – yield is improved, and the harvest remains edible.

In vineyards, at the beginning of the winter period:
* reduces the risk of damage by frost. Indeed, a heat gradient is formed by the thermal inertia of the earth. It is warmer inside the mound of soil.
* facilitates the flow of water (which presence is important because of precipitation during winter). The evacuation can be done via grooves.
* destroys weeds.

<doc id="432137" wikidata="Q4809185" url="?curid=432137" title="Associated Electrical Industries">
<text>Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) was a British holding company formed in 1928 through the merger of British Thomson-Houston (BTH) and Metropolitan-Vickers electrical engineering companies. In 1967 AEI was acquired by GEC, to create the UK&#x27;s largest industrial group. A scandal that followed the acquisition is said to have been instrumental in reforming accounting practices in the UK.

==Main subsidiaries==
* Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick)
* British Thomson-Houston (BTH)
* Ferguson, Pailin &amp; Co (switchgear)
* Edison Swan (lamps and radio valves) 
* AEI Lamp and Lighting
* Siemens Brothers &amp; Co (cables, telephone equipment and railway signaling apparatus) 
* Hotpoint (domestic appliances)
* Premier Electric Heaters (incorporated into Hotpoint)
* W.T. Henley (cables, insulators and low voltage switchgear) 
* Newton Victor (X-ray machines)
* Sunvic Controls (heating controls)
* Birlec (industrial electric furnaces)
* International Refrigerator Company
* Coldrator

==Takeover and restructuring==
Rivalry existed between Metrovick and BTH brands in the Electrical Engineering field, resulting in internal competition and duplicated management. In 1959 AEI decided to remove those brands and consolidate both as AEI brands, resulting in internal problems and a fall in sales and market value. The abandonment of two well known trademarks and the replacement with the unfamiliar AEI branding lost the company significant work to competitors and resulted in a market weakening of the company.

These problems paved the way for a takeover in 1967 with the recently restructured General Electric Company (GEC) under Arnold Weinstock. The following year GEC merged with English Electric. GEC took over AEI Cables and Hackbridge Cables Co. in 1967, forming the company AEI Cables Ltd. in 1968.

GEC also went through substantial restructuring, including in 1989 forming GEC Alsthom and Cegelec Projects. GEC Alsthom was created from the GEC&#x27;s Power and Transport businesses (originally AEI (previously BTH and Metrovick) and English Electric) and the French Compagnie Générale d&#x27;Electricité (CGE). The merger was to enable both companies a gain a greater export potential into Europe.

The GEC facilities in Rugby were split into GEC Alstom and Cegelec Projects, but in 1998 the two companies were reunited under the Alstom banner.

An issue relevant to UK employment and insolvency law arose in 2011, when there was a steep increase in the price of copper; AEI Cables Lid. experienced difficult trading conditions and declared itself insolvent. Considering making some staff redundant, they were challenged in the Employment Tribunal for failing to comply with the requirement for 90 days of consultation under TUPE law (section 188 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992). The Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled that it was not reasonable to expect an insolvent employer to continue trading for 90 days in order to accommodate this legal requirement and in these particular circumstances ruled that 60 days was sufficient.

<text>A season is a division of the year marked by changes in weather, ecology, and the amount of daylight. The growing season is that portion of the year in which local conditions (i.e. rainfall, temperature, daylight) permit normal plant growth. While each plant or crop has a specific growing season that depends on its genetic adaptation, growing seasons can generally be grouped into macro-environmental classes.

Axial tilt of the Earth inherently affect growing seasons across the globe.

==Geography==
Geographic conditions have major impacts on the growing season for any given area. Latitude is one of the major factors in the length of the growing season. The further from the equator one goes, the angle of the Sun gets lower in the sky. Consequently, sunlight is less direct and the low angle of the Sun means that soil takes longer to warm during the spring months, so the growing season begins later. The other factor is altitude, with high elevations having cooler temperatures which shortens the growing season compared with a low-lying area of the same latitude.

== Locations ==

=== North America ===
The continental United States ranges from 49° north at the US-Canadian border to 25° north at the southern tip of the US-Mexican border. Most populated areas of Canada are below the 55th parallel. North of the 45th parallel, the growing season is generally 4–5 months, beginning in late April or early May and continuing to late September-early October, and is characterized by warm summers and cold winters with heavy snow. South of the 30th parallel, the growing season is year-round in many areas with hot summers and mild winters. Cool season crops such as peas, lettuce, and spinach are planted in fall or late winter, while warm season crops such as beans and corn are planted in late winter to early spring. In the desert Southwest, the growing season effectively runs in winter, from October to April as the summer months are characterized by extreme heat and arid conditions, making it inhospitable for plants not adapted to this environment.

Certain crops such as tomatoes and melons originated in subtropical or tropical regions. Consequently, they require hot weather and a growing season of eight months or more. In colder climate areas where they cannot be directly sowed in the ground, these plants are usually started indoors in a greenhouse and transplanted outside in late spring or early summer. 

===Europe===
The Pyrenees, Alps, and Southern Carpathians effectively divide Europe into two regions. Southern Europe and the Mediterranean are in general south of the 45th parallel. The growing seasons last six months or more, and the climate is characterized by hot summers and milder winters. Precipitation mainly falls between October and March, while summers are dry. In the extreme south of Europe, the growing season can be year-round. Vegetation on the Mediterranean islands is often evergreen because of the relatively warm winters.

Northern and Central Europe extend north from the 45th parallel past the Arctic Circle. The growing seasons are shorter because of the lower angle of the Sun and generally range from five months to as little as three in the highlands of Scandinavia and Russia. Climate on the Atlantic coast is considerably moderated by humid ocean air, which makes winters comparatively mild, and freezing weather or snow are rare. Because summers are also mild, many heat-loving plants such as maize do not typically grow in Northwestern Europe. Further inland, winters become considerably colder. Despite the short growing season in parts of Scandinavia and northern Russia, the extreme length of daylight during summer (17 hours or more) allows plants to put on significant growth.

===Tropics and deserts===
In some warm climates, such as the tropical savanna climates (&quot;Aw&quot;), the hot semi-arid climates (&quot;BSh&quot;), the hot desert climates (&quot;BWh&quot;) or the Mediterranean climates (&quot;Cs&quot;), the growing season is limited by the availability of water, with little growth in the dry season. Unlike in cooler climates where snow or soil freezing is a generally insurmountable obstacle to plant growth, it is often possible to greatly extend the growing season in hot climates by irrigation using water from cooler and/or wetter regions. This can in fact go so far as to allow year-round growth in areas that without irrigation could only support xerophytic plants.

In the tropical regions, the growing season can be interrupted by periods of heavy rainfall, called the rainy season. For example, in Colombia, where coffee is grown and can be harvested year-round, they do not see a rainy season. However, in Indonesia, another large coffee-producing area, they experience this rainy season and the growth of the coffee beans is interrupted.

<doc id="432143" wikidata="Q910530" url="?curid=432143" title="White metal">
<text>The white metals are a series of often decorative bright metal alloys used as a base for plated silverware, ornaments or novelties, as well as any of several lead-based or tin-based alloys used for things like bearings, jewellery, miniature figures, fusible plugs, some medals and metal type. The term is also used in the antiques trade for an item suspected of being silver, but not hallmarked.

A white metal alloy may include antimony, tin, lead, cadmium, bismuth, and zinc (some of which are quite toxic). Not all of these metals are found in all white metal alloys. Metals are mixed to achieve a desired goal or need. As an example, a base metal for jewellery needs to be castable, polishable, have good flow characteristics, have the ability to cast fine detail without an excessive amount of porosity and cast at between .

==Silver==
In compliance with British law, the British fine art trade uses the term &quot;white metal&quot; in auction catalogues to describe foreign silver items which do not carry British Assay Office hallmarks, but which are nonetheless understood to be silver and are priced accordingly.

==Tin-lead and tin-copper alloys==
Tin-lead and tin-copper alloys such as Babbitt metal have a low melting point, which is ideal for use as solder, but these alloys also have ideal characteristics for plain bearings. Most importantly for bearings, the material should be hard and wear-resistant and have a low coefficient of friction. It must also be shock-resistant, tough and sufficiently ductile to allow for slight misalignment prior to running-in.

Pure metals are soft, tough and ductile, with a high coefficient of friction. Intermetallic compounds are hard and wear-resistant but brittle. By themselves, they do not make ideal bearing materials.

Alloys consist of small particles of a hard compound embedded in the tough, ductile background of a solid solution. In service, the latter can wear away slightly, leaving the hard compound to carry the load. That wear also provides channels to allow in lubricant (oils). All bearing metals contain antimony (Sb), which forms hard cubic crystals.

== Applications ==
White metals are commonly used in bearings and bushings because of their high load-bearing capacity and self-lubricating properties, which reduce friction and extend the lifespan of these components. In the automotive industry, they are found in engine components like crankshaft and connecting rod bearings. Additionally, white metal is popular in jewellery and decorative items due to its cost-effectiveness and ability to mimic more expensive metals like silver. In the printing industry, white metal alloys were historically used to cast typefaces.

<doc id="432144" wikidata="Q4786454" url="?curid=432144" title="Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton">
<text>Archibald William Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton, 1st Earl of Winton, KT, PC (29 September 18124 October 1861), styled Lord Montgomerie from 1814 to 1819, was a British Conservative politician. He was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1852 and again from 1858 to 1859.

==Early life==
Eglinton was born in Palermo, Sicily, the son of Major-General Archibald Montgomerie, Lord Montgomerie (30 July 17734 January 1814), the eldest son of Hugh Montgomerie, 12th Earl of Eglinton. His mother was Lady Mary Montgomerie (died 1848), daughter of General Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton. After his father&#x27;s death, his mother married Sir Charles Lamb, 2nd Baronet.

He was educated at Eton. As a pastime he enjoyed playing golf. One of his playing partners was James Ogilvie Fairlie.

==Career==
Eglinton was a staunch Tory. In 1846, he was a whip in the House of Lords; on 28 May 1846, he spoke against the Corn Importation Bill; in May 1848 he opposed the Jewish Disabilities Bill. 

In February 1852, he became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland under the Earl of Derby. He retired with the ministry in the following December. When Derby returned to office in February 1858 he was again appointed Lord-Lieutenant, and he discharged the duties of this post until June 1859.

In this year he was created Earl of Wintoun, an earldom which had been held by his kinsfolk, the Setons, from 1600 until 1716, when George Seton, 5th Earl of Wintoun, was deprived of his honours for high treason.
Anstruther gives the date for this creation as 1840. The Earl&#x27;s kinswoman, Georgina Talbot, in celebration of the restoration of the title, gave the slightly altered name &#x27;Winton&#x27; then in Hampshire now Winton, Dorset to a residential development in Bournemouth, which she was creating at this time.

===Horse racing===
Lord Eglinton&#x27;s main object of interest for some years was the turf; he kept a large racing stud and won success and reputation in the sporting world. His most successful horse was The Flying Dutchman which won The Derby and St Leger Stakes in 1849.

===The Eglinton Tournament===
In 1839, Lord Eglinton&#x27;s name became more widely known in connection with the Eglinton Tournament. This took place at Eglinton castle and is said to have cost him £30,000 or £40,000. Contemporary ridicule is better remembered today than its successes. 

It was partly spoiled by the unfavourable weather, the rain falling in torrents, but it was a real tournament, participants having attended regular training during the course of the year prior and lances being broken in the orthodox way. Prince Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III) and Lady Seymour, a granddaughter of Richard Brinsley Sheridan and the wife of Lord Seymour, afterwards 12th Duke of Somerset, took part. 

A list of the challengers with an account of the jousts and the mêlée will be found in the volume on the tournament written by the Reverend John Richardson, with drawings by James Henry Nixon (1843). It was also described in Disraeli&#x27;s &quot;Endymion&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lord Eglinton married, firstly, on 17 February 1841, Theresa Howe Cockerell, née Newcomen, widow of Captain Richard Howe Cockerell RN (1798–1839, buried Park St, Calcutta). Mrs Cockerell was an illegitimate daughter (out of 8 children) of Thomas Gleadowe-Newcomen, 2nd Viscount Newcomen (1776–1825) and his long-term mistress Harriet Holland. Theresa Newcomen was born in Calcutta in 1809, and died on 16 December 1853 at Eglinton Castle. They had the following children: 

* Archibald Montgomerie, 14th Earl of Eglinton (1841–1892)
* Lady Egidia Montgomerie (–1880), who married Frederick Thellusson, 5th Baron Rendlesham.
* Hon. Seton Montolieu Montgomerie (1846–1883), who married and left daughters.
* George Montgomerie, 15th Earl of Eglinton (1848–1919), ancestor of the present Earl.

According to Eglinton&#x27;s entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, as cited here, this marriage was the great mistake of his life. However, his stepdaughter Anna Theresa Cockerell (1836–1912), aided by her mother&#x27;s second marriage, went on to marry Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 19th Earl of Shrewsbury.

After Theresa&#x27;s death in December 1853, her widower married, secondly, the Hon. Adela Caroline Harriett, daughter of Arthur Capell, 6th Earl of Essex, in 1858. They had the following children:

* Lady Sybil Amelia Montgomerie (d. 1932)
* Lady Hilda Rose Montgomerie (d. 1928), who married Tonman Mosley, 1st Baron Anslow and died at Bangors, Iver, Buckinghamshire.

Lady Adela died in December 1860, aged only 32. Lord Eglinton survived her by less than a year before dying at Mount Melville House, near St. Andrews, on 4 October 1861, and was buried in the family vault at Kilwinning, Ayrshire, on 11 October 1861. He was succeeded by his eldest son Archibald.

===Legacy===
A statue of Lord Eglinton was erected in St Stephen&#x27;s Green, Dublin in 1866 and was destroyed in an explosion by the IRA in 1958.

In New Zealand, Mount Eglinton and the Eglinton River are named in his honor.

<doc id="432147" wikidata="Q1065627" url="?curid=432147" title="Charles Nelson Reilly">
<text>Charles Nelson Reilly (January 13, 1931 – May 25, 2007) was an American actor, comedian, director and drama teacher. He performed in the original Broadway casts of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;; &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;; and &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. His television credits include &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot; and &quot;Match Game&quot;. A recording of his autobiographical one-man play &quot;Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly&quot; was adapted into a 2006 independent film.

==Early life==
Reilly was born January 13, 1931, in New York City in the Bronx, to an Irish-Catholic father and a Swedish Lutheran mother. When young, he would amuse himself by creating puppet theater, and his mother often told him to &quot;save it for the stage&quot;.

At age 13, he survived the 1944 Hartford Circus Fire, which killed 167 people in Connecticut, and he was afraid to sit in an audience ever again. Because of the event&#x27;s trauma, he rarely attended theater, stating that the large crowds reminded him of what happened that day. As he often stated on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and other such venues, even as the director of a play or stage production, he preferred to sit at the back of the house or the back of a balcony near the exits to preview his work, including one time where his leading lady&#x27;s costume caught fire (but on recounting this episode to Johnny Carson, Reilly assured him &quot;but you know, these things always work out okay.&quot;)

Reilly developed a love of opera and wanted to become an opera singer. He entered the Hartt School of Music as a voice major, but abandoned this pursuit when he realized that he lacked the natural vocal talent to have a major career. However, opera remained a lifelong passion, and he was a frequent guest on opera-themed radio programs, including the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. He directed opera productions for the Chicago Opera Theater, Dallas Opera, Portland Opera, San Diego Opera, and Santa Fe Opera. He was good friends with opera singers Renée Fleming, Rod Gilfry, Roberta Peters, and Eileen Farrell.

==Career==
===Stage===
Reilly made his film debut with an uncredited role in &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957), directed by Elia Kazan, although most of his early career was spent on the stage. He was a regular performer in comic roles for several summer seasons in the 1950s at the Starlight Theatre in Kansas City, Missouri. Reilly appeared in many Off Broadway productions. His big break came in 1960 with the enormously successful original Broadway production of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;. In the groundbreaking musical, Reilly had a small onstage part and was Dick Van Dyke&#x27;s understudy/replacement for the leading role.

In 1961, Reilly was in the original cast of another Broadway show, the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;. For his memorable origination of the role of Bud Frump, Reilly earned a 1962 Tony Award for featured actor in a musical.

In 1964, Reilly was in the original cast of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, another successful Broadway show. For originating the role of Cornelius Hackl, Reilly received a second nomination for a Tony Award for performance by an actor in a featured role in a musical.

===Television===
Reilly kept active in Broadway shows but he became better known for his TV work, appearing regularly on television in the 1960s. He appeared as a Mystery Guest and was a panelist on the &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; quiz show. In 1965 he appeared several times on &quot;The Steve Lawrence Show&quot;, which aired for a single season. Television commercials that he made throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s included Excedrin, Bic Banana Ink Crayons and Purina Mills Dog Food.

From 1968 to 1970, he appeared as the bumbler Claymore Gregg on the television series &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot;, for which he received an Emmy nomination. He also appeared as a regular on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and had guest appearances on various television series, including &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and &quot;Love, American Style&quot;. In 1971, he appeared as the evil magician Hoodoo in &quot;Lidsville&quot;, a children&#x27;s program on ABC created by Sid and Marty Krofft.

Reilly was a frequent guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, appearing more than 100 times. He was a lively and reliable talk-show guest and lived within blocks of the Burbank studios where &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; was taped, so he was often asked to be a last-minute replacement for scheduled guests who canceled or did not make it to the studio on time.

Reilly was a fixture on game shows, primarily due to his appearances as a regular panelist on &quot;Match Game&quot;. He was one of the longest-running guests, and often engaged in playful banter with fellow regular Brett Somers (the two generally sat next to each other on the show—Somers in the upper middle seat and Reilly in the upper right seat). He typically offered sardonic commentary and peppered his answers with homosexuality-themed double entendres which pushed the boundaries of 1970s television standards.

During the taping of &quot;Match Game &#x27;74&quot;, Reilly left for a short time to film &quot;Hamburgers&quot; (1974) and to star in the Neil Simon play &quot;God&#x27;s Favorite&quot; (December 1974 to March 1975). From 1975 to 1976, he starred in another live-action children&#x27;s program titled &quot;Uncle Croc&#x27;s Block&quot;, with Jonathan Harris. He was often a guest celebrity on the 1984 game show &quot;Body Language&quot;, including one week with Lucille Ball and another week with Audrey Landers.

===Later career===
From 1976, Reilly primarily taught acting and directing for television and theater, including directing Julie Harris (with whom he had acted in &quot;Skyscraper&quot; in 1965–66), who was portraying Emily Dickinson in her one-woman Broadway play &quot;The Belle of Amherst&quot;, by William Luce. In 1979, he directed Ira Levin&#x27;s play &quot;Break a Leg&quot; on Broadway. Despite the previous year&#x27;s success of Levin&#x27;s &quot;Deathtrap,&quot; &quot;Break a Leg&quot; closed after one performance. Within days, Reilly appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, joking and speaking at length about the show&#x27;s failure, saying, &quot;So [a play] can open and last six years, eight years ... or two hours and five minutes.&quot; Reilly earned a 1997 Tony Award nomination as Best Director of a Play for the revival of &quot;The Gin Game&quot;, starring Julie Harris.

In 1988, Reilly hosted the syndicated game show &quot;Sweethearts&quot;, which ran for one season.

In 1990, he directed episodes of &quot;Evening Shade&quot;. Reilly also made guest appearances in the 1990s on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Second Noah&quot;, and as eccentric writer Jose Chung in the television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; (&quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;From Outer Space&quot;&quot;), &quot;Millennium&quot; (&quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;Doomsday Defense&quot;&quot;), and occasionally as the voice of the Dirty Bubble in the animated series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; before he was replaced by Tom Kenny. Reilly was nominated for Emmy Awards in 1998 and 1999 for his performances in &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; and &quot;Millennium&quot;, respectively.

Reilly was a longtime teacher of acting at HB Studio, the acting studio founded by Herbert Berghof and made famous by Berghof and his wife, the renowned stage actress Uta Hagen. His acting students included Lily Tomlin, Bette Midler, and Gary Burghoff.

Reilly had a voice role in three films by Don Bluth: &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; as Killer in 1989, &quot;Rock-a-Doodle&quot; as Hunch in 1991, and &quot;A Troll in Central Park&quot; as King Llort in 1994. In each one, he played the villain&#x27;s dim-witted sidekick who reformed at the end.

==Personal life==
Magazine and newspaper profiles of Reilly throughout the 1970s and 1980s did not mention his personal life. Years after the cancellation of &quot;Match Game&quot;, he revealed his orientation as gay in his July 2000 theatrical one-man show &quot;Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly&quot;.

Much like fellow actor and game-show regular Paul Lynde of the same era, despite Reilly&#x27;s off-camera silence, he gave signals on-camera of a campy persona. In many episodes of &quot;Match Game&quot;, he lampooned himself by briefly affecting &quot;YO!&quot; in a deep voice, using the nickname &quot;Chuck&quot;, and self-consciously describing how &quot;butch&quot; he was. Many years after his game show career ended, he mentioned in a 2002 interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; that he felt no need to explain his jokes about Chuck and that he never purposely hid his homosexuality from anyone. Patrick Hughes, a set decorator and dresser, was Reilly&#x27;s domestic partner; the two met backstage while Reilly appeared on the game show &quot;Battlestars&quot;, although their partnership was not revealed publicly. They lived together in Beverly Hills.

Reilly did appear on several episodes of the game show &quot;Tattletales&quot; with actress Elizabeth Allen as a couple, though their &quot;relationship&quot; was never discussed on the air.

Reilly was associated with the United States Coast Guard and made at least two films in conjunction with the Coast Guard. He regularly advertised National Safe Boating Week as a panelist on &quot;Match Game&quot;. Reilly died on May 25, 2007, the last day of National Safe Boating Week.

Despite sporting what appeared to be a full head of hair for most of the prime of his television career, Reilly was in fact bald, wearing a toupée throughout most of his appearances in the 1970s and 1980s. During the taping of &quot;Match Game &#x27;74&quot;, his toupée became a joke when Reilly had to go to New York City to have his toupée adjusted. During the taping of several episodes, Reilly was seen wearing different hats because his toupée was back in New York waiting for him to be fitted. This was the start of the long-running jokes on &quot;Match Game&quot; about his hair. He abandoned the toupée in the late 1990s and appeared bald in all of his subsequent public events. He dramatized the experience in his stage show &quot;The Life of Reilly&quot;. In one episode of &quot;Match Game PM&quot;, he took off his toupée and gave it to a bald contestant by putting it on his head. One can briefly see Reilly&#x27;s bald head before he covers it up with a hat.

==Final years and death==

Reilly spent his later life primarily touring the U.S. directing theater and opera and offering audiences a glimpse into his background and personal life with a critically acclaimed one-man play chronicling his life, titled &quot;Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly&quot;. In 2004, his final two performances of his play in North Hollywood, California, were recorded as the basis of an autobiographical independent film titled &quot;The Life of Reilly&quot;.

Reilly was stricken with respiratory problems while filming &quot;The Life of Reilly&quot; and retired from directing and performing immediately after the final day of shooting in 2004. The movie premiered in March 2006 at the South by Southwest film festival, and Reilly&#x27;s film performance was acclaimed. He cancelled his personal appearance at South by Southwest due to his illness, and by the time the film premiered, he had been hospitalized. Reilly died of complications from pneumonia at the UCLA Medical Center on May 25, 2007. That weekend, the Game Show Network dedicated its programming to Reilly, airing some of his funniest episodes of &quot;Match Game&quot;.

==In popular culture==
For &quot;Big Lizard in My Backyard&quot;, their 1985 debut album, Philadelphia punk band The Dead Milkmen recorded a song titled &quot;Serrated Edge&quot; that features numerous absurd references to Reilly as a Jesus figure and orgy centerpiece.

In 2001, Reilly was the subject of a sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, spoofing &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, and was portrayed by Alec Baldwin. A later Baldwin character, the Generalissimo from &quot;30 Rock&quot;, mentions both Julie Harris and &quot;The Belle of Amherst&quot;, which Reilly had directed. A 2008 parody of &quot;Match Game&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; included Fred Armisen playing a Reilly-like character. In the sketch, the host is found murdered moments before the show&#x27;s taping; the subsequent on-air police investigation reveals that he had been having a clandestine homosexual affair with the Reilly character. Baldwin briefly reprised his portrayal of Reilly in the &quot;30 Rock&quot; episode &quot;Live from Studio 6H&quot; (West Coast airing), appearing on the &quot;joke wall&quot; in a parody of &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic wrote and recorded a tribute song titled &quot;CNR&quot; done in the style of The White Stripes, jokingly caricaturing Reilly with parodies of the internet phenomenon Chuck Norris Facts, with absurdities like winning the Tour de France &quot;with two flat tires and a missing chain&quot;, or how &quot;every day he&#x27;d make the host of &quot;Match Game&quot; give him a piggyback ride&quot;. This was part of Yankovic&#x27;s digital &quot;Internet Leaks&quot; EP and was included on the 2011 CD release &quot;Alpocalypse&quot;. The music video was released by JibJab on August 4, 2009. Yankovic again referenced Reilly within a sight gag present in the end credits of his 2022 spoof biopic &quot;&quot; which implies that Reilly engaged in career-long stalking of the fictionalized Yankovic.

In season two, episode one of &quot;The Life and Times of Tim&quot;, one character observes another acting a line from their play and says, &quot;I saw Charles Nelson Reilly do that, and you did it better.&quot;

<text>Todt Hill ( ) is a hill formed of serpentine rock on Staten Island, New York. It is the highest natural point in the five boroughs of New York City and the highest elevation on the entire Atlantic coastal plain from Florida to Cape Cod. The summit of the ridge is largely covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt, although much of the surrounding area is developed and residential. It is considered one of the most exclusive and most expensive areas of Staten Island.

==History==
The name Todt comes from the German word &quot;Tod&quot; for &quot;death&quot; and may refer to the cemetery (the present Moravian Cemetery, opened in 1740 and now the island&#x27;s largest cemetery) on the southwestern foot of the ridge near the town of New Dorp that has been in use since colonial days. An alternate explanation is that the name was given by early Dutch settlers because of treeless rocky exposures on the hilltop, caused by the soil of the Staten Island Serpentinite locality.

At the beginning of the 20th century, many houses designed by the architect Ernest Flagg were built in the area. A significant part of Todt Hill is now included in the Staten Island Greenbelt.

==Geography==
The term Todt Hill is now often used to include the upscale developments in the hills along the eastern side of the ridge, which most island geographers classify as part of the neighborhood of Dongan Hills.

Two small, natural ponds are found on Todt Hill, and a Roman Catholic priory is located near the summit. Staten Island Academy, a private school, moved its campus to Todt Hill in the 1960s. There is a golf course adjoining the Moravian Cemetery, each of which has a man-made pond. Otherwise the hill is either parkland or private homes. There is no public transit available on Todt Hill, and most of the streets, including Todt Hill Road, the neighborhood&#x27;s main thoroughfare, lack sidewalks.

The point of highest elevation is the unmarked rise in the street level at the intersection of Dalemere Road and Chapin Avenue.

==Demographics==
Todt Hill consists of the two census tracts 177 and 181, although census tract 177 incorporates part of Emerson Hill. According to the 2010 census, the demographics of Todt Hill were 80% non Hispanic White, 1% Black, 11% Asian, and 1% Multiracial. Hispanics of any race made up 7% of the population. The median household income of the area is roughly $120,000. Todt Hill is one of Staten Island&#x27;s most affluent areas.

As of 2011, the district houses about 11,000 inhabitants. The population density was approximately 1,400 people per square kilometer.

Based on latest information, the population density according to one neighborhood guide has increased to 3,000 people per square mile(about 1,158 people per square kilometer). These discrepancies may arise from varying methodologies in calculating population density or differing definitions of the neighborhood&#x27;s boundaries.

==Notable residents==
* The Gambino crime family boss Paul Castellano lived there, in a house noted for its intended resemblance to the White House. His family continued to live on Todt Hill after his death, but moved in 2000.
* &quot;Mob Wives&quot; reality television star Drita D’Avanzo grew up in the Todt Hill Houses.
* Former New York Mets relief pitcher John Franco currently lives on the hill.
* The Corleone family compound from &quot;The Godfather&quot; was filmed on Todt Hill.
* Frank Matthews, a notorious drug kingpin in the 1970s, lived on Todt Hill.
* Frank Cali, acting boss of the Gambino crime family, was killed outside his home in Todt Hill on March 13, 2019.

==Transportation==
Todt Hill is served by multiple bus routes on Richmond Road, including the local buses, and the express bus.

<doc id="432150" wikidata="Q7529596" url="?curid=432150" title="Sir William Fraser, 4th Baronet">
<text>Sir William Augustus Fraser, 4th Baronet (10 February 1826 – 17 August 1898), of Pilton House, near Barnstaple, Devon, was an English politician, author and collector. He was elected member of parliament for Barnstaple (Devon) in 1852, and again in 1857, and for Ludlow (Shropshire) in 1863 and for Kidderminster (Worcestershire) in 1874.

==Origins==
He was the eldest son and heir of Sir James Fraser, 3rd Baronet, a colonel of the 7th Hussars, who had served on Wellington&#x27;s staff at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

==Biography==
Fraser was educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating B.A. and M.A. In 1847 he was appointed an officer in the 1st Life Guards, but retired with a captain&#x27;s rank in 1852. He then set about entering parliament, and the ups and downs of his political career were rather remarkable. He was returned for Barnstaple in 1852, but the election was declared void on account of bribery, and the constituency was disfranchised for two years.

At the election of 1857 Sir William, who had meantime been defeated at Harwich, was again returned at Barnstaple. He was, however, defeated in 1859, but was elected in 1863 at Ludlow. This seat he held for only two years, when he was again defeated and did not re-enter parliament until 1874, when he was returned for Kidderminster, a constituency he represented for six years, when he retired. He was a familiar figure at the Carlton Club, always ready with a copious collection of anecdotes of Wellington, Benjamin Disraeli and Napoleon III.

William Fraser was a member of the Society of Dilettanti (1857) and the author of the book &quot;Members of the Society of Dilettanti, 1736–1874, edited by Sir William Frazer&quot;, Chiswick Press.

==Bibliography==
Books written by him include:
*&quot;Words on Wellington&quot; (1889)
*&quot;Disraeli and His Day&quot; (1891)
*&quot;Hic et Ubique&quot; (1893)
*&quot;Napoleon III.&quot; (1896)
*&quot;Waterloo Ball&quot; (1897). A book on the Duchess of Richmond&#x27;s ball.

==Death==
He died in Westminster on 17 August 1898, aged 72.

==Bequests==
Fraser bequeathed a large fortune to be accumulated in trust during twenty-one years for the benefit of his nephew, Sir Keith Alexander Fraser, eldest son of General James Keith Fraser, formerly colonel of the 1st Life Guards, who succeeded him in the baronetcy. 
By his will dated 1 December 1886, and proved in October 1898, he further bequeathed a splendid collection of Gillray&#x27;s caricatures to the House of Lords, a similar collection of H.B.&#x27;s caricatures, and a unique set of portraits of former speakers to the House of Commons; the chairs of Thackeray and Dickens respectively to the Travellers&#x27; Club and the Athenaeum, Horatio Nelson&#x27;s sword to the United Service Club, Byron&#x27;s sofa to the Garrick Club, the manuscript of Gray&#x27;s &#x27;Elegy&#x27; to Eton College library, and the Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s sword to the Scots Guards at St James&#x27;s Palace.

The chief portion of Sir William Fraser&#x27;s library was sold by auction by Messrs. Sotheby, 22 to 30 April 1901, and one thousand eight hundred and fifty-two lots fetched £20,334 18&quot;s&quot;., or more than twice what Fraser had given for them. The chief items were extra-illustrated books and books with autograph inscriptions by distinguished persons.

<doc id="432153" wikidata="Q8836279" url="?curid=432153" title="Chick Hafey">
<text>Charles James &quot;Chick&quot; Hafey (February 12, 1903 – July 2, 1973) was an American player in Major League Baseball (MLB). Playing for the St. Louis Cardinals (1924–1931) and Cincinnati Reds (1932–1935, 1937), Hafey was a strong line-drive hitter who batted for a high average on a consistent basis.

Hafey was part of two World Series championship teams (in 1926 and 1931) as a Cardinal and also made history with the first hit in an All-Star game, starting in left field and batting cleanup for the National League in the 1933 game. He was selected by the Veterans Committee for the Baseball Hall of Fame in . In 2014, the Cardinals inducted him into their team hall of fame.

==Early life==
Hafey was born on February 12, 1903, in Berkeley, California. He attended Berkeley High School. The St. Louis Cardinals signed Hafey out of high school as a pitcher. However, Cardinals business manager Branch Rickey noticed Hafey&#x27;s hitting abilities and decided that Hafey should become an outfielder.

==Career==

===St. Louis Cardinals===
Hafey played in the minor leagues for the Fort Smith Twins of the Western Association in 1923. He moved to the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League the next year, hitting .360 before being called up to the Cardinals near the end of the season. He split time between the Cardinals and Syracuse Stars in 1925. He spent the 1926 season with the Cardinals, but he played only 78 games.

Hafey was the first major success of Rickey&#x27;s expansive farm system, breaking through in 1927 when he led the National League in slugging. Hafey, however, had suffered multiple beanings in 1926. He developed sinus trouble and his vision deteriorated, and Hafey began to wear eyeglasses while playing. Although Specs Toporcer was the first baseball player to wear glasses, Hafey was the most prominent; he is one of two Hall of Famers with eyeglasses, Reggie Jackson being the other. Because his vision became so variable, Hafey was obliged to rotate among three different pairs of glasses.

In the field, Hafey was known for having a &quot;rifle arm.&quot; He had a power peak, averaging 27 home runs and 114 RBI from 1928 to 1930. In July 1929, Hafey tied a National League record with ten hits in ten consecutive at-bats. In August 1930, he hit for the cycle. In 1931, Hafey won one of the closest races for a batting title in history, hitting .349 to beat New York&#x27;s Bill Terry by just .0002, and teammate Jim Bottomley by .0007. The title was only secured by a hit in Hafey&#x27;s final at-bat of the season. Hafey was fifth in the voting for the 1931 MVP award. When Hafey&#x27;s Cardinals faced Al Simmons&#x27; Athletics in the 1931 World Series, it marked just the second time that two reigning batting champions had opposed one another in the Fall Classic.

Although the soft-spoken Hafey was overshadowed by some of his raucous Cardinals teammates, he was frequently at odds with management. Hafey&#x27;s 1931 and 1932 seasons both began late due to salary disputes. Cardinals general manager Rickey fined Hafey for being late and out of shape in 1931. In 1932, coming off his batting title, Hafey demanded that the previous year&#x27;s fine be added to his 1932 salary. When Rickey refused, Hafey bolted from St. Louis&#x27; spring training camp. Rickey responded by trading Hafey to the last-place Cincinnati Reds.

===Cincinnati Reds===
Hafey was happy to join the Reds, who gave him the raise he had sought, but his career faltered. His vision was still erratic, and his persistent sinus condition cost him half of the 1932 season, though he hit .344. In 1933, he was chosen for the inaugural All Star Game, recording the first-ever All-Star hit. Although he maintained a solid batting average as a Red, his offensive production decreased.

In June 1935, suffering from sinus problems and influenza, he returned to his ranch near Berkeley and his relatives there said that he would not return to baseball that season. The team wanted team surgeons to perform sinus surgery, but Hafey planned to have a procedure performed by his own doctor. He tried a minor league comeback in 1936, but he gave that up in April because he was experiencing vision problems and dizzy spells still attributed to sinusitis.

Hafey announced that he would attempt another comeback with the Reds in February 1937. Not long after that, Hafey abandoned that comeback due to a salary dispute. In May, he announced that he would work out with a Pacific Coast League team to work his way back to the Cardinals. He hit .261 in 89 major league games that year. He was released before the 1938 season by general manager Warren Giles when they could not agree to contract terms.

He finished his career batting .317, with 164 home runs and 833 RBI. Hafey played in four World Series, hitting .205 in 92 plate appearances. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Hafey in their 1981 book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. They cited what they called &quot;the Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome,&quot; where a player of truly exceptional talent might rank with the all-time greats on merit, despite a career sharply curtailed by injury.

==Honors==
Hafey was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971. Sabermetrician Bill James has listed Hafey as one of ten examples of Hall of Fame inductees who do not deserve the honor. In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Hafey among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

<doc id="432169" wikidata="Q881023" url="?curid=432169" title="Samuel Huntington (Ohio politician)">
<text>Samuel Huntington (October 4, 1765 – June 8, 1817) was an American jurist who was the third governor of Ohio from 1808 to 1810.

==Biography==
Huntington was born in Coventry in the Colony of Connecticut. He was the nephew (and, later, the adopted son) of Samuel Huntington, the fourth President of the Continental Congress and first President of the United States in Congress Assembled under the Articles of Confederation.

Huntington studied at Dartmouth College until the end of his junior year. He then transferred to Yale College, from which he was graduated in 1785. He was admitted to the bar and began practicing law in Connecticut. In 1801, he moved to Ohio with his wife, Hannah, and their young sons, settling in the tiny village of Cleveland.

==Career==
After serving as a Trumbull county delegate to the State&#x27;s first constitutional convention, Huntington was selected as an associate justice of the Ohio Supreme Court and succeeded Return J. Meigs, Jr. as Chief Justice a year later. He served until being elected Governor in 1808. His tenure was stormy, with much controversy over the impeachment of two judges for upholding the principle of judicial review (Huntington would have been impeached as well had he not been being elected governor), the move of the state capital from Zanesville to Chillicothe, and the Tiffin Resolution, which terminated the terms of all sitting judges. Huntington did not stand for re-election, but instead ran for the U.S. Senate, losing to Thomas Worthington.

Huntington was also an active Freemason, and served as the second Grand Master of the Grand Lodge F.&amp;A.M. of Ohio in 1809.

<doc id="432172" wikidata="Q3494227" url="?curid=432172" title="Spring Heel Jack">
<text>Spring Heel Jack is an English electronic music duo, consisting of John Coxon and Ashley Wales. 

Formed in 1993 in London, England, Spring Heel Jack began their career exploring drum and bass and jungle, but have since branched out into free improvisation and jazz, collaborating with many musicians from Europe and the United States.

==History==
Wales was formerly a composer of contemporary classical music and leader of the band Crazy About Love, while Coxon was a successful remixer and producer (most notably for Betty Boo) prior to their joining forces. 

Their first three drum and bass albums released during the 1990s earned positive reviews for their innovative take on the genre. They also co-wrote and produced the 1996 track &quot;Walking Wounded&quot;, a major UK hit for Everything But The Girl featuring Ben Watt who had earlier been sacked from Crazy About Love. 

The cinematic &quot;Disappeared&quot; (2000) marked a transition for Wales and Coxon, and featured the British saxophonist John Surman, whose appearance was a harbinger of later changes.

&quot;Masses&quot; (2001), the first of several albums for the cross-genre Blue Series on Thirsty Ear, was an even more radical departure. Collaborators included saxophonists Evan Parker, John Tchicai and Tim Berne; bassist William Parker; trumpeters Roy Campbell, Kenny Wheeler and Wadada Leo Smith; trombonist Paul Rutherford; drummer Han Bennink; pianist Matthew Shipp; and guitarist Jason Pierce.

In 2006 Coxon and Wales began to operate a record label, Treader, releasing CDs by themselves and other associated artists, including some of their recent collaborators.

<doc id="432174" wikidata="Q9395337" url="?curid=432174" title="Mulch">
<text>A mulch is a layer of material applied to the surface of soil. Reasons for applying mulch include conservation of soil moisture, improving fertility and health of the soil, reducing weed growth, and enhancing the visual appeal of the area.

A mulch is usually, but not exclusively, organic in nature. It may be permanent (e.g. plastic sheeting) or temporary (e.g. bark chips). It may be applied to bare soil or around existing plants. Mulches of manure and compost will be incorporated naturally into the soil by the activity of worms and other organisms. The process is used both in commercial crop production and in gardening, and when applied correctly, can improve soil productivity.

Living mulches include moss lawns and other ground covers.

==Uses==
Many materials are used as mulches, which are used to retain soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, suppress weed growth, and for aesthetics. They are applied to the soil surface, around trees, paths, flower beds, to prevent soil erosion on slopes, and in production areas for flower and vegetable crops. Mulch layers are normally or more deep when applied.

Although mulch can be applied around established plants at any time, they may be applied at various times of the year depending on the purpose. Towards the beginning of the growing season, mulches serve initially to warm the soil by helping it retain heat which is otherwise lost during the night. This allows early seeding and transplanting of certain crops, and encourages faster growth. Mulch acts as an insulator. As the season progresses, mulch stabilizes the soil temperature and moisture, and prevents the growing of weeds from seeds.

In temperate climates, the effects of mulches depend upon the time of year in which they are applied. When applied in fall and winter, mulches delay the growth of perennial plants in the spring and prevent growth in winter during warm spells, thus limiting freeze–thaw damage.

The effect of mulch upon soil moisture content is complex. Mulch forms a layer between the soil and the atmosphere reducing evaporation. However, mulch can also prevent water from reaching the soil by absorbing or blocking water from light rains and overly thick layers of mulch can reduce oxygen in the soil.

In order to maximise the benefits of mulch, while minimizing its negative influences, it is often applied in late spring/early summer when soil temperatures have risen sufficiently, but soil moisture content is still relatively high. However, permanent mulch is also widely used and valued for its simplicity, as popularized by author Ruth Stout, who said, &quot;My way is simply to keep a thick mulch of any vegetable matter that rots on both sides of my vegetable and flower garden all year long. As it decays and enriches the soils, I add more.&quot;

== Materials ==
Materials used as mulches vary and depend on a number of factors. Use takes into consideration availability, cost, appearance, the effect it has on the soil—including chemical reactions and pH, durability, combustibility, rate of decomposition, how clean it is—some can contain weed seeds or plant pathogens.

A variety of materials are used as mulch:
* Organic residues: grass clippings, leaves, hay, straw, kitchen scraps, comfrey, shredded bark, whole bark nuggets, sawdust, shells, woodchips, shredded newspaper, cardboard, wool, animal manure, etc. Many of these materials also act as a direct composting system, such as the mulched clippings of a mulching lawn mower, or other organics applied as sheet composting.
* Compost: fully composted materials (humus) are used to avoid possible phytotoxicity problems. Materials that are free of seeds are ideally used, to prevent weeds being introduced by the mulch.
* Rubber mulch: made from recycled tire rubber.
* Plastic mulch: crops grow through slits or holes in thin plastic sheeting. This method is predominant in large-scale vegetable growing, with millions of acres cultivated under plastic mulch worldwide each year. Disposal of plastic mulch is cited as an environmental problem but there are also degradable plastic mulches.
* Rock and gravel can also be used as a mulch. In cooler climates the heat retained by rocks may extend the growing season.

In some areas of the United States, such as central Pennsylvania and northern California, mulch is often referred to as &quot;tanbark&quot;, even by manufacturers and distributors. In these areas, the word &quot;mulch&quot; is used specifically to refer to very fine tanbark or peat moss.

===Organic mulches===

Organic mulches decay over time and are temporary. The way a particular organic mulch decomposes and reacts to wetting by rain and dew affects its usefulness. Some mulches such as straw, peat, sawdust and other wood products may for a while negatively affect plant growth because of their wide carbon to nitrogen ratio, because bacteria and fungi that decompose the materials remove nitrogen from the surrounding soil for growth. Organic mulches can mat down, forming a barrier that blocks water and air flow between the soil and the atmosphere. Vertically applied organic mulches can wick water from the soil to the surface, which can dry out the soil. Mulch made with wood can contain or feed termites, so care must be taken about not placing mulch too close to houses or building that can be damaged by those insects. Mulches placed too close to plant stems and tree trunks can contribute to their failure. Some mulch manufacturers recommend putting mulch several inches away from buildings.

Commonly available organic mulches include:

====Leaves====
Leaves from deciduous trees, which drop their foliage in the autumn/fall. They tend to be dry and blow around in the wind, so are often chopped or shredded before application. As they decompose they adhere to each other but also allow water and moisture to seep down to the soil surface. Thick layers of entire leaves, especially of maples and oaks, can form a soggy mat in winter and spring which can impede the new growth of lawn grass and other plants. Dry leaves are used as winter mulches to protect plants from freezing and thawing in areas with cold winters; they are normally removed during spring.

====Grass clippings====
Grass clippings, from mowed lawns are sometimes collected and used elsewhere as mulch. Grass clippings are dense and tend to mat down, so are mixed with tree leaves or rough compost to provide aeration and to facilitate their decomposition without smelly putrefaction. Rotting fresh grass clippings can damage plants; their rotting often produces a damaging buildup of trapped heat. Grass clippings are often dried thoroughly before application, which militates against rapid decomposition and excessive heat generation. Fresh green grass clippings are relatively high in nitrate content, and when used as a mulch, much of the nitrate is returned to the soil, conversely the routine removal of grass clippings from the lawn results in nitrogen deficiency for the lawn.

====Peat moss====
Peat moss, or sphagnum peat, is long lasting and packaged, making it convenient and popular as a mulch. When wetted and dried, it can form a dense crust that does not allow water to soak in. When dry it can also burn, producing a smoldering fire. It is sometimes mixed with pine needles to produce a mulch that is friable. It can also lower the pH of the soil surface, making it useful as a mulch under acid loving plants.

However, peat bogs are a valuable wildlife habitat, and peat is also one of the largest stores of carbon (in Britain, out of a total estimated 9952 million tonnes of carbon in British vegetation and soils, 6948 million tonnes carbon are estimated to be in Scottish, mostly peatland, soils)

====Wood chips====
Wood chips are a byproduct of the pruning of trees by arborists, utilities and parks; they are used to dispose of bulky waste. Tree branches and large stems are rather coarse after chipping and tend to be used as a mulch at least three inches thick. The chips are used to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature and suppress weed growth. Wood chip mulches on the top of the soil increase nutrient levels in soils and associated plant foliage, contrary to the myth that wood chip mulch tie up nitrogen. Wood chips are most often used under trees and shrubs. When used around soft stemmed plants, an unmulched zone is left around the plant stems to prevent stem rot or other possible diseases. They are often used to mulch trails, because they are readily produced with little additional cost outside of the normal disposal cost of tree maintenance. Wood chips come in various colors.

Woodchip mulch is a byproduct of reprocessing used (untreated) timber (usually packaging pallets), to dispose of wood waste. The chips are used to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature and suppress weed growth. Woodchip mulch is often used under trees, shrubs or large planting areas and can last much longer than arborist mulch. In addition, many consider woodchip mulch to be visually appealing, as it comes in various colors. Woodchips can also be reprocessed into playground woodchip to be used as an impact-attenuating playground surfacing.

====Bark chips====
Bark chips of various grades are produced from the outer corky bark layer of timber trees. Sizes vary from thin shredded strands to large coarse blocks. The finer types are very attractive but have a large exposed surface area that leads to quicker decay. Layers two or three inches deep are usually used, bark is relativity inert and its decay does not demand soil nitrates. Bark chips are also available in various colors.

====Straw mulch / field hay / salt hay====

Straw mulch or field hay or salt hay are lightweight and normally sold in compressed bales. They have an unkempt look and are used in vegetable gardens and as a winter covering. They are biodegradable and neutral in pH. They have good moisture retention and weed controlling properties but also are more likely to be contaminated with weed seeds. Salt hay is less likely to have weed seeds than field hay. Straw mulch is also available in various colors.

====Pine straw====
Needles that drop from pine trees are termed &quot;pine straw&quot;. It is available in bales. Pine straw has an attractive look and is used in landscape and garden settings. On application pine needles tend to weave together, a characteristic that helps the mulch hold stormwater on steeper slopes. This interlocking tendency combined with a resistance to floating gives it further advantages in maintaining cover and preventing soil erosion. The interlocking tendency also helps keep the mulch structure from collapsing and forming a barrier to infiltration. Pine straw is reputed to create ideal conditions for acid-loving plants. Pine straw may help to acidify soils but studies indicate this effect is often too small to be measurable.

====Biodegradable mulch====
Biodegradable mulches are made out of plant starches and sugars or polyester fibers. These starches can come from plants such as wheat and maize. These mulch films may be a bit more permeable allowing more water into the soil. This mulch can prevent soil erosion, reduce weeding, conserve soil moisture, and increase temperature of the soil. Ultimately this can reduce the amount of herbicides used and manual labor farmers may have to do throughout the growing season. At the end of the season these mulches will start to break down from heat. Microorganisms in the soil break down the mulch into two components, water and carbon dioxide, leaving no toxic residues behind. This source of mulch requires less manual labor since it does not need to be removed at the end of the season and can actually be tilled into the soil. With this mulch it is important to take into consideration that it is much more delicate than other kinds. It should be placed on a day which is not too hot and with less tension than other synthetic mulches. These also can be placed by machine or hand but it is ideal to have a more starchy mulch that will allow it to stick to the soil better.

====Cardboard / newspaper====
Cardboard or newspaper can be used as semi-organic mulches. These are best used as a base layer upon which a heavier mulch such as compost is placed to prevent the lighter cardboard/newspaper layer from blowing away. By incorporating a layer of cardboard/newspaper into a mulch, the quantity of heavier mulch can be reduced, whilst improving the weed suppressant and moisture retaining properties of the mulch. However, additional labour is expended when planting through a mulch containing a cardboard/newspaper layer, as holes must be cut for each plant. Sowing seed through mulches containing a cardboard/newspaper layer is impractical. Application of newspaper mulch in windy weather can be facilitated by briefly pre-soaking the newspaper in water to increase its weight.

===Synthetic===
====Rubber====
====Plastics====

Plastic mulch used in large-scale commercial production is laid down with a tractor-drawn or standalone layer of plastic mulch. This is usually part of a sophisticated mechanical process, where raised beds are formed, plastic is rolled out on top, and seedlings are transplanted through it. Drip irrigation is often required, with drip tape laid under the plastic, as plastic mulch is impermeable to water.

====Polypropylene and polyethylene mulch====
Polypropylene mulch is made up of polypropylene polymers where polyethylene mulch is made up of polyethylene polymers. These mulches are commonly used in many plastics. Polyethylene is used mainly for weed reduction, whereas polypropylene is used mainly on perennials. This mulch is placed on top of the soil and can be done by machine or hand with pegs to keep the mulch tight against the soil. This mulch can prevent soil erosion, reduce weeding, conserve soil moisture, and increase temperature of the soil. Ultimately this can reduce the amount of work a farmer may have to do, and the amount of herbicides applied during the growing period. The black and clear mulches capture sunlight and warm the soil increasing the growth rate. White and other reflective colours will also warm the soil, but they do not suppress weeds as well. This mulch may require other sources of obtaining water such as drip irrigation since it can reduce the amount of water that reaches the soil. This mulch needs to be manually removed at the end of the season since when it starts to break down it breaks down into smaller pieces. If the mulch is not removed before it starts to break down eventually it will break down into ketones and aldehydes polluting the soil. This mulch is technically biodegradable but does not break down into the same materials the more natural biodegradable mulch does.

====Colored mulch====
Some organic mulches are colored red, brown, black, and other colors using synthetic additives. Isopropanolamine, specifically 1-Amino-2-propanol or monoisopropanolamine, may be used as a pigment dispersant and color fastener in these mulches. Types of mulch which can be dyed include: wood chips, bark chips (barkdust) and pine straw. Colored mulch is made by dyeing the mulch in a water-based solution of colorant and chemical binder.

When colored mulch first entered the market, most formulas were suspected to contain toxic substances, heavy metals and other contaminates. Today, &quot;current investigations indicate that mulch colorants pose no threat to people, pets or the environment. The dyes currently used by the mulch and soil industry are similar to those used in the cosmetic and other manufacturing industries (i.e., iron oxide)&quot;, as stated by the Mulch and Soil Council.
According to colorant manufacturer Colorbiotics, independent laboratory studies show that the colorants used in colored mulch are safer than table salt or baking soda.

Colored mulch can be applied anywhere non-colored mulch is used (such as large bedded areas or around plants) and features many of the same gardening benefits as traditional mulch, such as improving soil productivity and retaining moisture. As mulch decomposes, just as with non-colored mulch, more mulch may need to be added to continue providing benefits to the soil and plants. However, if mulch is faded, spraying dye to previously spread mulch in order to restore color is an option.

==Anaerobic (sour) mulch==
Organic mulches often smell like freshly cut wood but sometimes they start to smell like vinegar, ammonia, sulfur or silage. This happens when material with ample nitrogen content is not rotated often enough and it forms pockets of increased decomposition. When this occurs, the process may become anaerobic and produce phytotoxic materials in small quantities. Once exposed to the air, the process quickly reverts to an aerobic process, but the anaerobic metabolites may be present for a period of time. Plants low to the ground or freshly planted are the most susceptible, and phytotoxicity from the produced chemicals may prevent germination of some seeds.

==Groundcovers (living mulches)==

Groundcovers are plants which grow close to the ground, under the main crop, to slow the development of weeds and provide other benefits of mulch. They are usually fast-growing plants that continue growing with the main crops. By contrast, cover crops are incorporated into the soil or killed with herbicides. However, live mulches also may need to be mechanically or chemically killed eventually to prevent competition with the main crop.

Some groundcovers can perform additional roles in the garden such as nitrogen fixation in the case of clovers, dynamic accumulation of nutrients from the subsoil in the case of creeping comfrey (&quot;Symphytum ibericum&quot;), and even food production in the case of &quot;Rubus tricolor&quot;.

==On-site production==
Owing to the great bulk of mulch which is often required on a site, it is often impractical and expensive to source and import sufficient mulch materials. An alternative to importing mulch materials is to grow them on site in a &quot;mulch garden&quot; – an area of the site dedicated entirely to the production of mulch which is then transferred to the growing area. Mulch gardens should be sited as close as possible to the growing area so as to facilitate transfer of mulch materials.

<text>Lewis structuresalso called Lewis dot formulas, Lewis dot structures, electron dot structures, or Lewis electron dot structures (LEDs)are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule, as well as the lone pairs of electrons that may exist in the molecule. Introduced by Gilbert N. Lewis in his 1916 article &quot;The Atom and the Molecule&quot;, a Lewis structure can be drawn for any covalently bonded molecule, as well as coordination compounds. Lewis structures extend the concept of the electron dot diagram by adding lines between atoms to represent shared pairs in a chemical bond.

Lewis structures show each atom and its position in the structure of the molecule using its chemical symbol. Lines are drawn between atoms that are bonded to one another (pairs of dots can be used instead of lines). Excess electrons that form lone pairs are represented as pairs of dots, and are placed next to the atoms.

Although main group elements of the second period and beyond usually react by gaining, losing, or sharing electrons until they have achieved a valence shell electron configuration with a full octet of (8) electrons, hydrogen (H) can only form bonds which share just two electrons.

== Construction and electron counting ==
For a neutral molecule, the total number of electrons represented in a Lewis structure is equal to the sum of the numbers of valence electrons on each individual atom. Non-valence electrons are not represented in Lewis structures.

Once the total number of valence electrons has been determined, they are placed into the structure according to these steps:
# Initially, one line (representing a single bond) is drawn between each pair of connected atoms.
# Each bond consists of a pair of electrons, so if &quot;t&quot; is the total number of electrons to be placed and &quot;n&quot; is the number of single bonds just drawn, &quot;t&quot;−2&quot;n&quot; electrons remain to be placed. These are temporarily drawn as dots, one per electron, to a maximum of eight per atom (two in the case of hydrogen), minus two for each bond.
# Electrons are distributed first to the outer atoms and then to the others, until there are no more to be placed.
# Finally, each atom (other than hydrogen) that is surrounded by fewer than eight electrons (counting each bond as two) is processed as follows: For every two electrons needed, two dots are deleted from a neighboring atom and an additional line is drawn between the two atoms. This represents the conversion of a lone pair of electrons into a bonding pair, which adds two electrons to the former atom&#x27;s valence shell while leaving the latter&#x27;s electron count unchanged.
# In the preceding steps, if there are not enough electrons to fill the valence shells of all atoms, preference is given to those atoms whose electronegativity is higher.

Lewis structures for polyatomic ions may be drawn by the same method. However when counting electrons, negative ions should have extra electrons placed in their Lewis structures; positive ions should have fewer electrons than an uncharged molecule. When the Lewis structure of an ion is written, the entire structure is placed in brackets, and the charge is written as a superscript on the upper right, outside the brackets.

===Miburo method===
A simpler method has been proposed for constructing Lewis structures, eliminating the need for electron counting: the atoms are drawn showing the valence electrons; bonds are then formed by pairing up valence electrons of the atoms involved in the bond-making process, and anions and cations are formed by adding or removing electrons to/from the appropriate atoms.

A trick is to count up valence electrons, then count up the number of electrons needed to complete the octet rule (or with hydrogen just 2 electrons), then take the difference of these two numbers. The answer is the number of electrons that make up the bonds. The rest of the electrons just go to fill all the other atoms&#x27; octets.

===Lever method===
Another simple and general procedure to write Lewis structures and resonance forms has been proposed.

This system works in nearly all cases, however there are 3 instances where it will not work. These exceptions are outlined in the table below.
== Formal charge ==

In terms of Lewis structures, formal charge is used in the description, comparison, and assessment of likely topological and resonance structures by determining the apparent electronic charge of each atom within, based upon its electron dot structure, assuming exclusive covalency or non-polar bonding. It has uses in determining possible electron re-configuration when referring to reaction mechanisms, and often results in the same sign as the partial charge of the atom, with exceptions. In general, the formal charge of an atom can be calculated using the following formula, assuming non-standard definitions for the markup used:

:formula_1
where:
* formula_2 is the formal charge.
* formula_3 represents the number of valence electrons in a free atom of the element.
* formula_4 represents the number of unshared electrons on the atom.
* formula_5 represents the total number of electrons in bonds the atom has with another.

The formal charge of an atom is computed as the difference between the number of valence electrons that a neutral atom would have and the number of electrons that belong to it in the Lewis structure. Electrons in covalent bonds are split equally between the atoms involved in the bond. The total of the formal charges on an ion should be equal to the charge on the ion, and the total of the formal charges on a neutral molecule should be equal to zero.

== Resonance ==

For some molecules and ions, it is difficult to determine which lone pairs should be moved to form double or triple bonds, and two or more different &quot;resonance&quot; structures may be written for the same molecule or ion. In such cases it is usual to write all of them with two-way arrows in between . This is sometimes the case when multiple atoms of the same type surround the central atom, and is especially common for polyatomic ions.

When this situation occurs, the molecule&#x27;s Lewis structure is said to be a resonance structure, and the molecule exists as a resonance hybrid. Each of the different possibilities is superimposed on the others, and the molecule is considered to have a Lewis structure equivalent to some combination of these states.

The nitrate ion (), for instance, must form a double bond between nitrogen and one of the oxygens to satisfy the octet rule for nitrogen. However, because the molecule is symmetrical, it does not matter &quot;which&quot; of the oxygens forms the double bond. In this case, there are three possible resonance structures. Expressing resonance when drawing Lewis structures may be done either by drawing each of the possible resonance forms and placing double-headed arrows between them or by using dashed lines to represent the partial bonds (although the latter is a good representation of the resonance hybrid which is not, formally speaking, a Lewis structure).

When comparing resonance structures for the same molecule, usually those with the fewest formal charges contribute more to the overall resonance hybrid. When formal charges are necessary, resonance structures that have negative charges on the more electronegative elements and positive charges on the less electronegative elements are favored.

Single bonds can also be moved in the same way to create resonance structures for hypervalent molecules such as sulfur hexafluoride, which is the correct description according to quantum chemical calculations instead of the common expanded octet model.

The resonance structure should not be interpreted to indicate that the molecule switches between forms, but that the molecule acts as the average of multiple forms.

== Example ==
The formula of the nitrite ion is .

# Nitrogen is the least electronegative atom of the two, so it is the central atom by multiple criteria.
# Count valence electrons. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons; each oxygen has 6, for a total of (6 × 2) + 5 = 17. The ion has a charge of −1, which indicates an extra electron, so the total number of electrons is 18.
# Connect the atoms by single bonds. Each oxygen must be bonded to the nitrogen, which uses four electrons—two in each bond.
# Place lone pairs. The 14 remaining electrons should initially be placed as 7 lone pairs. Each oxygen may take a maximum of 3 lone pairs, giving each oxygen 8 electrons including the bonding pair. The seventh lone pair must be placed on the nitrogen atom.
# Satisfy the octet rule. Both oxygen atoms currently have 8 electrons assigned to them. The nitrogen atom has only 6 electrons assigned to it. One of the lone pairs on an oxygen atom must form a double bond, but either atom will work equally well. Therefore, there is a resonance structure.
# Tie up loose ends. Two Lewis structures must be drawn: Each structure has one of the two oxygen atoms double-bonded to the nitrogen atom. The second oxygen atom in each structure will be single-bonded to the nitrogen atom. Place brackets around each structure, and add the charge (−) to the upper right outside the brackets. Draw a double-headed arrow between the two resonance forms.

== Alternative formations ==
Chemical structures may be written in more compact forms, particularly when showing organic molecules. In condensed structural formulas, many or even all of the covalent bonds may be left out, with subscripts indicating the number of identical groups attached to a particular atom.
Another shorthand structural diagram is the skeletal formula (also known as a bond-line formula or carbon skeleton diagram). In a skeletal formula, carbon atoms are not signified by the symbol C but by the vertices of the lines. Hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon are not shown—they can be inferred by counting the number of bonds to a particular carbon atom—each carbon is assumed to have four bonds in total, so any bonds not shown are, by implication, to hydrogen atoms.

Other diagrams may be more complex than Lewis structures, showing bonds in 3D using various forms such as space-filling diagrams.

== Usage and limitations ==
Despite their simplicity and development in the early twentieth century, when understanding of chemical bonding was still rudimentary, Lewis structures capture many of the key features of the electronic structure of a range of molecular systems, including those of relevance to chemical reactivity. Thus, they continue to enjoy widespread use by chemists and chemistry educators. This is especially true in the field of organic chemistry, where the traditional valence-bond model of bonding still dominates, and mechanisms are often understood in terms of curve-arrow notation superimposed upon skeletal formulae, which are shorthand versions of Lewis structures. Due to the greater variety of bonding schemes encountered in inorganic and organometallic chemistry, many of the molecules encountered require the use of fully delocalized molecular orbitals to adequately describe their bonding, making Lewis structures comparatively less important (although they are still common).

There are simple and archetypal molecular systems for which a Lewis description, at least in unmodified form, is misleading or inaccurate. Notably, the naive drawing of Lewis structures for molecules known experimentally to contain unpaired electrons (e.g., O2, NO, and ClO2) leads to incorrect inferences of bond orders, bond lengths, and/or magnetic properties. A simple Lewis model also does not account for the phenomenon of aromaticity. For instance, Lewis structures do not offer an explanation for why cyclic C6H6 (benzene) experiences special stabilization beyond normal delocalization effects, while C4H4 (cyclobutadiene) actually experiences a special &quot;destabilization&quot;. Molecular orbital theory provides the most straightforward explanation for these phenomena.

<text>HMAS &quot;Acute&quot; (P 81) was an operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Acute&quot; was laid down by Evans Deakin and Company at Brisbane, launched on 26 August 1967, and commissioned on 26 April 1968.

==Operational history==
&quot;Acute&quot; was predominantly used for training of Royal Australian Navy Reserve personnel at Fremantle, Western Australia. From November 1978 until the 1980s, &quot;Acute&quot; was attached to the Permanent Naval Force, and was assigned to the newly completed base at . Before the Two Ocean Policy was completely implemented, the patrol boat was for several years the only warship assigned to Western Australia (with the nickname &quot;The Lone Gun of the West Coast&quot;), and responsible for patrolling an area extending from Albany to Broome. Whilst on a training cruise in May 1983, &quot;Acute&quot; apprehended two Taiwanese fishing boats engaged in illegal fishing. This was the first such operation involving RANR personnel.

&quot;Acute&quot; paid off on 6 May 1983. She was transferred to the Indonesian Navy and renamed &quot;Silea&quot;. The patrol boat was listed in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; as still operational in 2011.

<text>Cimiez (; Italian: &quot;Cimella&quot;) is an upper-class neighborhood in Nice, Southern France. The area contains the Musée Matisse and the ruins of &quot;Cemenelum&quot;, capital of the Ancient Roman province Alpes Maritimae on the Ligurian coast. &quot;Cemenelum&quot; was an important rival of Nice, continuing to exist as a separate city till the time of the Lombard invasions. The ruins include an arena, amphitheater, thermal baths, and paleochristian basilica. 

During the Belle Epoque Cimiez became a favourite holiday resort of European royalty: Victoria, Edward VII, George V, and Leopold II stayed in Cimiez. 

Close to the ruins is the Excelsior Régina Palace, where Queen Victoria spent part of her long visits to the French Riviera.

From 1974 to 2010 the Nice Jazz Festival was held among the Roman ruins in July each year. (In 2011 the festival moved to the Place Masséna.)

Also here can be found the Cimiez monastery and church, used by the Franciscan friars since the 16th century. The church, with a baroque altar from the seventeenth century and a marble cross from 1477, houses the paintings &quot; Pietà&quot; (triptych from 1475), &quot;Crucifixion&quot; (1512) and &quot;Deposition&quot; (1515) by the Italian artist Ludovico Brea. On display are also more than 300 documents and works of art from the 15th to 18th centuries. Buried in the cemetery near the monastery are the painters Henri Matisse and Raoul Dufy, alongside the winner of the 1937 Nobel Prize for Literature, Roger Martin du Gard.

Cimiez contains a large Jewish population (around 20%).

<text>The Porteous family is a Scottish Borders armigerous family.

==History==
The earliest records for members of the Porteous family in Peeblesshire date back to the early part of the fifteenth century.

The earliest possible reference, according to Lord Lyon King of Arms in Edinburgh, is to a Guillaume Porteuse (later William Porteous), who arrived from Normandy c 1400 under the patronage of the wealthy Fraise family (later to become the Frasers). They had already settled in parts of lowland Scotland, having been granted lands by the King.

The early meaning of the name Porteuse (from the French) was indeed possibly of &#x27;courier&#x27; or &#x27;messenger&#x27;. But in Scotland, they turned their hand to other trades. In the days when the glens and hamlets of Tweeddale and, later, Annandale were much more densely populated than today, they seem to have pursued various occupations – from millers and blacksmiths to ministers of religion.

The home of early members of the Porteous family for many hundreds of years was Hawkshaw in Peeblesshire. The link to modern day families is as yet unproven. There is some doubt as to how long the family had held the ancestral family home, but it is certain that there was a castle of sorts at Hawkshaw, probably built as no more than a small fortified keep, and intended as a watch tower where a signal fire could be lit to warn of approaching danger. A line of these so-called Peel towers was built in the 1430s across the Tweed valley from Berwick to its source, as a response to the dangers of attacks from the Border reivers. Hawkshaw was one of over two dozen of these in Peeblesshire alone.

During the eighteenth century there began a massive migration of families from Scotland, initially to England and Ireland – and eventually to the New World and the newly discovered countries of the British Empire.

The reasons for this were many – and changed considerably during the following three hundred years. The historical background was turbulent and Scotland saw many changes which led to emigration of large numbers of both Highland and Lowland families.

The Lowland Clearances (1760–1830), especially, resulted in a massive movement of poor Scots from the Lowlands to the growing industrial centres of Glasgow and northern England – to Newcastle, Liverpool and eventually to London and other large cities and ports. Families were tempted by the offer of employment in the fast-growing industries which had burgeoned with the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the promise of a higher standard of living.

The subsequent depopulation of the Lowlands and the Highland Potato Famine of 1836–37 added to those who chose to leave. Over 1.7 million people left Scotland from 1846 to 1852, primarily going to Nova Scotia and Canada. 
They left in vast numbers to seek better fortune on the other side of the Atlantic.

==The Porteous family today==
Branches of the family having emigrated to five continents, there is an active family research group which seeks to help family members seeking more information about their ancestors. The cairn at Hawkshaw has, over the years, become a place of pilgrimage for members of the Porteous family, and an international reunion was traditionally held at the nearby Crook Inn, Tweedsmuir every five years, attracting visitors from all over the world. In September 2021 it is planned that the celebrations will be held nearby, as the inn has been bought by a Tweedsmuir community group and is currently being refurbished.

<text>Ursus is a genus in the family Ursidae (bears) that includes the widely distributed brown bear, the polar bear, the American black bear, and the
Asian black bear. The name is derived from the Latin &quot;ursus&quot;, meaning &quot;bear&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
===Extant species===




A hybrid between grizzly bears and polar bears has also been recorded. Known commonly as a pizzly, prizzly, or grolar bear, the official name is simply &quot;grizzly–polar bear hybrid&quot;.

==Mating system ecology==

The mating systems within the genus &quot;Ursus&quot; are primarily classified as polygynous, polyandrous and promiscuous. Both males and females mate with more than one partner and use various strategies to increase their reproductive success. Since bears are sexually dimorphic, sexual conflict is a primary driving force behind sexual selection influencing intra-sexual and inter-sexual competition. Unlike more social species bears, being solitary mammals, have wide-ranging habitats to locate potential mates. Due to the asynchrony of oestrous phases and lengthy parental care by females, bear populations are usually male-biased, meaning that females are more choosy and males are more competitive. Intra-sexual selection is then characterized by male-male competitions influenced by female mate choice.

Mating seasons fluctuate based on species dependent on geographical location. American black bears &quot;(Ursus amercanus)&quot;, brown bears &quot;(Ursus arctos)&quot; and polar bears &quot;(Ursus maritimus)&quot; all have mating seasons occurring within a three-month duration during the spring and summer months (approximately May – July), with delayed implantation occurring in late fall (November), and cubs born within the den during early winter (January). Females, on average, mate with three to four males during a mating season and mating males have more variation, mating with one to eight females during a mating season. Since reproductive success is positively correlated with age and size in bear populations, there are also males that do not mate at all until they are able to compete with larger males. There is a very loose dominance hierarchy within bear mating systems due to their solitary nature. Majority of dominance hierarchies are found at food congregations in which population density is high and individuals are ranked based on size, mass, aggressiveness and willingness to fight. Overall, dominance hierarchies have lower adaptive strategies in solitary species and dominance is established based on encounters during the breeding season.

The mating system is generally characterised by two main components, the search phase and the encounter phase. During the breeding season, both males and females expand their home ranges to help increase the likelihood of finding potential mates. Males, especially, adapt a roaming strategy, covering a large geographic range to find receptive females and tracking them via chemoreceptors. Male bears are not considered to be territorial, but they do have large home ranges that may overlap with female home ranges, giving them access to a range of 3–15 females.

==Male-male competition==

Males compete for females using contest competition, scramble competition and sperm competition as mechanisms for sexual selection. The pre-copulatory mechanisms, including contest and scramble competition, are conditional mating tactics that are used based on an individual&#x27;s phenotype. Males that are larger in size compete more in physical contests to access potential mates, while males that are smaller or medium-sized use scramble competition as a strategy by increasing their ranges to encounter potential mates. Age and size are positively correlated and as males mature, they grow in size and experience, monopolizing receptive females. Observations of broken canines, cuts, wounds and scars demonstrate the costs associated with contests and the importance of physical intra-sexual conflict within polygamous mating systems.

There is also post-copulatory male-male competition that has been documented in species within the genus &quot;Ursus&quot;. The presence of dual paternity within a litter implies that sperm competition may take place after copulation.

Another male strategy observed by male bears is sexually selected infanticide. This results in males killing the offspring of other males to directly and indirectly improve their own reproductive success. This can directly influence their success by mating with the female when she re-enters oestrus or indirectly by lowering intra-sexual competition with other males and resources.

==Female mate choice==

Female choice is based on the cost of searching for a mate and the quality of a mate. Since females are induced ovulators, studies suggest that they may have control over the paternity of their offspring. This may be done through pre- and post-copulatory counter-strategies that involve cryptic female choice and sexually selected infanticide. The hypothesis of sexually selected infanticide is a female counterstrategy that can directly and indirectly improve their fitness. This is done by selecting for infanticidal males to enforce mate and offspring recognition and indirectly by mating with multiple males in order to have multiple paternity.

Within &quot;Ursus&quot;, there may be a high variation within the mating strategies observed by both females and males, demonstrating overall plasticity depending on external factors. This demonstrates the conditional mating tactics that male bears may consider based on their age and size, as well as the counter-strategies of females, including sexually selected infanticide and cryptic female choice.

== List of films with a plot based on dance ==

===Ballet===

* &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948) - Film classic with dance editing far ahead of its time. Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, starring Moira Shearer. Intricately weaving backstage life with the thrill of performance, this film centers on the dilemma of a young ballerina torn between the composer who loves her and the impresario determined to fashion her into a great dancer. 134 min, and based loosely on the fairytale.
* &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (1951) - Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, starring Moira Shearer and Ludmilla Tchérina. Film version of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s opera but making full use of film techniques and special effects. Not just a film of a stage production.

Both want what the other has and reflects back on missed chances as they are brought together again through Deedee&#x27;s daughter who joins the company. Starring: Shirley MacLaine, Anne Bancroft, Tom Skerrit, Anthony Zerbe, Leslie Browne, Mikhail Baryshnikov and Alexandra Danilova.

With the complete cooperation of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago, Robert Altman follows the stories of the dancers, whose professional and personal lives grow impossibly close, as they cope with the demands of a life in the ballet. Neve Campbell plays a gifted but conflicted company member on the verge of becoming a principal dancer at a fictional Chicago troupe, with Malcolm McDowell playing the company&#x27;s co-founder and artistic director, considered one of America&#x27;s most exciting choreographers. James Franco plays Campbell&#x27;s boyfriend and one of the few characters not involved in the world of dance.

She starts work in a trendy hip-hop club and teams up with a former hockey player as she continues to perfect her dance skills. This movie isn&#x27;t really a sequel to &#x27;Center Stage&#x27; [2000] as there&#x27;s no continuation or development of the original film&#x27;s story line, although a couple of the characters (dance teachers played by Peter Gallagher and Ethan Stiefel) from the first movie reappear in this one.
* &quot;Mao&#x27;s Last Dancer (film)&quot; (2009) - Based on the autobiography of Chinese dancer Li Cunxin, this movie tells the story of his selection from an impoverished rural village to train at Madame Mao&#x27;s Beijing Dance Academy.

<text>The entartistes were a Canadian satirical political group, active in the late 1990s and early 2000s, whose members threw cream pies at political and cultural figures whom the group deemed to be in need of public embarrassment. A member of the group, who identified himself only as Pope-Tart, told the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; in 1999 that the group&#x27;s core philosophy was &quot;You work for us. You can&#x27;t be too big for your britches or you&#x27;ll get a pie in the face.&quot;

==History==
The group was founded by several former members of the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, including François Gourd. They initially convened in 1995 to offer a $400 reward to anybody from across Canada who successfully pied Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, but after nobody accepted the offer at the time they began to plan their own pieings.

Other figures pied by the group included Jean Charest, Mario Dumont, Stéphane Dion, Allan Rock, Pierre Pettigrew, William Johnson, Pierre Bourque, Jean Doré, Jacques Parizeau, Bernard Landry and Jacques Duchesneau. Quebec politicians were the most common targets, although the group also pied Sylvester Stallone during a 1998 promotional tour.

The group also inspired other attempts at pieing by offshoot groups across Canada. After the group released an updated &quot;hit list&quot; of desired targets in 1999 which included Chrétien, media mogul Conrad Black and pop singer Céline Dion, Chrétien was successfully pied in 2000 by Evan Brown, a member of an offshoot group in Prince Edward Island which called itself the PEI Pie Brigade. Ralph Klein was pied in 2003 by Alberta resident Christopher Geoghegan.

==Criminal charges==
While some figures pied by the group accepted the embarrassment in good humour, several others filed charges of assault against the pie-throwers.

Bruno Caron, who had pied Parizeau, faced criminal charges in 1999. He pleaded guilty in 2000, and was sentenced to 60 hours of community service.

Stéphane Dion also pressed charges against the group after his pieing, resulting in convictions of assault against group members Patrick Robert and Benoit Foisy. Both were sentenced to 60 hours of community service. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; subsequently identified Robert as the formerly anonymous group spokesman &quot;Pope-Tart&quot;.

Geoghegan was found guilty of assault against Klein in 2004, and sentenced to 60 days of jail time to be served on weekends, 40 hours of community service and three months&#x27; probation.

Evan Brown, who pied Jean Chrétien, was found guilty of assault and sentenced to 30 days of jail time, and ordered to contribute $50 toward a victims&#x27; compensation fund. The shame from the experience led Brown to quit his acting career and move to Halifax, Nova Scotia to become a theater technician, later writing a one-man show about the experience.

<text>In American folklore, the Golden Bear was a large golden &quot;Ursus arctos&quot;. Members of the &quot;Ursus arctos&quot; (brown bear) species can reach masses of . The grizzly bear (&quot;Ursus arctos horribilis&quot;) and the Kodiak bear are North American subspecies of the brown bear.

A great &quot;Golden Bear&quot; was reported in the area of Turner, Kansas. According to John Gardiner in 1831, it was feared and admired by the local Indigenous population. The bear lived south of the river in the hills west of the Methodist Mission. According to legend, it was the largest bear that any of the natives had ever seen. It would raid the settlements in the area and it feasted on the animals owned by the local population (the Shawnee tribe). Many of the Indians wanted to kill the bear for the pride of such a feat and for the capture of its hide (the fur was most sought after). The &quot;Golden Bear&quot; was seen several times by the ferry crew on the Old Grinter Ferry during the 1830s and 1840s. Both the Shawnee and the Wyandot tribes gathered a hunting party, but were unsuccessful in tracking the bear down.

The &quot;Golden Bear&quot; became the mascot for Turner High School and was adopted by the community in 1886. Two members of the community, Warren Hewitt and Jule Gaignet, submitted the icon and it won the majority of support in a contest. Reportedly, the two youths had heard of the bear from stories told by their grandparents. This icon is based on legends of that golden bear.

Western New England University adopted the Golden Bear as its mascot in the early 1950s.

Paul C. Schulte High School in Terre Haute, Indiana adopted the Golden Bear as its mascot in 1953.

Upper Arlington High School in Columbus, Ohio, was dedicated in 1956 and made the Golden Bear its mascot. Coincidentally, professional golfer Jack &quot;The Golden Bear&quot; Nicklaus graduated from Upper Arlington High School in 1957. His nickname was coined in 1967 by Australian sportswriter Don Lawrence, who thought that Nicklaus looked like a &quot;big, cuddly, golden bear.&quot; Jennifer &quot;Mama Bear&quot; D&#x27;Orsi (Simcic) is also a graduate of Upper Arlington High School.

University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta also has the Golden Bear as its mascot.

Bartlett High School in Anchorage, Alaska adopted the Golden Bear as its mascot upon opening its doors as Bartlett-Begich Jr/Sr High in 1973. Also, Billings Montana West High.

Sierra Pacific High School In Hanford, California adopted the Golden Bear as its mascot when it opened in 2009.

Stratford District Secondary School adopted the Golden Bear as its mascot when it opened in 2020.

Students and sports teams from the University of California at Berkeley call themselves Golden Bears. Their mascot is Oski the Bear.
