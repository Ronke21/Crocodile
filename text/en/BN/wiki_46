<text>Grace Aguilar (2 June 1816 – 16 September 1847) was an English novelist, poet and writer on Jewish history and religion. Although she had been writing since childhood, much of her work was published posthumously. Among those are her best known works, the novels &quot;Home Influence&quot; and &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Recompense&quot;.

Aguilar was the eldest child of Sephardic Jewish refugees from Portugal who settled in the London Borough of Hackney. An early illness resulted in her being educated by her parents, especially her mother, who taught her the tenets of Judaism. Later, her father taught the history of Spanish and Portuguese Jews during his own bout with tuberculosis which had led the family to move to the English coast. After surviving the measles at the age of 19, she began to embark on a serious writing career, even though her physical health never completely recovered.

Aguilar&#x27;s debut was an anonymous collection of poems, &quot;The Magic Wreath of Hidden Flowers&quot;. Three years later she translated Isaac Orobio de Castro&#x27;s &quot;Israel Defended&quot; into English at her father&#x27;s behest. Later her &quot;The Spirit of Judaism&quot; drew interest and sales in both Britain and the United States after being published in Philadelphia by Isaac Leeser. He added a preface to the work elucidating his differences with her, the first of many clashes her work would have with mainstream Jewish thought.

In the 1840s her novels began to attract regular readers, and Aguilar moved back to London with her parents. Despite her success, she and her mother still had to operate a boys&#x27; Hebrew school to stay solvent, which she resented for the time and energy it took from her writing. In 1847, she became ill again with a spinal paralysis which she did not let prevent her from visiting her brother in Frankfurt. Her health worsened and she died there that September.

== Biography ==
=== Childhood ===
Grace Aguilar was born in the northeast London suburb of Hackney, London, on 2 June 1816. She was the oldest child of her parents, who were both descended from Portuguese Jews. Her family settled in Jamaica and eventually in England in the 18th century following the Portuguese Inquisition. Emanuel, her father, was the lay leader of London&#x27;s Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, and her mother Sarah was active in the city&#x27;s Jewish community as well. Her religious background and illnesses, both hers and her parents&#x27;, were major factors in her life and influential on her work.

=== Illness and education ===

For her first eight years, Aguilar was an only child. During this time, Aguilar suffered from a chronic long-term illness that led her parents to educate her at home. She was tutored in the classics at home and (even in adulthood) was not permitted to move outside of her family circle. Her mother, in keeping with post-Inquisition practice among Sephardic Jews from the Iberian Peninsula, educated the young Aguilar in her religion and its tenets. Her condition did not stop her from learning to dance and play the harp and piano, common pursuits for middle-class English girls of that era, or traveling. After her brother Emanuel was born in 1823 the family went on an extended tour of Gloucestershire.

When Aguilar&#x27;s father contracted tuberculosis, the family moved to Devon. While Grace was taking care of him, her father taught her the oral history of the Jews of Spain and Portugal, complementing her mother&#x27;s earlier instruction in Judaism. He may also have taught her Hebrew, which was extremely unusual for a Jewish woman to know at that time. Both her religious and literary interests date to that time of her life; she began indulging them both by making her first efforts at poetry and fiction and attending some Protestant services. A collection of conch shells she found on a Teignmouth beach spurred her to attempt a scientific paper on the subject.

Sarah Aguilar&#x27;s health took a turn for the worse during this period, as she recovered from surgical treatment for an illness that has not yet been identified from the records available, and Grace spent time taking care of her as she had her father. In 1835, at the age of 19, Grace was again taken ill herself, with measles. She never completely recovered.

=== Writing career ===
The family moved to Brighton afterwards, perhaps to be closer to London&#x27;s Jewish community. The two Aguilar boys had been sent to boarding school, but with her parents&#x27; health declining, Grace began to think about her responsibilities to not only them but her brothers as well. She decided to try making a living as a writer, and that year was able to get her first book of poems published. Her first book was successful enough that a second run was printed in 1839, and she began writing in earnest.

Much of this work was published posthumously, with one exception. In 1838 Aguilar&#x27;s father prevailed upon her to translate Isaac Orobio de Castro&#x27;s &quot;Israel Defended&quot;, an apologia for Judaism, from the original French for private distribution among Brighton&#x27;s Jewish community. She added a preface that, albeit with some ambivalence, explained that she had softened Orobio&#x27;s castigations of Christians as a result of the tolerance she felt Victorian England had shown to its Jewish population compared with Catholic Spain and Portugal. Two years later the family returned to London.

There, Aguilar befriended the young Benjamin Disraeli, whose father Isaac was a well-known author. The older man was able to help her find a publisher. He declined, but on her own she was able to persuade Isaac Leeser, editor of &quot;The Occident&quot;, an American Jewish magazine, to publish her theological tract &quot;The Spirit of Judaism&quot; as the initial volume of a new series of books he was bringing out. The original manuscript was lost at sea, but Aguilar was able to recreate it from her notes, and it was published in 1842. When she received her copy, Aguilar was angry that Leeser had added a preface detailing his differences of opinion with Aguilar.

The book was nevertheless well-received, and Aguilar began publishing poems in small English journals. Isaac D&#x27;Israeli now chose to help her, possibly introducing her to Edward Moxon, his own publisher. Moxon in turn introduced her to R. Groombridge &amp; Sons, the large publisher that would eventually bring out most of her work in Britain.

Despite her anger over the preface he added to &quot;The Spirit of Judaism&quot;, Aguilar continued to publish her poetry in Leeser&#x27;s journals. She befriended Solomon Cohen, the first Jewish state senator in Georgia and his wife Miriam, which contributed to the success of her work in the South as they distributed her books widely there. In England, her domestic fiction drew readers and acclaim. However, she still needed to run a boys&#x27; Hebrew school with her mother to make enough money to live on, an obligation she complained about bitterly and repeatedly in her letters to Miriam Cohen, since she felt it took away from the time she had to write. She also anguished over the fate of her brother Henry, who had chosen a career as a sailor.

The last years of her life were busy. In 1841 she joined with Charlotte Montefiore writing the periodical &quot;The Cheap Jewish Library, Dedicated to the Working Classes&quot;, which has been described as &quot;providing a context in which female authors corresponded and encouraged one another in publication, and thus [...] contributing to the beginnings of a Jewish women&#x27;s movement in England.&quot; Aguilar turned to nonfiction, producing &quot;Women of Israel&quot;, an account of the lives of Jewish women that was recognized as her masterpiece. In 1845, the family was able to move again, to a house on Hackney&#x27;s Clapton Square, where she tended to her father until his death the following year.

=== Last years and death ===

In 1847 Aguilar came down with a spinal paralysis; in spite of the illness she went ahead with a planned trip to Europe. Before her departure some Jewish women of London presented her with a gift and an address recounting her achievements in behalf of Judaism and Jewish women. She later visited Emanuel at Frankfurt, where he had become a successful musician. At first she seemed to benefit by the change of scene and climate, but after a few weeks she went to the baths of Schwalbach for treatment. More symptoms led her return to Frankfurt, where she died on 16 September 1847. Aguilar was buried at the Frankfurt Jewish cemetery in Hessen, Germany. The epitaph of her tombstone was taken from Proverbs 31, the section of the biblical work on the &quot;woman of valor&quot;:&quot;Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her at the gate&quot;.

==Literary works==

Aguilar&#x27;s literary career began with the diary she started at seven and continued, uninterrupted, until her death. Before she was twelve she had written a drama, &quot;Gustavus Vasa&quot;, which has since been lost. Her first verses were evoked two years later by the scenery about Tavistock in Devonshire. Her early collected poems, under the title &quot;The Magic Wreath of Hidden Flowers&quot;, were published anonymously in 1835; each is a riddle with clues to the name of a particular flower.

Aguilar&#x27;s productions are chiefly stories and religious works dealing with Jewish subjects. The former embrace domestic tales, tales founded on Marano history, and a romance of Scottish history, &quot;The Days of Bruce&quot; (1852). The most popular of the Jewish tales is &quot;The Vale of Cedars, or the Martyr: A Story of Spain in the Fifteenth Century&quot;, written before 1835, published in 1850, and twice translated into German and twice into Hebrew. Her other stories founded on Jewish episodes are included in a collection of nineteen tales, &quot;Home Scenes and Heart Studies&quot; (published posthumously 1852); &quot;The Perez Family&quot; (1843) and &quot;The Edict&quot; together with &quot;The Escape&quot;, had appeared as two separate volumes; the others were reprinted from magazines. Her domestic tales are &quot;Home Influence&quot; (1847) and its sequel, &quot;The Mother&#x27;s Recompense&quot; (1851), both of them written early in 1836, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Friendship&quot; (1851), and &quot;Helon: A Fragment from Jewish History&quot; (1852).

The first of Aguilar&#x27;s religious works was a translation of the French version of &quot;Israel Defended,&quot; by the Marrano Orobio de Castro, printed for private circulation. It was closely followed by &quot;The Spirit of Judaism,&quot; the publication of which was for a time prevented by the loss of the original manuscript. Sermons by Rabbi Isaac Leeser, of Philadelphia, had fallen into her hands and, like all other accessible Jewish works, had been eagerly read. She requested him to revise the manuscript of the &quot;Spirit of Judaism&quot;, which was forwarded to him, but was lost. The author rewrote it; and in 1842 it was published in Philadelphia, with notes by Leeser. A second edition was issued in 1849 by the first American Jewish Publication Society; and a third (Cincinnati, 1864) has an appendix containing thirty-two poems (bearing date 1838-1847), all but two reprinted from &quot;The Occident&quot;. The editor&#x27;s notes serve mainly to mark dissent from Aguilar&#x27;s depreciation of Jewish tradition – due probably to her Marrano ancestry and to her country life, cut off from association with Jews. In 1845 &quot;The Women of Israel&quot; appeared—a series of portraits delineated according to the Scriptures and Josephus. This was soon followed by &quot;The Jewish Faith: Its Spiritual Consolation, Moral Guidance, and Immortal Hope,&quot; in thirty-one letters, the last dated September, 1846. Of this work—addressed to a Jewess under the spell of Christian influence, to demonstrate to her the spirituality of Judaism—the larger part is devoted to immortality in the Old Testament. Aguilar&#x27;s other religious writings —some of them written as early as 1836—were collected in a volume of &quot;Essays and Miscellanies&quot; (1851–52). The first part consists of &quot;Sabbath Thoughts&quot; on Scriptural passages and prophecies; the second, of &quot;Communings&quot; for the family circle.

In her religious writings Aguilar&#x27;s attitude was defensive. Despite her almost exclusive intercourse with Christians and her utter lack of prejudice, her purpose, apparently, was to equip English Jewish women with arguments against conversionists. She inveighed against formalism, and laid stress upon knowledge of Jewish history and the Hebrew language. In view of the neglect of the latter by women (to whom she modestly confined her expostulations), she constantly pleaded for the reading of the Scriptures in the English version. Her interest in the reform movement was deep; yet, despite her attitude toward tradition, she observed ritual ordinances punctiliously. Her last work was a sketch of the &quot;History of the Jews in England&quot;, written for &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Miscellany.&quot; In point of style it is the most finished of her productions, free from the exuberances and redundancies that disfigure the tales—published, for the most part, posthumously by her mother. The defects of her style are mainly chargeable to youth. With her extraordinary industry—she rose early and employed the day systematically—and her growing ability of concentration she gave promise of noteworthy productions.

<doc id="435140" wikidata="Q3544263" url="?curid=435140" title="USS Robalo">
<text>USS &quot;Robalo&quot; (SS-273), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the róbalo or common snook.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Robalo&quot;′s keel was laid down on 24 October 1942 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at [Manitowoc, Wisconsin. She was launched on 9 May 1943, sponsored by Mrs. E. S. Root, and commissioned on 28 September 1943.

==First patrol==
After passage by inland waterways and being floated down the Mississippi River, &quot;Robalo&quot; deployed to the Pacific. On her first war patrol (under the leadership of Commander Stephen Ambruster, Annapolis class of 1928), she sortied from Pearl Harbor, hunting Japanese ships west of the Philippines. On 12 February 1944, Armbruster reported seeing a large, two-masted sailboat. There, &quot;en route&quot; to her new station in Fremantle submarine base, Western Australia, she had an encounter with enemy vessels; on 13 February 1944 east of the Verde Island Passage, the &quot;Robalo&quot; had come across a convoy of two large ships escorted by a minesweeper, which dropped 13 depth charges and fired twice at the submarine with a deck gun; although USS &quot;Robalo&quot; is &quot;credited&quot; with damaging a large freighter, firing four torpedoes at , in fact the attack was unsuccessful and no enemy vessels were damaged or sunk. She spent 36 of her 57-day mission submerged. When she arrived, her commanding officer was summarily relieved by Admiral Christie and replaced with Manning Kimmel (class of 1935).

In March 1944, Christie (based on Ultra intelligence) feared surprise from a strong Japanese force. When Chester W. Nimitz, Jr. in , made contact on his SJ radar and reported &quot;many large ships&quot;, Christie scrambled to respond. &quot;Robalo&quot;, along with , , , and , all ran to intercept. No attack ever materialized.

==Second patrol==
For her second patrol, &quot;Robalo&quot; went to the South China Sea, assigned to interdict Japanese tanker traffic from French Indochina to the fleet anchorage at Tawi Tawi. On 24 April 1944 off Indochina, she was bombed by a Japanese antisubmarine aircraft, suffering shattered and flooded periscopes and loss of radar, while taking a harrowing plunge to after her main induction valve was improperly closed (a casualty frighteningly reminiscent of &quot;Squalus&quot;) in diving to escape. &quot;Robalo&quot; had been seen by Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Kaiyō&quot; while escorting convoy Hi-58, which resulted in &quot;Robalo&quot; being damaged 24 April 1944. One of the ships that escaped damage from &quot;Robalo&quot; was the &quot;Mayasan Maru&quot;. On a &quot;wildly aggressive patrol&quot; lasting 51 days, &quot;Robalo&quot; fired 20 torpedoes in four attacks. In regard to the four claims by &quot;Robalo&quot;, on 3 May 1944, six torpedoes against a 4000-ton freighter (no damage); 8 May 1944, four torpedoes against a 1900-ton submarine (no damage); 17 May 1944, six torpedoes against a 7500-ton tanker (one hit) and four torpedoes against a 1500-ton destroyer (no damage). She was credited with sinking a 7500-ton tanker, which was not confirmed postwar by JANAC. When she returned to Fremantle, Captain &quot;Tex&quot; McLean (commanding Subron 16) and Admiral Christie both considered relieving &quot;Robalo&quot;″s skipper for his own safety.

==Third patrol==
&quot;Robalo&quot; departed Fremantle on 22 June 1944 on her third war patrol. She set a course for the South China Sea to conduct her patrol in the vicinity of the Natuna Islands. After transiting Makassar Strait and Balabac Strait (which was well-known to be mined), she was scheduled to arrive on station about 6 July and remain until dark on 2 August 1944. On 2 July, a contact report stated &quot;Robalo&quot; had sighted a &quot;Fusō&quot;-class battleship, with air cover and two destroyers for escort, just east of Borneo. No other messages were ever received from the submarine, and when she did not return from patrol, she was presumed lost.

&quot;Robalo&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 September 1944.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Robalo&quot; earned two battle stars for World War II service.

==Fate of survivors==
On 2 August, a note was handed from the cell window of the Kempei Tai military prison on Palawan Island in the Philippines, to Ed Petry, an American prisoner-of-war from the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp who was passing by. The note was, in turn, given to Yeoman Second Class Hubert D. Hough, who was also a prisoner at the camp. He contacted Trinidad Mendoza (Red Hankie), wife of guerrilla leader Dr. Mendoza, who had the Coastwatchers radio General MacArthur and Admiral Ralph Christie in Australia.

From these sources, it was concluded &quot;Robalo&quot; was sunk on 26 July 1944, off the western coast of Palawan Island from an explosion in the vicinity of her after battery, probably caused by an enemy mine. Four men swam ashore and made their way through the jungles to a small barrier northwest of the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp, where Japanese Military Police captured them and jailed them for guerrilla activities. On 15 August, they were evacuated by a Japanese destroyer and never heard from again. The exact fate of the survivors is unknown.

Though Admiral Christie knew better, for morale reasons, all hands were reported as having gone down with the boat, but other prisoners on Palawan reported that the boat&#x27;s skipper, Lieutenant Commander Manning Kimmel, son of Admiral Husband Kimmel, was one of the survivors. After an air strike on Palawan, the Japanese were so angered that they pushed Kimmel and the other prisoners into a ditch, poured in gasoline, and burned them alive. This incident was reported by Clay Blair Jr., a submarine veteran of the war and author of the definitive work &quot;Silent Victory: The US Submarine War Against Japan&quot; (see Volume 2, pp660–662 for details).

==Discovery==
The wreckage of the &quot;Robalo&quot; was found by the Sea Scan Survey Team in May 2019 in the Balabac Strait off the east coast of Balabac Island at a depth of . Her identity was confirmed by the U. S. Navy.

<text>A spur route is a short road forming a branch from a longer, more important road such as a freeway, Interstate Highway, or motorway. A bypass or beltway is not considered a spur route as it typically reconnects with another or the same major road.

== Canada ==

In the province of Ontario, most spur routes are designated as A or B, such as Highway 17A, or 7B. A stands for &quot;Alternate Route&quot;, and usually links a highway to a town&#x27;s central core or main attraction, while B stands for &quot;Business Route&quot; or &quot;Bypass&quot;, but are used when a main highway is routed around a town and away from its former alignment. The designation of &quot;C&quot; was used twice (Highway 3C and 40C), and is assumed to mean &quot;Connector&quot;. Both highways have long since been retired and are now county roads. There was also one road with the D designation (Highway 8D, later the original Highway 102), and this may have stood for &quot;Diversion&quot;, as it was along the first completed divided highway in Canada at the time (Cootes Drive in Hamilton).

== India ==
The Indian National Highway system designates spur routes of the main National Highways with letter suffixes. For example, National Highway 1 has four spur routes: NH 1A, NH 1B, NH 1C, and NH 1D, the shortest of which is just in length (NH 1C) and the longest is (NH 1A). While the spur routes essentially originate at the parent National Highway, they are not merely secondary in status as some of the spur routes serve important cities in India. For example, Srinagar, the capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, is served by the spur route NH 1A. Some spur routes are specifically used to connect important Indian ports: NH 5A links Paradip with its parent NH 5 and NH 7A links Tuticorin with NH 7).

==Italy==

The acronym RA stands for &quot;Raccordo autostradale&quot; (translated as &quot;motorway connection&quot;), a relatively short spur route that connects an &quot;autostrada&quot; (Italian for motorway) to a nearby city or tourist resort not directly served by the motorway. These spurs are owned and managed by Anas. Some spurs are toll-free motorways (type-A), but most are type-B or type-C roads. All RA have separate carriageways with two lanes in each direction. Generally, they do not have an emergency lane.

==Japan==

In Japan, spurs of its expressways are usually designated with an added letter &quot;A&quot;. This designation applies to all routes that are part of a &quot;family&quot; of routes with the &quot;parent&quot; route lacking the added &quot;A&quot;. Examples of spur routes in the system include the Aomori Expressway (E4A), linking the Tōhoku Expressway (E4) to the eastern limits of Aomori, and the Sasson Expressway (E5A), linking the Dō-Ō Expressway (E5) to Otaru; however, some expressways that lack the &quot;A&quot; designation could also be considered spurs, such as the Kansai-Kūkō Expressway (E71) or the Ōita Airport Road (E97).

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, spurs on state highways are usually designated with an added letter. Examples include SH 2B, linking SH 2 to Napier Airport, and SH 6A, linking SH 6 with Queenstown town center. Not all such alphabetic suffixes refer to spurs, however; ring roads and linking roads between highways are also so designated. Conversely, some State Highways could themselves be considered spurs, notably SH 78, New Zealand&#x27;s shortest state highway, which links SH 1 in Timaru city center with the Port of Timaru.

Such spurs and spur roads leading from smaller urban thoroughfares to individual facilities are often referred to in New Zealand as &quot;feeder roads&quot;.

==Romania==
All national roads, local roads and county roads have spur routes.
A good example is DN1 and DN1A. 
DN1A goes from Bucharest to Brașov via Buftea, and have an intersection with DN1 at Ploiești.
After Ploiești, DN1A goes to Vălenii de Munte, Cheia, and then DN1A goes directly onto the Brașov.

== United Kingdom ==
In the UK, a spur route carries the same definition, but the numbering rules differ.

=== Same-number spurs ===
Short spurs from primary roads or motorways typically are not given a unique number, and three arms of the junction will apparently have the same number. For example, the A14 has a same-number spur to the A1(M) motorway at Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, the M23 motorway has one to Gatwick Airport in West Sussex and the M4 has one to Heathrow Airport. To distinguish the spur on road signs, the road it leads to is usually given - for example &quot;Gatwick Airport (A23)&quot;.

=== Unique-number spurs ===
Typically, slightly longer spurs, or those with intermediate junctions of their own, are given unique numbers to distinguish them from their parent road, for example, the A48(M) motorway, a spur of the M4. There is a loose numbering system for these spurs on the motorway network, not dissimilar to the US system – the road takes a three-digit number derived from that of the parent road. Examples include the M602 motorway (spur of the M60 and M62 motorways), M621 motorway (spur of the M62 and M1 motorways), and M271 motorway (spur of the M27 motorway). There are anomalous spur numbers though, for instance the M898 motorway (spur of the M8 motorway; number given to match with a unique A-number road) and the unique case of the M181 motorway, a spur of a spur M180 motorway, and that of the M18 motorway

A-road spurs do not follow a noticeable numbering system; they would be impossible to assign due to the quantity of A-road numbers in use.

== United States ==

In the US, many Interstate Highways have spur routes when they enter a large metropolitan area. Interstate spur routes are numbered with a three-digit number. The last two digits of the number are the number of the &quot;parent&quot; Interstate (Interstate 238, which connects Interstate 880 with Interstate 580 near Hayward, CA, is the only exception to this); e.g. a spur route of Interstate 90 could be 990; a spur route of Interstate 5 could be 105.

Spur Interstate routes have three-digit numbers with an odd first digit. A subsidiary route either passing through a city or bypassing it and then reconnecting to a major highway would receive an even first digit, and be considered a loop rather than a spur. For example, in the case of Interstate 5, Interstate 105 is a spur route ending at Los Angeles International Airport, whereas Interstate 405 begins and ends at Interstate 5, bypassing downtown Los Angeles.

Spurs are also found branching from US highways, state routes, and county routes, often as extended onramps and offramps of expressways.

There are many numbering violations in the spur route numbering system, thus the general rules above do not always apply (e.g. U.S. Route 400—there is no parent &quot;route 0&quot;).

<text>Charles Jerry Vines (born September 1937) is an American preacher and former pastor of what was then the nation&#x27;s third largest Southern Baptist church, the First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Florida. Like his former co-pastor Homer G. Lindsay Jr., Vines is well known for his conservative and sometimes controversial public stances, as well as his wide-reaching influence in the Southern Baptist Convention and the local political arena. He retired from the First Baptist pulpit on February 7, 2006, and was succeeded by Mac Brunson. On February 4, 2007, Brunson named Vines Pastor Emeritus of the church.

==Biography==
Jerry Vines was born in Carrollton, Georgia near Atlanta in 1937. Before attending seminary, he pastored his first church, Centralhatchee Baptist Church, at the age of 16. He was educated at Mercer University, New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, and Luther Rice University before pastoring in churches in Alabama and Georgia. While pastor of Dauphin Way Baptist Church in Mobile, Alabama he was elected President of the Alabama Pastors&#x27; Conference. He relocated to Jacksonville in 1982 to co-pastor the First Baptist Church with Homer G. Lindsay Jr.

In June 1988, he was elected president of the Southern Baptist Convention, served two terms, and was supportive of the Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence. During his first 20 years at First Baptist Jacksonville, he baptized 18,177 people and oversaw the building of an $8 million preschool building, a $16 million auditorium and four parking garages, totaling almost $14 million. Vines also was influential in starting the First Baptist Church Pastors&#x27; Conference which drew thousands of ministers and church works from across the world. Vines announced his retirement from First Baptist in May 2005 and preached his last sermon as pastor of the church in 2006 at the close of the 20th annual Pastors&#x27; conference. In 2017, Vines enrolled in the Ph.D program at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, TX.

He has since started his own ministry, Jerry Vines Ministries. This ministry is an outreach to further educate pastors in different areas of the ministry. Vines is married to the former Janet Denney and they have four children and seven grand children.

==Controversy==
Vines sparked controversy in June 2002 for remarks he made at a Southern Baptist Convention conference that were critical of Islam and Muhammad. Referencing Ergun and Emir Caner&#x27;s book &quot;Unveiling Islam&quot;, Vines said that &quot;Allah is not Jehovah… Jehovah&#x27;s not going to turn you into a terrorist that&#x27;ll try to bomb people and take the lives of thousands and thousands of people,&quot; and that &quot;Christianity was founded by the virgin-born Jesus Christ&quot; while &quot;Islam was founded by Muhammad, a demon-possessed pedophile who had 12 wives, and his last one was a 9-year-old girl.&quot; This reference was to Aisha, who is said to have been married to Muhammad when she was six years old and about nine when her marriage to Muhammad was consummated, according to several &quot;hadith&quot; or Islamic accounts of the life of Muhammad. The comments stirred a brief national debate on &quot;Islamophobia&quot; and the demonization of Islam in relation to the War on Terrorism. Vines initially defended his comments and invited &quot;Muslim scholars to explain their own documents to us all.&quot; He also refused to apologize for the statements or to meet with local Muslim leaders. He was heavily criticized, but was defended by fellow Baptist preacher Jerry Falwell, who wrote a letter supporting him. Falwell was asked about the letter during a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview in October, and sparked an even greater outrage by declaring that he considered Muhammad a terrorist. He later apologized for his comments. When the story was covered by &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; with Tom Brokaw on February 25, 2003, Vines finally broke his silence on the issue, claiming that his statements had been overemphasized in media reports, and that he had not intended to evoke hate.

Jerry Vines was found to have covered up allegations of abuse by Darrell Gilyard towards young women with Paige Patterson from 1991. One of several young women, abused by Gilyard, said she reported her abuse to Vines, who was reported to have responded by asking her to stay silent as &quot;it may be embarrassing for her [the abused]&quot;. He allegedly spoke to Paige Patterson and no police action was undertaken into the claims.

<text>The First Baptist Church of Jacksonville is a Baptist megachurch in Downtown Jacksonville, Florida, U.S.. It is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. As of 2023, First Baptist Church has 2,100 members and an average attendance of around 3,000 for Sunday services. The main Downtown Campus comprises several square blocks of property connected by above-ground crosswalks. The campus includes several auditoriums for services, a Sunday school building, and facilities for First Baptist Academy, a private K-12 school.

First Baptist Church has its origins in the oldest Baptist congregation in Jacksonville, Bethel Baptist Church, established in 1838. The church experienced a period of considerable growth in the mid-20th century, eventually encompassing eleven square blocks of downtown Jacksonville. Several former pastors, including Homer G. Lindsay Jr. and Jerry Vines, were widely influential in the Southern Baptist Convention, leading it in both growth and a shift towards conservatism.

==History==
===Early years===
First Baptist Church traces its origins to Bethel Baptist Church (now Bethel Baptist Institutional Church), the earliest Baptist church to be founded in Jacksonville. Bethel Baptist was established under co-pastors James McDonald and Ryan Frier in July 1838 with only six charter members, four whites and two blacks, the latter of whom were slaves of white members. Membership quickly grew, with most early congregants being black slaves who received day passes from their masters to attend. The first meetings were held at &quot;Mother Sam&#x27;s&quot;, a local plantation, and in 1861 a permanent meeting hall was erected in Downtown Jacksonville at Church and Julia Streets. The Bethel Baptist Church remained interracial until after the American Civil War, at which point the decision was made to segregate the congregation by race. White members attempted to force out the blacks, and took their case to court. However, the court found in favor of the blacks, who were in the majority, determining that they were the rightful owners of the Bethel Baptist name and property. As a result the whites left the congregation, forming Tabernacle Baptist Church, which was eventually renamed First Baptist Church.

In 1866, Tabernacle Baptist Church purchased the Church Street property from Bethel Baptist Church, as was required by the court. The church went through a number of changes over the next years, and in 1892 it moved to its current location between Church and Hogan Streets, adopting the name First Baptist Church. W.A. Hobson became pastor in May 1900 who served for 23 years. The building was entirely destroyed in the Great Fire of 1901, which ravaged downtown Jacksonville. In 1903, the foundation was laid for a new building, which was completed within a year. This building, now known as Hobson Auditorium, still serves as part of the larger First Baptist complex. Len G. Broughton served as the next pastor of the church from 1923 to 1927.

===20th century to present===
The church did not fare well in the early 20th century. By 1940, First Baptist had accumulated a debt of $125,000 and saw its educational building repossessed by its creditors. That year, the church hired Homer Lindsay Sr. as their senior pastor. Under his leadership the church reversed its fortunes, and within a few years it paid off its debt, acquired a new education building, and grew its congregation. In 1969 First Baptist hired Lindsay&#x27;s son, Homer G. Lindsay Jr., as co-pastor; he took over sole pastoral duties upon his father&#x27;s retirement in 1975. Under Lindsay Jr. the church experienced even faster growth, emerging as a megachurch with thousands of members and many new buildings, including a new 3,500-seat auditorium.

Jerry Vines joined Lindsay as co-pastor in 1982. First Baptist grew even further, becoming a major power in the Southern Baptist Convention and adding a 10,000-seat auditorium in 1993. Vines became a key leader in the growing Convention and was a major figure in its shift toward strict conservatism. Vines and First Baptist Church received national attention in June 2002 for Vines&#x27; controversial statements regarding Islam. Lindsay died in 2000 and Vines retired in 2006; Mac Brunson was hired as senior pastor that year. Recent developments include the establishment of First Baptist Academy and of a satellite campus of the church in neighboring St. Johns County. Heath Lambert is the current senior pastor.

In 2012, Bethel Baptist Church and First Baptist had a joint service, celebrating their 160th anniversary. A second campus was established in Nocatee, Florida First Baptist Church&#x27;s attendance and influence has been declining for the past 20 years.

<doc id="435161" wikidata="Q527863" url="?curid=435161" title="Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture">
<text>In mathematics, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture (often called the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture) describes the set of rational solutions to equations defining an elliptic curve. It is an open problem in the field of number theory and is widely recognized as one of the most challenging mathematical problems. It is named after mathematicians Bryan John Birch and Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, who developed the conjecture during the first half of the 1960s with the help of machine computation. Only special cases of the conjecture have been proven.

The modern formulation of the conjecture relates to arithmetic data associated with an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; over a number field &quot;K&quot; to the behaviour of the Hasse–Weil &quot;L&quot;-function &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) of &quot;E&quot; at &quot;s&quot; = 1. More specifically, it is conjectured that the rank of the abelian group &quot;E&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) of points of &quot;E&quot; is the order of the zero of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) at &quot;s&quot; = 1. The first non-zero coefficient in the Taylor expansion of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) at &quot;s&quot; = 1 is given by more refined arithmetic data attached to &quot;E&quot; over &quot;K&quot; .

The conjecture was chosen as one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems listed by the Clay Mathematics Institute, which has offered a $1,000,000 prize for the first correct proof.

== Background ==
 proved Mordell&#x27;s theorem: the group of rational points on an elliptic curve has a finite basis. This means that for any elliptic curve there is a finite subset of the rational points on the curve, from which all further rational points may be generated.

If the number of rational points on a curve is infinite then some point in a finite basis must have infinite order. The number of &quot;independent&quot; basis points with infinite order is called the rank of the curve, and is an important invariant property of an elliptic curve.

If the rank of an elliptic curve is 0, then the curve has only a finite number of rational points. On the other hand, if the rank of the curve is greater than 0, then the curve has an infinite number of rational points.

Although Mordell&#x27;s theorem shows that the rank of an elliptic curve is always finite, it does not give an effective method for calculating the rank of every curve. The rank of certain elliptic curves can be calculated using numerical methods but (in the current state of knowledge) it is unknown if these methods handle all curves.

An &quot;L&quot;-function &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) can be defined for an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; by constructing an Euler product from the number of points on the curve modulo each prime &quot;p&quot;. This &quot;L&quot;-function is analogous to the Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet L-series that is defined for a binary quadratic form. It is a special case of a Hasse–Weil L-function.

The natural definition of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) only converges for values of &quot;s&quot; in the complex plane with Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 3/2. Helmut Hasse conjectured that &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) could be extended by analytic continuation to the whole complex plane. This conjecture was first proved by for elliptic curves with complex multiplication. It was subsequently shown to be true for all elliptic curves over Q, as a consequence of the modularity theorem in 2001.

Finding rational points on a general elliptic curve is a difficult problem. Finding the points on an elliptic curve modulo a given prime &quot;p&quot; is conceptually straightforward, as there are only a finite number of possibilities to check. However, for large primes it is computationally intensive.

== History ==

In the early 1960s Peter Swinnerton-Dyer used the EDSAC-2 computer at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory to calculate the number of points modulo &quot;p&quot; (denoted by &quot;Np&quot;) for a large number of primes &quot;p&quot; on elliptic curves whose rank was known. From these numerical results conjectured that &quot;Np&quot; for a curve &quot;E&quot; with rank &quot;r&quot; obeys an asymptotic law

:formula_1

where &quot;C&quot; is a constant.

Initially, this was based on somewhat tenuous trends in graphical plots; this induced a measure of skepticism in J. W. S. Cassels (Birch&#x27;s Ph.D. advisor). Over time the numerical evidence stacked up.

This in turn led them to make a general conjecture about the behavior of a curve&#x27;s L-function &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) at &quot;s&quot; = 1, namely that it would have a zero of order &quot;r&quot; at this point. This was a far-sighted conjecture for the time, given that the analytic continuation of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) was only established for curves with complex multiplication, which were also the main source of numerical examples. (NB that the reciprocal of the L-function is from some points of view a more natural object of study; on occasion, this means that one should consider poles rather than zeroes.)

The conjecture was subsequently extended to include the prediction of the precise leading Taylor coefficient of the &quot;L&quot;-function at &quot;s&quot; = 1. It is conjecturally given by

:formula_2

where the quantities on the right-hand side are invariants of the curve, studied by Cassels, Tate, Shafarevich and others :

formula_3 is the order of the torsion group,

formula_4 is the order of the Tate–Shafarevich group,

formula_5 is the real period of &quot;E&quot; multiplied by the number of connected components of &quot;E&quot;,

formula_6 is the regulator of &quot;E&quot; which is defined via the canonical heights of a basis of rational points,

formula_7 is the Tamagawa number of &quot;E&quot; at a prime &quot;p&quot; dividing the conductor &quot;N&quot; of &quot;E&quot;. It can be found by Tate&#x27;s algorithm.

At the time of the inception of the conjecture little was known, not even the well-definedness of the left side (referred to as analytic) or the right side (referred to as algebraic) of this equation. John Tate expressed this in 1974 in a famous quote.

This remarkable conjecture relates the behavior of a function formula_8 at a point where it is not at present known to be defined to the order of a group which is not known to be finite!

By the modularity theorem proved in 2001 for elliptic curves over formula_9 the left side is now known to be well-defined and the finiteness of is known when additionally the analytic rank is at most 1, i.e., if formula_10 vanishes at most to order 1 at formula_11. Both parts remain open.

== Current status ==

The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture has been proved only in special cases:

# proved that if &quot;E&quot; is a curve over a number field &quot;F&quot; with complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field &quot;K&quot; of class number 1, &quot;F&quot; = &quot;K&quot; or Q, and &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, 1) is not 0 then &quot;E&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) is a finite group. This was extended to the case where &quot;F&quot; is any finite abelian extension of &quot;K&quot; by .
# showed that if a modular elliptic curve has a first-order zero at &quot;s&quot; = 1 then it has a rational point of infinite order; see Gross–Zagier theorem.
# showed that a modular elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; for which &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, 1) is not zero has rank 0, and a modular elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; for which &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, 1) has a first-order zero at &quot;s&quot; = 1 has rank 1.
# showed that for elliptic curves defined over an imaginary quadratic field &quot;K&quot; with complex multiplication by &quot;K&quot;, if the &quot;L&quot;-series of the elliptic curve was not zero at &quot;s&quot; = 1, then the &quot;p&quot;-part of the Tate–Shafarevich group had the order predicted by the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, for all primes &quot;p&quot; &gt; 7.
# , extending work of , proved that all elliptic curves defined over the rational numbers are modular, which extends results #2 and #3 to all elliptic curves over the rationals, and shows that the &quot;L&quot;-functions of all elliptic curves over Q are defined at &quot;s&quot; = 1.
# proved that the average rank of the Mordell–Weil group of an elliptic curve over Q is bounded above by 7/6. Combining this with the p-parity theorem of and and with the proof of the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory for GL(2) by , they conclude that a positive proportion of elliptic curves over Q have analytic rank zero, and hence, by , satisfy the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

There are currently no proofs involving curves with a rank greater than 1.

There is extensive numerical evidence for the truth of the conjecture.

== Consequences ==
Much like the Riemann hypothesis, this conjecture has multiple consequences, including the following two:
* Let be an odd square-free integer. Assuming the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, is the area of a right triangle with rational side lengths (a congruent number) if and only if the number of triplets of integers (, , ) satisfying is twice the number of triplets satisfying . This statement, due to Tunnell&#x27;s theorem , is related to the fact that &quot;n&quot; is a congruent number if and only if the elliptic curve has a rational point of infinite order (thus, under the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, its -function has a zero at ). The interest in this statement is that the condition is easily verified.
*In a different direction, certain analytic methods allow for an estimation of the order of zero in the center of the critical strip of families of &quot;L&quot;-functions. Admitting the BSD conjecture, these estimations correspond to information about the rank of families of elliptic curves in question. For example: suppose the generalized Riemann hypothesis and the BSD conjecture, the average rank of curves given by is smaller than .
*Because of the existence of the functional equation of the &quot;L&quot;-function of an elliptic curve, BSD allows us to calculate the parity of the rank of an elliptic curve. This is a conjecture in its own right called the parity conjecture, and it relates the parity of the rank of an elliptic curve to its global root number. This leads to many explicit arithmetic phenomena which are yet to be proved unconditionally. For instance:
**Every positive integer is a congruent number. 
**The elliptic curve given by where has infinitely many solutions over formula_12.
**Every positive rational number can be written in the form for and in formula_9. 
**For every rational number , the elliptic curve given by has rank at least .
**There are many more examples for elliptic curves over number fields. 

== Generalizations ==

There is a version of this conjecture for general abelian varieties over number fields. A version for abelian varieties over formula_9 is the following:

:formula_15

All of the terms have the same meaning as for elliptic curves, except that the square of the order of the torsion needs to be replaced by the product formula_16 involving the dual abelian variety formula_17. Elliptic curves as 1-dimensional abelian varieties are their own duals, i.e. formula_18, which simplifies the statement of the BSD conjecture. The regulator formula_19 needs to be understood for the pairing between a basis for the free parts of formula_20 and formula_21 relative to the Poincare bundle on the product formula_22.

The rank-one Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for modular elliptic curves and modular abelian varieties of GL(2)-type over totally real number fields was proved by Shou-Wu Zhang in 2001.

Another generalization is given by the Bloch-Kato conjecture.

<text>The Timex Sinclair 2068 (T/S 2068), released in November 1983, was Timex Sinclair&#x27;s third and last home computer for the United States market. It was also marketed in Canada, Argentina, Portugal and Poland, as Timex Computer 2068 (TC 2068).

==History==

Following Timex&#x27;s ZX81-based T/S 1000 and T/S 1500, a new series of ZX Spectrum-based machines was created. Initially named T/S 2000 (as reflected on the user manual), the machine evolved into the T/S 2048 prototype, and was eventually released as T/S 2068, with the name chosen mainly for marketing reasons.

Advertisements described the T/S 2068 as offering 72K of memory, color, and sound for a price under $200. Like the T/S 1500 was announced as a 40K memory machine (16K RAM + 24K ROM), so the 2068 was announced as a 72K machine (48K RAM + 24K ROM).

Although Timex Computer Corporation folded in February 1984, the independent Portuguese division continued to sell the machine in Portugal as the Timex Computer 2068, and Poland until 1989, as the Unipolbrit Komputer 2086. Although the Portuguese-made TC 2068 was also sold in Poland, only the Komputer 2086 was actually made there.

Timex of Portugal sold 2 versions of TC 2068: the silver TC 2068 version came with a ZX Spectrum emulator cartridge and a black TC 2068 version sold with TimeWord word processing cartridge plus the Timex RS232 Interface to use TimeWord with a RS232 printer. Strangely the black version came with a silver keyboard template with TimeWord commands to be used with the program. It can be removed because it is not glued to the black keyboard template.

Although the T/S 2068&#x27;s main improvements over the original Spectrum were in areas that had come in for widespread criticism (graphics, sound, keyboard and—to a lesser extent—the lack of joystick ports and cartridge support), it was not used as the basis for the Spectrum&#x27;s successors. The ZX Spectrum+ (1984) changed the keyboard only, and even the ZX Spectrum+ 128K (announced in May 1985, but not released in the UK until February 1986) retained the original machine&#x27;s graphical capabilities. However, unlike the UK models, the T/S 2068 was not burdened by the requirement of compatibility with previous models.

==Related machines==
===Timex Sinclair 2048===

A cut-down version of the T/S 2068, based on the T/S 2048 prototype named T/S 2048, was cancelled before entering intended production in 1984. This was due to the commercial failure of the T/S 1500.
According to an early Timex Sinclair 2000 computer flyer, it would have 16 KB of RAM, add a Kempston-compatible joystick interface and a two color high resolution mode for 80 column text.

The 2048 model number was the intended model number for what finally got named Timex Sinclair 2068. In an interview with Lou Galie, Senior Vice President of Technology at Timex, he tells what he claims to be the real story. Danny Ross, Timex Computer Corporation president, was giving a speech. Lou points: &quot;When Danny announced what was supposed to be the 2048, he mis-spoke and called it the 2068. When I called him on it, he laughed and said: - Rename it. 2068 is better than 2048.&quot;.

Although the T/S 2048 was cancelled, the Timex Computer 2048, based on the T/S 2048 prototype and released in 1984, was sold in Portugal and Poland.

===Timex Computer 2068===
For the TC 2068, Timex of Portugal made some changes the original T/S 2068 hardware, in order to improve compatibility with the original ZX Spectrum. It also created a Spectrum emulator cartridge that would auto-boot. This cartridge was larger, so the TC 2068 casing was changed to accommodate it.

Main hardware changes:
*Replaced the bus buffers with resistors like ZX Spectrum
*Changed the I/O connector to be ZX Spectrum compatible (not requiring the Zebra Twister board)
*Changed the cartridge slot top casing to accept bigger cartridges (for example &quot;Spectrum emulator&quot; and &quot;Timeword&quot; cartridges)
*Uses 9V instead of 15V

===Unipolbrit Komputer 2086===
A variant of the T/S 2068 was sold in Poland after 1986 under the name Unipolbrit Komputer 2086 (or UK 2086).

The machine was based on the TC 2068, with further changes introduced by that company:
*Modified ROM
*Replaced a joystick port with a parallel printer interface

==Technical specifications==
The T/S 2068 was a more sophisticated device, compared to its UK ancestor, the ZX Spectrum. Arguably one of the first Sinclair clones to significantly improve on the original design, it added a number of new features:
* an AY-3-8912 sound chip, as later used by Sinclair in the &quot;ZX Spectrum+ 128K&quot; (but mapped to different I/O ports and thus incompatible)
* twin joystick ports
* a slightly better &quot;chiclet keyboard&quot; with plastic keycaps
* a cartridge port to the right of the keyboard for ROM-based software
* Timex SCLD chip instead of the Spectrum&#x27;s ULA, offering additional Extended Color, Dual Screen and High Resolution screen modes:
** Text: 32×24 characters (8×8 pixels, rendered in graphics mode)
** Graphics: 256×192 pixels, 15 colours (two simultaneous colours - &quot;attributes&quot; - per 8×8 pixels, causing attribute clash)
** Extended Color: 256×192 pixels, 15 colors with colour resolution of 32×192 (two simultaneous colours - &quot;attributes&quot; - per 8×1 pixels)
** Dual Screen: (two 256×192 pixels screens can be placed in memory)
** High Resolution: 512×192 mode with 2 colours (Four palettes: Black &amp; White, Blue &amp; Yellow, Red &amp; Cyan, Magenta &amp; Green).
* improved T/S 2000 BASIC, that extends Sinclair BASIC with new keywords to address new hardware and bank-switched memory, allowing ROM cartridges to be mapped in.

However, these changes made the machine incompatible with most Spectrum machine-code software, which is to say virtually all commercial titles; less than 10% would run successfully. In an attempt to remedy this, many TS users built a cartridge with a Spectrum ROM for emulation.

===T/S 2000 BASIC===
T/S 2000 BASIC was an extended version of Sinclair BASIC, adding the following six keywords to the ordinary Sinclair BASIC ones:
*codice_1 deletes BASIC program line ranges. with the codice_2 cursor produces the command codice_1.
* codice_4 is a function that gives the amount of free RAM. codice_5 will show how much RAM is free.
* codice_6 is an error-handling function mostly used as codice_7 or codice_8.
* codice_9 can be used to reset the behaviour of codice_6. It was also intended to reset peripherals.
* codice_11 controls the AY-3-8192 sound chip.
* codice_12 is a function that gives the position of the internal joystick (Timex Sinclair 2090).

Timex Computer Corp published 7 cartridges and 37 cassettes along with the launch of T/S 2068. Some titles were released both on cartridge and tape. The software ranged from utilities and personal accounting programs to educational titles and games. Based on the original software catalog, 4 cartridges and 22 of the planned tapes were never released..

Timex of Portugal released cartridges (including the &quot;ZX Spectrum Emulator&quot; and &quot;TimeWord&quot;, that came with the TC 2068), tapes and software on disks (ex: Tasword for Timex FDD).

==Reception==
&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; in February 1984 called the Timex Sinclair 2068&#x27;s keyboard a &quot;mixed blessing&quot; and reported a flaw in the video signal, but liked its BASIC and concluded that &quot;for $200, the 2068 is a nice package&quot;.

Magazines dedicated to Timex Sinclair machines were published in the US, like SYNC (from 1981 to 1984) and &quot;Timex Sinclair User&quot; (1983), and dozens of fanzines and group newsletters also exist.

==Footnotes==

# The &quot;2086&quot; in the name was not a corruption of &quot;2068&quot;. The &quot;86&quot; derived from the year the computer was first made.

<doc id="435172" wikidata="Q474620" url="?curid=435172" title="Casuarinaceae">
<text>The Casuarinaceae are a family of dicotyledonous flowering plants placed in the order Fagales, consisting of four genera and 91 species of trees and shrubs native to eastern Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia, Malesia, Papuasia, and the Pacific Islands. At one time, all species were placed in the genus &quot;Casuarina&quot;. Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson separated out many of those species and renamed them into the new genera of &quot;Gymnostoma&quot; in 1980 and 1982, &quot;Allocasuarina&quot; in 1982, and &quot;Ceuthostoma&quot; in 1988, with some additional formal descriptions of new species in each other genus. At the time, it was somewhat controversial. The monophyly of these genera was later supported in a 2003 phylogenetic study of the family. In the Wettstein system, this family was the only one placed in the order Verticillatae. Likewise, in the Engler, Cronquist, and Kubitzki systems, the Casuarinaceae were the only family placed in the order Casuarinales.

Members of this family are characterized by drooping equisetoid (meaning &quot;looking like &quot;Equisetum&quot;&quot;; that is, horsetail) twigs, evergreen foliage, monoecious or dioecious and infructescences (&#x27;fruiting bodies&#x27;) strobiloid or cone-like, meaning combining many outward-pointing valves, each containing a seed, into roughly spherical, cone-like, woody structures. The roots have nitrogen-fixing nodules that contain the soil actinomycete &quot;Frankia&quot;.

In Australia, the most widely used common name for Casuarinaceae species is sheoak or she-oak (a comparison of the timber quality with English oak). Other common names in Australia include ironwood, bull-oak or buloke, beefwood, or cassowary tree.

The Shire of Buloke in Victoria, Australia, is named after the species &quot;Allocasuarina luehmannii&quot;.

<text>Misumena is a genus of crab spiders sometimes referred to as flower crab spiders. They are similar in appearance to several other genera in the family Thomisidae, such as &quot;Misumenoides&quot; and &quot;Mecaphesa&quot;.

&quot;Misumena vatia&quot;, the goldenrod crab spider, is a North American species commonly seen hunting in goldenrod (&quot;Solidago&quot;) sprays in autumn. It can change its color between white and yellow to match the flower it is sitting on. The color change takes a few days.

<doc id="435180" wikidata="Q650118" url="?curid=435180" title="Unreliable narrator">
<text>In literature, film, and other such arts, an unreliable narrator is a narrator who cannot be trusted, one whose credibility is compromised. They can be found in fiction and film, and range from children to mature characters. While unreliable narrators are almost by definition first-person narrators, arguments have been made for the existence of unreliable second- and third-person narrators, especially within the context of film and television, but sometimes also in literature.

The term “unreliable narrator” was coined by Wayne C. Booth in his 1961 book &quot;The Rhetoric of Fiction&quot;. James Phelan expands on Booth’s concept by offering the term “bonding unreliability” to describe situations in which the unreliable narration ultimately serves to approach the narrator to the work’s envisioned audience, creating a bonding communication between the implied author and this “authorial audience.”

Sometimes the narrator&#x27;s unreliability is made immediately evident. For instance, a story may open with the narrator making a plainly false or delusional claim or admitting to being severely mentally ill, or the story itself may have a frame in which the narrator appears as a character, with clues to the character&#x27;s unreliability. A more dramatic use of the device delays the revelation until near the story&#x27;s end. In some cases, the reader discovers that in the foregoing narrative, the narrator had concealed or greatly misrepresented vital pieces of information. Such a twist ending forces readers to reconsider their point of view and experience of the story. In some cases the narrator&#x27;s unreliability is never fully revealed but only hinted at, leaving readers to wonder how much the narrator should be trusted and how the story should be interpreted.

==Classification==
Attempts have been made at a classification of unreliable narrators. William Riggan analysed in a 1981 study four discernible types of unreliable narrators, focusing on the first-person narrator as this is the most common kind of unreliable narration. Riggan provides the following definitions and examples to illustrate his classifications:

;The Pícaro: The first-person narrator of a picaresque novel; an antihero serving as &quot;an embodiment of the obstinacy of sin&quot;, whose &quot;behavior is marked by rebelliousness&quot;, resentment, and aggression, and whose &quot;world view is characterized by resignation and pessimism&quot;. A gap exists between the pícaro&#x27;s &quot;whimsical and entertaining account and his self-indulgent explanations and morality on the one hand, and the perceptions of the more sensitive author and reader on the other&quot;. The pícaro is the &quot;unwitting butt&quot; of this narrative irony.
:Riggan gives the following examples of pícaro narrators: Apuleius in &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;; Lázaro in &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot;; Guzmán in &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot;; Don Pablos in &quot;El Buscón&quot;; Simplicius in Simplicius Simplicissimus; Moll in &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;; Augie March in &quot;The Adventures of Augie March&quot;; Felix Krull in &quot;Confessions of Felix Krull&quot;
;The Clown: A narrator in the tradition of the fool, the court jester and the sotie, whose unreliable narration includes &quot;irony, variations of meaning, ambiguities of definition, and possibilities for reversal and counter-reversal&quot;.
:Riggan gives the following examples of clown narrators: Folly in &quot;In Praise of Folly&quot; ; Tristram Shandy in &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot;; Humbert Humbert in &quot;Lolita&quot;; Oskar Matzerath in &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; 
;The Madman: A narrator who is untrustworthy due to an &quot;unbalanced mind&quot; whose narration serves as a case study in the pathology of insanity. The literary madman frequently exhibits traits such as being &quot;insignificant, petty, withdrawn, defensive, dreaming, spiteful, perversely logical, self-deluding, ultimately more of a type than a genuine individual, and a speaker who is soon if not immediately perceived as possessing all these traits and therefore of questionable trustworthiness in the presentation of his own account&quot;.
:Riggan gives the following examples of madman narrators: Poprishchin in &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;; the narrator of &quot;Notes from Underground&quot;; the first person narratives of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short stories; the narrator of &quot;The Blind Owl&quot;
;The Naïf: A narrator whose nature is revealed through their own narration and without their conscious awareness. The naïf narrator lacks the experience &quot;to deal in any far-reaching manner with the moral, ethical, emotional, and intellectual questions which arise from his first ventures into the world and from his account of those ventures.&quot;
:Riggan gives the following examples of naïf narrators: Huckleberry Finn in &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;; Holden Caulfield in &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;

Kathleen Wall argues that in &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, for the &quot;unreliability&quot; of the main character (Mr Stevens) as a narrator to work, we need to believe that he describes events reliably, while interpreting them in an unreliable way.

==Definitions and theoretical approaches==
Wayne C. Booth was among the first critics to formulate a reader-centered approach to unreliable narration and to distinguish between a reliable and unreliable narrator on the grounds of whether the narrator&#x27;s speech violates or conforms with general norms and values. He writes, &quot;I have called a narrator &quot;reliable&quot; when he speaks for or acts in accordance with the norms of the work (which is to say the implied author&#x27;s norms), &quot;unreliable&quot; when he does not.&quot; Peter J. Rabinowitz criticized Booth&#x27;s definition for relying too much on facts external to the narrative, such as norms and ethics, which must necessarily be tainted by personal opinion. He consequently modified the approach to unreliable narration.

Rabinowitz&#x27;s main focus is the status of fictional discourse in opposition to factuality. He debates the issues of truth in fiction, bringing forward four types of audience who serve as receptors of any given literary work:

# &quot;Actual audience&quot; (= the flesh-and-blood people who read the book)
# &quot;Authorial audience&quot; (= hypothetical audience to whom the author addresses his text)
# &quot;Narrative audience&quot; (= imitation audience which also possesses particular knowledge)
# &quot;Ideal narrative audience&quot; (= uncritical audience who accepts what the narrator is saying)

Rabinowitz suggests that &quot;In the proper reading of a novel, then, events which are portrayed must be treated as both &#x27;true&#x27; and &#x27;untrue&#x27; at the same time. Although there are many ways to understand this duality, I propose to analyze the four audiences which it generates.&quot; Similarly, Tamar Yacobi has proposed a model of five criteria (&#x27;integrating mechanisms&#x27;) which determine if a narrator is unreliable. Instead of relying on the device of the implied author and a text-centered analysis of unreliable narration, Ansgar Nünning gives evidence that narrative unreliability can be reconceptualized in the context of frame theory and of readers&#x27; cognitive strategies.

Unreliable narration in this view becomes purely a reader&#x27;s strategy of making sense of a text, i.e., of reconciling discrepancies in the narrator&#x27;s account (c.f. signals of unreliable narration). Nünning thus effectively eliminates the reliance on value judgments and moral codes which are always tainted by personal outlook and taste. Greta Olson recently debated both Nünning&#x27;s and Booth&#x27;s models, revealing discrepancies in their respective views.
and offers &quot;an update of Booth&#x27;s model by making his implicit differentiation between fallible and untrustworthy narrators explicit&quot;. Olson then argues &quot;that these two types of narrators elicit different responses in readers and are best described using scales for fallibility and untrustworthiness.&quot; She proffers that all fictional texts that employ the device of unreliability can best be considered along a spectrum of fallibility that begins with trustworthiness and ends with unreliability. This model allows for all shades of grey in between the poles of trustworthiness and unreliability. It is consequently up to each individual reader to determine the credibility of a narrator in a fictional text.

==Signals of unreliable narration==
Whichever definition of unreliability one follows, there are a number of signs that constitute or at least hint at a narrator&#x27;s unreliability. Nünning has suggested to divide these signals into three broad categories.

* Intratextual signs such as the narrator contradicting her or himself, having gaps in memory, or lying to other characters
* Extratextual signs such as contradicting the reader&#x27;s general world knowledge or impossibilities (within the parameters of logic)
* Reader&#x27;s literary competence. This includes the reader&#x27;s knowledge about literary types (e.g., stock characters that reappear over centuries), knowledge about literary genres and its conventions or stylistic devices

<doc id="435182" wikidata="Q2836862" url="?curid=435182" title="Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers">
<text>Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers is a &quot;Power Rangers&quot; mini-series set immediately after the end of the third season of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. As with the third season of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, this mini-series adapted footage and costumes from the eighteenth Super Sentai series, &quot;Ninja Sentai Kakuranger&quot;.

During fight scenes (and during the opening theme) an alternate version of the MMPR theme song was played, saying &quot;Go Go Alien Rangers&quot; instead of &quot;Go Go Power Rangers&quot;, although the 2-part premiere episode &quot;Alien Rangers of Aquitar&quot; still uses the &quot;Go Go Power Rangers&quot; theme (as the episode was still part of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;).

==Synopsis==

Picking up where the third season of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; left off, Master Vile has used the Orb of Doom to reverse the ages of everybody on Earth, including the Power Rangers, reducing them to children. However, unlike the last time, the rangers retain their memories of the proper time thanks to the Ninja Power Coins. Unfortunately, the rangers are unable to morph and fight; Zordon recruits the Alien Rangers of the planet Aquitar for help. These Rangers are humanoid, partially aquatic aliens and though Earth&#x27;s environment is ultimately inhospitable to them, they agree to help. Master Vile&#x27;s plans are foiled, and he leaves in annoyance, but Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa remain and intend to conquer Earth.

Hoping to restore the Rangers&#x27; proper ages, Billy Cranston builds a Regenerator powered by the Ninja Power Coins. However, only Billy is restored to normal before the device is stolen by Goldar and Rito Revolto. The Power Coins are then destroyed by Rita and Zedd. With the human Rangers&#x27; powers destroyed, only the Aquitian Rangers stand between Earth and the forces of evil, and they can&#x27;t stay on Earth forever. Ultimately, Zordon realizes that only one thing can restore everything to normal: the Zeo Crystal, which the human Rangers had split into five sub-crystals and scattered throughout time to keep it safe from Master Vile.

The five young Rangers are each sent back to a different country and point in time to find a sub-crystal. Upon success, they are returned to the present. All the while, the Aquitian Rangers, Billy, Zordon and Alpha 5 fend off the forces of Lord Zedd and Rita. The villains also plot to destroy the Command Center and steal the completed Zeo Crystal.

Ultimately, Zedd and Rita succeed in summoning the Aquitian Rangers&#x27; arch-foe, Hydro-Hog, to destroy them. After a great deal of difficulty, the Aquitian Rangers destroy him. Meanwhile, Aisha Campbell acquires the final sub-crystal in Africa. However, she chooses to remain in exchange for the sub-crystal and new friend Tanya Sloan goes in her place. Once the Zeo Crystal is recombined in a machine devised by Billy, Earth is restored to normal. The teenaged Rangers bid thanks and farewell to their Aquitian counterparts, who return to Aquitar. However, Goldar and Rito Revolto steal the Zeo Crystal out of the Command Center and their bomb goes off soon afterwards. The Rangers are teleported to safety just before the Command Center is destroyed.

===Aftermath===
The series sets up the transition from &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; to &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;. The two-part premiere of the latter resolved the cliffhanger ending and established the Rangers&#x27; new powers (as well as new foes, the Machine Empire).

The Aquitian Rangers are later seen or referenced in further seasons. Cestro returns unmorphed in &quot;Graduation Blues&quot;, seeking Billy&#x27;s help against the Hydro-Contaminators. Cestro later briefly appears with Delphine in &quot;Revelations of Gold&quot;. The Aquitian and Zeo Rangers team-up in the &quot;Rangers of Two Worlds&quot; two-parter, the first instance on the series of two full teams appearing together. The two-parter also centered around Billy rapidly aging because of his use of the regenerator. In &quot;Countdown to Destruction&quot; in &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot;, the Aquitian Rangers battle and are overwhelmed by Divatox&#x27;s forces. Aurico later appears morphed in the &quot;Power Rangers Wild Force&quot; episode, &quot;Forever Red&quot;, which saw every previous Red Ranger (save Rocky, as Jason returned to his previous role as Red Ranger, for which Rocky originally replaced him) united to stop the remnants of the Machine Empire. All five Rangers would later return in the series finale of &quot;Power Rangers Super Megaforce&quot; to battle alongside other veteran Ranger teams and the Megaforce Rangers.

==Characters==
===Aquitian Rangers===

* Aurico &lt;br&gt; The Red Aquitian Ranger, portrayed by David Bacon. Aurico leads the Rangers in battle, and devises strategies that ensure victory. His symbol is the circle and he uses ninjutsu to vanish from one place and appear in another to dodge his enemies. He pilots the Red Battle Borg and, during his stay on Earth, the Red Shogunzord, as well. Years later he joined nine other Red Rangers to fight the Machine Empire on the moon. He did not appear unmorphed in this episode, and was voiced by Christopher Glenn. 
* Corcus &lt;br&gt; The Black Aquitian Ranger, portrayed by Alan Palmer. He is the quietest member of the team, often lurking in the background, but fights with extreme ferocity against his enemies. The Black Aquitian Ranger&#x27;s symbol is the pentagon. He controls the Black Battle Borg and the Black Shogunzord.
* Cestro &lt;br&gt; The Blue Aquitian Ranger, portrayed by Karim Prince. Cestro is the brains of the team. A master of technology, he creates weapons and devices that get the Aquitian Rangers out of tough situations. He is entrusted with the power of the Blue Battleborg and Blue Shogunzord. The Blue Aquitian Ranger&#x27;s symbol is the square. His special attack is called the Aquitar Water Fall.
* Tideus &lt;br&gt; The Yellow Aquitian Ranger, portrayed by Jim Gray. He is a very strong and levelheaded individual. He is also the first male Yellow Ranger, a tradition which occurs frequently in the Sentai counterpart, but does not happen again in the American releases until Dustin becomes the Yellow Wind Ranger in &quot;Power Rangers Ninja Storm&quot; several years later. Tideus was entrusted with the power of the Yellow Battle Borg and the Yellow Shogunzord. The Yellow Aquitian Ranger&#x27;s symbol is the triangle. He can send yellow triangular energy beams at his enemies (created by slashing his sword through the air in a triangular motion). 
* Delphine &lt;br&gt; The White Aquitian Ranger, the leader of the Alien Rangers, portrayed by Rajia Baroudi. She is the first female leader and White Ranger. Her symbol is the arrow (left-pointing on her helmet&#x27;s forehead, downward-pointing on her visor). She pilots the White Battle Borg and the White Shogunzord. Delphine has more endurance and can survive far longer outside of water than the other Aquitians.

<doc id="435189" wikidata="Q1116061" url="?curid=435189" title="Duncan-class battleship">
<text>The &quot;Duncan&quot; class was a class of six pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the early 1900s. The six ships—, , , , , and —were ordered in response to Russian naval building, specifically the fast second-class battleships of the , which they were specifically to counter. The foremost design consideration was a high top speed to match the rumoured (and incorrect) top speed of of the Russian ships while maintaining the same battery of guns and keeping displacement from growing. This forced significant compromises in armour protection, though the ships adopted a revised system of protection for the bow, which was copied in other designs like the .

All members of the class served in the Mediterranean Fleet after completion, thereafter joining the Home, Channel, and Atlantic Fleets over the next ten years. In 1906, &quot;Montagu&quot; was wrecked off Lundy Island and could not be salvaged. The period passed largely uneventfully for the other members of the class. Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the ships were sent to reinforce the Grand Fleet, where they were used on the Northern Patrol to help blockade Germany. In November, &quot;Russell&quot; and &quot;Exmouth&quot; bombarded Zeebrugge, but otherwise the &quot;Duncan&quot;s saw no action in the first months of the war.

&quot;Cornwallis&quot; participated in the Dardanelles campaign beginning in early 1915, and most of the other members of the class joined her there over the course of the year. &quot;Duncan&quot; instead served in the Atlantic and later in the Adriatic Sea and &quot;Albemarle&quot; remained with the Grand Fleet and later went to Murmansk, Russia, to guard the port. &quot;Russell&quot; and &quot;Cornwallis&quot; were sunk by German U-boats in April 1916 and January 1917, respectively. The three surviving members of the class saw little activity in the final two years of the war, though &quot;Duncan&quot; and &quot;Exmouth&quot; were involved in the Allied intervention in Greece. All three ships were ultimately sold for scrap in the immediate post-war reduction in naval strength and were broken up in 1920.

==Design==
The six ships of the &quot;Duncan&quot; class were ordered in response to Russian s that began construction in the mid-1890s. At the time, the British mistakenly believed the Russian vessels were capable of a top speed of (though they were not that fast in service), so the Director of Naval Construction, William Henry White, set about designing a British response. His initial proposals were completed by February 1898, but the Board of Admiralty decided that more work would be required on the new ships, and so modified versions of the preceding would be ordered in the meantime. These ships incorporated some of the aspects of White&#x27;s design, namely the revised armour protection layout in the bow, which abandoned the heavy transverse bulkhead that connected both ends of the armoured belt in favour of continuing the side armour all the way to the stem, albeit at reduced thickness; these became the five s. White then returned to working on the design for the response to &quot;Peresvet&quot;, completing a revised version on 14 June 1898.

To achieve the desired speed of 19 knots while keeping displacement about less than the &quot;Formidable&quot;s and retaining the same battery of four guns carried by earlier British battleships, White was forced to make significant reductions, particularly in terms of armour protection. As such, they represented an evolution of the smaller , rather than a direct development of the &quot;Formidable&quot; or &quot;London&quot; types. The &quot;Duncan&quot; class was about a thousand tons heavier than the &quot;Canopus&quot; class, and with that increase in displacement, they acquired more powerful guns, heavier armour, and an improvement in top speed by one to two knots. Despite these improvements, the &quot;Duncan&quot;s proved to be disappointments in service, owing to their reduced defensive characteristics, which rendered them inferior to the true first class battleships to which they were inevitably compared. Nevertheless, they were still markedly superior to the &quot;Peresvets&quot; they had been built to counter, and they were some of the fastest battleships in service at the time they were built.

Minor revisions to the dimensions were made between June and September, when the finalised design was approved, with tenders for shipyard contracts being sent out the following month. Public pressure over the 1898 programme—the first three &quot;London&quot;s that were supposedly slower than the &quot;Peresvet&quot;s—led to the passage of a Special Supplementary Programme that allocated funding for the first four &quot;Duncan&quot;s, all of which were laid down in 1899. Two more were added under the 1899 programme.

===General characteristics and machinery===
The &quot;Duncan&quot;-class ships were long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The &quot;Duncan&quot;-class battleships displaced normally and up to fully loaded. They had two pole masts fitted with fighting tops; each top carried a searchlight, and four additional searchlights were mounted on the forward and aft bridges. The ships&#x27; hulls were divided with longitudinal bulkheads that should have allowed for counter-flooding to offset underwater damage, but the equipment necessary to quickly flood a compartment was insufficient, as was typical in many British pre-dreadnought designs. The decision to adopt longitudinal bulkheads was made in large part to keep reserve stability low, since that made the ships more stable gun platforms.

Their crew numbered 720 officers and ratings, though this varied over the course of their careers; in 1904, &quot;Russell&quot; had a crew of 736, and while serving as a flagship that same year, &quot;Exmouth&quot; had a crew of 762. During the First World War in 1915, &quot;Russell&quot;″s crew had grown to 781. The ships were fitted with Type 1 wireless telegraphy sets, with the exception of &quot;Exmouth&quot;, which received Type 2 sets. The remainder of the class had their Type 1s replaced with Type 2 sets later in their career, except for &quot;Montagu&quot;, which had already been wrecked by that time. &quot;Cornwallis&quot; and &quot;Russell&quot; eventually received Type 3 wireless transmitters. The ships carried a number of small boats that varied over the course of their careers, including a variety of steam and sail pinnaces, steam launches, cutters, whalers, gigs, dinghies, and rafts.

The &quot;Duncan&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 4-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two inward-turning, four-bladed screws. Steam was provided by twenty-four Belleville boilers. The boilers were divided into four boiler rooms, two of which contained eight boilers each and the other two with four boilers per room; they were trunked into two closely spaced funnels located amidships. The &quot;Duncan&quot;-class ships had a top speed of from , though on speed trials their maximum speed ranged from , with power slightly exceeding the design figure. At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for .

===Armament===

The &quot;Duncan&quot;s had four 12-inch 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft. These were the same guns and mountings carried aboard the &quot;Formidable&quot; and &quot;London&quot; classes, although their barbettes were reduced in diameter as a weight-saving measure. To account for the slightly narrower barbettes, the gun houses also had to be reduced in size, though the guns were carried in the same BVI-type mountings. The mounts had a range of elevation from -5 degrees to of 13.5 degrees, and required the guns to return to 4.5 degrees to be loaded. The guns had a muzzle velocity of , and they were capable of penetrating 12 inches of Krupp armour at a range of . At their maximum elevation, the guns had a range of .

The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, the same battery carried by earlier British battleships. The casemates were sponsoned further out from the sides of the hull, however, to improve their firing arcs while reducing blast effects on the hull when the guns fired ahead or astern. The designers considered moving two of the guns per side to the upper deck to improve their fighting capabilities in heavy seas, but decided that such an arrangement would hamper ammunition movement from the magazines. The guns had a muzzle velocity of . These guns could penetrate six inches of Krupp armour at . Maximum elevation was 14 degrees, which allowed the guns to engage targets out to . For defence against torpedo boats, they carried ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns. As was customary for battleships of the period, they were also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull.

In 1915, the five surviving ships received two anti-aircraft guns. &quot;Albemarle&quot;, &quot;Duncan&quot;, and probably &quot;Exmouth&quot; had theirs installed on their aft superstructure, while &quot;Russell&quot; had hers mounted on her quarterdeck and &quot;Cornwallis&quot; had her guns placed atop their forwardmost casemates. Between 1916 and 1917, &quot;Albemarle&quot; had her casemate guns removed, with four of the 6-inch guns being relocated to the 12-pounder battery and two of those guns being removed to make room. The 6-inch guns were placed in shielded pivot mounts. In 1917–1918, &quot;Albemarle&quot; had the rest of her 12-pounders removed altogether.

===Armour===
The &quot;Duncan&quot; class adopted the basic armour layout of the &quot;Formidable&quot; class, but with significant revision to the forward armour scheme and with significantly thinner levels of protection. Earlier battleship designs had employed a partial armoured belt that terminated abreast of both of the main battery turrets; the ends of the belt were connected by way of transverse bulkheads to create a central citadel that protected the ships&#x27; magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. This arrangement left the bow and stern unprotected, and thus highly vulnerable to enemy fire. White was concerned that the unprotected bow could be flooded by even light gunfire, which would reduce speed and maneuverability. Since the &quot;Duncan&quot;s were intended to serve as fast battleships, White decided to reduce the risk of this kind of damage by discarding the forward transverse bulkhead in favor of a complete belt. The main portion of the belt was thick and extended to just forward of the fore turret, thereafter being gradually reduced to , then , then to , and finally to close to the stem. The aft end of the ship retained the traditional transverse bulkhead, which was also 7 in thick. Abaft of the bulkhead, the hull was protected by a strake of thick side armour.

Horizontal protection consisted of a pair of armoured decks that covered the ships&#x27; vitals. The main deck ran from the stem to the aft bulkhead and was connected to the top of the belt; it was 1 to 2 in thick, with the thicker armour over the central portion of the ship and the thinner steel over the bow. The second deck, at middle deck level, was 1 in thick and covered just the central citadel, sloping down on the sides to the belt. The voids created between the decks and behind the belt were used to store coal, which had the added benefit of increasing the strength of the side protection layout. The bow and stern had a curved armour deck below the waterline that extended from the barbettes to either end of the hull, which was 1 to 2 in thick. The ships&#x27; main battery turrets faces and sides were thick, with rears and 2–3 in roofs. The turrets sat atop barbettes that were on the outer face above the belt and 7 in thick behind the belt; their inner faces were reduced to 10 and 4 inches thick, respectively. The casemate battery was protected with of armour plate, and their ammunition hoists received 2 in of armour protection. The ships&#x27; forward conning towers had 10–12 in sides and their aft conning towers had 3 in sides.

==Service history==

From their commissioning in 1903–1904, all six ships served with the Mediterranean Fleet, though their tenure in the unit was relatively short lived, with all of the vessels being reassigned to the Channel Fleet in 1905. &quot;Exmouth&quot; and &quot;Russell&quot; had already left the Mediterranean Fleet by that point, doing a brief stint in the Home Fleet in 1904 before joining their sisters in the Channel Fleet. On 30 May 1906, &quot;Montagu&quot; ran aground on Lundy Island. After lengthy attempts to repair and refloat the ship failed, she was abandoned and broken up in situ. The five surviving ships moved to the Atlantic Fleet in 1907, though &quot;Duncan&quot; and &quot;Exmouth&quot; left for another tour with the Mediterranean Fleet in 1908. &quot;Cornwallis&quot; and &quot;Russell&quot; joined them there the following year. In July 1908, &quot;Russell&quot;, &quot;Albemarle&quot;, &quot;Duncan&quot;, and &quot;Exmouth&quot; visited Canada during the Quebec Tercentenary. &quot;Albemarle&quot; remained in the Atlantic until 1910, when she was reassigned to the Home Fleet. The other four ships joined her there in 1912, and together they formed first the 4th Battle Squadron and later the 6th Battle Squadron. They remained in the 6th Squadron until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.

With the onset of hostilities, Admiral John Jellicoe, the commander of the Grand Fleet, requested that the 6th Squadron ships be sent to strengthen the main British fleet in accordance with pre-war plans. The five &quot;Duncan&quot;s were used to reinforce the cruisers on the Northern Patrol, maintaining the distant blockade of Germany. While serving with the Grand Fleet, the ships were assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron On 2 November, they were transferred to the Channel Fleet owing to increased German naval activity in the southern North Sea; there, they reconstituted the 6th Squadron on 14 November. &quot;Russell&quot; and &quot;Exmouth&quot; bombarded German-occupied Zeebrugge, which was being used as an advance naval base for U-boats, in late November, though they inflicted little damage and the Germans quickly resumed operations there. The ships were used to guard the southern British coast against German attacks through the end of the year, and in the first half of 1915, the 6th Squadron was gradually dispersed.

&quot;Cornwallis&quot; was the first to leave, in January 1915, when she was sent to join the Dardanelles campaign against the Ottoman Empire. She participated in numerous attacks on the coastal fortresses guarding the Dardanelles, all of which failed to break through, leading to the Gallipoli Campaign, which &quot;Cornwallis&quot; also supported. &quot;Albemarle&quot; was recalled to the Grand Fleet for further duty on the Northern Patrol in April. In May, &quot;Exmouth&quot; was also sent to reinforce the Dardanelles squadron. Fitted with heavy anti-torpedo nets, she was the only battleship stationed forward at Kephalo just outside the straits, owing to the increased threat of German U-boats in the area. &quot;Duncan&quot; was reassigned to the Finisterre-Azores-Madeira Station in July 1915, thereafter joining the Italian fleet in the Adriatic, where she saw little activity. &quot;Russell&quot; was transferred to the Dardanelles campaign in November 1915; &quot;Albemarle&quot; was to have gone at the same time, but she was badly damaged in a storm and was unable to make the voyage. &quot;Russell&quot; saw little activity there, apart from supporting the evacuation of Cape Helles in January 1916.

&quot;Albemarle&quot; remained with the Grand Fleet through January 1916, when she was assigned as a guard ship for the Russian port of Murmansk. While cruising off Malta on 27 April 1916, &quot;Russell&quot; struck a pair of naval mines that had been laid by the U-boat . She quickly caught fire, exploded, and then capsized and sank with the loss of 125 of her crew. &quot;Cornwallis&quot; met a similar fate on 9 January 1917, when she was torpedoed and sunk by , though she remained afloat long enough for most of her crew to be evacuated by escorting destroyers; only fifteen men were killed in the sinking. &quot;Exmouth&quot; and &quot;Duncan&quot; were stationed in Salonika, Greece, during the Allied intervention in the &quot;Noemvriana&quot; coup in 1916. Both ships sent men ashore as part of the intervention. &quot;Albemarle&quot; returned to Britain in September 1916 and was laid up for the rest of her existence. She, &quot;Exmouth&quot;, and &quot;Duncan&quot; survived the war and all three were eventually broken up for scrap in 1920.

<doc id="435191" wikidata="Q1998151" url="?curid=435191" title="Power Rangers Zeo">
<text>Power Rangers Zeo is a television series and the fourth season of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise, based on the 19th Super Sentai series &quot;Chouriki Sentai Ohranger&quot;. It is the continuation of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; and aired in 1996.

&quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot; is the first season of &quot;Power Rangers&quot; to follow the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; practice of annual Ranger suit changes.

==Plot==
After witnessing the destruction of the Command Center, the powerless Rangers discover the Zeo Crystal intact in the rubble—apparently dropped by Goldar and Rito Revolto. The Crystal guides them to a portal which takes them deep underground to the Power Chamber where they find Zordon and Alpha 5 waiting for them. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers become the Zeo Rangers, a new team of Rangers powered by the Zeo Crystal. The four remaining Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Tommy Oliver, Adam Park, Rocky DeSantos and Katherine Hillard become Zeo Ranger V — Red, Zeo Ranger IV — Green, Zeo Ranger III — Blue and Zeo Ranger I — Pink respectively and Tanya Sloan joins the team as Zeo Ranger II — Yellow, while Billy Cranston chooses to become their technical advisor rather than continuing as a Ranger.

The Machine Empire, led by King Mondo and Queen Machina, enters Earth&#x27;s solar system, seeking to conquer Earth, with the Zeo Rangers serving as the only opposition. Many, even Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, are forced to flee to the M51 Galaxy under the threat of destruction. Unbeknownst to anyone, Rito and Goldar – now amnesiac – are left behind on Earth. They are taken in by Bulk and Skull, who have them serve as butlers. Meanwhile, Bulk and Skull continue to be members of the Junior Police Force until Lt. Jerome Stone is dismissed when Bulk tries to win the heart of the chief&#x27;s daughter. Quitting as a show of respect for Stone, they join him at his new detective agency.

Over time, the Machine Empire wears down the five Zeo Rangers, but they are rescued by the mysterious Gold Ranger. Though his identity is unknown, it quickly becomes clear he is there to help the Rangers. After he is injured in battle, it is revealed that the mysterious Gold Ranger is an alien, Trey of Triforia. Split into three separate selves, Trey is forced to temporarily pass his powers to a worthy warrior while healing. They attempt to transfer Trey&#x27;s powers to Billy, but as Billy acquired excess negative energy during the Command Center&#x27;s destruction, he is unable to do so. Ultimately the successor is Jason Lee Scott, the original Red Power Ranger and team leader. This event also sees the introduction of the more powerful Super Zeo Zords, which are used against a tougher generation of machines. The Super Zeo Megazord is powerful enough to later destroy King Mondo, creating a power vacuum in the Machine Empire.

Secretly returning from the M51 Galaxy, Lord Zedd and Rita seek to take power again. Operating out of an RV with Finster, they restore Goldar and Rito&#x27;s memories, retrieving the pair in the process. After King Mondo&#x27;s death, they launch their first plan, to use Louie Kaboom to take over the Machine Empire. Though he succeeds, he breaks free of Zedd and Rita&#x27;s control. He embarks on his own plans to conquer Earth and destroy the Zeo Rangers. Louie is eventually killed by King Mondo&#x27;s first-born son Prince Gasket and his wife Princess Archerina, who rule until King Mondo&#x27;s reconstruction is complete, which causes them to flee.

When Billy begins rapidly aging as a side-effect of restoring his proper age before undoing Master Vile&#x27;s spell in the last series, the Zeo and Aquitian Rangers race to help him and fend off monsters from King Mondo as well as Zedd and Rita. Billy leaves Earth for treatment on Aquitar and chooses to stay to be with Cestria. Soon after, it is discovered the Gold Ranger powers are leaving Jason and draining his life force in the process as the alien powers were not meant for a human. Trey is still in recovery, but a risky gamble with the Zeo Crystal heals him, restoring his powers. Rita and Lord Zedd finally get revenge on the Machine Empire by crippling their leaders with a bomb.

<text>The Rolls-Royce Trent is a family of high-bypass turbofans produced by Rolls-Royce. It continues the three spool architecture of the RB211 with a maximum thrust ranging from . Launched as the RB-211-524L in June 1988, the prototype first ran in August 1990. Its first variant is the Trent 700 introduced on the Airbus A330 in March 1995, then the Trent 800 for the Boeing 777 (1996), the Trent 500 for the A340 (2002), the Trent 900 for the A380 (2007), the Trent 1000 for the Boeing 787 (2011), the Trent XWB for the A350 (2015), and the Trent 7000 for the A330neo (2018). It also has marine and industrial variants such as the RR MT30.

==Development==

Despite the success of the RB211, Rolls-Royce&#x27;s share of the large civil turbofan market was only 8% when it was privatised in April 1987, the market being dominated by General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. In June 1987, Rolls-Royce was studying whether to launch a thrust variant of the RB211, to be called the RB211-700, for the Airbus A330 twin-jet, the long-range Boeing 767 and the MD-11, derived from the 747-400&#x27;s -524D4D, with growth potential to . By June 1988, Rolls-Royce was investing over $540 million to develop the uprated RB-211-524L with a new fan (up from ) for the -524G/H and a fourth LP turbine stage up from three, targeting .

At the September 1988 Farnborough Airshow, the -524L development was confirmed, estimated at £300 million, to power the MD-11 and A330 as a full-scale model was unveiled by Frank Whittle. In June 1989, the RB211-524L Trent was confirmed for the A330, rated at . Rated at for the MD-11, the Trent made its first run on 27 August 1990 in Derby. By September 1992, the Trent 600 for the MD-11 was abandoned and prototypes were rebuilt as Trent 700 engines for the A330 with a fan.

The UK government granted Rolls-Royce £450 million of repayable launch investment, repaid with interest, to develop the RB.211 engine and the Trent family up to the Trent 900. Rolls-Royce obtained £200 million for the Trent 8104, 500 and 600 variants in 1997, and £250 million for the Trent 600 and 900 variants in 2001.

New proposed planes required higher thrust and customers wanted the Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 twinjets to fly Extended-range Twin-engine Operations at introduction. Rolls-Royce decided to offer an engine for every large civil airliner, based on a common core to lower development costs, and the three-shaft design provided flexibility, allowing each spool to be individually scaled. In keeping with Rolls-Royce&#x27;s tradition of naming its jet engines after rivers, the engine family is named after the River Trent in the Midlands of England, a name previously used for the RB.50, Rolls-Royce&#x27;s first working turboprop engine; and the 1960s RB.203, a bypass turbofan and the first three-spool engine, designed to replace the Spey but never introduced.

In 2019, Rolls-Royce delivered 510 Trent engines.

==Design==
Like its RB211 predecessor, the Trent uses a concentric three-spool design rather than a two-spool configuration. The Trent family keeps a similar layout, but each spool can be individually scaled and can rotate more closely to its optimal speed. The core noise levels and exhaust emissions are lower than those of the RB211.

Hollow titanium fan blades with an internal Warren-girder structure achieve strength, stiffness and damage tolerance at low weight. To operate in temperatures above their melting point, cooling air is bled from the compressor through laser-drilled holes in the hollow turbine blades, made from a single crystal of a nickel alloy and covered by thermal barrier coatings. Each turbine blade removes up to from the gas stream.

In April 1998, the RB211-524HT was introduced for the 747-400 with the Trent 700 core, replacing the previous RB211-524G/H with 2% better TSFC, up to a 40% lower NOx emissions and a 50 °C cooler turbine. The Trent 800 LP spool rotates at 3300 rpm, its diameter fan tip travels at m/s. The Trent 900&#x27;s fan keeps a low mean jet velocity at take-off to lower the Airbus A380&#x27;s noise.

==Variants==

=== First Trent 600 ===
At the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 programme launch at the end of 1986, the airframe was only offered with GE CF6-80C2 or PW4000 engines, however Rolls-Royce was preparing to propose the 747-400&#x27;s RB211-524D4D rated at . By June 1988, Rolls-Royce was investing over $540 million to develop the uprated RB-211-524L with a new fan (up from ) for the -524G/H and a fourth LP turbine stage up from three, targeting .
Rated at , the Trent made its first run on 27 August 1990 in Derby. By July 1991, the MD-11 Trent was abandoned after the demise of Air Europe, its only customer. By February 1992, there were four Trent 600 engines with a fan. By September 1992, three had been rebuilt as Trent 700 engines for the A330 with a fan.

===Trent 700===

Rolls-Royce was studying a RB211 development for the Airbus A330 at its launch in June 1987. The Trent 700 was first selected by Cathay Pacific in April 1989, first ran in summer 1992, was certified in January 1994 and put into service in March 1995. Keeping the characteristic three-shaft architecture of the RB211, it is the first variant of the Trent family. With its fan for a 5:1 bypass ratio, it produces of thrust and reaches an overall pressure ratio of 36:1. It competes with the GE CF6-80E1 and the PW4000 to power the A330.

===Trent 800===
The Trent 800 is one of the engine options for the early Boeing 777 variants. Launched in September 1991, it first ran in September 1993, was granted EASA certification on 27 January 1995, and entered service in 1996. It reached a 40% market share, ahead of the competing PW4000 and GE90, and the last Trent 800-powered 777 was delivered in 2010. The Trent 800 has the Trent family three shaft architecture, with a fan. With a 6.4:1 bypass ratio and an overall pressure ratio reaching 40.7:1, it generates up to of thrust.

=== Trent 8100 ===

In the early Trent 800 studies in 1990, Rolls-Royce forecast a growth potential from with a new HP core. By March 1997, Boeing studied 777-200X/300X growth derivatives for a September 2000 introduction: GE was proposing a GE90-102B, while P&amp;W offered its PW4098 and Rolls-Royce was proposing a Trent 8100. Rolls-Royce was also investigating another variant, the Trent 8102, which would produce over of thrust. By December 1997, the -300X grew to . The Trent 8104 design was to be completed by June 1998, while the -200X entry into service slipped to mid-2002. Higher thrust was obtained with new swept fan blades while keeping a fan.

The Trent 8104 first ran on 16 December 1998, and exceeded of thrust five days later, before two other engines would join by mid-1999. The swept fan blades produce 2–3% more flow at a given speed with the same fan, for an additional of thrust, while fan efficiency is 1% better. The HP compressor rotors and stators and the IP compressor stators were designed with 3D aerodynamics. As the 777-200X/300X grew to a MTOW of , thrust requirements drifted to . The fan diameter was to reach to increase the thrust.

By June 1999, the 8104 served as a basis for the proposed Trent 8115, with a scaled core by 2.5% geometrically and 5% aerodynamically and a fan enlarged from , while keeping the Trent 800 architecture: an eight-stage IP compressor and a six-stage HP compressor both driven by a single-stage turbine, and a five-stage LP turbine. In July 1999, Boeing selected the General Electric GE90 over the Trent 8115 and P&amp;W offer to exclusively power the longer-range 777s, as GE offered to substantially finance the airframe&#x27;s development, for around $100 million. Rolls-Royce later dropped the Trent 8115 but continued to work on the Trent 8104 as a technology demonstrator.

===Trent 500===

The Trent 500 exclusively powers the larger A340-500/600 variants. It was selected in June 1997, first ran in May 1999, first flew in June 2000, and achieved certification on 15 December 2000. It entered service in July 2002 and 524 engines were delivered on-wing until the A340 production ended in 2011. Keeping the three spool architecture of the Trent family, it has the Trent 700&#x27;s fan and a Trent 800 core scaled down. It produces up to of thrust at take-off and has a bypass ratio up to 8.5:1 in cruise.

===Trent 900===

The Trent 900 powers the Airbus A380, competing with the Engine Alliance GP7000. Initially proposed for the Boeing 747-500/600X in July 1996, this first application was later abandoned but it was offered for the A3XX, launched as the A380 in December 2000. It first ran on 18 March 2003, made its maiden flight on 17 May 2004 on an A340 testbed, and was certified by the EASA on 29 October 2004. Producing up to , the Trent 900 has the same three shaft architecture of the Trent family with a fan. It has an 8.5–8.7:1 bypass ratio and a 37–39:1 overall pressure ratio.

===Second Trent 600===

In March 2000, Boeing was to launch the longer range 767-400ERX powered by engines, with deliveries planned for 2004. In July, Rolls-Royce was to supply its Trent 600 for the 767-400ERX and Boeing 747X, while the European Union was limiting the Engine Alliance offer on quadjets. The Trent 600 was scaled from the Trent 500 with a swept fan diameter raised to for a higher bypass ratio and lower fuel burn. Boeing offered the longer-range 767-400ERX with a higher MTOW and a higher thrust for better takeoff performance. The 767-400ERX was dropped in 2001 to favour the Sonic Cruiser. When Boeing launched the 747-8 in November 2005, it was exclusively powered by the General Electric GEnx.

===Trent 1000===


The Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 is one of the two engine options for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, competing with the General Electric GEnx. It first ran on 14 February 2006 and first flew on 18 June 2007 before a joint EASA/FAA certification on 7 August 2007 and service introduction on 26 October 2011. The engine has a bypass ratio over 10:1, a fan and keeps the characteristic three-spool layout of the Trent series.

The updated Trent 1000 TEN with technology from the Trent XWB and the Advance3 aims for up to 3% better fuel burn. It first ran in mid-2014, was EASA certified in July 2016, first flew on a 787 on 7 December 2016 and was introduced on 23 November 2017. Corrosion-related fatigue cracking of IP turbine blades was discovered in early 2016, grounding up to 44 aircraft and costing Rolls-Royce at least £1354 million. By early 2018 it had a % market share of the confirmed order book. The Trent 7000 is a version with bleed air used for the Airbus A330neo.

=== Trent 1500 ===

When the MTOW A340-600HGW first flew in November 2005, Airbus was studying an enhanced version of the larger A340 variants to enter service in 2011. It would better compete with the 777-300ER and its 8–9% lower fuel burn than the A340-600: improved General Electric GEnx or Trent 1500 engines would erode this by 6–7%. The Trent 1500 would keep the Trent 500&#x27;s fan diameter and nacelle, with the smaller, advanced Trent 1000 core and a revised LP turbine for a bypass ratio increased from 7.5–7.6:1 to 9.5:1. The last A340 was delivered in 2011 as it was replaced by the updated A350XWB design.

===Trent XWB===

The Trent XWB was selected in July 2006 to exclusively power the Airbus A350 XWB. The first engine was run on 14 June 2010, it first flew on an Airbus A380 testbed on 18 February 2012, was certified in early 2013, and first flew on an A350 on 14 June 2013. It keeps the characteristic three-shaft layout of the Trent, with a fan, an IP and HP spool. The XWB-84 generates up to of thrust and the XWB-97 up to . The engine has a 9.6:1 bypass ratio and a 50:1 pressure ratio. It had its first in-flight shutdown on 11 September 2018, as the fleet accumulated 2.2 million flight hours. It is the most powerful among all Trent engines.

===Trent 7000===
The Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 exclusively powers the Airbus A330neo. Announced on 14 July 2014, it first ran on 27 November 2015, made its first flight on 19 October 2017 aboard on an A330neo, received its EASA type certification on 20 July 2018 as a Trent 1000 variant, was first delivered on 26 November, and was cleared for ETOPS 330 by 20 December. Compared to the A330&#x27;s Trent 700, the engine doubles the bypass ratio to 10:1 and halves emitted noise. Pressure ratio is increased to 50:1 and it has a fan and a bleed air system. Fuel consumption is improved by 11%.

===Non-aircraft variants===

==== MT30 (Marine Turbine) ====
The MT30 (Marine Turbine) is a derivative of the Trent 800 (with a Trent 500 gearbox fitted), producing 36 MW for maritime applications. The current version is a turboshaft engine, producing 36 MW, using the Trent 800 core to drive a power turbine which takes power to an electrical generator or to mechanical drives such as waterjets or propellers. Amongst others, it powers the Royal Navy&#x27;s s.

====Industrial Trent 60 Gas Turbine====
This derivative is designed for power generation and mechanical drive, much like the Marine Trent. It delivers up to 66 MW of electricity at 42% efficiency. It comes in two key versions DLE (Dry Low Emission) and WLE (Wet Low Emission). The WLE is water injected, allowing it to produce 58 MW at ISO conditions instead of 52 MW. It shares components with the Trent 700 and 800. The heat from the exhaust, some 416–433 °C, can be used to heat water and drive steam turbines, improving efficiency of the package. Besides Rolls-Royce, the Trent 60 is also packaged by UK-based Centrax LTD, a privately owned engineering firm based in Newton Abbot, UK.

== Operational history ==

First run in August 1990 as the model Trent 700, the Trent has achieved significant commercial success, having been selected as the launch engine for all three of the 787 variants (Trent 1000), the A380 (Trent 900) and the A350 (Trent XWB). Its overall share of the markets in which it competes is around 40%. Sales of the Trent family of engines have made Rolls-Royce the second biggest supplier of large civil turbofans after General Electric, relegating rival Pratt &amp; Whitney to third position. By June 2019, the Trent family had completed over 125 million hours.

British Airways and Thai Airways are currently the largest operator of Trents, with four variants in service or on order, followed by Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific with three variants in service.

=== Incidents ===

On 17 January 2008, a British Airways Boeing 777-236ER, operating as Flight 38 from Beijing to London, crash-landed at Heathrow Airport after both Trent 800 engines lost power during the aircraft&#x27;s final approach. The subsequent investigation found that ice released from the fuel system had accumulated on the fuel-oil heat exchanger, leading to a restriction of fuel flow to the engines. This resulted in Airworthiness Directives mandating the replacement of the heat exchanger. This order was extended to the 500 and 700 series engines after a similar loss of power was observed on one engine of an Airbus A330 in one incident, and both engines in another. The modification involves replacing a face plate with many small protruding tubes with one that is flat.

On 4 November 2010, a Qantas Airbus A380-842 (Registration VH-OQA), operating as Flight 32 en route from Singapore to Sydney, suffered an uncontained engine failure (explosion) in one of its four Trent 972-84. The cause was traced to an incorrectly manufactured oil feed stub pipe.

==Research==

===Affordable Near-Term Low Emissions===

Between 1 March 2000 and 28 February 2005, the EU funded the project, aiming to design and test two strategies to reduce by 12–20% and nitrous oxides by up to 80% from 2007/2008, with an overall budget of €101.6 Million including €50.9 from the EU and coordinated by Rolls-Royce plc. It was equally shared between the demonstrator and the CLEAN programme for longer term technology applications. The ANTLE programme targeted reductions of 12% in  emissions, 60% in  emissions, 20% in acquisition cost, 30% in life cycle cost and 50% in development cycle, while improving reliability by 60%. The test phase ended by summer 2005.

The ANTLE engine was based on a Rolls-Royce Trent 500. Rolls-Royce Deutschland was responsible for the high pressure compressor, Rolls-Royce UK for the combustion chamber and the high pressure turbine, Italian Avio for the intermediate pressure turbine, and ITP for the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) and the external casing for an investment of €20.5 million, a 20% stake in the programme. Volvo Aero was responsible for the rear turbine structures. It has a new 5 stage HP compressor, a lean burn combustor and unshrouded HP turbine and a variable-geometry IP turbine. Hispano Suiza&#x27;s new accessory gearbox, Goodrich&#x27;s new distributed control system, and Techspace Aero&#x27;s new oil system were also fitted.

=== Advanced Low-Pressure System (ALPS) ===
After flight tests in 2014 of CTi fan blades with a titanium leading edge and carbon casing, they had indoor and outdoor tests in 2017, including crosswind, noise and tip clearance studies, flutter mapping, performance and icing conditions trials.
In late 2018 Rolls-Royce has ground tested its ALPS demonstrator: a Trent 1000 fitted with composite fan blades and case, including bird strike trials.

=== Advance ===

On 26 February 2014, Rolls-Royce detailed its Trent future developments. The Advance is the first design, which could be ready from the end of the 2020s and aims to offer at least 20% better fuel burn than the first generation of Trents. The Advance bypass ratio should exceed 11:1 and its overall pressure ratio 60:1.

In previous Trents, the HP spool was similar in all models and the engine grew by increasing the intermediate pressure spool&#x27;s work. The Advance reverses this trend and the load is shifted towards the high pressure spool, with a greater pressure ratio, up to 10 compressor stages compared to 6 on the Trent XWB and a two-stage turbine replacing the current single-stage. The IP compressor will shrink from the 8 stages of today&#x27;s XWB to 4 and the IP turbine will be single- rather than of two stages.

The Advance3 ground-based demonstrator includes lean burn, run before on a Trent architecture only; ceramic matrix composite (CMC) for turbine high-temperature capability in the first stage seal segments and cast-bond first stage vanes; hybrid ball bearings with ceramic rollers running on metallic races, required to manage high load environments inside smaller cores.

Opened in 2016, R-R&#x27;s $30 million CMC facility in California produced its first parts, seals, for the start of their deployment before being used in the static components of the second-stage HP turbine. The twin fuel-distribution system in the lean-burn combustor adds complexity with a sophisticated control and switching system and doubles the pipework but should improve fuel consumption and reduce  emissions. Hybrid ceramic bearings are newly configured to deal with loading changes and will cope with higher temperatures.

More variable vanes in one IP and four HP compressor stages will be optimised for constant changes through the flight envelope. An air pipe is produced by additive manufacturing and prototype components come from new suppliers. The Advance3 will survey bearing load, water ingestion, noise sources and their mitigation, heat and combustor rumble while blade-tip, internal clearances and adaptive control operation are radiographed in-motion to verify the thermo-mechanical modelling. The Boeing New Midsize Airplane needs falls in its thrust range. Advanced cooled metallic components and ceramic matrix composite parts will be tested in a late 2018 demonstrator based on a Trent XWB-97 within the high temperature turbine technology (HT3) initiative.

The core will be combined with a Trent XWB-84 fan and a Trent 1000 LP turbine for mid-2017 ground testing. The Advance3 demonstrator was sent from the Bristol production facility to the Derby test stand in July 2017 to be evaluated until early 2018. The demonstrator began initial runs at Derby in November 2017.

In early 2018, the demonstrator attained 90% core power, reaching a P30 pressure at the rear of the compressor, while measuring bearing loads, changed by the different compressor arrangement. The lean burn combustor did not generate any rumble as further tests will cover water ingestion, noise, X-rays of the engine operating, and core-zone and hot-end thermal surveys. By July 2018, the Advance3 core ran at full power. By early 2019, the engine had run over 100 hours.

=== Advanced low-emission combustion system (ALECSys) ===

A standalone engine will test the ALECSys on ground before another will be flight tested. Indoor ground tests of the lean-burn combustor were concluded on a modified Trent 1000 in January 2018, before being sent to Manitoba for cold-weather trials in February 2018, covering start-ups and ice ingestion. Noise testing will follow on an outside rig, then flight tests in the next couple of years after 2018.

=== UltraFan ===

The UltraFan is a geared turbofan with a variable pitch fan system that promises at least 25% efficiency improvement. The UltraFan aims for a 15:1 bypass ratio and 70:1 overall pressure ratio.

The Ultrafan keeps the Advance core, but also contains a geared turbofan architecture with variable-pitch fan blades. The fan varies pitch to optimise for each flight phase, eliminating the need for a thrust reverser. Rolls-Royce planned to use carbon composite fan blades instead of its usual hollow titanium blades. The combination was expected to reduce weight by per engine.

The variable pitch fan facilitates low pressure ratio fan operability. Rolls-Royce worked with Industria de Turbo Propulsores to test ion plating (IP) turbine blade technologies. In Dahlewitz near Berlin, Rolls-Royce built a power rig simulating loading conditions in flight, sized for gear systems; and recruited 200 engineers. The ratio of the initial test gear will approach 4:1 and thrust could be up to . The test rig is an €84 million ($94 million) investment.

In partnership with Liebherr, the UltraFan gearbox was first run in October 2016. After the initial set of low-speed fan rig tests and the casting of second-generation titanium aluminide IP turbine blades, the initial UltraFan demonstrator concept design was to be frozen in 2017. Tests simulated aircraft pitch and roll on an attitude rig in September 2016 to assess oil flow in the gearbox. The gearbox went through high-power tests in May 2017. The UltraFan was to be in diameter. Fan blades with titanium leading edges were evaluated under the ALPS programme.

At the September 2017 International Society for Air Breathing Engines (ISABE) conference in Manchester, UK, Rolls-Royce&#x27;s Chief Technology Officer Paul Stein announced it reached . In early 2018, a third gearbox was tested for endurance and reliability. The first gearbox was then disassembled for evaluation, confirming the component&#x27;s performance predictions. In April 2018, Airbus agreed to provide aircraft integration and its nacelle and for flight testing, co-funded by the European Union research programme Clean Sky 2.

At the April 2018 ILA Berlin Air Show, flight testing was confirmed on Rolls-Royce&#x27;s Boeing 747-200. The demonstrator generated of thrust, exploiting current testing on the Advance 3 and the gearbox. Fan diameter could be up to , compared to the Trent XWB&#x27;s and the GE9X&#x27;s .

Higher bypass and lower fan pressure ratio induce low-speed fan instability that is remedied by variable-pitch blades instead of a variable area jet nozzle. Along with eliminating the thrust reverser, a short, slim nacelle is lighter and less draggy, but in reverse-thrust the flow is distorted, turning the nozzle into the bypass duct, and then partly reversed again into the intermediate compressor. The large fan could lead to gull-wing airframes. By July 2018, the UltraFan configuration was frozen. Detailed design and component manufacture was set to enable 2021 ground tests. The diameter planetary gearbox has five planet gears, is sized to power turbofans and amassed over 250 hours of run time by early 2019.

In February 2019, introduction was delayed until 2027, to re-engine current aircraft, after full-scale ground tests in 2021. A variable-pitch fan or a more electric architecture would be needed beyond the 25% improvement over the Trent 800, for the 2030s-2040s. A integrated starter-generator on the shaft cold end would allow a smaller accessory drive. It could drive an aft-fuselage boundary layer suction fan for a 35% better efficiency gain.

By February 2020, Rolls-Royce was manufacturing the diameter carbon fibre fan blades in Bristol, UK, saving with the composite fan case up to on a twinjet. By March 2022, Rolls-Royce had transferred the power gearbox, tested to , from Dahlewitz to its UK site for assembly,

By May 2023, the first run was made with an demonstrator having a 14:1 bypass ratio, carbon-titanium fan blades, an Advance3 core and a new combustor. With 10% better fuel efficiency than the Trent XWB, the architecture could cover a thrust range for single- or twin-aisles in the 2030s.

In November 2023, it was announced that the demonstrator had achieved at least in maximum power tests, exceeding the design brief of 80,000lbf and had accumulated over 70 hours of run-time.

At the 2024 Farnborough Air Show, Rolls-Royce announced upgrades to its Trent engines, with some enhancements drawing on the UltraFan technology demonstrator project.

<doc id="435200" wikidata="Q2442127" url="?curid=435200" title="Miles Gordon Technology">
<text>Miles Gordon Technology, known as MGT, was a small British company, initially specialising in high-quality add-ons for the ZX Spectrum home computer. It was founded in June 1986 in Cambridge, England by Alan Miles and Bruce Gordon, former employees of Sinclair Research, after Sinclair sold the rights for the Spectrum to Amstrad. They moved to Swansea, Wales, in May 1989, became a public company in July 1989 and went into receivership in June 1990.

== The DISCiPLE and +D ==
As the ZX Spectrum became hugely popular, the lack of a mass storage system became a problem for more serious users. While Sinclair&#x27;s response, the ZX Interface 1 and ZX Microdrive, was very cheap and technologically innovative, it was also rather limited. Many companies developed interfaces to connect floppy disk drives to the ZX Spectrum, one of the most successful being the Opus Discovery; however, these were all to some degree incompatible with Sinclair&#x27;s system.

MGT&#x27;s approach was different. It produced two different floppy-disk interfaces for the Spectrum, first the DISCiPLE (marketed by Rockfort Products) and later the cut-down +D interface (marketed by MGT themselves). Both, however, shared certain features:

* A Shugart-compatible port for connecting one or two floppy diskette drives (the &quot;de facto&quot; standard created by Shugart Associates)
* A parallel printer port
* A &quot;magic button&quot;

The latter generated a non-maskable interrupt, freezing any software running on the Spectrum and allowing it to be saved to disk. This made it simple to store tape-based games on disk, to take screenshots and to enter cheat codes. A duplicate expansion connector at the back allowed other peripherals to be daisy chained, although the complexity of the DISCiPLE meant that many would not work correctly.

However, the real innovation was in the ROM. Unlike most of the competing systems, this was compatible with the Sinclair&#x27;s extended ROM, meaning that the same BASIC commands used to operate Microdrives or the ZX Printer now could control floppy disk drives or a standard parallel printer. As well as being BASIC-compatible, it also mimicked the machine code entry points in the ZX Interface 1 - the so-called &quot;hook codes&quot;. This meant that any Microdrive-specific software could use floppy disk drives connected to MGT interfaces instead without modification, provided the hook codes were used. The floppy drives simply appeared to Microdrive-aware applications to be very big, fast Microdrives.

Sinclair&#x27;s Microdrive command syntax was so complex that a selling point of many disk interfaces was that their commands were simpler. While loading from tape required a simple:

 LOAD &quot;progname&quot;

the equivalent Microdrive syntax was:

 LOAD *&quot;m&quot;;1;&quot;progname&quot;

Given the complexity of entering punctuation on the Spectrum&#x27;s tiny keyboard, this was cumbersome. In addition to supporting the Sinclair syntax, MGT&#x27;s code reduced the command to:

 LOAD d1&quot;progname&quot;

Later, MGT produced the Lifetime Drive range of floppy disk drives (later named Universal Drive after concerns about warranty expectations). The drive was advertised as being compatible with major systems on the market at the time and comprised four models (3.5&quot; and 5.25&quot;, with and without their own power supplies). Compatibility with various machines was achieved using a DIP switch and computer-specific cables.

==The SAM Coupé==
MGT started working on their own home computer, the SAM Coupé, early on, while profits from MGT&#x27;s other product financed its development. The SAM was essentially a ZX Spectrum 48K-compatible system with enhanced graphics and sound, more interfaces, expanded memory and a new BASIC interpreter. The machine was eventually launched late in 1989. While technically advanced, it arrived too late to establish a market and resulted in the company&#x27;s demise. The rights to the +D interface were sold to Datel Electronics Limited in an effort to finance the SAM Coupé. Alan Miles and Bruce Gordon bought the assets of MGT to form Sam Computers. However, that was a temporary reprieve and that company also ceased trading in 1992.

<text>Kanotix, also referred to as KANOTIX, is an operating system based on Debian, with advanced hardware detection. It can run from an optical disc drive or other media i.e. USB-stick without using a hard disk drive.

Kanotix uses KDE Software Compilation as the default desktop environment. Since 2013 the newer releases ship with LXDE as a second lightweight desktop environment. Unlike other similar Linux-distributions Kanotix is a rolling release. Nightly builds are automated builds every night of the latest development code of KANOTIX and with the latest packages from the repositories. The name &quot;Kanotix&quot; is derived from the founder&#x27;s nickname &quot;Kano&quot;. Kanotix&#x27;s mascot is a fangtooth.

==Content==
Kanotix is based on the newest Debian stable. It also provides its own packages and scripts and many backports.
Kanotix also provides an optimized kernel with additional patches.

==Usage==
Kanotix is designed for multiple-purpose usage so that it can be used in live mode on different types of media (DVD, hard disk, and USB flash drive) and includes an installation tool for installing Kanotix to the hard drive. The distribution ships with the latest kernel which is carefully patched with fixes and drivers for most modern hardware. Kanotix is an ideal tool for testing, data rescue, or for working and safe surfing and mailing on different machines e.g. in an Internet cafe.

===Live mode===
The Live mode allows it to work without any installation. As Kanotix comes with unionfs and aufs-support one can &quot;install&quot; additional packages by using APT (via connection to the Internet).
For USB-users the so-called &quot;persistent mode&quot; allows to save data changes back to the USB storage device and the stored data and customized settings can be used again on following boots. Using USB flash drive (when supported by BIOS), is of course much faster than booting from CD or DVD.

===Installation===
Kanotix can be installed to the hard disk using the (graphical) acritoxinstaller, which, depending on optical drive, hard disk and processor speed, can take around 10–20 minutes.
The acritoxinstaller is a KDE/Qt frontend and a bash backend and comes with a user-friendly interface and several advanced features: e.g. LVM support, dmraid support, automatic partitioning (including ntfsresize-support), installation to USB-HDDs.

==Versions==

===History (2003–2006)===
The distribution derived from &quot;Kano&#x27;s Scriptpage for Knoppix&quot;. He wrote about Knoppix: &quot;I like it much, but I had to improve it :)&quot;. One of the main differences from Knoppix was the support of hard disk installation.
The first &quot;Kanotix&quot;-preview was released at 24 December 2003 &quot;KANOTIX XMAS 2003 PREVIEW&quot;.
In 2004 and 2005 KANOTIX was a popular distribution ranking in the top 20 of distrowatch.com. In 2004 the releases were named &quot;Bug Hunter&quot; (Bug Hunter-01-2004 - X-2004).

After problems with the stability in 2006 Jörg &quot;Kano&quot; Schirottke decided to move from Debian Sid to a less volatile basis.
The co-developer and other of the Kanotix-Team wanted to stay with Debian-Sid and left the project, to start sidux, a new distribution based on Debian sid. The last Kanotix release based on Debian Sid was 2006-01-RC4.

===Versions based on Debian stable (2007–current)===

====Kanotix-Thorhammer-Release 2007====
The first Release based on Debian-stable was the Kanotix-Thorhammer in 2007. After the Debian-Etch-Release in April 2007 Kanotix was no longer compatible with Debian Sid. So a Howto was given, &quot;Steps to update right&quot;, to move a KANOTIX-installation to the new base by dist-upgrade.

After 3 months of development and several beta Releases the new &quot;Kanotix-2007-Thorhammer-RC6&quot; was publicly available for download.
The last published version was &quot;Kanotix-2007-Thorhammer-RC7&quot;.
The &quot;development in 2008&quot; featured continuously kernel-updates and a lot of backports in the Thorhammer-repository.
Some of the additional packages were adaptations for netbooks and notebooks. A highlighted additional backport was OpenOffice.org 3.2.x

====Kanotix-Excalibur-2010====

The (old) stable Release 2010 &quot;Kanotix-Excalibur&quot; was based on Debian 5 (&quot;Lenny&quot;) and had compared to Thorhammer some basic changes (based on Debian-Live, bootloader Grub2). Furthermore, Kanotix-Excalibur was available for 32-Bit and 64-Bit architecture and a 2in1 iso with both. Additionally there are Kanotix Excalibur 2010 KDE4 (KDE SC 4.3.2) versions available and an &quot;all-in-one&quot;-DVD.iso. Kanotix-Excalibur contains the more up-to-date Ubuntu-kernels 2.6.32-BFS with special patches. During the development most of the Kanotix-Excalibur-test.iso were not published but accessible to the community. A first &quot;Preview&quot;-Version was published on December 27, 2009. The final &quot;Kanotix-Excalibur-2010&quot; was released on 8 June 2010, just in time for LinuxTag 2010.

====Kanotix-Hellfire-2011-2012====

The next stable version, code-name &quot;Kanotix-Hellfire&quot; is based on Debian 6 (&quot;Squeeze&quot;). It ships with KDE Software Compilation 4 for 32-Bit and 64-Bit architecture and a complete new branding stuff, new kernel (2.6.38), LibreOffice 3.3.2 and more.
An updated version &quot;Kanotix-Hellfire 2011-05&quot; was released with the project&#x27;s presentation at LinuxTag 2011 in Berlin
and again with version &quot;Kanotix-Hellfire 2012-05&quot; one year later during the LinuxTag 2012
With the so-called &quot;GFX overlays&quot; that enables to use Nvidia or ATI 3D graphics driver in live mode, Kanotix-Hellfire provides this new feature first time.

====Kanotix-Dragonfire-2012-2014====

This version, (&quot;old stable&quot;) code-name &quot;Kanotix-Dragonfire&quot; is based on Debian 7 (&quot;Wheezy&quot;). A Preview of this Kanotix-Version was offered at LinuxTag 2012 in several versions in 32 and 64 bit. Also a new repository for Kanotix-Dragonfire was added with backported KDE4.8 packages (amd64 and i386).
New features in Kanotix-Dragonfire are: booting from/with DVD, USB, UEFI (PCs, Intel Macs), an embedded USB-Stick ImageWriter for Mac OS X and the USB-Stick with Hybrid-ISO can now be made persistent from the live-system.

A preview of the current release &quot;Kanotix-acritox-trialshot&quot; was announced on 14 February 2013. A special &quot;CeBIT&quot; edition was released &quot;as a Technology Demonstration&quot; on 8 March 2013.

A new official Kanotix-Dragonfire was announced from LinuxTag 2013 in Berlin. Beside KDE as default desktop environment the new release ships with LXDE as a second lightweight desktop environment.
In the KDE-Special version the extra 3D graphics drivers from nvidia and AMD and the Steam-client are already preinstalled.

An updated release of the stable Kanotix was presented at LinuxTag 2014 in Berlin.

====Kanotix-Spitfire-2014-2016====

&quot;Kanotix Spitfire&quot; is based on Debian 8 (&quot;Jessie&quot;). Several Kanotix-LinuxTag images for 32 and 64 bit were offered for download.
After the Release of Debian GNU/Linux 8.0 (2015-04-26) a reset of the &quot;nightly builds&quot; with the official Debian kernel-version 3.16.7 started &quot;Kanotix-Spitfire&quot; as a &quot;rolling release&quot; of the current stable &quot;Kanotix&quot;. The Images are maintained by developer Kano and offered for download &quot;Kanotix Downloads&quot; and on kanotix.acritox.com
The latest Kanotix modification of &quot;Kanotix-Spitfire&quot; has been presented at OpenRheinRuhr 2015 in Oberhausen.

====Kanotix-Steelfire-2017-2019====

&quot;Kanotix Steelfire&quot; is based on current stable Debian 9 (&quot;Stretch&quot;). 
Two months after the Release of Debian GNU/Linux 9.0 (2017-06-17) the first iso-images of Kanotix-steelfire-nightly-LXDE were released. The KDE-modification of &quot;Kanotix-Spitfire&quot; was releast and presented later at OpenRheinRuhr 2017 in Oberhausen. (2017-11-4/5)
All Images of &quot;Kanotix-Steelfire&quot; are available as KDE and LXDE versions in 32 and 64 bit.

====Kanotix-Silverfire-2019-2020====

&quot;Kanotix-Silverfire&quot; is based on Debian 10 (&quot;Buster&quot;). Just like its Debian base Kanotix-Silverfire was in the &quot;testing&quot;-mode. Some &quot;previews&quot; with KDE and LXDE in 32- and 64-bit variants are linked on the homepage. With the Release of Debian-10 (Buster), Kanotix-Silverfire became stable too.

====Kanotix-Slowfire-2024====

&quot;Kanotix-Slowfire&quot; is a edition based on Debian 12 (&quot;Bookworm&quot;). Just like the earlier Kanotix-Images the Nightly-Builds are released in 5 versions: The KDE and LXDE desktop environment, both in 64 and 32 Bit and the small Kanotix-Image -eeepc4G. In the KANOTIX tradition of rolling-release the Nightly-builds are automated builds every night of the latest development and the latest packages from the repositories. New is the Calamares-Installer (now in test version), wayland, refind, the current LibreOffice and a new kernel (6.6-13.1).

<doc id="435203" wikidata="Q546264" url="?curid=435203" title="Beat music">
<text>Beat music, British beat, or Merseybeat is a British popular music genre and developed around Liverpool in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The genre melded influences from British and American rock and roll, rhythm and blues, skiffle, traditional pop and music hall. It rose to mainstream popularity in the United Kingdom and Europe by 1963 before spreading to North America in 1964 with the British Invasion. The beat style had a significant impact on popular music and youth culture from 1960s movements such as garage rock, folk rock and psychedelic music.

==Origin==
The exact origins of the terms &#x27;beat music&#x27; and &#x27;Merseybeat&#x27; are uncertain. The &quot;beat&quot; in each, however, derived from the driving rhythms which the bands had adopted from their rock and roll, R&amp;B and soul music influences, rather than the Beat Generation literary movement of the 1950s. As the initial wave of rock and roll subsided in the later 1950s, &quot;big beat&quot; music, later shortened to &quot;beat&quot;, became a live dance alternative to the balladeers like Tommy Steele, Marty Wilde, and Cliff Richard who were dominating the charts. The German anthropologist and music critic Ernest Borneman, who lived in England from 1933 to 1960, claimed to have coined the term in a column in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine to describe the British imitation of American rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, rhythm &amp; blues and skiffle bands.

The &#x27;Mersey&#x27; of &#x27;Merseybeat&#x27; refers to the River Mersey. Liverpool lies on the eastern side of the river&#x27;s estuary.

The name &quot;Mersey Beat&quot; was used for a Liverpool music magazine founded in 1961 by Bill Harry. Harry claims to have coined the term &quot;based on a policeman&#x27;s beat and not that of the music&quot;. The band the Pacifics were renamed the Mersey Beats in February 1962 by Bob Wooler, MC at the Cavern Club, and in April that year they became the Merseybeats. With the rise of the Beatles in 1963, the terms Mersey sound and Merseybeat were applied to bands and singers from Liverpool, the first time in British pop music that a sound and a location were linked together. The equivalent scenes in Birmingham and London were described as Brum Beat and the Tottenham Sound respectively.

==Characteristics==
The most distinctive characteristic of beat music was its strong beat, using the backbeat common to rock and roll and rhythm and blues, but often with a driving emphasis on all the beats of 4/4 bar. The rhythm itself—described by Alan Clayson as &quot;a changeless four-four offbeat on the snare drum&quot;—was developed in the clubs in Hamburg, West Germany, where many English groups, including the Beatles, performed in the early 1960s and where it was known as the &quot;mach schau&quot; (make show) beat. The 8/8 rhythm was flexible enough to be adopted for songs from a range of genres. In addition, according to music writer Dave Laing,

&quot;[T]he chord playing of the rhythm guitar was broken up into a series of separate strokes, often one to the bar, with the regular plodding of the bass guitar and crisp drumming behind it. This gave a very different effect from the monolithic character of rock, in that the beat was given not by the duplication of one instrument in the rhythm section by another, but by an interplay between all three. This flexibility also meant that beat music could cope with a greater range of time-signatures and song shapes than rock &amp; roll had been able to&quot;.

Beat groups usually had simple guitar-dominated line-ups, with vocal harmonies and catchy tunes. The most common instrumentation of beat groups featured lead, rhythm and bass guitars plus drums, as popularised by the Beatles, the Searchers, and others. Beat groups—even those with a separate lead singer—often sang both verses and choruses in close harmony, resembling doo wop, with nonsense syllables in the backing vocals.

==Emergence==

In the late 1950s, a flourishing culture of groups began to emerge, often out of the declining skiffle scene, in major urban centres in the UK like Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and London. This was particularly true in Liverpool, where it has been estimated that there were around 350 different bands active, often playing ballrooms, concert halls and clubs. Liverpool was perhaps uniquely placed within Britain to be the point of origin of a new form of music. Commentators have pointed to a combination of local solidarity, industrial decline, social deprivation, and the existence of a large population of Irish origin, the influence of which has been detected in Beat music. It was also a major port with links to America, particularly through the Cunard Yanks, which made for much greater access to American records and instruments like guitars, which could not easily be imported due to trade restrictions. As a result, Beat bands were heavily influenced by American groups of the era, such as Buddy Holly and the Crickets (from which group the Beatles derived their name, combining it with a pun on the beat in their music), and to a lesser extent by British rock and roll groups such as the Shadows.

After the national success of the Beatles in Britain from 1962, a number of Liverpool performers were able to follow them into the charts, including Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers (who achieved a number one hit in the UK before the Beatles), the Searchers, and Cilla Black.

Outside of Liverpool many local scenes were less influenced by rock and roll and more by the rhythm and blues and later directly by the blues. These included bands from Birmingham who were often grouped with the beat movement, the most successful being the Spencer Davis Group and the Moody Blues. Similar blues influenced bands who broke out from local scenes to national prominence were the Animals from Newcastle and Them from Belfast. From London, the term &quot;Tottenham Sound&quot; was largely based around the Dave Clark Five, but other London-based British rhythm and blues and rock bands who benefited from the beat boom of this era included the Rolling Stones, the Kinks and the Yardbirds.

===British Invasion===
The Beatles&#x27; appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; soon after led to chart success. During the next two years, the Animals, Petula Clark, the Dave Clark Five, the Rolling Stones, Donovan, Peter and Gordon, Manfred Mann, Freddie and the Dreamers, The Zombies, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, and the Troggs would have one or more number one singles in America.

=== Freakbeat ===

Freakbeat is a subgenre of rock and roll music developed mainly by harder-driving British groups, often those with a mod following during the Swinging London period of the mid to late 1960s. Freakbeat bridges &quot;British Invasion mod/R&amp;B/pop and psychedelia&quot;. The term was coined by English music journalist Phil Smee. AllMusic writes that &quot;freakbeat&quot; is loosely defined, but generally describes the more obscure but hard-edged artists of the British Invasion era such as the Creation, the Pretty Things or Denny Laine&#x27;s early solo work. Other bands often mentioned as Freakbeat are the Action, the Move, the Smoke, the Sorrows, and Wimple Winch.

==Decline==
By 1967, beat music was beginning to sound out of date, particularly compared with the &quot;harder edged&quot; blues rock that was beginning to emerge.

Most of the groups that had not already disbanded by 1967, like the Beatles, moved into different forms of rock music and pop music, including psychedelic rock and eventually progressive rock.

==Influence==
Beat was a major influence on the American garage rock and folk rock movements, and would be a source of inspiration for subsequent rock music subgenres, including Britpop in the 1990s.

<text>Lawrence Martin Jenco, OSM (27 November 1934 – 19 July 1996), was an American Catholic priest famous for being held hostage in Beirut, Lebanon by Islamic radicals. He was held captive for 564 days before being released and allowed to return to the United States. He was a member of the Servite Order. 

==Early life and education==
Lawrence Jenco was born in Joliet, Illinois on November 27, 1934, in a family of Slovak descent. He went to grade school at St. Bernard’s parish in Joliet. In high school, he studied at Mount Carmel College in Niagara Falls, Canada (of the Carmelites) and at St. Joseph Seminary in St. Charles, Illinois (of the Servites). He entered the novitiate in 1950. Afterwards, he studied philosophy at Our Lady of Riverside Seminary in Riverside, California and theology at Collegio Internazionale Sant&#x27;Alessio in Rome, Italy. In 1959, he was ordained as a priest in Rome.

In 1981, he began working for the Catholic Relief Services overseas, initially being sent to North Yemen. He was reassigned to Bangkok, Thailand in 1983. He arrived in Beirut, Lebanon in 1984.

==Kidnapping==
Jenco was taken hostage in Beirut by five armed men on January 8, 1985, while serving as director of Catholic Relief Services there.

In his book &quot;Bound to Forgive&quot;, Jenco relives his kidnapping and imprisonment, and offers portraits of the Shiite Muslims who held him captive. He also discusses how his faith sustained him. He spent much of his time in prayer and meditation, making a rosary out of threads from a sack, and celebrated clandestine Masses whenever he could. At times, he was imprisoned with other hostages (such as Terry A. Anderson and Benjamin Weir) who worshipped together as &quot;The Church of the Locked Door&quot;.

Jenco spent much of his time chained and blindfolded, and was allowed to use the toilet only once a day. He suffered serious eye infections and other health problems as a result of his captivity. In changing from one hiding place to another, he was bound with tape and placed in stifling hiding places in trucks, lest he be found by soldiers or police inspecting a vehicle. He also suffered beatings by the guards.

===Release===
After a period of 18 months&#x27; imprisonment, Jenco was freed on July 26, 1986, after months of negotiations involving the Reagan Administration, Shiite radicals and the Anglican envoy Terry Waite, who was himself later held hostage in Beirut for four and a half years.

Toward the end of his captivity, Jenco was asked by one of his guards if he forgave his captors. Jenco tells in his book that at that moment he realised that he was being called to forgive, to &quot;let go of revenge, retaliation and vindictiveness&quot;. Jenco received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award for his capacity to forgive his captors having been held hostage for 18 months and tortured by religious extremists in Beirut.

He became campus minister at the University of Southern California following his release. In 1995, Jenco wrote the book &quot;Bound to Forgive: the Pilgrimage to Reconciliation of a Beirut Hostage&quot;.

== Death and legacy ==
In 1996, Jenco died of pancreatic and lung cancer in the rectory of St. Domitilla Church in Hillside, Illinois. He is buried in the Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.

In 2001, federal judge Royce Lamberth awarded the estate and family of Jenco $314.6 million in damages from Iran for the period he was held hostage in Lebanon. The ruling includes $14.6 million in compensatory damages to Jenco and his six siblings or their estates and $300 million in punitive damages. Jenco &quot;was treated little better than a caged animal&quot; said Lamberth in his ruling, which laid the blame upon the Iranian government. The Iranian government defaulted on the lawsuit, declining to answer any of the allegations. Victims of foreign terrorism are allowed by law to collect court judgments from the U.S. government.

The Father Lawrence Jenco Foundation was founded by fellow hostage and friend Terry A. Anderson in 2001. It seeks to support people doing faith-based charitable work in Appalachia.

<text>The Greater Manila Area () is the contiguous urbanization region surrounding the Metropolitan Manila area. This built-up zone includes Metro Manila and the neighboring provinces of Bulacan to the north, Cavite and Laguna to the south, and Rizal to the east. Though sprawl continues to absorb new zones, some urban zones are independent clusters of settlements surrounded by non-urban areas.

In early 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the area was also referred to as the &quot;NCR Plus&quot; or &quot;NCR+&quot; (National Capital Region Plus) by authorities, with regard to the designation of community quarantines.

== Statistics ==

The Greater Manila Area is composed with 34 cities (16 highly urbanized cities, and 18 component cities) and 74 municipalities.

<text>The Meissel–Mertens constant (named after Ernst Meissel and Franz Mertens), also referred to as the Mertens constant, Kronecker&#x27;s constant (after Leopold Kronecker), Hadamard–de la Vallée-Poussin constant (after Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin), or the prime reciprocal constant, is a mathematical constant in number theory, defined as the limiting difference between the harmonic series summed only over the primes and the natural logarithm of the natural logarithm:

:formula_1

Here γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant, which has an analogous definition involving a sum over all integers (not just the primes).
The value of &quot;M&quot; is approximately
:&quot;M&quot; ≈ 0.2614972128476427837554268386086958590516... .

Mertens&#x27; second theorem establishes that the limit exists.

The fact that there are two logarithms (log of a log) in the limit for the Meissel–Mertens constant may be thought of as a consequence of the combination of the prime number theorem and the limit of the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

==In popular culture==

The Meissel-Mertens constant was used by Google when bidding in the Nortel patent auction. Google posted three bids based on mathematical numbers: $1,902,160,540 (Brun&#x27;s constant), $2,614,972,128 (Meissel–Mertens constant), and $3.14159 billion (π).

<doc id="435217" wikidata="Q426805" url="?curid=435217" title="Enigmail">
<text>Enigmail is a data encryption and decryption extension for Mozilla Thunderbird and the Postbox that provides OpenPGP public key e-mail encryption and signing. Enigmail works under Microsoft Windows, Unix-like, and Mac OS X operating systems. Enigmail can operate with other mail clients compatible with PGP/MIME and inline PGP such as: Microsoft Outlook with Gpg4win package installed, Gnome Evolution, KMail, Claws Mail, Gnus, Mutt. Its cryptographic functionality is handled by GNU Privacy Guard.

In their default configuration, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey provide e-mail encryption and signing using S/MIME, which relies on X.509 keys provided by a centralised certificate authority. Enigmail adds an alternative mechanism where cooperating users can instead use keys provided by a web of trust, which relies on multiple users to endorse the authenticity of the sender&#x27;s and recipient&#x27;s credentials. In principle this enhances security, since it does not rely on a centralised entity which might be compromised by security failures or engage in malpractice due to commercial interests or pressure from the jurisdiction in which it resides.

Enigmail was first released in 2001 by Ramalingam Saravanan, and since 2003 maintained by Patrick Brunschwig. Both Enigmail and GNU Privacy Guard are free, open-source software. Enigmail with Thunderbird is now the most popular PGP setup.

Enigmail has announced its support for the new &quot;pretty Easy privacy&quot; (p≡p) encryption scheme in a joint Thunderbird extension to be released in December 2015. As of June 2016 the FAQ note it will be available in Q3 2016.

Enigmail also supports Autocrypt exchange of cryptographic keys since version 2.0.

In October 2019, the developers of Thunderbird announced built-in support for encryption and signing based on OpenPGP Thunderbird 78 to replace the Enigmail add-on. The background is a change in the code base of Thunderbird, removing support for legacy add-ons. Since this would require a rewrite from scratch for Enigmail, Patrick Brunschwig instead supports the Thunderbird team in a native implementation in Thunderbird. Enigmail will be maintained for Thunderbird 68 until 6 months after the release of Thunderbird 78. The support of Enigmail for Postbox will be unaffected.

<doc id="435229" wikidata="Q4050371" url="?curid=435229" title="Sun Enterprise">
<text>Sun Enterprise is a range of UNIX server computers produced by Sun Microsystems from 1996 to 2001. The line was launched as the Sun Ultra Enterprise series; the &quot;Ultra&quot; prefix was dropped around 1998. These systems are based on the 64-bit UltraSPARC microprocessor architecture and related to the contemporary Ultra series of computer workstations. Like the Ultra series, they run Solaris. Various models, from single-processor entry-level servers to large high-end multiprocessor servers were produced. The Enterprise brand was phased out in favor of the Sun Fire model line from 2001 onwards.

== Ultra workstation-derived servers ==
The first UltraSPARC-I-based servers produced by Sun, launched in 1995, are the UltraServer 1 and UltraServer 2. These are server configurations of the Ultra 1 and Ultra 2 workstations respectively. These were later renamed Ultra Enterprise 1 and Ultra Enterprise 2 for consistency with other server models. Later these were joined by the Ultra Enterprise 150, which comprises an Ultra 1 motherboard in a tower-style enclosure with 12 internal disk bays.

In 1998, Sun launched server configurations of the UltraSPARC-IIi-based Ultra 5 and Ultra 10 workstations, called the Enterprise Ultra 5S and Enterprise Ultra 10S respectively.

== Entry-level servers ==

The Sun Enterprise 450 is a rack-mountable entry-level multiprocessor server launched in 1997, capable of up to four UltraSPARC II processors. The Sun Enterprise 250 is a two-processor version launched in 1998. These were later joined by the Enterprise 220R and Enterprise 420R rack-mount servers in 1999. The 220R and 420R models are respectively based on the motherboards of the Ultra 60 and Ultra 80 workstations. The 250 was replaced by the Sun Fire V250, the 450 by the Sun Fire V880. The 220R was superseded by the Sun Fire 280R and the 420R by the Sun Fire V480.

==Ultra Enterprise XX00 mid-range servers==

In 1996, Sun replaced the SPARCserver 1000E and SPARCcenter 2000E models with the Ultra Enterprise 3000, 4000, 5000 and 6000 servers. These are multiprocessor servers based on a common hardware architecture incorporating the &quot;Gigaplane&quot; packet-switched processor/memory bus and UltraSPARC-I or II processors. High availability and fault-tolerance features are included in the X000 systems which are intended for mission-critical applications.

The 3000 model is a deskside server configurable with up to six processors and 10 internal disks, while the 4000 is a rack-mount system with up to 14 processors. The 5000 is essentially a 4000 in a rack cabinet and the 6000 is a cabinet-housed data center server with up to 30 processors.

In 1999, the Enterprise 3500, 4500, 5500 and 6500 models were announced. These are upgraded X000 systems, with a faster Gigaplane bus (up to 100 MHz, depending on processor clock speed, compared to 83 MHz). The 3500 also differs from the 3000 by having an additional Gigaplane slot resulting in an increased maximum of eight processors. The Enterprise X500 series were replaced by the Sun Fire 3800/4800/6800 line.

==Enterprise 10000==

The Enterprise 10000, E10k or Starfire (a development code name also used for marketing purposes) is a high-end multiprocessor data center server capable of being configured with up to 64 UltraSPARC II processors. This was largely designed by Cray Research&#x27;s Business Systems Division as a successor to the Cray Superserver 6400, itself related to Sun&#x27;s earlier Sun-4d architecture servers. After Cray was acquired by Silicon Graphics in 1996, this division was sold on to Sun, who then launched the &quot;Starfire&quot; as the Ultra Enterprise 10000 in 1997.

The &quot;Starfire&quot; is based around the fault-tolerant &quot;Gigaplane-XB&quot; processor/memory interconnect. Like the X000 and X500 series servers, the &quot;Starfire&quot; incorporates many high-availability features, including the ability to be partitioned into multiple &quot;domains&quot;, each of which can be booted individually to run its own instance of Solaris. It is also possible to remove resources from a running domain with short notice and reassign freed resources to other domains. Domain granularity is one CPU board (single system may have 1-16 of them). A single CPU board can carry up to 4 processors, 4GB of RAM and 4 SBUS IO boards. A rare option is to replace 4 SBUS boards with dual PCI boards. The &quot;Starfire&quot; is the first server from any vendor to exceed 2000 on the TPC-D 300 GB benchmark. &quot;Starfire&quot; systems were used by a number of high-profile customers during the &quot;dot-com&quot; boom, notably eBay, and typically sold for well over $1 million for a fully configured system.

The &quot;Starfire&quot; contains one or two controller modules which are connected via Ethernet to an external computer, the System Service Processor (SSP). The controller modules interface with the system &quot;centerplane&quot; via JTAG and control the partitioning of available CPUs, memory and I/O devices into one or more domains, each of which is in effect a distinct computer. The system cannot be partitioned or booted without its original SSP which contains encrypted keys issued by the manufacturer. An E10K has been preserved at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View.

The &quot;Starfire&quot; was superseded by the Sun Fire 12K/15K models.

<doc id="435236" wikidata="Q2657177" url="?curid=435236" title="Crash cover">
<text>A crash cover is a philatelic term for a type of cover (including the terms air accident cover, interrupted flight cover, wreck cover), meaning an envelope or package that has been recovered from an air crash, train wreck, shipwreck or other accident. Crash covers are a type of interrupted mail.
Crashes of flights carrying airmail were a regular occurrence from the earliest days of mail transport by air. In many cases of aircraft crashes, train wreck and shipwrecks, it was possible to recover some or even all of the mail being carried, with perhaps some charring around the edges of some pieces if there had been a fire, or water damage from flying boat crashes or shipwrecks. In such cases, the authorities typically apply a postal marking (cachet), label, or mimeograph that gets affixed to the cover explaining the delay and damage to the recipient, and possibly enclose the letter in an &quot;ambulance cover&quot; or &quot;body bag&quot; if it was badly damaged and then send it to its intended destination.

Aviation-related crash covers are a specialized collecting area of aerophilately and are much-prized items of postal history, because they are generally rare, but as tangible artifacts of often-tragic accidents they have a story to tell. The 367 covers salvaged from the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster are especially desirable, with prices ranging from US$10,000 and up; a cover at the Corinphila auction in May 2001 realized 85,000 Swiss francs (US$75,000).

The American Air Mail Society has a Crash Cover Committee specializing in the study of crash covers. There is also a Wreck &amp; Crash Mail Society, whose members collect all types of crash and wreck covers.

<doc id="435239" wikidata="Q6942381" url="?curid=435239" title="Music of the Maritimes">
<text>The music of Canada&#x27;s Maritime provinces has included many artists from both the traditional and pop genres, and is mostly European in origin. The traditional genre is dominated by the music brought to the region by the European settlers, the most well known of which are the Scots &amp; Irish celtic and Acadian traditions. Successful pop acts from all genres have had degrees of national and international success since the beginning of recorded music period. Performers as diverse as Hank Snow, Stan Rogers, Anne Murray, the Rankin Family, Barachois, The Men of the Deeps and April Wine have all experienced tremendous success as popular music acts with considerable national and international tours and record sales.

While closely related to the three Maritime provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador is culturally and politically separate. However, the two areas share a regional awards show, the East Coast Music Awards, and a common musical heritage.

==Traditional music==

The Maritime provinces are best known for the strong influence of Scottish and Irish settlers on the sound of the region&#x27;s traditional music. This Celtic derived music is most strongly expressed on Cape Breton Island, which is especially well known for the Scottish influx in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Scottish-style fiddle music, sometimes accompanied by the piano, was popular at the time, and these traditions survive today. In some cases, like Cape Breton Island, Scottish folk traditions are better-maintained than in Scotland itself.

The work of Helen Creighton and Louise Manny is particularly noted for documenting the traditional ballads and sea shanties of the region. The most notable of these songs being Farewell to Nova Scotia. The Miramichi Folksong Festival preserves the lyrics and music of northeastern New Brunswick, especially ballads from 19th and early 20th century lumber camps.

The last two decades of the 20th century saw a revival in Maritime (Celtic music), spurred by a wave of similar roots revivals in Quebec and the rest of Canada, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. The first wave of Maritime traditional music was led by folk artist John Allan Cameron in the 1970s . By the late 1980s, Cape Breton had produced two crossover acts, the multi-platinum selling The Rankins and the less successful but critically acclaimed Barra MacNeils, Ashley MacIsaac, Natalie MacMaster, Lennie Gallant, and Slainte Mhath. Other modern performers have continued to add new influences to traditional Maritime music, including Gaelic lyrics in Mary Jane Lamond&#x27;s &quot;Suas e!&quot;, Western classical music in Puirt a Baroque&#x27;s &quot;Bach Meets Cape Breton&quot; and Middle Eastern musical influences in Laurel MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Chroma&quot;. 

New Brunswick has seen a roots revival of their own Acadian traditions, dating back to before they were expelled to from Acadia. In south-eastern New Brunswick, Acadians or creole Chiac play mostly a style of Zydeco music, while other Acadians play a form of Western music and Bluegrass. Barachois is probably the leading band of this revival, while The Gallants and The Arsenaults are two of the most famous Acadien musical families of the East Coast. 

Halifax, Nova Scotia has become a centre for black music in the Maritime provinces, both in the continuation of the traditions of the freed slave and loyalist blacks especially gospel music, and also with music arriving with African immigrants. Gospel groups have included the Gospel Heirs and the Nova Scotia Mass Choir.

==Popular music==
The region has made considerable contribution to national and international popular music, primarily by performers from Nova Scotia, though both New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have made contributions as well. The conscious hip hop movement in The East coast was started in 2010 by a female artist named Amber Aquarius, she shook up the city and was also one of the first female artists there, she created such a buzz and chaos in the male oriented rap scene that she will forever be immortalized in East Coast Hip Hop history.
Amber Aquarius also worked at one of the only hip hop radio stations in Halifax, 88.1 CKDU located at Dalhousie university.

==Heavy metal==
The Maritime provinces are a haven for many heavy metal acts with support for the genre especially strong in New Brunswick. Many new acts are of the death metal/black metal sub-genres, one example being Obscene Eulogy, although all styles are represented.

<text>Zeta is a marque of automobile which was produced in Australia from 1963 to 1965 by South Australian manufacturing company Lightburn &amp; Co.

An established manufacturer of cement mixers and washing machines, Lightburn and Co. built the cars in its factory in the Adelaide suburb of Camden Park. The first Zeta model was introduced in 1963 at a price of £595. Production ceased in 1965 with the last vehicles sold in 1966 and total sales of fewer than 400 vehicles.

==Models==

Zeta cars were produced in the following models:
Lightburn also produced an electric &#x27;mobility-scooter esque&#x27; runabout vehicle capable of carrying 2 adults and available in two models.

==Features==

===Sedan and Utility===

The Zeta Sedan, (also known as the Zeta Runabout) and Utility, were powered by a 324cc Villiers engine and were front wheel drive with independent rear trailing arms. The Sedan was not equipped with a rear hatch so access to the cargo area required removal of the front seats, the ease of which was advertised as a positive feature. The chassis was steel, with a fibreglass body enclosing a large but sparse interior. Windows were perspex except for the front windscreen which was laminated glass. The doors were steel with sliding perspex windows.

The tyres for the Sedan and Utility were Michelin 125 R12 as stated in the specifications. The four speed, dog clutch, Villiers Engineering gearbox had no reverse so the engine had to be switched off and started backwards which provide four reverse gears. Fuel was delivered by gravity feed from a tank behind the dashboard. The fuel gauge was a plastic pipe running from the top to the bottom of the tank with a graduated glass tube section on the dashboard. As a Wheels road test in 1974 put it: &quot;it read anywhere from full to empty depending on gradient, throttle and probably Greenwich mean time&quot;.

The Utility was the rarest of the Zeta models with a total of only 8 produced. A number were purchased by Sydney City Council&#x27;s Hyde Park fleet. The Utility was mechanically identical to the Sedan.

===Sports===

The two-seater Zeta Sports was introduced in 1964. Body styling was based on the Henry Meadows Sprint version of the Frisky microcar, designed by Gordon Bedson and Keith Peckmore, although Lightburn attributed the design to Michelotti. The fibreglass bodied car weighed and ran on 10-inch wheels with all-round drum brakes. Like the Goggomobil Dart it lacked doors and bumper bars. The Zeta Sports was fitted with a West German ZF Sachs F.M.R. 500 498cc two cylinder, two-stroke engine producing . The engine, which had a 70mm bore and a 67mm stroke was originally designed for and used in the 4 wheel FMR Tg500 microcar. The Zeta Sports was fitted with a 4 speed and reverse sequential gearbox in unit with the engine. 48 examples were produced.

==Sales history==

As well as the oddness of the design, the vehicle&#x27;s commercial success was also stymied by unfortunate timing as it was released onto the market at the same time as the Morris Mini, which was only £60 more expensive. As a result, only 363 vehicles were sold from 1963 to 1966, including 28 of the Sports model. According to a sign in the National Motor Museum in Birdwood, South Australia, 48 of the sports model were manufactured.

<doc id="435243" wikidata="Q4263851" url="?curid=435243" title="HMAS Balikpapan">
<text>HMAS &quot;Balikpapan&quot; (L 126) was the lead ship of the of heavy landing craft (LCH). Ordered in 1969, &quot;Balikpapan&quot; entered service with the Australian Army Water Transport Squadron in late 1971. After this, the decision to place all seagoing Army vessels under the control of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) saw &quot;Balikpapan&quot; transferred and commissioned in 1974; the last of the eight-vessel class to enter RAN service. &quot;Balikpapan&quot; was placed in reserve in 1985, but was reactivated three years later. During late 1999 and early 2000, the vessel was part of the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce, and made additional deployments to East Timor in 2001 and 2006. On 12 December 2012, &quot;Balikpapan&quot; was retired from RAN service.

==Design and construction==

The eight-vessel &quot;Balikpapan&quot; class was ordered as a locally manufactured replacement for the Australian Army&#x27;s LSM-1-class landing ship medium and ALC 50 landing craft. They are long, with a beam of , and a draught of . The landing craft have a standard displacement of 316 tons, with a full load displacement of 503 tons. They are propelled by two G.M. Detroit 6-71 diesel motors, providing 675 brake horsepower to the two propeller shafts, allowing the vessels to reach . The standard ship&#x27;s company is 13-strong. The &quot;Balikpapan&quot;s are equipped with a Decca RM 916 navigational radar, and fitted with two machine guns for self-defence.

The LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to 3 Leopard 1 tanks, 13 M113 armoured personnel carriers 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles. As a troop transport, a &quot;Balikpapan&quot;-class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages. The vessel&#x27;s payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of , which increases to with a 150-ton payload, and when unladen. The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages.

&quot;Balikpapan&quot; was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 1 May 1971, launched on 15 August 1971, and assigned to the Australian Army Water Transport Squadron on 8 December 1971. After completing sea trials, &quot;Balikpapan&quot; began full operational service in 1972, with a combined RAN/Army crew.

==Operational history==
In 1972, the decision was made that all Army seagoing vessels would be transferred to the RAN, with the Army retaining control of small landing craft and harbour support vessels. &quot;Balikpapan&quot; was transferred to the RAN and commissioned on 27 September 1974; as the other seven LCHs had commissioned into the RAN on completion, &quot;Balikpapan&quot; was the last to enter naval service.

&quot;Balikpapan&quot; was one of the first ships to depart for Darwin to render assistance after Cyclone Tracy hit that city in December 1974, sailing on 26 December from Brisbane with sister ship .

During May and June 1984, &quot;Balikpapan&quot; completed a transit from Brisbane to Penang, transporting vehicles, equipment, and personnel to RAAF Butterworth. Departing on 28 May, the vessel visited Cairns, Darwin, Jakarta, and Singapore, before unloading at Penang between 23 and 25 June. The landing craft returned via Singapore, Benoa, Darwin, and Cairns, and reached Brisbane on 7 August; the longest ocean voyage undertaken by a vessel of her class.

&quot;Balikpapan&quot; was paid off into reserve at Cairns on 18 September 1985; one of three landing craft decommissioned for economic reasons. She was recommissioned in 1990, although initially only for use as a training vessel attached to the Royal Australian Naval Reserve Darwin Division. The vessel was seconded to Operation Beachcomber on several occasions between 1991 and 1995 for hydrographic duties.

&quot;Balikpapan&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce. The landing craft was attached to INTERFET on two occasions; first from 20 September to 13 October 1999, then from 8 December 1999 to 15 January 2000. The ship was later awarded the battle honour &quot;East Timor 1999-2000&quot; in recognition of her service. From January to September 2000, the vessel was docked in Cairns for a life-of-type-extension refit. Post-refit, &quot;Balikpapan&quot; returned to East Timor to operate in support of UNTAET: November to December 2000, February to March 2001, May to June 2001, and July to August 2001.

&quot;Balikpapan&quot; returned to East Timor in 2006 during Operation Astute.

This vessel participated in Exercises Triton Thunder and Cassowary during May 2012. &quot;Balikpapan&quot; operated off Dundee Beach in the Northern Territory in concert with units from the Indonesian Navy and RAN Fleet Air Arm.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Balikpapan&quot; was decommissioned at Darwin on 12 December 2012.

The Philippine Navy has shown interest in acquiring the ship, after the Australian government donated two other sister ships, and in 2015. It was later confirmed that the Philippine Navy is acquiring three more LCH from Australia, including ex-HMAS &quot;Balikpapan&quot;, at a token price.

<doc id="435245" wikidata="Q3845772" url="?curid=435245" title="Marquess of Bath">
<text>[[Marquess#United Kingdom|Marquess]] of Bath is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1789 for Thomas Thynne, 3rd Viscount Weymouth. The Marquess holds the subsidiary titles [[Baron#Britain and Ireland|Baron]] Thynne, of Warminster in the County of Wiltshire, and [[Viscount#United Kingdom|Viscount]] Weymouth, both created in 1682 in the Peerage of England. He is also a baronet in the Baronetage of England.

==Family history until 1800==

The Thynne family descends from the soldier and courtier Sir John Thynne (died 1580), who constructed Longleat House between 1567 and 1579. In 1641 his great-grandson Henry Frederick Thynne was created a Baronet, of Caus Castle, in the Baronetage of England (some sources claim that the territorial designation is &quot;Kempsford in the County of Gloucester&quot;). He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He represented Oxford University and Tamworth in the House of Commons and also served as Envoy to Sweden. In 1682 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Thynne, of Warminster in the County of Wilts, and Viscount Weymouth, in the County of Dorset, with remainder to his younger brothers James Thynne (who died unmarried) and Henry Frederick Thynne and the heirs male of their bodies.

Lord Weymouth died without surviving male issue in 1714 (one of his three sons, the Honourable Henry Thynne, represented Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and Tamworth in Parliament but had died in 1708, leaving only daughters) and was succeeded in the peerages (according to the special remainders) by his great-nephew, the second Viscount. He was the grandson of the aforementioned Henry Frederick Thynne, brother of the first Viscount. He married as his second wife Lady Louisa Carteret, daughter of John, Earl Granville, a female-line grandson of John, 1st Earl of Bath of the second creation (a title which had become extinct in 1711). Lord Weymouth was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Viscount. He was a prominent statesman and served as Secretary of State for the Northern Department and as Secretary of State for the Southern Department. In 1789 the Bath title held by his ancestors was revived when he was created Marquess of Bath. Unusually, the Earldom of Bath was revived during the Marquess&#x27;s lifetime for Laura Pulteney, the heiress of the Earl of Bath of the fourth creation. Place names used by existing peerages are normally avoided when new ones are created. This earldom went extinct on her death in 1808.

===Family history 1800–present===
The 1st Marquess&#x27;s son Thomas, the 2nd Marquess, sat as Tory Member of Parliament for Weobley and Bath and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Somerset. His eldest son Thomas, represented Weobley in Parliament but predeceased his father by two months. Lord Bath was therefore succeeded by his second son Henry, the 3rd Marquess, who died three months later. He was a captain in the Royal Navy and also sat as Member of Parliament for Weobley. His son John, the 4th Marquess, succeeded at age six; he was Chairman of the Wiltshire County Council and Lord-Lieutenant of Wiltshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son Thomas, the 5th Marquess. He was a Conservative politician and served briefly as Under-Secretary of State for India in 1895. His second but eldest surviving son Henry, the 6th Marquess, represented Frome in the House of Commons as a Conservative. 

The 6th Marquess&#x27;s second son, Alexander, the 7th Marquess, succeeded in 1992. He was a well-known politician, author and artist. In 2015 the Times described him as &quot;a steaming pile of ancient kaftans and one of our wuffliest and weirdest mad-hatter aristocrats. He is best known for swanning around Longleat, his enormous Elizabethan pad in Wiltshire, entertaining his 75 concubines, or as he called them, &quot;wifelets&quot;.
The wifelets have included former Bond girls and Sri Lankan teenagers, as well as housewives and, according to some, prostitutes. The deal is simple: the wifelets get to hang out with Lord Bath in a jewel of a palace and in return he gets unlimited sex.&quot;

The titles are currently held by Ceawlin Thynn, the son of the 7th Marquess.

==Other family members==

The Honourable Henry Thynne, second son of the second Viscount, succeeded to the Carteret estates through his mother and assumed the surname of Carteret in lieu of Thynne. In 1784 he was created Baron Carteret with remainder to the younger sons of his brother the first Marquess of Bath (see the Baron Carteret for more information on this title). Several other members of the Thynne family have also gained distinction. The Reverend Lord John Thynne, third son of the second Marquess, was sub-Dean of Westminster Abbey; his seventh son was Major-General Sir Reginald Thomas Thynne (1843–1926). Lord Henry Thynne, second son of the third Marquess, was a Conservative politician and notably served as Treasurer of the Household from 1875 to 1880. Lord Alexander Thynne, third son of the fourth Marquess, represented Bath in the House of Commons from 1910 to 1918.

The family seat is Longleat House.

==Coat of arms==
The arms borne by the Thynne family are: &quot;Quarterly: 1st and 4th, barry of ten Or and Sable (Botteville); 2nd and 3rd, Argent, a lion rampant with tail nowed and erected Gules (Thynne)&quot;. This can be translated as: a shield divided into quarters, the top left and bottom right made of ten horizontal bars alternating gold and black (for the Boteville family); the top right and bottom left quarters white with a red lion rampant with a knotted tail (for the Thynne family).

<text>Malice Mizer (stylized as MALICE MIZER) was a Japanese visual kei rock band active from 1992 to 2001. The band was notable for their music and their live shows, featuring lavish historical costumes and stage sets, short silent theater pieces preluding various songs.

Formed by guitarists Mana and Közi, throughout their history, the band has gone through several different lineups and three drastic image changes, with Mana, Kozi, and bassist Yu~ki being the band&#x27;s sole consistent members. Their earlier music and themes were characterized by their strong French and classical influences, later moving away from deliberate French romanticism and incorporating Gothic aspects after several difficulties befell the band. 

At their peak with singer Gackt and drummer Kami, they were considered one of &quot;the big four of visual kei&quot; alongside La&#x27;cryma Christi, Fanatic Crisis and Shazna. Their third and most successful studio album &quot;Merveilles&quot; (1998) was included in 2021 by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; on a list of 13 essential Japanese rock and metal albums. However, their success was short-lived, and in late 2001 it was announced that Malice Mizer would go on an indefinite hiatus. Mana, Közi and Yu~ki have performed together several times since 2010.

==History==

===1992–1994: Tetsu era===

After leaving Matenrou, guitarists Mana and Közi formed Malice Mizer in August 1992 with Tetsu on vocals, Yu~ki on bass and Gaz on drums. The band&#x27;s name is a coined word for &quot;Malice and Misery &quot;, extracted from &quot;Nothing but a being of malice and tragedy.&quot; — their reply to the question &quot;What is a human being?&quot; From the outset, the band established their trademark &quot;twin guitar&quot;&#x27; sound, whereby two guitars play different melodies creating polyphony. Malice Mizer&#x27;s sound during the Tetsu era was a mixture of early 1980s gothic rock, progressive rock and strong classical influences. Their first official release was the song &quot;Speed of Desperate&quot; on the 1993 compilation &quot;Braintrash&quot;. Before this, they had released a demo tape called &quot;Sans Logique&quot; (a nod to French pop singer Mylène Farmer&#x27;s hit song &quot;Sans Logique&quot;) which contained no vocals. Shortly after the release of &quot;Braintrash&quot;, Gaz left the band to join Kneuklid Romance, while Kneuklid Romance&#x27;s drummer Kami in turn joined Malice Mizer. In 1994, after a couple more demos, the band released their debut album &quot;Memoire&quot; on Mana&#x27;s newly founded independent record label . It was re-released at the end of the year with an additional bonus track, &quot;Baroque&quot;, under the title &quot;Memoire DX&quot;. Only days later, singer and lyricist Tetsu left the band after his last gig on December 27, 1994. While the exact reasons are unknown, Tetsu went on to take a different direction in his work. The band&#x27;s continued use of his lyrics in songs they continued to perform with later vocalists suggest an amicable split.

===1995–1998: Gackt era===

After almost a year of inactivity, Mana recruited Gackt from a band Cains:Feel, as their new vocalist, with first performance in October 10 and released the single &quot;Uruwashiki Kamen no Shoutaijou&quot; on December 10, 1995. It was with this single that Malice Mizer started to actively differentiate themselves from other bands; when the song was performed live, Mana and Közi put down their guitars and instead performed a dance routine. With a new concept, partly due to Gackt&#x27;s influence (who was also interested in the theme of &quot;What is human?&quot; before joining the band), the band&#x27;s music became more art rock and synthpop, incorporating even stronger classical and electronic elements. Visually, the band also abandoned their 1980s goth look for colorful historical costumes with a gothic feel.

Malice Mizer released their second album, &quot;Voyage Sans Retour&quot;, in 1996, and their first home video in 1997; &quot;Sans Retour Voyage &quot;Derniere&quot; (Encore Une Fois)&quot;, a concert video recorded at Shibuya Public Hall featuring an elaborate stage and dance routines. The band became increasingly popular and signed with major record label Nippon Columbia that same year, where they released a number of successful singles (&quot;Bel Air&quot;, &quot;Au Revoir&quot;, &quot;Gekka no Yasōkyoku&quot;) and a short film, &quot;Bel Air (Kuuhaku no Toki no Naka de) de L&#x27;image&quot;. Their major label debut album, &quot;Merveilles&quot;, was released in March 1998. It was band&#x27;s commercially and critically most successful album, peaking at 2nd place on the Oricon Albums Chart and charting for 16 weeks, and both the album and its single &quot;Gekka no Yasōkyoku&quot; were certified Gold by the RIAJ for sales of over 200,000 copies. In May was released single &quot;Illuminati&quot; which peaked at 7th place and sold over 100,000 copies. The band had their own radio show around this time and played a two-day live at the Nippon Budokan, which involved a large building as a stage prop and elaborate theatrics; each member performing a skit with another member on their own (including [on &quot;Le Ciel&quot;] the aforementioned skit in which Gackt fell to the stage [to sing the song] and returned to &quot;Heaven&quot; by song&#x27;s end). It was a massive success and was released on video as &quot;Merveilles (Shuuen to kisuu) l&#x27;espace&quot;. In July 1998, the Yokohama Arena&#x27;s stage would be the last for Gackt, although in September 1998 was released their most successful single &quot;Le Ciel&quot; and participated in its promotion (peaked at 4th place on the Oricon Singles Chart, selling over 100,000 copies), because in January 1999, at the height of Malice Mizer&#x27;s success, he would suddenly leave the band and start a solo career.

There were various rumours about the cause of his departure. In October 1998 interview, Gackt complained about slow progression of the band. Later he recalled that by that time became main coordinator of band&#x27;s activities, and did not receive composing credits when deserved, but did not complain about it. In a February 1999 interview he claimed that his departure was primarily caused by his conflict with the management office, but also members&#x27; differences, the sudden income of money, and his isolation from the band led to this, and that at the last meeting with record company was told by the band members they cannot work with him anymore hence are splitting up. He was open minded to rejoin if the members invited him. On the other hand, band members in March 1999 interviews replied that after the last meeting they lost contact with him in November 1998, blamed his insistance on continuing band&#x27;s activity when they needed a break, noticeable lack of trusting relationship, that did not kick him out from the band, and that are looking for a new vocalist. A February 2001 report based on accounts of staff members who worked at the time with Malice Mizer, said that Gackt&#x27;s departure was caused by the president of Midi:Nette (at the time band&#x27;s management agency), Mana&#x27;s close partner. The mismanagement of band&#x27;s and fan club&#x27;s money left members to live in the same indie-days living conditions, and did not protect Gackt from paparazzi&#x27;s harassment. Other members restrained to speak up on anything, but when Gackt decided to confront the office, it resulted with his departure.

===1999–2000: Kami&#x27;s death===
Malice Mizer left Nippon Columbia shortly after and returned to Midi:Nette (established as Midi:Nette M.†.M). Kami died of a subarachnoid hemorrhage on June 21, 1999. He left behind a handful of songs, which the band eventually released as part of the EP/video boxset &quot;Shinwa&quot;, which consists of two songs composed by him and the short track &quot;Saikai&quot; written by the band. Kami was never officially replaced; from that point on, Malice Mizer would only use support drummers (namely ex-Aion member Shu, who is not shown in the band&#x27;s later promotional material, nor credited) and Kami would be credited as &quot;eternal blood relative&quot; on all their future releases. In the second half of 1999 and the beginning of 2000, Malice Mizer, still without an official vocalist, released a number of singles and began to work on a new album.

===2000–2001: Klaha era===
Eventually, they recruited Klaha (vocalist of dark wave band Pride of Mind), officially inducted into the band as a full member in August 2000. By then the band had abandoned the lighter pop music sound of the Gackt era for a dramatic mixture of classical music, dark wave, with slight heavy metal elements, and adopted an elaborate funerary elegant gothic look. In the summer of 2000, they released what would be their last album, &quot;Bara no Seidou&quot;, which peaked at 17th place on the charts, selling only 22,000 copies. On August 31 and September 1, they gave a theatrical two-day live at the Nippon Budokan, featuring pyrotechnics, a choir of veiled nuns and a scaled-down cathedral as a stage prop. In 2001, Malice Mizer starred in a feature-length vampire movie (&quot;Bara no Konrei (Mayonaka ni Kawashita Yakusoku)&quot;), and released three more singles: &quot;Gardenia&quot;, &quot;Beast of Blood&quot; and &quot;Garnet ~Kindan no Sono e~&quot;; &quot;Gardenia&quot; and &quot;Garnet&quot; being of a considerably lighter tone than their previous album, suggesting another new era for the band. However, the band members decided to go their own separate ways in 2001, leaving messages on their official website. The split was spoken of as a &quot;hiatus&quot;, so as not to exclude the possibility of a future reformation.

===Post projects===
After his departure in 1994, Tetsu released one solo album, and has subsequently taken part in a series of bands such as Zigzo, Mega 8 Ball, Nil; his most recent being The JuneJulyAugust. After his departure in early 1999, Gackt started a solo career a year later which has been enormously successful, becoming one of Japan&#x27;s top solo artists and TV personalities.

Klaha started a solo career as well in December 2002, but in the middle of 2004 it was announced that his fan club would be closing down, and after that there have been long periods of silence, only broken by rare updates on his site. In 2007 he stated on his site that he would resume musical activity that year. But this did not happen and no information has been announced since. Yu~ki has not been active on the music scene since 2004 when he wrote the song &quot;Memento&quot;, about Kami, for Közi&#x27;s solo project. In an informal conversation with Klaha, he said he would like to return to the music scene. Közi formed the industrial duo Eve of Destiny with Haruhiko Ash (ex:The Zolge) and also started a solo career. From 2008 to 2022, he was part of the band Dalle. Around June 2010, Közi started to perform with a band called My Horror Revue. He has also formed the band XA-VAT, who held their first performance on November 16, 2010 and released their first single on December 2. In 2012, he formed the band ZIZ with the musicians who supported him with his solo career.

Mana has formed his own solo project Moi dix Mois, which has performed live concerts across Europe. In addition to the successful solo project, Mana is a designer for his fashion label Moi-même-Moitié (started in 1999), which focuses on the styles Elegant Gothic Aristocrat and Elegant Gothic Lolita. He also continues to run his indie record label Midi:Nette, and has produced for artists such as Schwarz Stein and Kanon Wakeshima.

Malice Mizer&#x27;s song &quot;Gekka no Yasōkyoku&quot; was covered by D on the compilation &quot;Crush! -90&#x27;s V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-&quot;, which was released on January 26, 2011 and features modern visual kei bands covering songs from bands that were important to the &#x27;90s visual kei movement. Their song &quot;Illuminati&quot; was covered by Moran on its sequel, &quot;Crush! 2 -90&#x27;s V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-&quot;, that was released on November 23, 2011.

Original drummer Gaz died on December 22, 2017, due to illness.

===Deep Sanctuary reunions===

Since 2008, Mana&#x27;s band Moi dix Mois has held a special event, most taking place every two years, which has had some sort of connection to Malice Mizer. The first was Dis Inferno Vol.VI: Last Year Party on December 27, 2008, where Malice Mizer&#x27;s &quot;Speed of Desperate&quot; was played in a session by Mana on drums, Közi on guitar and Mana&#x27;s cousin on vocals. Közi said that this was the first time he and Mana had met since 2001. In 2009, Moi dix Mois and Közi went on a short two-date tour called Deep Sanctuary, on July 17 in Osaka and the 19th in Tokyo.

A year later in July 2010, Közi once again went on a tour with Moi dix Mois, titled Deep Sanctuary II. This tour had six shows, but the gig at Akasaka Blitz on the 17th was special, as Yu~ki was a special guest. This was the first time in 9 years that the three original members of Malice Mizer played together, and they were supported by Hayato (Moi dix Mois) on drums. They played &quot;Saikai no Chi to Bara&quot; and &quot;Beast of Blood&quot;, as well as a cover of Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;What Lurks on Channel X?&quot;. In 2012, the three played together twice more for Deep Sanctuary III; once on September 12 at Akasaka Blitz and again on November 14, 2012 at Osaka Muse Hall.

In 2014, another reunion of the three original members happened for Deep Sanctuary IV at Akasaka Blitz on October 11. This marked the first time they performed under the Malice Mizer name since 2001. It was followed by Deep Sanctuary V at Akasaka Blitz on August 7, 2016. On September 8 and 9, 2018, Mana, Közi, and Yu~ki reunited as Malice Mizer to perform two shows for the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary special at Tokyo Toyosu Pit. Titled Deep Sanctuary VI, Moi dix Mois and ZIZ also performed. They were supported on drums by Sakura, who was Kami&#x27;s drum mentor, and who used Kami&#x27;s original drum kit for the show. Mana tried reaching out to Tetsu, Gackt and Klaha regarding their participation, but the first two declined &quot;for various reasons, such as their current musical stances being different&quot;, and he was unable to reach the third. Instead, the band&#x27;s former roadies Shuji (Cali Gari), Kamijo, and Hitomi filled in as guest vocalists. A Blu-ray of the concert was released on June 21, 2019.

Deep Sanctuary VII was scheduled to take place at Mynavi Blitz Akasaka on June 7, 2020, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, and there has not been another Deep Sanctuary as of 2025

==Influences==
Mana stated that the opening theme music scared him a lot in childhood and Malice Mizer&#x27;s music has its roots in that experience.

<text>&quot;The Passionate Shepherd to His Love&quot; (1599), by Christopher Marlowe, is a pastoral poem from the English Renaissance (1485–1603). Marlowe composed the poem in iambic tetrameter (four feet of one unstressed syllable followed by one stressed syllable) in six stanzas, and each stanza is composed of two rhyming couplets; thus the first line of the poem reads: &quot;Come live with me and be my love&quot;.

==The poem==
&quot;The Passionate Shepherd to His Love&quot; (1599)

by Christopher Marlowe (1564–1593)

&lt;poem&gt;
Come live with me, and be my love;
And we will all the pleasures prove
That hills and valleys, dales and fields,
Woods, or steepy mountain yields.

And we will sit upon the rocks,
Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks
By shallow rivers to whose falls
Melodious birds sing madrigals.

And I will make thee beds of roses,
And a thousand fragrant posies;
A cap of flowers, and a kirtle
Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle;

A gown made of the finest wool
Which from our pretty lambs we pull;
Fair linèd slippers for the cold,
With buckles of the purest gold;

A belt of straw and ivy-buds,
With coral clasps and amber studs:
And, if these pleasures may thee move,
Come live with me, and be my love.

The shepherds&#x27; swains shall dance and sing
For thy delight each May-morning:
If these delights thy mind may move,
Then live with me, and be my love.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Effect and influence==
Walter Raleigh replied to Marlowe&#x27;s shepherd with the poem &quot;The Nymph&#x27;s Reply to the Shepherd&quot; (1600) with romantic realism countering romantic idealism; his Nymph reminds the shepherd that time will wither all the material gifts he offers, and his pastoral ideal will not last.

Subsequent responses to Marlowe have come from numerous other writers, including John Donne, Izaak Walton, Robert Herrick, C. Day Lewis, William Carlos Williams, Dorothy Parker, Ogden Nash, W. D. Snodgrass, Douglas Crase and Greg Delanty.

The poem inspired parodies, such as &quot;The Milkmaid&#x27;s Song,&quot; &quot;The Rinker&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;The Passionate Statistician to his Love.&quot; This last appeared in the satirical magazine Punch and poked fun at the politician, George Goschen who had described himself as &quot;a passionate statistician.&quot; The phrase was picked up by the biographer of Florence Nightingale, E. T. Cook, and applied to her. The sobriquet has stuck.

In about 1846 the composer William Sterndale Bennett set the words as a four-part madrigal.

In the 1939 film &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot;, both poems are sung as a duet by Mistress Margaret Radcliffe (Nanette Fabray), singing Marlowe&#x27;s original words, and Lady Penelope Gray (Olivia de Havilland) taking Raleigh&#x27;s rebuttal. The performance infuriates Queen Elizabeth (Bette Davis) whose doomed love for Robert Devereaux, 2nd Earl of Essex (Errol Flynn), 32 years her junior, is the subject of the story.

The line &quot;Come live with me and be my love&quot; was the inspiration for the 1941 film &quot;Come Live with Me&quot;, as well as the song &quot;Come Live with Me&quot; sung by Tony Scotti in the 1967 film &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;. It was also the third of the &quot;Liebeslieder Polkas for Mixed Chorus and Piano Five Hands&quot;, written by fictional composer P. D. Q. Bach (Peter Schickele) and performed by the Swarthmore College Chorus in 1980.

In &quot;Birthday Madrigals&quot; (1995) John Rutter sets both poems, giving Marlowe&#x27;s words to tenors and basses, with the women singing Raleigh&#x27;s reply, and the men singing over the women, changing the feel from question and reply to two people not listening each other.

The poem was adapted for the lyrics of the 1930s-style swing song performed by Stacey Kent at the celebratory ball in the 1995 film William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. Other songs to draw lyrics from the poem include The Prayer Chain song &quot;Antarctica&quot; (1996) from the album of the same name, and The Real Tuesday Weld song &quot;Let It Come Down&quot; from their album &quot;The Last Werewolf&quot; (2011). In 2015, the Royal Shakespeare Company used a version of the song in its production (set at the end of World War I) of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (under the name &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot;), played by the character Balthasar (Harry Waller), and sung by the whole cast.

<doc id="435252" wikidata="Q3506894" url="?curid=435252" title="Sylmar, Los Angeles">
<text>Sylmar is a suburban neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley and the northernmost neighborhood within the city of Los Angeles, California, United States. Historically known for its profusion of sylvan olive orchards, Sylmar can trace its past to the 18th century and the founding of the San Fernando Mission. In 1890, olive production was begun systematically. The Sylmar climate was also considered healthy, and so a sanitarium was established, the first in a series of hospitals in the neighborhood. There are fourteen public and eight private schools within Sylmar.

==History==
In 1874, the settlement was named Morningside. The foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains were transformed in the late 1890s by the Los Angeles Olive Growers Association. In 1893, the name changed to &quot;Sylmar&quot;, a fusion of two Latin words for &quot;forest&quot; and &quot;sea&quot; in reference to the large number of olive trees that covered the area. In 1894, up to were planted with olives trees, and by 1906, the property had become the largest olive grove in the world. During the picking season in the early 1900s, 300 Japanese were employed and housed in a village of tents. In 1927, the packing plant employed some five hundred workers during its busiest season.

The plan of the Olive Growers association in 1898 was to divide the area into 40-acre (16 ha) blocks bounded by &quot;broad drives,&quot; and within them 5-acre (2.0 ha) blocks would be laid out, &quot;each one of which is upon a street.&quot; About a hundred trees would be planted on each acre. Half of these lands were placed on the market in 1897-98 at $350 an acre (0.4 ha), with a minimum purchase of five acres. The terms were $350 in cash and $350 a year until paid for. The Olive Growers group would take care of the groves and, &quot;When the premises are turned over to the purchaser at the end of four years, it is an established, profit-yielding property, without incumbrance.&quot; There is no record as to the results of this plan.

In 1922 the Taft Realty Company of Hollywood purchased 300 acres (120 ha) from Ben F. Porter and divided them into tracts containing 1–15 acres (0.40–6.07 ha) each, which it planned to make into a townsite called Sylmar. Part of the acreage contained orange and lemon trees, and the rest had been used by the Ryan Wholesale and Produce Company for garden and truck farming. The land lay directly across the San Fernando Boulevard from the Sylmar olive grove and packing plant. A later advertisement stated the name of the subdivision as &quot;Sylmar Acres,&quot; with &quot;city lots&quot; selling for $450 to $550.

The property of the Sylmar Packing Corporation, with frontage of more than on Foothill Boulevard, was offered for sale in October 1938. At that time it was planted in olives, lemons, oranges and figs. A 40-acre (16 ha) section was to be set aside for a new townsite called Olive View and the rest subdivided into 5- and 10-acre (2- and 4-ha) farm lots, with many streets already paved and public utilities installed. In the same month, manufacturer and landowner John R. Stetson announced his 200-acre (81 ha) property adjoining the Sylmar ranch would also be divided and offered for sale.

===Postwar===
A May 1962 proposal by the city Planning Department for an increase in density was met with disapproval by residents at a community meeting. The city&#x27;s master plan for the area called for much of the agricultural land to be converted to suburban uses, plus zoning that would permit more apartments. There would also be expansion of industrial districts and more shopping centers. The plan proposed that the 4,500 acres then zoned for agriculture be reduced to 2,000, or 17% of the area. City officials said that Sylmar had been the slowest of all San Fernando Valley communities to develop its multiple dwelling areas, with permits issued for only 35 units in 1961 and 70 units in 1962.

Sylmar&#x27;s major growth came after the 1963 completion of the interchange between the Golden State Freeway and San Diego Freeway and the 1981 completion of the Foothill Freeway and 118 Freeway, which made the community easier to reach.
The 1971 San Fernando earthquake caused widespread injury and damage. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described two weeks later:
The community looks like a battlefield. Dozens of houses are twisted beyond repair. Families camp out in tents or trailers on front lawns, afraid to return even to those houses not condemned ... All homes have been without water for drinking, cooking and flushing toilets, although some service has been restored in the last few days. There is no gas, no heat. Telephones are still out. Housewives must travel out of the community to find grocery stores that are still open. On top of that, Sylmar feels that it has been forgotten ...

Four months after the 1971 earthquake, a methane gas explosion in a water tunnel being drilled beneath Sylmar killed 17 workers and is the worst tunneling disaster in California history. It resulted in the state adopting the toughest mining and tunnelling regulations in the United States. A memorial for the victims was erected in 2013. Cal/OSHA.

In 1971 city planners presented a land-use document that would preserve Sylmar&#x27;s image as one of &quot;houses, horses and orchards&quot; and would roll back the then-existing projection from 90,000 residents by 1990 to 53,500.

A proposal in 1980 to build an 80-unit low-income housing project near Sylmar High School at 13080-90 Dronfield Avenue was rejected by the Los Angeles City Housing Commission after eight thousand signatures were gathered against the plan and protesters filled a hearing in the high school auditorium.

In 1984 Sylmar was still largely rural, but there was an area of industrial development in its southeastern portion. In 1986, when its population was given 53,392, it still had some of the last large tracts of undeveloped land in the city, and the opening of the Foothill Freeway had placed it within a 45-minute drive of Downtown Los Angeles. Despite the population increase and a rise in the number of people living in condos and apartments, it was still one of the least-crowded areas of the city. Between 1980 and 1990 it was the fastest-growing area in the San Fernando Valley: Its population increased by 30.7% during those ten years in which the Valley itself grew by only 12.2%.

Reopening of the Olive View Medical Center in 1986 was seen as an impetus to population and business growth, as well as a threat to the horse-owning community. Practically every corner on Foothill Boulevard had been purchased for development. The population reached 53,392 in 1986.

Sylmar was impacted by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. It caused fires that burned over 70 homes. Sylmar was nicknamed &quot;The Top of Los Angeles,&quot; because it is the northernmost neighborhood in Los Angeles.

A study by four graduate students from the University of Southern California in 2005 stated that:
Sylmar in the 1970s and 1980s was a rural, predominantly white, non-Hispanic community, whose residents focused on creating a place centered around equestrian activities. Today, the dramatic influx of residents has serious consequences for a community that has too little housing stock, too few employment opportunities, overburdened public facilities and decaying public infrastructure.

By 2006 Sylmar&#x27;s open spaces were being rapidly subdivided. Resident Bart Reed noted that Sylmar was the last place in Los Angeles &quot;where a builder can find a single-family home on half an acre. They can tear them down and build 52 homes&quot; in their place. Longtime residents were concerned that the expansion would threaten their equestrian lifestyle in a community that still retained a largely rural atmosphere with corrals on large lots and horse trails that wound into the nearby San Gabriel Mountains.

The Sayre Fire in 2008 resulted in the loss of 489 residences in or near Sylmar, the &quot;worst loss of homes due to fire&quot; in Los Angeles&#x27;s history. In 2016 the Marek Fire destroyed 41 homes. 

In 2018, the northwest portion of the district was called &quot;Rancho Cascades&quot;.

On January 7, 2025, the Hurst Fire broke out near Sylmar.

===Crime===
====Drugs====
Tipped off by a Sylmar resident, dozens of investigators from at least five police departments and three federal agencies raided a warehouse at 12898 Bradley Street, on September 29, 1989, and seized some 21.4 tons of cocaine and $10 million in cash. It was the largest confiscation of the drug in history, estimated at $6.9 billion, enough for 1.38 billion doses. Three men were convicted on drug charges in 1990. Carlos Tapia Ponce, the warehouse manager, was given a life term, and in 2016 he died in prison at the age of 94. Other culprits were convicted later.

====Drag races and automobile cruising====
In 1993 it was reported that drag racing had been going on since the early 1970s, drawing hundreds of youths, and that the most popular &quot;speed strip&quot; was San Fernando Road near Balboa Boulevard. There had been four deaths within the previous two years. In one, a teenager speeding to the site rear-ended a car carrying a family of four, killing a mother and injuring her husband and two children. In 1997 Kenneth Acosta, 21, of Sylmar was charged with involuntary manslaughter after a drag race on the 118 Freeway resulted in an accident that caused the deaths of three people, all of them former members of the Sylmar High School band. He was granted probation and required to spend 250 hours talking to others about his crime.

In 1994, city officials declared one of the most popular cruising spots in the San Fernando Valley — La Rinda Plaza at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Workman Street — to be a public nuisance and ordered its owners to install overhead lighting, post security guards and install gates that could be closed at night. Illegal street racing or high-speed figure 8&#x27;s were frequently heard by residents near the Sylmar Public Library.

==Geography==
Sylmar gently slopes upward as a geological alluvial plain and alluvial fan from an elevation of slightly more than above sea level near San Fernando Road to slightly more than above sea level at the crest of Hubbard Street. The overall range of elevation in Sylmar is approximately . The slopes steepen into the San Gabriel Mountains on the north side of Sylmar resulting in steep residential streets with homes built on man-made terraces.

Sylmar touches the unincorporated Tujunga Canyons on the north, Lopez and Kagel canyons on the east, San Fernando on the southeast, Mission Hills on the south, and Granada Hills on the southwest and west.

===Climate===
The Valley shares the Los Angeles Basin&#x27;s dry, sunny weather, with only 17 inches (430 mm) annual precipitation on average. Snow in the San Fernando Valley is extremely rare, though the neighboring Angeles National Forest is capped with snow every winter.

Although Sylmar is only 20 miles (32 km) from the Pacific Ocean, the Valley can be considerably hotter than the Los Angeles Basin during the summer months and cooler during the winter months. The average high temperature in summer is 95 °F (35 °C), dropping down to 68 °F (20 °C). In winter, the average high is 66 °F (19 °C) and average low is 40 °F (4 °C).

==Demographics==
The population of the Sylmar area was roughly 3,500 in 1940, 10,000 in 1950, 31,000 in 1962, 40,000 in 1972, 41,922 in 1980 and 53,392 in 1986. By 2000, a &quot;wave of immigrants and working poor&quot; had enveloped Sylmar, Pacoima, Arleta and Sun Valley, resulting in a housing shortage for lower-income people. The 2000 U.S. census counted 69,499 residents in the 12.46-square-mile Sylmar neighborhood—or 5,579 people per square mile, among the lowest population densities for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 79,614. The City of Los Angeles Department of City Planning released that the 2021 population was 80,155. 

In 1980, Sylmar was predominantly white, the ethnic breakdown being 58% white and 36% Latino. Twenty years later, in 2000, the neighborhood was considered &quot;moderately diverse&quot; ethnically within Los Angeles, with a relatively high percentage of Latinos. The breakdown in 2000 was Latinos, 69.8%; whites, 20.7%; blacks, 4.1%; Asians, 3.4%, and others, 2.0%. Mexico (71.7%) and El Salvador (8.4%) were the most common places of birth for the 36.7% of the residents who were born abroad, an average figure for Los Angeles. Mexican (57.8%) and German (3.2%) were the most common ancestries. In 2000 the median age for residents was 28, considered young for city and county neighborhoods.

In 2000, renters occupied 29.2% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 70.8%. The average household size of 3.6 people was considered high for Los Angeles. The percentage of married women (55.5%) was among the county&#x27;s highest. There were 3,607 veterans, or 7.7% of the population, average for the city of Los Angeles and the county.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $65,783, considered average for the city.

==Arts and culture==
Sylmar is home to the Nethercutt Collection, a museum best known for its collection of classic automobiles. The Nethercutt museum also houses collections of mechanical musical instruments, including orchestrions, player pianos and music boxes, antique furniture, and a historical locomotive and train car.

===Historical landmarks===
* A channel, or spillway, called the Cascades marks the terminus of the Los Angeles Aqueduct system, which brings water from the Owens Valley to the Van Norman Reservoir in Granada Hills. The channel is a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 742 and California Historical Landmark No. 653. It is also on the list of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks.
* The San Fernando Pioneer Memorial Cemetery at 14400 Foothill Boulevard is the oldest nonsectarian cemetery in the San Fernando Valley, with the first burial recorded in 1892. It was listed as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1993. As San Fernando Cemetery, it is a California Historical Landmark.

The city also operates the Stetson Ranch Park., one of the city&#x27;s two equestrian parks.

Los Angeles County operates the El Cariso Community Regional Park, which was dedicated to the twelve fallen firefighters and survivors, members of the El Cariso Hotshots, an interagency hotshot crew in the Loop Fire in 1966. The park has a lighted ball diamond, a basketball court, tennis courts, children&#x27;s play areas, a community building, horseshoe pits, an indoor kitchen, picnic areas for large groups, picnic tables and shelters, and a swimming pool.

In addition the county operates the Veterans Memorial Park in an area adjacent to and outside of the Los Angeles City limits. The site of the park was the site of a veterans hospital that was built in the 1920s and closed in 1971 due to an earthquake that killed many veterans and employees at the hospital. The park, which was dedicated in 1979, has barbecue braziers, group camping areas, a community building, a disc golf course, picnic areas, a picnic pavilion, and toilets.

The Sylmar Hang Gliding Association operates their Sylmar Flight Park on Gridley Street near Simshaw Ave. Visitors can watch the activities most afternoons.

==Government==
===Local government===
In 1943 Sylmar volunteers, with cooperation from the city fire department, established their own branch station at 15097 Roxford Street, principally because Sylmar at that time was separated from other stations by railroad tracks.

<doc id="435261" wikidata="Q73026" url="?curid=435261" title="Legendre's constant">
<text>Legendre&#x27;s constant is a mathematical constant occurring in a formula constructed by Adrien-Marie Legendre to approximate the behavior of the prime-counting function formula_1. The value that corresponds precisely to its asymptotic behavior is now known to be 1.

Examination of available numerical data for known values of formula_1 led Legendre to an approximating formula.

Legendre proposed in 1808 the formula 
formula_3 (), as giving an approximation of formula_4 with a &quot;very satisfying precision&quot;.

Today, one defines the real constant formula_5 by
formula_6
which is solved by putting
formula_7
provided that this limit exists.

Not only is it now known that the limit exists, but also that its value is equal to 1, somewhat less than Legendre&#x27;s . Regardless of its exact value, the existence of the limit formula_5 implies the prime number theorem.

Pafnuty Chebyshev proved in 1849 that if the limit &quot;B&quot; exists, it must be equal to 1. An easier proof was given by Pintz in 1980.

It is an immediate consequence of the prime number theorem, under the precise form with an explicit estimate of the error term

formula_9

(for some positive constant &quot;a&quot;, where &quot;O&quot;(...) is the big O notation), as proved in 1899 by Charles de La Vallée Poussin, that &quot;B&quot; indeed is equal to 1. (The prime number theorem had been proved in 1896, independently by Jacques Hadamard and La Vallée Poussin, but without any estimate of the involved error term).

Being evaluated to such a simple number has made the term Legendre&#x27;s constant mostly only of historical value, with it often (technically incorrectly) being used to refer to Legendre&#x27;s first guess 1.08366... instead.

==Numerical values==
Using known values for formula_1, we can compute formula_11 for values of formula_12 far beyond what was available to Legendre:
Values up to formula_13 (the first two columns) are known exactly; the values in the third and fourth columns are estimated using the Riemann R function.

<text>HMAS &quot;Bandolier&quot; (P 95) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine ships were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors.The main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two &quot;.50&quot; calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the a&quot;ttack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Bandolier&quot; was built by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland, launched on 2 October 1968, and commissioned on 14 December 1968.

==Operational history==
&quot;Bandolier&quot; paid off on 16 November 1973. She was transferred to the Indonesian Navy and renamed KRI &quot;Sibarau&quot; (847). The patrol boat listed in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; was still operational in 2011. In December 2017, the vessel sank while on patrol in the North Sumatra Sea at 03.45.38 North and 098.57.55 East. The cause was not known, but there were no casualties among the crew.

<text>Human history or world history is the record of humankind from prehistory to the present. Modern humans evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago and initially lived as hunter-gatherers. They migrated out of Africa during the Last Ice Age and had spread across Earth&#x27;s continental land except Antarctica by the end of the Ice Age 12,000 years ago. Soon afterward, the Neolithic Revolution in West Asia brought the first systematic husbandry of plants and animals, and saw many humans transition from a nomadic life to a sedentary existence as farmers in permanent settlements. The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing.

These developments paved the way for the emergence of early civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, and China, marking the beginning of the ancient period in 3500 BCE. These civilizations supported the establishment of regional empires and acted as a fertile ground for the advent of transformative philosophical and religious ideas, initially Hinduism during the late Bronze Age, andduring the Axial Age: Buddhism, Confucianism, Greek philosophy, Jainism, Judaism, Taoism, and Zoroastrianism. The subsequent post-classical period, from about 500 to 1500 CE, witnessed the rise of Islam and the continued spread and consolidation of Christianity while civilization expanded to new parts of the world and trade between societies increased. These developments were accompanied by the rise and decline of major empires, such as the Byzantine Empire, the Islamic caliphates, the Mongol Empire, and various Chinese dynasties. This period&#x27;s invention of gunpowder and of the printing press greatly affected subsequent history.

During the early modern period, spanning from approximately 1500 to 1800 CE, European powers explored and colonized regions worldwide, intensifying cultural and economic exchange. This era saw substantial intellectual, cultural, and technological advances in Europe driven by the Renaissance, the Reformation in Germany giving rise to Protestantism, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment. By the 18th century, the accumulation of knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that brought about the Industrial Revolution, substantial to the Great Divergence, and began the modern period starting around 1800 CE. The rapid growth in productive power further increased international trade and colonization, linking the different civilizations in the process of globalization, and cemented European dominance throughout the 19th century. Over the last quarter-millennium, which included two devastating world wars, there has been a great acceleration in many spheres, including human population, agriculture, industry, commerce, scientific knowledge, technology, communications, military capabilities, and environmental degradation.

The study of human history relies on insights from academic disciplines including history, archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, and genetics. To provide an accessible overview, researchers divide human history by a variety of periodizations.

== Prehistory ==

=== Human origins ===

Humans evolved in Africa from great apes through the lineage of hominins, which arose 7–5 million years ago. The ability to walk on two legs emerged in early hominins after the split from chimpanzees, as an adaptation possibly associated with a shift from forest to savanna habitats. Hominins began to use rudimentary stone tools  million years ago, marking the advent of the Paleolithic era.

The genus &quot;Homo&quot; evolved from &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. The earliest record of &quot;Homo&quot; is the 2.8 million-year-old specimen LD 350-1 from Ethiopia, and the earliest named species is &quot;Homo habilis&quot; which evolved by 2.3 million years ago. The most important difference between &quot;Homo habilis&quot; and &quot;Australopithecus&quot; was a 50% increase in brain size. &quot;H. erectus&quot; evolved about 2 million years ago and was the first hominin species to leave Africa and disperse across Eurasia. Perhaps as early as 1.5 million years ago, but certainly by 250,000 years ago, hominins began to use fire for heat and cooking.

Beginning about 500,000 years ago, &quot;Homo&quot; diversified into many new species of archaic humans such as the Neanderthals in Europe, the Denisovans in Siberia, and the diminutive &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; in Indonesia. Human evolution was not a simple linear or branched progression but involved interbreeding between related species. Genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages was common in human evolution. DNA evidence suggests that several genes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non-sub-Saharan African populations. Neanderthals and other hominins, such as Denisovans, may have contributed up to 6% of their genome to present-day non-sub-Saharan African humans.

=== Early humans ===

&quot;Homo sapiens&quot; emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago from the species &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;. Humans continued to develop over the succeeding millennia, and by 100,000 years ago, were using jewelry and ocher to adorn the body. By 50,000 years ago, they buried their dead, used projectile weapons, and engaged in seafaring. One of the most important changes (the date of which is unknown) was the development of syntactic language, which dramatically improved the human ability to communicate. Signs of early artistic expression can be found in the form of cave paintings and sculptures made from ivory, stone, and bone, implying a form of spirituality generally interpreted as animism or shamanism. The earliest known musical instruments besides the human voice are bone flutes from the Swabian Jura in Germany, dated around 40,000 years old. Paleolithic humans lived as hunter-gatherers and were generally nomadic.

The migration of anatomically modern humans out of Africa took place in multiple waves beginning 194,000–177,000 years ago. The dominant view among scholars is that the early waves of migration died out and all modern non-Africans are descended from a single group that left Africa 70,000–50,000 years ago. &quot;H. sapiens&quot; proceeded to colonize all the continents and larger islands, arriving in Australia 65,000 years ago, Europe 45,000 years ago, and the Americas 21,000 years ago. These migrations occurred during the most recent Ice Age, when various temperate regions of today were inhospitable. Nevertheless, by the end of the Ice Age some 12,000 years ago, humans had colonized nearly all ice-free parts of the globe. Human expansion coincided with both the Quaternary extinction event and the Neanderthal extinction. These extinctions were probably caused by climate change, human activity, or a combination of the two.

=== Rise of agriculture ===
Beginning around 10,000 BCE, the Neolithic Revolution marked the development of agriculture, which fundamentally changed the human lifestyle. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa, in at least 11 separate centers of origin. Cereal crop cultivation and animal domestication had occurred in Mesopotamia by at least 8500 BCE in the form of wheat, barley, sheep, and goats. The Yangtze River Valley in China domesticated rice around 8000–7000 BCE; the Yellow River Valley may have cultivated millet by 7000 BCE. Pigs were the most important domesticated animal in early China. People in Africa&#x27;s Sahara cultivated sorghum and several other crops between 8000 and 5000 BCE, while other agricultural centers arose in the Ethiopian Highlands and the West African rainforests. In the Indus River Valley, crops were cultivated by 7000 BCE and cattle were domesticated by 6500 BCE. In the Americas, squash was cultivated by at least 8500 BCE in South America, and domesticated arrowroot appeared in Central America by 7800 BCE. Potatoes were first cultivated in the Andes of South America, where the llama was also domesticated. It is likely that women played a central role in plant domestication throughout these developments.

Various explanations of the causes of the Neolithic Revolution have been proposed. Some theories identify population growth as the main factor, leading people to seek out new food sources. Others see population growth not as the cause but as the effect of the associated improvements in food supply. Further suggested factors include climate change, resource scarcity, and ideology. The transition to agriculture created food surpluses that could support people not directly engaged in food production, permitting far denser populations and the creation of the first cities and states.

Cities were centers of trade, manufacturing, and political power. They developed mutually beneficial relationships with their surrounding countrysides, receiving agricultural products and providing manufactured goods and varying degrees of political control in return. Pastoral societies based on nomadic animal herding also developed, mostly in dry areas unsuited for plant cultivation such as the Eurasian Steppe or the African Sahel. Conflict between nomadic herders and sedentary agriculturalists was frequent and became a recurring theme in world history.

Metalworking was first used in the creation of copper tools and ornaments around 6400 BCE. Gold and silver soon followed, primarily for use in ornaments. The first signs of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, date to around 4500 BCE, but the alloy did not become widely used until the 3rd millennium BCE.

== Ancient history ==
=== Cradles of civilization ===


The Bronze Age saw the development of cities and civilizations. Early civilizations arose close to rivers, first in Mesopotamia (3300 BCE) with the Tigris and Euphrates, followed by the Egyptian civilization along the Nile River (3200 BCE), the Norte Chico civilization in coastal Peru (3100 BCE), the Indus Valley civilization in Pakistan and northwestern India (2500 BCE), and the Chinese civilization along the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers (2200 BCE).

These societies developed a number of shared characteristics, including a central government, a complex economy and social structure, and systems for keeping records. These cultures variously invented the wheel, mathematics, bronze-working, sailing boats, the potter&#x27;s wheel, woven cloth, construction of monumental buildings, and writing. Polytheistic religions developed, centered on temples where priests and priestesses performed sacrificial rites.

Writing facilitated the administration of cities, the expression of ideas, and the preservation of information. It may have independently developed in at least four ancient civilizations: Mesopotamia (3300 BCE), Egypt (around 3250 BCE), China (1200 BCE), and lowland Mesoamerica (by 650 BCE). The earliest system of writing was the Mesopotamian cuneiform script, which began as a system of pictographs, whose pictorial representations eventually became simplified and more abstract. Other influential early writing systems include Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Indus script. In China, writing was first used during the Shang dynasty (1766–1045 BCE).

Transport was facilitated by waterways, including rivers and seas, which fostered the projection of military power and the exchange of goods, ideas, and inventions. The Bronze Age also saw new land technologies, such as horse-based cavalry and chariots, that allowed armies to move faster. Trade became increasingly important as urban societies exchanged manufactured goods for raw materials from distant lands, creating vast commercial networks and the beginnings of archaic globalization. Bronze production in Southwest Asia, for example, required the import of tin from as far away as England.

The growth of cities was often followed by the establishment of states and empires. In Egypt, the initial division into Upper and Lower Egypt was followed by the unification of the whole valley around 3100 BCE. Around 2600 BCE, the Indus Valley civilization built major cities at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. Mesopotamian history was characterized by frequent wars between city-states, leading to shifts in hegemony from one city to another. In the 25th–21st centuries BCE, the empires of Akkad and the Neo-Sumerians arose in this area. In Crete, the Minoan civilization emerged by 2000 BCE and is regarded as the first civilization in Europe.

Over the following millennia, civilizations developed across the world. By 1600 BCE, Mycenaean Greece began to develop. It flourished until the Late Bronze Age collapse that affected many Mediterranean civilizations between 1300 and 1000 BCE. The foundations of many cultural aspects in India were laid in the Vedic period (1750–600 BCE), including the emergence of Hinduism. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the Mahajanapadas were established across the subcontinent.

Speakers of the Bantu languages began expanding across Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa as early as 3000 BCE until 1000 CE. Their expansion and encounters with other groups resulted in the displacement of the Pygmy peoples and the Khoisan, and in the spread of mixed farming and ironworking throughout sub-Saharan Africa, laying the foundations for later states.

The Lapita culture emerged in the Bismarck Archipelago near New Guinea around 1500 BCE and colonized many uninhabited islands of Remote Oceania, reaching as far as Samoa by 700 BCE.

In the Americas, the Norte Chico culture emerged in Peru around 3100 BCE. The Norte Chico built public monumental architecture at the city of Caral, dated 2627–1977 BCE. The later Chavín polity is sometimes described as the first Andean state, centered on the religious site at Chavín de Huantar. Other important Andean cultures include the Moche, whose ceramics depict many aspects of daily life, and the Nazca, who created animal-shaped designs in the desert called Nazca lines. The Olmecs of Mesoamerica developed by about 1200 BCE and are known for the colossal stone heads that they carved from basalt. They also devised the Mesoamerican calendar that was used by later cultures such as the Maya and Teotihuacan. Societies in North America were primarily egalitarian hunter-gatherers, supplementing their diet with the plants of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. They built earthworks such as Watson Brake (4000 BCE) and Poverty Point (3600 BCE), both in Louisiana.

=== Axial Age ===


From 800 to 200 BCE, the Axial Age saw the emergence of transformative philosophical and religious ideas that developed in many different places mostly independently of each other. Chinese Confucianism, Indian Buddhism and Jainism, and Jewish monotheism all arose during this period. Persian Zoroastrianism began earlier, perhaps around 1000 BCE, but was institutionalized by the Achaemenid Empire during the Axial Age. New philosophies took hold in Greece during the 5th century BCE, epitomized by thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle. The first Olympic Games were held in 776 BCE, marking a period known as &quot;classical antiquity&quot;. In 508 BCE, the world&#x27;s first democratic system of government was instituted in Athens.

Axial Age ideas shaped subsequent intellectual and religious history. Confucianism was one of the three schools of thought that came to dominate Chinese thinking, along with Taoism and Legalism. The Confucian tradition, which would become particularly influential, looked for political morality not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition. Confucianism would later spread to Korea and Japan. Buddhism reached China in about the 1st century CE and spread widely, with 30,000 Buddhist temples in northern China alone by the 7th century CE. Buddhism became the main religion in much of South, Southeast, and East Asia. The Greek philosophical tradition diffused throughout the Mediterranean world and as far as India, starting in the 4th century BCE after the conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon. Both Christianity and Islam developed from the beliefs of Judaism.

=== Regional empires ===
The millennium from 500 BCE to 500 CE saw a series of empires of unprecedented size develop. Well-trained professional armies, unifying ideologies, and advanced bureaucracies created the possibility for emperors to rule over large domains whose populations could attain numbers upwards of tens of millions of subjects. International trade also expanded, most notably the massive trade routes in the Mediterranean Sea, the maritime trade web in the Indian Ocean, and the Silk Road.

The kingdom of the Medes helped to destroy the Assyrian Empire in tandem with the nomadic Scythians and the Babylonians. Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, was sacked by the Medes in 612 BCE. The Median Empire gave way to successive Iranian states, including the Achaemenid (550–330 BCE), Parthian (247 BCE224  CE), and Sasanian Empires (224–651 CE).

Two major empires began in modern-day Greece. In the late 5th century BCE, several Greek city states checked the Achaemenid Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars. These wars were followed by the Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization, including the first theatrical performances. The wars led to the creation of the Delian League, founded in 477 BCE, and eventually the Athenian Empire (454–404 BCE), which was defeated by a Spartan-led coalition during the Peloponnesian War. Philip of Macedon unified the Greek city-states into the Hellenic League and his son Alexander the Great (356–323 BCE) founded an empire extending from present-day Greece to India. The empire divided into several successor states shortly after his death, resulting in the founding of many cities and the spread of Greek culture throughout conquered regions, a process referred to as Hellenization. The Hellenistic period lasted from the death of Alexander in 323 BCE until 31 BCE, when Ptolemaic Egypt fell to Rome.

In Europe, the Roman Republic was founded in the 6th century BCE and began expanding its territory in the 3rd century BCE. Prior to this, the Carthaginian Empire had dominated the Mediterranean, however lost three successive wars to the Romans. The Republic became an empire and by the time of Augustus (63 BCE14 CE), it had established dominion over most of the Mediterranean Sea. The empire continued to grow and reached its peak under Trajan (53–117 CE), controlling much of the land from England to Mesopotamia. The two centuries that followed are known as the &quot;Pax Romana&quot;, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and political stability in most of Europe. Christianity was legalized by Constantine I in 313 CE after three centuries of imperial persecution. It became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 CE while the emperor Theodosius outlawed pagan religions in 391–392 CE.

In South Asia, Chandragupta Maurya founded the Maurya Empire (320–185 BCE), which flourished under Ashoka the Great. From the 4th to 6th centuries CE, the Gupta Empire oversaw the period referred to as ancient India&#x27;s golden age. The resulting stability helped usher in a flourishing period for Hindu and Buddhist culture in the 4th and 5th centuries, as well as major advances in science and mathematics. In South India, three prominent Dravidian kingdoms emerged: the Cheras, Cholas, and Pandyas.

In China, Qin Shi Huang put an end to the chaotic Warring States period by uniting all of China under the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE). Qin Shi Huang was an adherent of the Legalist school of thought and he displaced the hereditary aristocracy by creating an efficient system of administration staffed by officials appointed according to merit. The harshness of the Qin dynasty led to rebellions and the dynasty&#x27;s fall. It was followed by the Han dynasty (202 BCE220 CE), which combined the Legalist bureaucratic system with Confucian ideals. The Han dynasty was comparable in power and influence to the Roman Empire that lay at the other end of the Silk Road. As economic prosperity fueled their military expansion, the Han conquered parts of Mongolia, Central Asia, Manchuria, Korea, and northern Vietnam. As with other empires during the classical period, Han China advanced significantly in the areas of government, education, science, and technology. The Han invented the compass, one of China&#x27;s Four Great Inventions.

In Africa, the Kingdom of Kush prospered through its interactions with both Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa. It ruled Egypt as the Twenty-fifth Dynasty from 712 to 650 BCE, then continued as an agricultural and trading state based in the city of Meroë until the fourth century CE. The Kingdom of Aksum, centered in present-day Ethiopia, established itself by the 1st century CE as a major trading empire, dominating its neighbors in South Arabia and Kush and controlling the Red Sea trade. It minted its own currency and carved enormous monolithic stelae to mark its emperors&#x27; graves.

Successful regional empires were also established in the Americas, arising from cultures established as early as 2500 BCE. In Mesoamerica, vast pre-Columbian societies were built, the most notable being the Zapotec civilization (700 BCE1521 CE), and the Maya civilization, which reached its highest state of development during the Mesoamerican classic period (), but continued throughout the post-classic period. The great Maya city-states slowly rose in number and prominence, and Maya culture spread throughout the Yucatán and surrounding areas. The Maya developed a writing system and used the concept of zero in their mathematics. West of the Maya area, in central Mexico, the city of Teotihuacan prospered due to its control of the obsidian trade. Its power peaked around 450 CE, when its 125,000–150,000 inhabitants made it one of the world&#x27;s largest cities.

Technology developed sporadically in the ancient world. There were periods of rapid technological progress, such as the Greco-Roman era in the Mediterranean region. Greek science, technology, and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period, typified by devices such as the Antikythera mechanism. There were also periods of technological decay, such as the Roman Empire&#x27;s decline and fall and the ensuing early medieval period. Two of the most important innovations were paper (China, 1st and 2nd centuries CE) and the stirrup (India, 2nd century BCE and Central Asia, 1st century CE), both of which diffused widely throughout the world. The Chinese learned to make silk and built massive engineering projects such as the Great Wall of China and the Grand Canal. The Romans were also accomplished builders, inventing concrete, perfecting the use of arches in construction, and creating aqueducts to transport water over long distances to urban centers.

Most ancient societies practiced slavery, which was particularly prevalent in Athens and Rome, where slaves made up a large proportion of the population and were foundational to the economy. Patriarchy was also common, with men controlling more political and economic power than women.

=== Declines, falls, and resurgence ===
The ancient empires faced common problems associated with maintaining huge armies and supporting a central bureaucracy. In Rome and Han China, the state began to decline, and barbarian pressure on the frontiers hastened internal dissolution. The Han dynasty fell into civil war in 220 CE, beginning the Three Kingdoms period, while its Roman counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the same time in what is known as the Crisis of the Third Century. From the Eurasian Steppe, horse-based nomads dominated a large part of the continent. The development of the stirrup and the use of horse archers made the nomads a constant threat to sedentary civilizations.

In the 4th century CE, the Roman Empire split into western and eastern regions, with usually separate emperors. The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 CE to German influence under Odoacer in the Migration Period of the Germanic peoples. The Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire, was more long-lasting. In China, dynasties rose and fell, but, in sharp contrast to the Mediterranean-European world, political unity was always eventually restored. After the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty and the demise of the Three Kingdoms, nomadic tribes from the north began to invade, causing many Chinese people to flee southward.

== Post-classical history ==


The post-classical period, dated roughly from 500 to 1500 CE, was characterized by the rise and spread of major religions while civilization expanded to new parts of the world and trade between societies intensified. From the 10th to 13th centuries, the Medieval Warm Period in the northern hemisphere aided agriculture and led to population growth in parts of Europe and Asia. It was followed by the Little Ice Age, which, along with the plagues of the 14th century, put downward pressure on the population of Eurasia. Major inventions of the period were gunpowder, guns, and printing, all of which originated in China.

The post-classical period encompasses the early Muslim conquests, the Islamic Golden Age, and the commencement and expansion of the Arab slave trade, followed by the Mongol invasions and the founding of the Ottoman Empire. South Asia had a series of middle kingdoms, followed by the establishment of Islamic empires in India.

In West Africa, the Mali and Songhai Empires rose. On the southeast coast of Africa, Arabic ports were established where gold, spices, and other commodities were traded. This allowed Africa to join the Southeast Asia trading system, bringing it contact with Asia; this resulted in the Swahili culture.

China experienced the relatively successive Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, and early Ming dynasties. Middle Eastern trade routes along the Indian Ocean, and the Silk Road through the Gobi Desert, provided limited economic and cultural contact between Asian and European civilizations. During the same period, civilizations in the Americas, such as the Mississippians, Aztecs, Maya, and Inca reached their zenith.

=== Greater Middle East ===


Before the advent of Islam in the 7th century, the Middle East was dominated by the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires, which frequently fought each other for control of several disputed regions. This was also a cultural battle, with Byzantine Christian culture competing against Persian Zoroastrian traditions. The birth of Islam created a new contender that quickly surpassed both of these empires.

Muhammad, the founder of Islam, initiated the early Muslim conquests in the 7th century. He established a new unified polity in Arabia that expanded rapidly under the Rashidun Caliphate and the Umayyad Caliphate, culminating in the establishment of Muslim rule on three continents (Asia, Africa, and Europe) by 750 CE. The subsequent Abbasid Caliphate oversaw the Islamic Golden Age, an era of learning, science, and invention during which philosophy, art, and literature flourished. Scholars preserved and synthesized knowledge and skills of ancient Greece and Persia the manufacture of paper from China and the decimal positional numbering system from India. At the same time, they made significant original contributions in various fields, such as Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s development of algebra and Avicenna&#x27;s comprehensive philosophical system. Islamic civilization expanded both by conquest and based on its merchant economy. Merchants brought goods and their Islamic faith to China, India, Southeast Asia, and Africa.

Arab domination of the Middle East ended in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the Seljuk Turks, migrating south from the Turkic homelands. The Seljuks were challenged by Europe during the Crusades, a series of religious wars aimed at rolling back Muslim territory and regaining control of the Holy Land. The Crusades were ultimately unsuccessful and served more to weaken the Byzantine Empire, especially with the sack of Constantinople in 1204. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the Mongols, swept through the region but were eventually eclipsed by the Turks and the founding of the Ottoman Empire in modern-day Turkey around 1299.

In the 7th century, North Africa saw the extinguishment of Byzantine Africa and the Berber kingdoms in the Early Muslim conquests. From the 10th century, the Abbasid Caliphate&#x27;s African territory was consumed by the Fatimid Caliphate centered on Egypt, who were supplanted by the Ayyubids in the 12th century, and them later by the Mamluks in the 13th century. In the Maghreb and Western Sahara, the Almoravids dominated from the 11th century, until it was subsumed by the Almohad Caliphate in the 12th century. The Almohads&#x27; collapse gave rise to the Marinids in Morocco, the Zayyanids in Algeria, and the Hafsids in Tunisia.

The Caucasus was fought over in a series of wars between the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires. However, the two opposing powers became exhausted due to continuous conflict. Hence, the Rashidun Caliphate was able to freely expand into the region during the early Muslim conquests. The Seljuk Turks later subjugated Armenia and Georgia in the 11th century. The Mongols subsequently invaded the Caucasus in the 13th century.

Steppe nomads from Central Asia continued to threaten sedentary societies in the post-classical era, but they also faced incursions from the Arabs and Chinese. China expanded into Central Asia during the Sui dynasty (581–618). The Chinese were confronted by Turkic nomads, who were becoming the most dominant ethnic group in the region. Originally the relationship was largely cooperative but in 630, the Tang dynasty began an offensive against the Turks by capturing areas of the Ordos Desert. In the 8th century, Islam began to penetrate the region and soon became the sole faith of most of the population, though Buddhism remained strong in the east. From the 9th to 13th centuries, Central Asia was divided among several powerful states, including the Samanid, Seljuk, and Khwarazmian Empires. These states were succeeded by the Mongols in the 13th century. In 1370, Timur, a Turkic leader in the Mongol military tradition, conquered most of the region and founded the Timurid Empire. Timur&#x27;s large empire collapsed soon after his death, but his descendants retained control of a core area in Central Asia and Iran. They oversaw the Timurid Renaissance of art and architecture.

=== Europe ===


Since at least the 4th century, Christianity has played a prominent role in shaping the culture, values, and institutions of Western civilization, primarily through Catholicism and later also Protestantism. Europe during the Early Middle Ages was characterized by depopulation, deurbanization, and barbarian invasions, all of which had begun in late antiquity. The barbarian invaders formed their own new kingdoms in the remains of the Western Roman Empire. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, most of the new kingdoms incorporated existing Roman institutions. Christianity expanded in Western Europe, and monasteries were founded. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the Franks under the Carolingian dynasty established an empire covering much of Western Europe; it lasted until the 9th century, when it succumbed to pressure from new invaders—the Vikings, Magyars, and Arabs. It split into West Francia and East Francia, which developed into middle ages France and the Holy Roman Empire, middle ages Germany. During the Carolingian era, churches developed a form of musical notation called neume which became the basis for the modern notation system. Kievan Rus&#x27; expanded from its capital in Kiev to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, Vladimir the Great adopted Orthodox Christianity as the state religion.

During the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and crop yields to increase. The establishment of the feudal system affected the structure of medieval society. It included manorialism, the organization of peasants into villages that owed rents and labor service to nobles, and vassalage, a political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rents from lands and manors. Kingdoms became more centralized after the decentralizing effects of the breakup of the Carolingian Empire. In 1054, the Great Schism between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches led to the prominent cultural differences between Western and Eastern Europe. The Crusades were a series of religious wars waged by Christians to wrest control of the Holy Land from the Muslims and succeeded for long enough to establish some Crusader states in the Levant. Italian merchants imported slaves to work in households or in sugar processing. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism and the founding of universities, while the building of Gothic cathedrals and churches was one of the outstanding artistic achievements of the age. The Middle Ages witnessed the first sustained urbanization of Northern and Western Europe and lasted until the beginning of the early modern period in the 16th century.

The Mongols reached Europe in 1236 and conquered Kievan Rus&#x27;, along with briefly invading Poland and Hungary. Lithuania cooperated with the Mongols but remained independent and in the late 14th century formed a personal union with Poland. The Late Middle Ages were marked by difficulties and calamities. Famine, plague, and war devastated the population of Western Europe. The Black Death alone killed approximately 75 to 200 million people between 1347 and 1350. It was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. Starting in Asia, the disease reached the Mediterranean and Western Europe during the late 1340s, and killed tens of millions of Europeans in six years; between a quarter and a third of the population perished.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
Sub-Saharan Africa was home to many different civilizations. In Nubia, the Kingdom of Kush was succeeded by the Christian kingdoms of Makuria, Alodia, and Nobatia. In the 7th century, Makuria conquered Nobatia to become the dominant power in the region and resisted Muslim expansion. They later entered a severe decline following civil war and Arab migrations to the Sudan and had disintegrated by the 15th century, giving rise to the Funj Sultanate.

In the Horn of Africa, Islam spread among the Somalis, while the Kingdom of Aksum declined from the 7th century following Muslim dominance over the Red Sea trade, and collapsed in the 10th century. The Zagwe dynasty emerged in the 12th century and contested hegemony with the Sultanate of Shewa and the powerful Kingdom of Damot. In the 13th century, the Zagwe were overthrown by the Solomonic dynasty of the Ethiopian Empire, while Shewa gave way to the Walashma dynasty of the Sultanate of Ifat. Ethiopia emerged victorious against Ifat and occupied the Muslim states. The Ajuran Sultanate rose on the Horn&#x27;s east coast to dominate the Indian Ocean trade. Ifat was succeeded by the Adal Sultanate who reconquered much of the Muslim lands.

In the Sahel region of West Africa, the Ghana Empire formed from between the 2nd and 8th centuries, while from the 7th century the Gao Empire ruled to its east. Almoravid capture of royal Aoudaghost led to Ghana’s conversion to Islam in the 11th century, and climatic changes led to Ghana&#x27;s conquest by its vassal Sosso in the 13th century. Sosso was quickly overthrown by the Mali Empire who conquered Gao and dominated the trans-Saharan trade. The Mossi Kingdoms were established to its south. To the east, the Kanem–Bornu Empire ruled from the 6th century, and projected power over the Hausa Kingdoms. The 15th century saw the crumbling of the Mali Empire, with the dominant power in the region becoming the Songhai Empire centered on Gao.

In the forest regions of West Africa, various kingdoms and empires flourished, such as the Yoruba empires of Ife and Oyo, the Igbo Kingdom of Nri, the Edo Kingdom of Benin (famous for its art), the Dagomba Kingdom of Dagbon, and the Akan kingdom of Bonoman. They came into contact with the Portuguese in the 15th century which saw the start of the Atlantic slave trade.

In the Congo Basin by the 13th century there were three main confederations of states: the Seven Kingdoms, Mpemba, and one led by Vungu. In the 14th century the Kingdom of Kongo emerged and dominated the region. Further east, the Luba Empire was founded in the Upemba Depression in the 15th century. In the northern Great Lakes, the Empire of Kitara rose around the 11th century, famed for its total lack of written record. It collapsed in the 15th century following Luo migrations to the region.

On the Swahili coast the Swahili city-states thrived off of the Indian Ocean trade and gradually Islamized, giving rise to the Kilwa Sultanate from the 10th century. Madagascar was settled by Austronesian peoples between the 5th and 7th centuries, as societies organized at the behest of &quot;hasina&quot;. In Southern Africa, early kingdoms included Mapela and Mapungubwe, followed by the Kingdom of Zimbabwe in the 13th century, and the Mutapa Empire in the 15th century.

=== South Asia ===

After the fall of the Gupta Empire in 550 CE, North India was divided into a complex and fluid network of smaller kingdoms. Early Muslim incursions began in the northwest in 711 CE, when the Arab Umayyad Caliphate conquered much of present-day Pakistan. The Arab military advance was largely halted at that point, but Islam still spread in India, largely due to the influence of Arab merchants along the western coast. The 9th century saw the Tripartite Struggle for control of North India between the Pratihara, Pala, and Rashtrakuta Empires.

Post-classical dynasties in South India included those of the Chalukyas, Hoysalas, and Cholas. Literature, architecture, sculpture, and painting flourished under the patronage of these kings. Some of the other important states that emerged in South India during this time included the Bahmani Sultanate and the Vijayanagara Empire.

=== Northeast Asia ===
After a period of relative disunity, China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 589. Under the succeeding Tang dynasty (618–907), China entered a golden age during which political stability and economic prosperity were accompanied by literary and artistic accomplishment, like the poetry of Li Bai and Du Fu. The Sui and Tang instituted the long-lasting imperial examination system, under which administrative positions were open only to those who passed an arduous test on Confucian thought and the Chinese classics. China competed with Tibet (618–842) for control of areas in Inner Asia. However, the Tang dynasty eventually splintered. After half a century of turmoil, the Song dynasty reunified much of China. Pressure from nomadic empires to the north became increasingly urgent. By 1127, northern China had been lost to the Jurchens in the Jin–Song Wars, and the Mongols conquered all of China in 1279. After about a century of Mongol Yuan dynasty rule, the ethnic Chinese reasserted control with the founding of the Ming dynasty in 1368.

In Japan, the imperial lineage was established during the 3rd century CE, and a centralized state developed during the Yamato period (c. 300–710). Buddhism was introduced, and there was an emphasis on the adoption of elements of Chinese culture and Confucianism. The Nara period (710–794) was characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture, as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture. The Heian period (794–1185) saw the peak of imperial power, followed by the rise of militarized clans and the samurai. It was during the Heian period that Murasaki Shikibu penned &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, sometimes considered the world&#x27;s first novel. From 1185 to 1868, Japan was dominated by powerful regional lords (daimyos) and the military rule of warlords (shoguns) such as the Ashikaga and Tokugawa shogunates. The emperor remained but did not wield significant influence. Meanwhile, the power of merchants grew. An influential art style known as &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; arose during the Tokugawa years, consisting of woodblock prints which originally depicted famous courtesans.

Post-classical Korea saw the end of the Three Kingdoms era, in which the kingdoms of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla had competed for hegemony. This period ended when Silla conquered Baekje in 660 and Goguryeo in 668, marking the beginning of the Northern and Southern States period, with Unified Silla in the south and Balhae, a successor state to Goguryeo, in the north. In 892 CE, this arrangement reverted to the Later Three Kingdoms, with Goguryeo emerging as dominant, unifying the entire peninsula by 936. The founding Goryeo dynasty ruled until 1392, succeeded by the Joseon dynasty, which ruled for approximately 500 years.

In Mongolia, Genghis Khan united various Mongol and Turkic tribes under one banner in 1206. The Mongol Empire expanded to comprise all of China and Central Asia, as well as large parts of Russia and the Middle East, to become the largest contiguous empire in history. After Möngke Khan died in 1259, the Mongol Empire was divided into four successor states: the Yuan Dynasty in China, the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, the Golden Horde in Eastern Europe and Russia, and the Ilkhanate in Iran.

=== Southeast Asia ===


The Southeast Asian polity of Funan, which had originated in the 2nd century CE, went into decline in the 6th century as Chinese trade routes shifted away from its ports. It was replaced by the Khmer Empire in 802 CE. The capital city of the Khmers at Angkor was the most extensive city in the world before the industrial age and contained Angkor Wat, the world&#x27;s largest religious monument. The Sukhothai (mid-13th century) and Ayutthaya Kingdoms (1351) were major powers of the Thais, who were influenced by the Khmers.

Starting in the 9th century, the Pagan Kingdom rose to prominence in modern Myanmar. Its collapse brought about political fragmentation that ended with the rise of the Toungoo Empire in the 16th century. Other notable kingdoms of the period include Srivijaya and Lavo (both coming into prominence in the 7th century), Champa and Hariphunchai (both about 750), Đại Việt (968), Lan Na (13th century), Majapahit (1293), Lan Xang (1353), and Ava (1365). Hinduism and Buddhism had been spreading in Southeast Asia since the 1st century CE when, beginning in the 13th century, Islam arrived and made its way to regions such as present-day Indonesia. This period also saw the emergence of the Malay states, including Brunei and Malacca. In the Philippines, several polities were formed such as Tondo, Cebu, and Butuan.

=== Oceania ===


The Polynesians, descendants of the Lapita peoples, colonized vast reaches of Remote Oceania beginning around 1000 CE. Their voyages resulted in the colonization of hundreds of islands including the Marquesas, Hawaii, Rapa Nui (Easter Island), and New Zealand.

The Tui Tonga Empire was founded in the 10th century CE and expanded between 1250 and 1500. Tongan culture, language, and hegemony spread widely throughout eastern Melanesia, Micronesia, and central Polynesia during this period. They influenced east &#x27;Uvea, Rotuma, Futuna, Samoa, and Niue, as well as specific islands and parts of Micronesia, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia. In Northern Australia, there is evidence that Aboriginal Australians regularly traded with Makassan trepangers from Indonesia before the arrival of Europeans. In Aboriginal societies, leadership was based on achievement while the social structure of Polynesian societies was characterized by hereditary chiefdoms.

=== Americas ===

In North America, this period saw the rise of the Mississippian culture in the modern-day United States  CE, marked by the extensive 11th-century urban complex at Cahokia. The Ancestral Puebloans and their predecessors (9th–13th centuries) built extensive permanent settlements, including stone structures that remained the largest buildings in North America until the 19th century.

In Mesoamerica, the Teotihuacan civilization fell and the classic Maya collapse occurred. The Aztec Empire came to dominate much of Mesoamerica in the 14th and 15th centuries.

In South America, the 15th century saw the rise of the Inca. The Inca Empire, with its capital at Cusco, spanned the entire Andes, making it the most extensive pre-Columbian civilization. The Inca were prosperous and advanced, known for an excellent road system and elegant stonework.

== Early modern period ==
The early modern period is the era following the European Middle Ages until 1789 or 1800. A common break with the medieval period is placed between 1450 and 1500 which includes a number of significant events: the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire, the spread of printing and European voyages of discovery to America and along the African coast. The nature of warfare evolved as the size and organization of military forces on land and sea increased, alongside the wider propagation of gunpowder. The early modern period is significant for the start of proto-globalization, increaslingly centralized bureaucratic states and early forms of capitalism. European powers also began colonizing large parts of the world through maritime empires: first the Portuguese and Spanish Empires, then the French, English, and Dutch Empires. Historians still debate the causes of Europe&#x27;s rise, which is known as the Great Divergence.

Capitalist economies emerged, initially in the northern Italian republics and some Asian port cities. European states practiced mercantilism by implementing one-sided trade policies designed to benefit the mother country at the expense of its colonies. Starting at the end of the 15th century, the Portuguese established trading posts across Africa, Asia, and Brazil, for commodities like gold and spices while also practicing slavery. In the 17th century, private chartered companies were established, such as the English East India Company in 1600often described as the first multinational corporationand the Dutch East India Company in 1602. Meanwhile, in much of the European sphere, serfdom declined and eventually disappeared while the power of the Catholic Church waned.

The Age of Discovery was the first period in which the Old World engaged in substantial cultural, material, and biological exchange with the New World. It began in the late 15th century, when Portugal and Castile sent the first exploratory voyages to the Americas, where Christopher Columbus first arrived in 1492. Global integration continued as European colonization of the Americas initiated the Columbian exchange: the exchange of plants, animals, foods, human populations (including slaves), communicable diseases, and culture between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. It was one of history&#x27;s most important global events, involving ecology and agriculture. New crops brought from the Americas by 16th-century European seafarers substantially contributed to world population growth.

=== Greater Middle East ===
The Ottoman Empire quickly came to dominate the Middle East after conquering Constantinople in 1453, which marked the end of the Byzantine Empire. Persia came under the rule of the Safavids in 1501, succeeded by the Afshars in 1736, the Zands in 1751, and the Qajars in 1794. The Safavids established Shia Islam as Persia&#x27;s official religion, thus giving Persia a separate identity from its Sunni neighbors. Along with the Mughals in India, the Ottomans and Safavids are known as the gunpowder empires because of their early adoption of firearms. Throughout the 16th century the Ottomans conquered all of North Africa save for Morocco, which came under the rule of the Saadi dynasty at the same time, and then the Alawi dynasty in the 17th century. At the end of the 18th century, the Russian Empire began its conquest of the Caucasus. The Uzbeks replaced the Timurids as the preeminent power in Central Asia.

=== Europe ===

The early modern period in Europe was an era of intense intellectual ferment. The Renaissancethe &quot;rebirth&quot; of classical culture, beginning in Italy in the 14th century and extending into the 16thcomprised the rediscovery of the classical world&#x27;s cultural, scientific, and technological achievements, and the economic and social rise of Europe. This period is also celebrated for its artistic and literary attainments. Petrarch&#x27;s poetry, Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;, and the paintings and sculptures of Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer, as part of the Northern Renaissance, are some of the great works of the age. After the Renaissance came the Reformation, an anti-clerical theological and social movement started in Germany by Martin Luther that resulted in the creation of Protestant Christianity.

The Renaissance also engendered a culture of inquisitiveness which ultimately led to humanism and the Scientific Revolution, an effort to understand the natural world through direct observation and experiment. The success of the new scientific techniques inspired attempts to apply them to political and social affairs, known as the Enlightenment, by thinkers such as John Locke and Immanuel Kant. This development was accompanied by secularization as a continued decline of the influence of religious beliefs and authorities in the public and private spheres. Johannes Gutenberg&#x27;s invention of movable type printing in 1440 helped spread the ideas of the new intellectual movements.

In addition to changes wrought by incipient capitalism and colonialism, early modern Europeans experienced an increase in the power of the state. Absolute monarchs in France, Russia, the Habsburg lands, and Prussia produced powerful centralized states, with strong armies and efficient bureaucracies, all under the control of the king. In Russia, Ivan the Terrible was crowned in 1547 as the first tsar of Russia, and by annexing the Turkic khanates in the east, transformed Russia into a regional power, eventually replacing the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as a major power in Eastern Europe. The countries of Western Europe, while expanding prodigiously through technological advances and colonial conquest, competed with each other economically and militarily in a state of almost constant war. Wars of particular note included the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the War of the Spanish Succession, the Seven Years&#x27; War, and the French Revolutionary Wars. The French Revolution, starting in 1789, laid the groundwork of liberal democracy by overthrowing monarchy. It led to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
In the Horn of Africa, there was the Oromo expansion in the 16th century, which weakened Ethiopia and caused Adal&#x27;s collapse. Ajuran was succeeded by the Geledi Sultanate. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Ethiopia rapidly expanded.

In West Africa, the Songhai Empire fell to Moroccan invasion in the late 16th century. They were succeeded by the Bamana Empire. The Fula jihads beginning in the 18th century led to the establishment of the Sokoto Caliphate, the Massina Empire, and the Tukulor Empire. In the forest regions, the Asante Empire was established in present-day Ghana. Between 1515 and 1800, 8 million Africans were exported in the Atlantic slave trade.

In the Congo Basin, Kongo fought three wars against the Portuguese who had begun colonizing Angola, ending in the conquest of Ndongo in the 17th century. Further east, the Lunda Empire rose to dominate the region. It fell to the Chokwe in the 19th century. In the northern Great Lakes, there were the kingdoms of Bunyoro-Kitara, Buganda, and Rwanda among others.

Kilwa was conquered by the Portuguese in the 16th century as they began colonizing Mozambique. They were defeated by the Omani Empire who took control of the Swahili coast. In Madagascar the 16th century onward saw the emergence of Imerina, the Betsileo kingdoms, and the Sakalava empire; Imerina conquered most of the island in the 19th century. In the Zambezi Basin Mutapa was followed by the Rozvi Empire, with Maravi around Lake Malawi to its north. Mthwakazi succeeded Rozvi. Further south, the Dutch began colonizing South Africa in the 16th century, who lost it to the British. In the 19th century Dutch settlers formed various Boer Republics, while the Mfecane ravaged the region and led to the establishment of various African kingdoms.

=== South Asia ===
In the Indian subcontinent, the Mughal Empire was established under Babur in 1526 and lasted for two centuries. Starting in the northwest, it brought the entire subcontinent under Muslim rule by the late 17th century, except for the southernmost Indian provinces, which remained independent. To resist the Muslim rulers, the Hindu Maratha Empire was founded by Shivaji on the western coast in 1674. The Marathas gradually gained territory from the Mughals over several decades, particularly in the Mughal–Maratha Wars (1680–1707).

Sikhism developed at the end of the 15th century from the spiritual teachings of ten gurus. In 1799, Ranjit Singh established the Sikh Empire in the Punjab.

=== Northeast Asia ===
In 1644, the Ming were supplanted by the Qing, the last Chinese imperial dynasty, which ruled until 1912. Japan experienced its Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1600), followed by the Edo period (1600–1868). The Korean Joseon dynasty (1392–1910) ruled throughout this period, repelling invasions from Japan and China in the 16th and 17th centuries. Expanded maritime trade with Europe significantly affected China and Japan during this period, particularly through the Portuguese in Macau and the Dutch in Nagasaki. However, China and Japan later pursued isolationist policies designed to eliminate foreign influences.

=== Southeast Asia ===
In 1511, the Portuguese overthrew the Malacca Sultanate in present-day Malaysia and Indonesian Sumatra. The Portuguese held this important trading territory (and the valuable associated navigational strait) until overthrown by the Dutch in 1641. The Johor Sultanate, centered on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, became the dominant trading power in the region.

European colonization expanded with the Dutch in Indonesia, the Portuguese in Timor, and the Spanish in the Philippines.

=== Oceania ===
The Pacific Islands of Oceania were also affected by European contact, starting with the circumnavigational voyage of Ferdinand Magellan (1519–1522), who landed in the Marianas and other islands. Abel Tasman (1642–1644) sailed to present-day Australia, New Zealand, and nearby islands. James Cook (1768–1779) made the first recorded European contact with Hawaii. In 1788, Britain founded its first Australian colony.

=== Americas ===
Several European powers colonized the Americas, largely displacing the native populations and conquering the advanced civilizations of the Aztecs and Inca. Diseases introduced by Europeans devastated American societies, killing 60–90 million people by 1600 and reducing the population by 90–95%. In some cases, colonial policies included the deliberate genocide of indigenous peoples. Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France all made extensive territorial claims, and undertook large-scale settlement, including the importation of large numbers of African slaves. One side-effect of the slave trade was cultural exchange through which various African traditions found their way to the Americas, including cuisine, music, and dance. Portugal claimed Brazil, while Spain seized the rest of South America, Mesoamerica, and southern North America. The Spanish mined and exported prodigious amounts of gold and silver, leading to a surge in inflation known as the Price Revolution in the 16th and 17th centuries in Western Europe.

In North America, Britain colonized the east coast while France settled the central region. Russia made incursions into the northwest coast of North America, with its first colony in present-day Alaska in 1784, and the outpost of Fort Ross in present-day California in 1812. France lost its North American territory to England and Spain after the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). Britain&#x27;s Thirteen Colonies declared independence as the United States in 1776, ratified by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, ending the American Revolutionary War. In 1791, African slaves launched a successful rebellion in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. France won back its continental claims from Spain in 1800, but sold them to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.

== Modern era ==
=== Long nineteenth century ===

The long nineteenth century traditionally starts with the French Revolution in 1789, and lasts until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. It saw the global spread of the Industrial Revolution, the greatest transformation of the world economy since the Neolithic Revolution. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain around 1770 and used new modes of production—the factory, mass production, and mechanization—to manufacture a wide array of goods faster while using less labor than previously required.

Industrialization raised the global standard of living but caused upheaval as factory owners and workers clashed over wages and working conditions. Along with industrialization came modern globalization, the increasing interconnection of world regions in the economic, political, and cultural spheres. Globalization began in the early 19th century and was enabled by improved transportation technologies such as railroads and steamships.

European empires lost territories in Latin America, which won independence by the 1820s through military campaigns, but expanded elsewhere as their industrial economies gave them an advantage over the rest of the world. Britain gained control of the Indian subcontinent, Burma, Malaya, North Borneo, Hong Kong, and Aden; the French took Indochina; and the Dutch cemented their rule over Indonesia. The British also colonized Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa with large numbers of British colonists emigrating to these colonies.

Russia colonized large pre-agricultural areas of Siberia. The United States completed its westward expansion, establishing control over the territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast.

In the late 19th century to early 20th century, the European powers, driven by the Second Industrial Revolution, rapidly conquered and colonized almost the entirety of Africa. Only Ethiopia and Liberia remained independent. Imperial rule in Africa involved many atrocities such as those in the Congo Free State and the Herero and Nama genocide.

Within Europe, economic and military competition fostered the creation and consolidation of nation-states, and other ethno-cultural communities began to identify themselves as distinctive nations with aspirations for their own cultural and political autonomy. This nationalism became important to peoples across the world in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the first wave of democratization, between 1828 and 1926, democratic institutions were established in 33 countries worldwide.

Most of the world abolished slavery and serfdom in the 19th century. Over several decades, beginning in the late 19th century and continuing throughout the 20th, in many countries the women&#x27;s suffrage movement won women the right to vote, and women began to enjoy greater access to education and to professions beyond domestic employment.

In response to encroachment by European powers, several countries undertook programs of industrialization and political reform along Western lines. The Meiji Restoration in Japan led to the establishment of a colonial empire, while the &quot;tanzimat&quot; reforms in the Ottoman Empire did little to slow the Ottoman decline. China achieved some success with its Self-Strengthening Movement but was devastated by the Taiping Rebellion, history&#x27;s bloodiest civil war, which between 1850 and 1864 killed 20–30 million people.

By the end of the century, the United States became the world&#x27;s largest economy. During the Second Industrial Revolution, new technological advances, involving electric power, the internal combustion engine, and assembly-line manufacturing, further increased productivity. Technological innovations also provided new avenues for artistic expression through the media of photography, sound recording, and film.

Meanwhile, industrial pollution and environmental degradation accelerated drastically. Balloon flight had been invented in the late 18th century, but it was only at the beginning of the 20th century that powered aircraft were developed.

The 20th century opened with Europe at an apex of wealth and power. Much of the world was under its direct colonial control or its indirect influence through heavily Europeanized nations like the United States and Japan. As the century unfolded, however, the global system dominated by rival powers experienced severe strains and ultimately yielded to a more fluid structure of independent nation states.

=== World wars ===
This transformation was catalyzed by wars of unparalleled scope and devastation. World War I was a global conflict from 1914 to 1918 between the Allies, led by France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and the Central Powers, led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. It had an estimated death toll ranging from 10 to 22.5 million and resulted in the collapse of four empiresthe Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian Empires. Its new emphasis on industrial technology had made traditional military tactics obsolete.

The Armenian, Assyrian, and Greek genocides saw the systematic destruction, mass murder, and expulsion of those populations in the Ottoman Empire. From 1918 to 1920, the Spanish flu caused the deaths of at least 25 million people.

In the war&#x27;s aftermath a League of Nations was formed in the hope of averting future international conflicts; and powerful ideologies rose to prominence. The Russian Revolution of 1917 created the first communist state, while the 1920s and 1930s saw fascist political parties gain control in Italy and Germany. The Soviet Union, during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule from 1924 to 1953, committed countless atrocities against its own people, including mass purges, forced labor camps, and widespread famine caused by state policies.

Ongoing national rivalries, exacerbated by the economic turmoil of the Great Depression, helped precipitate World War II. In that war, the vast majority of the world&#x27;s countries, including all the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. The leading Axis powers were Germany, Japan, and Italy; while the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China were the &quot;Big Four&quot; Allied powers.

The militaristic governments of Germany and Japan pursued an ultimately doomed course of imperialist expansionism. In the course of doing so, Germany orchestrated the genocide of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, and of millions of non-Jews across German-occupied Europe, while Japan murdered millions of Chinese. The war also saw the introduction and use of nuclear weapons, which brought unprecedented destruction and ultimately led to Japan&#x27;s surrender. Estimates of the war&#x27;s total casualties range from 55 to 80 million.

=== Contemporary history ===
When World War II ended in 1945, the United Nations was founded in the hope of preventing future wars, as the League of Nations had been formed following World War I. The United Nations championed the human rights movement, in 1948 adopting a Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Several European countries formed what would evolve into a 27-member-state economic and political community, the European Union.

World War II had opened the way for the advance of communism into Eastern and Central Europe, China, North Korea, North Vietnam, and Cuba. To contain this advance, the United States established a global network of alliances. The largest, NATO, was established in 1949 and eventually grew to include 32 member states. In response, in 1955 the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies formed the Warsaw Pact mutual-defense treaty.

The United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the primary global powers in the aftermath of World War II. Both nations harbored deep suspicions and fears about the global spread of the other&#x27;s political-economic system — capitalism for the United States and communism for the Soviet Union. This mutual distrust sparked the Cold War, a 45-year stand-off and arms race between the two nations and their allies.

With the development of nuclear weapons during World War II and their subsequent proliferation, all of humanity was put at risk of nuclear war between the two superpowers, as demonstrated by many incidents, most prominently the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Such war being viewed as impractical, the superpowers instead waged proxy wars in non-nuclear-armed Third World countries. The Cold War ended peacefully in 1991 after the Soviet Union collapsed, partly due to its inability to compete economically with the United States and Western Europe.

Cold War preparations to deter or fight a third world war accelerated advances in technologies that, though conceptualized before World War II, had been implemented for that war&#x27;s exigencies, such as jet aircraft, rocketry, and computers. In the decades after World War II, these advances led to jet travel; artificial satellites with innumerable applications, including GPS; and the Internet, which in the 1990s began to gain traction as a form of communication. These inventions revolutionized the movement of people, ideas, and information.

The second half of the 20th century also saw groundbreaking scientific and technological developments such as the discovery of the structure of DNA and DNA sequencing, the worldwide eradication of smallpox, the Green Revolution in agriculture, the discovery of plate tectonics, the moon landings, crewed and uncrewed exploration of space, advances in energy technologies, and foundational discoveries in physics phenomena ranging from the smallest entities (particle physics) to the greatest (physical cosmology).

These technical innovations had far-reaching effects. During the 20th century the world&#x27;s population quadrupled to six billion, while world economic output increased by a factor of 20. Toward the end of the 20th century, the rate of population growth started to decline, in part because of increased awareness of family planning and better access to contraceptives. Parts of the world now have sub-replacement fertility rates.

Public health measures and advances in medical science contributed to a sharp increase in global life expectancy at birth from about 31 years in 1900 to over 66 years in 2000. In 1820, 75% of humanity lived on less than one dollar a day, while in 2001 only about 20% did. At the same time, economic inequality increased both within individual countries and between rich and poor countries. The importance of public education had already begun to increase in the 18th and 19th centuries but it was not until the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century that compulsory free education was provided to most children worldwide.

In China, the Maoist government implemented industrialization and collectivization policies as part of the Great Leap Forward (1958–1962), leading to the starvation deaths (1959–1961) of 30–40 million people. After these policies were rescinded, China entered a period of economic liberalization and rapid growth, with the economy expanding by 6.6% per year from 1978 to 2003.

In the postwar decades, in a process of decolonization, the African, Asian, and Oceanian colonies of European empires won their formal independence. Postcolonial states in Africa struggled to grow their economies, facing structural barriers such as reliance on the export of commodities rather than manufactured goods. Sub-Saharan Africa was the world region hit hardest by the HIV/AIDS pandemic of the late 20th century. Moreover, Africa experienced high levels of violence, as in the Second Congo War (1998–2003), the deadliest conflict since World War II.

The Near East experienced numerous conflicts, including the Iran-Iraq War, the first and second Gulf wars, and the Syrian Civil War, as well as tensions and conflicts between Israel and Palestine. Development efforts in Latin America were hindered by over-reliance on commodity exports and by political instability, some of it caused by United States involvement in regime change in Latin America.


The early 21st century was marked by growing economic globalization and integration, which brought both benefits and risks to interlinked economies, as exemplified by the Great Recession of the late 2000s and early 2010s. Communications expanded, with smartphones and social media becoming ubiquitous worldwide by the mid-2010s. By the early 2020s, artificial intelligence systems improved to the point of outperforming humans at many circumscribed tasks.

The influence of religion continued to decline in many Western countries, while some parts of the Muslim world saw the rise of fundamentalist movements. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic substantially disrupted global trading, caused recessions in the global economy, and spurred cultural paradigm shifts.

Concerns grew as existential threats from environmental degradation and global warming became increasingly evident, while mitigation efforts, including a shift to sustainable energy, made gradual progress.

== Academic research ==

The study of human history has a long tradition and early precursors were already practiced in the ancient period as attempts to provide comprehensive accounts of the history of the world. Most research before the 20th century focused on histories of individual communities and societies after the prehistoric period. This changed in the late 20th century, when attempts to integrate the diverse narratives into a common context reaching back to the emergence of the first humans became a central research topic. This transition to a widened perspective was accompanied by questioning Eurocentrism and the Western-focused perspective that had previously dominated academic history.

Like in other historical disciplines, the methodology of analyzing textual sources to construct narratives and interpretations of past events plays a central role in the study of human history. The scope of its topic poses the unique challenge of synthesizing a coherent and comprehensive narrative spanning different cultures, regions, and time periods while taking diverse individual perspectives into account. This is also reflected in its interdisciplinary approach by integrating insights from fields belonging to the humanities and the social, biological, and physical sciences, such as other historical disciplines, archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, genetics, paleontology, and geology. The interdisciplinary approach is of particular importance to the study of human history before the invention of writing.

=== Periodization ===
To provide an accessible overview, historians divide human history into different periods organized around key themes, events, or developments that have shaped human societies over time. The number of periods and their time frames depend on the chosen topics, and the transitions between periods are often more fluid than static periodization schemes suggest.

A traditionally influential periodization in European scholarship distinguishes between the ancient, medieval, and modern periods organized around historical events responsible for major shifts in political, economic, and cultural structures to mark the transitions between the periods: first the fall of the Western Roman Empire and later the emergence of the Renaissance. Another periodization divides human history into three periods based on the way humans engage with nature to produce goods. The first transition happened with the emergence of agriculture and husbandry to replace hunting and gathering as the main means of food production. The Industrial Revolution constitutes the second transition. A further approach uses the relations between societies to divide the history of the world into the periods of Middle Eastern dominance before 500 BCE, Eurasian cultural balance until 1500 CE, and Western dominance afterwards. The invention of writing is often used to demark prehistory from the ancient period while another approach divides early history based on the type of tools used in the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages. Historians focusing on religion and culture identify the Axial Age as a key turning point that laid the spiritual and philosophical foundations of many of the world&#x27;s major civilizations. Some historians draw on elements from different approaches to arrive at a more nuanced periodization.

<text>Warren Minor Christopher (October 27, 1925March 18, 2011) was an American attorney, diplomat and statesman who served as the 63rd United States secretary of state from 1993 to 1997. 

Born in Scranton, North Dakota, Christopher clerked for Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas after graduating from Stanford Law School. He became a partner in the firm of O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers and served as Deputy Attorney General from 1967 to 1969 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. He served as Deputy Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter, holding that position from 1977 to 1981. In 1991, he chaired the Christopher Commission, which investigated the Los Angeles Police Department in the wake of the Rodney King incident.

During the 1992 presidential election, Christopher headed Bill Clinton&#x27;s search for a running mate, and Clinton chose Senator Al Gore. After Clinton won the 1992 election, Christopher led the Clinton administration&#x27;s transition process, and he took office as Secretary of State in 1993. As Secretary of State, Christopher sought to expand NATO, broker peace in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and pressure China regarding its human rights practices. He also helped negotiate the Dayton Agreement, which ended the Bosnian War. He left office in 1997, and was succeeded by Madeleine Albright.

Christopher oversaw the Gore campaign&#x27;s Florida recount effort in the aftermath of the disputed 2000 presidential election. At the time of his death in 2011, he was a senior partner at O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers in the firm&#x27;s Century City, California, office. He also served as a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles.

==Early life==

Christopher graduated from Hollywood High School in Los Angeles, and attended the University of Redlands, before transferring to the University of Southern California (USC). He was a member of the college fraternity Kappa Sigma Sigma. He graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from USC in February 1945. From July 1943 to September 1946, he served in the United States Naval Reserve, with active duty as an ensign in the Pacific Theater. He entered Stanford Law School in September 1946, where he founded and became the first editor of the new &quot;Stanford Law Review.&quot; While there, he was also elected to the Order of the Coif.

==Legal career and Deputy Attorney General for Johnson==
Christopher became the first graduate of Stanford Law School to become a U.S. Supreme Court law clerk when he clerked for Justice William O. Douglas from October 1949 to September 1950. He practiced law with the firm of O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers from October 1950 to June 1967, becoming a partner in 1958 and serving as special counsel to Governor Pat Brown. Christopher served as United States Deputy Attorney General from June 1967 until January 20, 1969, after which he rejoined O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers. President Lyndon B. Johnson selected him to assist federal efforts to combat the urban riots in Detroit during July 1967 and in Chicago during April 1968. In 1974, Christopher served as the president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. Attorney General Elliot Richardson considered appointing Christopher as the special counsel to investigate the Watergate scandal, but he declined.

==Deputy Secretary of State for Carter==

Christopher was sworn in on February 26, 1977, as the Deputy Secretary of State and served in that position until January 20, 1981. As Deputy Secretary, he was involved in the successful Iran hostage crisis negotiations, and the resulting Algiers Accords securing the safe release of 52 American hostages in Iran. He also spearheaded the Sino-American relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, helped to win ratification of the Panama Canal treaties, and headed the first interagency group on human rights. President Jimmy Carter awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian award, on January 16, 1981.

==Professional work and achievements==
Christopher&#x27;s professional activities included service as president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, 1974–1975; chairman of the Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary of the American Bar Association, 1975–1976; member of the board of governors of the State Bar of California 1975–1976; and special counsel to California governor Edmund G. Brown in 1959.

Christopher&#x27;s civic activities included the following: member and president of the board of trustees of Stanford University; chairman, Carnegie Corporation of New York board of trustees; director and vice chairman, Council on Foreign Relations; director, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, Los Angeles World Affairs Council; vice chairman of the Governor&#x27;s Commission on the Watts riots (The McCone Commission) in 1965–1966; president, Coordinating Council for Higher Education in the State of California; Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; member of the American Philosophical Society; and chairman emeritus, Pacific Council on International Policy.

In 1981, Christopher received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

In 1991, Christopher served as chairman of the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department, which came to be known as the Christopher Commission. The Commission proposed significant reforms of the Los Angeles Police Department in the aftermath of the Rodney King incident (see 1992 Los Angeles riots), which were approved overwhelmingly at the ballot box. In 1992, Christopher headed the vice presidential search for Governor Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign and served as the Director of his presidential Transition.

==Secretary of State for Clinton==

Serving as Secretary of State from January 20, 1993 until January 17, 1997, Christopher&#x27;s main goals were the enlargement of NATO, establishing peace between Israel and its neighbors, and using economic pressure to force China&#x27;s hand on human rights practices. The major events transpiring during his tenure included the Oslo Accords, the Dayton Agreement, normalization of United States–Vietnam relations, the Rwandan genocide, Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, and the Khobar Towers bombing.

===Assassination attempt on George H. W. Bush, April 1993===
On April 13, 1993, eleven Iraqi Intelligence Service agents smuggled a car bomb into Kuwait City in an attempt to assassinate former President George H. W. Bush as he spoke at Kuwait University. Secretary Christopher, among others, urged President Clinton to make a retaliatory strike against Iraq. On June 26, 1993, the United States launched 23 Tomahawk missiles against the Baghdad intelligence headquarters.

===Oslo Accords, September 1993===
In August 1993, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators meeting in Norway drew up the Oslo Accords, which created the Palestinian Authority in exchange for Palestinian recognition of Israel&#x27;s right to exist. Secretary Christopher accepted Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres&#x27;s offer to host the signing ceremony. The ceremony took place in Washington D.C. on 13 September 1993, with Mahmoud Abbas signing for the Palestine Liberation Organization, Peres signing for the State of Israel, Secretary Christopher signing for the United States and Andrei Kozyrev signing for Russia, in the presence of President Clinton. Christopher was one of the main visionaries and proponent of an integrated Middle East.

===Partnership for Peace NATO expansion, January 1994===
In order to initiate further enlargement of NATO with minimal backlash from Russia, Secretary Christopher promoted the Partnership for Peace program as a stepping-stone into full NATO membership. This was against protests from the Pentagon.

===Rwandan Genocide, 1994===
In what has been considered a terrible failure of the international community, the US and UN failed to intervene to stop the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Over the course of a hundred days, some 800,000 Tutsis were massacred by Hutu militia. 

===China: Delinking human rights and trade status, May 1994===
During the 1992 presidential campaign, then-candidate Clinton blasted President George H. W. Bush for giving China low-tariff trading privileges despite its human rights abuses. Secretary Christopher agreed with this view and believed that the US should use economic pressure to force China to improve its human rights record. However, on May 26, 1994, President Clinton renewed China&#x27;s low-tariff trading privileges, effectively delinking the human rights issue from China&#x27;s trade relations with the US. U.S.-Sino relations improved as a result, with President Jiang Zemin visiting the U.S. in November 1997 and President Clinton visiting China in June 1998.

===Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, September 1994===
On September 19, 1994, a US-led coalition returned Haiti&#x27;s popularly elected President Jean-Bertrande Aristide to power after a 1991 coup by the Haitian Armed Forces under Raoul Cédras had unseated him. The US military effort, known as Operation Uphold Democracy, was largely the product of Colin Powell&#x27;s diplomatic efforts, with little role played by Christopher.

===Israel–Jordan peace treaty, October 1994===
In the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords, Secretary Christopher encouraged Jordan&#x27;s King Hussein to make a peace treaty with Israel. Christopher eventually offered Hussein $200 million in military equipment and $700 million in debt forgiveness to sweeten the deal. On October 27, 1994, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdelsalam al-Majali signed the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. The signing was witnessed by President Clinton and Secretary Christopher. Christopher sought to obtain a similar treaty between Rabin and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, but to no avail.

===Vietnam: Normalizing relations, July 1995===
Working with Senator John McCain, in 1994, Secretary Christopher began actively promoting the normalization of United States–Vietnam relations. At the time, the U.S. had not had an embassy in Vietnam since 1975. The main obstacle to normalization came from Vietnam veterans and POW/MIA support groups who were convinced that Hanoi was not fully cooperating in the search for the remains of US soldiers in Vietnam. However, after Secretary Christopher convinced President Clinton that the Vietnamese government was fully cooperating in these searches, the President announced the formal normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on July 11, 1995.

===Dayton Agreement, November 1995===
In Dayton, Ohio, Secretary Christopher—working with Assistant Secretary Richard Holbrooke—negotiated peace talks between President of Serbia Slobodan Milošević, President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman, and President of Bosnia Alija Izetbegović. The result was the November 1995 Dayton Agreement, which put an end to the Bosnian War.

===Khobar Towers bombing, June 1996===
In the wake of the Khobar Towers bombing, Secretary Christopher traveled to Saudi Arabia to witness the site of the attack. In Dhahran (the home of the Khobar Towers), Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal allegedly promised Christopher that the FBI would have the full cooperation of the Saudi government. Eventually, however, the Saudi government and the FBI repeatedly conflicted during the course of the investigation resulting in many arguments and fights, especially over the role of female FBI agents.

==Retirement==

In addition to several honorary degrees, Christopher received the following awards: the Jefferson Award from the American Institute for Public Service for the Greatest Public Service Performed by an Elected or Appointed Official; the UCLA Medal; the Harold Weill Medal from New York University; the James A. Garfield Baller Award; the Thomas Jefferson Award in Law from the University of Virginia Law School; and the Louis Stein Award from Fordham Law School.

Christopher&#x27;s picture hangs in the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, near pictures of John Kerry, Robert McNamara, Elmo Zumwalt, and other American dignitaries, in commemoration of his visit to Vietnam, after normalization of relations between the two countries.

At the 1999 unveiling of his portrait at the Department of State, attended by President Clinton, Christopher remarked: &quot;To anyone who has served in Washington, there is something oddly familiar about [having your portrait painted]. First, you&#x27;re painted into a corner, then you&#x27;re hung out to dry and, finally, you&#x27;re framed.&quot;

He was sent to supervise the contested Florida recount for Al Gore&#x27;s campaign in the 2000 United States presidential election. In the 2008 film &quot;Recount&quot;, which covers the days following the controversial election, Christopher was portrayed by British actor John Hurt. He was a member of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP) Board of Advisors.

He was an Advisory Board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy.
Former Secretaries of State James Baker and Christopher served as Co-Chairs of the Miller Center&#x27;s National War Powers Commission. Baker and Christopher testified on March 5 before the House Foreign Affairs Committee about the War Powers Consultation Act of 2009 – the statute that the Commission unanimously recommended in its July 2008 report. The statute is designed to replace the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and provide for more meaningful consultation between the President and Congress on matters of war.

From 2003 until his death, Christopher taught a small seminar course on international affairs as part of the Honors Program at UCLA.

==Family==
Warren Christopher married twice. He married Joan Southgate Workman
on June 14, 1949, in San Diego, California; the couple had a daughter, Lynn (born May 30, 1952). They divorced in 1955. 

He was married to Marie Wyllis from 1956 until his death; the couple had two sons: Scott (born December 27, 1957) and Thomas (born July 24, 1959), and a daughter, Kristen (born March 26, 1963). 

Christopher had five grandchildren: Andrew, Lauren, Warren, and Chloe Christopher, and Christopher Henderson. 

He wrote &quot;In the Stream of History: Shaping Foreign Policy for a New Era&quot; (1998) and &quot;Chances of a Lifetime&quot; (2001).

==Other==
Christopher was a recipient of the state of North Dakota&#x27;s Roughrider Award.

He was a senior partner at O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers.

===World Justice Project===

Christopher served as an Honorary Co-Chair for the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the Rule of Law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.

==Death==
Christopher died at his home in Los Angeles on March 18, 2011, from kidney and bladder cancer. He was 85 years old. He was survived by his wife and four children from two marriages. He is interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills.

President Obama described Christopher as a &quot;resolute pursuer of peace&quot; for his work in the Middle East and the Balkans. Hillary Clinton described Christopher as a &quot;diplomat&#x27;s diplomat – talented, dedicated and exceptionally wise&quot;. He was described as &quot;the best public servant I ever knew&quot; by President Jimmy Carter in his memoirs. On March 19, 2011, Carter stated that &quot;[America] has lost a great and revered leader&quot;.

<doc id="435277" wikidata="Q1647030" url="?curid=435277" title="Marquess of Hertford">
<text>The titles of Earl of Hertford and Marquess of Hertford have been created several times in the peerages of England and Great Britain.

The third Earldom of Hertford was created in 1559 for Edward Seymour, who was simultaneously created Baron Beauchamp of Hache. His grandson William Seymour was subsequently created Marquess of Hertford and restored to the title of Duke of Somerset; the Marquessate became extinct in 1675 and the other three titles in 1750.

The present Marquessate was created in 1793. Lord Hertford holds the subsidiary titles of Earl of Yarmouth (Peerage of Great Britain, 1793), Earl of Hertford (Peerage of Great Britain, 1750), Viscount Beauchamp (Peerage of Great Britain, 1750), Baron Conway, of Ragley in the County of Warwick (Peerage of England, 1703), and Baron Conway of Killultagh, of Killultagh in the County of Antrim (Peerage of Ireland, 1712). Lord Hertford&#x27;s heir uses the style &quot;Earl of Yarmouth&quot;.

The Marquesses of Hertford are members of the Seymour family headed by the Duke of Somerset. Francis Seymour (1679–1732) was the fourth son of Sir Edward Seymour of Berry Pomeroy, 4th Baronet, a descendant of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (Sir Edward&#x27;s grandson Sir Edward Seymour, 6th Baronet, of Berry Pomeroy succeeded as 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750). Upon the death of his elder brother, Francis succeeded to the estates of his relative Edward Conway, 1st Earl of Conway. In 1703 he was created Baron Conway in the Peerage of England and assumed the additional surname of Conway. In 1712 he was created Baron Conway of Killultagh in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1750 his son Francis Seymour-Conway, 2nd Baron Conway, was created Viscount Beauchamp and Earl of Hertford. These were revivals of titles previously held by the Dukes of Somerset, which had become extinct the same year on the death of Seymour-Conway&#x27;s kinsman Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset. In 1793 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Yarmouth and Marquess of Hertford. The latter title had also previously been held by the Dukes of Somerset, but had become extinct in 1675 (see below).

The family seat is Ragley Hall, near Alcester, Warwickshire.

<text>Marquess of the County of Bute, shortened in general usage to Marquess of Bute, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1796 for John Stuart, 4th Earl of Bute.

==Family history==
John Stuart was the member of a family that descended from John Stewart (1360–1449), Sheriff of Bute, a natural son of Robert II of Scotland and his mistress Moira Leitch, married to Janet Sympil and in 1407 to Elizabeth Graham. This John Stewart was granted the lands of Bute, Arran and Cumbrae by his father. He was known as the &#x27;Black Stewart&#x27; because of his dark complexion; his brother John Stewart of Dundonald was known as the &#x27;Red Stewart&#x27;. The grant of lands was confirmed in 1400 by a charter of Robert III.

About 1385, John Stewart of Bute was granted the hereditary office of Sheriff of Bute by his father Robert II. He died in 1449, aged 89. At about the time of Mary, Queen of Scots, the family adopted the spelling of &#x27;Stuart&#x27;, which she had used while living in France. James Stuart, seventh in descent from the Black Stewart, was created a , of Bute, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 28 March 1627. His grandson, the third Baronet, represented Bute in the Parliament of Scotland and was one of the Commissioners that negotiated the Union between Scotland and England. On 14 April 1703, he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as , , and . He was succeeded by his son, the 2nd Earl of Bute and 4th Baronet, who sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire. On his early death, the titles passed to his son, the third Earl. He became a politician and favourite of George III and served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1762 to 1763. Lord Bute married Mary, a daughter of Edward Wortley Montagu and his wife the writer Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In 1761, Lord Bute&#x27;s wife Mary was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain in her own right as , of Wortley in the County of York, with remainder to the heirs male of her body by her then husband Lord Bute. Her son became the first Marquess of Bute, whose eldest son and heir John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart (who predeceased his father) married Lady Elizabeth Penelope, daughter and heiress of Patrick McDouall-Crichton, 6th Earl of Dumfries. Lord Mount Stuart&#x27;s eldest son John succeeded his maternal grandfather as seventh Earl of Dumfries in 1803, and his paternal grandfather as second Marquess of Bute in 1814. In 1805, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Crichton before Stuart. He was succeeded by his only child, the third Marquess. He was an antiquarian, scholar, philanthropist and architectural patron and also held the post of Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire. It was the 3rd Marquess who in 1868 first converted to Catholicism, since which time the family have remained of that faith. His son the fourth Marquess was also Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire. His grandson, John Crichton-Stuart, 6th Marquess of Bute, succeeded his father and was Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire from 1967 to 1975. As of 2021, the peerages are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, John Crichton-Stuart, 8th Marquess of Bute.

===Bute family titles===
The Marquesses of Bute have important ancestors not only in Scotland but also in Wales, including the first Lord Herbert of Cardiff, son and heir of Richard Herbert of Ewyas. He was also created Earl of Pembroke. After the Stuart Restoration, most of the Herbert family property was sold, and the rest was owned by Thomas, Viscount Windsor, who married Charlotte, the only child of Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke. In 1766, Viscount Windsor&#x27;s granddaughter, Charlotte Jane, was married to John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart (1744-1814), the son and heir of the 3rd Earl of Bute, prime minister from 1762 to 1763, and through this marriage great estates in south Wales came into the Bute family. In 1776, sixteen years before he succeeded his father as Earl of Bute, he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain in his own right as , of Cardiff Castle in the County of Glamorgan, in recognition of his substantial Welsh estates. In 1796, he was further honoured when he was created and , in the Isle of Wight, revivals of the titles once held by his wife&#x27;s family, and . These titles are also in the Peerage of Great Britain.

==Other offices and duties==
The marquess of Bute is the hereditary keeper of Rothesay Castle, a privilege granted to the ancestor of the Earls and Marquesses of Bute, John Stewart, by Robert II during the 14th century. In this capacity, the Crichton-Stuart family had been responsible for the upkeep and restoration of the castle up until the 1960s.

This branch of the Stewart (also Stuart) family previously held the office of Hereditary High Steward of Scotland, an office now held by the duke of Rothesay, in his capacity as a direct descendant of the House of Stuart.

== Other family members ==
Many other members of the family have gained distinction. Robert Stuart, a younger son of the first Baronet, was created a Baronet in his own right in 1707. The Hon. James Stuart-Mackenzie, a younger son of the second Earl, succeeded to the Mackenzie estates through his paternal grandmother and assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Mackenzie. He was a member of parliament. The Hon. James Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, second son of the third Earl, was a politician and the father of James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe. Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Stuart, fourth son of the third Earl, was a distinguished soldier and the father of Charles Stuart, 1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay. The Most Reverend the Hon. William Stuart, fifth son of the third Earl, was Archbishop of Armagh. His son Sir William Stuart was a member of parliament. His eldest son William Stuart also sat as a member of parliament. Lady Louisa Stuart, daughter of the third Earl, was a writer. Lord Evelyn Stuart, second son of the first Marquess, was a soldier and politician. Lord Henry Crichton-Stuart, third son of the first Marquess, was the father of Henry Villiers-Stuart, 1st Baron Stuart de Decies (see the Baron Stuart de Decies for more information on this branch of the family).

Lord William Stuart, fourth son of the first Marquess, was a captain in the Royal Navy and Member of Parliament. Lord George Stuart (1780–1841), fifth son of the first Marquess, was a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy. Lord Dudley Stuart, sixth son of the first Marquess (and eldest from his second marriage), was a member of parliament. Lord Patrick Crichton-Stuart, second son of Lord Mount Stuart, eldest son of the first Marquess, was Member of Parliament for Cardiff. His eldest son James Crichton-Stuart also represented this constituency in Parliament. Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, second son of the third Marquess, was also Member of Parliament for Cardiff before his early death in the First World War. Lord Colum Crichton-Stuart, third and youngest son of the third Marquess, sat as Member of Parliament for Northwich for many years. Lord Robert Crichton-Stuart Crichton-Stuart, second son of the fourth Marquess, was Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire. Lord Rhidian Crichton-Stuart, fifth and youngest son of the fourth Marquess, was a British member of the International Legislative Assembly of the Tangier International Zone.

The Earls and Marquesses of Bute originally used the courtesy title Lord Mount Stuart for the heir apparent. After the Earldom of Dumfries was inherited by the second Marquess, the heir apparent has been styled Earl of Dumfries and his heir apparent is styled Lord Mount Stuart. However, the current Marquess John Bryson Crichton-Stuart was styled as Lord Mount Stuart for some years after his father inherited the marquessate in 1993. This was because his father was well known at the time as Johnny Dumfries, Earl of Dumfries. Subsequently, the seventh Marquess became known as John or Johnny Bute and his heir adopted Jack Dumfries for short.

== Heraldic achievement (coat of arms) ==
==Seat==
===Mount Stuart House===
Mount Stuart House is the seat of the family of the Stuarts of Bute, on land which has been in the family since 1157, on the Isle of Bute.
James Stuart, 2nd Earl of Bute, built a new Georgian house here which was finished in 1719. In 1877, this was damaged by fire, although the walls and most of the contents survived the blaze. A new Victorian Mount Stuart House was then built and was the first in Scotland to have electric lighting throughout, as well as having the world&#x27;s first heated pool.

Although Mount Stuart House is the family seat of the Marquesses of Bute, the Mount Stuart Trust has operated it as a business since 1989.

==Former seats==
===Dumfries House===
In 1814, Dumfries House, near Cumnock, East Ayrshire, was inherited by John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute, and the property remained in the Crichton-Stuart family for two centuries. In 1885, the 3rd Marquess of Bute commissioned Robert Weir Schultz to design the pavilions. The heads of the Crichton-Stuart family had their main residence at Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute. In the later 20th century, the house was lived in by the Dowager Marchioness of Bute, Lady Eileen, until her death in 1993. The 6th Marquess died a few months later, and the house passed to her grandson the 7th Marquess, the racing driver known as John Bute.

Because of maintenance problems, in 2003 the 7th Marquess decided to sell Dumfries House and to send the contents to auction. However, Charles III, (then)-Prince of Wales was able to arrange for the sale of the house, its contents, and its 2000-acre estate to a consortium of organisations, including the Scottish government, the Art Fund, the Garfield Weston Foundation, the Monument Trust, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and Save Britain&#x27;s Heritage. The Prince&#x27;s Charities Foundation borrowed much of the £45m total sale price.

===Cardiff Castle===
The 3rd Marquess worked with the architect William Burges in creating two Gothic revival castles in south Wales. The Work of William Burges at Cardiff Castle has been remodeled from the original Roman fort and the later Norman motte-and-bailey; it has since passed through the hands of many noble families until in 1766, it passed by marriage to the Bute family. 
The 2nd Marquess of Bute was key in developing south Wales into one of the biggest coal exporters in its time by developing the port and Cardiff docks. Cardiff castle was inherited by his son John, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, who was extremely wealthy. The project begun in 1866 with the architect William Burges who transformed the castle grounds. Within the two towers one of which is a clock, he also designed expert interiors, with murals, stained glass, marble, gilding and elaborate wood carvings. The rooms included are the Mediterranean gardens and Italian, then also Arabian winter smoking room within the Herbert tower. 
Despite both previous Marquesses dying in their 50&#x27;s, the project was completed by the 4th Marquess. Then after death of the 4th Marquess of Bute, the family gave away the castle and its surrounding parks to city of Cardiff. For a quarter of a century, the Castle was leased by the National College of Music and Drama, and since 1974 Cardiff Castle has become one of Wales’s most popular tourist destinations.

===Castell Coch===
The Herbert family ruins were acquired by the Earls of Bute in 1760 when John, 3rd Earl of Bute, married Lady Charlotte Windsor, sharing her inheritance in south Wales. His grandson, The 2nd Marquess of Bute, whose wealth came from Cardiff Docks, eventually inherited the castle. The 2nd Marquess carried out exploration for iron ore at Castell Coch in 1827 and considered establishing an ironworks there.

The 3rd Marquess of Bute, another John Crichton-Stuart, inherited Castell Coch and the family estates as a child in 1848. On his coming of age, Bute&#x27;s landed estates and industrial inheritance made him one of the wealthiest men in the world. He had a wide range of interests including archaeology, theology, linguistics and history. In 1850 the antiquarian George Clark surveyed Castell Coch and published his findings, the first major scholarly work about the castle.
Castell Coch has been used for over 700 years, the previous owner were the De Clare Family. The castle was rarely used and given to the British government by the 5th Marquess in 1950.

<text>A negret () in Catalan myths and legends, especially those of Majorca, is a small, dark-skinned sprite who, if touched with a candle by a mortal, instantly turns into a trove of coins. The word is the diminutive of the Catalan &quot;negre&quot; (&quot;black&quot;), and out of this context could mean a small child of a dark-complexioned race.

Also, negret is an emotional sadness which occurs after years and years, perhaps even decades, of building equity in belongings and a home. It is a romanticism, a depressive feeling, and a present desire. The effort to build and gain all of the stuff which has been purchased (the estate’s entirety) has been expended. Now, there is a tiredness and a sleeplike dreamy sadness from having spent all the energy. Negret is the sadness from the expelled energy required to build an estate.

<text>The Annapolis Convention, formally titled as a Meeting of Commissioners to Remedy Defects of the Federal Government, was a national political convention held September 11–14, 1786 in the old Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland (The Maryland Society, Sons of the American Revolution claim the location was at Mann&#x27;s Tavern where some of the delegates possibly dined and slept.), in which twelve delegates from five U.S. states (New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia) gathered to discuss and develop a consensus on reversing the protectionist trade barriers that each state had erected. At the time, under the Articles of Confederation, each state was largely independent from the others, and the national government had no authority to regulate trade between and among the states. New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and North Carolina had appointed commissioners, who failed to arrive in Annapolis in time to attend the meeting, and Connecticut, Maryland, South Carolina, and Georgia had taken no action at all. The convention also related to George Washington&#x27;s plans concerning the waterways connecting the Potomac and the Ohio River.

==Convention==
Most of the delegates to the meeting were tasked only to take up the issue of trade among the states, but New Jersey&#x27;s delegates were authorized to discuss a broader scope of reforms. The group realized that the issue of trade touched upon many other aspects of the Confederation and that a future meeting with a broader scope would be necessary to adequately address the problems.

The final report of the convention was adopted unanimously and sent to the Congress of the Confederation and to the states. Its main author was Alexander Hamilton. The report sought support for a broader constitutional convention to be held the following May in Philadelphia. It expressed the hope that more states would be represented and that their delegates or deputies would be authorized to examine areas broader than trade alone.

==Aftermath==
Because of the few representatives in attendance, their authority was limited. It is unclear how much weight the convention&#x27;s call carried, but the urgency of the need for constitutional reform was highlighted by a number of rebellions that took place all over the country. Although most of them were easily suppressed, Shays&#x27; Rebellion lasted from August 1786 to February 1787. The rebellion called attention to both popular discontent and government weakness.

The direct result of the Annapolis Convention&#x27;s report and the ensuing events was the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, when the United States Constitution was drafted.

==Delegates==
These states were represented with delegates: 
*New York: Egbert Benson and Alexander Hamilton
*New Jersey: Abraham Clark, William Houston, and James Schureman
*Pennsylvania: Tench Coxe
*Delaware: George Read, John Dickinson, and Richard Bassett
*Virginia: Edmund Randolph, James Madison, and St. George Tucker

<text>O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers LLP is an American multinational law firm founded in Los Angeles in 1885. The firm employs approximately 740 lawyers and has offices in California, Washington, D.C., New York City, Beijing, Brussels, Hong Kong, London, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo.

==History==
The firm was founded on January 2, 1885 as &quot;Graves &amp; O&#x27;Melveny&quot; by Henry O&#x27;Melveny and Jackson Graves. At its founding, the firm consisted of the two attorneys themselves, with zero staff. The original one-paragraph written partnership agreement provided that &quot;proceeds and expenses of said business&quot; were to be split with three-fifths to Graves and two-fifths to O&#x27;Melveny, &quot;until some other rate of division is agreed upon&quot;. The firm started with a single one-room office in an office building at 248 North Main Street in Los Angeles. That building was renumbered in 1904 to 342 North Main Street and was later demolished when the Santa Ana Freeway was built through its site. 

The firm gained traction through its work on land litigation surrounding the ownership of California&#x27;s Spanish haciendas and its handling of the legalities of hydroelectric power, which helped to transform the arid basin of Los Angeles into a car-centric metropolis. The firm became &quot;O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers&quot; when Chief Justice of California Louis Wescott Myers joined the firm after retiring from the Supreme Court of California in 1926.

In 1977, O&#x27;Melveny hired William T. Coleman, Jr., who had helped the country move toward desegregation 23 years prior as a lead strategist for the plaintiffs in the landmark &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;.

The former chair of the firm, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., who serves at the firm&#x27;s Washington, D.C. office, was White House Counsel during the Reagan administration. Former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher (1925-2011), who served as the firm&#x27;s chairman from 1981 to 1991, was a senior partner at the firm&#x27;s Century City, California, office. Christopher supervised the largest period of growth in the firm&#x27;s history, expanding to seven countries. Litigation partner Bradley J. Butwin became chair of the firm in 2012; his term extends until 2025.

The firm defended Donald Trump against a lawsuit over Trump University. O&#x27;Melveny vetted the president&#x27;s nominees. The firm represented the Trump inaugural committee when it was investigated by the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Southern District of New York. O&#x27;Melveny also represented President Trump&#x27;s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, over allegations of conflicted investments.

In November 2023, amid a wave of antisemitic incidents at elite U.S. law schools, O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers was among a group of major law firms who sent a letter to top law school deans warning them that an escalation in incidents targeting Jewish students would have corporate hiring consequences. The letter said &quot;We look to you to ensure your students who hope to join our firms after graduation are prepared to be an active part of workplace communities that have zero tolerance policies for any form of discrimination or harassment, much less the kind that has been taking place on some law school campuses.&quot;

== Reputation ==
The firm ranked number one on Vault.com&#x27;s 2019 list of &quot;Best Firms to Work For,&quot; a ranking of the world&#x27;s law firms based on quality of life for attorneys. It received the highest rankings for &quot;Job Satisfaction&quot;, &quot;Associate/Partner Relations&quot;, &quot;Best Firm Culture&quot;, &quot;Quality of work&quot;, &quot;Transparency&quot;, &quot;Hours Requirements&quot;, &quot;Summer Associate Program&quot;, and &quot;Attorney Development.&quot; The firm ranked number six for &quot;Best Attorney Compensation.&quot; According to Above the Law, first-year associates at the firm are paid a base salary of $215,000 with bonuses available yearly. Summer associates are paid the same salary, although it is prorated over 10 weeks (amounting to $3,700 per week). Vault ranked O&#x27;Melveny as the 4th most selective law firm in the world in 2019. However, a former attorney of the firm, and winner of the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s &quot;Law Blog&#x27;s&quot; Lawyer of the Year award in 2007, has criticized the firm&#x27;s handling of discrimination and sexual abuse matters.

O&#x27;Melveny ranked in the Top 10 for the 5th consecutive year on the 2016 &quot;A-List,&quot; a measure of the nation&#x27;s most &quot;well-rounded&quot; firms. The firm has been a winner, finalist, or honorable mention recipient in every year of the biennial Litigation Department of the Year contest since its 2002 inception, one of only two firms to achieve that distinction.

It is one of the highest-paying law firms in the United States.

<text>Marquess of Waterford is a title in the Peerage of Ireland and the premier marquessate in that peerage. It was created in 1789 for the Anglo-Irish politician George Beresford, 2nd Earl of Tyrone. The title is presently held by Henry Beresford, 9th Marquess of Waterford.

== History ==
The progenitor of the family was a companion of Strongbow, from whom he obtained grant for extensive lands in Waterford in the 11th century.[1] The barony was created in 1535 for Sir Richard le Poer.

James Power, 3rd Earl of Tyrone, who was also the 8th Baron Power, held both his titles by letters patent (dated 1535 and 1637 respectively), which specified that the titles would be inherited by heirs male of the grantee. When he died in 1704 however, his only child was a daughter, Lady Catharine Power. Lady Catharine therefore inherited the land. Lady Catharine grew up and married in 1717 an Irish politician, Sir Marcus Beresford, 4th Baronet.[3] After a lawsuit with John Power, Sir Marcus and Lady Catharine retained the Power property, and Sir Marcus was raised into the peerage of Ireland by creating him Viscount Tyrone in 1720. In 1720, he was created both Baron Beresford, of Beresford, in the County of Cavan, and Viscount Tyrone in the peerage of Ireland. After the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, he was further elevated in 1746 as Earl of Tyrone in the peerage of Ireland (the same name of title as that of his father-in-law, but a new creation). In 1767, four years after his death, the Dowager Countess of Tyrone was confirmed with the hereditary peerage title Baroness La Poer in the peerage of Ireland (created by writ ca. 1650). Lord Tyrone was succeeded by his fourth but eldest surviving son, the second Earl, who also inherited the title Baron La Poer from his mother in 1769. In 1786 he was created Baron Tyrone, of Haverfordwest in the County of Pembroke, in the peerage of Great Britain. Three years later he was made Marquess of Waterford in the peerage of Ireland. The titles descended in the direct line until the death of his grandson, the third Marquess, in 1859. The late Marquess was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Marquess. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-great-great-grandson, the ninth Marquess, who succeeded his father in 2015.

Several other members of the Beresford family have also gained distinction. John Beresford, fifth son of the first Earl, was an influential statesman. Marcus Beresford, eldest son of John Beresford, represented Dungarvan in the Irish Parliament. His second son was the Conservative politician William Beresford, who was the father of Mostyn Beresford (1835–1911), a Lieutenant-General in the Army, and of Edward Marcus Beresford (1836–1896), a Major-General in the Army. The Right Reverend George Beresford, second son of John Beresford, was Bishop of Kilmore. His son the Most Reverend Marcus Beresford was Archbishop of Armagh. He was the father of George Beresford, a politician, and of Major Henry Marcus Beresford, who was the father of the photographer George Charles Beresford. John Claudius Beresford, third son of John Beresford, was a politician. William Beresford, seventh son of the first Earl, was Archbishop of Tuam and was created Baron Decies in 1812. Lord John Beresford, second surviving son of the first Marquess, was Archbishop of Armagh. Lord George Beresford, younger son of the first Marquess, was a politician. William Beresford, illegitimate son of the first Marquess, was a Field Marshal in the British Army and was created Viscount Beresford in 1823. John Beresford, illegitimate son of the first Marquess, was a soldier and politician and was created a baronet in 1814 (see Beresford-Peirse baronets). Lord Charles Beresford, second son of the fourth Marquess, was a naval commander and politician and was created Baron Beresford in 1916. Lord William Beresford, third son of the fourth Marquess, was a soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross. Lord Marcus Beresford, fourth son of the fourth Marquess, was a courtier. The Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford enjoyed partying as much as sport. He was one of several wild sportsmen who sprayed the tollgate and houses of Melton Mowbray with red paint. The phrase “painting the town red” was born.

The eldest son of the Marquess is styled with the courtesy title &quot;Earl of Tyrone&quot; and the Earl&#x27;s eldest son as &quot;Lord Le Poer&quot;. Additionally, the Marquess club is White&#x27;s, where the family have been members since the 18th century. The family seat is Curraghmore, near Portlaw, County Waterford, in the Republic of Ireland. The Beresford family, owned land in various parts of Ireland, including almost 40,000 acres in county Waterford, 26,000 in county Wicklow and over 4,500 acres in county Leitrim. The family remain amongst the largest land owners in all Ireland. 

All but the 4th Lord Waterford was awarded the Order of Saint Patrick. The 6th Lord Waterford was the last to receive the honour. A special treasure of the family is a necklace of pearls, once the property of Mary Queen of Scots, who gave it to Mary Hamilton the night before the Queen’s execution.

Not to be confused with the ancient title (created in 1446 and still extant) of Earl of Waterford (also in the peerage of Ireland) of the Earl of Shrewsbury (the Earl of Waterford is also Lord High Steward of Ireland).

<doc id="435290" wikidata="Q912176" url="?curid=435290" title="Brian Flemming">
<text>Brian Flemming is an American film director, playwright and activist. His films include &quot;Hang Your Dog in the Wind&quot;, &quot;Nothing So Strange&quot;, and &quot;The God Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;. His musicals include &quot;Bat Boy: The Musical&quot;, which won the LA Weekly Theater Award, Lucille Lortel Award, and Outer Critics Circle Award. He advocates for the free-culture movement and is an outspoken atheist.

== Early career ==

Flemming&#x27;s first feature film was the low-budget &quot;Hang Your Dog in the Wind&quot;. Partly to promote his film, Flemming co-founded a punk film festival in Park City, Utah, called the Slumdance Film Festival, a pun on the name of the Slamdance Film Festival (which in turn referred to the Sundance Film Festival).

Slumdance brought Flemming to the attention of John Pierson, who later hired Flemming to work as a director and segment producer for Pierson&#x27;s Independent Film Channel magazine-style show called &quot;Split Screen.&quot;

== &quot;Bat Boy&quot; ==

After Slumdance, Flemming turned his attention from indie film to theater with &quot;Bat Boy: The Musical&quot;. The stage musical is based on a story about a half-bat half-boy from the tabloid &quot;Weekly World News&quot;. Flemming co-wrote &quot;Bat Boy&quot; with Keythe Farley and Laurence O&#x27;Keefe. The musical grew from a Los Angeles theater to winning the LA Weekly Theater Award for Musical of the Year Award for 1999, plus four Ovation Award nominations and six Drama-Logue Awards.

&quot;Bat Boy: The Musical&quot; made its way to a New York production in March 2001, for which the play won the Lucille Lortel Award for Best Musical, the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Musical Off-Broadway, and six Drama Desk nominations. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described &quot;Bat Boy&quot; as a &quot;giggling cult hit&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It is astonishing what intelligent wit can accomplish&quot;. The musical ran in New York through December 2001.

== &quot;Nothing So Strange&quot; ==

Flemming released a faux documentary about the assassination of Bill Gates called &quot;Nothing So Strange&quot;. Bill Gates said through a spokesman that it was &quot;very disappointing that a movie maker would do something like this&quot;. &quot;Nothing So Strange&quot; debuted at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. &quot;Variety&quot; called it, &quot;a crackling good movie... [that] may be the ideal prototype film for the digital age&quot;. The film won the Claiborne Pell New York Times Award for Original Vision at the 2002 Newport Film Festival.

On 24 October 2003 the film had a simultaneous debut in theaters and as an Internet download. It was released on DVD in December 2004.

== &quot;The God Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; ==
In 2005, Flemming released his third feature-length film, the documentary &quot;The God Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;. Through interviews with biblical and folklore scholars, Flemming investigates the evidence for the existence of Jesus, concluding that it is highly improbable that the Christian savior ever actually lived. He then discusses the beliefs of conservative Christian fundamentalists, Christian moderates (who, he states, simply enable the fundamentalists), and returns to confront the principal of the fundamentalist Christian school he attended as a child. Flemming launched three media campaigns to support his documentary: War on Christmas, War on Easter, and Blasphemy Challenge. The Blasphemy Challenge was the most successful of the three publicity stunts, gaining coverage by Newsweek, NBC News, Fox News and many other media outlets, and participation by Penn Jillette.

== Activism ==
In addition to working in film and theater, Flemming is an activist on copyright issues. He has released &quot;Nothing So Strange&quot; as an open source project, which means all of the raw footage that makes up the film is released without copyright restrictions for anyone to use. The final cut of the film, however, remains protected by copyright.

Flemming founded the organization Free Cinema, which encourages feature filmmakers to create films under two rules:
# No money may be spent on the production, and
# The film must be released under a copyleft license.

Flemming claims that filmmaking can now be &quot;as inexpensive as writing novels&quot; and that the copylefting practice is a way for new artists to gain notice and distribution in a marketplace dominated by large corporations. Free Cinema was inspired by the Free Software Movement, which is guided by similar principles of freedom. Flemming is also the owner and operator of Fair Use Press, which distributes e-books critical of public figures such as Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Arnold Schwarzenegger for their stance on intellectual property law.

During the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival, Flemming, who had been invited to sit on the festival&#x27;s documentary jury, saw a demo of the video game Super Columbine Massacre RPG! and hearing about it having its nomination pulled by the festival&#x27;s founder, convinced fellow jurors to award it a &quot;Special Jury Prize&quot; for Best Documentary (an unofficial award not endorsed by the festival). The festival&#x27;s founder, Peter Baxter, later told Flemming that legal considerations prevented SCMRPG from receiving the award.

<text>&quot;Chosen Realm&quot; is the 12th episode from the third season of the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. The series&#x27;s 64th episode, it first aired on January 14, 2004. &quot;Enterprise&quot; is taken over by a group of religious fanatics called Triannons and Captain Archer must re-take it before it&#x27;s too late.

==Plot==

Commander Tucker and Ensign Mayweather are gathering readings on a third sphere in the Delphic Expanse. &quot;Enterprise&quot; receives a distress call from a Triannon ship which reports they have been damaged by a spatial anomaly. &quot;Enterprise&quot; takes them aboard, and D&#x27;Jamat, the leader of the group, has dinner with Captain Archer where he explains they have been on a year-long pilgrimage to a sphere. They believe deities, called the &quot;Makers,&quot; constructed the spheres to transform the expanse, their “Chosen Realm,” into a paradise. D&#x27;Jamat then rejects T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s scientific logic that there are only fifty-nine known spheres, believing there are thousands.

Later, D&#x27;Jamat demands Archer turn over control of the ship or it will be destroyed, and demonstrates this by having one of his group self-detonate, killing one crew member. Having little choice, Archer submits. D&#x27;Jamat then sets a course for his home world and explains that he intends to use &quot;Enterprise&quot; to end a religious civil war that has embroiled his planet for a century. D&#x27;Jamat also examines the ship&#x27;s records and finds that &quot;Enterprise&quot; had extensive contact with the spheres—a severe violation under his faith. He then erases 19 XB of sphere data, and demands that Archer choose one crew member to die.

While Archer is contemplating his decision he approaches Yarrick, D&#x27;Jamat&#x27;s deputy, questioning his resolve, but Yarrick rebuffs him. Archer then tells D&#x27;Jamat that he has selected himself to be killed, but requests it be done using a device they use for &quot;waste disposal&quot;. That device turns out to be the transporter, which T&#x27;Pol uses to beam Archer elsewhere on the ship. Archer then contacts Doctor Phlox and they develop an airborne agent to neutralize the Triannon&#x27;s organic explosives. Archer again confronts Yarrick and convinces him to help disperse the agent throughout the ship, and learns that the religious war is primarily based around a difference of opinion over whether it took nine or ten days for the Makers to complete their work. Meanwhile, four ships from the &quot;heretic&quot; Triannon faction intercept &quot;Enterprise&quot;. During the fight, the crew manage to subdue D&#x27;Jamat and end the battle. In the brig, D&#x27;Jamat remains convinced his actions were justified, so Archer takes him down to their planet. The Triannons are left staring in horror at their completely devastated world, which lies in ruins, having been ravaged by the religious war.

== Production ==
Guest star Conor O&#x27;Farrell who played the religious leader D&#x27;Jamat, was previously on &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the season one episode &quot;Rogue Planet&quot; as a hunter.

== Reception ==
&quot;Chosen Realm&quot; is noted as a &quot;menacing&quot; plot and notes how there is a threat to Archer and the crew of &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Reviewers noted that the episode copies the ending of the TOS episode &quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot;, with Bureau42 noting the simple switch of &quot;using religion instead of racism&quot;.

Herc of &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot; gave the episode 2.5 out of five and is critical of the episode for being a remake and notes that the episode &quot;ends essentially as &quot;Last Battlefield&quot; did, with the antagonist learning firsthand that fanaticism has decimated his homeworld.&quot; He also sees similarities to other episodes: the pony-tailed supermen of &quot;Space Seed&quot;; the hippy religious fanatics of &quot;The Way to Eden&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;; and echoes of the Bajorans from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; who worship artifacts left by ancient aliens.

&quot;IGN&quot; gave the episode seven out of ten, and wrote: &quot;Overall, &#x27;Chosen Realm&#x27; has more positives than negatives, which puts it on the short of tolerable episodes during the run of &quot;Enterprise&quot;. This is the kind of episode the series should have been doing three years ago. Had there been this kind of foundation to build upon, maybe the series wouldn&#x27;t be the train wreck that we&#x27;re currently enduring.&quot;

Jamahl Epsicokhan of &quot;Jammer&#x27;s Reviews&quot;, discusses how Season 3 has taken on the habit of grabbing action/fighting sequences to drive the climax of episodes. So the absurd taking control of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; again by aliens provides an opportunity for &quot;the action climax ... to become a predictable punctuation mark&quot;.

&quot;The Digital Fix&quot; said that guest actor Conor O&#x27;Farrell delivered a strong performance in this episode.

== Home media release ==
&quot;Chosen Realm&quot; was released as part of the season three DVD box set, released in the United States on September 27, 2005. The Blu-ray release of &quot;Enterprise&quot; was announced in early 2013, and the season three box set was released on January 7, 2014. The Blu-Ray has a surround sound 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track for English, as well as German, French, and Japanese audio tracks in Dolby audio.

<doc id="435293" wikidata="Q3294788" url="?curid=435293" title="Marquess of Downshire">
<text>Marquess of Downshire is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1789 for Wills Hill, 1st Earl of Hillsborough, a former Secretary of State.

Hill had already been created Earl of Hillsborough and Viscount Kilwarlin of County Down in the Peerage of Ireland in 1751 with remainder, in default of male issue of his own, to his uncle Arthur Hill, 1st Viscount Dungannon. He was further created Baron Harwich, of Harwich in the County of Essex, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1756 with a seat in the British House of Lords. In 1772 he was further ennobled with a second Earldom of Hillsborough and as Viscount Fairford in the County of Gloucester, both in the Peerage of Great Britain.

Downshire was the eldest son of Trevor Hill, who had been created Viscount Hillsborough and Baron Hill of Kilwarlin in County Down, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1717, with remainder, in default of male issue of his own, to the male issue of his father, Michael Hill. Trevor Hill was the brother of the aforementioned Arthur Hill, 1st Viscount Dungannon.

In 2013, the 9th Marquess succeeded, under the terms of a special remainder of 1802, to the title Baron Sandys. The barony had been created for Mary Hill, Marchioness of Downshire, the widow of the second Marquess, with remainder to her younger sons, Lord Arthur Moyses William Hill, Lord Marcus Hill, Lord Augustus Hill and Lord George Hill successively, but if the male line failed, could be inherited by her male heirs of the eldest son, the third Marquess. This occurred in April 2013 with the death of Richard Hill, 7th Baron Sandys without male heirs.

Prior to the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, the Marquesses sat in the House of Lords as the Earls of Hillsborough.

Among many other estates, the Marquess owned Hillsborough Castle, the Blessington Estate in County Wicklow, and Easthampstead Park near Bracknell. The Marquesses are also Hereditary Constables of Hillsborough Fort.

The present family seat is Clifton Castle, near Masham, North Yorkshire.

<doc id="435295" wikidata="Q4227301" url="?curid=435295" title="Cocker Spaniel">
<text>Cocker Spaniels are dogs belonging to two breeds of the spaniel dog type: the American Cocker Spaniel and the English Cocker Spaniel, both of which are commonly called simply Cocker Spaniel in their countries of origin. In the early 20th century, Cocker Spaniels also included small hunting spaniels.

Cocker Spaniels were originally bred as hunting dogs in the UK, with the term &quot;cocker&quot; deriving from their use to hunt the Eurasian woodcock. When the breed was brought to the United States, it was bred to a different standard, which enabled it to specialize in hunting the American woodcock. Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during the early part of the 20th century.

Spaniels were first mentioned in the 14th century by Gaston III, Count of Foix in his work the &quot;Livre de Chasse&quot;. The &quot;cocking&quot; or &quot;cocker spaniel&quot; was a type of field or land spaniel in the 19th century. Prior to 1901, Cocker Spaniels were only separated from Field Spaniels and Springer Spaniels by weight. Two dogs are considered to be the foundation sires of both modern breeds, the English variety are descended from Ch. Obo, while the American breed descends from Obo&#x27;s son, Ch. Obo II. In the United States, the English Cocker was recognized as separate from the native breed in 1946; in the UK, the American type was recognized as a separate breed in 1970. In addition, a second strain of English Cocker Spaniel, a working strain, is not bred to a standard, but to working ability. Both breeds share similar coat colors and health issues with a few exceptions.

==History==

While their origins are unknown, &quot;spaynels&quot; are mentioned in 14th-century writings. They are commonly assumed to have originated in Spain, and Edward, 2nd Duke of York in his 15th-century work &quot;The Master of Game&quot; introduces them as &quot;Another kind of hound there is that be called hounds for the hawk and spaniels, for their kind cometh from Spain, notwithstanding that there are many in other countries.&quot; &quot;The Master of Game&quot; was mostly an English translation of an earlier 14th century Old French work by Gaston III of Foix-Béarn entitled &quot;Livre de Chasse&quot;.

In 1801, Sydenham Edwards wrote in &quot;Cynographia Britannica&quot; that the &quot;Land Spaniel&quot; is divided into two types: the hawking, springing/springer and the cocking/cocker spaniel. The term &quot;cocker&quot; came from the dog&#x27;s use in hunting woodcocks. During the 19th century, a &quot;cocker spaniel&quot; was a type of small Field Spaniel; at the time, this term referred to a number of different spaniel hunting breeds, including the Norfolk Spaniel, Sussex Spaniel, and Clumber Spaniel. While no Sussex Cockers or Clumber Cockers existed, some dogs were known as Welsh Cockers and Devonshire Cockers. The Welsh or Devonshire were considered cockers until 1903, when they were recognized by The Kennel Club as the Welsh Springer Spaniel.

Prior to the 1870s, the only requirement for a dog to be classed as a Cocker Spaniel was that it needed to weigh less than , although breeders separated the cocker from the King Charles Spaniel, which remains a smaller breed of spaniel. This maximum weight limit remained on the Cocker Spaniel until 1900, with larger dogs being classed as Springer Spaniels. The colors of the Devonshire and Welsh Cockers were described by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym Stonehenge in his book &quot;The Dog in Health and Disease&quot; as being a deeper shade of liver than that of the Sussex Spaniel. Following the formation of The Kennel Club in the UK in 1873, efforts were made by breeders to record the pedigrees of cockers and springers. In 1892, English Cocker Spaniels and English Springer Spaniels were recognized as separate breeds by The Kennel Club.

Two dogs are thought to be the foundation sires of both modern breeds of cocker spaniels. Ch. Obo is considered by breed enthusiasts to be the father of the modern English Cocker Spaniel, while his son, Ch. Obo II, is considered to be the progenitor of the American Cocker Spaniel. Obo was born in 1879, when registration as a cocker was still only by size and not by ancestry. He was the son of a Sussex Spaniel and a Field Spaniel. Although Obo was an English dog, Obo II was born on American shores – his mother was shipped to the United States while pregnant. During his lifetime, Obo II was claimed in advertisements to be the sire or grandsire of nearly every prize-winning cocker in America.

==Modern breeds==
The two breeds of cocker spaniel are the English Cocker Spaniel and the American Cocker Spaniel. They were bred as gun dogs, to use their sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler to flush birds into the air to be shot, and to use their eyes and nose to locate the bird once downed, and then to retrieve the bird with a soft mouth. The major differences between the English and American varieties is that the American is smaller with a shorter back, a domed head, and a shorter muzzle, while the English variety is taller with a narrower head and chest.

Cocker Spaniel coats occur in a variety of colors, including black, liver, red, and golden in solids. Also, black and tan, and sometimes liver and tan are known, as well as a variety of color mixtures of those solid colors including roans, roan and tans, tricolors, and those solid colors with additional white markings.

Rare colours can appear unexpectedly in certain lines, for instance while an all-white cocker is usually bred by selective breeding of very light golden strains, they can still appear very uncommonly to parents that are dark-colored. A noted occurrence of this happened in 1943, when a grandson of My Own Brucie, Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1940 and 1941, was born all-white.

In its native United States, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked the 23rd-most popular breed according to registration statistics of the AKC in 2009, a decrease in popularity since 1999, when it was ranked 13th. For 25 years, the American Cocker Spaniel was the most popular dog in America. It was ranked number one first in 1936 prior to the English Cocker Spaniel being recognized as a separate breed, and held onto the spot until 1952, when Beagles became the most popular dogs. It regained the spot in 1983 and held on at number one until 1990. In the UK, the American Cocker Spaniel is far less popular than its English relative, with 322 registrations compared to the English Cocker&#x27;s 22,211 in 2009.

===English Cocker Spaniel===

Called simply Cocker Spaniel in the UK, this is the breed that was originally recognized by The Kennel Club (KC) in 1892. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed in 1946.

The size of the English Cocker Spaniel according to the KC is at the withers for males, and for females. The weight of a show dog should be .

The English Cocker Spaniel is the most popular dog breed for showing in the UK, Crufts, with seven best-in-show wins since the prize was first awarded in 1928. This was mostly due to the success of dog breeder H.S. Lloyd&#x27;s Ware Kennel, dogs of which won best-in-show on six occasions between 1930–1950. They are the second most popular dog breed in the UK according to statistics released by the KC with 22,211 registrations in 2009, beaten only by the Labrador Retriever with 40,943. In third place was the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700. The English Cocker&#x27;s popularity has increased steadily since 1999 in the United States when they were ranked 76th in registrations by the AKC, to 2009 when they were ranked 66th.

Physical differences exist between the show strain and working strain in the UK. While the show strain is bred to the conformation standard, the working strain is bred for working ability, and as such, several physical differences have appeared. Working-type dogs tend to be larger with flatter heads and shorter ears. The coat also tends to be shorter and finer than the show variety and have less feathering. The working strain seems to be more energetic than the show strain.

===American Cocker Spaniel===

American Cocker Spaniels were recognized by the AKC in 1878. Generally smaller than the English, separate classes were created for the two types in America in 1935 and the Cocker Spaniel Club of America discouraged breeding between the two types in 1938. The American Cocker Spaniel was recognized as a separate breed by the KC in the UK in 1970. The American Cocker Spaniel is referred to as the Cocker Spaniel within the United States.

The American Cocker Spaniel was bred smaller, as American woodcocks are smaller than their European relatives, and the breed&#x27;s appearance changed slightly during the first part of the 20th century, as the preference by American breeders was for a more stylish appearance. The standard size according to the AKC is between at the withers for males and for females. The weight of the breed is typically between .

At the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the most prestigious dog show in the United States, the American Cocker Spaniel has won Best in Show on four occasions since its first award in 1907. The American Cocker Spaniel is judged in three separate breed classes under AKC rules; &quot;black&quot;, &quot;parti-color&quot;, and &quot;any solid color other than black...&quot; (ASCOB).

<text>Pacoima (Tataviam language: &quot;Pakoinga&quot;, meaning &quot;entrance&quot;) is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. It is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley region of LA.

==Geography==

===Location===
Pacoima is bordered by the Los Angeles districts of Mission Hills on the west, Arleta on the south, Sun Valley on the southeast, Lake View Terrace on the northeast, and by the city of San Fernando on the north.

It covers an area of .

===Landscape===
Ed Meagher of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in 1955 that the 110-block area on the north side of San Fernando Road in Pacoima consisted of what he described as a &quot;smear of sagging, leaning shacks and backhouses framed by disintegrating fences and clutter of tin cans, old lumber, stripped automobiles, bottles, rusted water heaters and other bric-a-brac of the back alleys.&quot; In 1955 Pacoima lacked curbs, paved sidewalks, and paved streets. Pacoima had what Meagher described as &quot;dusty footpaths and rutted dirt roads that in hard rains become beds for angry streams.&quot; Meagher added that the 450 houses in the area, with 2,000 inhabitants, &quot;squatted&quot; &quot;within this clutch of residential blight.&quot; He described most of the houses as &quot;substandard.&quot; Around 1955, the price of residential property increased in value, as lots that sold years prior for $100 sold for $800 in 1955. Between 1950 and 1955, property values on Van Nuys Boulevard increased six times. In late 1952, the Los Angeles City Council allowed the Building and Safety Department to begin a slum clearance project to try to force homeowners who had houses deemed substandard to repair, demolish, or vacate those houses. In early 1955, the city began a $500,000 project to add of curbs, sidewalks, and streets. Meagher said that the &quot;neatness and cleanness&quot; of the new infrastructure were &quot;a challenge to homeowners grown apathetic to thoroughfares ankle deep in mud or dust.&quot; Some area businessmen established the San Fernando Valley Commercial &amp; Savings Bank in November 1953 to finance area rehabilitation projects after other banks persistently refused to give loans to those projects.

In late 1966, a city planning report described the central business district of Pacoima along Van Nuys Boulevard as &quot;a rambling, shallow strip pattern of commercial uses... varying from banks to hamburger stands, including an unusual number of small business and service shops.&quot; A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article stated that the physical image of the area was &quot;somewhat depressing.&quot; The council recommended the establishment of smaller community shopping centers. The article stated that the Pacoima Chamber of Commerce was expected to oppose the recommendation, and that the chamber favored deepening of the existing commercial zones along Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Van Nuys Boulevard. The council noted the lack of parking spaces and storefronts that appeared in disrepair or vacant. The report recommended establishing shopping centers in areas outside of the Laurel Canyon-Van Nuys commercial axis. The article stated that some sections of Laurel Canyon were &quot;in a poor state of repair&quot; and that there were &quot;conspicuously minimal&quot; curbs and sidewalks. The report recommended continued efforts to improve sidewalks and trees. The report advocated the establishment of a community center to &quot;give Pacoima a degree of unity.&quot; Most of the residences in Pacoima were &quot;of an older vintage.&quot; The article said most of the houses and yards, especially in the R-2 duplex zones, exhibited &quot;sign[s] of neglect.&quot; The report said that the range of types of houses was &quot;unusually narrow for a community of this size.&quot; The report also said that the fact had a negative effect on the community that was reflected by a lack of purchasing power. The report added &quot;Substandard home maintenance is widespread and borders on total neglect in some sectors.&quot; The report recommended establishing additional apartments in central Pacoima; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; report said that the recommendation was &quot;clouded&quot; by the presence of &quot;enough apartment-zoned land to last 28 years&quot; in the San Fernando Valley.

In 1994, according to Timothy Williams of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, there were few boarded-up storefronts along Pacoima&#x27;s main commercial strip along Van Nuys Boulevard, and no vacancies existed in Pacoima&#x27;s main shopping center. Williams added that many of the retail outlets in Pacoima consisted of check-cashing outlets, storefront churches, pawn shops, and automobile repair shops. Williams added that the nearest bank to the commercial strip was &quot;several blocks away.&quot; In 1994 almost one third of Pacoima&#x27;s residents lived in public housing complexes. Williams said that the complexes had relatively little graffiti. Many families who were on waiting lists to enter public housing complexes lived in garages and converted tool sheds, which often lacked electricity, heat, and/or running water. Williams said that they lived &quot;out of sight.&quot;

===Climate===
==History==
===Until 1848===

The area was first inhabited by the Fernandeño-Tongva and Tataviam people, California Indian Tribes, now known as Tataviam Band of Mission Indians. The original name for the Native American village in this area was actually &quot;Pakoinga&quot; or &quot;Pakɨynga&quot; in Fernandeño, but since the &quot;ng&quot; sound (a voiced velar nasal) did not exist in Spanish, the Spaniards mistook the sound as an &quot;m&quot; and recorded the name as &quot;Pacoima&quot;, as is seen today.

Pacoima&#x27;s written history dates to 1769 when Spaniards entered the San Fernando Valley. In 1771, nearby Mission San Fernando Rey was founded, with Native Americans creating gardens for the mission in the area. They lived at the mission working on the gardens which, in a few years, had stretched out over most of the valley.

The Mexican government secularized the mission lands in 1834 by taking them away from the church. The first governor of California, Pio Pico, leased the lands to Andrés Pico, his brother. In 1845, Pio Pico sold the whole San Fernando Valley to Don Eulogio de Celis for $14,000 to raise money for the war between Mexico and the United States, settled by a treaty signed at Campo de Cahuenga in 1845, and by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. The Pacoima area became sheep ranches and wheat fields.

===Municipality===

In 1873, Senator Charles Maclay of Santa Clara purchased in the northern part of the San Fernando Valley adjacent to the San Fernando Mission and in 1887, Jouett Allen bought of land between the Pacoima Wash and the Tujunga Wash. The land he purchased was from the Maclay Rancho Water Company, which had taken over Senator Charles Maclay’s holdings in the Valley. Allen retained for himself and subdivided the remainder in tracts. It was from this that the town of Pacoima was born. The subdivision’s original boundaries were Paxton Street on the north, Herrick Avenue on the east, Pierce Street on the south, &amp; San Fernando Road on the west.

The town was built in keeping with the new Southern Pacific railroad station. Shortly after the rail line had been established, the Southern Pacific Railroad chose the site for a large brick passenger station, which was considered to be one of the finest on their line. Soon large spacious and expensive two-story homes made their appearance, as the early planners had established building restrictions against anything of a lesser nature. The first concrete sidewalks and curbs were laid and were to remain the only ones in the San Fernando Valley for many years.
In 1888, the town&#x27;s main street, wide and long, was laid through the center of the subdivision. The street was first named Taylor Avenue after President Taylor; later it was renamed Pershing Street. Today it is known as Van Nuys Boulevard. Building codes were established, requiring that homes built cost at least USD$2,000. The land deed contained a clause that if liquor was sold on this property, it would revert to Jouett Allen or his heirs.
But like the railroad station, the large hotel, the big two-story school building and many commercial buildings, most were torn down within a few years as the boom days receded. The early pioneers had frowned upon industry, which eventually resulted in the people moving away from the exclusive suburb which they had set up to establish new homes closer to their employment and Pacoima returned to its rural, agricultural roots.

In 1916, the presently named Pacoima Chamber of Commerce was established as the Pacoima Chamber of Farmers. For many years, the fertile soil produced abundant crops of olives, peaches, apricots, oranges and lemons. The opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct brought a new supply of water to the area. With the new water supply, the number of orchards, farms and poultry ranches greatly increased and thoroughbred horses began to be raised.

Los Angeles annexed the land, including Pacoima, as part of ordinance 32192 N.S. on May 22, 1915.

=== 1940s: World War II ===

During World War II, the rapid expansion of the workforce at Lockheed&#x27;s main plant in neighboring Burbank and need for worker housing led to the construction of the San Fernando Gardens housing project. By the 1950s, the rapid suburbanization of the San Fernando Valley arrived in Pacoima, and the area changed almost overnight from a dusty farming area to a bedroom community for the fast-growing industries in Los Angeles and nearby Burbank and Glendale, with transportation to and from Pacoima made easy by the Golden State Freeway.

Beginning in the late 1940s, parts of Pacoima started becoming a place where Southern Californians escaping poverty in rural areas settled. In the post–World War II era, many African Americans settled in Pacoima after arriving in the area during the second wave of the Great Migration since they had been excluded from other neighborhoods due to racially discriminatory covenants. By 1960, almost all of the 10,000 African Americans in the San Fernando Valley lived in Pacoima and Arleta as it became the center of African-American life in the Valley.

=== 1957 airplane crashes ===
On January 31, 1957, a Douglas DC-7B operated by Douglas Aircraft Company was involved in a mid-air collision and crashed into the schoolyard of Pacoima Middle School, then named Pacoima Junior High School. By February 1, seven people had died, and about 75 had been injured due to the incident. A 12-year-old boy died from multiple injuries from the incident on February 2. On June 10, 1957, a light aircraft hit a house in Pacoima; the four passengers on board died, and eight people in the house sustained injuries.

=== 1960s to present ===

In 1966, Los Angeles city planners wrote a 48-page report noting that Pacoima does not have a coherent structure to develop businesses in the central business district, lacks civic pride, and has poor house maintenance.

By the late 1960s, immigrants from rural Mexico began to move to Pacoima due to the low housing costs and the neighborhood&#x27;s proximity to manufacturing jobs. African Americans who were better established began to move out and, in an example of ethnic succession, within less than two decades, the African American population was replaced by a poorer Latino immigrant population. Immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador settled in Pacoima. Seventy-five percent of Pacoima&#x27;s residents were African Americans in the 1970s. According to the 1990 U.S. Census, 71% of Pacoima&#x27;s population was of Hispanic/Latino descent while 10% was African American.

The closing of factories in the area around Pacoima in the early 1990s caused residents to lose jobs, reducing the economic base of the neighborhood; many residents left Pacoima as a result. By 1994, Pacoima was the poorest area in the San Fernando Valley. One in three Pacoima residents lived in public housing. The poverty rate hovered between 25% and 40%. In 1994, Williams wrote of Pacoima, &quot;one of the worst off&quot; neighborhoods in Los Angeles &quot;nevertheless hides its poverty well.&quot; Williams cited the lack of homeless people on Pacoima&#x27;s streets, the fact that no vacancies existed in Pacoima&#x27;s major shopping center, and the presence of &quot;neat&quot; houses and &quot;well-tended&quot; yards. Williams added that in Pacoima &quot;holding a job is no guarantee against being poor.&quot; In 1994, Howard Berman, the U.S. Congress representative of an area including Pacoima, and Los Angeles City Council member Richard Alarcon advocated including a in the City of Los Angeles&#x27;s bid for a federal empowerment zone. The proposed area, with 13,000 residents in 1994, included central Pacoima and a southern section of Lake View Terrace.

==Economy==
In the early 1950s to early 1960s, which was the time of the greatest single-family housing construction and population expansion in Pacoima, most residents worked in construction, factory and other blue-collar fields. By 1994 this had changed and many Pacoima residents were then employed at area factories. 
From 1990 to 1994, Lockheed cut over 8,000 jobs at its Burbank, California plant. General Motors closed its Van Nuys plant in 1992, causing the loss of 2,600 jobs. Timothy Williams of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in 1994, &quot;For years, those relatively high-paying jobs had provided families with a springboard out of the San Fernando Gardens and Van Nuys Pierce Park Apartments public housing complexes.&quot; After the jobs were lost, many longtime Pacoima residents left the area. In the 1990 U.S. Census the unemployment rate in Pacoima was almost 14%, while the City of Los Angeles had an overall 8.4% overall unemployment rate. Many Pacoima residents who worked made less than $14,000 annually: the U.S. government&#x27;s poverty line for a family of four. Most residents owned their houses.

Juicy Couture, an apparel company, was founded here in 1996.

In 1955, Ed Meagher of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the &quot;hard-working&quot; low income families of Pacoima were not &quot;indignents or transients&quot;, but they &quot;belong to the community and have a stake in it.&quot; In 1955 P.M. Gomez, the owner of a grocery store in Pacoima, said in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article that most of the homeowners in Pacoima were not interested in moving to the San Fernando Gardens complex that was then under development, since most of the residents wanted to remain homeowners. A 1966 city planning report criticized Pacoima for lacking civic pride, and that the community had no &quot;vital community image, with no apparent nucleus or focal point.&quot;

In 1994, Timothy Williams of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted how Pacoima was &quot;free of the overt blight found in other low-income neighborhoods is no accident.&quot; Cecila Costas, who was the principal of Maclay Middle School during that year, said that Pacoima was &quot;a very poor community, but there&#x27;s a tremendous amount of pride here. You can be poor, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you have to grovel or look like you are poor.&quot; Williams said that the African-American and Hispanic populations of Pacoima did not always have cordial relations. He added that by 1994 &quot;the mood has shifted from conflict to conciliation as the town has become increasingly Latino.&quot;

==Demographics==
The majority of the population is Hispanic.

According to Mapping L.A., Mexican and German were the most common ancestries in 2000. Mexico and El Salvador were the most common foreign places of birth.

===2008===
In 2008, the city estimated that the population was 81,318 with a density of approximately 10,510 people per square mile.

===2010===
The 2010 U.S. census counted 103,689 residents in Pacoima&#x27;s 91331 ZIP Code. The median age was 29.5, and the median yearly household income at that time was $49,842.

==Government and infrastructure==

The United States Postal Service Pacoima Post Office is located on Van Nuys Boulevard.

Politically, Pacoima is represented by Tony Cárdenas in Congress, Caroline Menjivar in the State Senate, and Luz Rivas in the Assembly.

==Transportation==

The major transportation routes across and through the area are San Fernando Road, Van Nuys Boulevard, and Laurel Canyon Boulevard. California State Route 118 (Ronald Reagan) runs through it, and the community is bordered by the I-5 (Golden State).

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) operates bus services in Pacoima. Metro operates Metro Rapid line 761 along Van Nuys Boulevard from Sylmar/San Fernando Station to the Expo/Sepulveda Station. Metro Local Lines 92, 166, 224, 230, 233, 294 and 690 operate in Pacoima. In 2031, Metro will open the East San Fernando Valley Light Rail Transit Project light rail project with three stations at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Van Nuys Boulevard, San Fernando Road and Van Nuys Boulevard, and San Fernando Road &amp; Paxton Street. Whiteman Airport, a general aviation airport owned by the County of Los Angeles, is located in Pacoima.

==Crime==

Crime increased in Pacoima in the 1970s. Timothy Williams of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that an &quot;unprecedented wave of activism&quot; countered the crime surge. Residents led by social institutions such as churches, schools, and social service agencies held marches and rallies. Schools remained open on weekends and in evenings to offer recreational and tutoring programs. Residents circulated petitions to try to stop the establishment of liquor stores. Residents began holding weekly meetings with a gang that, according to Williams, &quot;had long been a neighborhood scourge.&quot; Area police officers said, in Williams&#x27;s words, &quot;although crime in Pacoima remains a major problem&quot;, particularly in the area within the empowerment zone proposed by area politicians in the 1990s, &quot;the situation is far improved from the 1980s.&quot;

Officer Minor Jimenez, who was the senior lead police officer in the Pacoima area in 1994 and had been for a 3½ year period leading up to 1994, said that the community involvement was the main reason for the decrease in crime because the residents cooperated with the police and &quot;the bad guys know it.&quot; After the activism in the area occurred, major crime was reduced by 6%. Residents reached an agreement with liquor store owners; the owners decided to erase graffiti on their properties within 24 hours of reaching the agreement. The owners also stopped the sale of individual cold containers of beer to discourage public consumption of alcohol. Williams said &quot;The activism appears to have paid off.&quot; The resident meetings with Latino gang members resulted in a 143-day consecutive period of no drive by shootings.

==Parks and recreation==
The David M. Gonzales Recreation Center, which originally opened as the Pacoima Recreation Center on June 1, 1950, was rededicated on June 1, 1990. The rededication included a plaque to David M. Gonzales, a soldier in World War II who died in the Battle of Luzon. The center has an auditorium, indoor gymnasium and basketball court. In addition, the center has an outdoor gymnasium with weights, lit baseball diamond, basketball and handball courts and a soccer field. It also features picnic tables, a children&#x27;s play area and a community room.
Gonzales Recreation Center is also used as a stop-in facility by the Los Angeles Police Department.

Originally named Paxton Park, Ritchie Valens Park, Recreation Center and pool are located near the north end of Pacoima. Valens Park has an impressive list of amenities, including an indoor auditorium and gymnasium, both a lit and unlit baseball diamond, indoor basketball courts and outdoor lit basketball courts, children&#x27;s play area, community room, handball courts, kitchen, jogging path, picnic tables, unlit soccer field, a stage, and lit tennis courts. The outdoor pool is seasonal and unheated. In the 1990s Richard Alarcon, a Los Angeles City Council member who represented Pacoima, proposed changing the name of Paxton Park to honor Ritchie Valens. Hugo Martin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said in 1994 that Alarcon proposed the rename so Pacoima residents will &quot;remember Valens&#x27;s humble background and emulate his accomplishments.&quot; The annual Ritchie Valens Fest, a festival, was created in 1994 to honor the renaming of the park.

The Hubert H. Humphrey Memorial Park, public swimming pool, and Recreation Center are located near the northern end of Pacoima. The pool is one of only a few citywide which is a year-round outdoor heated pool. The park has a number of barbecue pits and picnic tables as well as a lit baseball diamond, basketball courts, football field, handball and volleyball courts. Other features include, a children&#x27;s play area, an indoor gymnasium and a center for teenagers which has a kitchen and a stage.

The Hansen Dam Municipal Golf Course, opened in 1962 as an addition to Hansen Dam Recreation Area, is located on the northwest boundary of Pacoima. Although Hansen Dam Recreation Area is actually located in Lake View Terrace, a short distance beyond the true northwest boundary of Pacoima, they have always been associated with Pacoima. The golf course also features a lit driving range, practice chipping and putting greens. There is club and electric or hand cart rental service, a restaurant and snack bar. In 1974 a clubhouse was added.

The Roger Jessup Recreation Center is an unstaffed small park in Pacoima. The park includes barbecue pits, a children&#x27;s play area, a community room, and picnic tables.

==Education==

===Public libraries===
Los Angeles Public Library operates the Pacoima Branch Library in Pacoima.

By 1958, the City of Los Angeles started negotiations to purchase a site to use as the location of a library in Pacoima. The city was scheduled to ask for bids for the construction of the library in May 1960. The library, scheduled to open on August 23, 1961, was a part of a larger $6.4 million library expansion program covering the opening of a total of six libraries in the San Fernando Valley and three other libraries. The previous Pacoima Library, with of space, had around 50,300 books in 2000. In 1978 Pacoima residents protested after the City of Los Angeles decreased library services in Pacoima in the aftermath of the passing of Proposition 13. The Homework Center opened in the library in 1994.

In 1998 Angelica Hurtado-Garcia, then the branch librarian of the Pacoima Branch, said that the community had outgrown the branch and needed a new one. During that year, a committee of the Los Angeles City Council recommended spending $600,000 in federal grant funds to develop plans to build two library branches in the San Fernando Valley, including one in Pacoima. The groundbreaking for the current Pacoima Branch Library, scheduled to have a collection of 58,000 books and videos, was held in 2000. The new library opened in 2002. Hurtado, who was still the senior librarian in 2006, said that the new library, in the words of Alejandro Guzman of the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;, was &quot;more attractive and inviting to the community&quot; than the previous one.

<text>Panorama City is a neighborhood in the city of Los Angeles, California, in the San Fernando Valley. It has a generally young age range as well as the highest population density in the Valley. More than half of the neighborhood&#x27;s population was born abroad, the majority being from Mexico. Known as the Valley&#x27;s first planned community after a transition from agriculture to a post-World War II housing boom, it has been home to several notable residents. It is now a mixture of single-family homes and low-rise apartment buildings.

Panorama City has three high schools, two recreational centers, a senior center, ice rink, two hospitals and a chamber of commerce.

==History==
Panorama City is known as the San Fernando Valley&#x27;s first planned community. In 1948, it was developed as such by residential developer Fritz B. Burns and industrialist Henry J. Kaiser. The master plan was created by architectural firm Wurdeman &amp; Becket. Burns, seeing the tremendous potential fortune that could be made as large numbers of World War II veterans came home and started families, teamed up with Kaiser in 1945 to form Kaiser Community Homes. The vast majority of the houses were bought with loans issued by the Federal Housing Administration or the Servicemen&#x27;s Readjustment Act of 1944, better known as the G.I. Bill.

Homes in the area were sold with racially discriminatory covenants. A &quot;Conditions, Covenants, Restrictions&quot; document filed with the county recorder declared that no Panorama City lot could be &quot;used or occupied by any person whose blood is not entirely that of the white or Caucasian race.&quot; Such restrictive covenants, which sometimes also limited ownership to people &quot;of the Christian faith,&quot; were then common in many communities at the time. Although rendered legally unenforceable by the Civil Rights Act of 1968, most of these documents have not been amended to remove the superfluous language.

&quot;De facto&quot; integration was accelerated by the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The CRA-insured credit was provided to the entire community without regard to race or income, causing white flight as with many other areas of the San Fernando Valley. During the period of desegregation busing, Panorama City was exempted due to its diversity.

Panorama City was once adjacent to General Motors&#x27; largest assembly plant to date. Today, the Van Nuys Assembly plant has been replaced with a large shopping center called The Plant. A mural on both sides of Van Nuys Boulevard, under the rail bridge across from the Van Nuys Station, pays homage to the glory years of the GM plant.

== Geography ==
Panorama City touches Mission Hills on the north, Arleta on the northeast, Sun Valley on the east, Valley Glen on the southeast, Van Nuys on the south and North Hills on the west.

For the most part, the community is a mixture of small single-family homes and low-rise apartment buildings.

==Demographics==

The 2010 U.S. census counted 69,817 residents in the neighborhood’s 91402 ZIP code. The median age was 30.1, and the median yearly household income at that time was USD$41,467.

In 2008, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Mapping L.A. project described Panorama City as an area that was &quot;moderately diverse&quot; ethnically, with a high percentage of Latinos and a significant population of Filipinos. Filipinos and Mexicans were the most common ancestries in the neighborhood. At that time, the breakdown was Latinos, 70.1%; whites, 11.5%; Asians, 11.9%; blacks, 4.3%; and others, 2.2%. Mexico (52.1%) and El Salvador (13.4%) were the most common places of birth for the 55.0% of the residents who were born outside of the United States—a high percentage for Los Angeles.

As of the 2010 census, renters were occupying 64.8% of the housing stock, while owners held 35.2%.

There were 2,849 families headed by single parents. The rate of 20.2% was considered to be a high one. There were 1,837 veterans, or 4.3% of the population, a low percentage compared to the rest of the city and county.

==Parks and recreation==
The Panorama Recreation Center is in the community. The center, which also functions as a Los Angeles Police Department drop-in facility, has an auditorium, a lighted baseball diamond, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children&#x27;s play area, a community room, an indoor gymnasium, picnic tables, and unlit tennis courts.

The Sepulveda Recreation Center is located in Panorama City. The center has two indoor gymnasiums, both of which can be used as auditoriums. The center also has a lighted baseball diamond, lighted indoor basketball courts, a children&#x27;s play area, a community room, and lighted tennis courts. The Sepulveda Pool is an outdoor unheated seasonal pool in the Sepulveda center.

The Mid-Valley Senior Citizen Center is in Panorama City. The center has an auditorium, a kitchen, and a stage. The building was originally a convalescent home. As of July 2000 the former convalescent home was being converted into the senior center.

The LA Kings Valley Ice Center, formerly known as the Valley Skating Center is an ice rink facility located in Panorama City. The facility has two rinks, the &quot;Freeze&quot; rink to the north, and the &quot;Glacier&quot; rink to the south. The facility offers adult and youth ice hockey programs, learn to play programs, learn to skate for hockey and figure skating. The rink also has public stick times, public skating sessions, and freestyle sessions. Either rink is rentable for birthday parties or other events. Broomball is available if a rink is rented. The rink is home to the California Heat amateur hockey club, who compete in the Southern California Amateur Hockey Association (SCAHA), a league of the California Amateur Hockey Association, which is the largest youth league in the western United States.

==Government and infrastructure==

The Panorama City Neighborhood Council is a city agency formed by volunteer elected officials and appointed officials.
The purpose of the Panorama City Neighborhood Council is to provide an inclusive open forum for public discussion, and to serve as an advisory body on issues of concern to the Panorama City area and in the governance of the city of Los Angeles.
The Council gained its official city role upon certification by the Board Of Neighborhood Commissioners on March 15, 2007.

Metro and LADOT operates fixed-route transit bus service in Panorama City. Metro Rapid line 761 operates on Van Nuys Boulevard. Metro Local lines 152, 158, 166, 167, 169, and 233 operate the community. LADOT operates DASH bus service on their Panorama City/Van Nuys route. In 2027, Metro will open the East San Fernando Valley Light Rail Transit Project light rail project with stations on Van Nuys Boulevard at Nordhoff Street and Roscoe Boulevard.

==Economics==
Panorama City was the largest center of major retail outlets in the San Fernando Valley, starting with the opening of what would later become the Panorama Mall in 1955. At the time, this small complex included The Broadway and five other stores. Three other major department stores — Ohrbachs, J. W. Robinson&#x27;s and Montgomery Ward – opened nearby over the next ten years, and they were marketed collectively as the Panorama City Shopping Center. By the 1970s, the area had lost business to nearby communities. The freestanding Ohrbach&#x27;s building, designed by the architectural firm Welton Becket and Associates, is significant in that it represents &quot;an early and important phase of commercial development&quot; in the neighborhood. It is now the site of the Valley Indoor Swap Meet.

The Panorama Mall remains an important local mall, with a Walmart and Curacao discount stores, the latter catering to the Hispanic market.

==Education==

Thirteen percent of Panorama City residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an average percentage for both the city and the county. The percentage of the same-age residents with less than a high school diploma was high for the county.

He joined the staff of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1984.

Kristof is a self-described progressive. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Kristof &quot;rewrote opinion journalism&quot; with his emphasis on human rights abuses and social injustices, such as human trafficking and the Darfur conflict. Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa described Kristof as an &quot;honorary African&quot; for shining a spotlight on neglected conflicts in the continent.

==Early life and education==
Kristof was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up on a family sheep farm and cherry orchard in Yamhill, Oregon. He is the son of Jane Kristof (&quot;née&quot; McWilliams) and Ladis &quot;Kris&quot; Kristof (born Władysław Krzysztofowicz; 1918-2010), both long-time professors at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. His father, who was born to Polish and Armenian parents in Chernivtsi, former Austria-Hungary, immigrated to the United States after World War II. Kristof graduated from Yamhill Carlton High School, where he was student body president and school newspaper editor. He attended Harvard College, where he was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate. At Harvard, he studied government, interned at Portland&#x27;s &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, and worked on &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; newspaper. According to a profile of him, &quot;Alums recall Kristof as one of the brightest undergraduates on campus.&quot;

After Harvard, he studied law at Magdalen College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar. He earned his law degree with first-class honors and won an academic prize (awarded as an earned Bachelor of Arts at Oxford, and promoted per tradition to a Master of Arts). He studied Arabic in Egypt for the 1983–84 academic year at the American University in Cairo. He has a number of honorary degrees.

== Career ==
After joining &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1984, initially covering economics, Kristof worked as a correspondent for the company in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Tokyo. He rose to be associate managing editor of &quot;The New York Times,&quot; responsible for Sunday editions. His columns have often focused on global health, poverty, and gender issues in the developing world. In particular, since 2004 he has written dozens of columns about Darfur and visited the area 11 times.

Kristof&#x27;s biography says he has traveled to more than 150 countries. Jeffrey Toobin of CNN and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, a Harvard classmate, has said: &quot;I&#x27;m not surprised to see him emerge as the moral conscience of our generation of journalists. I am surprised to see him as the Indiana Jones of our generation of journalists.&quot;

Bill Clinton said of Kristof in September 2009: 
&quot;There is no one in journalism, anywhere in the United States at least, who has done anything like the work he has done to figure out how poor people are actually living around the world, and what their potential is. So every American citizen who cares about this should be profoundly grateful that someone in our press establishment cares enough about this to haul himself all around the world to figure out what&#x27;s going on. ... I am personally in his debt, as are we all.&quot;

Kristof was a member of the board of overseers of Harvard University, where he was chief marshal of commencement for his 25th reunion. He is a member of the board of trustees of the Association of American Rhodes Scholars. Joyce Barnathan, president of the International Center for Journalists, said in a 2013 statement: &quot;Nick Kristof is the conscience of international journalism.&quot;

In 2020, Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation described Kristof as &quot;journalism&#x27;s North Star on issues of poverty, dignity and justice.&quot;

Between 2010 and 2018 Kristof wrote three articles about Kevin Cooper, a man who had been sentenced to death for murdering a family in California. In these articles Kristof made the case that Cooper had been framed by a racist Sheriff&#x27;s department and that the true killer was a white contract killer named Lee Furrow. After the third article, both U.S. Senators from California, Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein, called for a second round of DNA testing to clarify whether Cooper had been framed. Seven months after the article was published, departing Governor Jerry Brown authorized limited retesting to settle the issue; the testing was ultimately inconclusive and while an independent investigation would conclude that Cooper was guilty, questions have been raised about the impartiality and effectiveness of the investigation.

On November 12, 2016, Kristof made national headlines after he chased and tackled an intruder whom he discovered burglarizing his room at the Franklin Hotel near Independence Hall in Philadelphia. In a blog post titled &quot;Why You Should Always Lock Your Hotel Room Door,&quot; published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; later that day, Kristof wrote that the thief threatened multiple times to stab him during the chase and was restrained in the lobby with the help of several hotel employees.

===Oregon gubernatorial campaign===
In July 2021, survey research was conducted that appeared to be directed toward recruiting him or testing his potential appeal, as a candidate for governor of Oregon in 2022, as incumbent Kate Brown was term-limited. In October 2021, Kristof left &quot;The New York Times&quot; after forming a political action committee for his potential candidacy, saying in a statement, 
&quot;Precisely because I have a great job, outstanding editors and the best readers, I may be an idiot to leave. But you all know how much I love Oregon, and how much I&#x27;ve been seared by the suffering of old friends there. So I&#x27;ve reluctantly concluded that I should try not only to expose problems but also see if I can fix them directly.&quot;

In a Twitter thread about Kristof&#x27;s announcement, &quot;New York Times&quot; Features Editor Hillary Howard wrote, &quot;Nick had a remarkable talent for never taking anything personally, for never letting his ego get in the way. At a place as competitive as the Times, this trait really stood out. He somehow seemed like this innocent, unchanged after dining with warlords or interviewing pimps. This trait will serve him well, should he go into politics.&quot; Other colleagues described Kristof as a mentor to young journalists.

On October 27, 2021, Kristof officially announced he would run for governor as a Democrat. A day later, on October 28, 2021, the &quot;Times&quot; published an essay by Kristof in which he wrote, 
&quot;I love journalism, but I also love my home state. I keep thinking of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s dictum: &#x27;It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,&#x27; he said. &#x27;The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena.&#x27;&quot;

On January 6, 2022, Shemia Fagan, the Oregon Secretary of State, announced that Kristof was ineligible to run as he was judged not to have met the state&#x27;s residency requirements. Kristof challenged the decision in court and on February 17, the Oregon Supreme Court upheld the Secretary of State&#x27;s ruling.

On August 1, 2022, Kristof and &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced that he would be returning to his job as a columnist for the newspaper. His first new column since returning to the paper was published on November 16, 2022.

==Prizes==
In 1990, Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, won a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for their reporting on the pro-democracy student movement and the related Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. They were the first married couple to win a Pulitzer for journalism. Kristof has also received the George Polk Award and an award from the Overseas Press Club for his reporting which focuses on human rights and environmental issues.

Kristof was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 2004 and again in 2005 &quot;for his powerful columns that portrayed suffering among the developing world&#x27;s often forgotten people and stirred action.&quot; In 2006 Kristof won his second Pulitzer, the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary &quot;for his graphic, deeply reported columns that, at personal risk, focused attention on genocide in Darfur and that gave voice to the voiceless in other parts of the world.&quot; Kristof was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize again in 2012 and 2016; altogether, he has been a Pulitzer finalist seven times.

In 2008, Kristof received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2009, Kristof and WuDunn received the Dayton Literary Peace Prize&#x27;s 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award. Together, they also received the 2009 World of Children Lifetime Achievement Award. He has also won the 2008 Anne Frank Award, the 2007 Fred Cuny Award for Prevention of Deadly Conflict, and the 2013 Advancing Global Health Award (from Seattle Biomed). Commentators have occasionally suggested Kristof for the Nobel Peace Prize, but when Media Web named Kristof its &quot;print journalist of the year&quot; in 2006 and asked him about that, it quoted him as saying: &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine it going to a scribbler like me. That&#x27;s a total flight of fancy.&quot;

In 2011, Kristof was named one of seven &quot;Top American Leaders&quot; by the Harvard Kennedy School and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. &quot;His writing has reshaped the field of opinion journalism,&quot; The Washington Post explained in granting the award. That same year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. Earlier, in 2007, U.S. News &amp; World Report named Kristof one of &quot;America&#x27;s Best Leaders.&quot;

In 2013, Kristof was awarded the Goldsmith Award for Career Excellence in Journalism by Harvard University. Alex Jones, the Pulitzer Prize-winning director of Harvard Kennedy School of Government&#x27;s Shorenstein Center, declared in presenting the award that &quot;the reporter who&#x27;s done more than any other to change the world is Nick Kristof.&quot; In the same year, Kristof was named an International Freedom Conductor by the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, largely for his work exposing human trafficking and linking it to modern slavery. The last person named to receive the title, two years earlier, was the Dalai Lama.

In 2021, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded Kristof and &quot;The New York Times&quot; opinion video team an Emmy award for their video, &quot;Heartache in the Hot Zone: The Front Line Against Covid-19.&quot;

==Books==

Kristof has co-authored all his books with his wife WuDunn, include &quot;China Wakes: The Struggle for the Soul of a Rising Power&quot; (1994), &quot;Thunder from the East: Portrait of a Rising Asia&quot; (1999), &quot;Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide&quot; (Knopf, September 2009), &quot;A Path Appears: Transforming Lives, Creating Opportunity&quot; (2014) and &quot;Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope&quot; (Knopf, January 2020). A feature documentary for &quot;Tightrope&quot; was released in 2019. These were all bestsellers.

Kristof explained to Jane Wales of the World Affairs Council of Northern California that the idea for their book &quot;Half the Sky&quot; was sparked by the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. After covering the protests, which resulted in some 500 deaths, Kristof and WuDunn were shocked to learn that roughly 39,000 Chinese girls died each year because they were not given the same access to food and medical care as boys. WuDunn and Kristof did not find coverage of these deaths, although they were far more numerous than the casualties at Tiananmen Square. They decided to dig deeper into questions of gender, Kristof said. &quot;Half the Sky&quot; covers topics such as sex trafficking and forced prostitution, contemporary slavery, gender-based violence, and rape as a weapon of war and method of justice, as it highlights the multitude of ways women are oppressed and violated in the world.

&quot;Half the Sky&quot; reached No. 1 on the best-seller lists. Carolyn See, an author and book critic of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, said in her review: 
&quot;&quot;Half the Sky&quot; is a call to arms, a call for help, a call for contributions, but also a call for volunteers. It asks us to open our eyes to this enormous humanitarian issue. It does so with exquisitely crafted prose and sensationally interesting material. ... I really do think this is one of the most important books I have ever reviewed.&quot;

In Cleveland, a reviewer for &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; said: &quot;As Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring&quot; once catalyzed us to save our birds and be better stewards of our earth, &#x27;Half the Sky&#x27; stands to become a classic, spurring us to spare impoverished women these terrors, and elevate them to turn around the future of their nations.&quot; &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; review predicted that &quot;Half the Sky&quot; may &quot;ignite a grass-roots revolution like the one that eliminated slavery&quot;.

==Opinion and stances==
===Iraq War===
Kristof was opposed to the Iraq War and grew further opposed as time went on. In a column published on January 28, 2003, he summarized his position by writing, &quot;If we were confident that we could oust Saddam with minimal casualties and quickly establish a democratic Iraq, then that would be fine -- and such a happy scenario is conceivable. But it&#x27;s a mistake to invade countries based on best-case scenarios.&quot; He continued, &quot;Frankly, it seems a bad idea to sacrifice our troops&#x27; lives -- along with billions of dollars -- in a way that may add to our vulnerability.&quot;

Kristof was criticized at the time for reporting that Iraqis opposed an American invasion. Andrew Sullivan was among Kristof&#x27;s critics but in 2018, on the 15th anniversary of the war, apologized to Kristof in a tweet.

In a column published on August 27, 2002, &quot;Wimps on Iraq,&quot; he wrote &quot;To us the existing Iraq debate seems largely beside the point; the real issue isn&#x27;t whether we want to overthrow Saddam, but what price we would have to pay to get the job done.&quot; He concludes, after detailing five practical concerns about invading Iraq, &quot;So if Mr. Bush were really addressing these concerns, weighing them and then concluding that on balance it&#x27;s worth an invasion, I&#x27;d be reassured. But instead it looks as if the president, intoxicated by moral clarity, has decided that whatever the cost, whatever the risks, he will invade Iraq.&quot; In the same column, he wrote, &quot;President Bush has convinced me that there is no philosophical reason we should not overthrow the Iraqi government, given that Iraqis themselves would be better off, along with the rest of the world. But Mr. Bush has not overcome some practical concerns about an invasion.&quot;

In the column &quot;The Day After&quot; in September 2002, Kristof wrote, &quot;In one Shiite city after another, expect battles between rebels and army units, periodic calls for an Iranian-style theocracy, and perhaps a drift toward civil war. For the last few days, I&#x27;ve been traveling in these Shiite cities—Karbala, Najaf and Basra—and the tension in the bazaars is thicker than the dust behind the donkey carts. So before we rush into Iraq, we need to think through what we will do the morning after Saddam is toppled. Do we send in troops to try to seize the mortars and machine guns from the warring factions? Or do we run from civil war, and risk letting Iran cultivate its own puppet regime?&quot;

On May 6, 2003, less than two months into the war, Kristof published the op-ed column &quot;Missing in Action: Truth&quot; in which he questioned whether the intelligence gathered by the Bush administration, which purportedly indicated that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, was either faked or manipulated. In this article, Kristof cited as his source a &quot;former ambassador&quot; who had traveled to Niger in early 2002 and reported to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the State Department that the uranium &quot;allegations were unequivocally wrong and based on forged documents&quot;. Kristof added, &quot;The envoy&#x27;s debunking of the forgery was passed around the administration and seemed to be accepted—except that President Bush and the State Department kept citing it anyway.&quot;

Two months later, former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV came forward publicly and published a now-famous op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;What I Didn&#x27;t Find in Africa.&quot; This set off a series of events which resulted in what become known as &quot;Plamegate,&quot; the disclosure by the journalist Robert Novak of the until-then covert status as a CIA officer of Wilson&#x27;s wife, Valerie Plame Wilson. A criminal investigation was launched as to the source of the leak, as a consequence of which I. Lewis (&quot;Scooter&quot;) Libby, then-Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was indicted on obstruction of justice, false statement, and perjury charges and subsequently convicted and sentenced to 30 months in federal prison and a $250,000 fine though he never served time in prison because President Bush commuted his prison sentence. Kristof&#x27;s May 6 article was mentioned in the federal indictment of Libby as a key point in time and a contributing factor that caused Libby to inquire about the identity of the &quot;envoy&quot; and later to divulge the secret identity of his wife to reporters.

===&quot;Grand bargain&quot; with Iran===
Kristof published several articles criticizing the missed opportunity of the &quot;grand bargain&quot;, a proposal by Iran to normalize relations with the United States, implement procedures to assure the US it will not develop nuclear weapons, deny any monetary support to Palestinian resistance groups until they agree to stop targeting civilians, support the Arab Peace Initiative, and ensure full transparency to assuage any US concerns. In return, the Iranians demanded abolition of sanctions and a US statement that Iran does not belong in the so-called &quot;Axis of Evil.&quot; In his columns, Kristof revealed the documents detailing the &quot;grand bargain&quot; proposal and argued that it was killed by hardliners in the Bush administration.

According to Kristof, that was an &quot;appalling mistake&quot; since &quot;the Iranian proposal was promising and certainly should have been followed up. It seems diplomatic mismanagement of the highest order for the Bush administration to have rejected that process out of hand, and now to be instead beating the drums of war and considering air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.&quot; Kristof further believes that even if the grand bargain is not currently feasible, there is still an option for what he calls a &quot;mini-bargain&quot;, a more modest proposal for normalizing American-Iranian relations.

===Anthrax attacks columns===
On October 12, 2001, &quot;Times&quot; reporter Judith Miller became one of several victims of alleged anthrax attacks. The book &quot;&quot;, which Miller had co-written with two other &quot;Times&quot; staffers, had been published ten days earlier on October 2. It became a top &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller a few weeks later. Its cover art depicted a white envelope like those used in the anthrax incidents. The text, written before the September 11 attacks, made reference to jihadist terrorists.

In 2002, Kristof wrote a series of columns indirectly suggesting that Steven Hatfill, a former U.S. Army germ-warfare researcher named as a &quot;person of interest&quot; by the FBI might be a &quot;likely culprit&quot; in the anthrax attacks. Hatfill was never charged with any crime. In July 2004, Hatfill sued the &quot;Times&quot; and Kristof for libel, claiming defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Subsequently, Hatfill voluntarily dismissed Kristof as a defendant in the case when it became clear that the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, lacked personal jurisdiction over Kristof. The suit continued against the &quot;Times&quot; itself but was dismissed in 2004 on the basis that allegations within Kristof&#x27;s articles did not constitute defamation though they appeared untrue.

The appeals court reversed the lower court ruling in 2005, reinstating Hatfill&#x27;s suit against the &quot;Times.&quot; In January 2007, Presiding Judge Claude M. Hilton again dismissed the suit and ruled that Kristof&#x27;s anthrax articles were &quot;cautiously worded&quot; and asserted that the scientist may perhaps be innocent. Judge Hilton wrote that Kristof &quot;made efforts to avoid implicating his guilt&quot; and that &quot;Mr. Kristof reminded readers to assume plaintiff&#x27;s innocence.&quot; Kristof praised the dismissal of the suit, commenting that he was &quot;really pleased that the judge recognized the importance of this kind of reporting&quot; and that it was &quot;terrific to have a judgment that protects journalism at a time when the press has had a fair number of rulings against it&quot;. After the case was dismissed in 2007, the dismissal was upheld by the Appeals Court. In 2008, the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to grant certiorari in the case and effectively left the Appeals Court decision in place. The basis for the dismissal was that Hatfill was a &quot;public figure&quot; and had not proved malice on the part of the &quot;Times&quot;.

===Sudan and Darfur===
Kristof is particularly well known for his reporting on Sudan. At the beginning of 2004, he was among the first reporters to visit Darfur and describe &quot;the most vicious ethnic cleansing you&#x27;ve never heard of.&quot; He recounted what he called &quot;a campaign of murder, rape and pillage by Sudan&quot; and was among the first to call it genocide. His biography says that he has made 11 trips to the region, some illegally by sneaking in from Chad, and on at least one occasion, he was detained at a checkpoint when the authorities seized his interpreter and Kristof refused to leave him behind.

Kristof&#x27;s reporting from Sudan has been both praised and criticized. Robert DeVecchi, past president of the International Rescue Committee, told the Council on Foreign Relations: &quot;Nicholas Kristof... had an unprecedented impact in single-handedly mobilizing world attention to this crisis. There are undoubtedly hundreds of thousands of refugees in and from the Darfur region who owe their very lives to this formidable humanitarian and journalist.&quot; New York Magazine said that Kristof &quot;single-handedly focused the world&#x27;s attention on Darfur,&quot; and the Save Darfur Coalition said that &quot;he is the person most responsible for getting this issue into America&#x27;s consciousness and the resulting efforts to resolve it.&quot; Samantha Power, the author of &quot;A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide&quot;, the Pulitzer Prize-winning book on genocide, told an American Jewish World Service audience that Kristof was probably the person the Janjaweed militia in Darfur most wanted to kill. In June 2008, the actress Mia Farrow spoke as Kristof was honored with the Anne Frank Award by declaring: &quot;Nick Kristof was one of the first to publicly insist that the words Never Again mean something for the people of Darfur. For his courage and his conviction in telling tell searing truths, he is the voice of our collective conscience, demanding we bear witness to the first genocide of the 21st century and encouraging us not to sit by while innocents die. Every once in a great while a moral giant appears among us. Nicholas Kristof is that person.&quot; For his coverage of Darfur, Ann Curry of NBC suggested that Kristof was &quot;the modern journalist who showed courage and leadership comparable to the great Edward R. Murrow.&quot;

On the other hand, some commentators have criticized Kristof for focusing on atrocities by Arab militias in Darfur and downplaying atrocities by non-Arab militias. A book by Mahmood Mamdani of Columbia University, &quot;Saviors and Survivors,&quot; criticized Kristof&#x27;s reporting for oversimplifying a complex historically-rooted conflict and packaging it as &quot;genocide&quot;. Others, including some critical of Sudan, have sometimes made similar arguments. The Sudanese government has also objected that Kristof&#x27;s reporting exaggerates the scale of suffering and ignores the nuances of tribal conflicts in Darfur. The Sudan government and pro-government news media criticized him in March 2012 for sneaking into Sudan&#x27;s Nuba Mountains region without a visa to report on hunger and bombings there by saying that his illegal entry was &quot;shameful and improper&quot;.

===Criticism of anti-sweatshop movement===
Nicholas Kristof argues that sweatshops are, if not a good thing, defensible as a way for workers to improve their lives and for impoverished countries to transform themselves into industrial economies. In his argument, sweatshops are an unpleasant but necessary stage in industrial development. Kristof is critical of the way &quot;well-meaning American university students regularly campaign against sweatshops&quot;, particularly the anti-sweatshop movement&#x27;s strategy of encouraging consumer boycotts against sweatshop-produced imports. Kristof and WuDunn counter that the sweatshop model is a primary reason that Taiwan and South Korea, which accepted sweatshops as the price of development, are today modern countries with low rates of infant mortality and high levels of education, but India, which has generally resisted sweatshops, suffers from a high rate of infant mortality. Kristof and WuDunn admit that sweatshop labor is grueling and dangerous but argue that it is an improvement over most alternatives in extremely poor countries by providing much-needed jobs and boosting economies. They caution that anti-sweatshop boycott campaigns could lead to the closing down of manufacturing and processing plants in places like Africa, where they are needed most. &quot;This is not to praise sweatshops,&quot; they admit:

Some managers are brutal in the way they house workers in firetraps, expose children to dangerous chemicals, deny bathroom breaks, demand sexual favors, force people to work double shifts or dismiss anyone who tries to organize a union. Agitation for improved safety conditions can be helpful, just as it was in 19th-century Europe. But Asian workers would be aghast at the idea of American consumers boycotting certain toys or clothing in protest. The simplest way to help the poorest Asians would be to buy more from sweatshops, not less.

=== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===
Kristof supports Israeli and US negotiation with Hamas as a means to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He criticizes Israel for what he views as collective punishment of Gazans and holds that the lack of negotiations only strengthens extremists. He also advocates removing Israeli settlements from Hebron since &quot;the financial cost is mind-boggling, and the diplomatic cost is greater&quot;. Kristof contrasts &quot;two Israels&quot;: an oppressive security state in the Palestinian territories and a &quot;paragon of justice, decency, fairness – and peace,&quot; in the work of Israeli human rights activists, journalists, and jurists.

=== Libya ===
During the 2011 Libyan civil war, Kristof remarked that the US should create a no-fly zone and also use military aircraft to jam Libyan state communications: &quot;let&#x27;s remember the risks of inaction – and not psych ourselves out. For crying out loud!&quot;

=== US government ===
In a column published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on June 15, 2011, Kristof argued that the US military was a prime example of how a comprehensive social safety net, universal health care, a commitment to public service, low income disparity, and structured planning could be made to work within an organization. He then suggested that the military could serve as a model for improving American society along those lines. This brought criticism from several other commentators, who argued that the military is effective at what it does only by severely limiting the freedom of its members. Jonah Goldberg argued, &quot;You&#x27;ve got to love how a system that requires total loyalty, curbs free speech, free association, freedom of movement, etc., is now either &#x27;lefty&#x27; or &#x27;liberal&#x27; because it gives &#x27;free&#x27; healthcare and daycare,&quot; and he hinted that the ideas in Kristof&#x27;s column resembled fascism. David French added, &quot;If you want to see the military do what it does best, then ride out on a mission with an armored cavalry squadron. If you want to see the military struggle to do its job well, then I suggest you spend some time with its social services.&quot;

=== Education reform ===
In a 2021 &quot;New York Times&quot; essay, Kristof wrote that he favors education reform more than teachers&#x27; unions do. He wishes that unions would push more for higher pay and less for job security for weak teachers. He suggests that unions sometimes encourage teachers to accept low wages in return for job security. Instead, Kristof advocates that teachers give up some protections in exchange for receiving much higher average starting salaries. He says that despite his disagreements with unions on some issues, &quot;I roll my eyes&quot; at what he calls a conservative narrative that unions are the fundamental problem in K-12 education. States with the best schools, like Massachusetts, have strong teachers&#x27; unions, while those with the worst education outcomes, like South Carolina, have weak or non-existent unions, he wrote.

===Flame retardants and chemical reform===
Kristof has written several articles on the controversial use of flame retardants in furniture, most recently in the November 2013 piece &quot;Danger Lurks in that Mickey Mouse Couch.&quot; Kristof argues that legislative mandates of flame retardants in furniture are a result of powerfully-influential lobbyists representing the chemical industry. He claims that flame retardants are ineffective in saving lives but pose an increasingly evident public health risk to both families and firefighters. In his words, &quot;These flame retardants represent a dizzying corporate scandal. It&#x27;s a story of corporate greed, deceit and skulduggery.&quot;

In 2012, Kristof went as far as to write that flame retardants in furniture are &quot;a case study of everything that is wrong with money politics&quot;. He concluded the article &quot;Are You Safe On That Sofa?&quot; by arguing that the United States needs not only safer couches but also a political system less distorted by what he calls &quot;toxic money&quot;.

Kristof&#x27;s stances on flame retardants have come under fire from the chemical industry, which calls his opeds &quot;overdramatic&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot;.

===Child pornography and nonconsensual pornography===
On December 4, 2020, Kristof published a lengthy look at the website Pornhub and at its parent company, MindGeek. Kristof examined how Pornhub routinely has pornographic content on its site involving minors, and he wrote about how Pornhub&#x27;s reviewers often have to make judgment calls on whether the user-submitted pornographic videos feature underage performers and whether the videos depict individuals engaging in nonconsensual sex. Kristof&#x27;s article included interviews with underage victims who have appeared in videos on Pornhub that were submitted by people who filmed them, in some cases while being raped, and he reported that several such victims had attempted suicide. Pornhub denied Kristof&#x27;s claims by calling them &quot;irresponsible and flagrantly untrue&quot;. Kristof implored political leaders in Canada, where MindGeek is based, to consider why Canada hosts a website that profits off videos featuring rape and children. In response, on December 4 Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters outside his residence: &quot;We are always extremely concerned with gender-based violence, with exploitation of minors, with child pornography.&quot;

After MasterCard, Visa, and Discover banned payments to MindGeek-owned sites based on Kristof&#x27;s report, several commentators argued that Kristof&#x27;s solution impacted the many legal consensual sex workers who rely on MindGeek sites for income. Sex Workers Outreach Project USA provided a statement on December 11, 2020 that asserted that &quot;the damage they do does not impact the labor as much as it affects the laborers who depend on the Pornhub platform to earn a living. Because of this decision, based on fiction and conflated reports regarding the presence of minors being assaulted on its platform, many sex workers will be forced even further into the margins.&quot; Sarah T. Roberts described the campaign targeting Pornhub as &quot;strangely punitive and uniquely puritanical in an American way.&quot;

In a follow-up article on April 16, 2021, &quot;Why Do We Let Corporations Profit From Rape Videos,&quot; Kristof provided an update and shared the story of a woman in Alberta who had been drugged and raped by her ex-husband, who later posted a video of the assault on Pornhub. The video was viewed by more than 200,000 people, and in her interview with Kristof, the woman shared she had attempted suicide. &quot;How do you get your head around 200,000 guys masturbating as you&#x27;re being assaulted?&quot; she said.

Kristof also addressed some of the concerns raised by pro-sex work activists that he was anti-pornography. He remarked that &quot;a starting point is to recognize that the issue is not pornography but child abuse and exploitation. We can be sex positive and exploitation negative.&quot;

===Political party===
Kristof is a self-described progressive and a registered member of the Democratic Party. In 1974, a front-page article in the &quot;News-Register (McMinnville, Oregon)&quot; reported on Kristof&#x27;s activism in Democratic politics throughout high school with the headline &quot;Nicholas Gets into Politics Early.&quot; He has attributed many of his progressive views to his mother, Jane Kristof, who formerly served as treasurer of the Yamhill County Democratic Central Committee and currently serves as both her precinct committee-person and the coordinator of the Yamhill County Democratic Think Tank. In 2011, President Barack Obama hosted Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, at the State Dinner for Hu Jintao.

==Win-a-Trip with Nick Kristof contest==
In 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; launched the Win a Trip with Nick Kristof contest, offering a college student the opportunity to win a reporting trip to Africa with Kristof by submitting essays outlining what they intend to accomplish in such a trip. From among 3,800 students who submitted entries, Kristof chose Casey Parks of Jackson, Mississippi. In September 2006, Kristof and Parks traveled to Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic and reported on AIDS, poverty, and maternal mortality. During the trip, Kristof published his &quot;New York Times&quot; columns while Parks wrote about her observations in her blog.

The success of this partnership prompted the &quot;Times&quot; to hold the Second Annual Win A Trip with Nick Kristof contest in 2007. Leana Wen, a medical student at Washington University in St. Louis, and Will Okun, a teacher at Westside Alternative High School in Chicago, were the winners of the 2007 competition. During summer 2007, they traveled with Kristof to Rwanda, Burundi, and eastern Congo. Filmmaker Eric Daniel Metzgar joined Kristof, Wen and Okun on their trip. The resulting film, &quot;Reporter,&quot; premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and aired on HBO in February 2010. In reviewing the film, which was executive produced by Ben Affleck, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;In &quot;Reporter&quot;, he&#x27;s a compelling figure, a cross between Mother Teresa and the James Woods character in &quot;Salvador&quot;, and what seals the intensity of his job is the danger.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; observed, &quot;Ideally, [Kristof] hopes to teach his companions, who won a contest to travel with him, about the value of witnessing the world&#x27;s atrocities and scintillating them into stories that will call on people to act. Which is what Kristof did with his work in Darfur, Sudan: He caused people – from George Clooney on down – to do whatever they can.&quot;

Since 2010, the Center for Global Development has screened applicants for the contest, forwarding Kristof a short list of finalists for his selection.
In March 2018 Kristof traveled again to the Central African Republic accompanied by Tyler Pager, the former editor of &quot;The Daily Northwestern&quot; and the winner of that year&#x27;s contest. The co-director of Columbia University&#x27;s Human Rights Institute, Sarah Knuckey, described Kristof&#x27;s reporting of the Central African Republic resulting from this trip as &quot;shallow&quot; and &quot;reckless&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Kristof married Sheryl WuDunn, a third-generation Chinese American, in 1988. They have three children. In 2018, Kristof and his wife began converting his family&#x27;s cherry orchard in Yamhill, Oregon, to a cider apple orchard and vineyard.

In 2020, Westchester Magazine described Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, as &quot;Scarsdale residents.&quot; In 2022, Kristof told the Willamette Week that &quot;[t]he plan is to continue to base myself on the farm here in Yamhill, but spend a week every month or two in New York,&quot; as part of his obligations as a columnist for The New York Times.

== Controversies ==

Kristof has faced significant criticism for his journalistic practices and viewpoints, particularly regarding his coverage of women and children in vulnerable situations, racism, as well as his approach to activism. Critics have accused him of oversimplifying complex issues, playing into the &quot;white savior&quot; narrative, and overlooking the systemic factors that contribute to social problems, such as gender-based violence and exploitation.

Kristof&#x27;s critics have accused him of promoting a &quot;white knight&quot; or &quot;white savior&quot; complex, where his journalism and activism are framed in a way that centers Western interventions as the solution to global problems, rather than empowering local communities to address their own issues. This approach, some argue, reinforces harmful stereotypes and undermines the agency of those Kristof aims to represent.

Additionally, his coverage of the Central African Republic and other international crises has attracted significant backlash for its portrayal of victims in a way that some view as dehumanizing or sensationalized. Critics argue that his stories, while drawing attention to important issues, often fail to capture the complexity of the local context and the nuances of ongoing conflicts, leaving out key perspectives.

Further controversy arose when Kristof&#x27;s name was linked to advocacy efforts that some sex-work abolitionist groups, such as those that campaigned against Pornhub, have endorsed. Critics within the sex-work community, including some human rights advocates, argue that Kristof&#x27;s stance on such issues often reflects a misunderstanding of the complexities of sex work and contributes to harmful legal and social policies.

Kristof has also been criticised for many cases of orientalism and anti-Asian racism, particularly anti-Japanese racism, and also for things such as trying to defend the &quot;model minority&quot; myth of Asian-Americans.

===Anti-Japanese Racism===

Kristof has also been accused of anti-Japanese racism many times due to articles he penned being seen as biased, offensive or racist against Japan and Japanese people. Shortly after the 1995 Okinawa rape incident he penned an article claiming that comics for Japanese women celebrate rape which was seen as a form of victim blaming, and also wrote many other articles exaggerating Japanese people as strange, foreign &quot;others&quot; who cannot be understood by western people, containing many details which were easily refuted or seen as egregiously wrong by Japanese people.

In 1998, a group of seven Japanese residents of New York, mainly women, were so disturbed by Kristof&#x27;s articles that they published a book covering and refuting several of them. They also hosted a panel discussion about the US media&#x27;s coverage of Japan which included left-wing scholar Chizuko Ueno, who sharply criticized the U.S. media, referring mainly to the New York Times and its articles by Kristof, for &quot;making up a fake Japan&quot;. Hideko Otake, the editor of the book, also criticized the articles in an interview, stating, &quot;All of these articles show Japan through tinted glasses. They refuse to show the whole picture, presenting only sporadic reports that are sensational and contrived, which builds up to form the perception that Japan is a strange country, fostering stereotypes.&quot; Otake also wrote a column for the Japan Quarterly describing the New York Times articles as &quot;stereotypical and distorted images of Japan&quot; created by the US media.

Kristof has also not only tried to justify the atomic bombings of Japan, but made the false claim that Japanese people see the bombings as justified as well.

Kristof has also been accused of taking an anti-Japanese stance in articles on international relations such as on the Senkaku Islands penning many biased articles filled with falsehoods, to the point that the Japanese Consulate General in New York protested multiple times, the problem was discussed in the House of Councillors, and Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a rebuttal on factually wrong statements on one of the articles.

<text>Sun Valley is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California in the San Fernando Valley region. The neighborhood is known for its younger population. There are three recreation centers in Sun Valley, one of which is a historic site. The neighborhood has thirteen public schools—including John H. Francis Polytechnic High School and Valley Oaks Center for Enriched Studies (VOCES)—and four private schools.

==History==

The former Tongva/Fernandeño (Native American) village in this area was called &quot;Wixánga,&quot; which comes from the word &quot;wixár&quot; (or &quot;thorn&quot; or &quot;prickle&quot; in English) in the Fernandeño dialect of the Tongva language. Hence, &quot;Wixánga&quot; meant something like &quot;place/canyon of the thorns&quot; in English, in reference to the abundant prickly pear cacti naturally found in the area. This was later reflected in the Spanish name for the area, or &quot;Cañada de las Tunas&quot; (&quot;canyon of the thorns&quot; in English). Finally, this became La Tuna Canyon, and now Sun Valley.

In 1874, California State Senator Charles Maclay (for whom Maclay Street in San Fernando is named) acquired 56,000 acres (230 km2) of land across the San Fernando Valley. The area extended from Sunland Blvd. all the way west to the Chatsworth Hills. East of Sunland was Rancho San Rafael, a large land grant to José María Verdugo by the Spanish Crown.

By 1876, the Southern Pacific Railroad was constructed through the eastern San Fernando Valley, linking Southern and Northern California. A general store named Roberts Store was used as a post office and water-tank station; later the area&#x27;s name was changed to Roscoe, reportedly after the name of a railroad crew member.

In the 1920s, development began on the Fernangeles tract (a blend of San Fernando and Los Angeles), with movie producer Cecil B. DeMille among the developers. The current name of Sun Valley was chosen in 1950 by residents.

==Geography==
Sun Valley is bordered on the northeast by Shadow Hills, on the southeast by Burbank, on the south by North Hollywood and Valley Glen, on the west by Panorama City and on the northwest by Pacoima, Hansen Dam and Lake View Terrace.

Situated at the base of the Verdugo Mountains, Sun Valley is prone to flash floods, and one such flood on Sunday, February 20, 2005 at 22:37 (10:37 p.m. PST) destroyed a portion of the 8000 block of Tujunga Avenue and killed a Los Angeles City civil engineer when a sinkhole deep opened.

==Demographics==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 75,848 residents in the 9.42-square-mile Sun Valley neighborhood—or 8,048 people per square mile, about an average population density for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 81,788. In 2000 the median age for residents was 28, considered young for city and county neighborhoods; the percentage of residents aged 10 or younger was among the county&#x27;s highest.

The neighborhood was considered &quot;moderately diverse&quot; ethnically within Los Angeles, with a high percentage of Latinos. The breakdown was Latinos, 69.4%; whites, 17.9%; Asians, 8.1%; blacks, 1.9%; and others, 2.7%. Mexico (54.5%) and El Salvador (11.9%) were the most common places of birth for the 51.9% of the residents who were born abroad—a high percentage for Los Angeles.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $51,290, considered average for the city but low for the county. The percentages of households that earned $20,000 to $60,000 were high for the county. Renters occupied 46.1% of the housing stock, and house or apartment-owners held 53.9%.

==Arts and culture==
Old Trapper&#x27;s Lodge, California Historical Landmark No. 939, an outsider art environment that pays homage to the pioneer upbringing of its creator, John Ehn (1897–1981), was situated in Sun Valley. It represented the life work of the self-taught artist who wished to pass on a sense of the Old West, derived from personal experiences, myths, and tall tales. From 1951 to 1981, using his family as models, and incorporating memorabilia, he followed his dreams and visions to create the lodge and its &quot;Boot Hill.&quot; The artwork was moved from the original site in Sun Valley, CA, and relocated to Pierce College in Woodland Hills.

The Theodore Payne Foundation for Wild Flowers and Native Plants is located in Sun Valley; it is dedicated to helping people discover the beauty of California native plants.

==Parks and recreation==
The Sun Valley Recreation Center in Sun Valley includes a public swimming pool, lighted baseball diamond, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children&#x27;s play area, a football field, picnic tables, a lighted soccer field, lighted tennis courts, and a lighted volleyball court.

The Fernangeles Recreation Center in Sun Valley includes a public swimming pool, an auditorium, barbecue pits, a lighted baseball diamond, lighted indoor basketball courts, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children&#x27;s play area, a lighted football field, an indoor gymnasium with weights, picnic tables, and a lighted soccer field.

The Stonehurst Recreation Center in Sun Valley is a historic site. The center has an indoor gymnasium and auditorium with a capacity of 400 people, barbecue pits, a lighted baseball diamond, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children&#x27;s play area, a community room, a lighted football field, an indoor gymnasium with weights, picnic tables, a lighted soccer field, and volleyball courts.

==Government and infrastructure==

Sun Valley is part of the City of Los Angeles. Los Angeles Fire Department Fire Station 77 is located in the Sun Valley area. The station is in the Battalion 12 district.

The United States Postal Service Sun Valley Post Office is located at 10946 Ratner Street.

==Education==

One of every ten of Sun Valley residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a low percentage for both the city and the county. The percentage of the same-age residents with less than a high school diploma was high for the county.

She was the lead ship of the , which the Navy classified as light cruisers in 1929, with the &quot;Pensacola&quot; herself originally designated as &quot;CL-24.&quot; Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, from 1931 on the class was re-classified as heavy cruisers, with the &quot;Pensacola&quot; being re-designated as &quot;CA-24.&quot; The third Navy ship to be named after the city of Pensacola, Florida, she was nicknamed the &quot;Grey Ghost&quot; by Tokyo Rose.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; departed New York on 24 March 1930, and transited the Panama Canal to Callao, Peru, and Valparaíso, Chile, before returning to New York on 5 June. For the next four years she operated along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean Sea, several times transiting the Panama Canal for combined Fleet battle practice ranging from California to Hawaii.

Originally CL-24, effective 1 July 1931, &quot;Pensacola&quot; was redesignated CA-24 in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; departed Norfolk on 15 January 1935, to join the Pacific Fleet arriving San Diego, her new home port, on 30 January. Fleet problems ranged to Hawaii, one cruise took her to Alaska, and combined fleet maneuvers returned her briefly to the Caribbean Sea before she sailed on 5 October 1939 to base at Pearl Harbor, arriving on the 12th. &quot;Pensacola&quot; was one of six ships to receive the new RCA CXAM radar in 1940. Maneuvers frequently found the cruiser off Midway and French Frigate Shoals, and she made one voyage to Guam.

=== World War II ===

==== 1941–1942 ====
&quot;Pensacola&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 29 November 1941, with the so-called &quot;Pensacola Convoy&quot;, bound for Manila, in the Philippines. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the convoy was diverted to Australia, entering Brisbane harbor on 22 December. &quot;Pensacola&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 19 January 1942, and put to sea on 5 February to patrol the approaches to the Samoan Islands. On 17 February 1942, she rendezvoused off Samoa with Carrier Task Force 11 (TF 11), built around .

Near Bougainville Island, &quot;Pensacola&quot;″s gunners helped repel two waves of Japanese bombers on 20 February. No ships were damaged. Anti-aircraft fire and &quot;Lexington&quot; Combat Air Patrol planes shot down 17 of the 18 attackers.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; continued to help guard &quot;Lexington&quot; on offensive patrol in the Coral Sea until joined the task force on 6 March. The American ships steamed for the Gulf of Papua where—on 10 March—&quot;Lexington&quot; launched planes for a surprise strike over the Owen Stanley Mountains at Japanese shipping and installations at Salamaua and Lae. A complete surprise, the raid caused heavy damage. The task force then turned toward Nouméa, New Caledonia, to replenish. &quot;Pensacola&quot; patrolled with &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s task force until 8 April, then headed, via Samoa, for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 21 April. She carried Marine Fighting Squadron 212 (VMF-212) to Efate in the New Hebrides Islands and returned to Pearl Harbor with on 26 May.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 28 May with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; task force for a rendezvous on 2 June northeast of Midway with units of TF 17. Two days later, when the Japanese armada came within range of the American carriers, the battle of Midway commenced.

Admiral Spruance&#x27;s torpedo planes and dive-bombers attacked the Japanese carriers. and went up in flames, and was badly damaged. A fourth enemy carrier—, still at large—launched strikes at &quot;Yorktown&quot; and the American flattops struck back, leaving the enemy carrier hit many times, in a mass of flames. Meanwhile, &quot;Yorktown&quot;—hit by three bombs—was fighting for her life. &quot;Pensacola&quot; raced from &quot;Enterprise&quot;′s screen to aid the stricken carrier. While trying to assist &quot;Yorktown&quot;, the ship was struck with a torpedo and hit in the galley. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was dead in the water when &quot;Pensacola&quot; arrived, and the cruiser assisted in shooting down four enemy torpedo bombers during a second attack.

Despite all that could be done, &quot;Yorktown&quot; received two torpedo hits amidships and had to be abandoned. &quot;Pensacola&quot; rejoined the screen of &quot;Enterprise&quot; to pursue the retiring Japanese.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 June and—with &quot;Enterprise&quot;—again put to sea on 22 June, carrying 1,157 marines of Marine Aircraft Group 22 (MAG 22) to Midway. She patrolled and trained in Hawaiian waters until 7 August. As Marines stormed the shores of Guadalcanal, the cruiser set course for the Solomons in the screen of , and to support the leathernecks in that bitter campaign. In submarine-infested waters, torpedoes damaged &quot;Saratoga&quot; on 31 August and sank &quot;Wasp&quot; on 15 September.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; arrived at Nouméa, New Caledonia on 26 September, and departed with &quot;Hornet&quot; on 2 October to strike the enemy in the Santa Isabel–Guadalcanal area. On 24 October, &quot;Hornet&quot;′s task group joined &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the combined force steamed to intercept enemy warships approaching the Guadalcanal-Tulagi area.

On 26 October, search planes located a Japanese carrier and battleship formation, beginning the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands which was fought without contact being made between surface ships of the opposing forces. Air strikes inflicted severe bomb damage to and , and sank . Bomb hits damaged and other enemy ships.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; helped fight off a coordinated dive bombing and torpedo plane raid which damaged &quot;Hornet&quot; so severely that she had to be abandoned. Within minutes of the attack on &quot;Hornet&quot;, 24 dive bombers dropped 23 bombs in a run on &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Despite damage, the famed &quot;Fighting Lady&quot; launched a large number of planes from &quot;Hornet&quot; besides her own.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; received 188 survivors from &quot;Hornet&quot;, whom she debarked at Nouméa on 30 October 1942. The task force had turned back a Japanese attempt to regain Guadalcanal, sunk &quot;Yura&quot;, and damaged a number of enemy capital ships. Japanese carriers lost 123 planes.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; departed Nouméa on 2 November to guard transports landing Marine reinforcements, and supplies, at Aola Bay, Guadalcanal. She helped guard &quot;Enterprise&quot; during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 12–13 November. Planes from &quot;Enterprise&quot; assisted in the sinking of , one cruiser, three destroyers, and eleven auxiliaries, and the damaging of four cruisers and four destroyers.

===== Battle of Tassafaronga =====
&quot;Pensacola&quot; returned to Espiritu Santo to join TF 67 under Rear Admiral Carleton H. Wright. On 29 November, TF 67 sailed to intercept a Japanese destroyer-transport force expected off Guadalcanal the next night. Just before midnight of the 30th, the American ships transited Lengo Channel and headed past Henderson Field on Guadalcanal as the Japanese task group steamed on a southerly course west of Savo Island to enter &quot;Ironbottom Sound&quot;.

The two opposing task forces clashed in the Battle of Tassafaronga. American destroyers launched torpedoes as the enemy range came within of &quot;Pensacola&quot;′s cruiser formation. Now gun flashes, tracers, and star shell candles stained the inky darkness. —hit many times—was afire and exploding. took two torpedo hits that blasted her bow downward like an immense scoop and left her forecastle deck awash, but she continued to fight on. closed on &quot;Minneapolis&quot;, and ran into the track of a torpedo that ripped off the forward part of the warship.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; turned left to prevent collision with two damaged American ships ahead of her. Silhouetted by the burning American cruisers, she came into the Japanese line of fire. One of 18 torpedoes launched by Japanese destroyers hit her below the mainmast on the portside. Her engine room flooded, three gun turrets went out of commission, and her oil tanks ruptured to make a soaked torch of her mast. Meantime, maneuvered radically at , her guns continuing their rapid fire as she escaped the trap. The last American cruiser in column——took two torpedo hits to duplicate on a larger scale the havoc inflicted on &quot;Pensacola&quot;.

The oil-fed flames engulfed &quot;Pensacola&quot;″s main deck aft where ammunition exploded. Only supreme effort and skillful damage control by her men saved the ship. The fire—punctuated by the frightful explosion of 8-inch projectiles in her Number 3 turret—gradually subsided. &quot;Pensacola&quot; made steady progress toward Tulagi. She arrived there still aflame. After 12 hours the last fire was quenched. Her dead numbered seven officers and 118 men. One officer and 67 men were injured.

==== 1943–1945 ====
Camouflaged as part of the island, &quot;Pensacola&quot; made repairs in Tulagi Harbor that enabled her to steam to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides Island. She arrived there on 6 December for emergency repairs by until she sailed on 7 January 1943 via Samoa to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 27 January.

On 8 November, &quot;Pensacola&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor in the screen of Southern Attack Force aircraft carriers. On 19 November, Pensacola made bombardment runs on Betio and Tarawa. She rained 600 projectiles to put coast defense guns out of action, and destroyed enemy beach defenses and numerous buildings. As troops stormed ashore on Tarawa on 20 November, the cruiser screened carriers launching air strikes supporting the landings. That night, she fought off Japanese torpedo bombers and assisted into Funafuti, Ellice Islands. For the next two months, she ranged out of that base to screen carriers covering the movement of reinforcements and supplies to the Gilberts. On 29 January 1944, she began strikes and bombardments to destroy Japanese air power and shipping in the Marshall Islands. That night, &quot;Pensacola&quot; helped bombard Taroa in the Eastern Marshalls. She then slammed shells into airfield runways, seaplane ramps, ammunition storage areas and buildings on Wotje. She continued pounding these targets as Marines and Army troops landed on 31 January to seize Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls. The invasion of the Marshall Islands continued on 1 February as Marines occupied Roi and Namur Islands. &quot;Pensacola&quot; continued to hit hard at Taroa, Maloelap Atoll through 18 February, destroying coastal defenses and air bases of the enemy in the eastern Marshalls. Operating from Majuro and Kwajalein, she continued to patrol in approaches of the Marshalls. She again served in the screen of fast carriers conducting raids in the Caroline Islands (30 March–1 April), against Japanese defenses at Palau, Yap, Ulithi and Woleai.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; departed Majuro on 25 April sailing via Pearl Harbor and Mare Island for duty in the Northern Pacific, arriving in Kulak Bay on 27 May. On 13 June, she joined her cruiser-destroyer task force in raining destruction on the airfields of Matsuwa, Kuriles. In the early morning of 26 June, she fired 300 8-inch projectiles to destroy shipping, airfields and installations at Kurabu Zaki, Paramushiru To, Kuriles, returning to Kulak Bay on 28 June. &quot;Pensacola&quot; continued patrol in Alaskan waters until departing Kulak Bay on 8 August for Hawaii.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; arrived Pearl Harbor on 13 August and put to sea on the 29th. &quot;En route&quot; to the Marianas on 3 September, she joined an air-sea bombardment of Wake Island. On 9 October, she pounded the main radio station and installations on Marcus Island. She and her sister cruisers and destroyers stirred up a fire melee in their &quot;impersonation&quot; of Halsey&#x27;s 3rd Fleet to lead the Japanese into thinking the ladder of islands to the Bonins was next on the American timetable for invasion. Meanwhile, Adm. Halsey&#x27;s units advanced on the Philippines while Fast Carriers rained destruction on the enemy air and Fleet bases at Okinawa and Formosa.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; made rendezvous with the units of the Fast Carrier Task Force retiring from the great air battles over Formosa. After escorting and to Ulithi, she joined a Fast Carrier Task Group—including &quot;Wasp&quot;—on 16 October. The following day, troops supported by the 7th Fleet began the liberation of the Philippine Islands.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; screened fast aircraft carriers striking Luzon and directly supported the invasion of Leyte beginning on 20 October. She raced north to aid in the destruction of the enemy carrier force in the battle off Cape Engaño on 25 October, then turned south as the fast carriers launched planes to aid the gallant escort carriers.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; bombarded Iwo Jima on the night of 11/12 November and returned to Ulithi the 14th. As she was about to depart for Saipan on 20 November, she spotted a periscope about to starboard. As she maneuvered clear, rammed the enemy. Four minutes later, her men witnessed the flaming explosion that destroyed , victim of a Japanese &quot;kaiten&quot; midget submarine.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; arrived Saipan on 22 November to prepare for the invasion of Iwo Jima. Five nights later, she helped splash several attacking Japanese aircraft. She departed Saipan on 6 December, plastering Iwo Jima with 500 8-inch projectiles on the 8th. She returned to Iwo Jima on the 24th and 27th, pounding mountain gun positions north of Suribachi Mountain. She hit defenses on Chichi Jima and Haha Jima as well as Iwo Jima on 5 January and 24 January 1945.

At Ulithi on 27 January, &quot;Pensacola&quot; formed with a battleship-cruiser-destroyer gunstrike task force under Rear Admiral B. J. Rodgers. Six battleships, four cruisers and a destroyer screen comprised the bombardment force which sailed on 10 February via Tinian to Iwo Jima.

On 16 February, &quot;Pensacola&quot; opened fire on the northwest sector of Iwo Jima to prepare for the landings. That afternoon, Lieutenant Douglas W. Gandy, USNR—piloting one of &quot;Pensacola&quot;″s OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes—shot down a Japanese fighter. The next morning, &quot;Pensacola&quot; took six hits from enemy shore batteries as her guns covered operations of the minesweepers close inshore. Three of her officers and 14 men were killed. Another five officers and 114 men were injured.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; fired back as she retired for temporary repairs then returned to her bombardment station. The morning of 19 February she commenced harassing and counter-battery fire in direct support of the invasion landings. Her deadly guns fought day and night into 1 March when she silenced enemy shore batteries which had hit amidships. After helping &quot;Terry&quot;′s wounded, she resumed direct bombardment support to advancing Marines that continued into 3 March.

She arrived in Ulithi on 5 March, and was assigned to Task Force 54 (TF 54). They put to sea on the 20th to support the invasion Okinawa, the &quot;last stepping stone&quot; to Japan.

On 25 March, &quot;Pensacola&quot; bombarded enemy defenses and covered the operations of minesweepers preparing the way for the Okinawa invasion landings. On 27 March, she spotted a torpedo wake on her port quarter. A second &quot;fish&quot; streaked toward the ship from dead astern. As her 40 mm gunners opened fire on the torpedoes, &quot;Pensacola&quot; went hard left then hard right to parallel the deadly missiles. The first torpedo missed her starboard quarter by less than . The second passed some along the port side of the cruiser as her gunners opened fire with automatic weapons on a submarine periscope.

&quot;Pensacola&quot; gave direct bombardment support to the initial invasion of Okinawa on 1 April and continued to blast at enemy targets until the 15th. She then sailed via Guam and Pearl Harbor for home. She arrived at Mare Island on 7 May for overhaul.

She sailed on 3 August for Adak, Alaska, and was there when hostilities ended. On the 31st, she sailed with units of Cruiser Division Five &quot;en route&quot; to Ominato, Northern Honshū, Japan. She anchored in the outer harbor of Ominato on 8 September.

=== Post-war ===
&quot;Pensacola&quot; departed Ominato on 14 November to embark 200 veterans at Iwo Jima, then touched Pearl Harbor &quot;en route&quot; to San Francisco, California, arriving on 3 December. Five days later, she put to sea for Apra Harbor, Guam, where she embarked nearly 700 veterans for transport to San Diego, arriving on 9 January 1946.

==== Operation Crossroads ====
&quot;Pensacola&quot; departed San Pedro on 29 April to stage with units of Joint Task Force One at Pearl Harbor in preparation for Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb experiments at Bikini Atoll. She stood out of Pearl Harbor on 20 May, and reached Bikini on the 29th to serve as a target ship. She survived the tests of 1 July and 25 July. On 24 August, she was taken in tow for Kwajalein where she decommissioned on 26 August. Her hulk was turned over to the custody of Joint Task Force One for radiological and structural studies. On completion of these studies, her hulk was sunk on 10 November 1948 off the Washington coast.

<text>USS &quot;Barney&quot; (DD-956/DDG-6) was a &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She was the third Navy ship named for Commodore Joshua Barney USN (1759–1818).

Her original designation was DD-956. On 23 April 1957, it was decided to build her as a guided missile destroyer.

&quot;Barney&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden, New Jersey on 10 August 1959, launched on 10 December 1960, sponsored by Mrs. Harry D. Wortman, and commissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 11 August 1962.

==1960s==

After outfitting at Philadelphia, the guided missile destroyer put to sea on 27 September to conduct pre-shakedown qualification tests off the Virginia Capes and missile firings at Roosevelt Roads near Puerto Rico. At the conclusion of that mission, she arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 December and remained there until the end of the year. &quot;Barney&quot; embarked upon her shakedown cruise on New Year&#x27;s Day 1963 and returned to Norfolk on 20 February 1963 for availability alongside a destroyer tender before moving north to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in mid-March for a post shakedown overhaul. The guided missile destroyer completed the overhaul on 31 May and began normal operations out of Norfolk with the 2nd Fleet. That fall, she headed for the Mediterranean Sea for a five-month cruise with the 6th Fleet. During that deployment, she made port visits and conducted training operations with units of the 6th Fleet and with ships of Allied navies. The warship returned to Norfolk in March 1964 and resumed operations with the 2nd Fleet.

In September 1964, she returned to sea to participate in a series of NATO exercises. Those evolutions continued into November when &quot;Barney&quot; headed back to Norfolk. Type training and 2nd Fleet operations carried her into the New Year. On 15 February 1965, she embarked upon her second tour of duty in the Mediterranean. For the next five months, the warship steamed the length and breadth of the &quot;middle sea&quot; in the screen of a fast carrier task force. She visited a number of ports in France, Italy, and Turkey and participated in a bilateral, American French, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercise, Operation &quot;Fairgame III.&quot; &quot;Barney&quot; returned to Norfolk on 12 July 1965. Second Fleet operations out of Norfolk kept her busy for the remainder of 1965 and the first two months of 1966. Those evolutions included a tour of duty at Key West, Florida, early in January as school ship for the Fleet Sonar School. On 1 March, &quot;Barney&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard to begin her first regular overhaul.

Repairs complete, the guided missile destroyer put to sea on 26 September to conduct ship&#x27;s qualification tests and missile firings. On 7 November, she began a month of post overhaul refresher training out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Following that, the warship conducted a missile firing exercise on the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Range located near Puerto Rico and a gun shoot at Culebra Island. After a visit to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, &quot;Barney&quot; returned to Norfolk on 19 December and remained in the Hampton Roads area for the rest of 1966.

In mid February 1967, the warship departed Norfolk bound for the Far East and her only cruise in the combat zone during the Vietnam War. That deployment lasted almost exactly seven months. On the outbound voyage, she stopped at Mayport, Florida; Guantánamo Bay; the Panama Canal Zone; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Midway Island; Guam in the Marianas; and at Subic Bay in the Philippines. While off Vietnam, &quot;Barney&quot; served in various ways. She performed duty as sea air rescue controller, interdicted Viet Cong seaborne logistics, and shelled targets ashore in both North and South Vietnam. On several occasions, the guided missile destroyer came within range of enemy shore batteries. She suffered no hits, but a member of her crew was wounded, lost his leg, by a shell fragment from a near miss. The warship also visited Hong Kong and ports in the Philippine Islands and in Japan.

Reversing her outbound itinerary—and adding a stop at Okinawa--&quot;Barney&quot; returned to Norfolk on 19 September 1967 and began a post deployment leave and upkeep period. Following the standdown time, the warship resumed operations along the Atlantic seaboard. That occupation continued until early in March 1968 when &quot;Barney&quot; departed Norfolk for her third deployment with the 6th Fleet. Exercises and port visits constituted her main fare as they had in the past. The warship concluded her assignment with the 6th Fleet on 12 July when she departed Pollença Bay, Majorca, to return to Norfolk. She reentered her homeport on 22 July 1968.

After completing the usual post-deployment standdown, &quot;Barney&quot; resumed 2d Fleet operations out of Norfolk. Those operations included the annual winter exercise in the West Indian waters in January 1969 and ASW exercises off the coast of Florida late in February and early in March. She returned to Norfolk on 5 March 1969 to prepare for overseas movement. The guided missile destroyer stood out of Norfolk again on 1 April, bound for European waters. Later that month before &quot;Barney&quot; joined the 6th Fleet, she participated in a trilateral ASW exercise with American, Spanish, and Portuguese warships. That operation was followed by hunter killer exercises in cooperation with . Between 14 and 22 May, the guided missile destroyer visited Portsmouth, England, for the naval review celebrating the 20th anniversary of NATO. She resumed hunter-killer exercises on 22 May and continued them until 2 June when she entered the Mediterranean.

Immediately upon joining the 6th Fleet, &quot;Barney&quot; took part in a bilateral ASW exercise with other units of the fleet and ships of the French Navy. She then visited several ports before joining in an amphibious exercise conducted at Sardinia early in August. More port visits and a carrier screening exercise followed. Finally, on 28 September, she was relieved by at Pollença Bay, Majorca. On the 30th, &quot;Barney&quot; headed back to the United States and arrived in Norfolk on 10 October. The customary leave and upkeep period followed. On 1 December 1969, the guided missile destroyer entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard to begin regular overhaul.

==1970s==

&quot;Barney&quot; completed repairs in June 1970. After post-repair trials, she departed Norfolk on 7 July for refresher training in the West Indies. That assignment lasted until September when she began missile exercises. Those, however, were cut short by an urgent need for her presence in the eastern Mediterranean in response to the Jordanian crisis that resulted when open fighting erupted between the Jordanian Army and PLO guerillas. &quot;Barney&quot; departed Norfolk on 23 September and arrived on station with Task Group (TG) 60.1 on 7 October. Built around carrier , TG 60.1—with &quot;Barney&quot; in the screen—cruised the eastern Mediterranean until the crisis abated early in November. The guided missile destroyer operated with the 6th Fleet for about another month during which time she visited Spanish, Italian, and Maltese ports. On 8 December 1970, she departed Rota, Spain, to return to the United States. She tied up at Norfolk on the 15th and began post deployment and holiday standdown.

Resuming normal operations at and out of Norfolk on 15 January 1971, she underwent various efficiency inspections and got underway frequently for multiship exercises, type training, and single ship drills. She remained so occupied through the summer and into the fall. In October, &quot;Barney&quot; began preparations for another tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. On 1 December, the warship stood out of Norfolk wearing the pennant of the Commander, Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 2. She joined the 6th Fleet at Rota on the 9th and, for the next six months, cruised in the Mediterranean in company with other ships of the 6th Fleet, most frequently in a task group built around &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;. The guided missile destroyer visited ports on the European, African, and Middle Eastern shores of the &quot;middle sea.&quot; She frequently engaged in intelligence surveillance missions directed at Soviet ships in the area. She also participated in at least one bilateral exercise—with of the Royal Navy—as well as in a number of unilateral exercises with other units of the 6th Fleet. On 22 June, she departed the Mediterranean to return home. &quot;Barney&quot; arrived back in Norfolk on 29 June 1972. After the normal leave and upkeep period, she resumed operations out of Norfolk. It was announced that Barney would be relieving a destroyer currently on operations in Vietnam, with operations to begin in January 1973. However, during the prep period for this deployment, Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Vietnamization&quot; plan had begun to be implemented. This had Barney&#x27;s deployment order &#x27;frozen&#x27;. During this &#x27;freeze&#x27; period the decision to deploy Barney to Nato force beginning in July 1973 was ordered. This change of deployment orders allowed for the implementation of the power plant conversion from 600 PSI operation to 1200 PSI, and the conversion of fuel from &#x27;black oil&#x27; to Navy distillate. Those evolutions continued until 8 November when work began to convert her main propulsion plant to the use of Navy distillate fuel.

&quot;Barney&quot;&#x27;s fuel conversion lasted until early in the spring of 1973. On 23 April, she got underway from Norfolk for refresher training in the West Indies. The warship returned to Norfolk on 19 May and remained there until 25 June when she got underway to join NATO&#x27;s Standing Naval Force, Atlantic. &quot;Barney&quot; arrived at the Royal Navy dockyard, Portsmouth, England, on 6 July and operated with the NATO force in European waters for the next five months. During that period, she participated in three multinational maneuvers. One took her into the Baltic where she shadowed Soviet bloc warships. Another saw her cross the Arctic Circle at zero longitude (acquiring the Blue Nose), while the third took place in the North Sea. While on operations in the area of the Kategat and Skaggerak, between Denmark and Sweden, Barney&#x27;s propellers struck bottom at a speed of about 21 to 24 knots. Mud and rocks were observed by the fantail watch to be thrown skyward. Engineering called for a full stop, as seawater was flowing into the aft engineroom with some gusto up the port shaft alley. The impact to the portside propeller had broken one leg of the shaft strut from the hull and the ensuing wobble produced in the shaft had the &#x27;packing&#x27; on the portside shaft displaced into the engineroom followed by flooding. The &#x27;snipes&#x27; did a great job to replace the packing and allow Barney to get back underway, however, speed was limited to a max of 14 knots for the remainder of the deployment. Any attempts at more speed resulted in the shaft packing seal pushing up into the engine room with inevitable flooding. The extent of the damage was unknown to the Captain and crew until a pierside underwater exam complete with live video recording was made in Norfolk (Capt. Corr was standing beside me watching the video). The result of this examination which revealed the extensive damage to both propellers and shafts forced an out of cycle shipyard overhaul, as Barney was unable to be deployed as an effective fighting ship. While finishing the Nato deployment under limited speed restrictions, on 5 December, &quot;Barney&quot; departed the Nato force and headed back to the United States. She arrived in Norfolk on 17 December 1973 and began the usual post deployment standdown period. It was during this standdown that the divers conducted the pierside inspection which revealed the extent of the damage. She remained at Norfolk through the end of the year and for the first three months of 1974. It was during this period the determination was made to &#x27;jump&#x27; Barney ahead of other ships that were due to receive the AN/SQQ-23PAIR sonar retrofit, and conduct the needed major engineering repairs at the same time. On 4 April, she made the short, round trip to Yorktown and back to unload ammunition in preparation for out of cycle overhaul. She stood out of Norfolk on 10 April and arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard the next day.

&quot;Barney&quot; completed her overhaul on 24 February 1975 and arrived back in Norfolk the 26th. She spent the rest of the year operating out of Norfolk, first engaged in post-overhaul refresher training and qualifications and, later, conducting normal Atlantic Fleet operations. That employment carried her into 1976. On 7 July 1976, the guided missile destroyer departed Norfolk bound for the Mediterranean. She reached Rota on 17 July and relieved . For the next six months, she cruised the &quot;middle sea&quot; making port visits and conducting exercises with other units of the 6th Fleet and with elements of allied navies. On 28 January 1977, &quot;Barney&quot; departed Leixões, Portugal, to return to the United States. She tied up at Norfolk on 7 February and, after two weeks of leave and upkeep, went into the drydock at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs to her sonar dome. The guided missile destroyer completed repairs on 14 April and, after sea trials, resumed normal operations out of Norfolk a week later. Training evolutions and inspections occupied her for the remainder of the year and for the first 10 weeks of 1978.

On 16 March 1978, &quot;Barney&quot; departed Norfolk on her way back to the Mediterranean. After stops at Bermuda and at Ponta Delgada in the Azores, she arrived in Rota on the 27th and joined the 6th Fleet. However, &quot;Barney&quot; remained in the &quot;middle sea&quot; only briefly. On 6 April, she transited the Suez Canal and became a unit of the Middle East Force. The warship conducted exercises and made port visits at various East African and Persian Gulf ports over the next four months. She also collected intelligence on Soviet ships operating in the vicinity. On 12 August, she retransited the Suez Canal and briefly rejoined the 6th Fleet. After a stop at Rota on 21 and 22 August, she headed back to the United States and reached Norfolk on 1 September. After three weeks of post deployment leave and upkeep, the guided missile destroyer entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 29 September for a regular overhaul.

==1980s==
The repairs lasted for more than a year. She returned to active duty on 5 November 1979 and for the remainder of that year conducted post overhaul refresher training. Over the next year, she operated along the east coast and in the West Indies training and undergoing inspections. On 18 November 1980, &quot;Barney&quot; stood out of Norfolk bound for the Mediterranean Sea. She arrived in Rota, Spain on the 29th and joined the 6th Fleet. On 21 December, she transited the Suez Canal once again and joined the Middle East Force. Again, she visited many East African and Persian Gulf ports. That assignment lasted until 22 February 1981 when she departed Bahrain to begin the long voyage home. Steaming via the Suez Canal and performing a short tour of duty with the 6th Fleet en route, &quot;Barney&quot; arrived back in Norfolk on 9 April. After post deployment leave and upkeep, she resumed 2d Fleet operations out of Norfolk.
Three other six-month deployments would occur during the 80&#x27;s: Indian Ocean Jan 1982-July 1982, Red Sea/Persian Gulf/Indian Ocean Cruise in 84–85. Also, in 1987–1988 Barney embarked on a Med Cruise that involved a stint with other NATO countries in a joint exercise with other NATO ships (including HMS Ambuscade, BMS Molders, TCG Yucitepe and a Spanish, Australian and Canadian ship) and crews. Port visits included stops at:
Taranto, Genoa and Naples in Italy –
Marseilles, Toulon and Cannes in France –
Alexandria, Egypt –
Izmir, Turkey –
Haifa, Israel –
Cagliari, Sardinia –
Palermo, Sicily-
Barcelona, Spain
After this exercise concluded, she then operated as an escort for the USS Coral Sea battle group before returning to her home port in Norfolk.

Duties in between deployments included ship yard repair stints, one in Norfolk Naval Shipyard and another extended repair stay at Sparrows Point Shipyard in Dundalk (Baltimore), Md. Afterwards, she conducted a pair of joint Navy/Coast Guard Narcotic Interdiction Ops cruises in the Caribbean, including refresher training in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba in preparation for what would be her final cruise in August 1989.

The Barneys final six-month deployment was another &#x27;Med Cruise&#x27; in 1989–1990. With several port visits that included Naples, Italy- Cavalier, France- Haifa, Israel- Tunis, Tunisia- Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia- Rota, Spain while a member of the USS Forrestal Carrier Battle Group.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Barney&quot; was decommissioned on 17 December 1990, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 November 1992 and sold for scrap on 15 April 1994. The scrap contract was terminated on 1 October 1996 and the ship was returned to the Navy on 10 February 1999. The ship was resold on 22 February 2006 for dismantling.

<text>Toluca Lake is a neighborhood in the city of Los Angeles, California, located in the San Fernando Valley northwest of downtown. The name is also given to a private natural lake fed by wells and maintained by neighboring property owners. Prior to the paving of the Los Angeles River in 1938 and L.A. well extraction in the late 19th and 20th century which lowered the water table, Toluca Lake was fed by artesian springs.

The history of Toluca Lake can be traced to the days of the Tongva Indians, followed by Spanish colonization and Mexican independence. Toluca Lake was part of the early rancho system. The original Toluca Lake was divided, with the neighborhood being known as Forman Toluca Ranch. In 1923, investors bought and developed the land as &quot;Toluca Lake Park&quot;.

The neighborhood has had notable residents. Comedian Bob Hope was a longtime resident of Toluca Lake, as were Audie Murphy and Jonathan Winters. Legendary film composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold lived there from 1938 to 1957, right on the lake. Famed actress Bette Davis built a house there. Bing Crosby had a house later owned by Andy Griffith and Jerry Van Dyke. Phil Everly, Mary Astor, Roy Disney, Amelia Earhart, and Frank Sinatra also had houses there. More recently, it has been the home of entertainers such as Hilary Duff, Joseph Campanella, Steve Carell, Wayne Knight, Joe Mantegna, Andy Garcia, Richard Zanuck, Ray Romano, Rick Dees, Patricia Heaton, Melissa McCarthy and Peter Bogdanovich.

==History==
===Early years===
The Tongva people have lived in the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles basin for 8,000 years. The Tongvan settlement Cahuenga used the springs and marsh in the Toluca Lake locale for water, fishing, hunting, harvesting, and building supplies (tule plants).

After the Spanish conquest in the 1790s of Las Californias, the San Fernando Valley, including the &quot;Toluca Lake locale&quot;, became the extended property of the Mission San Fernando Rey de España. After the 1823 Independence of Mexico, the secularization of missions in Alta California included the issuing of a Mexican land grant for Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando. The extreme eastern end of the lake was within the 1843 Rancho Providencia grant to Vincente de la Osa. In 1862, Pío Pico sold his share of the Ex-San Fernando Mission land, the entire southern half of the Valley below Roscoe Boulevard, to Isaac Lankershim (operating as the San Fernando Farm Homestead Association) in 1869. In 1873, Isaac Lankershim&#x27;s son, James Boon Lankershim, and future son-in-law, Isaac Newton Van Nuys, took over management of the property, including the lake at Toluca. During the 1880s, the San Fernando Farm Homestead Association was succeeded by the Los Angeles Farm &amp; Milling Company.
In 1893, a petition was filed with the U.S. Postal Service for the area&#x27;s first post office, to be named &quot;Toluca Post Office&quot;. General Charles Forman, a wealthy local landowner and one of the proponents of the petition, later stated that he had chosen the name &quot;Toluca&quot; from a Paiute word meaning &quot;fertile&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot; valley. Though part of a larger area traditionally called &quot;Lankershim&quot; after a colonel of the same name—and with a Southern Pacific Railroad train station named &quot;Lankershim&quot; that also opened in 1893 across from the post office—Forman called his own ranch and the surrounding land &quot;Toluca&quot;.

One of the wealthiest men in Nevada, Forman had made his fortune starting from nothing, first in mining, then cattle ranching, and then lumber. Falling in love with and marrying Los Angeles native Mary Agnes Gray, he soon moved to the area in the late 1880s and started the Kern River Company, a power company which delivered electricity from generators at the Kern River to Los Angeles. He also bought a large parcel of rich farm land, which included much of modern-day Toluca Lake and at least the western portion of the &quot;ancient and historical&quot; marshy pond now called Toluca Lake. By 1923, the Forman Toluca Lake Ranch was a flourishing producer of peaches, apples, and walnuts.

===Modern development===
In 1923, investors bought and developed the land as Toluca Lake Park. This initial venture failed, but a new group soon took over, renaming the firm as the Toluca Lake Company. With a &quot;vision of creating a first &#x27;bedroom community&#x27; for Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley&quot;, the company formally changed the name of the community to simply Toluca Lake and adopted as their logo the &quot;swan on rippled water&quot; image associated with the community today. The name Lankershim also was considered for the town. Colonel J. B. Lankershim established the town site of Toluca at the eastern edge of the family&#x27;s vast holdings in 1888. The town name was changed from Toluca to Lankershim in 1896. By 1927, the lure of Hollywood inspired local merchants to launch a campaign to change the community&#x27;s name to North Hollywood. The original town site of Toluca is now part of Toluca Lake.
The Lakeside golf course was designed in 1924 by Max Behr. This attracted actor Richard Arlen, who became one of Toluca Lake&#x27;s first residents, and eventually its honorary mayor.

Aviator Amelia Earhart lived in Toluca Lake on Valley Spring Lane after marrying publishing magnate George P. Putnam in 1931. The Spanish colonial-style home, which exists today, features a front-yard tree under which she signed her round-the-world flight plan. She made her home in Toluca Lake because the best aircraft were being designed and built at the Lockheed plant in Burbank.

Entertainer Bob Hope moved to Toluca Lake in the late 1930s, and lived there until his death in 2003 at the age of 100. In the 1938 Little Rascals film &quot;Three Men in a Tub&quot;, the kids hold a regatta on the lake, which was largely surrounded by open country at that time. Actors Bette Davis, W. C. Fields, Dorothy Lamour, Billie Dove, Dick Powell, and Bing Crosby also moved into the community. In 1943, Crosby&#x27;s mansion was almost completely destroyed by fire. Frank Sinatra moved into the home featured player and screen icon Mary Astor built on Toluca Lake in the 1940s. Former actor and 40th President of the United States Ronald Reagan had his wedding reception with second wife Nancy Reagan at the Toluca Lake home of actor (and best man) William Holden on March 4, 1952.

Notable residents have included Steve Carell, Miley Cyrus, Viola Davis, Kirsten Dunst, Melissa McCarthy, and Octavia Spencer. In June 2018, Ron Burkle purchased the 5.2 acre Bob Hope estate for $15 million, with the proceeds going to the Bob and Dolores Hope Foundation. In 2021, Kelly Clarkson purchased an original 1936 colonial-style mansion on a Toluca Lake property.

==Geography==
===Community===
The Toluca Lake neighborhood is situated on 1.22 square miles of the southeastern San Fernando Valley. The Mapping L.A. section of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; website describes it as bounded on the south by Universal City, on the west by Studio City, on the north by North Hollywood and on the east by the city of Burbank.

The Toluca Lake Chamber of Commerce website states that the district is not only a neighborhood in Los Angeles but that it &quot;spills over into Burbank&quot; and &quot;Political entities and others, such as the Greater Toluca Lake Neighborhood Council each draw their own boundaries to suit specific needs. For example, the Toluca Lake Chamber of Commerce serves the entire community in Burbank and Los Angeles, while the City of Los Angeles considers its neighborhood called Toluca Lake to be entirely within its city boundaries&quot;

===Lake===
The geologic Toluca Lake is a body of water located near the district&#x27;s southeastern boundaries. The historic natural lake was fed by springs of upwelling groundwater from the Los Angeles River and San Fernando Valley subterranean aquifers. Late 19th and 20th century L. A. DWP well extraction and 1930s concrete river channelization lowered the water table, and currently community wells at the lake&#x27;s edges maintain the water level. The bottom of the lake is surfaced with four inches (102 mm) of asphalt concrete to prevent seepage. Owned by the surrounding homeowners, the lake has been maintained by the Toluca Lake Property Owners Association, a non-profit corporation established in 1934. The lake, encircled by private residences and the Lakeside Golf Club, is completely inaccessible to and hidden from the public.

===Climate===
==Population==
The Toluca Lake neighborhood had a population of 7,782 in the 2000 census and an estimated population of 8,563 in 2008. At 6,393 people per square mile, its density was among the lowest in the city of Los Angeles. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; its percentage of white people, 71.9%, was high for the county; with black and Asian residents accounting for only 5.3% and 5% of the population, respectively. Principal ethnicities were Latino (14%), German (9.2%) and Irish (8.7%). Only 17.7% of its residents were foreign-born, a low figure compared to the city as a whole; of those, Mexico at 14.7% and the Philippines at 6.9% were the most common foreign places of birth.

The median household income level of its residents was $73,111 in 2008, and 48.4% of its residents 25 and older had a four-year degree, both of which were high for the city. The average household size was 1.9 people, low for both the city and the county. Of its housing units 62.2% were occupied by renters and 37.8% by owners.

Residents&#x27; median age was 37, which was old for the city of Los Angeles and old for the county. Only 9.7% of residents were headed by single parents, a low figure for both the city and the county.

==Politics==
Toluca Lake is represented by the Greater Toluca Lake Neighborhood Council led by Neighborhood Council President Colby Jensen, as well as Adrin Nazarian in the Los Angeles City Council and Jesse Gabriel in the California State Assembly. NBC-4 weatherman Fritz Coleman is the honorary mayor of Toluca Lake.

In 2006, Toluca Lake homeowner groups mobilized against a proposed development in North Hollywood by NBCUniversal and Thomas Properties Group. The Metro Studio Project involves upwards of of space and would house employees leaving NBC&#x27;s Burbank facility. The project also proposes Times Square-style supergraphics and digital illuminated billboards. It would be built partly on land for which NBCUniversal has a lease agreement from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has yet to act on the proposal, and Environmental Impact Reports are not finalized.

==Education==
The 2000 census found that 48.4% of Toluca Lake residents within Los Angeles had earned a four-year degree, a high figure for both the city and the county. The percentage of those residents with a master&#x27;s degree or higher was large for the county.

The Los Angeles section of Toluca Lake is a part of the Los Angeles Unified School District. The Burbank section is within the Burbank Unified School District.

Schools within Toluca Lake are:
* Toluca Lake Elementary School, LAUSD, 4840 Cahuenga Boulevard
* Toluca Crossroads School, private elementary, 4814 Cahuenga Boulevard

== In popular culture ==
Toluca Lake is the setting of &quot;The Bonnie Situation&quot; chapter in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994).

The fictional town of Silent Hill, central to the eponymous video game series, is built on the shores of a fictional body of water called Toluca Lake. It first appeared in the 1999 video game of the same name.

In the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds&#x27;s song &quot;Higgs Boson Blues&quot; (2013), Miley Cyrus is described as floating in a swimming pool in Toluca Lake.

Several episodes of &quot;T.J. Hooker&quot; were filmed in Toluca Lake.
