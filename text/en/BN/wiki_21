<text>Raritan Bay is a bay located at the southern portion of Lower New York Bay between the U.S. states of New York and New Jersey and is part of the New York Bight. The bay is bounded on the northwest by New York&#x27;s Staten Island, on the west by Perth Amboy, New Jersey, on the south by the Raritan Bayshore communities in the New Jersey counties of Middlesex and Monmouth, and on the east by Sandy Hook Bay. The bay is named after the Raritans, a branch of the Lenape tribe who lived in the vicinity of the bay and its river for thousands of years, prior to the arrival of Dutch and English colonists in the 17th century.

== History ==
Archeological evidence suggests that humans were already in the region at the close of the Pleistocene. The early &quot;Big Game Hunters&quot; vanished, but the coastal regions were resettled by peoples accustomed to village-style living (&quot;tidewater communities&quot;) that subsisted on hunting and gathering marine shellfish, and eventually, on agriculture. In pre-Columbian times &quot;woodlands cultures&quot; probably centered in the Ohio Valley became the dominant cultural influence in the region. Large shell middens were found around Raritan Bay and on Staten Island, a testament of the utilization of the bay for food by Algonquin Indian tribes (Lenapes) who occupied the area when early Colonialists arrived. Early settlers used these shell piles for road construction and field fertilizer. Tottenville was once well known for its roads paved with oyster shells.

== Geology ==

The Raritan River was perhaps the major drainage channel along the ice front throughout the Wisconsin glaciation (Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4). Prior to that time the region drained southward across the saddle between the Atlantic Highlands and the Newark Basin into the Delaware River Valley. This saddle area is a very broad flood plain that preserves river terrace gravels (Pensauken Formation) from the Sangemon Interglacial State (Stage 5), as well as older Pleistocene fluvial deposits (Bridgetown Formation). During the lowstand in sea level caused by the Wisconsin glacier, the Raritan River carved back into its headlands and captured the major drainages from the Newark Basin.

As the Wisconsin glaciers melted, the Flandrian Transgression eventually flooded the deeper valleys of the Hudson, Raritan, and Arthur Kill. During warming at the end of the Pleistocene and Early Holocene, the area encompassing Raritan Bay changed from tundra to a landscape dominated by spruce and pine forests. These forests gradually gave way to the modern deciduous forest in the region by mid-Holocene time. Lagoons and bays in the area around Sandy Hook hosted oysters, hard and soft shell clams, lobsters, blue crabs, and a variety of other invertebrates common in bays in the region today. South of western Long Island, tidal flats and wetlands occupied the margins of a tidal estuary (now submerged by marine waters). Inner Raritan Bay began to fill about 2,500 years ago with large oyster beds forming along the estuarine tributaries. Sea level continued to rise about one foot per century. This rise in sea level has resulted in the landward migration of the shoreline (aided by storm-induced coastal erosion) as much as two miles in some portions of the coast since colonial times.

== Economy and ecology ==

The bay supported a lucrative fishing and shellfish industry during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially oysters, which helped to support a stable population around the bay and aided, in part, to feed the flood of immigration. Stable communities continued to grow and change with new industries supporting a larger population base. Advances in methods of fishing and shellfish collecting resulted in overextraction of these resources from the bay. The peak of the fishing industry occurred in the late 1880s to 1910s.

Fishing and farming slowly gave way to industries including ship building, ceramics, chemicals and paint manufacturing, electrolytic copper refining, and petroleum refining. In the Keasbey, New Jersey area, large pits were dug to extract the clays for ceramics and bricks, and huge chemical dumps, fly ash piles, and landfills were created to accommodate the waste from the growing industrial empire. The building of shore management structures (dikes, groins, seawalls), the spraying of DDT (and other pesticides) to control the mosquito problem, the carving of ditches to drain wetlands, the filling of shore lowlands, the channelization of creeks, highway and sewer construction, neighborhood development, and a myriad point and non-point sources of household, automobile, industrial chemicals, and ocean dumping all contributed to growing toxicity of the bay.

For most of the 20th century, the shores of Arthur Kill have been home to the largest petroleum importing, refining, and storage facilities on Earth; as a consequence the estuary has been host to major and minor oil spills. In addition, Arthur Kill drains the area encompassing the second largest landfill on Earth (Fresh Kills Landfill). This landfill, and others along the Raritan River, provide an ample supply of leachate to the waterways. Chemical wastes cause stress and disruption of the life cycles of plankton, shellfish and other invertebrates, and the fish, birds, and other wildlife that they support.

The result was an ecological disaster. The bay approached sterile conditions at the peak of pollution and algal bloom-induced anoxia. Environmental actions from the 1970s to present have helped slowly bring back sea life, but current conditions pale to the wealth of marine resources of the past; certain species of fish and birds continue to decline, and the introduction of tenacious exotic species from around the world contribute to their decline. As a sign of optimism though, oysters are beginning to naturally reappear in the Hudson River after having vanished completely about the time of World War II.

Regional industrial overdevelopment and other pollution factors have raised PCB levels in the fish catch and prompted government recommendations against its routine consumption.

The bay is crossed by a dredged channel allowing commercial ships to enter the Arthur Kill.

== Aquatic species ==
Raritan Bay&#x27;s fish include striped bass, fluke, winter flounder, bluefish, porgy, black sea bass, smoothhound shark, northern puffer, northern king fish, oyster toadfish, tautog and weakfish. The crustacean species represented include the blue crab, fiddler crab, green crab, horseshoe crab and spider crab. Clams and mussels also live in Raritan Bay. The bay is a popular destination for recreational fishing due to its proximity to the densely populated areas of Central Jersey and New York City.

<text>Cristina Sánchez de Pablos (born 20 February 1972) is a Spanish bullfighter who gained prominence during the 1990s for being one of the first female bullfighters. She is the first woman to complete her &quot;alternativa&quot; in Europe.

==Career==
Cristina Sánchez de Pablos was born on 20 February 1972 in Madrid, Spain. She was a professional bullfighter at bullrings in Ecuador and Mexico and undertook many presentations and demonstrations in Spain. She debuted as a bullfighter in Madrid on 13 February 1993. She took her &quot;alternativa&quot; at Nîmes on 25 May 1996. Standing as her &quot;godfather&quot; was Curro Romero, while José Mari Manzanares stood as witness.

Sánchez retired in 1999 and married the Portuguese &quot;banderillero&quot; Alexandre da Silva in 2000.

Sánchez was considered by some to be a representative of the feminist movement of the 1990s, as bullfighting is typically a male-dominated activity. She was also the subject of the Univision TV news program &quot;Primer Impacto&quot;, where Maria Celeste Arraras presented an article about her.

<doc id="430336" wikidata="Q922355" url="?curid=430336" title="Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf">
<text>Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (born Chris Wayne Jackson; March 9, 1969) is an American former professional basketball player. He played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for nine years with the Denver Nuggets, Sacramento Kings and Vancouver Grizzlies.

Abdul-Rauf played college basketball for the LSU Tigers from 1988 to 1990 and was a consensus first-team All-American both seasons he played. He was chosen as the 3rd overall pick in the 1990 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. Abdul-Rauf was selected for the NBA Most Improved Player Award in 1993, appeared in the Slam Dunk Contest at the 1993 NBA All-Star Weekend, and was one of the league&#x27;s most accurate free throw shooters. After his NBA career, he played in multiple leagues around the world.

Abdul-Rauf sparked controversy during his NBA career when he refused to stand for the national anthem in a sign of protest and called the flag of the United States a symbol of oppression.

==Early life and career==
Abdul-Rauf was born Chris Jackson in Gulfport, Mississippi, the son of Jacqueline Jackson. He was raised in a single-parent family, along with his two brothers, Omar and David. His childhood was characterized by poverty, as there were times when he and his brothers were not able to have proper nutrition. Abdul-Rauf missed the fourth grade and was later placed in special education classes. He had a moderate form of Tourette syndrome, a condition that went undiagnosed until he was 17. Abdul-Rauf managed to overcome difficulties to become a basketball prodigy for Gulfport High School. In his senior season in high school he averaged 29.9 points and 5.7 assists per game and was called up to the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game. He was also named Mississippi Mr. Basketball twice, in 1987 and 1988.

Having never played an organized game, Abdul-Rauf was discovered by a middle-school girls coach in Gulfport, MS during lunch period on the playground. Recognizing his skill, she convinced his mother to allow him to play organized basketball.

==College career==
Abdul-Rauf was a standout freshman for LSU, scoring 48 points against Louisiana Tech in just his third game for the school. He set the scoring record for a freshman, with 53 points against Florida. On March 4, 1989, he scored 55 points against Ole Miss to top his personal best, while also setting a career-high for three-pointers made, with 10. In the same game, Ole Miss&#x27; Gerald Glass scored 53, making their 108 combined points the most ever by two players in an SEC game He appeared in 32 games in his freshman season, setting the NCAA record for points by a freshman (965) and points per game by a freshman (30.2). He was named SEC Player of the Year and First-team All-American. In his sophomore season, he produced similar numbers with his scoring average slightly falling to 27.8 per game. On February 10, 1990, he tied his career-high for three-pointers made, while finishing the game with 49 points. He was named SEC Player of the Year and First-team All-American for a second year in a row. After a remarkable two-year stint at LSU, Abdul-Rauf declared for the NBA draft.

His #35 jersey was retired by the Tigers in 2020.

==Professional career==
Abdul-Rauf was selected with the third pick in the 1990 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. In his first season in the NBA he was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. Despite the fact that he never dunked in an actual game, he participated in the 1993 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, after Nuggets president and general manager Bernie Bickerstaff sent NBA league officials a tape of Abdul-Rauf showcasing his dunking ability. Abdul-Rauf led the league in free throw percentage in the 1993–94 and 1995–96 seasons. His free throw percentage of .956 in 1993–94 is the third highest seasonal percentage in NBA history, behind Calvin Murphy (.958, 1980–81) and José Calderón (.981, 2008–09). He played with Denver until 1996, and was a key player on that team, winning the NBA Most Improved Player Award in 1993. In November 1995 he scored 30 points and a career-high 20 assists against the Phoenix Suns. On December 8, 1995, Abdul-Rauf posted a career-high 51 points against the Utah Jazz. In June 1996, he was traded to the Sacramento Kings for Sarunas Marciulionis and a second-round pick.

In 1998 Abdul-Rauf signed a two-year, $3.4 million contract with Fenerbahçe of the Turkish Basketball League. He left the club without finishing the season, stating he would retire from basketball due to loss of interest in the game. After not playing for the entire 1999–00 season, he signed with the Vancouver Grizzlies in August 2000. In December 2003 Abdul-Rauf signed with Ural Great of the Russian Basketball Super League. In 2004, he signed with Italian Serie A club Sedima Roseto. Averaging 18.4 points and 2.2 assists per game in the 2004–05 season he signed a contract with Udine in July 2005, but he sat out the entire season due to a torn achilles tendon. For the 2006–07 season, he came out of retirement for the third time in his career to play for Aris Thessaloniki. In November 2007 he signed a contract with Al-Ittihad of the Saudi Basketball League. In August 2009 he signed with Basketball Japan League team Kyoto Hannaryz. He averaged 17.9 points in 38 games in his first season in Japan. In July 2010, he re-signed with Kyoto Hannaryz for the 2010–11 season.

He is currently playing in the BIG3 basketball league for the 3 Headed Monsters. In 2018 he placed 5th in 3-point field goal percentage hitting them at a 45.5% clip.

==Personal life==
Abdul-Rauf was introduced to Islam when he was given the book &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; by his LSU coach, Dale Brown. He was introduced to the Quran during his rookie season with the Denver Nuggets and converted to Islam shortly afterward. He changed his name from Chris Jackson to Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf in 1993. He is the father of five children.

Following his NBA career, Abdul-Rauf moved to Florida after his house in Necaise, Mississippi was burned to the ground in 2001. Investigators determined it was arson, and the FBI investigated, according to the Clarion-Ledger, but no one was ever charged.

In December 2001, Abdul-Rauf appeared on an episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Sports&quot; where he stated that he thought the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. were an inside job and suggested that Israel might have been involved in the attacks.

==National anthem controversy==

Abdul-Rauf is perhaps best known for the controversy created when he refused to stand for &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before games, stating that the flag was a symbol of oppression and that the United States had a long history of tyranny. On March 12, 1996, the NBA suspended Abdul-Rauf for his refusal to stand, costing Abdul-Rauf $31,707 per missed game. Two days later, he worked out a compromise with the league, whereby he would stand during the playing of the national anthem but could close his eyes and look downward. He usually silently recited Islamic prayer during this time for those who are suffering from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds.

In an apparent publicity stunt linked to this controversy, four employees of Denver&#x27;s KBPI radio station were charged with misdemeanor offenses related to entering a Colorado mosque and playing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; on a bugle and trumpet, in a response to Abdul-Rauf&#x27;s refusal to stand for the national anthem.

<text>The second USS &quot;Norfolk&quot; (DL-1) was the first destroyer leader of the United States Navy. Originally projected as a hunter-killer cruiser, she was in service until 1970, and was scrapped in 1974.

==History==
The first major U.S. warship built after the construction boom of World War II, &quot;Norfolk&quot; was designed beginning in 1945, designated project SCB 1 in 1946, and authorized in 1947 as CLK-1, an anti-submarine hunter killer ship which could operate under all weather conditions and would carry the latest radar, sonar, and other electronic devices. She was designed on a light cruiser hull so she could carry a greater variety of detection gear than a destroyer.

She was laid down 1 September 1949 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, launched 29 December 1951 with the destroyer leader reclassification DL-1, sponsored by Miss Betty King Duckworth, and commissioned 4 March 1953, Capt. Clarence Matheson Bowley in command.

After her Caribbean shakedown cruise (February 1954), &quot;Norfolk&quot; was assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and between 1955 and 1957 served successively as flagship for Commander Destroyer Flotillas 2, 4, and 6. During 1956 and 1957 she acted as flagship for Commander Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. In June 1957, &quot;Norfolk&quot; participated in the International Fleet Review as flagship for Admiral Jerauld Wright, Commander-in-Chief Atlantic Fleet and Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic for NATO.

A boiler on the ship blew up in late 1955.

By 1959 &quot;Norfolk&quot;″s eight 3 inch/50 caliber guns had been replaced by eight 3 inch/70 caliber guns and her 20 mm battery had been removed. In 1960 the addition of an ASROC launcher enhanced her antisubmarine capabilities.

On 10 May 1960, an 83-foot Cuban vessel harassed &quot;Norfolk&quot; while she was patrolling the Florida Straits with in Cuban waters.

In Fall 1961 she took part in UNITAS II as flagship for Commander Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 2. During the operation she performed ASW training exercises with the navies of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. &quot;Norfolk&quot; repeated this cruise over the next five years during which she served as flagship of Commander South Atlantic Forces except in 1962 when she was flagship for Commander Cruiser Destroyer Forces Atlantic Fleet.

In 1965 she was the flagship for UNITAS VI.

&quot;Norfolk&quot; joined LANTFLEX 66 as flagship between 28 November and 16 December 1966. During this exercise she shadowed the Russian trawlers &quot;Repiter&quot; and &quot;Teodilit&quot;. She proved her antisubmarine capabilities again as flagship for Commander South Atlantic Forces during UNITAS VIII in Fall 1967.

&quot;Norfolk&quot; was assigned to Commander Middle East Force as flagship (17 April–15 October 1968). On this mission she visited Bahrain, French Somaliland, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia. Kenya, the Seychelles, Mauritius, Malagasy Republic, India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, Mexico, and Panama Canal Zone.

In October 1968 &quot;Norfolk&quot; returned to Norfolk where she decommissioned 15 January 1970 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. By 1 September 1974, &quot;Norfolk&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrap.

==CLK-2==
A projected sister ship, to be named &quot;New Haven&quot;, was deferred and then cancelled in favor of the smaller and less expensive s, due to the high cost ($61.9 million) of &quot;Norfolk&quot;. While &quot;Norfolk&quot; was fully combat ready, she was effectively a one ship class experiment that tested new ASW weapons and concepts.

==Memorials==
Two of &quot;Norfolk&quot;&#x27;s 3″/70 gun mounts were saved from the scrap heap and were on display at the Naval Training Center in Orlando, Florida. When NTC-Orlando closed, the Boca Raton Community High School&#x27;s NJROTC requested custodianship of the mounts. The guns then stood near the east end zone of the football field in Boca Raton, Florida. The two mounts were then moved to Naval Station Norfolk by November 2020 and with the help of volunteers of current and former military personnel have been in the process of cleaning and preserving them in preparation for their display in front of Commander Naval Surface Force Atlantic headquarters.

&quot;Norfolk&quot;&#x27;s bell is preserved in Norfolk, Virginia. From 1975 to 1987 the bell was located at the foot of St. Paul&#x27;s Boulevard along the Elizabeth River waterfront. The bell was moved to Town Point Park and then eventually relocated to Wisconsin Square, Norfolk, just north of the museum ship berth of .

<text>USS &quot;Capelin&quot; (SS-289), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the capelin, a small fish of the smelt family. She is credited with having sunk 3,127 gross register tons of shipping on her single war patrol.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Capelin&quot;′s keel was laid down by Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 20 January 1943, sponsored by Mrs. I. C. Bogart, and commissioned on 4 June 1943.

==Service history==
&quot;Capelin&quot; sailed from New London, Connecticut, on 3 September 1943, bound for Brisbane, Australia, and duty with Submarine Force, Southwest Pacific. Her first war patrol, conducted in the Molucca Sea, Flores Sea, and Banda Sea between 30 October and 15 November, found her sinking a 3127-ton Japanese cargo ship on 11 November off Ambon Island.

&quot;Capelin&quot; returned to Darwin, Australia, with a defective conning tower hatch mechanism, excessively noisy bow planes, and a defective radar tube. These flaws were corrected, and &quot;Capelin&quot; put out on her second war patrol 17 November 1943, in the Molucca Sea and Celebes Sea, and she was to pay particular attention to Kaoe Bay, Morotai Strait, Davao Gulf, and trade routes in the vicinity of Siaoe Island, Sangi Island, Talaud Islands and Sarangani Island. She was to leave her area at dark 6 December.

==Disappearance and aftermath==

The submarine reported sighting an American submarine on 2 December 1943 in the area assigned to &quot;Capelin&quot; at that time. The unidentified submarine quickly dived, probably after sighting &quot;Bonefish&quot;. &quot;Bonefish&quot; sent a message via sonar giving Commander Marshall&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Steam&quot;. The other submarine returned an acknowledgement. Following this, &quot;Capelin&quot; was never heard from again. The U.S. Navy broke radio silence on 9 December 1943 in an attempt to contact &quot;Capelin&quot;, but without success.

Japanese records studied after the war listed an attack by the minelayer &quot;Wakataka&quot; on a supposed United States submarine on 23 November 1943 off Kaoe Bay, Halmahera, Indonesia, with the Japanese ship noting the attack produced oily black water columns that contained wood and cork splinters and that later a raft was found. This is the only reported attack in the appropriate area at that time, and it occurred nine days before &quot;Bonefish&quot;″s apparent contact with &quot;Capelin&quot;. Also, Japanese minefields are now known to have been placed in various positions along the north coast of Celebes (now known as Sulawesi) in &quot;Capelin&quot;&#x27;s patrol area, and she may have been lost to a naval mine. Gone without a trace with the loss of her entire crew, &quot;Capelin&quot; remains on the list of ships lost without a known cause.

<doc id="430345" wikidata="Q1931903" url="?curid=430345" title="Middlemarch, New Zealand">
<text>Middlemarch is a small town in the Otago region of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It lies at the foot of the Rock and Pillar Range of hills in the broad Strath-Taieri valley, through which flows the middle reaches of the Taieri River. Since local government reorganisation in the late 1980s, Middlemarch and much of the Strath-Taieri has been administered as part of Dunedin city, the centre of which lies some 80 km to the southeast. Middlemarch is part of the Taieri electorate (formerly known as Dunedin South), and is currently represented in parliament by Ingrid Leary. Middlemarch has reticulated sewerage but no reticulated water supply. A description of 1903, that &quot;[T]he summer seasons are warm, but not enervating, and the winters cold, but dry&quot; is still true today.

It is a crucial service town for the local farming community, the terminus of the Taieri Gorge Railway, and the start of the Otago Central Rail Trail.

Several suggestions exist about how the township was named. One is that Mrs Alice Humphreys (née Hawdon, 1848–1934), whose husband Edward Wingfield Humphreys owned and had surveyed for sale sections in this new township, named the town in 1876 after George Eliot&#x27;s novel &quot;Middlemarch: A Study of Provincial Life&quot;. Another is that the name is from the now obsolete English term &quot;march&quot; meaning a boundary - in this case a middle area between two rivers. As with many places in and close to the Maniototo area, its name may have been influenced by the Northumberland ancestry of early surveyor John Turnbull Thomson (there is a Middle March region in Northumberland, centred on the town of Otterburn).

==Demographics==
Middlemarch is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement. It covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the much larger Strath Taieri statistical area.

Middlemarch had a population of 153 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 3 people (−1.9%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 12 people (−7.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 66 households, comprising 81 males and 72 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.12 males per female. The median age was 50.2 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 21 people (13.7%) aged under 15 years, 18 (11.8%) aged 15 to 29, 90 (58.8%) aged 30 to 64, and 30 (19.6%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 96.1% European/Pākehā, and 21.6% Māori. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 62.7% had no religion, and 31.4% were Christian.

Of those at least 15 years old, 12 (9.1%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 30 (22.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $25,200, compared with $31,800 nationally. 15 people (11.4%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 51 (38.6%) people were employed full-time, 21 (15.9%) were part-time, and 6 (4.5%) were unemployed.

==Education==
Strath Taieri School is a co-educational state full primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of students as of . The school opened in 1880, and was initially a high school. It became a full primary in 1975.

== Museum ==
Middlemarch Museum, located on Aberafon Street, shares the social history of the region. 

The museum&#x27;s collection includes the &quot;Platypus&quot;, a 10-metre long iron-plate submarine. It was built in 1873 in Dunedin to mine for underwater gold, and is thought to be the only submarine to have been built in New Zealand.

==Climate==

The Taieri Pet is a lenticular cloud formation that occurs in the Strath-Taieri region. The cloud formation is created when north-westerly winds are forced upward over the Rock and Pillar Range. The cloud is a common feature in the skies near Middlemarch.

<text>The peony or paeony () is any flowering plant in the genus Paeonia, the only genus in the family Paeoniaceae. Peonies are native to Asia, Europe, and Western North America. Scientists differ on the number of species that can be distinguished, ranging from 25 to 40, although the current consensus describes 33 known species. The relationships between the species need to be further clarified.

Most are herbaceous perennial plants tall, but some are woody shrubs tall. They have compound, deeply lobed leaves and large, often fragrant flowers, in colors ranging from purple and pink to red, white or yellow, in late spring and early summer. The flowers have a short blooming season, usually lasting for only 7–10 days.

Peonies are popular garden plants in temperate regions. Herbaceous peonies are also sold as cut flowers on a large scale, although they generally are only available in late spring and early summer.

== Description ==
=== Morphology ===
All Paeoniaceae are herbaceous perennials or deciduous shrubs, with thick storage roots and thin roots for gathering water and minerals. Some species are caespitose (tufted), because the crown produces adventitious buds, while others have stolons. They have rather large compound leaves without glands and stipules, and with anomocytic stomata. In the woody species the new growth emerges from scaly buds on the previous flush or from the crown of the rootstock. The large bisexual flowers are mostly single at the end of the stem. In &quot;P. emodi&quot;, &quot;P. lactiflora&quot;, &quot;P. veitchii&quot; and many of the cultivars these contributed to, few additional flowers develop in the axils of the leaves. Flowers close at night or when the sky is overcast. Each flower is subtended by a number of bracts, that may form a sort of involucre, has 3-7 tough free sepals and mostly 5–8, but occasionally up to 13 free petals. These categories however are intergrading, making it difficult to assign some of them, and the number of these parts may vary. Within are numerous (50–160) free stamens, with anthers fixed at their base to the filaments, and are sagittate in shape, open with longitudinal slits at the outer side and free pollen grains which have three slits or pores and consist of two cells. Within the circle of stamens is a more or less prominent, lobed disc, which is presumed not to excrete nectar. Within the disk is a varying number (1-15) of separate carpels, which have a very short style and a decurrent stigma. Each of these develops into a dry fruit (which is called a follicle), which opens with a lengthwise suture and each of which contains one or a few large fleshy seeds. The annual growth is predetermined: if the growing tip of a shoot is removed, no new buds will develop that season.

=== Phytochemistry ===
Over 262 compounds have been obtained so far from the plants of Paeoniaceae. These include monoterpenoid glucosides, flavonoids, tannins, stilbenoids, triterpenoids, steroids, paeonols, and phenols. &quot;In vitro&quot; biological activities include antioxidant, antitumor, antipathogenic, immunomodulative, cardiovascular-system-protective activities and central-nervous-system activities.

Paeoniaceae are dependent on C3 carbon fixation. They contain ellagic acid, myricetin, ethereal oils and flavones, as well as crystals of calcium oxalate. The wax tubules that are formed primarily consist of palmitone (the ketone of palmitic acid).

=== Genome ===
The basic chromosome number is five. About half of the species of the section &quot;Paeonia&quot; however is tetraploid (4n=20), particularly many of those in the Mediterranean region. Both allotetraploids and autotetraploids are known, and some diploid species are also of hybrid origin.

== Taxonomy ==
The family name &quot;Paeoniaceae&quot; was first used by Friedrich K.L. Rudolphi in 1830, following a suggestion by Friedrich Gottlieb Bartling that same year. The family had been given other names a few years earlier. The composition of the family has varied, but it has always consisted of &quot;Paeonia&quot; and one or more genera that are now placed in Ranunculales. It has been widely believed that &quot;Paeonia&quot; is closest to &quot;Glaucidium&quot;, and this idea has been followed in some recent works. Molecular phylogenetic studies, however, have demonstrated conclusively that &quot;Glaucidium&quot; belongs in the family Ranunculaceae, order Ranunculales, but that &quot;Paeonia&quot; belongs in the unrelated order Saxifragales. The genus &quot;Paeonia&quot; consists of about 35 species, assigned to three sections: &quot;Moutan&quot;, &quot;Onaepia&quot; and &quot;Paeoniae&quot;. The section &quot;Onaepia&quot; only includes &quot;P. brownii&quot; and &quot;P. californica&quot;. The section &quot;Moutan&quot; is divided into &quot;P. delavayi&quot; and &quot;P. ludlowii&quot;, together making up the subsection &quot;Delavayanae&quot;, and &quot;P. cathayana&quot;, &quot;P. decomposita&quot;, &quot;P. jishanensis&quot;, &quot;P. osti&quot;, &quot;P. qiui&quot; and &quot;P. rockii&quot; which constitute the subsection &quot;Vaginatae&quot;. &quot;P. suffruticosa&quot; is a cultivated hybrid swarm, not a naturally occurring species.

The remainder of the species belongs to the section &quot;Paeonia&quot;, which is characterised by a complicated reticulate evolution. Only about half of the (sub)species is diploid, the other half tetraploid, while some species both have diploid and tetraploid populations. In addition to the tetraploids, are some diploid species also likely the result of hybridisation, or nothospecies. Known diploid taxa in the &quot;Paeonia&quot;-section are &quot;P. anomala&quot;, &quot;P. lactiflora&quot;, &quot;P. veitchii&quot;, &quot;P. tenuifolia&quot;, &quot;P. emodi&quot;, &quot;P. broteri&quot;, &quot;P. cambedessedesii&quot;, &quot;P. clusii&quot;, &quot;P. rhodia&quot;, &quot;P. daurica&quot; subsps. &quot;coriifolia&quot;, &quot;daurica&quot;, &quot;macrophylla&quot; and &quot;mlokosewitschii&quot;. Tetraploid taxa are &quot;P. arietina&quot;, &quot;P. officinalis&quot;, &quot;P. parnassica&quot;, &quot;P. banatica&quot;, &quot;P. russi&quot;, &quot;P. peregrina&quot;, &quot;P. coriacea&quot;, &quot;P. mascula&quot; subsps. &quot;hellenica&quot; and &quot;mascula&quot;, and &quot;P. daurica&quot; subsps. &quot;tomentosa&quot; and &quot;wittmanniana&quot;. Species that have both diploid and tetraploid populations include &quot;P. clusii&quot;, &quot;P. mairei&quot; and &quot;P. obovata&quot;. &quot;P. anomala&quot; was proven to be a hybrid of &quot;P. lactiflora&quot; and &quot;P. veitchii&quot;, although being a diploid with 10 chromosomes. &quot;P. emodi&quot; and &quot;P. sterniana&quot; are diploid hybrids of &quot;P. lactiflora&quot; and &quot;P. veitchii&quot; too, and radically different in appearance. &quot;P. russi&quot; is the tetraploid hybrid of diploid &quot;P. lactiflora&quot; and &quot;P. mairei&quot;, while &quot;P. cambedessedesii&quot; is the diploid hybrid of &quot;P. lactiflora&quot;, likely &quot;P. mairei&quot;, but possibly also &quot;P. obovata&quot;. &quot;P. peregrina&quot; is the tetraploid hybrid of &quot;P. anomala&quot; and either &quot;P. arietina&quot;, &quot;P. humilis&quot;, &quot;P. officinalis&quot;, &quot;P. parnassica&quot; or less likely &quot;P. tenuifolia&quot;, or one of their (now extinct) common ancestors. &quot;P. banatica&quot; is the tetraploid hybrid of &quot;P. mairei&quot; and one of this same group. &quot;P. broteri&quot;, &quot;P. coriacea&quot;, &quot;P. clusii&quot;, &quot;P. rhodia&quot;, &quot;P. daurica&quot; subsp. &quot;mlokosewitschi&quot;, &quot;P. mascula&quot; subsp. &quot;hellenica&quot; and ssp. &quot;mascula&quot;, and &quot;P. daurica&quot; subsp. &quot;wittmanniana&quot; are all descendants of hybrids of &quot;P. lactiflora&quot; and &quot;P. obovata&quot;.

=== Phylogeny ===
Recent genetic analyses relate the monogeneric family Paeoniaceae to a group of families with woody species in the order Saxifragales. This results in the following relationship tree. One dissertation suggests the section &quot;Onaepia&quot; branches off earliest, but a later publication of the same author and others suggests the &quot;Moutan&quot;-section splits off first. Within that section &quot;P. ludlowii&quot; and &quot;P. delavayi&quot; are more related to each other than to any other species.

== Distribution ==
The genus &quot;Paeonia&quot; naturally occurs in the temperate and cold areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The section &quot;Moutan&quot;, which includes all woody species, is restricted in the wild to Central and Southern China, including Tibet. The section &quot;Onaepia&quot; consist of two herbaceous species and is present in the West of North-America, &quot;P. brownii&quot; between southern British Columbia and the Sierra Nevada in California and eastward to Wyoming and Utah, while &quot;P. californica&quot; is limited to the coastal mountains of Southern and Central California.

The section &quot;Paeonia&quot;, which comprises all other herbaceous species, occurs in a band stretching roughly from Morocco and Spain to Japan. One species of the section &quot;Paeonia&quot;, &quot;P. anomala&quot;, has by far the largest distribution, which is also north of the distribution of the other species: from the Kola peninsula in North-West Russia, to Lake Baikal in Siberia and South to the Tien Shan Mountains of Kazakhstan. The rest of the section concentrates around the Mediterranean, and in Asia.

The species around the Mediterranean include &quot;Paeonia algeriensis&quot; that is an endemic of the coastal mountains of Algeria, &quot;P. coriacea&quot; in the Rif Mountains and Andalusia, &quot;P. cambessedesii&quot; on Majorca, &quot;P. russoi&quot; on Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily, &quot;P. corsica&quot; on Corsica, Sardinia, the Ionian islands and in western Greece, &quot;P. clusii&quot; subsp. &quot;clusii&quot; on Crete and Karpathos, and subsp. &quot;rhodia&quot; on Rhodes, &quot;P. kesrouanensis&quot; in the Western Taurus Mountains, &quot;P. arietina&quot; from the Middle Taurus Mountains, &quot;P. broteri&quot; in Andalucia, &quot;P. humilis&quot; from Andalucia to the Provence, &quot;P. officinalis&quot; from the South of France, through Switzerland to the Middle of Italy, &quot;P. banatica&quot; in western Romania, northern Serbia and Slovenia and in southern Hungary, &quot;P. peregrina&quot; in Albania, western Bulgaria, northern Greece, western Romania, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia, while &quot;P. mascula&quot; has a large distribution from Catalonia and southern France to Israel and Turkey.

Between the two concentrations, the subspecies of &quot;Paeonia daurica&quot; occur, with subspecies &quot;velebitensis&quot; in Croatia, and &quot;daurica&quot; in the Balkans and Crimea, while the other subspecies &quot;coriifolia&quot;, &quot;macrophylla&quot;, &quot;mlokosewitschii&quot;, &quot;tomentosa&quot; and &quot;wittmanniana&quot; are known from the Caucasus, Kaçkar and Alborz Mountains.

&quot;Paeonia emodi&quot; occurs in the western Himalayas between Pakistan and western Nepal, &quot;P. sterniana&quot; is an endemic of southeastern Tibet, &quot;P. veitchii&quot; grows in Central China (Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan and the eastern rim of Tibet), like &quot;P. mairei&quot; (Gansu, Guizhou, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan), while &quot;P. obovata&quot; grows in warm-temperate to cold China, including Manchuria, Korea, Japan, Far Eastern Russia (Primorsky Krai) and on Sakhalin, and &quot;P. lactiflora&quot; occurs in Northern China, including Manchuria, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, Russia (Far East and Siberia).

=== Distributional history ===
The species of the section &quot;Paeonia&quot; have a disjunct distribution, with most of the species occurring in the Mediterranean, while many others occur in eastern Asia. Genetic analysis has shown that all Mediterranean species are either diploid or tetraploid hybrids that resulted from the crossbreeding of species currently limited to eastern Asia. The large distance between the ranges of the parent species and the nothospecies suggest that hybridisation already occurred relatively long ago. It is likely that the parent species occurred in the same region when the hybrids arose, and were later exterminated by successive Pleistocene glaciations, while the nothospecies remained in refugia to the South of Europe. During their retreat, &quot;P. lactiflora&quot; and &quot;P. mairei&quot; likely became sympatric and so produced the Himalayan nothospecies &quot;P. emodi&quot; and &quot;P. sterniana&quot;.

== Cultivation ==
Ancient Chinese texts mention the peony was used for flavoring food. Peonies have been used and cultivated in China since early history. Ornamental cultivars were created from plants cultivated for medicine in China as of the sixth and seventh century. Peonies became particularly popular during the Tang dynasty, when they were grown in the imperial gardens. In the tenth century the cultivation of peonies spread through China, and the seat of the Song dynasty, Luoyang, was the centre for its cultivation, a position it still holds today. 

A second centre for peony cultivation developed during the Qing dynasty in Cáozhōu, now known as He Ze. Both cities still host annual peony exhibitions and state-funded peony research facilities. Before the tenth century, &quot;P. lactiflora&quot; was introduced in Japan, and over time many varieties were developed both by self fertilisation and crossbreeding, particularly during the eighteenth to twentieth centuries (middle Edo to early Shōwa periods). During the 1940s Toichi Itoh succeeded in crossing tree peonies and herbaceous peonies and so created a new class of so-called intersectional hybrids. Although &quot;P. officinalis&quot; and its cultivars were grown in Europe from the fifteenth century on, originally also for medicinal purposes, intensive breeding started only in the nineteenth century when &quot;P. lactiflora&quot; was introduced from its native China to Europe. The tree peony was introduced in Europe and planted in Kew Gardens in 1789. The main centre of peony breeding in Europe has been in the United Kingdom, and particularly France. Here, breeders like Victor Lemoine and François Félix Crousse selected many new varieties, mainly with &quot;P. lactiflora&quot;, such as &quot;Avant Garde&quot; and &quot;Le Printemps&quot;. The Netherlands is the largest peony cut flower producing country with about 50 million stems each year, with &quot;Sarah Bernhardt&quot; dominating the sales with over 20 million stems. An emerging source of peonies in mid to late summer is the Alaskan market. Unique growing conditions due to long hours of sunlight create availability from Alaska when other sources have completed harvest.

=== Plant growth habits ===
While the peony takes several years to re-establish itself when moved, it blooms annually for decades once it has done so.

Peonies tend to attract ants to the flower buds. This is due to the nectar that forms on the outside of the flower buds, and is not required for the plants&#x27; own pollination or other growth. The presence of ants is thought to provide some deterrence to other harmful insects though, so the production of ant-attracting nectar is plausibly a functional adaptation. Ants do not harm the plants.

Peony species come in two distinct growth habits, while hybrid cultivars in addition may occupy an intermediate habit.
* herbaceous: During summer, renewal buds develop on the underground stem (the &quot;crown&quot;), particularly at the foot of the current season&#x27;s annual shoots. These renewal buds come in various sizes. Large buds will grow into stems the following growing season, but smaller buds remain dormant. The primordia for the leaves can already be found in June, but the flower only starts differentiating in October, as the annual shoots die down, completing its development in December, when sepals, petals, stamens and pistils are all recognisable.
* tree: During the summer, large buds develop at the tip of the annual growth and near its foot. In the autumn, the leaves are shed, and the new stems become woody and are perennial.
* Itoh (or &quot;Intersectional&quot;): In 1948 horticulturist Toichi Itoh from Tokyo used pollen from the yellow tree peony &quot;Alice Harding&quot; to fertilize the herbaceous &quot;P. lactiflora&quot; &quot;Katoden&quot;, which resulted in a new category of peonies, the Itoh or intersectional cultivars. These are herbaceous, have leaves like tree peonies, with many large flowers from late spring to early autumn, and good peony wilt resistance. Some of the early Itoh cultivars are &quot;Yellow Crown&quot;, &quot;Yellow Dream&quot;, &quot;Yellow Emperor&quot; and &quot;Yellow Heaven&quot;.

=== Flower types ===
Seven types of flower are generally distinguished in cultivars of herbaceous peonies.
* single: a single or double row of broad petals encircle fertile stamens, carpels visible.
* Japanese: a single or double row of broad petals encircle somewhat broadened staminodes, may carry pollen along the edges, carpels visible.
* anemone: a single or double row of broad petals encircle narrow incurved petal-like staminodes; fertile stamens are absent, carpels visible.
* triple: the flower consists of triple row of broad petals that broaden and overlap each other.
* semi-double: a single or double row of broad petals encircles further broad petals intermingled with stamens.
* bomb: a single row of broad petals encircles a shorter dense pompon of narrower petals.
* double: the flower consists of many broad petals only, including those which likely are altered stamens and carpels.

=== Propagation ===
Herbaceous and Itoh peonies are propagated by root division, and sometimes by seed. Tree peonies can be propagated by grafting, division, seed, and from cuttings, although root grafting is most common commercially.

Herbaceous peonies such as &quot;Paeonia lactiflora&quot;, will die back to ground level each autumn. Their stems will reappear the following spring. However tree peonies, such as &quot;Paeonia suffruticosa&quot;, are shrubbier. They produce permanent woody stems that will lose their leaves in winter but the stem itself remains intact above ground level.

=== Cultivars ===
The numerous peony hybrids and cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit, including:
*&#x27;Bartzella&#x27;, a double yellow-flowered Itoh (intersectional) peony
*&#x27;Coral Charm&#x27;, a semi-double salmon-pink-flowered herbaceous peony
*&quot;Paeonia&quot; × &quot;festiva&quot; &#x27;Rubra Plena&#x27;, a bomb red-flowered herbaceous peony
*&quot;Paeonia&quot; × &quot;lemoinei&quot; &#x27;High Noon&#x27;, a semi-double yellow-flowered tree peony

The American Peony Society is the International Cultivar Registration Authority for the genus, and accepts over 7,000 registered cultivars.

== Uses ==
The herb known as &quot;Paeonia&quot;, in particular the root of &quot;P. lactiflora&quot; (Bai Shao, Radix Paeoniae Lactiflorae), has been used frequently in traditional medicines of Korea, China and Japan. In Japan, &quot;Paeonia lactiflora&quot; used to be called &quot;ebisugusuri&quot; (&quot;foreign medicine&quot;). Pronunciation of 牡丹 (peony) in Japan is &quot;botan.&quot; In &quot;kampo&quot;, the Japanese adaptation of Chinese medicine, its root was used as a treatment for convulsions. It is also cultivated as a garden plant. In Japan &quot;Paeonia suffruticosa&quot; is called the &quot;King of Flowers&quot; and &quot;Paeonia lactiflora&quot; is called the &quot;Prime Minister of Flowers.&quot;

In China, the fallen petals of &quot;Paeonia lactiflora&quot; are parboiled and sweetened as a tea-time delicacy. Peony water, an infusion of peony petals, was used for drinking in the Middle Ages. The petals may be added to salads or to punches and lemonades.

== Culture ==


The peony is among the longest-used flowers in Eastern culture. Along with the plum blossom, it is a traditional floral symbol of China, where the &quot;Paeonia suffruticosa&quot; is called 牡丹 (mǔdān). It is also known as 富貴花 (fùguìhuā) &quot;flower of riches and honour&quot; or 花王 (huawang) &quot;king of the flowers&quot;, and is used symbolically in Chinese art.

In 1903, the Qing dynasty declared the peony as the national flower. Currently, the Republic of China government in Taiwan designates the plum blossom as the national flower, while the People&#x27;s Republic of China government has no legally designated national flower. In 1994, the peony was proposed as the national flower after a nationwide poll, but the National People&#x27;s Congress failed to ratify the selection. In 2003, another selection process was initiated, but no choice has been made to date.

The ancient Chinese city Luoyang has a reputation as a cultivation centre for the peonies. Throughout Chinese history, peonies in Luoyang have been said to be the finest in the country. Dozens of peony exhibitions and shows are still held there annually.

The Greek doctor Dioscorides named aglaophotis, an herb supposedly capable of warding off certain evils, as a member of the peony family.

In the Middle Ages, peonies were often painted with their ripe seed-capsules, since it was the seeds, not the flowers, which were medically significant. Ancient superstition dictated that great care be taken not to be seen by a woodpecker while picking the plant&#x27;s fruit, or the bird might peck out one&#x27;s eyes.

The red flowers of the species &quot;Paeonia peregrina&quot; are important in Serbian folklore. Known as Kosovo peonies (, ), they are said to represent the blood of Serbian warriors who died in the Battle of Kosovo.

In 1957, the Indiana General Assembly passed a law to make the peony the state flower of Indiana, a title which it holds to this day. It replaced the zinnia, which had been the state flower since 1931.

Mischievous nymphs were said to hide in the petals of the peony, giving it the meaning of Shame or Bashfulness in the Language of Flowers.

Peonies are a common subject in tattoos, often used along with koi-fish. The popular use of peonies in Japanese tattoo was inspired by the ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi&#x27;s illustrations of &quot;Suikoden&quot;, a classical Chinese novel. His paintings of warrior-heroes covered in pictorial tattoos included lions, tigers, dragons, koi fish, and peonies, among other symbols. The peony became a masculine motif, associated with a devil-may-care attitude and disregard for consequence.

Famous painters of peonies have included Conrad Gessner (ca. 1550) and Auguste Renoir in 1879. &quot;Paeonia officinalis&quot; can be found in the altar picture of &quot;Maria im Rosenhag&quot; by Schongauer in the former Dominican Church in Colmar. The Italian Jesuit, painter and architect Giuseppe Castiglione (1688-1766), who worked at the court of the Qianlong Emperor in the Qing dynasty, also painted peonies.

<text>The Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis), also known as the Laysan teal, is a dabbling duck endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. Fossil evidence reveals that Laysan ducks once lived across the entire archipelago, but today survive only on Laysan Island and two atolls. The duck has several physical and behavioral traits linked to the absence of ground-based predators in its habitat. By 1860, the ducks had disappeared from everywhere except Laysan Island. The introduction of European rabbits by guano miners at the end of the 19th century brought the bird to the brink of extinction in 1912, with twelve surviving individuals. Rabbits were eradicated from the island in 1923 and numbers of Laysan ducks began to rise, reaching 500 by the 1950s. In an effort to ensure the long-term future of this duck, 42 birds were translocated to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in 2002. These thrived in their new surroundings, and another group were later relocated to Kure Atoll.

==Taxonomy==
Named by Lionel Walter Rothschild in 1892, the Laysan duck is named after Laysan island, one of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the mallard clade of dabbling ducks, and is a highly unusual species, both behaviorally and genetically. Recent evidence suggests they originated from an east Asian, southern hemisphere ancestor of mallards, not from stray migratory mallards (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;) as had been reported in the past.

==Description==
The Laysan duck is teal-sized and dark brown, with a prominent white eye-ring. The bill is short and spatulate, dark green with variable black blotching in males, and dull orange with variable black blotching in females. The Laysan duck usually has a ring of fat around its neck. Some males show faint iridescence on the head or neck and have slightly upturned central tail feathers. The wing has an iridescent purplish-green patch (speculum feathers) in both sexes. Leucistism, or extensive white feathering, is common on the head and neck of older birds. The legs and feet are orange, usually brighter in the male. The annual pre-basic molt is complete, and the ducks lose all their flight feathers and become incapable of flight until new feathers grow in. Wild ducks have been known to live to the age of twelve years, and captive birds have lived to the age of eighteen.

==Behavior==
The Laysan duck is a poor flyer, but walks and runs well, with a pelvic girdle adapted to terrestrial foraging. Its wings and wing muscles are reduced; it prefers to freeze in place when pursued. Energetic foraging behavior includes a fly-snapping sprint through &quot;Neoscatella sexnotata&quot; brine fly swarms. With necks outstretched, and bills close to the ground, the ducks run along a mudflat and as clouds of flies rise up in front, snap them up by rapidly opening and closing their bills. The ducks also will dabble and filter feed along lake shallows, shore, and in upland vegetation for macroinvertebrates, algae, leaves, and seeds. During the day, and especially in the breeding season, they prefer to hide among the grass and shrub vegetation, helping them to avoid avian predators such as frigatebirds. They prefer to venture out in the open and feed on the lake from dusk til dawn, although there seems to be marked variation from year to year according to the availability of food items.

===Reproduction===
Pair formation begins in autumn, and nest building begins in spring. The female builds a well-concealed nest on the ground below dense vegetation, especially &quot;Eragrostis variabilis&quot; bunchgrass. The nest is a shallow bowl lined with dead grass and down feathers. Egg-laying typically occurs from April to August. Average clutch size on Laysan Island is approximately four bird egg/eggs. The newly established population on Midway lays larger clutches, presumably because of better availability of food. Ducklings are precocious and feed on their own day two after hatching, but are guarded, brooded, and led to foraging sites by the hen for approximately 40 to 60 days.

==Status and conservation==

===Decline to near-extinction===

The decline of the Laysan duck began between AD 400 and 1000, with the colonization of the Hawaiian Islands by Polynesians and associated non-native mammalian predators. By 1860, the ducks disappeared from all but Laysan Island (the duck&#x27;s namesake), most likely due to predation by introduced rats. Like many isolated island species, the Laysan duck evolved in an environment lacking mammalian predators, and is ill-suited to defend itself against non-native ground hunters, such as humans, rats, pigs, and small Asian mongooses. For example, Laysan ducks are more likely to freeze their movement rather than flush or fly when startled— a strategy well suited for cryptic defense against Hawaii&#x27;s native flying predators, but ineffective against ground predators. The Laysan duck can still fly, but not very well and not for long distances; it does not disperse between islands.

The Laysan duck found refuge through most of the nineteenth century on rat-free Laysan Island, surviving within the smallest geographic range of any duck species worldwide (). Laysan Island gained federal protection in 1909, with the establishment of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge. However, devastation of the island&#x27;s vegetation by introduced domestic rabbits brought the duck to the brink of extinction in 1912, with an all-time low population of seven adults and five juveniles.

It is also said by the Fish and Wildlife when they returned to eliminate the last of the rabbits that there was just one Laysan duck hen that still existed on the Island on a nest with broken eggs in it. By this information would pertain that all Laysan Teals are from this female and the fact they can be fertile up to 1 month after copulation.

===Recovery===

After many domestic rabbits starved and the remaining ones were eradicated by biologists in 1923, the ducks began to recover, increasing to a population of about 500 individuals by the 1950s. Congress passed the Endangered Species Preservation Act in 1966, and in 1967 the Laysan duck was declared an endangered species with federal protection. However, population bottlenecks occurred, such as the severe 1993 El Niño drought and food shortage, which reduced the number of ducks to about 100. Today, breeding and survival of the birds is closely tracked. Since 1998, a sample of birds have been fitted with unique leg bands or radio transmitters for monitoring reproductive success and survival, revealing that typically only 30% of ducklings on Laysan Island survive to fledge. In 2004, the population grew to an estimated 576 ducks.

In October 2004 and 2005, 42 Laysan ducks were translocated to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge as a collaborative effort between the United States Geological Survey and Fish and Wildlife Service to establish a second population of ducks in the wild. The creation of a second population, since disaster is unlikely to strike both atolls simultaneously, reduces the risk of extinction by random catastrophes such as drought, hurricanes, tsunamis, disease outbreaks (like avian influenza), and accidental introductions of non-native plants and animals.

The second &quot;insurance population&quot; of Laysan ducks on Midway has grown quickly, more than doubling in size within the first two years. As of January 2007, 100 ducks called Midway&#x27;s Sand and Eastern Islands home. Researchers monitoring the Midway population found that the ducks were breeding at an earlier age, and laying more eggs than birds on Laysan. This suggests that the abundant habitat and food available on Midway stimulated greater reproductive effort in the ducks, which contributes optimism for the success of this re-introduced population.

A third population has now been introduced to Kure Atoll.

===Future outlook===
The persistence of the Laysan duck into the future seems likely at present, though threats to the population remain. Threats include the introduction of non-native species, which may change vital rates, displace native species and adversely affect nesting and foraging opportunities. Devastation to vegetation could increase sedimentation of the lakes and seeps that serve as important foraging habitat. Human disturbance may impact nesting and brooding, and landing permits to the Laysan Island refuge are granted only for official or scientific purposes. Debris and contaminants washed ashore by ocean currents could pose a serious threat to the duck. Pesticide containers and oil spills have contaminated Laysan in the past. The island homes of the duck are especially vulnerable to a rise in sea level and extreme weather associated with global warming. Even a slight rise in sea level would destroy a large portion of the duck&#x27;s current habitat. The spread of parasites such as the nematode &quot;Echinuria uncinata&quot; could be extremely pathogenic, as well as the introduction of disease by migratory waterfowl along the Pacific Flyway (such as avian influenza, avian malaria, cholera, botulism and duck plague). Environmental catastrophes such as drought, severe storms, and tsunamis may decimate populations. Sea level rise and increased frequency and severity of storms are an anticipated effect of global warming and could affect the population of the Laysan duck.
A recovery plan for the Laysan duck has been developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The goal of the recovery program is to conserve and recover the species to the extent that it may be down-listed from endangered to threatened in the near future, and ultimately, that the population be healthy enough to no longer require federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. The emphasis of the recovery plan is the distribution of additional viable populations in the Laysan duck&#x27;s historical and prehistorical range. The creation of multiple populations will decrease the risk that catastrophic events will result in species extinction. The increase of population size will diminish the threats from demographic and environmental uncertainties. To achieve this goal, biologists plan to establish at least five populations on a combination of predator-free Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and predator-controlled sites on Main Hawaiian Islands. This plan includes wild translocation and the establishment of a successful captive or semi-captive breeding program using wild source eggs for reintroductions to the Main Hawaiian Islands. Additionally, the plan calls for achieving gene flow between the wild source populations through long-term inter-island translocations, and island-specific management for each population to reduce threats and improve quality of habitat. As basic criteria of the recovery plan were met, the Laysan duck was down-listed from endangered to threatened after 2019. NatureServe considers the species &quot;Critically Imperiled&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In 2023 the Laysan teal was featured on a United States Postal Service Forever stamp as part of the &quot;Endangered Species&quot; set, based on a photograph from Joel Sartore&#x27;s &quot;Photo Ark&quot;. The stamp was dedicated at a ceremony at the National Grasslands Visitor Center in Wall, South Dakota.

<text>Berkeley William Enos, (November 29, 1895 – March 14, 1976) known professionally as Busby Berkeley, was an American film director and musical choreographer. Berkeley devised elaborate musical production numbers that often involved complex geometric patterns. Berkeley&#x27;s works used large numbers of showgirls and props as fantasy elements in kaleidoscopic on-screen performances.

== Early life ==

Berkeley was born in Los Angeles, California, to Francis Enos (who died when Busby was eight) and stage actress Gertrude Berkeley (1864–1946). Among Gertrude&#x27;s friends, and a performer in Tim Frawly&#x27;s Stock company run by Busby Berkeley&#x27;s father, were actress Amy Busby from whom Berkeley gained the appellation &quot;Buzz&quot; or &quot;Busby&quot; and actor William Gillette, then only four years away from playing Sherlock Holmes. Whether he was christened Busby Berkeley William Enos, or Berkeley William Enos, with Busby&#x27;s being a nickname, is unknown – the &quot;Child&#x27;s names&quot; entry on his birth certificate is blank.

In addition to her stage work, Gertrude played mother roles in silent films while Berkeley was still a child. Berkeley made his stage début at five, acting in the company of his performing family. 

In 1917, he lived in Athol, Massachusetts, working as an advertising and sales manager. During World War I, Berkeley served in the U.S. Army as a field artillery lieutenant, drilling 1,200 soldiers in complex choreography.

==Career==
===Early years===
During the 1920s, Berkeley was a dance director for nearly two dozen Broadway musicals, including hits such as &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot;. As a choreographer, Berkeley was less concerned with the dancing skills of his chorus girls as he was with their ability to form themselves into attractive geometric patterns. His musical numbers were among the larger and better-regimented on Broadway.

His earliest film work was in Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s Eddie Cantor musicals, where he began developing such techniques as a &quot;parade of faces&quot; (individualizing each chorus girl with a loving close-up), and moving his dancers all over the stage (and often beyond) in as many kaleidoscopic patterns as possible. Berkeley&#x27;s top shot technique (the kaleidoscope again, this time shot from overhead) appeared seminally in the Cantor films, and also the 1932 Universal film &quot;Night World&quot; (where he choreographed the number &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Little Who-Zis?&quot;).

===Groundbreaking choreographer===
Berkeley&#x27;s numbers were known for starting in the realm of the stage, but quickly exceeding this space by moving into a time and place that could only be cinematic, to return to shots of an applauding audience and the fall of a curtain. He used one camera to achieve this, instead of the usual four, to retain control over his vision so no director could edit the film. As choreographer, Berkeley was allowed a certain degree of independence in his direction of musical numbers, and they were often markedly distinct from (and sometimes in contrast to) the narrative sections of the films. He often didn&#x27;t even see the other sections of the picture. The numbers he choreographed were mostly upbeat and focused on decoration as opposed to substance, some costing around $10,000 per minute more than the picture they were in. One dramatic exception was &quot;Remember My Forgotten Man&quot; from &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, which dealt with the mistreatment of World War I veterans during the Great Depression.

Berkeley&#x27;s popularity with an entertainment-hungry Depression audience was secured when he choreographed five musicals back-to-back for Warner Bros.: &quot;42nd Street&quot;, &quot;Footlight Parade&quot;, the aforementioned &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, &quot;Dames&quot;, and &quot;Fashions of 1934&quot;, as well as &quot;In Caliente&quot; and &quot;Wonder Bar&quot; with Dolores del Río. Berkeley always denied any deep significance to his work, arguing that his main professional goals were to top himself and never repeat his past accomplishments.

As the outsized musicals in which Berkeley specialized became passé, he turned to straight directing. The result was 1939&#x27;s &quot;They Made Me a Criminal&quot;, starring John Garfield. Although a success at the box office, it was the only non-musical film Berkeley directed. Berkeley had several well-publicized run-ins with MGM stars such as Judy Garland. In 1943, he was removed as director of &quot;Girl Crazy&quot; because of disagreements with Garland, but the lavish musical number &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;, which he directed, remained in the picture.

His next stop was at 20th Century-Fox for 1943&#x27;s &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot;, in which Berkeley choreographed Carmen Miranda&#x27;s &quot;Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat&quot; number. The film made money, but Berkeley and the Fox brass disagreed over budget matters. Berkeley returned to MGM in the late 1940s, where he conceived the Technicolor finales for the studio&#x27;s Esther Williams films. Berkeley&#x27;s final film as choreographer was MGM&#x27;s &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Jumbo&quot; (1962).

=== Later years===
In the late 1960s, the camp craze brought the Berkeley musicals back to the forefront, and he toured the college and lecture circuit giving talks about his career. The 75-year-old Berkeley returned to Broadway to direct a successful revival of &quot;No No Nanette&quot;, starring his old Warner Brothers colleague and &quot;42nd Street&quot; star Ruby Keeler; both played cameos in the 1970 film &quot;The Phynx&quot; the same year.

== Personal life ==

In 1937, Berkley purchased the Guasti Villa, located at 3500 W. Adams Boulevard, in the West Adams district of Los Angeles. Built in 1910, Berkley owned the home until 1944. Because of the association with Berkley, the home is now Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 478.

Berkeley was married six times. His wives included actresses Merna Kennedy, Esther Muir, the starlet Claire James, and Etta Dunn, who survived him. He was involved in an alienation of affections lawsuit in 1938 involving Carole Landis, and he was engaged to Lorraine Stein.

Berkeley drank heavily, often having martinis in his daily bath.

In September 1935, Berkeley was responsible for an automobile crash in which two people were killed and five seriously injured. Badly cut and bruised, he was brought to court on a stretcher, where &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported he heard testimony that made him wince:

&#x27;Witnesses testified that motorist Berkeley sped down Roosevelt Highway in Los Angeles County one night, changed lanes, crashing headlong into one car, sideswiped another. Some witnesses said they smelled liquor on him&#x27;.

The first two trials for second degree murder ended with hung juries; he was acquitted in a third.

After his mother died and his career began to slow, he attempted suicide, slitting his wrists and taking an overdose of sleeping pills in July 1946. He was admitted to a hospital for an extended stay, an experience which severely affected his mental state.

Berkeley died from natural causes on March 14, 1976, in Palm Springs, California at the age of 80. He is buried in the Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.

==Legacy==
Berkeley was inducted into the National Museum of Dance&#x27;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1988.

<text>Marc Andrew &quot;Pete&quot; Mitscher (January 26, 1887 – February 3, 1947) was a pioneer in naval aviation who became an admiral in the United States Navy, and served as commander of the Fast Carrier Task Force in the Pacific during World War II.

==Early life and career==
Mitscher was born in Hillsboro, Wisconsin, on January 26, 1887, the son of Oscar and Myrta (Shear) Mitscher. Mitscher&#x27;s grandfather, Andreas Mitscher (1821–1905), was a German immigrant from Traben-Trarbach. His other grandfather, Thomas J. Shear, was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. During the western land boom of 1889, when Marc was two years old, his family resettled in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where his father, a federal Indian agent, later became that city&#x27;s second mayor. His uncle, Byron D. Shear, would also become mayor.

Mitscher attended elementary and secondary schools in Washington, D.C. He received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1904 through Bird Segle McGuire, then U.S. Representative from Oklahoma.

An indifferent student with a lackluster sense of military deportment, Mitscher&#x27;s career at the naval academy did not portend the accomplishments he would achieve later in life. Nicknamed after Annapolis&#x27;s first midshipman from Oklahoma, Peter Cassius Marcellus Cade, who had &quot;bilged-out&quot; in 1903, upperclassmen compelled young Mitscher to recite the entire name as a hazing. Soon he was referred to as &quot;Oklahoma Pete&quot;, with the nickname shortened to just &quot;Pete&quot; by the winter of his youngster (sophomore) year.

Having amassed 159 demerits and showing poorly in his class work, Mitscher was saddled with a forced resignation at the end of his sophomore year. At the insistence of his father, Mitscher re-applied and was granted reappointment, though he had to re-enter the academy as a first year plebe.

This time the stoic Mitscher worked straight through, and on June 3, 1910, he graduated 113th out of a class of 131. Following graduation he served two years at sea aboard , and was commissioned ensign on March 7, 1912. In August 1913, he served aboard on the West Coast. During that time Mexico was experiencing a political disturbance, and &quot;California&quot; was sent to protect U.S. interests and citizens. He married Frances Smalley on January 16, 1913. 

=== Naval aviation ===

Mitscher took an early interest in aviation, requesting a transfer to aeronautics while aboard &quot;Colorado&quot; in his last year as a midshipman, but his request was not granted. After graduating he continued to make requests for transfer to aviation while serving on the destroyers and . Mitscher was in charge of the engine room on USS &quot;Stewart&quot; when orders to transfer to the Naval Aeronautic Station in Pensacola, Florida, came in.

Mitscher was assigned to the armored cruiser , which was being used to experiment as a launching platform for aircraft. The ship had been fitted with a catapult over her fantail. Mitscher trained as a pilot, earning his wings and the designation Naval Aviator. Mitscher was one of the first naval aviators, receiving No. 33 on June 2, 1916. Almost a year later, on April 6, 1917, he reported to the renamed armored cruiser for duty in connection with aircraft catapult experiments. During World War I, the Navy established Naval Air Station Montauk in August, 1917, commanded by LT Marc Mitscher. Reconnaissance dirigibles, an airplane, troops and Coast Guard personnel were stationed at Montauk L.I. New York.

At this early date the Navy was interested in using aircraft for scouting purposes and as spotters for direction of their gunnery. Lieutenant Mitscher was placed in command of NAS Dinner Key in Coconut Grove, Florida. Dinner Key was the second largest naval air facility in the U.S. and was used to train seaplane pilots for the Naval Reserve Flying Corps. On July 18, 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant commander. In February 1919, he transferred from NAS Dinner Key to the Aviation Section in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, before reporting to Seaplane Division 1.

==Interwar assignments (1919–1939)==
=== Transatlantic crossing ===

On May 10, 1919, Mitscher was among a group of naval aviators attempting the first transatlantic crossing by air. Among the men involved were fellow future admirals Jack Towers, Albert C. Read and Patrick N. L. Bellinger. Mitscher piloted NC-1, one of three Curtiss NC flying boats that attempted the flight, under the command of Bellinger. Taking off from Newfoundland, he nearly reached the Azores before heavy fog caused loss of the horizon, making flying in the early aircraft extremely dangerous. What appeared to be fairly calm seas at altitude turned out to be a heavy chop, and a control cable snapped while setting the aircraft down. Mitscher and his five crewmen were left to sit atop the upper wing of their &quot;Nancy&quot; while they waited to be rescued. Of the three aircraft making the attempt, only NC-4 under command of Read successfully completed the crossing. For his part in the effort Mitscher received the Navy Cross, the citation reading:

&quot;&quot;For distinguished service in the line of his profession as a member of the crew of the Seaplane NC-1, which made a long overseas flight from New Foundland to the vicinity of the Azores, in May 1919&quot;.&quot;
Mitscher was also made an officer of the Order of the Tower and Sword by the Portuguese government on June 3, 1919.

On October 14, 1919, Mitscher reported for duty aboard , a minelayer refitted as an &quot;aircraft tender&quot; that had been used as a support ship for the &quot;Nancys&#x27; &quot; transatlantic flight. He served under Captain Henry C. Mustin, another pioneering naval aviator. &quot;Aroostook&quot; was assigned temporary duties as flagship for the Air Detachment, Pacific Fleet. Mitscher was promoted to commander on July 1, 1921. In May 1922, he was detached from Air Squadrons, Pacific Fleet (San Diego, California) to command Naval Air Station Anacostia, D.C.

=== Service debates in Washington===
After six months in command at Anacostia he was assigned to a newly formed department, the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics. Here as a young aviator he assisted Rear Admiral William Moffett in defending the Navy&#x27;s interest in air assets. General Billy Mitchell was advancing the idea that the nation was best defended by an independent service which would control all military aircraft. Though Mitscher was not a vocal member of the Navy&#x27;s representatives, his knowledge of aircraft capabilities and limitations was instrumental in the Navy being able to answer Mitchell&#x27;s challenge and retain their own airgroups. The debate culminated in the hearings before the Morrow Board, convened to study the best means of applying aviation to national defense. Mitscher testified before the board on October 6, 1925. General Mitchell sought public support for his position by taking his case directly to the people through the national press. For this action Mitchell was summoned for a court-martial. One of the witnesses called by the prosecution was Mitscher. In the end the Navy was left with its own air resources, and was allowed to continue to develop its own independent aviation branch.

=== Development of the carrier air arm ===
Over the next two decades Mitscher worked to develop naval aviation, taking assignments serving on the aircraft carriers and , the seaplane tender , and taking command of Patrol Wing 1, in addition to a number of assignments ashore. &quot;Langley&quot; was the navy&#x27;s first aircraft carrier. A converted collier, she could only make , thus limiting her ability to generate wind over her flight deck and lift under the wings of her aircraft for launching and recovery. Aboard &quot;Langley&quot; Mitscher and other naval aviation pioneers developed many of the methods by which aircraft would be handled aboard U.S. Navy aircraft carriers. Many of these techniques continue to be used in the current-day U.S. Navy.

During this period Mitscher was assigned command of the air group for the newly commissioned aircraft carrier &quot;Saratoga&quot;. Mitscher was the first person to land an airplane onto the flight deck of &quot;Saratoga&quot; as he brought his air group aboard. The vessel conducted mock attacks against the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor in a series of Fleet Problem exercises. The key lesson learned by the naval aviation officers during these exercises was the importance to locate and destroy the other side&#x27;s flight decks as early as possible, while still preserving your own. In 1938, Mitscher was promoted to captain.

==World War II==

Between June 1939 and July 1941, Mitscher served as assistant chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics.

===Carrier commander===
Mitscher&#x27;s next assignment was as captain of the , being fitted out at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia. Upon her commissioning in October 1941, he assumed command, taking &quot;Hornet&quot; to the Naval Station Norfolk for her training out period. She was there in Virginia when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Newest of the Navy&#x27;s fleet carriers, Mitscher worked hard to get ship and crew ready for combat. Following her shake-down cruise in the Caribbean, Mitscher was consulted on the possibility of launching long-range bombers off the deck of a carrier. In April 1942, after affirming it could be done, the sixteen B-25 bombers of the Doolittle Raid were loaded on deck aboard &quot;Hornet&quot; for a transpacific voyage while &quot;Hornet&quot;″s own flight group was stored below deck in her hangar. &quot;Hornet&quot; rendezvoused with and Task Force 16 in the mid-Pacific just north of Hawaii. Under the command of Admiral Halsey, the task force proceeded in radio silence to a launch point from Japan. &quot;Enterprise&quot; provided the air cover for both aircraft carriers while &quot;Hornet&quot;″s flight deck was taken up ferrying the B-25s. &quot;Hornet&quot;, then, was the real life &quot;Shangri-la&quot; that President Roosevelt referred to as the source of the B-25s in his announcement of the bombing attack on Tokyo.

===Battle of Midway===

During the Battle of Midway, 4–7 June 1942, &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; carried the air groups that made up the strike force of Task Force 16, while carried the aircraft of Task Force 17. Mitscher had command of the newest carrier in the battle and had the least experienced air group. As the battle unfolded, the Japanese carrier force was sighted early on June 4 at 234 degrees and about from Task Force 16, sailing on a northwest heading. In plotting their attack there was strong disagreement among the air group commanders aboard &quot;Hornet&quot; as to the best intercept course. Lieutenant Commander Stanhope C. Ring, in overall command of &quot;Hornet&quot;″s air groups, chose a course of 263 degrees, nearly true west, as the most likely solution to bring them to the Japanese carrier group. He had not anticipated the Japanese turning east into the wind while they recovered their aircraft. Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron, in command of the torpedo bombers of Torpedo Eight, strongly disagreed with Ring&#x27;s flight plan. An aggressive aviator, he assured Mitscher he would get his group into combat and deliver their ordnance, no matter the cost.

Thirty minutes after the &quot;Hornet&quot; airgroups set out, Waldron broke away from the higher flying fighters and dive bombers, coming to a course of 240 degrees. This proved to be an excellent heading, as his Torpedo Eight squadron flew directly to the enemy carrier group&#x27;s location &quot;as though on a plumb line&quot;. They did so with no supporting fighters. On their way Torpedo Eight was picked up by &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s VF-6 fighter squadron flying several thousand feet above them. This group had launched last off &quot;Enterprise&quot; and had not been able to catch up with or locate the &quot;Enterprise&quot; dive bombers, but when Waldron dropped his group down to the deck to prepare for their attack the &quot;Enterprise&quot; fighters lost sight of them, leaving Torpedo Eight on their 
own. 

The first of the carrier squadrons to locate the Japanese carriers, Waldron bore down upon the enemy. He brought his group in low, slowing for their torpedo drops. With no fighter escort and no other attackers on hand to split the defenders, his group was devastated by defending Japanese Zeros flying combat air patrol (CAP). All fifteen TBD Devastators of VT-8 were shot down. Though not known at the time, the efforts of Torpedo Eight failed to deliver a hit on the Japanese carriers. Of the Torpedo Eight aircrews, only Ensign George H. Gay, Jr. survived. About twenty minutes later &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s Torpedo Six made their own attack, and was met with a similar hot reception. Again, no torpedo hits were made, but five of the aircraft managed to survive the engagement. Though failing to inflict any damage, the torpedo attacks did pull the Japanese CAP down and northeast of the carrier force, leaving the approach from other angles unhindered.

SBD dive bombers from &quot;Enterprise&quot; arriving from the south flew over the Japanese carrier force to reach their tipping points almost unopposed. They delivered a devastating blow to and managed to put a bomb into as well, while SBDs coming from the east from &quot;Yorktown&quot; dove down upon and shattered her flight deck. All three ships were set ablaze, knocked out of the battle to sink later that day. While these attacks were in progress, Ring continued his search on a course of 260 degrees, flying to the north of the battle. Unable to find the enemy and running low on fuel, &quot;Hornet&quot;″s strike groups eventually turned back, either toward &quot;Hornet&quot; or to Midway Island itself. All ten fighters in the formation ran out of fuel and had to ditch at sea. Several of her SBDs heading to Midway also ran out of fuel and had to ditch on their approach to the Midway base. Other SBDs attempting to return to &quot;Hornet&quot; were unable to locate her, and disappeared into the vast Pacific. All these aircraft were lost, though a number of the pilots were later rescued. Of &quot;Hornet&quot;″s air groups, only Torpedo Eight ended up reaching the enemy that morning. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s air groups suffered a 50 percent loss rate without achieving any combat results.

The battle was a great victory and Mitscher congratulated his crew for their efforts, but &quot;Hornet&quot;″s performance had not lived up to his expectations and he felt he had failed to deliver the results he should have. In addition, he felt great regret for the loss of John Waldron and Torpedo Eight. For the next three years he would try to secure the award of the Medal of Honor to the entire unit, but without success. The pilots of Torpedo Eight were eventually awarded the Navy Cross.

Mitscher&#x27;s decisions in the battle have come under scrutiny largely due to the questionable actions of his subordinates and discrepancies in his After Action report. According to author Robert J. Mrazek, Mitscher backed up Ring&#x27;s decision to take the heading of 263 degrees, as well as the decision to keep the fighters at high altitude, too high to effectively cover the torpedo bombers. Mrazek states that Waldron vehemently protested both decisions in front of Ring and Mitscher, but was overruled by the latter. At the time, American intelligence reports indicated that the Japanese might be operating their carriers in two groups, and the search plane contact report stated that only two carriers had been found. Mitscher and Ring had agreed on the westerly heading in order to search behind the enemy task force for a possible trailing group. A further controversy exists in that the only official report from &quot;Hornet&quot; states that the strike took a course heading of 239 degrees and missed the Japanese task force because it had turned north. This statement does not agree with some testimonies of Air Group Eight pilots and other evidence, most noticeably that none of the downed VF 10 pilots who were later rescued were found along the 238 course heading. Finally, the fact that no After Action reports were filed other than the one signed by Mitscher containing the 239 course heading is unusual. Mrazek believes that the lack of reports indicates a cover-up, possibly in an effort to protect Mitscher&#x27;s reputation.

===Commander Air Solomon Islands===
Prior to the Midway operation Mitscher had been promoted to rear admiral in preparation for his next assignment, the command of Patrol Wing 2. Though Mitscher preferred to be at sea, he held this command until December when he was sent to the South Pacific as Commander Fleet Air, Nouméa. Four months later in April 1943, Halsey moved Mitscher up to Guadalcanal, assigning him to the thick of the fight as Commander Air, Solomon Islands (COMAIRSOLS). Here Mitscher directed an assortment of Army, Navy, Marine and New Zealand aircraft in the air war over Guadalcanal and up the Solomon chain. Said Halsey: &quot;I knew we&#x27;d probably catch hell from the Japs in the air. That&#x27;s why I sent Pete Mitscher up there. Pete was a fighting fool and I knew it.&quot; Short on aircraft, fuel and ammunition, the atmosphere on Guadalcanal was one of dogged defense. Mitscher brought a fresh outlook, and instilled an offensive mindset to his assorted air commands. Mitscher later said this assignment managing the constant air combat over Guadalcanal was his toughest duty of the war.

===Battles for the Central Pacific===

Returning to the Central Pacific as commander, Carrier Division 3, Mitscher was given primary responsibility for the development and operations of a newly formed Fast Carrier Task Force, at that time operating as Task Force 58 as part of Admiral Raymond Spruance&#x27;s Fifth Fleet. To that point in the conflict carriers had been able to bring enough airpower to bear to inflict significant damage on opposing naval forces, but they always acted as a raiding group against land bases. They would approach their objective, inflict damage, and then escape into the vast reaches of the Pacific. Even the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, devastating though it was, was a carrier raid. Naval airpower was not thought to have the capacity to challenge land-based airpower over any length of time. Mitscher was about to change that, leading U.S. naval airpower into a new realm of operations.

The fleet had recently completed operations in the Gilbert Islands, taking Tarawa in a bloody and costly invasion in the process. This mission was done for the purpose of obtaining a land base for aircraft to support naval operations against the next objective, the Marshall Islands. The idea that land-based air support was necessary to successfully conduct an amphibious operation was traditional doctrine. The Marshalls would be the first key step in the Navy&#x27;s march across the Pacific to reach Japan. Mitscher&#x27;s objective was to weaken Japanese air defenses in the Marshalls and limit their capability of flying in reinforcements, in preparation for a U.S. invasion of the Marshalls, code named Operation Flintlock. Intelligence estimates of the Japanese defenders of the Marshall Islands believed they had approximately 150 aircraft at their disposal. Two days before the intended landings Mitscher&#x27;s task groups approached to within of the Marshalls and launched their air strikes, fighters first to soften up the defenders, followed by bombers to destroy ground emplacements, buildings, supplies, and the defenders&#x27; airfields. It was thought it would take two days to attain air superiority. Though the Japanese battled briskly, they lost control of the skies over the Marshall Islands by noon of the first day. What came next was an aerial bombardment of the Japanese defenses, followed by a naval bombardment from the big guns of Spruance&#x27;s surface force. The two days of destruction saved a great many lives of the Marines that were landed. The Japanese were estimated to have lost 155 aircraft. Mitscher&#x27;s task force lost 57 aircraft, from which 31 pilots and 32 crewmen were lost. But the manner in which the fast carrier task force was employed established a pattern for future Pacific operations. In his summary report for the month of January, Admiral Nimitz commented it was &quot;typical of what may be expected in the future.&quot;

Next, Mitscher led Task Force 58 in a raid against Truk, Satawan and Ponape (February 17–18). This was a big step up. The idea of purposely sailing into the range of a major Japanese naval and air base brought great unease to Mitscher&#x27;s airmen. Said one: &quot;They announced our destination over the loudspeaker once we were underway. It was Truk. I nearly jumped overboard.&quot; But Mitscher felt confident they could succeed. As tactical commander of the striking force, he developed techniques that would help give his airmen the edge of surprise. In Operation Hailstone, Mitscher&#x27;s forces approached Truk from behind a weather front to launch a daybreak raid that caught many of the defenders off guard. The airmen brought devastation to the heavily defended base, destroying 72 aircraft on the ground and another 56 in the air, while a great number of auxiliary vessels and three warships were sunk in the lagoon. Chuckling over the pre-raid fears, Mitscher commented, &quot;All I knew about Truk was what I&#x27;d read in the &quot;National Geographic&quot;.&quot;

Through the spring of 1944 Task Force 58 conducted a series of raids on Japanese air bases across the Western Pacific, first in the Mariana and Palau Islands, followed by a raid against Japanese bases in the Hollandia area. These attacks demonstrated that the air power of Task Force 58 was great enough to overwhelm the air defenses of not just a single island air base, or several bases on an island, but the air bases of several island groups at one time. The long-held naval rule that fleet operations could not be conducted in the face of land-based air power was brushed aside.

In the ensuing year Mitscher&#x27;s aviators devastated Japanese carrier forces in the Battle of the Philippine Sea—also known as the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;—during June 1944. Memorably, when a very long-range U.S. Navy follow-up strike had to return to their carriers in darkness, Mitscher ordered all the carriers&#x27; flight deck landing lights turned on, risking submarine attack to give his aviators the best chance of being recovered.

On 26 August 1944, when Admiral William Halsey relieved Admiral Raymond Spruance as the fleet commander, the ships of the Fifth Fleet became the Third Fleet, and the subordinate Fast Carrier Task Force 58 became Task Force 38. The redesignated task force remained commanded by Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher. One of the most unfortunate events of the Pacific war occurred on the morning of 21 September 1944, when spotter planes from one of TF 38&#x27;s carriers came across the MATA-27 convoy and a full scale attack soon was launched. All eleven ships were sunk, including the &quot;Toyofuku Maru&quot;, which received direct hits from two aerial torpedoes and three bombs, sinking within five minutes; unfortunately, the &quot;Toyofuku Maru&quot; was carrying Dutch and British prisoners of war below decks, of which 1,047 drowned. This was learned only after the war&#x27;s end.

===Facing the kamikaze threat===

During 1944 and 1945, Vice Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s fast carriers, whether designated Task Force 38 or Task Force 58, spearheaded the thrust against the heart of the Japanese Empire, covering successively the invasion of the Palaus, the liberation of the Philippines, and the conquests of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. On 26 January 1945, the Third Fleet again became the Fifth Fleet. During the Okinawa operation there was a weather-caused delay in the Army preparing serviceable air bases. To provide essential air support to the intense ground operations, Mitscher was obliged to keep then-Task Force 58 sailing in a box on station some east of Okinawa, often in stormy weather and heavy seas, for the next two months. During this time they were subject to air attack around the clock, and the psychological pressures of warding off these attacks were enormous. Rarely did a night go by that all the ships&#x27; crews were not called to general quarters, and the days were worse. Mitscher won his second Navy Cross for the critical success of TF 38 over the period of October 22–30, 1944, both away from and also in direct support of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. He won his third Navy Cross for the critical success of TF 58 over the period of January 27 – May 27, 1945, both away from and also in direct support of the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.

On 11 May 1945 Mitscher&#x27;s flagship was struck by kamikazes, knocking her out of the operation and causing much loss of life. Half of Mitscher&#x27;s staff officers were killed or wounded, and Mitscher was forced to shift his command to &quot;Enterprise&quot;. &quot;Enterprise&quot; at that time was functioning as a &quot;night carrier,&quot; launching and recovering her aircraft in the dark to protect the fleet against land-based Japanese bomber and torpedo aircraft slipping in to attack the fleet in the relative safety of night. When &quot;Enterprise&quot; too was struck by a kamikaze attack, Mitscher had to transfer once more, this time to , the carrier that earlier had been damaged by a long-range kamikaze attack at Ulithi. Throughout this period Mitscher repeatedly led the fast carriers northward to attack air bases on the Japanese home islands. On 27 May 1945, Halsey for the last time relieved Spruance as fleet commander; the next day Vice Admiral John S. McCain relieved Vice Admiral Mitscher as Commander, Task Force 38. Commenting on Admiral Mitscher upon his return from the Okinawa campaign, Admiral Nimitz said, &quot;He is the most experienced and most able officer in the handling of fast carrier task forces who has yet been developed. It is doubtful if any officer has made more important contributions than he toward extinction of the enemy fleet.&quot; Exhausted and ill after a heart attack, Mitscher went to Washington, D.C., to serve as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air.

==Post-war==
At the conclusion of World War II, and in the face of markedly reduced U.S. military spending, a political battle ensued in America over the need for, and the nature of, a post-war military, with advocates from the Army Air Forces insisting that with the development of the atomic bomb the nation could be defended by the devastating power that strategic bombers could deliver, thereby doing away with the need for Army or Navy forces. In their view, air assets in the Navy should be brought under the control of the soon-to-be-formed Air Force. In the face of such proposals Mitscher remained a staunch advocate for naval aviation, and went so far as to release the following statement to the press:

Japan is beaten, and carrier supremacy defeated her. Carrier supremacy destroyed her army and navy air forces. Carrier supremacy destroyed her fleet. Carrier supremacy gave us bases adjacent to her home islands, and carrier supremacy finally left her exposed to the most devastating sky attack – the atomic fission bomb – that man has suffered.

When I say carrier supremacy defeated Japan, I do not mean air power in itself won the Battle of the Pacific. We exercised our carrier supremacy as part of a balanced, integrated air-surface-ground team, in which all hands may be proud of the roles assigned them and the way in which their duties were discharged. This could not have been done by a separate air force, exclusively based ashore, or by one not under Navy control.

By July 1946, when he was serving as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), Mitscher received, among other awards, two Gold Stars signifying his second and third Navy Cross and the Distinguished Service Medal with two Gold Stars.

He served briefly as commander 8th Fleet and on 26 September 1946 became Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, with the rank of admiral.

While in that assignment, Mitscher died on 3 February 1947 at the age of 60 of a coronary thrombosis at Norfolk, Virginia. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

== Mitscher&#x27;s style as military commander ==
Though reserved and quiet, Mitscher possessed a natural authority. He could check a man with a single question. He was intolerant of incompetence and would relieve officers who were not making the grade, but was lenient with what he would consider honest mistakes. Harsh discipline, he believed, ruined more men than it made. He was not forgetful of the abuse he took at the Naval Academy. He believed pilots could not be successfully handled with rigid discipline, as what made for a good pilot was an independence that inflexible discipline destroyed. At the same time he was insistent on rigid &quot;air discipline&quot; and he would break a man who violated it.

===Naval aviation tactics===
Before most other officers in the high command of the U.S. Navy, Mitscher had a grasp of the potential sudden, destructive power that air groups represented. The change in the operation of carriers from single or paired carriers with support vessels to task groups of three or four carriers was a Mitscher concept, which he implemented for the purpose of concentrating the fighter aircraft available for a better air defense of the carriers.

Offensively, Mitscher trained his air groups to engage in air attacks which delivered a maximum destructive force upon the enemy with the least amount of loss to his aviators. He sought well coordinated attacks. In a typical Mitscher-style air attack, fighter aircraft would come at the targets first, strafing the enemy ships to suppress their defensive anti-aircraft fire. In plain terms he intended his fighter pilots to wound or kill the target ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft gun crews. Following the fighter runs, the ordnance-carrying aircraft would execute bombing and torpedo runs, preferably simultaneously to overburden the ship&#x27;s defenses and negate evasive maneuvers. The attack would be completed in a few minutes. Once the attack was delivered the air groups would leave, as suddenly as they had arrived.

=== Leadership ===
Mitscher&#x27;s command style was one of few words. His small frame belied the authority he carried. A raised eyebrow was all he needed to indicate he was not pleased with the effort of one of his officers. He was not patient with incompetent personnel, yet he was forgiving of what he considered &quot;honest&quot; mistakes, and would allow airmen a second chance when other officers would have washed them out. He placed tremendous value on his pilots and had great respect for the risks they were willing to accept in attacking the enemy. His practice was for the flight leaders of the air groups of the carrier he was commanding from to come up to the flag bridge and report following the completion of their missions. He valued greatly the information he received from the men who had been in the air on the scene. He was devoted to these men, and made a great effort to recover as many downed aircrew as possible. One place this was demonstrated was at the Battle of the Philippine Sea, where he ordered the fleet flight decks illuminated so pilots returning in the dark and very low on fuel (many aircraft had to ditch into the sea) would have a better chance of finding the carriers, despite the risk from enemy submarines. He hated to lose a man, either adrift at sea, or worse, captured by the Japanese. Having spent time adrift on a downed aircraft himself, he was always deeply distressed that the numbers of rescued airmen were not higher.

=== Personality ===

Mitscher was a quiet man. He rarely spoke, never engaged in small talk and would never discuss mission details at the mess table. On the rare occasions when he would enter into conversation it would be about fishing, the love of which he picked up in his middle years. Mitscher relaxed by reading cheap murder mysteries, and when at sea he would always have one with him. Though he appeared distant and severe, Mitscher possessed a dry sense of humor and held a deep affection for his men. Once when a destroyer came alongside to refuel from their carrier, Mitscher took the opportunity to gently rib his chief of staff, Captain Arleigh Burke. Burke had come to Mitscher from destroyers, and preferred a fighting command over his new role as chief of staff. To the Marine sentry standing nearby, Mitscher ordered &quot;Secure Captain Burke, till that destroyer casts off.&quot;

=== Relations toward superior officers ===
Mitscher had tactical control of Task Force 58/38 and directed its subordinate task groups. Strategic control was held by Spruance or Halsey. While Spruance granted his subordinates great authority, Halsey exercised much tighter control, such that commander, Third Fleet, was for all practical purposes commander, Task Force 38 as well; this was clearly and repeatedly seen in the battle of Leyte Gulf. But however much he may have disagreed with an order, once a decision was made by either of his superiors, Mitscher would implement the decision without complaint. This was most prominently exemplified in the last two major naval battles of the war: the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. In each case Mitscher recommended a course of action which differed sharply from the one subsequently ordered by his fleet commander. In each case, once the order was given, Mitscher set about executing the order without further debate or protest.

Nevertheless, late in the war, Mitscher did preempt U.S. Fifth Fleet commander Admiral Raymond Spruance in stopping a Japanese naval sortie, centered on the super-battleship &quot;Yamato,&quot; from reaching Okinawa. Upon receiving contact reports from submarines &quot;Threadfin&quot; and &quot;Hackleback&quot; early on 7 April 1945, Spruance ordered Task Force 54, which consisted of older Standard-type battleships under the command of Rear Admiral Morton Deyo (and which were then engaged in shore bombardment of Okinawa), to prepare to intercept and destroy the Japanese sortie. Deyo began to plan how to execute his orders. Mitscher, however, preempted using the American battleship force by launching on his own initiative a massive air strike from his three carrier task groups then in range of the Japanese surface formation—without informing Spruance until after the launches were completed. As a senior naval aviation officer, &quot;Mitscher had spent a career fighting the battleship admirals who had steered the navy&#x27;s thinking for most of [that] century. One of those was his immediate superior, Raymond Spruance. Mitscher [may have] felt a stirring of battleship versus aircraft carrier rivalry. Though the carriers had mostly fought the great battles of the Pacific, whether air power alone could prevail over a surface force had not been proven beyond all doubt. Here was an opportunity to end the debate forever.&quot; After being informed of Mitscher&#x27;s launches, Spruance agreed that the air strikes could go ahead as planned. As a contingency should the air strikes not be successful, Spruance planned to assemble a force of six new fast battleships (, , , , , and ), together with seven cruisers (including the newly-arrived large cruisers and ), escorted by 21 destroyers, and to prepare for a surface engagement with &quot;Yamato.&quot; Mitscher&#x27;s air strikes sank &quot;Yamato&quot;, light cruiser &quot;Yahagi&quot;, and four destroyers (the other four fled back to Japanese ports), at the cost of ten aircraft and twelve aircrew lost.

==Legacy==
Two ships of the Navy have been named USS &quot;Mitscher&quot; in his honor: the post-World War II frigate, , later re-designated as the guided-missile destroyer (DDG-35), and the currently serving guided-missile destroyer, .

The airfield and a street at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (formerly Naval Air Station Miramar) were also named in his honor (Mitscher Field and Mitscher Way).

Mitscher Hall at the United States Naval Academy houses chaplain offices, meeting rooms, and an auditorium.

In 1989, Mitscher was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

The words of Admiral Arleigh Burke, his wartime chief of staff, provide the greatest tribute and recognition of his leadership:
: &quot;He spoke in a low voice and used few words. Yet, so great was his concern for his people—for their training and welfare in peacetime and their rescue in combat—that he was able to obtain their final ounce of effort and loyalty, without which he could not have become the preeminent carrier force commander in the world. A bulldog of a fighter, a strategist blessed with an uncanny ability to foresee his enemy&#x27;s next move, and a lifelong searcher after truth and trout streams, he was above all else—perhaps above all other—a Naval Aviator.&quot;

The character Pete Richards, played by Walter Brennan, in the 1949 film Task Force is loosely based on Mitscher.

<text>A governor, or speed limiter or controller, is a device used to measure and regulate the speed of a machine, such as an engine.

A classic example is the centrifugal governor, also known as the Watt or fly-ball governor on a reciprocating steam engine, which uses the effect of inertial force on rotating weights driven by the machine output shaft to regulate its speed by altering the input flow of steam.

== History ==
Centrifugal governors were used to regulate the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills since the 17th century. Early steam engines employed a purely reciprocating motion, and were used for pumping water – an application that could tolerate variations in the working speed.

It was not until the Scottish engineer James Watt introduced the &quot;rotative&quot; steam engine, for driving factory machinery, that a constant operating speed became necessary. Between the years 1775 and 1800, Watt, in partnership with industrialist Matthew Boulton, produced some 500 rotative beam engines. At the heart of these engines was Watt&#x27;s self-designed &quot;conical pendulum&quot; governor: a set of revolving steel balls attached to a vertical spindle by link arms, where the controlling force consists of the weight of the balls.

The theoretical basis for the operation of governors was described by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868 in his seminal paper &#x27;On Governors&#x27;.

Building on Watt&#x27;s design was American engineer Willard Gibbs who in 1872 theoretically analyzed Watt&#x27;s conical pendulum governor from a mathematical energy balance perspective. During his Graduate school years at Yale University, Gibbs observed that the operation of the device in practice was beset with the disadvantages of sluggishness and a tendency to over-correct for the changes in speed it was supposed to control.

Gibbs theorized that, analogous to the equilibrium of the simple Watt governor (which depends on the balancing of two torques: one due to the weight of the &quot;balls&quot; and the other due to their rotation), thermodynamic equilibrium for any work producing thermodynamic system depends on the balance of two entities. The first is the heat energy supplied to the intermediate substance, and the second is the work energy performed by the intermediate substance. In this case, the intermediate substance is steam.

These sorts of theoretical investigations culminated in the 1876 publication of Gibbs&#x27; famous work &quot;On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances&quot; and in the construction of the Gibbs’ governor. These formulations are ubiquitous today in the natural sciences in the form of the Gibbs&#x27; free energy equation, which is used to determine the equilibrium of chemical reactions; also known as &quot;Gibbs equilibrium&quot;.

Governors were also to be found on early motor vehicles (such as the 1900 Wilson-Pilcher), where they were an alternative to a hand throttle. They were used to set the required engine speed, and the vehicle&#x27;s throttle and timing were adjusted by the governor to hold the speed constant, similar to a modern cruise control. Governors were also optional on utility vehicles with engine-driven accessories such as winches or hydraulic pumps (such as Land Rovers), again to keep the engine at the required speed regardless of variations of the load being driven.

==Speed limiters==
Governors can be used to limit the top speed for vehicles, and for some classes of vehicle such devices are a legal requirement. They can more generally be used to limit the rotational speed of the internal combustion engine or protect the engine from damage due to excessive rotational speed.

===Cars===
Today, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz limit their production cars to . Certain Audi Sport GmbH and AMG cars, and the Mercedes/McLaren SLR are exceptions. The BMW Rolls-Royces are limited to . Jaguars, although British, also have a limiter, as do the Swedish Saab and Volvo on cars where it is necessary.

German manufacturers initially started the &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot;, electronically limiting their vehicles to a top speed of , since such high speeds are more likely on the Autobahn. This was done to reduce the political desire to introduce a legal speed limit.

In European markets, General Motors Europe sometimes choose to discount the agreement, meaning that certain high-powered Opel or Vauxhall cars can exceed the mark, whereas their Cadillacs do not. Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, Porsche, Aston Martin and Bentley also do not limit their cars, at least not to . The Chrysler 300C SRT8 is limited to . Most Japanese domestic market vehicles are limited to only or . The top speed is a strong sales argument, though speeds above about are not likely reachable on public roads.

Many performance cars are limited to a speed of to limit insurance costs of the vehicle, and reduce the risk of tires failing.

===Mopeds===
Mopeds in the United Kingdom have had to have a speed limiter since 1977. Most other European countries have similar rules (see the main article).

===Public services vehicles===
Public service vehicles often have a legislated top speed. Scheduled coach services in the United kingdom (and also bus services) are limited to 65 mph.

Urban public buses often have speed governors which are typically set to between and .

===Trucks===
All heavy vehicles in Europe and New Zealand have law/by-law governors that limits their speeds to or . Fire engines and other emergency vehicles are exempt from this requirement.

==Example uses==

===Aircraft===
Aircraft propellers are another application. The governor senses shaft RPM, and adjusts or controls the angle of the blades to vary the torque load on the engine. Thus as the aircraft speeds up (as in a dive) or slows (in climb) the RPM is held constant.

===Small engines===

Small engines, used to power lawn mowers, portable generators, and lawn and garden tractors, are equipped with a governor to limit fuel to the engine to a maximum safe speed when unloaded and to maintain a relatively constant speed despite changes in loading. In the case of generator applications, the engine speed must be closely controlled so the output frequency of the generator will remain reasonably constant.

Small engine governors are typically one of three types:
*Pneumatic: the governor mechanism detects air flow from the flywheel blower used to cool an air-cooled engine. The typical design includes an air vane mounted inside the engine&#x27;s blower housing and linked to the carburetor&#x27;s throttle shaft. A spring pulls the throttle open and, as the engine gains speed, increased air flow from the blower forces the vane back against the spring, partially closing the throttle. Eventually, a point of equilibrium will be reached and the engine will run at a relatively constant speed. Pneumatic governors are simple in design and inexpensive to produce. They do not regulate engine speed very accurately and are affected by air density, as well as external conditions that may influence airflow.
*Centrifugal: a flyweight mechanism driven by the engine is linked to the throttle and works against a spring in a fashion similar to that of the pneumatic governor, resulting in essentially identical operation. A centrifugal governor is more complex to design and produce than a pneumatic governor. The centrifugal design is more sensitive to speed changes and hence is better suited to engines that experience large fluctuations in loading.
*Electronic: a servo motor is linked to the throttle and controlled by an electronic module that senses engine speed by counting electrical pulses emitted by the ignition system or a magnetic pickup. The frequency of these pulses varies directly with engine speed, allowing the control module to apply a proportional voltage to the servo to regulate engine speed. Due to their sensitivity and rapid response to speed changes, electronic governors are often fitted to engine-driven generators designed to power computer hardware, as the generator&#x27;s output frequency must be held within narrow limits to avoid malfunction.

===Turbine controls===

In steam turbines, the steam turbine governing is the procedure of monitoring and controlling the flow rate of steam into the turbine with the objective of maintaining its speed of rotation as constant. The flow rate of steam is monitored and controlled by interposing valves between the boiler and the turbine.

In water turbines, governors have been used since the mid-19th century to control their speed. A typical system would use a Flyball governor acting directly on the turbine input valve or the wicket gate to control the amount of water entering the turbine. By 1930, mechanical governors started to use PID controllers for more precise control. In the later part of the twentieth century, electronic governors and digital systems started to replace mechanical governors.

===Electrical generator===

For electrical generation on synchronous electrical grids, prime movers drive electrical generators which are electrically coupled to any other generators on the grid. With droop speed control, the frequency of the entire grid determines the fuel delivered to each generator, so that if the grid runs faster, the fuel is reduced to each generator by its governor to limit the speed.

===Elevator===
Governors are used in elevators. It acts as a stopping mechanism in case the elevator runs beyond its tripping speed (which is usually a factor of the maximum speed of the lift and is preset by the manufacturer as per the international lift safety guidelines). This device must be installed in traction elevators and roped hydraulic elevators.

===Music box===
Governors are used in some wind-up music boxes to keep the music playing at a somewhat constant speed while the tension on the spring is decreasing.

<text>USS &quot;Lagarto&quot; (SS-371), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the lagarto, a lizard fish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Lagarto&quot;′s keel was laid down on 12 January 1944 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. She was launched on 28 May 1944, sponsored by Emily Taft Douglas, Congresswoman from Illinois, and later United States Senator from Illinois, and commissioned on 14 October 1944 with Commander Frank D. Latta in command. Latta was a veteran of nine war patrols and holder of the Navy Cross, earned while commanding officer of the submarine .

==Operational history==
===November–December 1944===
Floated high and dry in a floating drydock down the Mississippi River, among the islands and channels of which her captain had first &quot;felt the call of the sea&quot; as &quot;a mere youth&quot;, &quot;Lagarto&quot; departed New Orleans, Louisiana, on 12 November 1944, for Panama, escorted by the submarine chaser . Releasing her escort on 15 November, &quot;Lagarto&quot; reported to Commander, Panama Sea Frontier, to begin her shakedown two days later. Captain John G. Johns supervised the boat&#x27;s training during the period between 20 November and 5 December 1944. Sadly, during that period, on 3 December, Chief Machinist&#x27;s Mate Pat Cole died of coronary thrombosis while &quot;Lagarto&quot; lay at Saboya Anchorage, off Perlas Island, Panama.

Clearing Balboa, Canal Zone, on 9 December 1944, &quot;Lagarto&quot; reached Pearl Harbor on Christmas Day 1944. The following day, she commenced a period of training (supervised by Captain Jesse L. Hull for its duration) and a special availability. The latter saw the installation of a second  gun and replacement of the 20 mm with two 40 mm mounts, installation of additional topside ready-use lockers, eight topside mounts for .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine guns, in addition to other internal work, including the alteration of the small arms magazine to accommodate additional ammunition stowage, bringing the boat&#x27;s total capacity to 220 rounds. Additionally, a Panama Bay sound test having revealed a &quot;singing&quot; port propeller, that was replaced. The special training and availability period concluded on 23 January 1945.

===January – March 1945===
&quot;Lagarto&quot;, accompanied by , departed Pearl Harbor on 24 January 1945, escorted initially by . Releasing their escort four and a half hours out, the two boats proceeded in company, conducting dives and drills daily and acting as targets for each other on alternate days. Ultimately, the pair reached the Marianas on 4 February, exchanging recognition signals with friendly planes as they neared Saipan. Escorted in by the infantry landing craft on 5 February, &quot;Lagarto&quot; moored in a nest alongside as she lay alongside in Tanapag Harbor. &quot;Haddock&quot; moored outboard.

Tragedy struck the next day, however, when an automobile accident on Saipan resulted in serious injuries to two of &quot;Lagarto&quot;″s more experienced officers: Lieutenant Walter R. Shaw, a &quot;mustang&quot; (commissioned from the enlisted ranks) veteran of three war patrols, and Ensign Allen G. Brewington, who, like Shaw, was a mustang but a veteran of nine patrols, including one in &quot;Haddock&quot; for which he had earned the Silver Star. In addition, the mishap incapacitated three of &quot;Haddock&quot;″s officers, including Commander John P. &quot;Beetle&quot; Roach, her skipper and a Naval Academy classmate of &quot;Lagarto&quot;″s commanding officer. Consequently, Lieutenant Robert J. Williams (five war patrols) and Lieutenant, junior grade Walter B. Phelps (four war patrols) arrived by air from Guam, reporting on board &quot;Lagarto&quot; late in the forenoon watch on 7 February to replace Shaw and Brewington.

Under way during the first dog watch on 7 February 1945, escorted by the motor minesweeper , &quot;Latta&#x27;s Lancers&quot; (Task Group 17.13) formed column—&quot;Lagarto&quot;, &quot;Haddock&quot;, and —and headed for the Bonin Islands to destroy &quot;picket boats&quot; in advance of the carrier strikes planned to be launched by Task Force 38 in mid-month. Releasing &quot;YMS-426&quot; at midnight, &quot;Lagarto&quot; decoded a dispatch a little over two hours into the mid watch on 8 February, however, communicating the sad tidings that Lieutenant Shaw had died (&quot;His loss was a serious blow to the &quot;Lagarto&quot;,&quot; wrote Captain Willard J. Suits, Commander, Submarine Squadron 22, &quot;and the submarine service.&quot;) of the injuries suffered in the automobile accident on the 6th. At noon the same day (8 February), while &quot;Lagarto&quot; mourned her loss, Commander Latta informed the &quot;wolfpack&quot; that its being behind schedule would not permit coordinated practice firing.

====12 – 13 February====
Entering the assigned patrol area on 11 February 1945, &quot;Latta&#x27;s Lancers&quot; commenced searching for their quarry. A quarter of an hour into the first dog watch on 12 February, &quot;Lagarto&quot; sighted four B-29s; contacting two over her VHF (very high frequency) radio equipment, she &quot;received [the] dope on [the] picket vessels&quot; they sought. &quot;Haddock&quot; likewise obtained contact data from the Superfortresses. Thus forewarned, &quot;Haddock&quot; obtained the first radar contact an hour before the end of the first watch on 12 February; opening the range, she commenced tracking what proved to be the &quot;guard boats&quot; (converted trawlers) &quot;No.8 Kotoshiro Maru&quot; (109 tons) and &quot;No.3 Showa Maru&quot; (76 tons), neither vessel under way.

&quot;With excellent SCR (Set, Complete, Radio) communication,&quot; Commander Latta &quot;outlined [the] plan to [the] other skippers as easily as if we were in the same wardroom&quot;. He ordered &quot;Sennet&quot; to westward, maintaining contact with her SJ radar, while &quot;Lagarto&quot; kept in touch with &quot;Haddock&quot; in like fashion. With the coming of the mid watch on 13 February 1945, the Japanese craft still lay-to, &quot;apparently not alerted.&quot; Consequently, Latta ordered &quot;Haddock&quot; to break contact and his boat formed a line of bearing on &quot;Sennet&quot;. &quot;Lagarto&quot; began opening to westward at 04:15, and at 05:40 began heading in on the surface toward the last known position of &quot;No.8 Kotoshiro Maru&quot; and &quot;No.3 Showa Maru&quot;. With &quot;Sennet&quot; on the left flank and &quot;Haddock&quot; on the right, and &quot;Lagarto&quot; as guide in the center, the boats some apart, Latta planned to close to , then turn right about 50 degrees, to put the seas and wind in a most favorable position and still close the range, allocating &quot;Sennet&quot; the picket to the north, &quot;Haddock&quot; the one to the south; &quot;Lagarto&quot;, meanwhile, would direct the fire to whichever vessel &quot;appeared to be offering the most opposition.&quot;

At 06:20 on 13 February 1945, &quot;Lagarto&quot; manned her battle surface stations, and opened fire with her number one gun 12 minutes later on the clearly unsuspecting enemy that lay &quot;nicely outlined against [the] red eastern sky&quot; distant. &quot;Japs began jabbering in high gear at 4,475 KCS!&quot; Latta reported subsequently, as one of the guard boats managed to transmit a dispatch as chaos descended suddenly upon her: &quot;Gun attack by submarines in position 30-00N, 136-30E...” &quot;Lagarto&quot;″s photographer seemed elated (in a &quot;happy daze,&quot; the commanding officer reported) at the apparently photogenic aspect of the action he was recording, repeating &quot;Oh boy, Oh boy!&quot;

No such elation seized the enemy, however, who determinedly fought back against his heavier adversaries, as the action progressed, with whatever caliber weapon lay at hand. &quot;No.8 Kotoshiro Maru&quot; and &quot;No.3 Showa Maru&quot; began turning to the northward, returning fire with what appeared to be approximately &quot;40-millimeter size&quot; weapons. &quot;Lagarto&quot; recorded &quot;numerous splashes within twenty yards (18 m) of ship...&quot; &quot;Lagarto&quot;, followed by &quot;Sennet&quot; and &quot;Haddock&quot;, concentrated her fire upon &quot;No.8 Kotoshiro Maru&quot;, the leading and northerly vessel as she appeared to be laying a smoke screen to obscure her smaller sister; &quot;Haddock&quot; silenced the lead boat&#x27;s forward gun. Inside of ten minutes, the Americans&#x27; fire began to tell, as the first quarry began to burn; smoke began obscuring her from view. &quot;Haddock&quot;, meanwhile, shifted fire to &quot;No.3 Showa Maru&quot;, noting one particularly defiant Japanese sailor firing back with a rifle, while &quot;Sennet&quot;, being blanked out by &quot;Lagarto&quot;, swung left in a full circle and fell in astern of the pack commander&#x27;s boat, shifting her fire to &quot;Haddock&quot;″s target as well.

As &quot;No.3 Showa Maru&quot; began to burn, however, the smoke cleared away from the larger guard boat, revealing her still under way and full of fight. &quot;Sennet&quot; &quot;commenced hot pursuit&quot; of &quot;No.8 Kotoshiro Maru&quot;. &quot;Lagarto&quot; likewise closed the range with the larger patrol vessel, opening up with her 40-millimeter guns at ; by 06:45, &quot;No.8 Kotoshiro Maru&quot; guns had fallen silent and she wallowed in the sea, burning fiercely, while &quot;No.3 Showa Maru&quot; likewise lay in extremis. &quot;Haddock&quot;, having expended the last of her ammunition, headed for the latter, lying riddled and burning, to finish her off, but &quot;No.3 Showa Maru&quot; sank before the submariners could man her 40-millimeter guns. &quot;Haddock&quot; circled the wreckage several times &quot;to see if we could pick up any Japs or material but neither could be found.&quot; &quot;Sennet&quot; neared &quot;No.8 Kotoshiro Maru&quot;″s side &quot;to see if anything worth salvaging was left&quot;, but apparently found it &quot;too hot&quot; and pulled clear. Latta ordered her to sink the wreck. &quot;Sennet&quot; hastened &quot;No.8 Kotoshiro Maru&quot;″s demise with &quot;a couple rounds of 5&quot; from close range.&quot;

&quot;Latta&#x27;s Lancers&quot; having summarily disposed of the two guard boats (there were no survivors from either Japanese vessel) with no loss to themselves, &quot;Lagarto&quot;, &quot;Haddock&quot;, and &quot;Sennet&quot; formed a scouting line and continued their search. A little less than four hours later, a lookout in &quot;Lagarto&quot; spotted a patrolling &quot;Betty&quot; (Mitsubishi G4M Type 0 land attack plane) crossing astern, heading for &quot;Haddock&quot;; &quot;Lagarto&quot; submerged; &quot;Haddock&quot; spotted the Betty and did likewise; both boats logged the presence of explosions that, fortunately, caused no damage.

During the first dog watch on 13 February 1945, a lookout in &quot;Haddock&quot;, despite poor visibility conditions, spotted two more guard boats lying-to about distant. Sending a contact report to her two pack-mates, Haddock maintained contact as the day went on. &quot;Lagarto&quot; exchanged calls with &quot;Sennet&quot; on the SJ, and ordered that boat to close &quot;Haddock&quot;. &quot;Our choice of direction is biased&quot;, Latta later explained, &quot;neither boat [&quot;Lagarto&quot; nor &quot;Sennet&quot;] having a sight in two days&quot;. At 22:49 &quot;Lagarto&quot; contacted &quot;Haddock&quot; by the SJ. &quot;When within range of good SCR communication [such as had facilitated the destruction of &quot;No.8 Kotoshiro Maru&quot; and &quot;No.3 Showa Maru&quot;] [Latta] outlined to both skippers a plan previously proposed by Commander [George E.] Porter [Jr., &quot;Sennet&quot; commanding officer.]&quot; Since &quot;Haddock&quot; had expended the last of her ammunition in the engagement with the two pickets that morning, Latta ordered her to maintain contact while &quot;Lagarto&quot; and &quot;Sennet&quot; opened to the westward as before. Those two boats would strike at dawn with gunfire and &quot;Haddock&quot; would make a close range submerged torpedo attack. Ironically, &quot;Haddock&quot; skipper, Commander William H. Brockman, Jr., had arrived at the same solution independently.

====14 February====
&quot;Lagarto&quot; began her easterly approach for the attack at 05:50 on 14 February 1945. &quot;No likelihood of bright eastern sky today&quot;, her commanding officer later recounted, &quot;all heavy gray overcast and seas less favorable to gun firing.&quot; Going to &quot;battle surface&quot; 15 minutes later, &quot;Lagarto&quot; opened fire on the right-hand vessel at , swinging to the right to bring both of her mounts to bear, &quot;cold seas washing over [the] gun crews.&quot; The Japanese fought back more spiritedly than the day before. &quot;Return fire heavier than yesterday&quot;, Latta noted in his patrol report, &quot;but targets slower getting under way.&quot; &quot;Sennet&quot; reported numerous holes in her superstructure and one man wounded from the &quot;extremely accurate&quot; fire, but &quot;Lagarto&quot; emerged from the encounter unscathed. &quot;Haddock&quot; fired one torpedo at at one of the guard boats, but missed. &quot;Lagarto&quot; and &quot;Sennet&quot;, having expended the last of their ammunition, broke off the action by 07:00 and stood away from the scene of the action, leaving behind one guard boat, &quot;No.3 Kanno Maru&quot; (98 tons), damaged.

====20 February====
Detaching &quot;Sennet&quot; to proceed to her assigned patrol area and &quot;Haddock&quot; to hers, &quot;Lagarto&quot; proceeded to carry out the remainder of her patrol. Outside aircraft sightings on 17, 19 February and 20 February, it seemed devoid of contacts until the forenoon watch on 24 February 1945 off Okino Shima. Identifying a &quot;RO-class submarine&quot; at 10:58, &quot;Lagarto&quot; maneuvered into position and launched four torpedoes at 11:18; she logged the sound of what appeared to be an explosion on the target, and a second explosion that seemed to reflect the impact of the torpedo with an underwater cliff. Her quarry got off a report: &quot;Torpedo attack in position 32-41N., 132-36E. Damage sustained...&quot; The target&#x27;s screws appeared to stop shortly after the explosion, followed less than ten minutes later by a &quot;heavy underwater explosion like [a] collapsed hull...&quot; The identity of &quot;Lagarto&quot; victim appears to have been the Japanese submarine &quot;I-371&quot; (Lieutenant Kamijukoku Yasuo), that had departed Truk for Yokosuka on 31 January 1945. However, the credit of the 880-ton merchantman &quot;Tatsumomo Maru&quot; to &quot;Lagarto&quot; seems questionable in view of &quot;Lagarto&quot; only carrying out one attack on one target, reported as a submarine, in excellent visibility conditions. Sweeping the area with her periscope soon thereafter, &quot;Lagarto&quot; saw only empty ocean. Later that day, she heard &quot;distant, heavy depth charge explosions&quot;, prompting Latta to write: &quot;Hope &quot;Haddock&quot; is not paying for our attack...&quot;

&quot;Lagarto&quot; submerged to conduct a patrol of Van Diemen Strait the following day, 25 February 1945, and the heavy seas encountered rendered control difficult; she encountered 8–10-degree rolls at depths of between periscope observations. She conducted a submerged patrol off Bungo Suido the next day, sighting a veritable parade of guard boats similar to those encountered and destroyed less than a fortnight before. She photographed the nearest one (2,500 yards) and later, &quot;nothing following these lads&quot;, secured from battle stations. On the 27th, she encountered what she reported as a midget submarine without success. Ultimately, a few more fruitless days passed, after which she exchanged patrol areas with &quot;Haddock&quot; on 7 March.

====13 March====
Ultimately departing her patrol area on 13 March 1945, bound for Subic Bay and a refit, &quot;Lagarto&quot; shaped course for a rendezvous with &quot;Haddock&quot; the following morning. At 06:12 on 14 March, &quot;Lagarto&quot; sighted a submarine through her high periscope, and began calling &quot;Haddock&quot; on the SCR. At 06:48, however, &quot;Lagarto&quot; sighted another submarine on an opposite bearing. &quot;One of them&quot;, Latta later recounted, &quot;is probably enemy—but which?&quot;

Establishing voice communication with &quot;Haddock&quot; at 07:03 identified her as the first contact, so &quot;Lagarto&quot; advised her sister boat of the second—obviously enemy—contact. Hobbled by her number two main engine being temporarily out of commission, &quot;Lagarto&quot; (&quot;&quot;Haddock&quot; has four engines to our three&quot;, Latta lamented) directed &quot;Haddock&quot; to make an end-around and then attack once she had achieved a favorable position to do so. Tracking the enemy all morning allowed &quot;Lagarto&quot; to improve the bearing, identifying her as an &quot;I-class submarine.&quot; Decreasing the range, both American boats gained on the enemy, but &quot;&quot;Haddock&quot; found a few more turns and began to pull ahead rapidly.&quot; Latta wished Commander Brockman luck. Ultimately, however, the Japanese boat frustrated the Americans&#x27; designs, submerging and escaping both. &quot;After [a] final talk with Comdr. Brockman and mutual well-wishing&quot;, Latta wrote subsequently, &quot;[&quot;Lagarto&quot;] took departure and set course for previously assigned route to Subic Bay.&quot;

&quot;Lagarto&quot; joined her escort, an hour into the morning watch on 20 March 1945, and after anchoring for a sound test in Subic Bay, moored alongside the submarine tender to commence a refit. She returned from patrol &quot;clean and shipshape with a minimum number of material defects.&quot;

===April – May 1945===
&quot;Lagarto&quot; departed Subic Bay on 12 April 1945, bound for the South China Sea, and received orders on 27 April to patrol the outer waters of the Gulf of Siam. A little under an hour into the forenoon watch on 2 May, exchanged calls with &quot;Lagarto&quot; by SJ radar. Later, an hour into the afternoon watch on 2 May, &quot;Baya&quot; sighted a Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer and contacted him by VHF. While &quot;he had no dope for us&quot;, &quot;Baya&quot; skipper wrote later, the submarine informed the aviators of the proximity of &quot;Lagarto&quot; and . At 20:55, &quot;Baya&quot; again exchanged calls with &quot;Lagarto&quot;; less than an hour later, she slowed to take soundings, recording seven fathoms. She changed course to parallel the coast.

====2 May====
&quot;Baya&quot; SJ picked up four contacts at at 21:55 on 2 May 1945; her battle stations tracking party took their places. At 22:10, &quot;Baya&quot; sent a contact report to &quot;Lagarto&quot;. Latta responded at 22:45 that his boat was in contact with a convoy, tracking it on a base course of 310° (T), speed nine knots (17 km/h), running along the 5 to 7 fathom curve (10 m). There was one large ship, one medium, and two escorts, both of which appeared to be equipped with 10-centimeter radar. Beneath a clear, dark, sky, &quot;Baya&quot; began her attack at through the flat sea, from off the convoy&#x27;s starboard bow, setting her torpedoes to run at four feet. Soon she began encountering SJ and 10-centimeter radar interference &quot;all around the dial&quot;. Two additional contacts materialized—one turned out to be a large three-masted junk, the other proved to be &quot;Lagarto&quot;. &quot;Baya&quot;, however, soon had her hands full; as her commanding officer later reported: &quot;Jap gunnery poor but plenty of it. Tracers passing down both sides of the periscope shears and overhead...&quot; Both escort vessels—one of which &quot;Baya&quot; identified as a &quot;&quot;Shiretaka&quot;-type minelayer&quot;—gave a good account of themselves; at 23:33, &quot;Baya&quot; informed &quot;Lagarto&quot; &quot;that we had been driven off by gunfire.&quot; &quot;Baya&quot; skipper later ruminated: &quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that we came through so much gun fire without a single hit.&quot; &quot;We were in a continuous hail of lead, fire, and steel and sustained not a scratch.&quot;

====3 May====
During the mid watch on 3 May 1945, &quot;Baya&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Lagarto&quot; and their captains discussed plans. The latter&#x27;s proposed to dive on the convoy&#x27;s track to make contact at 14:00, in the middle of the afternoon watch; &quot;Baya&quot; would be 10 to further along the track, &quot;if no contact was made we [&quot;Baya&quot;] were to intercept at 20:00 at convoy’s possible 21:30 position.&quot; That having been arranged, the boats set course for their arranged stations.

At 15:00 on 3 May 1945, &quot;Baya&quot; sent the first &quot;of numerous contact reports to &quot;Lagarto&quot;.&quot; By 23:47, &quot;having sent &quot;Lagarto&quot; contact reports almost half hourly with no receipt&quot;, &quot;Baya&quot; decided to go it alone. Again, however, the Japanese escorts drove off &quot;Baya&quot; when she attacked during the mid watch on 4 May, again saving their charges from destruction.

Post-war examination of Japanese records revealed the most likely reason for &quot;Lagarto&quot; silence. One of the two escorts, the minelayer , made an attack on 3 May against a submerged submarine in of water at .

Announced as &quot;overdue from patrol and presumed lost&quot; on 10 August 1945, &quot;Lagarto&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September 1945.

==Discovery of wreck, 2005–2006==
In May 2005, a group of private deep-sea divers, led by British wreck diver Jamie MacLeod, discovered the wreck in of water in the Gulf of Thailand. The wreck is mostly intact and sitting upright on the ocean floor. During the dive, a large rupture was discovered on the port bow area, suggesting a depth charge as the catalyst to her sinking. Also observed during the dive was an open torpedo tube door, with an empty torpedo tube behind it, suggesting the possibility that &quot;Lagarto&quot; fired off a torpedo shortly before her sinking.

In June 2006, Navy divers from surveyed and photographed the wreck for six days. More evidence was seen that this is &quot;Lagarto&quot;. A pair of 5-inch gun mounts were seen on the forward and rear parts of the ship. &quot;Manitowoc&quot; was seen on the propellers providing a connection to the Manitowoc, Wisconsin, shipyard. The pictures were sent back to naval archeologists for further review. After viewing the evidence provided by the &quot;Salvor&quot; divers, it was confirmed that this was indeed &quot;Lagarto&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;Lagarto&quot; received one battle star for World War II service.

<doc id="430363" wikidata="Q15427574" url="?curid=430363" title="John Hathorne">
<text>John Hathorne (August 1641 – May 10, 1717) was a merchant and magistrate of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Salem, Massachusetts. He is best known for his early and vocal role as one of the leading judges in the Salem witch trials.

Hathorne was absent from the list of men appointed to the Court of Oyer &amp; Terminer in June 1692. That court relied heavily on the spectral evidence, examinations, interrogations, and affidavits previously conducted by Hathorne, co-signed by Jonathan Corwin, and recorded by Rev. Samuel Parris and/or Ezekiel Cheever Jr. On September 22, 1692, the date of the final eight executions, Hathorne was present at a meeting (Sewall Diary) with Stoughton and Cotton Mather to discuss using court records in a new publication designed to promote the trials. Unlike Samuel Sewall, Hathorne is not known to have repented for his actions. He was a patrilineal ancestor of writer Nathaniel Hawthorne.

==Life==
Hathorne&#x27;s father, Major William Hathorne, was among the early settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 1630s and held a number of military and political positions for several decades. John was born in Salem in August 1641; his father&#x27;s surviving records give the date as August 4, but the records of the First Church of Salem indicate he was baptized on August 2. John married in Salem, March 22, 1674/5, Ruth Gardner, granddaughter of &quot;Old Planter&quot; Thomas Gardner, a settler of Salem who arrived as part of colonization efforts funded by the Dorchester Company in 1625.

Hathorne expanded on the successes of his father in building a small empire based on land and merchant trade to England and the West Indies. In addition to lands in the Salem area he also had interests in the lands of what is now Maine. He assumed positions of authority in the town, and was appointed a justice of the peace of Essex County, and served as a member of the colony&#x27;s council of assistants (a combination of legislative upper house and high court). In this role he was called on to mediate disputes in the county&#x27;s towns, including Salem Village (present-day Danvers).

===Salem interrogations and trials===

When in early 1692 accusations of witchcraft began to circulate in Salem Village, Hathorne and magistrate Jonathan Corwin were called upon to question both accusers and accused to determine if there was cause for a trial; they were eventually joined in this task by officials from Boston, including Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth. Hathorne&#x27;s questioning of a number of individuals was characterized at the time as somewhat harsh. Historical and fictional accounts of the trials often depict him as convinced that the accused were guilty. He is noted for his questioning of Rebecca Nurse and Bridget Bishop:

:Bishop : I am no witch 
:Hathorne : Why if you have not wrote in the book, yet tell me how far you have gone? 
:Bishop : I have no familiarity with the devil. 
:Hathorne : How is it then, that your appearance doth hurt these? 
:Bishop : I am innocent. 
:Hathorne : Why you seem to act witchcraft before us by the motion of your body which seems to have influence upon the afflicted. 
:Bishop : I know nothing of it. I am innocent to a witch. I know not what a witch is. 
:Hathorne : How do you know then that you are not a witch? 
:Bishop : I do not know what you say. 
:Hathorne : How can you know, you are no witch, and yet not know what a witch is? 
:Bishop : I am clear...
:--Records of Salem witchcraft, copied from the original documents by Woodward, William Eliot, 1864

When the Special Court of Oyer and Terminer was established in May 1692, Governor Sir William Phips did not appoint Hathorne to the panel, which was headed by Lieutenant Governor William Stoughton. This panel heard trials in which 19 were convicted and executed for witchcraft. The special court was replaced in 1693 by the Superior Court of Judicature, on which Hathorne was not immediately seated; it cleared most of the accused it tried of any wrongdoing, and the few convictions it handed down were vacated by Governor Phips.

==Later years==
Later in the 1690s Hathorne followed in his father&#x27;s military footsteps and became more involved in the colonial military activities of King William&#x27;s War, leading forces in the 1696 Siege of Fort Nashwaak (present-day Fredericton, New Brunswick). He continued to be active in the colonial militia, and was promoted to colonel in 1711. He was also finally appointed to the Superior Court by Governor Joseph Dudley, a seat he held until 1711. He died in Salem in 1717, and is interred in the Old Burying Point Cemetery along with a number of his descendants.

The inscription on his tombstone reads: “Here lyes interd ye body of Colo John Hathorne Esqr Aged 76 years Who Died May ye 10th 1717.” The tombstone has been placed in a granite block to help preserve it. 
==Nathaniel Hawthorne==
John was the great-great-grandfather of Nathaniel Hawthorne (born &quot;Hathorne&quot;), author of many works, including &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; and &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot;. The latter work, set in Salem, contains allusions to the witch trials in its history of the house. Hawthorne was somewhat distressed and deeply ashamed at his ancestor&#x27;s lack of remorse over the trials. Nathaniel may have adopted the &quot;Hawthorne&quot; spelling in an effort to dissociate himself from the judge.

==In popular culture==
Hathorne is featured in Arthur Miller&#x27;s play &quot;The Crucible&quot; (and its film adaptations). Robert Breuler portrays him in &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1996 film).

Hathorne is the judge appointed by Mr. Scratch at the trial in Stephen Vincent Benét&#x27;s story &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;, where he is described as &quot;a tall man, soberly clad in Puritan garb, with the burning gaze of the fanatic.&quot; In the 1941 film version, he was portrayed by H.B. Warner. In Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s play &quot;Giles Corey of the Salem Farms&quot;, Hathorne is shown debating Cotton Mather on the nature of witchcraft and presiding over hearings in which Giles Corey refuses to enter a plea (in both the real trial and Longfellow&#x27;s work, Corey was crushed to death for this refusal).

The horror film &quot;The Lords of Salem&quot; features a witch-hunting reverend named John Hawthorne.

Hathorne is featured in Alice Hoffman&#x27;s book &quot;Magic Lessons&quot; (prequel to &quot;Practical Magic&quot;), where the protagonist Maria Owens first meets him in Curaçao, West Indies and later in Salem, Massachusetts.

<text>The swan goose (Anser cygnoides) is a large goose with a natural breeding range in inland Mongolia, Northeast China, and the Russian Far East. It is migratory and winters mainly in central and eastern China. Vagrant birds are encountered in Japan and Korea (where it used to winter in numbers when it was more common), and more rarely in Kazakhstan, Laos, coastal Siberia, Taiwan, Thailand and Uzbekistan.

While uncommon in the wild, this species has been extensively domesticated, when it is known as Chinese goose. Introduced and feral populations of its domestic breeds occur in many places outside its natural range. The wild form is also kept in collections, and escapes are not unusual amongst feral flocks of other &quot;Anser&quot; and &quot;Branta&quot; geese. 

==Taxonomy==
The swan goose was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas cygnoid.&quot; The original spelling of &quot;&quot;cygnoid.&quot; (with a fullstop, suggesting an abbreviation) is widely treated as an orthographic error to be corrected to &quot;cygnoides&quot;&quot;, but some authors regard &quot;cygnoid&quot; (without the fullstop) to be the correct original spelling which should be used, citing the comparable case, universally accepted, of the spelling of the name &quot;Estrilda astrild&quot;. As of early 2025, this dispute over the spelling remains unresolved.

It is now one of 11 species placed in the genus &quot;Anser&quot; that was described by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The specific epithet combines the Latin &quot;cygnus&quot; meaning &quot;swan&quot; with Ancient Greek &quot;-oidēs&quot; meaning &quot;resembling&quot;. The species is monotypic, with no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

The swan goose is large and long-necked for its genus, wild birds being long (the longest &quot;Anser&quot; goose) and weighing or more (the second-heaviest &quot;Anser&quot;, after the greylag goose &quot;A. anser&quot;). The sexes are similar, although the male is larger, with a proportionally longer bill and neck; in fact the largest females are barely as large as the smallest males. Typical measurements of the wing are in males, in females; the bill is about long in males and in females. The tarsus of males measures around . The wingspan of adult geese is .
The upperparts are greyish-brown, with thin light fringes to the larger feathers and a maroon hindneck and cap (reaching just below the eye). The remiges are blackish, as are the entire underwing and the white-tipped rectrices, while the upper- and undertail coverts are white. A thin white stripe surrounds the bill base. Apart from darker streaks on the belly and flanks, the underside is pale buff, being especially light on the lower head and foreneck which are sharply delimited against the maroon. In flight, the wings appear dark, with no conspicuous pattern. Uniquely among its genus, the long, heavy bill is completely black; the legs and feet, on the other hand, are orange as in most of its relatives. The eyes&#x27; irides are maroon. Juveniles are duller than adult birds, and lack the white bill base and dark streaks on the underside.

The voice is a loud, drawn-out and ascending honking &quot;aang&quot;. As a warning call, a similar but more barking honk is given two or three times in short succession.

The karyotype of the swan goose is 2n=80, consisting of four pairs of macrochromosomes, 35 pairs of microchromosomes, and a pair of sex chromosomes. The two largest macrochromosome pairs as well as the Z (female) chromosome are submetacentric, while the third-largest chromosome pair is acrocentric and the fourth-largest is metacentric. The W chromosomes are acrocentric too, as are the larger microchromosomes, the smaller ones probably being telocentric. Compared to the greylag goose, there seems to have been some rearrangement on the fourth-largest chromosome pair.

==Ecology==
It inhabits steppe to taiga and mountain valleys near freshwater, grazing on plants such as sedges (Cyperaceae), grasses (Poaceae) and water plants, and rarely swimming. It forms small flocks outside the breeding season. In the winter, it grazes on plains and stubble fields, sometimes far from water. Birds return from the winter quarters around April, and the breeding season starts soon thereafter. It breeds as single pairs or loose groups near marshes and other wetlands, with nesting activity starting about May. The clutch is usually 5–6 but sometimes up to 8 eggs, which are laid in a shallow nest made from plants, placed directly on the ground, often on a small knoll to keep it dry. The precocial young hatch after about 28 days and become sexually mature at 2–3 years of age. Around late August/early September, the birds leave for winter quarters, where they gather in small groups to moult their worn plumage.

The swan goose was uplisted from Near Threatened to Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1992 and further to Endangered in 2000, as its population is declining due to habitat loss and excessive hunting and (particularly on the Sanjiang Plain in China) egg collecting. But new research has shown it to be not as rare as it was believed, and consequently, it was downlisted to Vulnerable status again in 2008. Still, less than 500 pairs might remain in Russia, while in Mongolia numbers are unknown, though about 1,000 were seen at Ögii Lake in 1977. Important wintering locations in China are Lake Dongting, Lake Poyang, the Yancheng Coastal Wetlands and other locations around the lower Yangtze River, where some 60,000 individuals may be found each year – though this may be almost the entire world population. Until the 1950s, the species wintered in small numbers (up to about 100 birds annually) in Japan, but habitat destruction has driven them away.

==Domestication==
Though the majority of domestic geese are descended from the greylag goose (&quot;A. anser&quot;), two breeds are direct descendants of the swan goose, the Chinese goose and the African goose. These breeds have been domesticated since at least the mid-18th century – perhaps even (in China) since around 1000 BC. They vary considerably from their wild parent in appearance, temperament, and ability to produce meat and eggs; the most conspicuous feature is the prominent bill knob and upright posture.

Charles Darwin studied goose breeds as part of his work on the theory of evolution. He noted that the external differences between Chinese geese and breeds descended from the Greylag goose belied a rather close relationship:
&quot;The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (&quot;A. cygnoides&quot;), species which are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera, have often bred in this country with either pure parent, and in one single instance they have bred &quot;inter se&quot;.&quot;

==Conservation==
The species is currently classified as an endangered species by the IUCN based on ongoing population declines and range losses, exacerbated by recent poor breeding success and unsustainable levels of hunting. Total population was estimated as 36–43,500 individuals in 2023.

<text>The Chinese is an international breed of domestic goose, known by this name in Europe and in North America. Unlike the majority of goose breeds, it belongs to the knob geese, which derive from &quot;Anser cygnoides&quot; and are characterised by a prominent basal knob on the upper side of the bill. It originates in China, where there are more than twenty different breeds of knob goose.

== History ==

Unlike the majority of goose breeds, which derive from the greylag goose, &quot;Anser anser&quot;, the Chinese belongs to the knob geese, which derive from the swan goose, &quot;Anser cygnoides&quot;, and are characterised by a prominent basal knob on the upper side of the bill. As the name suggests, it is believed to have originated in China, where there are more than twenty different breeds of knob goose.

It was seen in Britain from the early eighteenth century if not before, and was present in the United States in the latter part of that century – George Washington is believed to have kept some on his plantation at Mount Vernon.

It was included in the revised 1873 edition of &quot;The Poultry Book&quot; by William Bernhard Tegetmeier, and was added to the &quot;Standard of Perfection&quot; of the American Poultry Association in 1874.

In the twenty-first century it is an endangered breed: it is reported to DAD-IS by seven countries – Australia, Lithuania, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Slovenia, Suriname and the UK – but none of them report population data. Population data was last reported by the United Kingdom in 2002, when there were between 150 and 1000 birds. The Livestock Conservancy in the United States lists it as watch, its third level of concern.

== Characteristics ==

It appears in two varieties: the grey or brown, with colouring similar to that of the wild &quot;Anser cygnoides&quot;, and the white. The bill and the knob are black in the grey-brown variety, and orange in the white; the shanks and feet are always orange. In birds bred for showing the neck is long and slender.

== Use ==

As a layer of eggs it is the most prolific of any breed of goose, usually laying some 50–60 eggs in a season of about five months, but sometimes reaching 100 eggs during that time. The eggs weigh about , rather less than those of other geese. Flocks of the geese may be used to guard property or to keep down weeds.

<text>Sandra Cisneros (born December 20, 1954) is an American writer. She is best known for her first novel, &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot; (1983), and her subsequent short story collection, &quot;Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories&quot; (1991). Her work experiments with literary forms that investigate emerging subject positions, which Cisneros, herself, attributes to growing up in a context of cultural hybridity and economic inequality that endowed her with unique stories to tell. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, was awarded one of 25 new Ford Foundation Art of Change fellowships in 2017, and is regarded as a key figure in Chicano literature.

Cisneros&#x27; early life provided many experiences that she later drew on, as a writer: she grew up as the only daughter in a family of six brothers, which often made her feel isolated, and the constant migration of her family, between Mexico and the United States, instilled in her the sense of &quot;always straddling two countries but not belonging to either culture.&quot; Cisneros&#x27; work deals with the formation of Chicana identity, exploring the challenges of being caught between Mexican and Anglo-American cultures, facing the misogynist attitudes present in both these cultures, and experiencing poverty. For her insightful social critique and powerful prose style, Cisneros has achieved recognition far beyond Chicano and Latino communities, to the extent that &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot; has been translated worldwide and is taught in U.S. classrooms as a coming-of-age novel.

Cisneros has held a variety of professional positions, working as a teacher, a counselor, a college recruiter, a poet-in-the-schools, and an arts administrator, and she has maintained a strong commitment to community and literary causes. In 1998, she established the Macondo Writers Workshop, which provides socially conscious workshops for writers, and in 2000, she founded the Alfredo Cisneros Del Moral Foundation, which awards talented writers connected to Texas. Cisneros currently resides in Mexico.

== Early life and education ==
Cisneros was born in Chicago, Illinois on December 20, 1954, to a family of Mexican heritage, the third of seven children. The only surviving daughter, she considered herself the &quot;odd number, in a set of men.” Cisneros&#x27;s great-grandfather had played the piano for the Mexican president and was from a wealthy background, but he gambled away his family&#x27;s fortune. Her paternal grandfather, Enrique, was a veteran of the Mexican Revolution, and he used what money he had saved to give her father, Alfredo Cisneros de Moral, the opportunity to go to college. However, after failing classes, due to what Cisneros called his &quot;lack of interest&quot; in studying, Alfredo ran away to the United States, in an effort to escape his father&#x27;s anger. While roaming the southern United States with his brother, Alfredo visited Chicago, where he met Elvira Cordero Anguiano. After getting married, the pair settled in one of Chicago&#x27;s poorest neighborhoods. Cisneros&#x27;s biographer, Robin Ganz, writes that she acknowledges her mother&#x27;s family came came from a very humble background, tracing its roots back to Guanajuato, Mexico, while her father&#x27;s was much more &quot;admirable&quot;.

Taking work as an upholsterer to support his family, Cisneros&#x27;s father began &quot;a compulsive circular migration between Chicago and Mexico City that became the dominating pattern of Cisneros&#x27; childhood.&quot; Their family was constantly moving between the two cities, which necessitated their finding new places to live, as well as schools for the children. Eventually, the instability caused Cisneros&#x27;s six brothers to pair off in twos, leaving her to define herself, as the isolated one. Her feelings of exclusion from the family were exacerbated by her father, who referred to his &quot;seis hijos y una hija&quot; (&quot;six sons and one daughter&quot;) rather than his &quot;siete hijos&quot; (&quot;seven children&quot;). Ganz notes that Cisneros&#x27;s childhood loneliness was instrumental in shaping her later passion for writing. Cisneros&#x27; one strong female influence was her mother, Elvira, who was a voracious reader and more enlightened and socially conscious than her father. According to Ganz, although Elvira was too dependent on her husband and too restricted in her opportunities to fulfill her own potential, she ensured her daughter would not suffer from the same disadvantages as she did.

Her Khara family made a down payment on their own home in Humboldt Park, a predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood on Chicago&#x27;s West Side, when she was eleven years old. This neighborhood and its characters would later become the inspiration for Cisneros&#x27; novel &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot;. For high school, Cisneros attended Josephinum Academy, a small Catholic all-girls school. Here, she found an ally in a high-school teacher who helped her to write poems about the Vietnam War. Although Cisneros had written her first poem around the age of ten, with her teacher&#x27;s encouragement, she became known for her writing throughout her high-school years. In high school, she wrote poetry and was the literary magazine editor, but according to Cisneros, herself, she did not really start writing until her first creative writing class in college, in 1974. After that, it took a while to find her own voice. She explains, &quot;I rejected what was at hand and emulated the voices of the poets I admired in books: big male voices like James Wright and Richard Hugo and Theodore Roethke, all wrong for me.&quot;

Cisneros was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree from Loyola University Chicago, in 1976, and she received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop at the University of Iowa, in 1978. At Loyola, she had an affair with a professor that she calls a “secret life [from] when I was a junior through Iowa that tormented me and that I wrote about, in my poetry.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Herlihy-Mera, Jeffrey 2020 1 https://lithub.com/sandra-cisneros-on-the-me-too-movement-narrative-voice-and-the-house-on-mango-street&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She describes the abusive relationship as “very damaging to me” and is “why my writing is always dealing with sexuality and wickedness.”

While attending the Workshop, Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential, recalling &quot;It wasn&#x27;t as if I didn&#x27;t know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn&#x27;t think it had anything to do with why I felt so much imbalance, in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn&#x27;t make sense, until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That&#x27;s when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn&#x27;t write about.&quot; She conformed to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her &quot;neighbors, the people [she] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through.&quot;

Cisneros says of this moment:

So to me it began there, and that&#x27;s when I intentionally started writing about all the things in my culture that were different from them—the poems that are these city voices—the first part of &quot;Wicked Wicked ways&quot;—and the stories in &quot;House on Mango Street&quot;. I think it&#x27;s ironic that at the moment when I was practically leaving an institution of learning, I began realizing in which ways institutions had failed me.

Drawing on Mexican and Southwestern popular culture and conversations in the city streets, Cisneros wrote to convey the lives of people she identified with. Literary critic Jacqueline Doyle has described Cisneros&#x27;s passion for hearing the personal stories that people tell and her commitment to expressing the voices of marginalized people through her work, such as the &quot;thousands of silent women,” whose struggles are portrayed in &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot;.

Five years after receiving her MFA, she returned to Loyola University-Chicago, where she had previously earned a BA in English, to work as an administrative assistant. Prior to this job, she worked in Pilsen and Little Village, predominately Mexican neighborhoods, in Chicago, and teaching high school dropouts at Latino Youth High School.

== Later life and career ==

=== Teaching ===
In addition to being an author and poet, Cisneros has held various academic and teaching positions. In 1978, after finishing her MFA degree, she taught former high-school dropouts at the Latino Youth High School in Chicago. The 1984 publication of &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot; secured her a succession of writer-in-residence posts at universities in the United States, teaching creative writing at institutions such as the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan. She was, subsequently, a writer-in-residence at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, Texas. Cisneros has also worked as a college recruiter and as an arts administrator.

=== Family ===
Cisneros currently resides in San Miguel de Allende, a city in central Mexico, but for years, she lived and wrote in San Antonio, Texas, in her briefly controversial &quot;Mexican-pink&quot; home, with &quot;many creatures little and large.&quot; In 1990, when Pilar E. Rodríguez Aranda asked Cisneros, in an interview for the &quot;Americas Review,&quot; why she has never married or started a family, Cisneros replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen a marriage that is as happy as my living alone. My writing is my child, and I don&#x27;t want anything to come between us.&quot; She has elaborated, elsewhere, that she enjoys living alone, because it gives her time to think and write. In the introduction to the third edition of Gloria E. Anzaldúa&#x27;s &quot;Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza&quot;, Cisneros wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s why I moved from Illinois to Texas. So that the relatives and family would allow me the liberty to disappear into myself. To reinvent myself, if I had to. As Latinas, we have to.&quot;.

=== Writing process ===
Cisneros&#x27; writing is often influenced by her personal experiences and by observations of many of the people in her community. She once confided to other writers, at a conference in Santa Fe, that she writes down &quot;snippets of dialogue or monologue—records of conversations she hears, wherever she goes.&quot; These snippets are then mixed and matched, to create her stories. Names for her characters often come from the San Antonio phone book; &quot;she leafs through the listings for a last name, then repeats the process, for a first name.&quot; By mixing and matching, she is assured that she is not appropriating anyone&#x27;s real name or real story, but at the same time, her versions of characters and stories are believable.

Cisneros once found herself so immersed in the characters of her book &quot;Woman Hollering Creek&quot; that they began to infiltrate her subconscious mind. Once, while she was writing the story &quot;Eyes of Zapata,&quot; she awoke &quot;in the middle of the night, convinced, for the moment, that she was Ines, the young bride of the Mexican revolutionary. Her dream conversation with Zapata then became those characters&#x27; dialogue in her story.&quot;

Her biculturalism and bilingualism are also very important aspects of her writing. Cisneros was quoted by Robin Ganz as saying that she is grateful to have &quot;twice as many words to pick from ... two ways of looking at the world,&quot; and Ganz referred to her &quot;wide range of experience&quot; as a &quot;double-edged sword.&quot; Cisneros&#x27;s ability to speak two languages and to write about her two cultures gives her a unique position from where she is able to tell not just her story, but also, the stories of those around her.

=== Community legacy ===
Cisneros has been instrumental in building a strong community in San Antonio among other artists and writers through her work with the Macondo Foundation and the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation. The Macondo Foundation, which is named after the town in Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s book &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, &quot;works with dedicated and compassionate writers who view their work and talents as part of a larger task of community-building and non-violent social change.&quot; Officially incorporated in 2006, the foundation began in 1998 as a small workshop that took place in Cisneros&#x27;s kitchen. The Macondo Writers Workshop, which has since become an annual event, brings together writers &quot;working on geographic, cultural, economic, social and spiritual borders&quot; and has grown from 15 participants to over 120 participants in the first 9 years. Currently working out of Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, the Macondo Foundation makes awards such as the Gloria E. Anzaldúa Milagro Award honoring the memory of Anzaldúa, a fellow Chicana writer who died in 2004, by providing Chicano writers with support when they are in need of some time to heal their &quot;body, heart or spirit&quot; and the Elvira Cordero Cisneros Award which was created in memory of Sandra Cisneros&#x27;s mother. Macondo offers services to member writers such as health insurance and the opportunity to participate in the Casa Azul Residency Program. The Residency Program provides writers with a furnished room and office in the Casa Azul, a blue house across the street from where Cisneros lives in San Antonio, which is also the headquarters of the Macondo Foundation. In creating this program, Cisneros &quot;imagined the Casa as a space where Macondistas could retreat from the distractions of everyday life and have a room of his/her own for the process of emotional, intellectual and spiritual introspection.&quot;

Cisneros founded the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation in 1999. Named in memory of her father, the foundation &quot;has awarded over $75,500 to writers born in Texas, writing about Texas, or living in Texas since 2007&quot;. Its intention is to honor Cisneros&#x27;s father&#x27;s memory by showcasing writers who are as proud of their craft as Alfredo was of his craft as an upholsterer.

Cisneros co-founded with Bryce Milligan the Annual Texas Small Bookfair, the forerunner to the Inter-American Bookfair.

=== Chicano literary movement ===
Literary critic Claudia Sadowski-Smith has called Cisneros &quot;perhaps the most famous Chicana writer&quot;, and Cisneros has been acknowledged as a pioneer in her literary field as the first female Mexican-American writer to have her work published by a mainstream publisher. In 1989, &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot;, which was originally published by the small Hispanic publishing company Arte Público Press, was reissued in a second edition by Vintage Press; and in 1991, &quot;Woman Hollering Creek&quot; was published by Random House. As Ganz observes, previously, only male Chicano authors had successfully made the crossover from smaller publishers. That Cisneros had garnered enough attention to be taken on by Vintage Press said a lot about the possibility for Chicano literature to become more widely recognized. Cisneros spoke of her success and what it meant for Chicana literature, in an interview on National Public Radio on 19 September 1991:

As a pioneer Chicana author, Cisneros filled a void, by bringing to the fore a genre that had previously been at the margins of mainstream literature. With her first novel, &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot;, she moved away from the poetic style that was common in Chicana literature, at the time, and she began to define a &quot;distinctive Chicana literary space,” challenging familiar literary forms and addressing subjects such as gender inequality and the marginalization of cultural minorities. According to literary critic Alvina E Quintana, &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot; is a book that has reached beyond the Chicano and Latino literary communities and is, now, read by people of all ethnicities. Quintana states that Cisneros&#x27;s writing is accessible for both Anglo- and Mexican-Americans, alike, since it is free from anger or accusation, presenting the issues (such as Chicana identity and gender inequalities) in an approachable way. Cisneros&#x27;s writing has been influential in shaping both Chicana and feminist literature. Quintana sees her fiction as a form of social commentary, contributing to a literary tradition that resembles the work of contemporary cultural anthropologists, in its attempt to authentically represent the cultural experience of a group of people, and acknowledges Cisneros&#x27;s contribution to Chicana feminist aesthetics, by bringing women to the center as empowered protagonists, in much of her work.

== Writing style ==

=== Bilingualism ===
Cisneros often incorporates Spanish into her English writing, using Spanish where she feels that it better conveys the meaning or improves the rhythm of the passage. However, where possible, she constructs sentences so non-Spanish speakers can infer the meaning of Spanish words from their context. In &quot;Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories&quot; Cisneros writes: &quot;La Gritona. Such a funny name for such a lovely &quot;arroyo&quot;. But that&#x27;s what they called the creek that ran behind the house.&quot; Even if the English-speaking reader does not initially know that &quot;arroyo&quot; means &quot;creek&quot;, Cisneros soon translates it in a way that does not interrupt the flow of the text. She enjoys manipulating the two languages, creating new expressions in English by literally translating Spanish phrases. In the same book, Cisneros writes: &quot;And at the next full moon, I gave light, Tía Chucha holding up our handsome, strong-lunged boy.&quot; Previous sentences inform the reader that a baby is being born, but only a Spanish speaker will notice that &quot;I gave light&quot; is a literal translation of the Spanish &quot;dí a luz&quot; which means &quot;I gave birth.&quot; Cisneros joins other Hispanic-American US writers such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Piri Thomas, Giannina Braschi, Gustavo Pérez Firmat, and Junot Díaz, who create playful linguistic hybrids of Spanish and English. Cisneros noted on this process: &quot;All of a sudden, something happens to the English, something really new is happening, a new spice is added to the English language.&quot; Spanish always has a role in Cisneros&#x27;s work, even when she writes in English. As she discovered, after writing &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot; primarily in English, &quot;the syntax, the sensibility, the diminutives, the way of looking at inanimate objects&quot; were all characteristic of Spanish. For Cisneros, Spanish brings to her work not only colorful expressions, but also a distinctive rhythm and attitude.

=== Narrative modes, diction, and apparent simplicity ===
Cisneros&#x27;s fiction comes in various forms—as novels, poems, and short stories—by which she challenges both social conventions, with her &quot;celebratory breaking of sexual taboos and trespassing across the restrictions that limit the lives and experiences of Chicanas&quot;, and literary ones, with her &quot;bold experimentation with literary voice and her development of a hybrid form that weaves poetry into prose&quot;. Published in 1991, &quot;Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories&quot; is a collection of twenty-two short stories that form a collage of narrative techniques, each serving to engage and affect the reader in a different way. Cisneros alternates between first person, third person, and stream-of-consciousness narrative modes, and ranges from brief impressionistic vignettes to longer event-driven stories, and from highly poetic language to brutally frank realist language. Some stories lack a narrator to mediate between the characters and the reader; they are instead composed of textual fragments or conversations &quot;overheard&quot; by the reader. For example, &quot;Little Miracles, Kept Promises&quot; is composed of fictional notes asking for the blessings of patron saints, and &quot;The Marlboro Man&quot; transcribes a gossiping telephone conversation between two female characters.

Works by Cisneros can appear simple at first reading, but this is deceptive. She invites the reader to move beyond the text by recognizing larger social processes within the microcosm of everyday life: the phone conversation in &quot;The Marlboro Man&quot; is not merely idle gossip, but a text that allows the reader to dig into the characters&#x27; psyches and analyze their cultural influences. Literary critics have noted how Cisneros tackles complex theoretical and social issues through the vehicle of apparently simple characters and situations. For example, Ramón Saldívar observes that &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot; &quot;represents from the simplicity of childhood vision the enormously complex process of the construction of the gendered subject&quot;. In the same vein, Felicia J. Cruz describes how each individual will interact differently with &quot;Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories&quot;, thus eliciting such varied reader responses as &quot;it is about growing up&quot;, to &quot;it&#x27;s about a Chicana&#x27;s growing up&quot;, to &quot;it is a critique of patriarchal structures and exclusionary practices&quot;. Cisneros&#x27;s writing is rich not only for its symbolism and imagery, deemed by critic Deborah L Madsen to be &quot;both technically and aesthetically accomplished&quot;, but also for its social commentary and power to &quot;evoke highly personal responses&quot;. this helped her achieve the way she taught.

== Literary themes ==

=== Place ===
When Cisneros describes the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, the theme of &quot;place&quot; often emerges. &quot;Place&quot; refers not only to her novels&#x27; geographic locations, but also to the positions her characters hold, within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo-dominated and male-dominated places, where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas, where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, or in the case of their own home, it can be an empowering place, where they can act autonomously and express themselves, creatively. In &quot;The House on Mango Street,&quot; the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: &quot;Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man&#x27;s house. Not a daddy&#x27;s. A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody to shake a stick at. Nobody&#x27;s garbage to pick up after.&quot; An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for &quot;a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem.&quot; She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and she witnesses other women in the same position. According to Saldívar, Cisneros communicates, through this character, that a woman needs her own place, in order to realize her full potential—a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead &quot;a site of poetic self-creation.&quot; One source of conflict and grief, for Cisneros&#x27;s Chicana characters, is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros&#x27;s work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s famous essay &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;, that &quot;a woman must have money and a room of her own, if she is to write fiction,&quot; or, put another way, &quot;economic security&quot; and personal liberty are necessary for &quot;artistic production.&quot;

Cisneros explores the issue of &quot;place&quot; in relation not only to gender but also to class. As Saldívar has noted, &quot;Aside from the personal requirement of a gendered woman&#x27;s space, Esperanza recognizes the collective requirements of the working poor and the homeless, as well.&quot; He refers to Esperanza&#x27;s determination not to forget her working-class roots, once she obtains her dream house, and to open her doors to those who are less fortunate. Esperanza says &quot;Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I&#x27;ll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because I know how it is to be without a house.&quot; According to Saldívar, this statement of Esperanza&#x27;s alludes to &quot;the necessity for a decent living space&quot; that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.

=== Construction of femininity and female sexuality ===
As Madsen has described, Cisneros&#x27;s &quot;effort to negotiate a cross-cultural identity is complicated by the need to challenge the deeply rooted patriarchal values of both Mexican and American cultures.&quot; The lives of all Cisneros&#x27;s female characters are affected by how femininity and female sexuality are defined within this patriarchal value system and they must struggle to rework these definitions. As Cisneros has said: &quot;There&#x27;s always this balancing act, we&#x27;ve got to define what we think is fine for ourselves instead of what our culture says.&quot;

Cisneros shows how Chicanas, like women of many other ethnicities, internalize these norms starting at a young age, through informal education by family members and popular culture. In &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot;, for example, a group of girl characters speculate about what function a woman&#x27;s hips have: &quot;They&#x27;re good for holding a baby when you&#x27;re cooking, Rachel says ... You need them to dance, says Lucy ... You gotta know how to walk with hips, practice you know.&quot; Traditional female roles, such as childrearing, cooking, and attracting male attention, are understood by Cisneros&#x27;s characters to be their biological destiny. However, when they reach adolescence and womanhood, they must reconcile their expectations about love and sex with their own experiences of disillusionment, confusion and anguish. Esperanza describes her &quot;sexual initiation&quot;—an assault by a group of Anglo-American boys while awaiting her friend Sally at the fairground. She feels stricken and powerless after this, but above all betrayed; not only by Sally, who was not there for her, but &quot;by all the women who ever failed to contradict the romantic mythology of love and sex&quot;. Cisneros illustrates how this romantic mythology, fueled by popular culture, is often at odds with reality in &quot;Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories&quot;, where multiple references to romantic telenovelas obsessively watched by the female characters are juxtaposed with the abuse and poverty they face in their own lives.

When Cisneros addresses the subject of female sexuality, she often portrays negative scenarios in which men exert control over women through control over their sexuality, and explores the gap she perceives between the real sexual experiences of women and their idealized representation in popular culture. However, Cisneros also describes female sexuality in extremely positive terms, especially in her poetry. This is true, for example, of her 1987 volume of poetry &quot;My Wicked, Wicked Ways&quot;. According to Madsen, Cisneros refers to herself as &quot;wicked&quot; for having &quot;reappropriated, taken control of, her own sexuality and the articulation of it – a power forbidden to women under patriarchy&quot;. Through these poems she aims to represent &quot;the reality of female sexuality&quot; so that women readers will recognize the &quot;divisive effects&quot; of the stereotypes that they are expected to conform to, and &quot;discover the potential for joy in their bodies that is denied them&quot;.

Cisneros breaks the boundary between what is a socially acceptable way for women to act and speak and what is not, using language and imagery that have a &quot;boisterous humor&quot; and &quot;extrovert energy&quot; and are even at times &quot;deliberately shocking&quot;. Not all readers appreciate this &quot;shocking&quot; quality of some of Cisneros&#x27;s work. Both female and male readers have criticized Cisneros for the ways she celebrates her sexuality, such as the suggestive photograph of herself on the &quot;My Wicked, Wicked Ways&quot; cover (3rd Woman Press, 1987). Cisneros says of this photo: &quot;The cover is of a woman appropriating her own sexuality. In some ways, that&#x27;s also why it&#x27;s wicked: the scene is trespassing that boundary by saying &#x27;I defy you. I&#x27;m going to tell my own story.&#x27;&quot; Some readers &quot;failed to perceive the transgressive meaning of the gesture&quot;, thinking that she was merely being lewd for shock value, and questioned her legitimacy as a feminist. Cisneros&#x27;s initial response to this was dismay, but then she reports thinking &quot;Wait a second, where&#x27;s your sense of humor? And why can&#x27;t a feminist be sexy?&quot;

=== Construction of Chicana identity ===
The challenges faced by Cisneros&#x27;s characters on account of their gender cannot be understood in isolation from their culture, for the norms that dictate how women and men ought to think and behave are culturally determined and thus distinct for different cultural groups. Through her works, Cisneros conveys the experiences of Chicanas confronting the &quot;deeply rooted patriarchal values&quot; of Mexican culture through interactions not only with Mexican fathers, but the broader community which exerts pressure upon them to conform to a narrow definition of womanhood and a subservient position to men.

A recurrent theme in Cisneros&#x27;s work is the triad of figures that writer and theorist Gloria Anzaldúa has referred to as &quot;Our Mothers&quot;: the Virgen de Guadalupe, La Malinche and La Llorona. These symbolic figures are of great importance to identity politics and popular culture in Mexico and the southwest United States, and have been used, argues theorist Norma Alarcón, as reference points &quot;for controlling, interpreting, or visualizing women&quot; in Mexican-American culture.

Many theorists, including Jacqueline Doyle, Jean Wyatt, Emma Perez and Cordelia Candelaria, have argued that the gender identity of Mexican and Chicana women is complexly constructed in reference to these three figures. La Virgen de Guadalupe, a Catholic icon of the manifestation of the Virgin Mary in the Americas, is revered in Mexico as a &quot;nurturing and inspiring mother and maiden&quot;. La Malinche, the indigenous mistress and intermediary of conquistador Hernán Cortés, has according to Wyatt &quot;become the representative of a female sexuality at once passive, &quot;rapeable,&quot; and always already guilty of betrayal&quot;. Cisneros describes the problematic dichotomy of the virgin and the whore presented by these two figures: &quot;We&#x27;re raised in a Mexican culture that has two role models: La Malinche and la Virgen de Guadalupe. And you know that&#x27;s a hard route to go, one or the other, there&#x27;s no in-betweens.&quot; Madsen has noted that these &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27; archetypes are further complicated by the perception, held by many Chicana feminists, that they would be guilty of betraying their people, like La Malinche, if they attempt to define their femininity in more &quot;Anglo&quot; terms. Through her work, Cisneros critiques the pressures Chicanas face to suppress their sexuality or channel it into socially acceptable forms so as to not be labeled &quot;Malinchista[s] ... corrupted by gringa influences which threaten to splinter [their] people&quot;.

The third figure, La Llorona, who derives from a centuries-old Mexican/Southwestern folktale, is &quot;a proud young girl [who] marries above her station and is so enraged when her husband takes a mistress of his own class that she drowns their children in the river&quot;. She dies grief-stricken by the edge of the river after she is unable to retrieve her children and it is claimed that she can be heard wailing for them in the sound of the wind and water. These entities, from the gentle and pure Virgen de Guadalupe, to the violated and treacherous la Malinche, to the eternally grieving la Llorona give rise to a &quot;fragmentary subjectivity&quot; often experienced by Chicanas, and their need to come to terms with them, renegotiate them on their own terms, or reject them altogether.

The three &quot;Mothers&quot; come out most clearly in &quot;Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories&quot;. In the stories &quot;Never Marry a Mexican&quot; and &quot;Woman Hollering Creek&quot;, the female protagonists grapple with these &quot;Mexican icons of sexuality and motherhood that, internalized, seem to impose on them a limited and even negative definition of their own identities as women&quot;. The protagonist in &quot;Never Marry a Mexican&quot; is haunted by the myth of la Malinche, who is considered a whore and a traitor, and defies la Malinche&#x27;s passive sexuality with her own aggressive one. In &quot;Woman Hollering Creek&quot; the protagonist reinvents the la Llorona myth when she decides to take charge of her own future, and that of her children, and discovers that the &quot;grito&quot; of the myth, which is the Spanish word for the sound made by la Llorona, can be interpreted as a &quot;joyous holler&quot; rather than a grieving wail. It is the borderland, that symbolic middle ground between two cultures, which &quot;offers a space where such a negotiation with fixed gender ideals is at least possible&quot;.

=== Borderlands ===
Even though Cisneros does not explicitly locate her stories and novels on the Mexico-U.S. border, Sadowski-Smith identifies the concept as perhaps Cisneros&#x27;s most salient theme due to the constant border crossings, both real and metaphorical, of characters in all of her works. &quot;The House on Mango Street&quot; takes place in Chicago where the narrator lives, and in Mexico City where she visits extended family. &quot;Caramelo&quot; primarily takes place in those settings as well, but part of the book details the narrator&#x27;s experiences as a teenager in San Antonio, TX. Various characters in &quot;Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories&quot; also make trips to Mexico to reunite with family members. However, to quote literary critics Jesús Benito and Ana María Manzanas, the &quot;image of the border has become fully meaningful not only when we consider it as a physical line but when we decenter it and liberate it from the notion of space to encompass notions of sex, class, gender, ethnicity, identity, and community.&quot; Cisneros frequently divorces the border from its strictly geographic meaning, using it metaphorically to explore how Chicana identity is an amalgamation of both Mexican and Anglo-American cultures. The border represents the everyday experiences of people who are neither fully from one place nor the other; at times the border is fluid and two cultures can coexist harmoniously within a single person, but at other times it is rigid and there is an acute tension between them. Literary critic Katherine Payant has analyzed the border metaphor in &quot;Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories&quot;, which manifests in references to the Chicana/o characters&#x27; Mexican roots and the (im)migration between the two countries, the recurrence of overlapping pre-Columbian, mestizo and Southwestern Chicano myths, and the portrayal of Chicanas/os as &quot;straddling two or three cultures.&quot; Payant makes use of Gloria Anzaldúa&#x27;s concept of living &quot;on the borderlands&quot; to describe the experience of Cisneros&#x27;s Chicana characters who, in addition to their struggle to overcome patriarchal constructs of their gender and sexual identity, must negotiate linguistic and cultural boundaries.

== Personal life ==

Cisneros practices Buddhism and is queer, the latter of which is a theme she alludes to in her work.

<text>Harold Hart Crane (July 21, 1899 – April 27, 1932) was an American poet. Inspired by the Romantics and his fellow Modernists, Crane wrote highly stylized poetry, often noted for its complexity. His collection &quot;White Buildings&quot; (1926), featuring &quot;Chaplinesque&quot;, &quot;At Melville&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, &quot;Repose of Rivers&quot; and &quot;Voyages&quot;, helped to cement his place in the avant-garde literary scene of the time. The long poem &quot;The Bridge&quot; (1930) is an epic inspired by the Brooklyn Bridge.

Crane was born in Garrettsville, Ohio to Clarence A. Crane and Grace Edna Hart. He dropped out of East High School in Cleveland during his junior year and left for New York City, promising his parents he would later attend Columbia University. Crane took various jobs, including in copywriting and advertising. Throughout the early 1920s, various small but well-respected literary magazines published some of Crane&#x27;s poems, gaining him among the avant-garde a respect that &quot;White Buildings&quot; ratified and strengthened. His ambition to synthesize America was expressed in &quot;The Bridge&quot;, intended to be an uplifting counter to T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922). Initial critical reaction to it was mixed, with many praising the scope but criticizing the quality of the poems. On April 27, 1932, Crane, in an inebriated state, jumped off the steamship USS &quot;Orizaba&quot; and into the Gulf of Mexico while the ship was en route to New York. He left no suicide note, but witnesses believed his intentions to be suicidal. Throughout his life, he had multiple homosexual relations, many of which were described by, or otherwise influenced, his poetry. He had one known female partner, Peggy Cowley, around a year before his death.

Contemporary opinion was mixed, with poets including Marianne Moore and Wallace Stevens criticizing his work and others, including William Carlos Williams and E. E. Cummings, praising it. William Rose Benét wrote that, with &quot;The Bridge&quot;, Crane &quot;failed in creating what might have been a truly great poem&quot; but that it &quot;reveals potencies in the author that may make his next work even more remarkable.&quot; His last work, &quot;The Broken Tower&quot; (1932), was unfinished and published posthumously. Crane has been praised by several playwrights, poets, and literary critics, including Robert Lowell, Derek Walcott, Tennessee Williams, and Harold Bloom; the latter called him &quot;a High Romantic in the era of High Modernism&quot;. Allen Tate called Crane &quot;one of those men whom every age seems to select as the spokesman of its spiritual life; they give the age away.&quot;

==Life==
===Early life===
Crane was born in Garrettsville, Ohio to Clarence A. Crane and Grace Edna Hart. His father was a successful Ohio restaurateur and businessman who invented the Life Savers candy and held the patent, but sold it for $2,900 before the brand became popular. He made other candy and accumulated a fortune from the business with chocolate bars. Clarence Crane&#x27;s sister, Alice Crane Williams, was a composer and literary editor.

In 1894, the family moved to Warren, Ohio where his father opened a maple syrup company, which he sold in 1908 to Corn Products Refining Company. In April 1911, his father opened a chocolate manufacturing and retailing company, the Crane Chocolate Company. The family moved to Cleveland in 1911, into a house at 1709 East 115th Street. In 1913, Clarence Crane&#x27;s parents purchased the residence opposite the Hart&#x27;s.

Hart Crane began attending East High School around 1913–1914.

===Career===

Crane&#x27;s first published work was the poem &quot;C33&quot;, which was published in the Greenwich journal &quot;Bruno&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in 1917 in a feature entitled &quot;Oscar Wilde: Poems in His Praise&quot;. The poem is named after Oscar Wilde&#x27;s cell in The Ballad of Reading Gaol and his name appeared misspelled in print as &quot;Harold H Crone&quot;. The style he would use in his later books is apparent in poems written at the time. Crane dropped out of East High School in Cleveland during his junior year in December 1916 and left for New York City, promising his parents he would later attend Columbia University. His parents, in the middle of their divorce proceedings, were upset. Crane took various copywriting jobs and moved between friends&#x27; apartments in Manhattan. Crane&#x27;s mother and father were constantly fighting, and they divorced on April 14, 1917. The same year, he attempted to enlist in the military, but was rejected due to being a minor.

He worked in a munitions plant until the end of World War I. Between 1917 and 1924, he moved back and forth between New York and Cleveland, working as an advertising copywriter and a worker in his father&#x27;s factory. In 1925, he briefly lived with Caroline Gordon and Allen Tate. The two had a dispute with Crane due to the mess his belongings made throughout the house. Additionally, Crane and Tate had a disagreement over the negative outlook of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s work. This prompted them to leave two letters under his door requesting that he move out, which he complied with. He wrote his mother and grandmother in the spring of 1924:

Just imagine looking out your window directly on the East River with nothing intervening between your view of the Statue of Liberty, way down the harbour, and the marvelous beauty of Brooklyn Bridge close above you on your right! All of the great new skyscrapers of lower Manhattan are marshaled directly across from you, and there is a constant stream of tugs, liners, sail boats, etc in procession before you on the river! It&#x27;s really a magnificent place to live. This section of Brooklyn is very old, but all the houses are in splendid condition and have not been invaded by foreigners...

Based on Crane&#x27;s letters, New York was where he felt most at home. Additionally, much of his poetry takes place there.

====&quot;White Buildings&quot; (1926)====

Throughout the early 1920s, many small but well-respected literary magazines published some of Crane&#x27;s poems, gaining him among the avant-garde respect which was later cemented by the 1926 publication of &quot;White Buildings&quot;. On May 1, 1926, he went to Isla de la Juventud to reside in his mother&#x27;s family residence there. He received a contract from Liveright Publishing to publish &quot;White Buildings&quot; in July. &quot;White Buildings&quot; contains many of Crane&#x27;s most well-received and popular poems, including &quot;For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen&quot;, and &quot;Voyages&quot;, a sequence of erotic poems. They were written while he was falling in love with Emil Opffer, a Danish merchant mariner, whom &quot;Voyages&quot; is generally considered to be about. &quot;Faustus and Helen&quot; was part of a larger artistic struggle to meet modernity with something more than despair. Crane identified T. S. Eliot with that kind of despair, and while he acknowledged the greatness of &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, he also said it was &quot;so damned dead&quot;, an impasse, and characterized by a refusal to see &quot;certain spiritual events and possibilities&quot;. Crane&#x27;s self-appointed work would be to bring those spiritual events and possibilities to poetic life, and so create &quot;a mystical synthesis of America&quot;. Edmund Wilson said Crane had &quot;a style that is strikingly original—almost something like a great style, if there could be such a thing as a great style which was ... not ... applied to any subject at all.&quot;

Crane returned to New York in 1928 following a hurricane which left the Cuban residence damaged, and began living with friends and taking temporary jobs as a copywriter, or living off unemployment and the charity of friends and his father. For a time he lived in Brooklyn at 77 Willow Street until his lover, Opffer, invited him to live in Opffer&#x27;s father&#x27;s home at 110 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn Heights. Crane was overjoyed at the views the location afforded him.

====&quot;The Bridge&quot; (1930)====

The first known mention of &quot;The Bridge&quot; was in a 1923 letter to Gorham Munson in which he wrote:

Crane moved to Paterson, New Jersey, in 1927. In 1928, he worked as a secretary for a stockbroker visiting California. Crane&#x27;s mother, following her second marriage breakup, was living in the Los Angeles area. He revealed his homosexuality to her, causing a confrontation and Crane sneaking out on May 15, 1928, never to see her again. He later found out about the death of his grandmother, Elizabeth Hart, but his mother refused to pay him the $5,000 inheritance until he returned to live with her. He managed to convince her to give him the money and left for Europe towards late November and intended to live in Majorca, but instead went first to London then to Paris. In Paris in February 1929, Harry Crosby, who with his wife Caresse Crosby owned the fine arts press Black Sun Press, offered Crane the use of their country retreat, Le Moulin du Soleil in Ermenonville. They hoped he could use the time to concentrate on completing &quot;The Bridge&quot;. Crane spent several weeks at their estate where he wrote a draft of the &quot;Cape Hatteras&quot; section, a key part of his panegyric poem. In late June that year, Crane returned from the south of France to Paris. Crosby noted in his journal, &quot;Hart C. back from Marseilles where he slept with his thirty sailors and he began again to drink Cutty Sark.&quot; 
Crane got drunk at the Cafe Select and fought with waiters over his tab. When the Paris police were called, he fought with them and was beaten. They arrested and jailed him, fining him 800 francs. After Hart had spent six days in prison at La Santé, Crosby paid Crane&#x27;s fine and advanced him money for the passage back to the United States, where he finished &quot;The Bridge&quot;. In January 1930, the work was published by Black Sun Press in Paris and subsequently by Boni &amp; Liveright in the United States in April. The work received poor reviews, and Crane struggled with a sense of failure.

His ambition to synthesize America was expressed in &quot;The Bridge&quot;, intended to be an uplifting counter to Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. The Brooklyn Bridge is both the poem&#x27;s central symbol and its poetic starting point. Crane found a place to start his synthesis in Brooklyn. Arts patron Otto H. Kahn gifted him $2,000 to begin work on the panegyric poem, though he requested a loan of $1,000. After parting with the Opffers, Crane left for Paris in early 1929, but continued to struggle with his mental health. His drinking became notably worse during the late 1920s, while he was finishing &quot;The Bridge&quot;.

====&quot;The Broken Tower&quot; (1932)====

He visited his father, who had started an inn in the vicinity of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, in 1931. Crane visited Mexico in 1931–32 on a Guggenheim Fellowship, and his drinking continued as he suffered from bouts of alternating depression and elation. When Peggy Cowley, wife of his friend Malcolm Cowley, agreed to a divorce, she joined Crane. The two began a romantic relationship on December 25, 1931. As far as is known, she was his only heterosexual partner. &quot;The Broken Tower&quot;, one of his last published poems, emerged from that affair. Crane still felt himself a failure, in part because he recommenced his homosexual activities despite his relationship with Cowley. He claimed he would commit suicide multiple times.

&quot;The Broken Tower&quot; is the last poem meant to be published by poet Hart Crane in 1932. He intended it to be &quot;an epic of the modern consciousness.&quot; In keeping with the varieties and difficulties of Crane criticism, the poem has been interpreted widely—as a death ode, life ode, process poem, visionary poem, and a poem on failed vision—but its biographical impetus out of Crane&#x27;s first heterosexual affair (with Peggy Cowley, estranged wife of Malcolm Cowley) is generally undisputed. Written early in the year and finished two months prior to his death, the poem was rejected by &quot;Poetry Magazine&quot;, and only appeared in print (in the June 1932 edition of &quot;The New Republic&quot;) after Crane&#x27;s death by water.

Crane and Peggy both decided to return to New York on the steamship &quot;Orizaba&quot;, in April 1932 because Crane&#x27;s stepmother had invited him back to settle the estate of his father, who had died the month prior. This was the same ship aboard which he had gone to Cuba in 1926. The Orizaba departed from Vera Cruz, Mexico on April 23 and stopped at Havana, Cuba on April 26. While aboard, Crane was assaulted after making sexual advances to a male crew member.

Just before noon on April 27, 1932, Crane jumped overboard into the Gulf of Mexico. 
Although he had been drinking heavily and left no suicide note, witnesses believed his intentions to be suicidal, as several reported that he exclaimed &quot;Goodbye, everybody!&quot; before jumping overboard. The ship was about from Cuba. An article the following day from the New York Times linked his death to his father&#x27;s. His body was never recovered. A marker on his father&#x27;s tombstone at Park Cemetery outside Garrettsville, Portage County, Ohio includes the inscription, &quot;Harold Hart Crane 1899–1932 lost at sea&quot;.

==Writing==
===Influences===
Crane was heavily influenced by T. S. Eliot, in particular &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. &quot;The Bridge&quot; was intended to be a more optimistic view of society than that of &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. He first read &quot;The Waste Land&quot; in the November 1922 edition of &quot;The Dial&quot;.

Walt Whitman, William Blake, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Emily Dickinson were also particularly influential to Crane. As a teenager, Crane also read Plato, Honoré de Balzac, and Percy Bysshe Shelley.

===Criticism===
Crane&#x27;s critical effort is mostly to be found in his letters: he corresponded regularly with Allen Tate, Yvor Winters, and Gorham Munson, and shared critical dialogues with Eugene O&#x27;Neill, William Carlos Williams, E. E. Cummings, Sherwood Anderson, Kenneth Burke, Waldo Frank, Harriet Monroe, Marianne Moore, and Gertrude Stein. He was also an acquaintance of H. P. Lovecraft, who would eventually voice concern over Crane&#x27;s premature aging due to alcohol abuse. Selections of Crane&#x27;s letters are available in many editions of his poetry. His two most famous stylistic defenses emerged from correspondences: his &quot;General Aims and Theories&quot; (1925) was written to urge Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s critical foreword to &quot;White Buildings&quot;, then passed around among friends, yet unpublished during Crane&#x27;s life; and the famous &quot;Letter to Harriet Monroe&quot; (1926) was part of an exchange for the publication of &quot;At Melville&#x27;s Tomb&quot; in &quot;Poetry&quot;.

====&quot;Logic of metaphor&quot;====
Crane&#x27;s most quoted criticism is in the circulated, if long and unpublished, &quot;General Aims and Theories&quot;: &quot;As to technical considerations: the motivation of the poem must be derived from the implicit emotional dynamics of the materials used, and the terms of expression employed are often selected less for their logical (literal) significance than for their associational meanings. Via this and their metaphorical inter-relationships, the entire construction of the poem is raised on the organic principle of a &#x27;logic of metaphor,&#x27; which antedates our so-called pure logic, and which is the genetic basis of all speech, hence consciousness and thought-extension.&quot;

There is also some mention of it, though it is not so much presented as a critical neologism, in his letter to Harriet Monroe: &quot;The logic of metaphor is so organically entrenched in pure sensibility that it can&#x27;t be thoroughly traced or explained outside of historical sciences, like philology and anthropology.&quot; L. S. Dembo&#x27;s influential study of &quot;The Bridge&quot;, &quot;Hart Crane&#x27;s Sanskrit Charge&quot; (1960), reads this &#x27;logic&#x27; well within the familiar rhetoric of the Romantics: &quot;The &quot;Logic of metaphor&quot; was simply the written form of the &#x27;bright logic&#x27; of the imagination, the crucial sign stated, the Word made words... As practiced, the logic of metaphor theory is reducible to a fairly simple linguistic principle: the symbolized meaning of an image takes precedence over its literal meaning; regardless of whether the vehicle of an image makes sense, the reader is expected to grasp its tenor.&quot;

===Style===
====Difficulty====
The publication of &quot;White Buildings&quot; was delayed by Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s struggle (and eventual failure) to articulate his appreciation in a foreword to it; and many critics since have used Crane&#x27;s difficulty as an excuse for a quick dismissal. O&#x27;Neill did, however, write a draft for such a foreword. The text said of Crane that &quot;the great difficulty which his poetry presents the reader, is naturally,
the style. The theme never appears in explicit statement&quot;. The publisher Harcourt rejected &quot;White Buildings&quot;, with Harrison Smith writing Crane is &quot;a genuine poet ... [but &quot;White Buildings&quot;] is really the most perplexing kind of poetry.&quot; A young Tennessee Williams, then falling in love with Crane&#x27;s poetry, could &quot;hardly understand a single line—of course the individual lines aren&#x27;t supposed to be intelligible. The message, if there actually is one, comes from the total effect.&quot; Crane was aware that his poetry was difficult. Some of his essays originated as encouraging epistles, explications and stylistic apologies to editors, updates to his patron, and both well-considered or impulsive letters to friends. It was only his exchange with Harriet Monroe at &quot;Poetry&quot;, when she initially refused to print &quot;At Melville&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, that urged Crane to describe his &quot;logic of metaphor&quot; in print: 
If the poet is to be held completely to the already evolved and exploited sequences of imagery and logic—what field of added consciousness and increased perceptions (the actual province of poetry, if not lullabies) can be expected when one has to relatively return to the alphabet every breath or two? In the minds of people who have sensitively read, seen, and experienced a great deal, isn&#x27;t there a terminology something like short-hand as compared to usual description and dialectics, which the artist ought to be right in trusting as a reasonable connective agent toward fresh concepts, more inclusive evaluations?

Monroe was not impressed, though she acknowledged that others were, and printed the exchange alongside the poem: You find me testing metaphors, and poetic concept in general, too much by logic, whereas I find you pushing logic to the limit in a painfully intellectual search for emotion, for poetic motive. Crane had a relatively well-developed rhetoric for the defense of his poems; here is an excerpt from &quot;General Aims and Theories&quot;: New conditions of life germinate new forms of spiritual articulation. ...the voice of the present, if it is to be known, must be caught at the risk of speaking in idioms and circumlocutions sometimes shocking to the scholar and historians of logic.

====&quot;Homosexual text&quot;====
As a child, he had a sexual relationship with a man.

Criticism since the late 20th century has suggested reading Crane&#x27;s poems—&quot;The Broken Tower&quot;, &quot;My Grandmother&#x27;s Love Letters&quot;, the &quot;Voyages&quot; series, and others—with an eye to homosexual meanings in the text. Queer theorist Tim Dean argues that the obscurity of Crane&#x27;s style owes partially to the necessities of being a semi-public homosexual—not quite closeted, but also, as legally and culturally necessary, not open: &quot;The intensity responsible for Crane&#x27;s particular form of difficulty involves not only linguistic considerations but also culturally subjective concerns. This intensity produces a kind of privacy that is comprehensible in terms of the cultural construction of homosexuality and its attendant institutions of privacy.&quot;

Thomas Yingling objects to the traditional, New Critical and Eliotic readings of Crane, arguing that the &quot;American myth criticism and formalist readings&quot; have &quot;depolarized and normalized our reading of American poetry, making any homosexual readings seem perverse.&quot; Even more than a personal or political problem, though, Yingling argues that such &quot;biases&quot; obscure much of what the poems make clear; he cites, for instance, the last lines of &quot;My Grandmother&#x27;s Love Letters&quot; from &quot;White Buildings&quot; as a haunting description of estrangement from the norms of (heterosexual) family life:

Brian Reed has contributed to a project of critical reintegration of queer criticism with other critical methods, suggesting that an overemphasis on the sexual biography of Crane&#x27;s poetry can skew a broader appreciation of his overall work. In one example of Reed&#x27;s approach, he published a close reading of Crane&#x27;s lyric poem, &quot;Voyages&quot;, (a love poem that Crane wrote for his lover Emil Opffer) on the Poetry Foundation website, analyzing the poem based strictly on the content of the text itself and not on outside political or cultural matters.

===Accusations of plagiarism===

In mid-December 1926, Crane visited William Murrell Fisher in Woodstock, a literary critic whom he first met via their mutual friend Gorham Munson. There, Fisher shared with Crane multiple manuscripts of poems by Samuel Greenberg,a little-known poet who had died in 1917. Writing to Gorham Munson on December 20, Crane wrote &quot;This poet, Grünberg, which Fisher nursed until he died of consumption at a Jewish Hospital in New York was a Rimbaud in embryo ... Fisher has shown me an amazing amount of material, some of which I am copying and will show you when I get back.&quot; 
Morris Greenberg, Samuel&#x27;s brother, had given five of Samuel&#x27;s notebooks to Fisher so that he could get them published. Crane copied forty-two poems from the notebooks, which he borrowed from Fisher for a period of less than a month. Many of Crane&#x27;s poems consisted of lines and phrases taken from Greenberg&#x27;s poems, always unattributed. Crane&#x27;s poem &quot;Emblems of Conduct&quot;, the third in &quot;White Buildings&quot;, consisted solely of rearranged lines from Greenberg&#x27;s poems.

The plagiarism went unnoticed for decades until Marc Simon published &quot;Samuel Greenberg, Hart Crane and the Lost Manuscripts&quot; in 1978, detailing how Crane copied from Greenberg. Scholarly interpretation over the intent and morality of Hart Crane&#x27;s actions varies. Writer and critic Samuel R. Delany argues Crane merely tried to draw attention to an unknown poet and wanted readers to experience for themselves the delight of realizing one of his influences without him telling them.

==Influence==
===Among contemporaries===
Crane was admired by artists including Eugene O&#x27;Neill, Kenneth Burke, Edmund Wilson, E. E. Cummings, Tennessee Williams and William Carlos Williams. Although Crane had his sharp critics, among them Marianne Moore and Ezra Pound, Moore did publish his work, as did T. S. Eliot, who, moving even further out of Pound&#x27;s sphere, may have borrowed some of Crane&#x27;s imagery for &quot;Four Quartets&quot;, in the beginning of &quot;East Coker&quot;, which is reminiscent of the final section of &quot;The River&quot;, from &quot;The Bridge&quot;.

Yvor Winters and Allen Tate both praised &quot;White Buildings&quot; but considered &quot;The Bridge&quot; to be a failure.

===Legacy===
Mid-century American poets, such as John Berryman and Robert Lowell, cited Crane as a significant influence. Both poets also wrote about Crane in their poetry. Berryman wrote him one of his famous elegies in &quot;The Dream Songs&quot;, and Lowell published his &quot;Words for Hart Crane&quot; in &quot;Life Studies&quot; (1959): &quot;Who asks for me, the Shelley of my age, / must lay his heart out for my bed and board.&quot; Lowell thought that Crane was the most important American poet of the generation to come of age in the 1920s, stating that &quot;[Crane] got out more than anybody else ... he somehow got New York City; he was at the center of things in the way that no other poet was.&quot; Lowell also described Crane as being &quot;less limited than any other poet of his generation.&quot;

Tennessee Williams said that he wanted to be &quot;given back to the sea&quot; at the &quot;point most nearly determined as the point at which Hart Crane gave himself back&quot;. One of Williams&#x27;s last plays, a &quot;ghost play&quot; titled &quot;Steps Must Be Gentle&quot;, explores Crane&#x27;s relationship with his mother.

In a 1991 interview with Antonio Weiss of &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, the literary critic Harold Bloom talked about how Crane, along with William Blake, initially sparked his interest in literature at a very young age: I was preadolescent, ten or eleven years old. I still remember the extraordinary delight, the extraordinary force that Crane and Blake brought to me—in particular Blake&#x27;s rhetoric in the longer poems—though I had no notion what they were about. I picked up a copy of &quot;The Collected Poems of Hart Crane&quot; in the Bronx Library. I still remember when I lit upon the page with the extraordinary trope, &quot;O Thou steeled Cognizance whose leap commits / The agile precincts of the lark&#x27;s return.&quot; I was just swept away by it, by the Marlovian rhetoric. I still have the flavor of that book in me. Indeed it&#x27;s the first book I ever owned. I begged my oldest sister to give it to me, and I still have the old black and gold edition she gave me for my birthday back in 1942 . . . I suppose the only poet of the twentieth century that I could secretly set above Yeats and Stevens would be Hart Crane.
Bloom also authored the introduction to the centennial edition of the &quot;Complete Poems of Hart Crane&quot;.

Thomas Lux has stated, &quot;If the devil came to me and said &#x27;Tom, you can be dead and Hart can be alive,&#x27; I&#x27;d take the deal in a heartbeat if the devil promised, when arisen, Hart would have to go straight into A.A.&quot;

The literary critic Adam Kirsch has argued that &quot;[Crane has been] a special case in the canon of American modernism, his reputation never quite as secure as that of Eliot or Stevens.&quot;

In 2011, the American poet Gerald Stern wrote an essay on Crane in which he stated, &quot;Some, when they talk about Crane, emphasize his drinking, his chaotic life, his self-doubt, and the dangers of his sexual life, but he was able to manage these things, even though he died at 32, and create a poetry that was tender, attentive, wise, and radically original.&quot; At the conclusion of his essay, Stern writes, &quot;Crane is always with me, and whatever I wrote, short poem or long, strange or unstrange—his voice, his tone, his sense of form, his respect for life, his love of the word, his vision have affected me. But I don&#x27;t want, in any way, to exploit or appropriate this amazing poet whom I am, after all, so different from, he who may be, finally, the great poet, in English, of the twentieth century.&quot;

Beyond poetry, Crane&#x27;s suicide inspired several works of art by noted artist Jasper Johns, including &quot;Periscope&quot;, &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot;, and &quot;Diver&quot;, as well as &quot;A Symphony of Three Orchestras&quot; by Elliott Carter (inspired by &quot;The Bridge&quot;) and the painting &quot;Eight Bells&#x27; Folly, Memorial for Hart Crane&quot; by Marsden Hartley.

==Depictions==
Crane is the subject of &quot;The Broken Tower&quot;, a 2011 American student film by the actor James Franco who wrote, directed, and starred in the film which was the master&#x27;s thesis project for his MFA in filmmaking at New York University. He loosely based his script on Paul Mariani&#x27;s 1999 nonfiction book &quot;The Broken Tower: A Life of Hart Crane&quot;. Despite being a student film, &quot;The Broken Tower&quot; was shown at the Los Angeles Film Festival in 2011 and received DVD distribution in 2012 by Focus World Films.

Crane appears as a character in Samuel R. Delany&#x27;s story &quot;&quot;, and in &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.

<text>The flying buttress (arc-boutant, arch buttress) is a specific form of buttress composed of a ramping arch that extends from the upper portion of a wall to a pier of great mass, in order to convey to the ground the lateral forces that push a wall outwards, which are forces that arise from vaulted ceilings of stone and from wind-loading on roofs.

The namesake and defining feature of a flying buttress is that it is not in contact with the wall at ground level, unlike a traditional buttress, and transmits the lateral forces across the span of intervening space between the wall and the pier. To provide lateral support, flying-buttress systems are composed of two parts: (i) a massive pier, a vertical block of masonry situated away from the building wall, and (ii) an arch that bridges the span between the pier and the wall – either a segmental arch or a quadrant arch – the &quot;flyer&quot; of the flying buttress.

== History ==

As a lateral-support system, the flying buttress was developed during late antiquity and later flourished during the Gothic period (12th–16th c.) of architecture. Ancient examples of the flying buttress can be found on the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna and on the Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki. The architectural-element precursors of the medieval flying buttress derive from Byzantine architecture and Romanesque architecture, in the design of churches, such as Durham Cathedral, where arches transmit the lateral thrust of the stone vault over the aisles; the arches were hidden under the gallery roof, and transmitted the lateral forces to the massive, outer walls. By the decade of 1160, architects in the Île-de-France region employed similar lateral-support systems that featured longer arches of finer design, which run from the outer surface of the clerestory wall, over the roof of the side aisles (hence the visibility from the outside) to meet a heavy, vertical buttress rising above the top of the outer wall.

The flying buttresses of Notre Dame de Paris, constructed in 1180, were among the earliest to be used in a Gothic cathedral. Flying buttresses were also used at about the same time to support the upper walls of the apse at the Church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, completed in 1163.
The advantage of such lateral-support systems is that the outer walls do not have to be massive and heavy in order to resist the lateral-force thrusts of the vault. Instead, the wall surface could be reduced (allowing for larger windows, often glazed with stained glass) because the vertical mass is concentrated onto external buttresses. The design of early flying buttresses tended to be heavier than required for the static loads to be borne, e.g. at Chartres Cathedral (ca. 1210), and around the apse of the Saint Remi Basilica, which is an extant, early example in its original form (ca. 1170). Later architects progressively refined the design of the flying buttress, and narrowed the flyers, some of which were constructed with one thickness of voussoir (wedge brick) with a capping stone atop, e.g. at Amiens Cathedral, Le Mans Cathedral, and Beauvais Cathedral.

The architectural design of Late Gothic buildings featured flying buttresses, some of which included flyers decorated with crockets (hooked decorations) and sculpted figures set in aedicules (niches) recessed into the buttresses.

The architecture of the Renaissance eschewed the lateral support of the flying buttress in favour of thick-wall construction. Despite its disuse for function and style in construction and architecture, in the early 20th century, the flying-buttress design was revived by Canadian engineer William P. Anderson to build lighthouses.

== Construction ==

Given that most of the weight-load is transmitted from the ceiling through the upper part of the walls, the flying buttress is a two-part composite support that features a semi-arch that extends to a massive pier far from the wall, and provides most of the load-bearing capacity of a traditional buttress, which is engaged with the wall from top to bottom; thus, the flying buttress is a lighter and more cost-effective architectural structure.

By relieving the load-bearing walls of excess weight and thickness, in the way of a smaller area of contact, using flying buttresses enables installing windows in a greater wall surface area. This feature and a desire to let in more light, led to flying buttresses becoming one of the defining factors of medieval Gothic architecture and a feature used extensively in the design of churches from then and onwards. In the design of Gothic churches, two arched flyers were applied, one above the other, in which the lower flyer (positioned below the springing point of the vault) resists the lateral-thrust forces of the vault, whilst the upper flyer resists the forces of wind-loading on the roof. The vertical buttresses (piers) at the outer end of the flyers usually were capped with a pinnacle (either a cone or a pyramid) usually ornamented with crockets, to provide additional vertical-load support with which to resist the lateral thrust conveyed by the flyer.

;Remedial support application
Another application of the flying-buttress support system is the reinforcement of a leaning wall in danger of collapsing, especially a load-bearing wall; for example, at the village of Chaddesley Corbett in Worcestershire, England, the practical application of a flying buttress to a buckled wall was more practical than dismantling and rebuilding the wall.
== Aesthetic style of the Gothic period ==

The need to build large cathedrals that could house many people along multiple aisles provided the stimulus for the Gothic style to be developed. The flying buttress was the solution to these massive stone buildings that needed additional support. Although the flying buttress originally served a structural purpose, they are now a staple in the aesthetic style of the Gothic period. The flying buttress originally helped bring the idea of open space and light to the cathedrals through stability and structure, by supporting the clerestory and the weight of the high roofs. The height of the cathedrals and amply sized windows among the clerestory creates an open space giving the illusion of no clear boundaries.

It also makes the space more dynamic and less static separating the Gothic style from the flatter, more two dimensional, Romanesque style. After the introduction of the flying buttress this same concept could be seen on the exterior of the cathedrals as well. Open space below the arches of the flying buttress has the same effect as the clerestory within the church allowing the viewer to see through the arches. The buttresses also reach into the sky similar to the pillars within the church which creates more upward space, making the exterior space equally as dynamic as the interior space and creating a sense of coherence and continuity.

== In fiction ==
The architecture and construction of a medieval cathedral with flying buttresses figures prominently into the plot of the historical novel &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; by Ken Follett (1989).

<text>Orthopedic surgery or orthopedics (alternative spelling orthopaedics) is the branch of surgery concerned with conditions involving the musculoskeletal system. Orthopedic surgeons use both surgical and nonsurgical means to treat musculoskeletal trauma, spine diseases, sports injuries, degenerative diseases, infections, tumors, and congenital disorders.
== Etymology ==
Nicholas Andry coined the word in French as &quot;&quot;, derived from the Ancient Greek words (&quot;correct&quot;, &quot;straight&quot;) and (&quot;child&quot;), and published &quot;Orthopedie&quot; (translated as &quot;Orthopædia: Or the Art of Correcting and Preventing Deformities in Children&quot;) in 1741. The word was assimilated into English as &quot;orthopædics&quot;; the ligature &quot;æ&quot; was common in that era for &quot;ae&quot; in Greek- and Latin-based words. As the name implies, the discipline was initially developed with attention to children, but the correction of spinal and bone deformities in all stages of life eventually became the cornerstone of orthopedic practice.

=== Differences in spelling ===
As with many words derived with the &quot;æ&quot; ligature, simplification to either &quot;ae&quot; or just &quot;e&quot; is common, especially in North America. In the US, the majority of college, university, and residency programmes, and even the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, still use the spelling with the digraph ae, though hospitals usually use the shortened form. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are acceptable; &quot;orthopaedics&quot; is the normal spelling in the UK in line with other fields which retain &quot;ae&quot;.

== History ==
=== Early orthopedics ===
Many developments in orthopedic surgery have resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the Middle Ages, the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses&#x27; blood, which dried to form a stiff, if unsanitary, splint.

Originally, the term orthopedics meant the correcting of musculoskeletal deformities in children. Nicolas Andry, a professor of medicine at the University of Paris, coined the term in the first textbook written on the subject in 1741. He advocated the use of exercise, manipulation, and splinting to treat deformities in children. His book was directed towards parents, and while some topics would be familiar to orthopedists today, it also included &#x27;excessive sweating of the palms&#x27; and freckles.

Jean-André Venel established the first orthopedic institute in 1780, which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children&#x27;s skeletal deformities. He developed the club-foot shoe for children born with foot deformities and various methods to treat curvature of the spine.

Advances made in surgical technique during the 18th century, such as John Hunter&#x27;s research on tendon healing and Percival Pott&#x27;s work on spinal deformity steadily increased the range of new methods available for effective treatment. Robert Chessher, a pioneering British orthopedist, invented the double-inclined plane, used to treat lower-body bone fractures, in 1790. Antonius Mathijsen, a Dutch military surgeon, invented the plaster of Paris cast in 1851. Until the 1890s, though, orthopedics was still a study limited to the correction of deformity in children. One of the first surgical procedures developed was percutaneous tenotomy. This involved cutting a tendon, originally the Achilles tendon, to help treat deformities alongside bracing and exercises. In the late 1800s and first decades of the 1900s, significant controversy arose about whether orthopedics should include surgical procedures at all.

=== Modern orthopedics ===
Examples of people who aided the development of modern orthopedic surgery were Hugh Owen Thomas, a surgeon from Wales, and his nephew, Robert Jones. Thomas became interested in orthopedics and bone-setting at a young age, and after establishing his own practice, went on to expand the field into the general treatment of fracture and other musculoskeletal problems. He advocated enforced rest as the best remedy for fractures and tuberculosis, and created the so-called &quot;Thomas splint&quot; to stabilize a fractured femur and prevent infection. He is also responsible for numerous other medical innovations that all carry his name: Thomas&#x27;s collar to treat tuberculosis of the cervical spine, Thomas&#x27;s maneuvere, an orthopedic investigation for fracture of the hip joint, the Thomas test, a method of detecting hip deformity by having the patient lying flat in bed, and Thomas&#x27;s wrench for reducing fractures, as well as a so-called &quot;osteoclast&quot; implement to break and reset bones.

Thomas&#x27;s work was not fully appreciated in his own lifetime. Only during the First World War did his techniques come to be used for injured soldiers on the battlefield. His nephew, Sir Robert Jones, had already made great advances in orthopedics in his position as surgeon-superintendent for the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1888. He was responsible for the injured among the 20,000 workers, and he organized the first comprehensive accident service in the world, dividing the 36-mile site into three sections, and establishing a hospital and a string of first-aid posts in each section. He had the medical personnel trained in fracture management. He personally managed 3,000 cases and performed 300 operations in his own hospital. This position enabled him to learn new techniques and improve the standard of fracture management. Physicians from around the world came to Jones&#x27; clinic to learn his techniques. Along with Alfred Tubby, Jones founded the British Orthopedic Society in 1894.
During the First World War, Jones served as a Territorial Army surgeon. He observed that treatment of fractures both, at the front and in hospitals at home, was inadequate, and his efforts led to the introduction of military orthopedic hospitals. He was appointed Inspector of Military Orthopedics, with responsibility for 30,000 beds. The hospital in Ducane Road, Hammersmith, became the model for both British and American military orthopedic hospitals. His advocacy of the use of Thomas splint for the initial treatment of femoral fractures reduced mortality of open fractures of the femur from 87% to less than 8% in the period from 1916 to 1918.

The use of intramedullary rods to treat fractures of the femur and tibia was pioneered by Gerhard Küntscher of Germany. This made a noticeable difference to the speed of recovery of injured German soldiers during World War II and led to more widespread adoption of intramedullary fixation of fractures in the rest of the world. Traction was the standard method of treating thigh bone fractures until the late 1970s, though, when the Harborview Medical Center group in Seattle popularized intramedullary fixation without opening up the fracture.
The modern total hip replacement was pioneered by Sir John Charnley, expert in tribology at Wrightington Hospital, in England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could be replaced by implants cemented to the bone. His design consisted of a stainless steel, one-piece femoral stem and head, and a polyethylene acetabular component, both of which were fixed to the bone using PMMA (acrylic) bone cement. For over two decades, the Charnley low-friction arthroplasty and its derivative designs were the most-used systems in the world. This formed the basis for all modern hip implants.

The Exeter hip replacement system (with a slightly different stem geometry) was developed at the same time. Since Charnley, improvements have been continuous in the design and technique of joint replacement (arthroplasty) with many contributors, including W. H. Harris, the son of R. I. Harris, whose team at Harvard pioneered uncemented arthroplasty techniques with the bone bonding directly to the implant.

Knee replacements, using similar technology, were started by McIntosh in rheumatoid arthritis patients and later by Gunston and Marmor for osteoarthritis in the 1970s, developed by John Insall in New York using a fixed bearing system, and by Frederick Buechel and Michael Pappas using a mobile bearing system.

External fixation of fractures was refined by American surgeons during the Vietnam War, but a major contribution was made by Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov in the USSR. He was sent, without much orthopedic training, to look after injured Russian soldiers in Siberia in the 1950s. With no equipment, he was confronted with crippling conditions of unhealed, infected, and misaligned fractures. With the help of the local bicycle shop, he devised ring external fixators tensioned like the spokes of a bicycle. With this equipment, he achieved healing, realignment, and lengthening to a degree unheard of elsewhere. His Ilizarov apparatus is still used today as one of the distraction osteogenesis methods.

Modern orthopedic surgery and musculoskeletal research have sought to make surgery less invasive and to make implanted components better and more durable. On the other hand, since the emergence of the opioid epidemic, orthopedic surgeons have been identified as one of the highest prescribers of opioid medications. Decreasing prescription of opioids while still providing adequate pain control is a development in orthopedic surgery.

== Training ==
In the United States, orthopedic surgeons have typically completed four years of undergraduate education and four years of medical school and earned either a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree. Subsequently, these medical school graduates undergo residency training in orthopedic surgery. The five-year residency is a categorical orthopedic surgery training.

Selection for residency training in orthopedic surgery is very competitive. Roughly 700 physicians complete orthopedic residency training per year in the United States. About 10% of current orthopedic surgery residents are women; about 20% are members of minority groups. Around 20,400 actively practicing orthopedic surgeons and residents are in the United States. According to the latest Occupational Outlook Handbook (2011–2012) published by the United States Department of Labor, 3–4% of all practicing physicians are orthopedic surgeons.

Many orthopedic surgeons elect to do further training, or fellowships, after completing their residency training. Fellowship training in an orthopedic sub-specialty is typically one year in duration (sometimes two) and sometimes has a research component involved with the clinical and operative training. Examples of orthopedic subspecialty training in the United States are:
* Foot and ankle surgery
* Hand and upper extremities
* Hip and knee surgery
* Orthopedic oncologist
* Orthopedic trauma
* Osseointegration
* Pediatric orthopedics
* Shoulder and elbow
* Spine surgery
* Surgical sports medicine
* Total joint reconstruction (arthroplasty)

These specialized areas of medicine are not exclusive to orthopedic surgery. For example, hand surgery is practiced by some plastic surgeons, and spine surgery is practiced by most neurosurgeons. Additionally, foot and ankle surgery is also practiced by doctors of podiatric medicine (DPM) in the United States. Some family practice physicians practice sports medicine, but their scope of practice is nonoperative.

After completion of specialty residency or registrar training, an orthopedic surgeon is then eligible for board certification by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists. Certification by the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery or the American Osteopathic Board of Orthopedic Surgery means that the orthopedic surgeon has met the specified educational, evaluation, and examination requirements of the board. The process requires successful completion of a standardized written examination followed by an oral examination focused on the surgeon&#x27;s clinical and surgical performance over a 6-month period. In Canada, the certifying organization is the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada; in Australia and New Zealand, it is the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.

In the United States, specialists in hand surgery and orthopedic sports medicine may obtain a certificate of added qualifications in addition to their board primary certification by successfully completing a separate standardized examination. No additional certification process exists for the other subspecialties.

== Practice ==

According to applications for board certification from 1999 to 2003, the top 25 most common procedures (in order) performed by orthopedic surgeons are:
# Knee arthroscopy and 
# Shoulder arthroscopy and decompression
# Carpal tunnel release
# Knee arthroscopy and chondroplasty
# Removal of support implant
# Knee arthroscopy and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
# Knee replacement
# Repair of femoral neck fracture
# Repair of trochanteric fracture
# Debridement of skin/muscle/bone/ fracture
# Knee arthroscopy repair of both menisci
# Hip replacement
# Shoulder arthroscopy/distal clavicle excision
# Repair of rotator cuff tendon
# Repair fracture of radius/ulna
# Laminectomy
# Repair of ankle fracture (bimalleolar type)
# Shoulder arthroscopy and debridement
# Lumbar spinal fusion
# Repair fracture of the distal part of radius
# Low back intervertebral disc surgery
# Incise finger tendon sheath
# Repair of ankle fracture (fibula)
# Repair of femoral shaft fracture
# Repair of trochanteric fracture

A typical schedule for a practicing orthopedic surgeon involves 50–55 hours of work per week divided among clinic, surgery, various administrative duties, and possibly teaching and/or research if in an academic setting. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges in 2021, the average work week of an orthopedic surgeon was 57 hours. This is a very low estimation however, as research derived from a 2013 survey of orthopedic surgeons who self identified as &quot;highly successful&quot; due to their prominent positions in the field indicated average work weeks of 70 hours or more.

== Arthroscopy ==

The use of arthroscopic techniques has been particularly important for injured patients. Arthroscopy was pioneered in the early 1950s by Masaki Watanabe of Japan to perform minimally invasive cartilage surgery and reconstructions of torn ligaments. Arthroscopy allows patients to recover from the surgery in a matter of days, rather than the weeks to months required by conventional, &quot;open&quot; surgery; it is a very popular technique. Knee arthroscopy is one of the most common operations performed by orthopedic surgeons today, and is often combined with meniscectomy or chondroplasty. The majority of upper-extremity outpatient orthopedic procedures are now performed arthroscopically.

== Arthroplasty ==

Arthroplasty is an orthopedic surgery where the articular surface of a musculoskeletal joint is replaced, remodeled, or realigned by osteotomy or some other procedure. It is an elective procedure that is done to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis (rheumasurgery) or some other type of trauma. As well as the standard total knee replacement surgery, the unicompartmental knee replacement, in which only one weight-bearing surface of an arthritic knee is replaced, may be performed, but it bears a significant risk of revision surgery. Joint replacements are used for other joints, most commonly the hip or shoulder.

A post-surgical concern with joint replacements is wear of the bearing surfaces of components. This can lead to damage to the surrounding bone and contribute to eventual failure of the implant. The plastic chosen is usually ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, which can also be altered in ways that may improve wear characteristics. The risk of revision surgery has also been shown to be associated with surgeon volume.

== Epidemiology ==
Between 2001 and 2016, the prevalence of musculoskeletal procedures drastically increased in the U.S., from 17.9% to 24.2% of all operating-room (OR) procedures performed during hospital stays.

In a study of hospitalizations in the United States in 2012, spine and joint procedures were common among all age groups except infants. Spinal fusion was one of the five most common OR procedures performed in every age group except infants younger than 1 year and adults 85 years and older. Laminectomy was common among adults aged 18–84 years. Knee arthroplasty and hip replacement were in the top five OR procedures for adults aged 45 years and older.

<text>USS &quot;Trout&quot; (SS-202) was the fifth &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarine commissioned in the United States Navy, serving in the Pacific from 1941 to 1944. She received 11 battle stars for World War II service and Presidential Unit Citation for her second, third, and fifth war patrols. &quot;Trout&quot; also delivered ammunition to the besieged American forces on Corregidor and brought out 20 tons of gold bars and silver pesos from the Philippine currency reserve to Pearl Harbor. During 1941, she was used as a target by a series of tests determining the vulnerability of submarines to depth charge attacks.

&quot;Trout&quot; is credited with sinking 12 enemy ships for 37,144 tons according to JANAC records. During her first ten war patrols she made 32 torpedo attacks, firing 85 torpedoes, including 34 hits, 5 confirmed premature detonations, 5 confirmed duds, and 25 suspected duds. She was also involved in six battle surface actions and was attacked with depth charges eight times.

She was reported overdue on 17 April 1944 and presumed lost with all hands on her eleventh war patrol. Of the twelve &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarines, only five survived the war.

==Origins==
&quot;Trout&quot; was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the trout, any of certain small, fresh-water fishes, highly esteemed by anglers for their gameness, their rich and finely flavored flesh and their handsome (usually mottled or speckled) coloration. Her keel was laid down on 28 August 1939 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 21 May 1940 sponsored by Mrs. Walter B. Woodson, and commissioned on 15 November 1940 with Lieutenant Commander Frank Wesley &quot;Mike&quot; Fenno, Jr., as captain.

==Initial operations==
On 2 July 1941, following &quot;shakedown&quot; operations along the east coast, &quot;Trout&quot; and sister ship departed New York City, bound for the Pacific. After transiting the Panama Canal and stopping at San Diego, California, the submarines arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 August 1941, where she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 6 with others of her class.

&quot;Trout&quot; conducted training operations with Submarine Division 62 until 29 November when she departed Pearl Harbor to conduct a simulated war patrol off Midway Island.

==Wartime operations==

===1st patrol — America enters the war ===
On her defensive station, &quot;Trout&quot; patrolled submerged during daylight to avoid detection by ships or aircraft. On the morning of 7 December, she received word of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. That night, the surfaced submarine observed two destroyers shell Midway Island. She was about ten miles distant and proceeded toward the enemy ships at full speed, but they retired before she arrived. Frustrated in being unable to fire a shot, she continued her now-unrestricted war patrol until 20 December 1941 when Fenno returned the ship to Pearl Harbor.

===2nd patrol — to the Philippines===
On 12 January 1942, &quot;Trout&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor with 3500 rounds of 3&quot; AAA ammunition to be delivered to the besieged American forces on Corregidor. She topped off with fuel at Midway on 16 January and continued westward. On 27 January, near the Bonin Islands, she sighted a light off her port bow, closed to of the vessel, and fired a stern torpedo which missed. She closed to , discovered that her target was a submarine chaser, and, as she had been warned to avoid small ships, resumed her course for the Philippines. On 3 February, &quot;Trout&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;PT-34&quot; off Corregidor and was escorted through its minefields to its South Dock.

&quot;Trout&quot; unloaded her ammunition cargo, refueled, loaded two torpedoes, and requested additional ballast. Since neither sandbags nor sacks of concrete were available, she was given 20 tons of gold bars and silver pesos to be evacuated from the Philippines. The specie came from twelve Philippine banks emptied of their assets, absent the paper money, all of which had been burned to prevent it from falling into Japanese hands. She also loaded securities, mail, and United States Department of State dispatches before submerging shortly before daybreak to wait at the bottom in Manila Bay until the return of darkness. That evening, the submarine was loaded with more mail and securities before she was escorted to open water. &quot;Trout&quot; set a course for the East China Sea which she entered on 10 February.

That afternoon, &quot;Trout&quot; launched a torpedo at a freighter from a range of but missed. The submarine then closed the target before firing two more which both hit the freighter. Approximately 25 minutes later, her sonar heard four explosions that were the boilers of &quot;Chuwa Maru&quot; blowing up as she sank. That evening, &quot;Trout&quot; was returning through the Bonin Islands when she sighted a light. She changed course, closed the range to , and launched two torpedoes at the ship. Both missed. In the time that lapsed between firing the first and the second torpedo, an enemy torpedo passed down &quot;Trout&quot;’s port side. As the submarine went to , another torpedo passed overhead. &quot;Trout&quot; came up to periscope depth and fired a third torpedo at the target and blew it up. Sound picked up another ship running at full speed, but there was no opportunity to attack it. &quot;Trout&quot; was credited with sinking a small patrol ship of approximately 200 tons. When she reached Pearl Harbor on 3 March 1942, the submarine transferred her valuable ballast to the cruiser .

&quot;Trout&quot; received a Presidential Unit Citation for this patrol. Fenno received both the Navy Cross and Army Distinguished Service Cross, and all crew members were awarded the Army Silver Star by Hawaiian Department commanding general Delos C. Emmons in a shipboard ceremony on 18 March 1942.

===3rd patrol — into Japanese waters ===
The submarine&#x27;s third war patrol, conducted from 24 March to 17 May 1942 took her to Japanese home waters. On 9 April, &quot;Trout&quot; was patrolling between Ichie-Zaki and Shioni-Misaki when she sighted two small cargo ships. She launched two torpedoes at each target, but all missed. The next day, she launched one torpedo at a small steamer and missed again. On 11 April, she attacked a large freighter with two torpedoes. One hit the target but did not sink it. Between 16 April and 23 April &quot;Trout&quot; provided cover for the Doolittle Raid task force. Finally, on 24 April, the submarine hit a 10,000 ton tanker with two torpedoes off Cape Shiono, and it headed for the beach. A sweep of the periscope showed a cargo ship going to the aid of the tanker. &quot;Trout&quot; launched one torpedo and missed. She then closed to and fired another torpedo that hit with a tremendous explosion. When last seen, the cargo ship, too, was heading for shallow water. Four days later, the submarine attacked a 1,000 ton patrol vessel or minesweeper with a torpedo which sank it in two minutes. On 30 April, &quot;Trout&quot; attacked two ships off Shimo Misaki but missed both. On 2 May, the submarine sank the 5014 ton cargo ship &quot;Uzan Maru&quot;. Two days later, she fired a spread of two torpedoes at what was thought to be a freighter. The first torpedo missed, but the second hit forward of the bridge, sinking the converted gunboat &quot;Kongōsan Maru&quot;. The submarine was then subjected to a six-hour depth charge attack before she could clear the area.

For this patrol &quot;Trout&quot; received her second Presidential Unit Citation and Fenno his second award of the Navy Cross.

===4th patrol — Task Group 7.1 ===
&quot;Trout&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor on 21 May 1942, as a unit of Task Group 7.1, the Midway Island Patrol Group consisting of 12 submarines. Her station was south of the island as nine of the submarines were positioned fan-like to the west of Midway in preparation for the Japanese attack. At 08:12 on 4 June, &quot;Trout&quot; sighted a Japanese fighter plane preparing to attack from astern. She went deep and heard a series of light explosions. On 9 June, &quot;Trout&quot; passed through a large oil slick and some debris before rescuing two Japanese from a large wooden hatch cover. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 June without firing a torpedo and began a major refit that included installation of search radars and JP sonar in preparation for deployment to Australia. The &quot;Trout&quot; also carried two POWs (Chief Radioman Hatsuichi Yoshida and Fireman 3rd Class Kenichi Ishikawa) from the sunken Japanese cruiser &quot;Mikuma&quot;.

===5th patrol — the South Pacific ===
On 27 August,&quot;Trout&quot;, now under the command of Lt. Cdr. Lawson Paterson &quot;Red&quot; Ramage, proceeded to Australia via the Marshall and Caroline Islands. She began patrolling the southern approaches to Truk on 7 September and was detected by three patrol craft on 10 September, apparently triangulating her position using radar. Forced to go deep for one and a half hours, &quot;Trout&quot; was attacked by 45 depth charges. The next day, she sighted a large transport but escorts forced her to go deep and clear the area. On 21 September, the submarine fired three stern torpedoes at a naval auxiliary. The first torpedo broke the ship in half and the next two hit the aft section. The victim was subsequently identified as &quot;Koei Maru&quot;, a converted net tender of 900 tons. A week later, &quot;Trout&quot; picked up a carrier group consisting of an escort carrier, two cruisers, and two destroyers. The submarine closed to and fired a spread of five torpedoes. She heard two timed explosions and saw the carrier
slow, with smoke pouring out of her starboard side near the water line. &quot;Trout&quot; heard high-speed screws approaching and went to as a pattern of ten depth charges shook her severely.

On 3 October, with one week remaining in her patrol area, &quot;Trout&quot; approached to reconnoiter Otta Pass, the southern deepwater entrance to Truk Lagoon. Six miles west of South Islands, she came to periscope depth to obtain a navigational fix. Just as the periscope was lowered, there was a violent explosion close aboard that shook the ship violently. The entire crew was stunned by the shock. One man was thrown from his bunk, and another was knocked off his feet. &quot;Trout&quot; emergency dived to . As she passed on the way down, another bomb exploded without effect. Since both periscopes were out of commission, the submarine headed for Brisbane for emergency repairs and arrived at Capricorn Wharf, New Farm on 13 October 1942.

&quot;Trout&quot; received her third Presidential Unit Citation for this patrol.

===6th patrol — the Solomon Islands===
&quot;Trout&quot;″s sixth war patrol began on 26 October 1942 and took her to waters around the New Georgia Islands. On 13 November, she was patrolling north of Indispensable Strait when she was ordered to intercept the &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battleship en route to shell Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. On the morning of 14 November &quot;Trout&quot; located &quot;Kirishima&quot; and its escort force in the process of refueling but was unable to maneuver into an attack position. Stalking the force, &quot;Trout&quot; attacked when the Japanese came under air attack in the afternoon and fired a spread of five torpedoes with a depth setting of ; all missed or failed to detonate and she cleared the area. The patrol ended when the submarine returned to Brisbane ten days later.

After provisioning and off-loading her torpedoes, &quot;Trout&quot; departed Brisbane on 25 November for Fremantle, Western Australia, where her squadron was then based, arriving 2 December 1942.

===7th patrol — Borneo ===
On 29 December 1942, &quot;Trout&quot; stood out to sea to patrol the South China Sea off North Borneo. The submarine contacted a large tanker off Miri on 11 January 1943 and launched three torpedoes from a range of . The first two hit the target amidships but the third exploded prematurely. Four minutes later, there was a heavy explosion from the direction of the target. Since postwar examination of Japanese records shows no sinking, the damaged ship must have managed to limp back to port.

Ten days later off Indochina, &quot;Trout&quot; launched two torpedoes at a cargo ship from and watched as the unidentified ship sank immediately. On 29 January, the submarine launched three torpedoes at a destroyer believed to be the Thai &quot;Phra Ruang&quot; (the former R-class destroyer HMS &quot;Radiant&quot;) and watched each run true to the target. However, all proved to be duds. On 7 February, she sighted tanker &quot;Nisshin Maru No. 2&quot; moored off Lutong, Borneo. She made a submerged approach, launched two torpedoes at the target, heard one explosion, and observed smoke rise from the stern of the tanker. However, no sinking upon this occasion was confirmed. The &quot;Nisshin Maru No. 2&quot; was then towed and scrapped South of Ishigaki Island on 16 April 1943.

One week later &quot;Trout&quot; launched two torpedoes at what she thought to be a tanker as it emerged from a rain squall. The first torpedo blew off the target&#x27;s bow but the second was a dud. As the enemy ship was still steaming at eight knots, the submarine surfaced for battle with her deck guns. &quot;Trout&quot; opened fire, but soon seven of her men were wounded by enemy machine gun fire. She then swung around and fired a stern torpedo and watched &quot;Hirotama Maru&quot; turn her stern straight up with her screws still turning and slip under the waves. The patrol ended when the submarine returned to Fremantle on 25 February 1943.

===8th patrol — laying mines ===
&quot;Trout&quot; was next ordered to plant naval mines in Api Passage, off the northwest coast of Borneo. She got underway on 22 March 1943 and on 4 April, while en route from Balabac Strait to Miri, fired a spread of three torpedoes at a naval auxiliary. One hit the target amidships, raising a plume of water into the air, but the warhead did not explode. &quot;Trout&quot; fired a fourth torpedo but the ship saw its wake, turned, and dodged it. The next day, &quot;Trout&quot; launched three torpedoes at another ship with no results. She planted 23 naval mines in Api Passage on 7 and 8 April and then began patrolling the Singapore trade route. On 19 April, she launched four torpedoes at a freighter but scored no hits. Later in the day she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a tanker and missed. &quot;Trout&quot; sighted two trawlers on 23 April and battle surfaced. Her deck guns soon stopped the first ship dead in the water and set it on fire; they then turned the second one into a burning wreck. Since there was only one torpedo remaining, the submarine headed for Fremantle, where she arrived on 3 May 1943.

===9th patrol — special missions ===
The &quot;Trout&quot; was now under the command of her former executive officer, Lt. Cdr. Albert Hobbs Clark, a &quot;plank owner&quot; (member of original ship&#x27;s complement). From 27 May to 20 July 1943, &quot;Trout&quot; performed a special mission during an offensive war patrol to the southern Philippines. On 9 June, she missed a transport with three torpedoes. She then landed a five-man U.S. Army team at Labangan, Mindanao. On 15 July, the submarine fired a three-torpedo spread which destroyed the tanker &quot;Sanraku Maru&quot;. She contacted three small coastal steamers on 26 June and sank two of them with her deck guns. On 1 July, she sank &quot;Isuzu Maru&quot; with four torpedoes. Eight days later, &quot;Trout&quot; picked up a party of five American officers including Lt. Cdr. Charles &quot;Chick&quot; Parsons and AAF Lt. Col. William E. Dyess at Pagadian Bay on Mindanao and headed for Fremantle.

===10th patrol — sub to sub ===
&quot;Trout&quot; stood out to sea on 12 August to patrol the Surigao Strait and San Bernardino Strait en route back to Pearl Harbor. On 25 August, she battled a cargo-fisherman with her deck guns and then sent a boarding party on board the Japanese vessel. After they had returned to the submarine with the prize&#x27;s crew, papers, charts, and other material for study by intelligence officers, the submarine sank the vessel. Three of the five prisoners were later embarked in a dinghy off Tifore Island.

On 9 September, she fired three bow tubes at a &quot;Kaidai&quot;-class submarine off Surigao Strait. Thirty-five seconds later, there was a loud explosion which apparently stopped the target&#x27;s screws. &quot;Trout&quot;″s sound crew reported a torpedo approaching her port beam, and she went to . After she heard a second explosion, &quot;Trout&quot; came to periscope level, but found no sign of submarine which she had sunk. On 22 September, one of the remaining Japanese prisoners died of self-imposed starvation and was buried at sea.

The next day, the submarine sighted two ships with an escort. One was a freighter with a deck load of planes, and the other was a passenger-cargo. &quot;Trout&quot; fired a spread of three torpedoes at each of the targets. She saw and heard two hits on each. The freighter &quot;Ryotoku Maru&quot; sank stern first. Though depth charged afterwards and kept down for five hours, &quot;Trout&quot; surfaced and gave chase to the damaged transport, finding and attacking it with three more torpedoes before her escort could return.

As the transport was being abandoned &quot;Trout&quot; proceeded close aboard and passed 12 to 15 life boats. The enemy ship was ablaze and low in the water with her bow nearly awash. Sound heard a heavy explosion from &quot;Yamashiro Maru&quot; and, seven minutes later, &quot;Trout&quot; could see no trace of her. That night, the submarine set a course for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 October 1943.

The submarine was then routed back to the United States for a modernization overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard that included a complete rebuild of her conning tower, reduction of her silhouette by cutting down the fairwater, replacement of the 3&quot;/50 deck gun with a larger  piece, and installation of 18 additional bunks. She was ready for sea in January 1944 and returned to Submarine Division 162 at Pearl Harbor late that month.

===Final patrol and loss===
On 8 February 1944, the submarine began her 11th and final war patrol. &quot;Trout&quot; topped off with fuel at Midway Island and, on 16 February, headed via a great circle route toward the East China Sea.

Japanese records examined after the war indicate that one of their convoys, Matsu No. 1, was attacked by a submarine on 29 February 1944 in the patrol area assigned to &quot;Trout&quot;. Carrying the 29th Infantry Division of the Kwantung Army from Manchuria to Guam, Matsu No. 1 consisted of four large transports escorted by three &quot;Yūgumo&quot;-class destroyers of Destroyer Division 31: , , and . The submarine badly damaged one large passenger-cargo ship and sank the 7,126-ton transport &quot;Sakito Maru&quot;, which was carrying the Japanese 18th Infantry Regiment, including one of the subsequent Japanese holdouts Sakae Ōba. &quot;Asashimo&quot; detected the submarine and dropped 19 depth charges. Oil and debris came to the surface and the destroyer dropped a final depth charge on that spot, at the position . The submarine was using Mk. XVIII electric torpedoes, and it was also possible that one of those had made a circular run and sunk the boat, as happened with .

According to the US Navy Muster Reports in the National Archives, On 7 April 1944, &quot;Trout&quot; was declared presumed Missing in Action with all 81 hands. On 8 April 1945, &quot;Trout&quot; was declared presumed lost with all 81 hands including Clark and his executive officer, Lt. Harry Eades Woodworth, both of whom had made all 11 war patrols.

==In culture==

&quot;Trout&quot; is the subject of the second episode of the syndicated television anthology series &quot;The Silent Service&quot;. The episode entitled &quot;The Trout at the Rainbow&#x27;s End&quot; aired April 5, 1957, and was about the Corregidor mission.

<text>Urtica dioica, often known as common nettle, burn nettle, stinging nettle (although not all plants of this species sting) or nettle leaf, or just a nettle or stinger, is a herbaceous perennial flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. Originally native to Europe, much of temperate Asia and western North Africa, it is now found worldwide. The species is divided into six subspecies, five of which have many hollow stinging hairs called trichomes on the leaves and stems, which act like hypodermic needles, injecting histamine and other chemicals that produce a stinging sensation upon contact (&quot;contact urticaria&quot;, a form of contact dermatitis).

The plant has a long history of use as a source for traditional medicine, food, tea, and textile raw material in ancient (such as Saxon) and modern societies.

==Description==
&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; is a dioecious, herbaceous, and perennial plant. It grows to tall in the summer and dying down to the ground in winter. It has widely spreading rhizomes and stolons, which are bright yellow, as are the roots. The soft, green leaves are long and are borne oppositely on an erect, wiry, green stem. The leaves have a strongly serrated margin, a cordate base, and an acuminate tip with a terminal leaf tooth longer than adjacent laterals. It bears small, greenish or brownish, numerous flowers in dense axillary inflorescences.

The leaves and stems are very hairy with non-stinging hairs, and in most subspecies, also bear many stinging hairs (trichomes or spicules), whose tips come off when touched, transforming the hair into a needle that can inject several chemicals causing a painful sting or paresthesia, giving the species its common names: stinging nettle, burn-nettle, burn-weed, or burn-hazel.

==Taxonomy==

Credit for the scientific naming of &quot;Urtica dioica&quot; is given to Carl Linnaeus, who published it in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753. The taxonomy of &quot;Urtica&quot; species is confused, and sources are likely to use a variety of systematic names for these plants. Until 2014 there was broad consensus that the nettles native to the Americas, now classified as &quot;Urtica gracilis&quot;, were subspecies of &quot;U. dioica&quot;. However, in that year the paper &quot;Weeding the Nettles II&quot; was published in the journal &quot;Phytotaxa&quot; demonstrating the genetic distinctness of New World nettles. As of 2023 Plants of the World Online (POWO) recognizes &quot;U. gracilis&quot; as a distinct species while the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service PLANTS database continues to list it as &quot;U. dioica&quot; subsp. &quot;gracilis&quot;, as does the &quot;Flora of North America&quot;.

As of 2023 POWO recognizes 11 subspecies or varieties of &quot;U. dioica&quot;:

*&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; subsp. &quot;afghanica&quot; Chrtek, from southwestern and central Asia, sometimes has stinging hairs or is sometimes hairless.
*&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; subsp. &quot;dioica&quot; (European stinging nettle), from Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, has stinging hairs.
*&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; subsp. &quot;gansuensis&quot; C.J.Chen, from eastern Asia (China), has stinging hairs.
*&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; var. &quot;glabrata&quot; (Clem.) Asch. &amp; Graebn.
*&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; var. &quot;hispida&quot; (Lam. ex DC.) Tausch ex Ott

*&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; subsp. &quot;kurdistanica&quot; Chrtek
*&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; subsp. &quot;pubescens&quot;(Ledeb.) Domin, in many sources as &quot;U. dioica&quot; subsp. &quot;galeopsifolia&quot; (fen nettle or stingless nettle), from Europe, does not have stinging hairs.
*&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; var. &quot;sarmatica&quot; Zapał.
*&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; subsp. &quot;sondenii&quot;(Simmons) Hyl.
*&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; subsp. &quot;subinermis&quot; (R.Uechtr.) Weigend

===Etymology===
&quot;Urtica&quot; is derived from a Latin word meaning &#x27;sting&#x27;.

&quot;Dioica&quot; (δίοικος) is derived from Greek, meaning &#x27;of two houses&#x27; (having separate staminate and pistillate plants; dioecious).

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;U. dioica&quot; is considered to be native to Europe, much of temperate Asia and western North Africa. It is abundant in northern Europe and much of Asia, usually found in the countryside. It is less widespread in southern Europe and north Africa, where it is restricted by its need for moist soil, but is still common. It has been introduced to many other parts of the world. In North America, it is widely distributed in Canada and the United States, where it is found in every province and state except for Hawaii, and also can be found in northernmost Mexico. It grows in abundance in the Pacific Northwest, especially in places where annual rainfall is high. The European subspecies has been introduced into Australia, North America and South America.

In Europe, nettles have a strong association with human habitation and buildings. The presence of nettles may indicate the site of a long-abandoned building, and can also indicate soil fertility. Human and animal waste may be responsible for elevated levels of phosphate and nitrogen in the soil, providing an ideal environment for nettles.

==Ecology==
Nettles are the larval food plant for several species of butterflies, such as the peacock butterfly, comma (&quot;Polygonia c-album&quot;), and the small tortoiseshell. It is also eaten by the larvae of some moths including angle shades, buff ermine, dot moth, the flame, the gothic, grey chi, grey pug, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, mouse moth, setaceous Hebrew character, and small angle shades. The roots are sometimes eaten by the larva of the ghost moth (&quot;Hepialus humuli&quot;).

It is a known host to the pathogenic fungus &quot;Phoma herbarum&quot;.

Stinging nettle is particularly found as an understory plant in wetter environments, but it is also found in meadows. Although nutritious, it is not widely eaten by either wildlife or livestock, presumably because of the sting. It spreads by abundant seeds and also by rhizomes, and is often able to survive and re-establish quickly after fire.

==Cultivation==

===Field===

==== Sowing and planting ====
Three cultivation techniques can be used for the stinging nettle: 1) direct sowing, 2) growing seedlings in nurseries with subsequent transplantation and 3) vegetative propagation via stolons or head cuttings.

# Direct sowing: The seedbed should have a loose and fine structure, but should be reconsolidated using a packer roller imminently prior to sowing. Sowing time can be either in autumn or in spring. Seed density should be 6 kilograms/hectare with row spacing of and 42–50 cm in autumn and spring, respectively. The disadvantage of direct sowing is that it usually leads to incomplete plant coverage. This drawback can be mitigated by covering the seedbed with a transparent perforated foil in order to improve seed germination. Further, weed control can be problematic as the stinging nettle has a slow seedling development time.
# Growing seedlings: For this technique pre-germinated seeds are sown between mid-/end-February and beginning of April and grown in nurseries. Seedlings are grown in tuffs with 3–5 plants/tuff and a seed density of 1.2–1.6 kg/1000 tuffs. Faster germination is achieved by alternating high temperature during daytime (30 °C for 8 h) and lower temperature during nighttime (20 °C for 16 h). Before transplanting, the seedlings should be fertilized and acclimated to cold temperatures. Transplantation should start around Mid-April with row spacing of and plant spacing within rows of 25–30 cm.
# Vegetative propagation: Stolons (with several buds) of 10 cm should be planted from mid-April in a depth of . Head cuttings are grown in nurseries starting between mid-May and mid-June. Growing tips with two leaf pairs are cut from the mother plant and treated with root-growth inducing hormones. Transplantation can be delayed in comparison to the growing seedling technique.

=== Greenhouse ===
The stinging nettle can also be grown in controlled-environment agriculture systems, such as soil-less medium cultivations or aeroponics, which may achieve higher yields, standardize quality, and reduce harvesting costs and contamination.

==Sting and treatment==
&quot;Urtica dioica&quot; produces its inflammatory effect on skin (a stinging, burning sensation often called &quot;contact urticaria&quot;) both by impaling the skin via spicules – causing mechanical irritation – and by biochemical irritants, such as histamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine, among other chemicals. Anti-itch drugs, usually in the form of creams containing antihistamines or hydrocortisone, may provide relief from nettle dermatitis. The term &quot;contact urticaria&quot; has a wider use in dermatology, involving dermatitis caused by various skin irritants and pathogens. 

Docks, especially &quot;Rumex obtusifolius&quot; (the broad-leaf dock) often grow in similar environments to stinging nettles and are regarded as a folk remedy to counteract the sting of a nettle, although there is no evidence of any chemical effect. It may be that the act of rubbing a dock leaf against a nettle sting acts as a distracting counterstimulation, or that belief in the dock&#x27;s effect provides a placebo effect.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
&quot;U. dioica&quot; has a flavour similar to spinach when cooked. Young plants are harvested by many Native American communities and are cooked and eaten in spring when other food plants are scarce. Soaking stinging nettles in water or cooking removes the stinging chemicals from the plant, which allows them to be handled and eaten without injury. After the stinging nettle enters its flowering and seed-setting stages, the leaves develop gritty particles called cystoliths. Many sources claim consumption of these can irritate the kidneys and urinary tract, but there is no medical evidence to support this claim. Cystoliths are made of calcium carbonate, and will not dissolve when boiled. Leaves harvested post-flowering must have their cystoliths broken down by acid, as in the fermentation process. In its peak season, nettle contains up to 25% protein, dry weight, which is high for a leafy green vegetable. The leaves are also dried and may then be used to make a herbal tea, as can also be done with the nettle&#x27;s flowers.

Nettles can be used in a variety of recipes, such as polenta, pesto, and purée. Nettle soup is a common use of the plant, particularly in Northern and Eastern Europe.

Nettles are sometimes used in cheesemaking, such as for Cornish Yarg and as a flavouring in varieties of Gouda.

Nettles are used in Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the dough filling for the &quot;börek&quot; pastry. The top baby leaves are selected and simmered, and then mixed with other ingredients such as herbs and rice, before being used as a filling between dough layers. Similarly, in Greece the tender leaves are often used, after simmering, as a filling for hortopita, which is similar to spanakopita, but with wild greens rather than spinach for filling.

Young nettles can also be used to make an alcoholic drink.

====Competitive eating====
In the United Kingdom, an annual World Nettle Eating Championship draws thousands of people to Dorset, where competitors attempt to eat as much of the raw plant as possible. Competitors are given stalks of the plant, from which they strip the leaves and eat them. Whoever strips and eats the most stinging nettle leaves in a fixed time is the winner. The competition dates back to 1986, when two neighbouring farmers attempted to settle a dispute about which had the worst infestation of nettles, and one of them said to the other, &quot;I&#x27;ll eat any nettle of yours that&#x27;s longer than mine.&quot;

===Traditional medicine===
As Old English , nettle is one of the nine plants invoked in the pagan Anglo-Saxon &quot;Nine Herbs Charm&quot;, recorded in 10th-century traditional medicine. Nettle was believed to be a galactagogue – a substance that promotes lactation. Urtication, or flogging with nettles, is the process of deliberately applying stinging nettles to the skin to provoke inflammation. An agent thus used was considered to be a rubefacient (something that causes redness), used as a folk remedy for treating rheumatism. A study undertaken in 2000 showed that nettles were an effective therapy in relieving the pain of arthritis.

===Chastisement===
In indigenous justice systems in Ecuador, urtication was used as punishment for severe crimes in 2010. The sentenced perpetrator of a crime was flogged with stinging nettle, in public, naked, whilst being showered with freezing cold ice water.

===Textiles and fibre===
Nettle stems contain a bast fibre that has been traditionally used for the same purposes as linen and is produced by a similar retting process. Unlike cotton, nettles grow easily without pesticides. The fibres are coarser, however.

Historically, nettles have been used to make clothing for almost 3,000 years, as ancient nettle textiles from the Bronze Age have been found in Denmark. It is widely believed that German Army uniforms were almost all made from nettle during World War I due to a shortage of cotton, although there is little evidence to support this. More recently, companies in Austria, Germany, and Italy have started to produce commercial nettle textiles.

The fibre content in nettle shows a high variability and reaches from below 1% to 17%. Under middle-European conditions, stems yield typically between 45 and 55 dt / ha (decitons per hectare), which is comparable to flax stem yield. Due to the variable fibre content, the fibre yields vary between 0.2 and 7 dt / ha, but the yields are normally in the range between 2 and 4 dt / ha. Fibre varieties are normally cloning varieties and therefore planted from vegetative propagated plantlets. Direct seeding is possible, but leads to great heterogeneity in maturity.

Nettles may be used as a dye-stuff, producing yellow from the roots, or yellowish green from the leaves.

===Feed===
====Nutrient contents====
Fresh leaves contain approximately 82.4% water, 17.6% dry matter, 5.5% protein, 0.7 to 3.3% fat, and 7.1% carbohydrates. Mature leaves contain about 40% &quot;α&quot;- linolenic acid, a valuable omega-3 acid. For exact fatty acid contents see Table 1. Seeds contain much more fatty acid than leaves.

Minerals (Ca, K, Mg, P, Si, S, Cl) and trace elements (Ti, 80 ppm, Mn, Cu, Fe) contents depend mostly on the soil and the season.

Carotenoids can be found primarily in the leaves, where different forms of lutein, xanthophyll and carotene are present (Table 2). Some carotenes are precursors of vitamin A (retinol), their retinol equivalents RE or retinol activity equivalents per g dry weight are 1.33 for mature leaves and 0.9 for young leaves. Nettle contains much less carotenes and retinol than carrots, which contain 8.35 RE per g fresh weight. Depending on the batch and the leaf and stem content, nettle contains only traces of zeaxanthin or between 20–60 mg/kg of dry matter. Nettle contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C), riboflavin (vitamin B2), pantothenic acid, vitamin K1 and tocopherols (vitamin E). The highest vitamin contents can be found in the leaves.

====Poultry: Egg yolk colouring in laying hens====
In laying hens, nettle can be used as an egg yolk colourant instead of artificial pigments or other natural pigments (derived from marigold for yellow). Nettle has high carotenoid contents, especially lutein, and zeaxanthin, of which lutein and zeaxanthin act as yellow pigments. Feeding as little as 6.25 g dry nettle per kg feed is as effective as the synthetic pigments to colour the egg yolk. Feeding nettle has no detrimental effect on the performance of the laying hens or on the general quality of eggs.

====Ruminants====
Ruminants avoid fresh stinging nettles; however, if the nettles are wilted or dry, voluntary intake can be high.

===Use in agriculture / horticulture===
In the European Union, nettle extract can be used as an insecticide, fungicide, and acaricide under Basic Substance regulations. As an insecticide, nettle extract can be used for the control of codling moth, diamondback moth, and spider mites. As a fungicide, it can be used for the control of &quot;Pythium&quot; root rot, powdery mildew, early blight, late blight, &quot;Septoria&quot; blight, &quot;Alternaria&quot; leaf spot, and grey mould.

===Gardening===
Nettles have a number of uses in the vegetable garden, including the potential for encouraging beneficial insects. Since nettles prefer to grow in phosphorus-rich and nitrogen rich soils that have recently been disturbed (and thus aerated), the growth of nettles is an indicator that an area has high fertility (especially phosphate and nitrate), and thus is an indicator to gardeners as to the quality of the soil.

Nettles contain nitrogenous compounds, so are used as a compost activator or can be used to make a liquid fertilizer, which although low in phosphate, is useful in supplying magnesium, sulphur, and iron. They are also one of the few plants that can tolerate, and flourish in, soils rich in poultry droppings.

The stinging nettle is the red admiral caterpillar&#x27;s primary host plant and can attract migrating red admiral butterflies to a garden. &quot;U. dioica&quot; can be a troubling weed, and mowing can increase plant density. Regular and persistent tilling will greatly reduce its numbers, and the use of herbicides such as and glyphosate are effective control measures.

==In culture==
In Great Britain and Ireland, &quot;U. dioica&quot; and the annual nettle &quot;Urtica urens&quot; are the only common stinging plants and have found a place in several figures of speech in the English language. Shakespeare&#x27;s Hotspur urges that &quot;out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety&quot; (&quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, Act II Scene 3). The figure of speech &quot;to grasp the nettle&quot; probably originated from Aesop&#x27;s fable &quot;The Boy and the Nettle&quot;. In Seán O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;, one of the characters quotes Aesop &quot;Gently touch a nettle and it&#x27;ll sting you for your pains/Grasp it as a lad of mettle and soft as silk remains&quot;. The metaphor may refer to the fact that if a nettle plant is grasped firmly rather than brushed against, it does not sting so readily, because the hairs are crushed down flat and do not penetrate the skin so easily.

In the German language, the idiom , or to sit in nettles, means to get into trouble. In Germanic mythology, the God of thunder, Thor, was associated with nettles, and that&#x27;s where the saying &quot;lightning won&#x27;t strike into nettles&quot; comes from. The idiom is used in Croatian, Hungarian, Serbian, and many other Indo-European languages. In Dutch, a &#x27; means a predicament. In French, the idiom &#x27; (do not push granny into the nettles) means that we should be careful not to abuse a situation. The name urticaria for hives comes from the Latin name of nettle (&quot;&quot;, from urere, to burn).

The English word &#x27;nettled&#x27;, meaning irritated or angry, is derived from &#x27;nettle&#x27;.

There is a common idea in Great Britain that the nettle was introduced by the Romans, but Plant Atlas 2020 treats it as native. The idea of its introduction was mentioned by William Camden in his book &quot;Britannia&quot; of 1586. However, in 2011, an early Bronze Age burial cist on Whitehorse Hill, Dartmoor, Devon, was excavated. The cist dated from between 1730 and 1600&quot; &quot;BC. It contained various high value beads as well as fragments of a sash made from nettle fibre. It is possible that the sash was traded from mainland Europe, but perhaps more probable that it was locally made.

<doc id="430385" wikidata="Q688646" url="?curid=430385" title="Freedom to roam">
<text>The freedom to roam, or everyone&#x27;s right, every person&#x27;s right or everyman&#x27;s right, is the general public&#x27;s right to access certain public or privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for recreation and exercise. The right is sometimes called the right of public access to the wilderness or the right to roam.

In Austria, Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland and the Czech Republic, the freedom to roam takes the form of general public rights which are sometimes codified in law. The access is ancient in parts of Northern Europe and has been regarded as sufficiently fundamental that it was not formalised in law until modern times. However, the right usually does not include any substantial economic exploitation, such as hunting or logging, or disruptive activities, such as making fires and driving offroad vehicles.

In countries without such general rights, there may be a network of rights of way, or some nature reserves with footpaths.

==Foreshore==

Public rights of way frequently exist on the foreshore of beaches. In legal discussions the foreshore is often referred to as the &quot;wet-sand area&quot;.

For privately owned beaches in the United States, some states such as Massachusetts use the low water mark as the dividing line between the property of the State and that of the beach owner. Other states such as California use the high-water mark.

In the UK, the foreshore is generally deemed to be owned by the Crown although there are notable exceptions, especially what are termed &quot;several fisheries&quot; which can be historic deeds to title, dating back to King John&#x27;s time or earlier, and the Udal Law, which applies generally in Orkney and Shetland. While in the rest of Britain ownership of land extends only to the High water mark, and The Crown is deemed to own what lies below it, in Orkney and Shetland it extends to the lowest Spring ebb.
Where the foreshore is owned by the Crown the public has access below the line marking high tide.

In Greece, according to the L. 2971/01, the foreshore zone is defined as the area of the coast which might be reached by the maximum climbing of the waves on the coast (maximum wave run-up on the coast) in their maximum capacity (maximum referring to the “usually maximum winter waves” and of course not to exceptional cases, such as tsunamis etc.). The foreshore zone, apart from the exceptions in the law, is public, and permanent constructions are not allowed on it.

As with the dry sand part of a beach, legal and political disputes can arise over the ownership and public use of the foreshore. One recent example is the New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy involving the land claims of the Māori people. However, the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 guarantees free public access.

==Government-owned land==

The public has the right to access some but not all government-owned land. Wilderness areas are typically open for recreational use outside of military facilities. Some land owned by the government because it would otherwise be legally unowned is claimed as the territory of Indigenous people, in countries that were colonised.

===Crown land in Canada===
Much of Canada is Crown land owned by the provinces. Some is leased for commercial activity, such as forestry or mining, but on much of it there is free access for recreational activities like hiking, cycling, canoeing, cross-country skiing, horse back riding, and licensed hunting and fishing, etc. At the same time access can be restricted or limited for various reasons (e.g., to protect public safety or resources, including the protection of wild plants and animals).
In the Canadian Territories Crown land is administered by the Canadian Federal Government. Canadian National Parks have been created from Crown land and are also administered by the Federal Government. There are also provincial parks and nature reserves that have been similarly created. The Indigenous peoples in Canada may have specific rights on Crown land established under treaties signed when Canada was a British colony, and have claimed ownership of some Crown land.

===Crown land in Australia===
Much of Australia&#x27;s land area, including most land below the mean high water mark is Crown land, which is administered by the Australian states. Much consists of pastoral leases, land owned and run by Aboriginal people (e.g. APY lands), and &quot;unallocated&quot; Crown land. Access to the latter is normally permitted for recreational purposes, though motorized vehicles are required to follow roads and to be registered and insured.

===Public land in the US===
Most state and federally managed public lands are open for recreational use. Recreation opportunities depend on the managing agency, and run the gamut from the free-for-all, undeveloped wide open spaces of the Bureau of Land Management lands to the highly developed and controlled US national parks and state parks. Wildlife refuges and state wildlife management areas, managed primarily to improve habitat, are generally open to wildlife watching, hiking, and hunting, except for closures to protect mating and nesting, or to reduce stress on wintering animals. National forests generally have a mix of maintained trails and roads, wilderness and undeveloped portions, and developed picnic and camping areas.

==Criticism==
In recent years increased mobility and affluence has made previously remote areas more accessible and though significant harm or damage is unusual, endangered species are being disturbed, and litter left, by some recreational users.

Helena Jonsson, the President of the Federation of Swedish Farmers, argued in 2011 that the way land was used had changed and that the law was out of date and needed to be revised, so as &quot;to bar commercial interests from using the law as an excuse to make a profit while they are on other people&#x27;s private property&quot;.

==By area==
===Europe===
====Nordic countries====
Ancient traces provide evidence of the freedom to roam in many European countries, suggesting such a freedom was once a common norm. Today, the right to roam has survived in perhaps its purest form in Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Here the right has been won through practice over hundreds of years and it is not known when it changed from mere &#x27;common practice&#x27; to become a commonly recognised right.
Today these rights underpin opportunities for outdoor recreation in several of the Nordic countries, providing the opportunity to hike across or camp on another&#x27;s land (e.g. in Sweden for one or two nights), boating on someone else&#x27;s waters, and picking wildflowers, mushrooms and berries. However, with these rights come responsibilities; that is, an obligation neither to harm, disturb, litter, nor to damage wildlife or crops.

Access rights are most often for travel on foot. Rights to fish, hunt or take any other product are usually constrained by other customs or laws. Building a fire is often prohibited (though in Sweden and Norway fires are allowed with proper safety precautions). Making noise is discouraged. In some countries, putting up a tent in the forest for one night is allowed, but not the use of a caravan. Access does not extend to built up or developed land (such as houses, gardens) and does not necessarily include commercial exploitation of the land. For example, workers picking berries may be legal only with the landowner&#x27;s permission.

There are some significant differences in the rules of different countries. In Denmark, there is a more restricted freedom to roam on privately held land. All dunes and beaches and all publicly owned forests are open to roaming. Uncultivated, unfenced areas are open to daytime roaming irrespective of ownership status. Privately owned forest have access by roads and tracks only.

=====Finland=====
In Finland, &quot; in Finnish (everyone&#x27;s right) has replaced the older term &quot; (every man&#x27;s right) to refer to the freedom to roam and related rights. The term in Swedish is &quot;&quot; (lit. &quot;everyone&#x27;s right&quot;), similar to other Nordic countries.

The right is not codified in any specific law. Instead, it arises from the principle of &quot;nulla poena sine lege&quot; - what is not illegal cannot be punished. Things that are not explicitly disallowed, are allowed by default.

Everyone may walk, ski, ride a horse or cycle freely in the countryside where this does not harm the natural environment or the landowner, except in gardens or in the immediate vicinity of people&#x27;s homes (yards). Fields and plantations, which may easily be harmed, may usually not be crossed except in the winter. It is also possible to establish outdoor recreation routes on private land, based on an agreement on the rights of use or by official proceedings in accordance with the Outdoor Recreation Act, for example.

One may stay or set up camp temporarily in the countryside, a reasonable distance from homes, pick mineral samples, wild berries, mushrooms and flowers (as long as they are not protected species). One may fish with a rod and line (only still waters), row, sail or use a motorboat on waterways (with certain restrictions), and swim or bathe in both inland waters and the sea. One can walk, ski and ice fish on frozen lakes, rivers and the sea. Income from selling picked berries or mushrooms is tax-free. Picking cloudberry may be temporarily restricted to local residents in parts of Lapland. In the autonomous province of Åland the right to camp&#x27;s inclusion in the right to roam was disputed, but since 2013 this is no longer the case.

When traveling with a motorhome or camper, one can park and spend the night anywhere parking is allowed, including along public roads. Checking parking area signs is essential to ensure compliance with overnight stay regulations. Private and forest roads can serve as suitable parking spots, as long as there are no signage restrictions. Off-road driving requires landowner permission, but parking off-road near the road is allowed for convenience. Overnight stays are generally prohibited in shopping center parking lots, but service stations often provide suitable facilities. When visiting national parks, designated areas or parking lots may allow overnight stays, potentially requiring a permit. Nature reserves have specific rules regarding overnight stays.

One may not disturb others or damage property, disturb breeding birds (or their nests or young), or disturb reindeer or game animals. One may not cut down or damage living trees, or collect wood, moss or lichen on other people&#x27;s property, nor may one light open fires without the landowner&#x27;s permission (except in an emergency). It is acceptable, however, to use an alcohol burner, wood stove or similar device that has no hot parts touching the ground. One may not disturb the privacy of people&#x27;s homes by camping too near to them or making too much noise, nor litter, drive motor vehicles off-road without the landowner&#x27;s permission, or fish (excluding angling) or hunt without the relevant permits. If horse riding causes more than a minor inconvenience or disturbance, an agreement for the long term use of the route must be made with the landowner. A horse may also be taken to swim in a water body without the consent of the owner of the water area (excluding public beaches).

=====Norway=====
Everyone in Norway enjoys the right of access to, and passage through, uncultivated land in the countryside. The right is an old consuetudinary law called the &quot;allemannsrett&quot; (lit. the everyman&#x27;s right), that was codified in 1957 with the implementation of the Outdoor Recreation Act. It is based on respect for the countryside, and all visitors are expected to show consideration for farmers and landowners, other users and the environment. In Norway the terms &quot;utmark&quot; and &quot;innmark&quot; divide areas where the right to roam is valid (&quot;utmark&quot;, literally something like &quot;land outside [the boundaries]&quot;/&quot;[Out Field]&quot;) and where it is invalid or restricted (&quot;innmark&quot;, &quot;land inside [the boundaries]&quot;/&quot;[In Field]&quot;). The law specifies &quot;innmark&quot; thoroughly, and all areas not covered by this definition are defined as &quot;utmark&quot;, generally speaking uninhabited and uncultivated areas. Cultivated land may only be crossed when frozen or covered in snow.

There are some basic rules that must be followed when camping in Norway:

* People are allowed to camp at least 150 metres away from the nearest inhabited house or cottage.
* Campfires are not allowed in the forest areas between 15 April to 15 September, unless it &quot;obviously can not lead to a fire&quot;.
* Tourists are allowed to stay in one spot for up to two days. After that, it is necessary to specifically ask for permission from the landowner. This rule excludes the mountains and the national parks.
* With a motorhome or a camper, it is allowed to park and spend the night anywhere parking is allowed, including along a public road, unless camping is explicitly forbidden. Often this right is however limited to one or two overnight stays.

In later years the right has come under pressure particularly around the Oslo Fjord and in popular areas of Southern Norway. These areas are popular sites for holiday homes and many owners of coastal land want to restrict public access to their property. As a general rule, building and partitioning of property is prohibited in a 100-metre zone closest to the sea, but local authorities in many areas have made liberal use of their ability to grant exemptions from this rule. However, even if a land owner has been permitted to build closer to the shore, he may not restrict people from walking along the shore. Fences and other barriers to prevent public access are not permitted (but yet sometimes erected, resulting in heavy fines).

Canoeing, kayaking, rowing and sailing in rivers, lakes, and ocean are allowed. Motorised boats are only permitted in salt water. All waters are open for swimming – with the exception of lakes that are drinking water reservoirs (see for instance Maridalsvannet).

Wild berry foraging is part of the right. Picking cloudberries may, however, be restricted on privately owned land in northern parts of Norway.

Hunting rights belong to the landowner, and thus hunting is not included in the right of free access. In freshwater areas such as rivers and lakes, the fishing rights belong to the landowner. Freshwater fishing may only be conducted with the permission of the landowner and by those in possession of a fishing licence. Different rules apply for children under the age of 16. Children under the age of 16 have the right to fish without a licence, a right codified in 1992. This right was tried and upheld in a ruling from the Norwegian Supreme Court in 2004. 

In salt water areas there is free access to sports fishing using boats or from the shoreline. All fishing is subject to legislation to, among other things, protect biological diversity, and this legislation stipulates rules regarding the use of gear, seasons, bag or size limits and more.

=====Sweden=====
In Sweden (lit. &quot;the everyman&#x27;s right&quot;) is a freedom granted by the Constitution of Sweden. Since 1994 the Instrument of Government says that notwithstanding the right to own property &quot;everyone shall have access to nature in accordance with &quot;allemansrätten&quot;&quot;. What this means is not further explicated on in the constitution, and only sparsely in other legislation. In practice, &quot;allemansrätten&quot; is defined as actions that are not crimes, will not make a person liable to pay damages, nor can be prohibited by any authority. As in other Nordic countries, the Swedish right to roam comes with an equal emphasis being placed upon the responsibility to look after the countryside; the maxim is &quot;do not disturb, do not destroy&quot;. Many Swedish people consider this to be a form of legacy or human right.

&quot;Allemansrätten&quot; gives a person the right to access, walk, cycle, ride, ski, and camp on any land—with the exception of private gardens, the immediate vicinity of a dwelling house and land under cultivation. Restrictions apply for nature reserves and other protected areas. It also gives the right to pick wild flowers, mushrooms and berries (provided they are not legally protected), but not to hunt in any way. Swimming in any lake and putting an unpowered boat on any water is permitted unless explicitly forbidden. Visiting beaches and walking by a shoreline is permitted, providing it is not a part of a garden or within the immediate vicinity of a residence (legally defined as the &quot;hemfridszon&quot;). The &quot;hemfridszon&#x27;s&quot; size depends on conditions but can be as large as 70 metres from an ordinary dwelling house. To better protect access to water and the right to walk along beaches, it is since 1975 generally not permitted to build a new house near (generally 100 m) from a beach and/or shoreline.

Fishing remains essentially private—apart from on the biggest five lakes and the coast of the Baltic Sea, the Sound, Kattegat and Skagerrak. It is permitted to drive a car on a private road unless explicitly signposted otherwise. Small camp fires are generally permitted, but in some periods banned by local authorities due to wild fire risk. It is allowed to put up a tent on any uncultivated land for a night or two. There has been some controversy on commercial use of the berry picking rights, when companies legally contract people to pick berries in the forests.

Building a fire is generally permitted except on bare rock faces where it can lead to cracking. Municipalities can issue fire bans during dry periods.

With a motorhome or camper, you can park and spend the night anywhere parking is allowed, including along public roads. Driving off-road with caravans and mobile homes is not permitted. At rest areas, the usual maximum stay for overnight stays is around 24 hours on weekdays, with slightly longer durations on weekends. Additional rules will be posted on rest area signs. There are no specific regulations regarding how long you can park your motor vehicle adjacent to a non-off-road road.

Exercise of the rights is overseen by the County Administrative Boards—which can, for example, force the removal of a fence if it obstructs access to areas that are important to the &quot;allemansrätt&quot;.

=====Iceland=====
Like other Nordic countries Icelandic law contains a version of the freedom to roam, the right to access uncultivated land and pick berries. &quot;It is permissible to cross uncultivated private property without seeking any special permission, but landowners may limit routes with signs or other marks. State-owned land such as conservation areas and forestry areas are open to everyone with few exceptions. These exceptions include – but are not limited to – access during breeding seasons or during sensitive growth periods&quot;.

Hikers should, however, &quot;avoid taking shortcuts over fenced areas, pastures and private plots&quot;, and follow the rules in conservation areas. Footpaths should also be followed, if they exist, to help protect the landscape. Furthermore, &quot;landowners may not hinder passage of walkers alongside rivers, lakes and ocean, or on tracks and paths&#x27;. Cycling may be restricted on some paths. Equestrians must keep to bridleways where they exist and in other places show &quot;consideration for the land&quot;.

In many areas, like South and East Iceland, only in uninhabited areas that are not protected maximum 3 Tents maybe pitched up for one night, if there is no camp-site in vicinity.

Motorized travellers with motorhomes (RV), camping cars (campers) and trailers must always stay on an official campsite. 

In national parks, it is forbidden to stay overnight outside an official camp-site, both for motorized and non-motorized travellers.

Fishing requires a license but collecting &quot;berries, mushrooms, seaweed and other plants for immediate consumption&quot; is permitted on &quot;public lands and highland pastures&quot;.

====Estonia====
In Estonia, it is permitted to access natural and cultural landscapes on foot, by bicycle, ski, boat, or on horseback.

Private property may be accessed at any time. If the private property is fenced or posted against trespassing, the permission of the owner is required to proceed. The owner of the private property is also required to post signs stating the ownership of the land, and contact numbers, to avoid legal issues.
Land owners may not block access to land, roads or bodies of water that are public or are designated for public use, including ice and shore paths.

All bodies of water that are public or designated for public use have public shore paths that are up to 4 m wide. The shore path along a navigable body of water may extend to a distance of 10 m from the water line. The owner may not close this path even if the private property is posted or marked with no-trespassing signs. Grazing areas and other enclosed areas along the shore paths must have stiles.
Ponds with no outlet located entirely on the land of one land owner and lakes smaller than five hectares located on land belonging to more than one land owner shall not be in public use. Permission from the landowner is required to access such bodies of water.

Neither do bodies of water protected as sources of drinking water or which are in use by aquaculture or are in other special use have a shore path.
All of the rights and responsibilities regarding humans’ interaction with nature are collectively termed everyman&#x27;s right. Everyman&#x27;s right does not pertain to the organizing of sporting events or other public events in open country. To organize these, the permission of the landowners or other possessors of land, and if necessary, of the local government, must be sought.

The following is permitted in nature:

* accessing areas by foot, on bicycle, skis, boat or horseback in all places not prohibited on the basis of law(s);
* being present in any area where access is permitted;
* gathering wild berries, mushrooms, flowers, medicinal plants, hazelnuts and other natural products not under nature protection;
* fishing bodies of water that are public or designated for public use with a simple hand line.

The following is prohibited:

* accessing the immediate proximity of a person&#x27;s yard, plantations, apiaries, sown crops, grain field and other cropland where damage is thereby incurred by the owner;
* lighting fires and camping without permission from the land owner or possessor;
* hunting and fishing without relevant license, except for simple hand line;
* injuring trees and bushes;
* disrupting the peace of local inhabitants;
* damaging the habitats and nests of forest animals and birds, gathering or removing their eggs, or otherwise doing harm to them;
* damaging nature protection objects and protected species;
* using motor vehicles where prohibited;
* polluting nature.

====Belarus====
Article 13 of Section I of the Constitution of Belarus guarantees that all forest and farm land is publicly owned.
Forty percent of the country&#x27;s territory is covered by forest,
and approximately the same amount devoted to agriculture.

According to the Forest Code (Article 13) &quot;citizens have the right to freely stay in the forest and collect wild fruits, berries, nuts, mushrooms, other food, forest resources and medicinal plants to meet their own needs.&quot;

====Austria====
The right to roam in Austria, particularly in forests and mountainous areas, is called Wegefreiheit. Since 1975 the right to roam in forests is guaranteed by Federal law. In particular, walking, running, hiking, and resting are automatically allowed to the public in most forest areas. However, horse riding, bike riding, and camping are not, and may only be practised with the land owner&#x27;s permission. A large proportion of the forest area in Austria is owned by government bodies such as the , but the same restrictions still apply. In some circumstances forests may be closed to the public for environmental reasons. The situation in mountainous areas is less clear, and differs from state to state. Some states, such as Carinthia, Styria, and Salzburg guarantee a right to roam in mountainous areas (usually defined as above the tree line), for all recreational activities. In other states, such as Tyrol, Lower Austria, and Burgenland, no explicit right to roam exists and land owners reserve the right to deny access. In practice, however, such restrictions are rarely enforced, since mountain tourism is an important industry in Austria.
====Czech Republic====


The old legal institute of &quot;right of the way&quot; (imbedded in the Civil Code) has its roots in Austria-Hungary law. This legal institution is applied when one land owner has a need to go through alien lands for access to his own land.

The Nature and Countryside Preservation Act gives a legal right to roam through country (&quot;veřejná přístupnost krajiny&quot;, public accessibility of countryside or wilderness – excluding parcels owned by a natural person). Some types of land are excluded from compulsory public accessibility: settled and building grounds, courtyards, gardens, orchards, vineyards, hop gardens, grounds destined for animal husbandry. Fields and arable land are excluded during seasons when herbage or soil would be damaged, pasture lands are excluded during cattle grazing.
In national natural preserves, national natural monuments, national parks and in the first zones of landscape protected areas, state authorities can restrict public access (ordinarily only to roads or only to marked routes). Special acts can exclude also other areas (e. g. military areas, rail tracks etc.).

According to Forest Act, forests are publicly accessible (&quot;obecné užívání lesa&quot;, common use of forest – including private ones) and citizens have a legal right to enter the forests. The right of gathering dry twigs lying on the ground and berries for personal purpose is also guaranteed. However, biking, sledge riding, skiing and horseback riding are allowed only on forest roads. Public motor vehicle riding is prohibited (highroads going through forest are not considered as parts of the forest – because they are not considered as &quot;forest land&quot; in land registration). Common use of forest can be restricted by the owner in military forests, protected areas, forest nurseries, forest orchards, deer parks, pheasantries etc.

The Road Act defines &quot;obecné užívání pozemních komunikací&quot; (common use of roads – some road can be excluded), The Water Act defines &quot;obecné užívání povrchových vod&quot; (common use of surface waters).

====Italy====

In Italy there is not a general right to roam: this was established by jurisprudence in 1999 (Cassazione civile, sez. III, 27/08/1999, n. 8997). Privately-owned land is not accessible when marked as such, while access to publicly-owned land is generally free. Berries and mushrooms can be picked on publicly-owned land but may be restricted in quantity/species and/or subjected to a fee, according to regional laws.

It can be estimated that only half of the country&#x27;s beaches are freely accessible and usable for bathing. In fact, almost 43% of the Italian sandy coastline is occupied by bathing establishments, while 7.2% is polluted or not monitored. 
The situation varies from region to region; although the European Union has been asking Italy for years to have more free beaches, the number of free beaches has declined.

====Switzerland====
The freedom to roam is guaranteed in Switzerland by the Swiss Civil Code. However, some cantons have more detailed regulations concerning the rights of access of otherwise not authorised people.

The Swiss Civil Code provides that forest and pasture are accessible freely for everyone, as long as there is no excessive usage. Except in special cases like the protection of young forest or biotopes it is not allowed to fence in forest areas. This also applies to private property. Certain activities related to excessive usage and the potential to cause damage, such as events in the woods, or access with cars, may be dependent on special authorisation. Similar regulations are in place for land which is not usable (e.g. stretches of water, rock, snow and ice), regardless of the land being unowned (i.e. being under the control of the canton and not able to be claimed as private property) or privately owned. The canton may also choose to restrict the freedom to roam in order to protect nature (e.g. the gathering of mushrooms, berries, wood, etc. in forests).

====Germany====
In Germany a limited right to roam, called &quot;Betretungsrecht&quot;, is guaranteed by multiple federal laws. The Federal Nature Conservation Act, the Federal Forest Act and the Federal Water Management Act allow everyone access to open landscape, uncultivated land, forests and water bodies, including cycling and horse-riding on tracks and paths. The right may be further regulated through state law.

The Constitution of Bavaria guarantees everyone &quot;the enjoyment of natural beauty and recreation in the outdoors, in particular the access to forests and mountain meadows, the use of waterways and lakes and the appropriation of wild fruits&quot;. The right is nicknamed &quot;Schwammerlparagraph&quot; (mushroom clause). The article also obliges &quot;every person to treat nature and the landscape with care&quot;. &quot;The state and the municipalities shall be entitled and obliged to maintain free access to mountains, lakes, rivers and other beautiful sceneries and to create free access by restricting property rights and to create hiking trails and recreational parks&quot;.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, outside Scotland, access to much uncultivated and unenclosed land was restricted prior to the enactment of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Access to land in England and Wales is still more limited than in most of Northern Europe, and some other European countries, while access is very limited in Northern Ireland. Property was formerly protected in England and Wales mostly to preserve the landowner&#x27;s hunting or fishing rights. The Ramblers&#x27; Association, which works to increase the rights of walkers in the United Kingdom, was a driving force behind this legislation.

=====England and Wales=====

In England and Wales, after a polarised debate about the merits, rights and benefits of private landowners and public recreation, in 2000 the Government legislated to introduce a limited &quot;right to roam&quot;, without compensation for landowners. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW) was gradually implemented from 2000 onwards to give the general public the conditional right to walk in certain areas of the English and Welsh countryside: principally downland, moorland, heathland and coastal land. Forests and woodlands are excluded, other than publicly owned forests, which have a similar right of access by virtue of a voluntary dedication made by the Forestry Commission. Developed land, gardens and certain other areas are specifically excluded from the right of access. Agricultural land is accessible if it falls within one of the categories described above. People exercising the right of access have certain duties to respect other people&#x27;s rights to manage the land, and to protect nature.

The new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced. This added to the legal right to use established public footpaths and bridleways, some common land and access to the foreshore. Land owners may prevent access to other areas (or charge a fee for access).

Angling interests successfully lobbied for the exclusion of rivers in England and Wales from CROW, leaving other river users such as swimmers and canoeists with access restricted to less than 2% of navigable water. The British Canoe Union is running the Rivers Access Campaign, to highlight the level of restrictions the public face in gaining access to inland waterways in England and Wales.

Since the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985, much of the Dartmoor National Park has been designated as &quot;access land&quot;, with no restrictions on where walkers can roam, although it remains privately owned. Because of the 1985 act, Dartmoor was largely unaffected by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which established similar rights in other rural parts of the country, but in 2006, this act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers.

The Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 extended access rights to land near the English coast.

=====Scotland=====

In Scotland the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 comprehensively codified into Scots law the ancient tradition of the right to universal access to the land in Scotland. The act specifically establishes a right to be on land for recreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross land. The rights exist only if they are exercised responsibly, to which the Scottish Outdoor Access Code provides guidance on.

Access rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming.
The rights confirmed in the Scottish legislation are greater than the limited rights of access created in England and Wales by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW).

=====Northern Ireland=====
Access rights in Northern Ireland have been described as being &quot;the most regressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe. Most of the routes used to reach[...] mountains, hills, seashores, rivers and national monuments pass over private land. In almost all cases, the walker has no right to be there.&quot; The Access to the Countryside (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 gave some rights, but access is generally modelled on the restrictive 1949 English/Welsh law. The absence of a tradition of access, political influence of landowners and problems of governance have been blamed for the lack of freedom to roam.

====Republic of Ireland====
Keep Ireland Open is a voluntary campaign organisation with the aim of improving access to the countryside. Journalist Fintan O&#x27;Toole called Irish law &quot;perhaps the most negative and mean-minded regime for walkers in Europe&quot;. Access rights in Ireland have been described as being &quot;the most regressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe. Most of the routes used to reach our mountains, hills, seashores, rivers and national monuments pass over private land. In almost all cases, the walker has no right to be there.&quot; The national parks are described by Keep Ireland Open as &quot;the only places in Ireland where freedom to roam exists&quot;, but they only cover 0.9% of the country. Comhairle na Tuaithe was established by Éamon Ó Cuív, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2004 to mediate between landowners, state agencies and recreational users of the countryside.

===North America===
====United States====
Because American property rights include the right to exclude others, the freedom to roam does not generally exist in the United States. But under some circumstances, long-term use of a path across private property may legally establish a prescriptive easement for the public. On federally owned property, the Property Clause of Article IV, Section III of the U.S. Constitution states that the United States Congress &quot;shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States&quot;, granting the legislative branch the authority to regulate federal property &quot;without limitations&quot;.

In the United States, governmental entities including cities, counties, states, and the federal government all manage land which are referred to as either public lands or the public domain. The majority of public lands in the United States are administered by the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, agencies of the federal government, and include about 640 million acres of land, about 28% of the total land area of 2.27 billion acres. Any person, including non-citizens, can legally access and recreate on these lands lawfully, sometimes referred to as the North American model of land conservation. Some state and local governments enforce stricter policies on their public land, such as loitering laws and redlining practices, with some cities outright banishing certain groups of people. Here are some specific state and local policies:

* California&#x27;s California Coastal Act provides a similar right for its beaches, and the Surfrider Foundation has been successful suing littoral property owners who try to use trespassing laws to restrict public access to the public portions of a beach.
* Florida&#x27;s state constitution establishes a public trust of &quot;sovereignty lands&quot;, including wet beaches &quot;below mean high water lines ... for all the people,&quot; respecting a freedom to roam there, regardless of any private neighboring dry beach. Local ordinances typically limit this freedom strictly to roaming on foot, and prohibit driving motor vehicles or beaching boats.
* The State of Hawaii grants beach and coastal access to local residents and visitors. These &quot;beach transit corridors&quot; are considered public property defined as the &quot;areas extending seaward of the shoreline&quot;. Coastal land owners are also required to maintain vegetation that would inhibit beach access as there are many varieties of fast growing coastal plants that can easily limit public access.
* Maine allows access to any outdoor property unless posted. Posting requires clearly marking with complying signs or paint. Signs must indicate that access is prohibited, that access is prohibited without permission of the landowner or the landowner&#x27;s agent, or that access for a particular purpose is prohibited.
* In St. Louis, Missouri, the government banishes many homeless people and other vulnerable populations from large areas of the city. These areas include public land and many of the organizations that provide shelter, meals, and care to St. Louis’s homeless people. Those who violate the orders have been jailed for months.
* New Hampshire common law gives members of the public the right to access unposted land.
* The Oregon Beach Bill was a piece of landmark legislation in the U.S. state of Oregon, passed by the 1967 session of the Oregon Legislature. It established public ownership of land along the Oregon Coast from the water up to sixteen vertical feet above the low tide mark.
* In Pennsylvania, the 1966 Recreational Use of Land and Water Act (RULWA) limits landowners&#x27; liability for personal injury and property damage if they make their land available to the public for recreation. The statute encourages landowners to open their undeveloped land for recreational use.
* The constitution of Rhode Island protects shore access, including swimming and gathering of seaweed. The 1982 Rhode Island Supreme Court decision in &quot;State v. Ibbison&quot; defines the end of private land as the mean high tide line, which is difficult to determine in day-to-day activities, and has resulted in beach access conflicts. Underfunding of the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council has resulted in lax enforcement against encroachment on public access and building of illegal structures.
* Vermont&#x27;s constitution allows the public the right to hunt, fish and trap on open private land. A landowner who does not want to allow this access has a legal right to post signs that restrict this right.

====Canada====
Much of Canada is Crown land administered by the provinces and territories. Some is leased for commercial activity, such as forestry or mining, but on much of it there is free access for recreational activities like hiking, cycling, canoeing, cross-country skiing, horse back riding, and licensed hunting and fishing, etc. At the same time access can be restricted or limited for various reasons (e.g., to protect public safety or resources, including the protection of wild plants and animals).
Canadian National Parks have been created from Crown land and are administered by the Canadian Federal Government. There are also provincial parks and nature reserves that have been similarly created. The Indigenous peoples in Canada may have specific rights on Crown land established under treaties signed when Canada was a British colony, and have claimed ownership of some Crown land.

In Ontario, Canadian citizens and people who have lived in Canada for at least 7 months of the preceding 12-month period are allowed to camp for free up to 21 days on any one site in a calendar year, on crown land/conservation reserves.

===Australia===
Although formerly six British colonies, Australians only have limited access to the land, according to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. However, much of Australia&#x27;s land area is Crown land, which is administered by the Australian states, and while a lot of this consists of pastoral leases, and land owned and run by Aboriginal people (e.g. APY lands), access is normally permitted for recreational purposes to “unallocated” Crown land; though motorized vehicles are required to follow roads.

===New Zealand===
There is extensive public access in New Zealand, including waterways and the coast, but it is &quot;often fragmented and difficult to locate&quot;.

The &quot;Queen&#x27;s Chain&quot; is a concept in New Zealand property law. It is a strip of public land, usually 20 metres (or one chain in pre-metric measure) wide along rivers, lakes and the coast line. It was designed to prevent land upriver or along a coast being inaccessible to any prospective buyers. The strips are incomplete and their exact modern location can be complex to determine. These strips exist in various forms (including road reserves, esplanade reserves, esplanade strips, marginal strips and reserves of various types) but not as extensively and consistently as is often assumed.

In 2007, the government of New Zealand reviewed the rights of public access for outdoor recreation. However, unlike the United Kingdom, &quot;the New Zealand review recommended no increase in the public&#x27;s right to access private property&quot;.

<doc id="430386" wikidata="Q2620460" url="?curid=430386" title="Abu'l-Fadl Bayhaqi">
<text>Abūʾl-Fazl Muḥammad ibn Ḥusayn Bayhaqī (; died September 21, 1077), better known as Abu&#x27;l-Fazl Bayhaqi (; also spelled Beyhaqi), was a secretary, historian and author.

Educated in the major cultural center of Nishapur, and employed at the court of the famous Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud, Bayhaqi was a highly cultured man, whose &quot;magnum opus&quot;—the &quot;Tarikh-i Bayhaqi&quot;, is seen as the most reliable source of valid information about the Ghaznavid era, which was written in an exquisite and vivid Persian prose that would become an ideal model for several eras.

Bayhaqi is praised by modern scholars for his frankness, precision, and elegant style in his book, which he had spent 22 years to write, finishing it in thirty volumes, of which however only five volumes and half of the sixth exist today. Julie Scott Meisami places Bayhaqi among the historians of the Islamic Golden Age.

== Life ==
===Youth and early career===
Bayhaqi was born in the village of Harethabad in Bayhaq in the Khorasan Province to a Persian family. In his youth Bayhaqi studied in the major cultural center of Nishapur, and later in 1020/1 joined the secretariat (&quot;dīvān-e resālat&quot;) of Mahmud, where he worked as an assistant and pupil under the chief secretary Abu Nasr Mushkan for 19 years.

After Mushkan&#x27;s death in 1039/40, Mas&#x27;ud I (r. 1030–1040) appointed Bayhaqi as minister to Abu Sahl Zawzani, who had succeeded Muskhan as the chief secretary of the empire. Muskhan substantially urged the Sultan that Bayhaqi should be his successor, and the Persian &quot;vizier&quot; Ahmad Shirazi had also commended Bayhaqi in the Sultan&#x27;s attendance. Bayhaqi (who was at that time 46 years old) was supposedly told by Mas&#x27;ud I that he was too young to be appointed the new chief secretary.

===Later career===
Zawzani was not as accomplished in the management of the secretariat as his predecessor had been, and his methods were completely dissimilar. Furthermore, Bayhaqi was often a victim of his bad temper, which made the latter send a secret letter of relinquishment of his responsibility to the Sultan, who, however, heartened Bayhaqi to continue serving in his post, whilst ordering his &quot;vizier&quot; to inform that Zawzani should behave properly towards Bayhaqi at the secretariat. This he did, however; Mas&#x27;ud I died shortly afterwards being deserted by his army after a disastrous defeat against the Seljuq Turks, who then conquered Khorasan. Mas&#x27;ud&#x27;s death made Zawzani resume his bad treatment of Bayhaqi once more. Bayhaqi experienced several problems after Mas&#x27;ud I&#x27;s death, probably partly due to his own failings, which he himself often recognizes.

During the reign of Abd al-Rashid (r. 1049-1052) Bayhaqi was finally selected as the chief secretary. He was, however, after a short period removed from the post. According to Ibn Funduq, he was jailed by the judge (&quot;qāżī&quot;) of Ghazni on the complaint of having failed to meet the unpaid obligatory fee to a wife, but according to Aufi, the reason behind his imprisonment was due to the ploys of his enemies. A slave named Tuman (or Nuyan) was afterwards ordered by the Sultan to seize Bayhaqi&#x27;s possessions.

In 1052, the rebellious slave-soldier (&quot;ghulam&quot;) Toghrul seized Ghazni, had Abd al-Rashid killed, and had the sultan&#x27;s men jailed in a stronghold, where Bayhaqi was also moved. However, Toghrul&#x27;s reign lasted only 15 days; he was defeated and killed by Ghaznavid loyalists, who put Farrukh-zad (r. 1053–1059) on the throne. Bayhaqi was then released from imprisonment.

===The writing of &quot;Tarikh-i Bayhaqi&quot; and death===

According to Ibn Funduq, Bayhaqi served as secretary under Farrukh-zad and at the end of the latter&#x27;s reign withdrew from bureaucratic life and settled in Ghazni, where he started to write the &quot;Tarikh-i Bayhaqi&quot;. However, judging from Bayhaqi&#x27;s few comments in his book on Farrukh-zad&#x27;s rule, it appears that he did not take part in Farrukh-zad&#x27;s court. Indeed, he evidently reports that during those years he was occupied on writing his history.

According to the &quot;Aḵbār al-dawla al-saljūqīya&quot; (Chronicles of the Seljuq state), Bayhaqi formulated the peace treaty between the Seljuqs and Ghaznavids in 1058. He accordingly may have been called back to work after his dishonor and imprisonment during the rule of Abd al-Rashid. Anyhow the information of the &quot;Tarikh-i Bayhaqi&quot; evidently show that Bayhaqi in his old age, until his death in 1077, had committed himself completely to the writing of the book. His tomb is located in his birthplace, Harethabad.

<text>The U.S. state of Indiana has 24 state parks maintained and operated by Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR). In addition, a separate state agency operates White River State Park in downtown Indianapolis. Marion and Clark are the only counties to have two parks. Brown County, the largest state park, has the greatest number of visitors, followed by Indiana Dunes State Park.

Richard Lieber was instrumental in the foundation of the Indiana State Park system. The first state park in Indiana was McCormick&#x27;s Creek State Park, in Owen County in 1916, followed in the same year by Turkey Run State Park in Parke County. The number of state parks rose steadily in the 1920s, mostly by donations of land from local authorities to the state government. Of the initial twelve parks, only Muscatatuck State Park is no longer a state park, having been given back to Jennings County in 1968. It was during the Great Depression of the 1930s that much infrastructure was built within the parks, constructed by New Deal agencies such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration, with the majority of this Depression-era construction still in use in the 21st century. This delay in infrastructure was due in part to Richard Lieber&#x27;s belief that the parks should be kept as natural as possible.

Initially, the state parks were intended to feature natural environments in Indiana. The establishment of Mounds State Park for its historical nature and Shakamak State Park (an abandoned strip mine) purely for recreational purposes represented changes from the initial purposes of the Indiana state park system.

While Indiana does not have as many state parks as some other states, it has avoided obtaining too many smaller properties that would be hard to manage. A goal of having at least one state park within an hour&#x27;s drive for every Hoosier was met when Prophetstown State Park was established in 2004.

It is possible to view the Milky Way at 3 of the 24 Indiana State Parks, which are Shades State Park, Tippecanoe River State Park, and Turkey Run State Park.

<doc id="430390" wikidata="Q862232" url="?curid=430390" title="List of heads of state of Mali">
<text>This is a list of heads of state of Mali since the country gained independence from France in 1960 to the present day.

A total of seven people have served as head of state of Mali (excluding three acting presidents). Additionally, two people, Amadou Toumani Touré and Assimi Goïta, have served on two non-consecutive occasions.

The current head of state of Mali is interim president Assimi Goïta, who took power for a second time on 24 May 2021, after dismissing previous interim president Bah Ndaw in the 2021 coup d&#x27;état. He has since been constitutionally declared interim president of Mali. Since the 2023 constitutional referendum held during Goita&#x27;s leadership, Mali has shifted from a semi-presidential to a full presidential system, with the president serving as the head of government and dictating the policies of the government.

==Term limits==
As of 2021, there is a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of Mali. The term limit has not been met by any president yet. 

==Succession==
Article 53 of the Constitution entrusts the Prime Minister with the duties of the presidency during temporary absences. In the case of a definitive vacancy due to resignation, death, or permanent incapacitation, the President of the National Assembly assumes the functions of the president for a period of 90 to 120 days until a new president can be elected.

<doc id="430391" wikidata="Q214800" url="?curid=430391" title="Calvin Klein">
<text>Calvin Richard Klein (born November 19, 1942) is an American fashion designer who launched the company that later became Calvin Klein Inc., in 1968. In addition to clothing, he also has given his name to a range of perfumes, watches, and jewellery.

== Early life and career ==
Klein was born on November 19, 1942, to an Austro-Hungarian Jewish family in the Bronx, New York City, the son of Flore (&quot;née&quot; Stern; 1909–2006) and Leo Klein. Leo was born in Boiany then in Austria-Hungary now in Ukraine and had immigrated to New York, while Flore was born in the United States to immigrants from Galicia and Bukovina, Austria-Hungary (modern day-Ukraine).

Klein went to Isobel Rooney Middle School 80 (M.S.80) as a child. He attended the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan and attended New York&#x27;s Fashion Institute of Technology, leaving for six months after his first year before returning to finish his degree. He received an honorary doctorate from FIT in 2003. He did his apprenticeship in 1962 at an old line cloak-and-suit manufacturer, Dan Millstein, and spent five years designing at other New York City shops. In 1968, he launched his first company with his childhood best friend, Barry K. Schwartz.

He became a of Baron de Gunzburg, who introduced him to the New York elite fashion scene before he had his first mainstream success with the launch of his first jeans line. He was immediately recognized for his talent after his first major showing at New York Fashion Week. He was hailed as the new Yves Saint Laurent, and was noted for his clean lines.

In 1974, Klein designed the tight-fitting signature jeans that went on to gross $200,000 in their first week of sales.

In 1998, Klein participated in a celebrity reading of &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes,&quot; for The Starbright Foundation to benefit ill children.

== Personal life ==
Klein is a supporter of the U.S. Democratic Party, having given over $250,000 to candidates and PACs since 1980.

=== Relationships ===
Klein married Jayne Centre, a textile designer, in 1964. They have a daughter, television producer Marci Klein, who is best known for her work on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;30 Rock&quot;. The couple divorced in 1974. In September 1986, Klein married his assistant Kelly Rector in Rome while they were on a buying trip in Italy. She later became a well-known socialite photographer. After separating in 1996, they divorced in April 2006.

In the early 2010s, Klein dated gay ex-porn star Nicholas Gruber, who is 47 years younger than him.

=== Homes ===
For many years, Klein owned a home in Fire Island Pines, New York on Fire Island. He hosted friends such as artist Andy Warhol, Studio 54 owner Steve Rubell, Fashion designer Chester Weinberg, and media mogul David Geffen. Although he sold the property in 1995, it is still known as &quot;The Calvin Klein House.&quot;

In 2003, Klein bought an ocean-front estate in Southampton, New York, on Long Island and demolished it to build a $75 million glass-and-concrete mansion. In 2015, he put his Miami Beach, Florida mansion on the market for $16 million. The Florida home sold for $12,850,000 in February 2017. In June 2015, Klein bought a mansion in Los Angeles, California, for $25 million.

== Awards ==
In 1974, Klein also became the first designer to receive outstanding design in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s wear from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award show. In 1983, he was placed on the International Best Dressed List. Also in 1981, 1983, and 1993, he received an award from the CFDA. In 1991, he received the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award.

== In pop culture ==
Klein made a cameo appearance in season 3, episode 15 (&quot;The Bubble&quot;) of the television series &quot;30 Rock&quot;. A fictionalized version of him also appears in season 4, episode 12 (&quot;The Pick&quot;) of the television series &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.
The name Calvin Klein was used by Marty McFly in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, after a woman sees his underwear.

<doc id="430392" wikidata="Q715792" url="?curid=430392" title="Thomas Fitzalan, 5th Earl of Arundel">
<text>Thomas Fitzalan, 5th Earl of Arundel, 10th Earl of Surrey (13 October 138113 October 1415) was an English nobleman, one of the principals of the deposition of Richard II, and a major figure during the reign of Henry IV.

==Lineage==
He was the only surviving son of 4th earl of the second creation and his first wife, Elizabeth de Bohun. When he was 16 his father was executed (1397) and his lands and titles forfeited. Fitzalan was a royal ward of King Richard&#x27;s half-brother John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter, along with a large part of the Arundel estates. Holland greatly mistreated him, a matter Fitzalan would cruelly repay many years later.

==Escape, exile, return and restoration==
Eventually, Fitzalan escaped from his guardian and joined his uncle Thomas Arundel, the deposed Archbishop of Canterbury, in exile. The two eventually joined with another exile, the King&#x27;s cousin Henry Bolingbroke.

Fitzalan followed Henry in his return to England in July 1399, and in the following events which led to the deposition of King Richard II and Henry&#x27;s crowning as King Henry IV. He functioned as butler at the coronation, and shortly afterwards the new King restored him to his titles and estates. These included two notable Earldoms; those of Earl of Arundel and Earl of Surrey, and large estates in the Welsh Marches.

==The Epiphany Rising==
Early the next year a group of Barons who had been close to the deposed King Richard II revolted—known as the Epiphany Rising—amongst them Fitzalan&#x27;s former guardian John Holland. The latter was captured by followers of Fitzalan&#x27;s aunt Joan, Countess of Hereford, and at Fitzalan&#x27;s behest was soon executed (some claim he was tortured first).

==The rebellion of Owain Glyndwr in Wales==
The next few years Fitzalan was much occupied by events in the Welsh marches, where he had to help deal with the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr which ran in full from 1400 to maybe 1412 but gained a great deal of early momentum until 1405. After the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, he was appointed to defend the Marches from further attacks along its full length and then focused on defeating Glyndwr in the northern March adjacent to North Wales.

==Revolt in the North==
In 1405 there was a revolt in the north of England, led by Richard le Scrope, Archbishop of York; and Thomas de Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk. Fitzalan was the head of the Commission which condemned the pair to death. This apparently led to a falling out between Fitzalan and his uncle, Archbishop Thomas Arundel, who objected to the execution of a fellow prelate.

==Portuguese alliance and marriages==
King Henry&#x27;s sister, Philippa of Lancaster, had married King John I of Portugal, and to further cement the alliance between England and Portugal, Fitzalan married Beatrice, the illegitimate daughter of King John. The wedding took place in London on 26 November 1405, with King Henry IV in attendance.

==Welsh conflicts and alliance with Burgundy==
In the following years Fitzalan again had to help suppress revolts in Wales and the Welsh Marches. Politically, Fitzalan allied himself with the King&#x27;s half-brothers the Beauforts, and when Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, was appointed Chancellor in 1410, Fitzalan became one of the King&#x27;s principal councillors. Beaufort favoured an alliance with Burgundy, and Fitzalan was one of the leaders of those sent to help fight the rival Armagnac faction in France. Sometime in this period, Fitzalan was made a Knight of the Garter.

Henry IV fell seriously ill in 1411, but was determined to forge an alliance with John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. The King announced his intention that a fleet would be sailing to Calais, and issued instructions to ambassadors to go to Burgundy&#x27;s offer of a military aid against Orleans. But two days before the fleet was due to sail, the king changed his mind, and on 21 September 1411 declared Parliament would meet in November. Instead, Arundel set sail with a private fleet and a mercenary force hired by the Burgundians from the Prince of Wales. Arundel found himself in a difficult dilemma: the king wanted an Armagnac alliance, but the prince preferred to deal with Burgundy. A double-dealing policy commenced negotiating with the duke of Berry while continuing to reinforce Burgundy. But the old king recovered at the November Parliament, and the prince&#x27;s Regency council was dismissed. On 9 November, Arundel led 1000 archers to aid the Burgundians to victory before the bridge at the Battle of St Cloud, near Paris. Some of Arundel&#x27;s men fought in the ranks of Duke&#x27;s bodyguard.

The Peace of Chartres signed by Henry IV in 1409 was broken. His policy of pro-Valois Armagnac diplomacy was enshrined in the Treaty of Bourges. But no sooner had it been signed on 20 May, the friends of the Burgundian elites declared it illegal, because it was. John the Fearless raised a royal army forcing Berry to surrender Bourges in the name of Charles VI on 15 July. The very next day the peace was renewed by the French nobility in a promissory letter to Henry IV signed by the dukes of Berry, Orleans, Bourbon and Burgundy. 

On 10 August 1412, the peace was again threatened by Thomas, Duke of Clarence who extorted a humiliating ransom from the Armagnacs after he had landed at St Vaast-le-Hogue. The King favoured Clarence over his older brother, so the Beauforts lost influence, and Arundel retired to his estates. Clarence was instructed to proceed to Gascony to await; the next spring King Henry IV died.

==Great friend and soldier of Henry V==
Arundel was with Henry at Westminster for Christmas 1414. One of the king&#x27;s close friends he displayed the cardinal virtues of loyalty to the Lancastrian monarchy, as well as enjoying the honour of personal comradeship. Some lords remained loyal to Richard II and threatened rebellion throughout the North. There were those on the Welsh Marches, such as the Chamberlain of Chester who had deserted to Owain Glendower.}

The new King Henry V restored the Earl of Arundel to a place of influence, immediately appointing him Lord Treasurer, as well as constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports. On 19 March 1415, The Lord Warden was ordered to summon and array seamen for forthcoming fleet operations: 57 ships from the Cinque Ports in 40 days were expected to assemble. No ship of more than 20 tuns was permitted to leave port. All requisitioned vessels were to be taken to Southampton by 8 May. On St George&#x27;s Day at Windsor Arundel was made a Knight of the Garter with precedence. He was among 16 of the 25 knights preparing for war that summer. The following day 24 April, the king rewarded his friend with an additional £300 on top of a modest salary as Lord Treasurer of £100 per annum. Arundel&#x27;s experience deploying massed ranks of longbowmen was vital to Henry&#x27;s strategy to succeed; as many as 2000 had been used at St Cloud.

But the invasion date was put back to 1 July, at the end of April. On 15 June a service was held at St Paul&#x27;s; Arundel could not have known he would not return in triumph, so he lingered at least until 24 June. Meanwhile, he was despatched on an expedition &quot;into parts of Wales&quot; to raise more archers to add complement to existing units. The royal household paid him £18 12s expenses, but the coffers being bare, Arundel&#x27;s troops did not receive all their wages.

On 27 May 1415, Arundel and Thomas Beaufort had been put in charge of provisioning Calais and the army in Normandy. This included a scheme devised by the Keeper of the Privy Seal to extort money out of Italian merchants in London that raised nearly £2000. As they were about to leave (8 August) Southampton by ship, King Henry replaced Arundel with a new Treasurer, Sir John Rothenhale; Arundel was on the campaign to fight. He wrote a will signing over his estates to trustees for his wife, Beatrice, Countess Arundel and the children for which he gained the King&#x27;s consent.

&quot;Noblesse oblige&quot; was one of Arundel&#x27;s personal chivalric codes. When it was revealed the earl of March was inveigled into the Southampton Plot, Arundel and Lord Scrope provided the bulk of the 10,000 marks fine imposed by Henry for this illegal marriage to Anne Stafford. Arundel&#x27;s astute business dealings saved March and the King at the Michaelmas Council, which was in uproar. Bishop Richard Countenay of Norwich had died, the Duke of Clarence was ill, but Arundel remained the King&#x27;s &quot;great friend&quot;. The Southampton plotters attempted to implicate Arundel, but as their testimony unravelled it became clear Sir Thomas Gray was speaking spiteful lies, and the young earl was held to be without blame.

Arundel was one of the initial commanders of Henry V&#x27;s 1415 French campaign, he sailed with a minimum one hundred men-at-arms, and three hundred archers. Of his own retinue two men-at-arms and thirteen archers died at the siege of Harfleur. At least fourteen men-at-arms and sixty-eight archers were sick, and sent home on the Feast of St Wenceslas (29 Sept); Arundel was among them with five men-at-arms to help him. The Council advised the king against a proposed march to Calais, but Arundel had to return to Sussex on 10 October 1415. He was nursed by a faithful retainer&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Ryman. In his will made on 10 October, he asked to be buried in the church of the Holy Trinity, Arundel. He left 200 marks for a funeral, and required a statue be erected over his father&#x27;s grave. He had pledged a vow to pray to St John of Bridlington when he was a servant of Prince Hal; and now at Mary Gate, Arundel, a chapel was to be built dedicated to the Virgin. Arundel wanted all the wages arrears to be paid by his heirs that were owed to the soldiery.

==Ancestry==

==Succession==
Fitzalan left no legitimate children. The castle and lordship of Arundel was inherited by his cousin John Fitzalan, 6th Earl of Arundel. The Earldom of Surrey fell into abeyance (or became extinct; authorities differ on this matter). The rest of his property was split amongst his three surviving sisters.

<doc id="430394" wikidata="Q1139458" url="?curid=430394" title="After Life (film)">
<text>After Life, known in Japan as , is a 1998 Japanese film edited, written and directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda starring Arata, Erika Oda and Susumu Terajima. It premiered on 11 September 1998 at the 1998 Toronto International Film Festival and distributed in over 30 countries, bringing international recognition to Kore-eda&#x27;s work.

The film was also shown at the 1998 San Sebastián International Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI prize &quot;for its universal theme, its empathy for nostalgia and its homage to cinema as transcending life&quot;. The film received seven awards and eight nominations worldwide.

In August 2021, The Criterion Collection announced a re-release of the film, in a 2K remaster together with interviews, deleted scenes, audio commentary and an essay by novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen.

==Plot==
A small, mid-20th century social-service-style structure is a way station between life and death. Every Monday, a group of recently deceased people check-in: the social workers in the lodge ask them to go back over their life and choose one single memory to take into the afterlife. They are given just a couple of days to identify their happiest memory, after which the workers design, stage and film them. In this way, the souls will be able to re-experience this moment for eternity, forgetting the rest of their life. They will spend eternity within their happiest memory.

Twenty-two souls of different ages and backgrounds arrive and are received by the counsellors, who explain to them their situation. Lengthy interviews take place in the lodge, with each person having different perspectives of their lives. There is a gentle old woman whose fondest memory is cherry blossoms. There is an aviator whose happiest moments were spent flying through the clouds. There is also a teenager whose happiest memory is Splash Mountain at Disneyland. Told that she&#x27;s the thirtieth to choose Disneyland rides (most of the others were also teenage girls), she is gently coaxed into coming up with something more original from her childhood (the scent of fresh laundry and the feeling of her mother, whom she was cuddling against). A 78-year-old woman talks about a new dress her brother bought her for a childhood dance recital, a brother she loved and took care of &quot;until the very end.&quot; A prostitute remembers a client who was kind; a potential suicide victim recalls what made him pull back from the brink; an old man remembers the breeze on his face when he rode a trolley to school. An older man incessantly talks about sex and prostitutes, but ultimately chooses the memory of his daughter handing him the bouquet at her wedding. A wild-haired 21-year-old wearing leather pants refuses point-blank to choose anything at all.

The story focuses on the two younger counsellors, Takashi and Shiori. Takashi has been assigned to help Ichiro Watanabe, a 70-year-old man who glumly remembers his dull, conventional life in an arranged marriage as unfulfilling. To jog his memory, Takashi plays back excerpts from a file of year-by-year videotapes recording Watanabe&#x27;s life. Takashi learns from the films that Watanabe&#x27;s wife, Kyoko, was also Takashi&#x27;s fiancée, and that the two men are about the same age. Takashi died in his early twenties in the Philippines in World War II and had been working at different processing centers since then. Takashi requests Watanabe to be assigned to another counsellor, but his request is not granted.

Near the end of the week, Watanabe decides which memory to keep. Watanabe apologizes to Takashi for causing Takashi trouble and picking a memory so late. Takashi asks him not to apologize and reveals to Watanabe that all the counsellors staying in the lodge are souls who refused or were unable to choose a memory.

The social workers recreate the memories by filming on sets with basic stage props (cotton balls serve as clouds for the pilot; an audio recording of street noise is played while the old man stands in a trolley and social workers jostle the trolley to replicate movement). On Saturday, all the hosted souls except the wild-haired young man watch the films of their recreated memories in a screening room, and as soon as each person sees their own, they vanish.

Takashi, while putting away the videotapes from Watanabe&#x27;s room, finds a letter from Watanabe saying Watanabe realized that his wife was Takashi&#x27;s fiancée, and his wife had visited Takashi&#x27;s grave every year, alone, during her and Watanabe&#x27;s marriage. Watanabe writes in his letter that he appreciates Takashi&#x27;s kindness in not mentioning that he was his wife&#x27;s dead fiancée, and that it was only through his experience with Takashi and watching the videotapes that he was able to come to peace with his life and choose a memory with his wife.

Takashi talks to Shiori about his life, and Shiori finds his fiancée&#x27;s selected memory from the archive. In watching his fiancée&#x27;s selected memory, Takashi realizes she chose a memory with him, before his death. In discovering that he had figured in his fiancé&#x27;s chosen moment to cherish, Takashi comes to the realization that &quot;I have learnt I was part of someone else&#x27;s happiness.&quot; He chooses that moment of realization as his sliver of life to be filmed and abandons the way station forever, spending eternity in this memory.

The next day, the remaining staff prepare for a new group of arrivals, and address the difficulties they will face in integrating the recalcitrant young man into the staff. The film ends with Shiori, now a full-fledged counsellor, practicing for an interview.

==Cast==
==Themes and techniques==
Kore-eda conceived the film from a childhood experience he had with his grandfather, who suffered from a neurodegenerative disease in a time when this kind of syndrome was yet not well known. Remembering his gradual loss of memory, which led him not to recognize the faces of his relatives and eventually his own, he commented that &quot;I comprehended little of what I saw, but I remember thinking that people forgot everything when they died. I now understand how critical memories are to our identity, to a sense of self&quot;.

In the development phase of the script, the director interviewed more than five hundred people from disparate social backgrounds, asking them to tell him about their memories and choose the single one they would keep. Kore-eda was &quot;intrigued by how often people chose upsetting experiences&quot;. The film alternates real footage of these interviews with acting, some based on improvisation, some on a specific script; the interviews were shot on 16 mm film stock by Yutaka Yamazaki, a recognized documentary cinematographer. With this method, Kore-eda combined documentary with a fictional narrative.

In the film, memories themselves are altered by people when they recall them and are subjectively revised, enhanced and reinterpreted when they are staged and recreated. About this ambiguous, fleeting nature of memory, Kore-eda reflects:

For the memory sequences, shot both in colour and black and white on a mixture of 8 mm and 16 mm film, Kore-eda involved the still photographer Masayoshi Sukita (best known at the time for his work on the set of &quot;Mystery Train&quot;).

==Reception==
&quot;After Life&quot; received positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;After Life&quot; is an offbeat and tender exploration of memory, love, and life after death&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 91 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

On &quot;AllMovie&quot;, Keith Phipps talks about the film as &quot;a peculiar and uniquely moving examination of life after death&quot;, observing how &quot;almost incidentally [it] serves as a meditation on filmmaking&quot;. &quot;Its unhurried pace and lack of melodrama, like its subject, may linger in the memory long afterwards&quot;, adds Jonathan Crow in the same review.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, calling it &quot;a film that reaches out gently to the audience&quot;, comparing it favorably to James Joyce&#x27;s story &quot;The Dead&quot;. He concluded that Kore-eda, with this and his previous film &quot;Maborosi&quot;, &quot;has earned the right to be considered with Kurosawa, Bergman and other great humanists of the cinema&quot;.

== Stage adaptation ==

A stage play based on the film opened in the Dorfman Theatre at the National Theatre, London from 2 June 2021. The play is written by Jack Thorne, designed by Bunny Christie and directed by Jeremy Herrin, in a co-production with Headlong.

<doc id="430398" wikidata="Q1436130" url="?curid=430398" title="Still">
<text>A still is an apparatus used to distill liquid mixtures by heating to selectively boil and then cooling to condense the vapor. A still uses the same concepts as a basic distillation apparatus, but on a much larger scale. Stills have been used to produce perfume and medicine, water for injection (WFI) for pharmaceutical use, generally to separate and purify different chemicals, and to produce distilled beverages containing ethanol.

==Application==

Since ethanol boils at a much lower temperature than water, simple distillation can separate ethanol from water by applying heat to the mixture. Historically, a copper vessel was used for this purpose, since copper removes undesirable sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol. However, many modern stills are made of stainless steel pipes with copper linings to prevent erosion of the entire vessel and lower copper levels in the waste product (which in large distilleries is processed to become animal feed). Copper is the preferred material for stills because it yields an overall better-tasting spirit. The taste is improved by the chemical reaction between the copper in the still and the sulfur compounds created by the yeast during fermentation. These unwanted and flavor-changing sulfur compounds are chemically removed from the final product resulting in a smoother, better-tasting drink. All copper stills will require repairs about every eight years due to the precipitation of copper-sulfur compounds. The beverage industry was the first to implement a modern distillation apparatus and led the way in developing equipment standards which are now widely accepted in the chemical industry.


There is also an increasing usage of the distillation of gin under glass and PTFE, and even at reduced pressures, to facilitate a fresher product. This is irrelevant to alcohol quality because the process starts with triple distilled grain alcohol, and the distillation is used solely to harvest botanical flavors such as limonene and other terpene like compounds. The ethyl alcohol is relatively unchanged.

The simplest standard distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still, consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol. A pot still incorporates only one condensation, whereas other types of distillation equipment have multiple stages which result in higher purification of the more volatile component (alcohol). Pot still distillation gives an incomplete separation, but this can be desirable for the flavor of some distilled beverages.

If a purer distillate is desired, a reflux still is the most common solution. Reflux stills incorporate a fractionating column, commonly created by filling copper vessels with glass beads to maximize available surface area. As alcohol boils, condenses, and reboils through the column, the effective number of distillations greatly increases. Vodka and gin and other neutral grain spirits are distilled by this method, then diluted to concentrations appropriate for human consumption.

Alcoholic products from home distilleries are common throughout the world but are sometimes in violation of local statutes. The product of illegal stills in the United States is commonly referred to as moonshine and in Ireland, poitín. However, poitín, although made illegal in 1661, has been legal for export in Ireland since 1997. Note that the term moonshine itself is often misused as many believe it to be a specific kind of high-proof alcohol that was distilled from corn, but the term can refer to any illicitly distilled alcohol.

<text>HMAS &quot;Queenborough&quot; (G70/D270/F02/57) (originally HMS &quot;Queenborough&quot; (G70/D19)) was a Q-class destroyer that served in the Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

Constructed during World War II as part of the War Emergency Programme, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was laid down in 1940 and launched in 1942, serving in the Arctic, Mediterranean, and Pacific theatres. After the war ended, the ship was transferred on loan to the RAN in exchange for an N-class destroyer, then given to Australia as a gift in 1950.

&quot;Queenborough&quot; was converted to an anti-submarine frigate, and served with the RAN until 1966. During this time, she was deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve on multiple occasions, participated in numerous fleet exercises, and took on a partial training role. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve, but reactivated in 1969 as a training ship. &quot;Queenborough&quot; remained in service for another three years, until a series of mechanical and structural faults required that she be retired, decommissioning in 1972 and being scrapped in Hong Kong in 1975.

==Design and construction==

The sixth RN ship to be named after the town of Queenborough in Kent, England, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was laid down by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson at Wallsend-on-Tyne on 6 November 1940. She was launched on 16 January 1942, commissioned into the RN on 15 September, and completed on 10 December. She cost £725,000 to complete.
The main armament for &quot;Queenborough&quot; consisted of four single 4.7-inch QF Mark IX guns, two before and two aft of the main superstructure. Secondary weapons included a quadruple-mounting QF 2-pounder Mark VIII pom-pom located just aft of the funnel, and six single Oerlikon 20 mm cannons provided anti-air capability, while eight Mark VIII torpedo tubes (4 forward, 4 aft) firing  Mark IX torpedoes for anti-ship engagements.

==RN service==
HMS &quot;Queenborough&quot; served in the Arctic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean during World War II. She was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, which was made up of Q-class destroyers.

===Arctic convoys===
Following commissioning, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was assigned to the British Home Fleet and spent the end of 1942 and the early part of 1943 as an Arctic convoy escort.

On 31 December 1942, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was one of ten ships taken by Home Fleet commander Admiral Tovey to reinforce the ships covering Arctic convoy JW 51B, following the Battle of the Barents Sea.

She was briefly deployed to the waters off South Africa before the 4th Destroyer Flotilla was assigned to Force H and the Mediterranean theatre in mid-1943.

===Italian landings===

&quot;Queenborough&quot; was involved in numerous Allied landings of the Italian Campaign. She was part of the British covering force for the Allied invasion of Sicily on 10 July. The destroyer was involved in the leadup to the British landings at Calabria from 31 August to 3 September, including preparatory shelling of the landing site on 31 August and 2 September. A week later, she supported the United States troop landings at Salerno, remaining on station until 16 September.

===British Eastern Fleet===
The 4th Destroyer Flotilla was ordered to depart the Mediterranean theatre and sail for the Indian Ocean in March 1944, to join the British Eastern Fleet.

Near the end of March, &quot;Queenborough&quot; commenced involvement in Operation Diplomat. Leaving Trincomalee, on 21 March, the 18-ship fleet practiced refuelling south of Ceylon. On 27 March, the fleet met United States reinforcements— and three escorts—with the combined force arriving back in Trincomalee on 31 March.

From 16 to 24 April, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was assigned to Task Force 70 of Operation Cockpit as one of the ships escorting aircraft carriers and USS &quot;Saratoga&quot;. On her return to Trincomalee, the destroyer joined Task Force 66 for Operation Transom, a carrier-based air raid on Surabaya. The task force replenished from tankers at Exmouth Bay on 15 May, before attacking on 17 May. &quot;Queenborough&quot; returned to Trincomalee on 27 May.

&quot;Queenborough&quot; departed Trincomalee on 15 October as part of Task Force 63, a British Eastern Fleet operation to focus Japanese attention on the west coast of Malaya as a diversion for American amphibious landings in the Philippines. The diversionary attacks, known as Operation Millet, included a series of bombardments and air raids against Japanese installations and ships in Malacca and Car Nicobar, and were intended to appear as if the Allies were preparing an invasion of Malaya. &quot;Queenborough&quot; was attached to Group 1, consisting of the battleship and her escorts, and bombarded Car Nicobar on 17 and 18 October. Despite heavy damage to the target areas, Operation Millet failed to attract a significant reaction from the Japanese, as available resources were already en route to defend Leyte from invasion.

===British Pacific Fleet===
At the end of 1944, the heavily reinforced British Eastern Fleet was split into two forces, The smaller East Indies Fleet remained in the Indian Ocean, while the larger British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was redeployed to the Pacific Ocean, to increase the British and Commonwealth presence in the war against Japan. &quot;Queenborough&quot; and the 4th Destroyer Flotilla were assigned to the latter at the end of November 1944. As part of this deployment, ship numbers and designations were changed from the British pennant system to the American hull number system to facilitate operation with the United States Navy; &quot;Queenborough&quot;″s pennant was changed from G70 to D19.

From 23 March to 29 May 1945, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was part of the escort screen protecting British carriers as their aircraft attacked Japanese airfields in the Ryukyu Islands.

The destroyer received five battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Arctic 1942–43&quot;, &quot;Sicily 1943&quot;, &quot;Salerno 1943&quot;, &quot;Mediterranean 1943&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.

==Transfer to RAN==
Following the conclusion of World War II, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was one of three RN Q-class destroyers transferred to the RAN on loan. Another two had been loaned to the RAN since commissioning. This arrangement allowed the four N-class destroyers loaned to the RAN during the war to be returned. &quot;Queenborough&quot; was the last ship to commission into the RAN, in September 1945, in trade for .

===Frigate conversion===
In early 1950, the decision was made to convert all five Q-class destroyers in RAN service to anti-submarine warfare frigates, similar to the Type 15 frigate conversions performed on several War Emergency Programme destroyers of the RN. A proposal was made by the Australian government to pay for the upgrade to the five on-loan vessels, at the predicted cost of AU£400,000 each. Instead, the British Admiralty presented the ships to the RAN on 1 June as gifts. The conversions were part of an overall plan to improve the anti-submarine warfare capability of the RAN, although &quot;Queenborough&quot; and the other ships were only a &#x27;stopgap&#x27; measure until purpose-built ASW frigates could be constructed. &quot;Queenborough&quot; was the second ship to be converted, and was rebuilt as a frigate at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney. The modernisation began in May 1950, and despite predictions that work would finish within 18 months, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was not recommissioned until 7 December 1954.

The conversion started with the removal of the ship&#x27;s entire armament. The entire superstructure was cut off, and replaced with a larger, aluminium construction. The quality of accommodation was improved. Fuel stowage was reduced, in turn cutting the ship&#x27;s range from at to at . The bridge was enclosed, and a dedicated operations room was installed, in order to coordinate the great quantity and type of data collected by the ship&#x27;s sensors. &quot;Queenborough&quot; was fitted with new guns: a twin 4 inch high angle/low angle gun aft of the superstructure, and a twin 40 mm Bofors gun forward of the bridge. The reduction in gun armament was justified by the inclusion of a Limbo anti-submarine mortar.

The conversion resulted in a 315-ton increase in standard displacement. The ship&#x27;s draught increased from to .

The converted ships were formed as the 1st Australian Frigate Squadron.

==Post-conversion service==

===As frigate===
On 24 February 1955, &quot;Queenborough&quot; departed Sydney for England, to participate in anti-submarine warfare training with the Royal Navy. After repairs to damage sustained during the journey, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was assigned to the RN Training Squadron, attached to the Joint Anti-Submarine School in Derry, Northern Ireland. The ship was attached to the 6th Frigate Squadron during this period. In addition to the squadron&#x27;s badge depicting the Red Hand of Ulster, &quot;Queenborough&quot; added a red kangaroo design to her funnel to depict the ship&#x27;s Australian allegiance; one of the earliest instances of using a red kangaroo to identify an Australian warship.

&quot;Queenborough&quot; was first deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve in early 1956. After returning to Darwin on 10 April, the ship was made lead vessel of the 1st Frigate Squadron.

&quot;Queenborough&quot; and sister ship were sent to the Strategic Reserve at the end of January 1959. During the four-month assignment, the ships were assigned to the royal escort of for the visit of Prince Philip to Singapore, and participated in SEATO Exercise Sea Demon. The frigate returned to Sydney on 16 May 1959.

In October 1962 &quot;Queenborough&quot; together with rescued 25 survivors from the Panamanian merchant steamer &quot;Kawi&quot;, which sank after being caught in a storm in the South China Sea. In December 1962, again with HMAS &quot;Quiberon&quot;, &quot;Queenborough&quot; rescued the crew of SS &quot;Tuscany&quot;, which had run aground on a reef in the South China Sea.

On 8 May 1963 &quot;Queenborough&quot; collided with British submarine off Jervis Bay during anti-submarine training exercises. &quot;Tabard&quot;″s fin and conning tower were damaged, and minor damage was inflicted to the underside of &quot;Queenborough&quot;, but both vessels were able to return to Sydney unaided. In September, &quot;Queenborough&quot; and sister ship &quot;Quiberon&quot; were deployed to the FESR. On 26 October, the two ships were involved in the rescue of survivors from MV &quot;Kawi&quot;, The ships visited Calcutta in December, before returning to Hong Kong for Christmas.

In January 1963 &quot;Queenborough&quot; was replaced as the lead vessel of the 1st Frigate Squadron by . From 31 January to 4 February, &quot;Queenborough&quot; and &quot;Quiberon&quot; were in Saigon for a diplomatic visit; they were the last RAN ships to visit Vietnam before Australia&#x27;s military became involved in the Vietnam War. Following the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Australia in March and April 1963, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was stationed between Australia and New Caledonia as a precautionary air-sea rescue ship for the first leg of the Queen&#x27;s departure flight. &quot;Queenborough&quot; was decommissioned into reserve on 10 July 1963.

===As training ship===
After spending three years in reserve, a need for expanded training capabilities saw &quot;Queenborough&quot; recommissioned on 28 July 1966 as a dedicated anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training ship. While being prepared for her new duties, the 4-inch guns and gunnery radar were removed (although the turret would remain until early 1968). An improved Type 978 radar was installed.

In October 1966, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was deployed to Tasmania on a training cruise. An Australian researcher on Macquarie Island required a medical evacuation: as the closest Australian vessel, &quot;Queenborough&quot; changed course for the island. The ship encountered seas, winds, hail, and snow en route, and arrived in time to collect the scientist before worse weather set in.

At the start of 1969, the RAN&#x27;s ship designation and numbering system was changed from the British system to the US system. &quot;Queenborough&quot; was reclassified as a destroyer escort, and received the number 57 (without any prefix letter). The similarity of the new number to the &quot;57 Varieties&quot; advertising slogan of the H. J. Heinz Company, led to a relationship between the ship and the Australian branch of the company.

On 22 July 1969, &quot;Queenborough&quot; completed her 400,000th nautical mile of sailing since launching.

On 16 April 1970, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was part of a 45-ship, 13-nation fleet assembled in Sydney Harbour as part of the Australian Bicentenary celebrations.

In June 1971, &quot;Queenborough&quot; left Sydney to visit Fiji, Samoa, and New Zealand. Heavy weather between Fiji and New Zealand created cracks in the bow. These were detected in New Zealand waters, with &quot;Queenborough&quot; docking in Auckland until 5 July for repairs.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Queenborough&quot; was decommissioned on 7 April 1972. Tenders for purchase of the ship closed in February 1975, and on 8 April 1975 &quot;Queenborough&quot; was sold to Willtop (Asia) Ltd. The ship was towed to Hong Kong, arriving on 20 June, to be broken up for scrap.

Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, &quot;Queenborough&quot; was retroactively awarded the honour &quot;Malaya 1957&quot; for her service during the Malayn Emergency.

<text>A pinnacle is an architectural element originally forming the cap or crown of a buttress or small turret, but afterwards used on parapets at the corners of towers and in many other situations. The pinnacle looks like a small spire. It was mainly used in Gothic architecture.

The pinnacle had two purposes:
# Ornamental – adding to the loftiness and verticity of the structure. They sometimes ended with statues, such as in Milan Cathedral.
# Structural – the pinnacles were very heavy and often rectified with lead, in order to enable the flying buttresses to contain the stress of the structure vaults and roof. This was done by adding compressive stress (a result of the pinnacle weight) to the thrust vector and thus shifting it downwards rather than sideways.

== History ==

The accounts of Jesus&#x27; temptations in Matthew&#x27;s and Luke&#x27;s gospels both suggest that the Second Temple in Jerusalem had one or more pinnacles ():
:Then he (Satan) brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here.

Some have stated that there were no pinnacles in the Romanesque style, but conical caps to circular buttresses, with finial terminations, are not uncommon in France at very early periods. Eugène Viollet-le-Duc gives examples from Saint-Germer-de-Fly Abbey and the Basilica of Saint-Remi, and there is one of similar form at the west front of Rochester Cathedral.

In the 12th-century Romanesque two examples have been cited, one from Bredon in Worcestershire, and the other from Cleeve in Gloucestershire. In these the buttresses run up, forming a sort of square turret, and crowned with a pyramidal cap, very much like those of the next period, the Early English.
In this and the following styles, mainly in Gothic architecture, the pinnacle seems generally to have had its appropriate uses. It was a weight to counteract the thrust of the vaults, particularly where there were flying buttresses; it stopped the tendency to slip of the stone copings of the gables, and counterpoised the thrust of spires; it formed a pier to steady the elegant perforated parapets of later periods; and in France especially served to counterbalance the weight of overhanging corbel tables, huge gargoyles, etc.

In the Early English period the small buttresses frequently finished with gablets, and the more important with pinnacles supported with clustered shafts. At this period the pinnacles were often supported on these shafts alone, and were open below; and in larger work in this and the subsequent periods they frequently form niches and contain statues. About the Transition and during the Decorated Gothic period, the different faces above the angle shafts often finish with gablets. Those of the last-named period are much richer, and are generally decorated with crockets and finials, and sometimes with ball flowers. Very fine groups are found at Beverley Minster and at the rise of the spire of St Mary&#x27;s, Oxford. Perpendicular pinnacles differ but little from Decorated, except that the crockets and finials are of later character. They are also often set angle-ways, particularly on parapets, and the shafts are panelled.

In France pinnacles, like spires, seem to have been in use earlier than in England. There are small pinnacles at the angles of the tower in the Saintes Cathedral. At Roullet-Saint-Estèphe there are pinnacles in a similar position, each composed of four small shafts, with caps and bases surmounted with small pyramidal spires. In all these examples the towers have semicircular-headed windows.

<doc id="430403" wikidata="Q469423" url="?curid=430403" title="Chŏng Mong-ju">
<text>Chŏng Mong-ju (, January 13, 1337 – May 4, 1392), also known by his art name P&#x27;oŭn (), was a Korean statesman, diplomat, philosopher, poet, calligrapher and reformist of the Goryeo period. He was a major figure of opposition to the transition from the Goryeo (918–1392) to Joseon (1392–1897) periods.

Being the last great personality from the late Goryeo period, exceptional in all aspects of academics, diplomacy, economics, military and politics, and trying to reform Goryeo while maintaining the declining kingdom, he opposed to the Goryeo general Yi Sŏng-gye (the first king of the future Joseon Dynasty) who was a radical revolutionary against the rotten Goryeo Dynasty. Due to his loyalty to Goryeo, Chŏng Mong-ju was eventually assassinated by five men of Yi Pang-wŏn (the fifth son of Yi Sŏng-gye and the third king of Joseon Dynasty).

== Biography ==
Chŏng Mong-ju was born in Yeongcheon, Gyeongsang Province to a family from the Yeonil Jeong clan (). He was the eldest of five siblings.

At the age of 23, he took three different civil service literary examinations (gwageo) and received the highest marks possible on each of them. In 1367, he became an instructor of Neo-Confucianism at the Gukjagam, then called Songgyungwan, whilst simultaneously holding a government position, and was a faithful public servant to King U. The king had great confidence in his wide knowledge and good judgment, and so he participated in various national projects and his scholarly works earned him great respect in the Goryeo court.

In 1372, Chŏng Mong-ju was sent as a diplomatic envoy to the Ming Dynasty. Around this time, because the &quot;Waegu&quot; ( - the Japanese pirates) invasions of the Korean Peninsula were extreme, in 1377 Chŏng Mong-ju was dispatched as a delegate to Kyūshū in Japan. His negotiations led to promises of Japanese aid in defeating the pirates. At this time, the tandai of Kyūshū, Imagawa Sadayo, made several repressions against the Waegu, probably as a direct result of Chŏng Mong-ju&#x27;s diplomacy. There is a reason to believe that Sadayo and Chŏng negotiated directly, as later, Sadayo lost his position due to unlawful negotiations with Goryeo. Chŏng Mong-ju traveled to the Ming Dynasty&#x27;s capital city in 1384 and the negotiations with the Chinese led to peace with the Ming Dynasty in 1385. He also founded an institute devoted to the theories of Confucianism.
Chŏng Mong-ju had originally been a moderate supporter of Yi Sŏng-gye and supported his take-over of the court after the Wihwado Retreat from 1388. Although initially supporting some of Yi&#x27;s moderate reforms, Chŏng soon realized that Yi and some of his more radical supporters, such as Chŏng To-jŏn and Cho Chun, were planning to establish a new dynasty. Due to Chŏng Mong-ju&#x27;s strong Neo-Confucian beliefs, he was a staunch Goryeo loyalist and opposed any attempts to end the Goryeo Dynasty and found a new one, calling it an immoral act to do so.

On April 9, 1392, Yi Sŏng-gye was seriously injured in a horse-back riding accident. Chŏng planned to use this opportunity to destroy Yi&#x27;s faction. When Yi Pang-wŏn (later Taejong of Joseon), the fifth son of Yi Sŏng-gye, managed to bring back his father to the capital from site of the accident, Chŏng became unsure of the true extent of Yi Sŏng-gye&#x27;s injuries. On April 26, Chŏng went to Yi&#x27;s residence to assess the extent of his injuries. During a banquet held for Chŏng, he and Yi Pang-wŏn exchanged poems. Yi Pang-wŏn recited a poem (&quot;Hayeoga&quot;, 하여가 / 何如歌) to dissuade Chŏng Mong-ju from remaining loyal to the Goryeo Dynasty, but Chŏng Mong-ju answered with another poem (&quot;Dansimga&quot;, 단심가 / 丹心歌) that affirmed his strong loyalty. As a result, on his way home, Chŏng Mong-ju was assassinated on the Sonjuk Bridge in Gaeseong, by five of Yi Pang-wŏn&#x27;s subordinates. Yi Sŏng-gye is said to have lamented Chŏng Mong-ju&#x27;s death and rebuked his son, because Chŏng Mong-ju was a highly regarded politician by the common people. The bridge where Chŏng Mong-ju was murdered, nowadays in North Korea, has now become a national monument of the country. A brown spot on one of the stones is said to be Chŏng Mong-ju&#x27;s bloodstain and is said to become red whenever it rains. Currently, his direct surviving descendants are his 28th – 36th generation, who reside all over the world.

The 474-year-old Goryeo Dynasty symbolically ended with Chŏng Mong-ju&#x27;s death and was followed by the Joseon period for 505 years (1392–1897). Chŏng Mong-ju&#x27;s noble death symbolizes his faithful allegiance to the king and Goryeo, and later he was venerated even by Joseon monarchs. Chŏng Mong-ju&#x27;s murderer, Yi Pang-wŏn (later Taejong of Joseon), inscribed the words &quot;Defender of Goryeo&quot; on his tombstone to praise his loyalty. In 1517, 125 years after his death, he was canonized into Sungkyunkwan (the National Neo-Confucian Academy) alongside, in time, of other Korean sages such as Yi Hwang (Toegye, 1501–1570) and Yi I (Yulgok, 1536–1584). His grave is located in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, and he was buried next to his wife.

The 11th pattern of ITF Taekwondo is named after P&#x27;oŭn. The pattern is performed as part of the testing syllabus for the level of 2nd-degree black belt. The diagram ( — ) represents Chŏng Mong-ju&#x27;s unerring loyalty to his king and his country towards the end of the Goryeo Dynasty.

== The poems ==
=== Yi Pang-wŏn&#x27;s &quot;sijo&quot; (poem) - &quot;Hayeoga&quot; (하여가 / 何如歌) ===

이런들 어떠하리 저런들 어떠하리此亦何如彼亦何如。(차역하여피역하여)

만수산 드렁칡이 얽어진들 어떠하리城隍堂後垣頹落亦何如。(성황당후원퇴락역하여)

우리도 이같이 얽어져 백년까지 누리리라我輩若此爲不死亦何如。(아배약차위불사역하여)

(Based on the Hanja)

&quot;What shall it be: this or that?&quot;

&quot;The walls behind the temple of the city&#x27;s deity has fallen* - shall it be this?&quot;

&quot;Or if we survive together nonetheless - shall it be that?&quot;

(* Yi Pang-wŏn is declaring &quot;the death&quot; of the Goryeo Dynasty&#x27;s era.)

=== Chŏng Mong-ju&#x27;s &quot;sijo&quot; (poem) - &quot;Dansimga&quot; (단심가 / 丹心歌) ===

이몸이 죽고 죽어 일백 번 고쳐 죽어此身死了死了一百番更死了。(차신사료사료일백번갱사료)

백골이 진토되어 넋이라도 있고 없고白骨爲塵土魂魄有也無。(백골위진토혼백유무야)

임 향한 일편 단심이야 가실 줄이 있으랴向主一片丹心寧有改理也歟。(향주일편단심유개리여)

&quot;Though I die and die again a hundred times,&quot;

&quot;That my bones turn to dust, whether my soul remains or not,&quot;

&quot;Ever loyal to my Lord, how can this red heart ever fade away?&quot;

<text>Concordia Theological Seminary is a Lutheran seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana. It offers professional, master&#x27;s degrees, and doctoral degrees affiliated with training clergy and deaconesses for the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS).

==History==

=== Formation in Fort Wayne ===
In 1844, Frederick C. D. Wyneken, pastor of the Lutheran church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, began pastoral training of two young men. Wyneken took a call in 1845 to a congregation in Baltimore, Maryland, and was replaced by Wilhelm Sihler, who continued the training. Wyneken had earlier written to Wilhelm Loehe in Germany, requesting help in providing pastors for German Lutheran immigrants to the United States, and in August 1846 eleven theological students and their instructor arrived in Fort Wayne, having been sent by Loehe. The seminary was formally organized at that time, with Sihler becoming the first president. Classes were held in the parsonage, and a four-room house was rented for use as a dormitory.

The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod was organized in 1847, and in response to the new synod&#x27;s request, Loehe transferred ownership of the seminary to the synod. He continued to support the seminary by sending money, books, and students from Germany. Two years later the seminary purchased about east of Fort Wayne and erected the first building on its new campus.

Within the synod the seminary was referred to as the &quot;practical seminary&quot; because its purpose was to quickly provide pastors for congregations. It provided both pre-seminary and seminary instruction. The pre-seminary course of work was similar to that of a high school, and the seminary classes provided enough theological training to enable the graduates to serve the congregations. However, the seminary did not require knowledge of the Biblical languages (Greek and Hebrew).

=== Relocation to St. Louis ===

To protect its students from the draft during the American Civil War, the seminary moved, in 1861, to the campus of the synod&#x27;s academic seminary, Concordia Seminary, in St. Louis, Missouri. Missouri exempted theological students from the draft, while Indiana did not. C. F. W. Walther, who was already the president of the St. Louis seminary, became president of the practical seminary as well. However, there was friction between the two institutions among both faculty and students, in part due to the differences in academic rigor and purposes. In addition, the growth in enrollment in both seminaries led to overcrowding of the campus.

=== Relocation to Springfield ===
In 1874, the 29 pre-seminary students of the practical seminary, along with one instructor, were moved to the campus of the former Illinois State University in Springfield, Illinois. That campus had been purchased by Trinity Lutheran Church in that city in 1873 to start the Evangelical Lutheran Female College and Normal School, but inability to obtain suitable faculty had stopped those plans. In 1875, the practical seminary itself moved to the Springfield campus, with president F. A. Craemer and the pre-seminary instructor serving as the faculty. A third faculty member joined the staff in 1876.
At that time there were no particular entrance requirements. It was not until 1918 that completion of eighth grade was required of prospective students, the same year that an additional year of instruction was added to the pre-seminary course of study. The additional courses made it possible for pastors to obtain teaching certificates in states where pastors were not automatically eligible to teach in parochial schools. However, even in the 1920s the pastors graduating from the seminary generally had, except for the pastoral training, only the equivalent of a high school education.

In view of the relatively low level of academic training provided by the seminary, resolutions to close the seminary were introduced in the 1932 and 1935 synodical conventions; the one in 1935 initially passed by a 266 to 265 vote, but was then reconsidered and defeated, 283 to 256. Nevertheless, the seminary began making changes: Greek was made a required course; new students had to have had at least two years of high school, and accreditation by the state of Illinois was sought.

Starting in 1941, all entering students had to be high school graduates, allowing the seminary to discontinue all high school classes. Academic requirements were further strengthened in subsequent years. Entrance requirements were again raised, first to completion of two years of college, and again to prefer college graduates. Expectations for the faculty were also increased with the aim that all professors would have doctoral degrees. The American Association of Theological Schools accepted the seminary as a member in the fall of 1968. The Bachelor of Divinity degree which the seminary had awarded its graduates became fully accredited, and was replaced by the Master of Divinity degree in 1973.

=== Return to Fort Wayne ===
The seminary remained in Springfield until the synod reorganized its system of pastoral training and merged the program of Concordia Senior College of Fort Wayne with Concordia College in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1976, the seminary returned to Fort Wayne, where it inherited the Senior College&#x27;s award-winning campus, designed by Eero Saarinen.

<text>Turkey Run State Park, Indiana&#x27;s second state park, is in Parke County in the west-central part of the state along State Road 47, east of U.S. 41.

The first parcel of land was purchased for $40,200 in 1916, when Indiana&#x27;s state park system was established during the state&#x27;s centennial anniversary of its statehood. The origin of the name &quot;Turkey Run&quot; is unknown, but the most accepted theory is that wild turkeys would congregate for warmth in the gorges (or &quot;runs&quot;), where early settlers could easily trap and hunt them.

The Lusk Home and Mill Site and the Richard Lieber Log Cabin within the park&#x27;s grounds were included as individual sites on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 and 2001, respectively. The park itself was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Turkey Run also includes a system of trails, Rocky Hollow Falls Canyon Nature Preserve, a suspension bridge across Sugar Creek, camping sites, and other recreational areas. The Turkey Run Inn was built in 1919. Several guest cabins near the inn date from the 1930s and 1940s. The park draws some 700,000 visitors annually.

The park is 1 of 14 Indiana State Parks that were in the path of totality for the 2024 solar eclipse, with the park experiencing 43 seconds of totality.

==History==
===Early settlement===
The land that would become Turkey Run is the traditional territory of the Kiikaapoi, Peoria, Potawatomi and Myaamia Native American peoples. France was the first European nation to claim control over the area which was followed by the British as a result of the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Although the area in northern Parke County, Indiana, was once called Bloomingdale Glens, it is better known as Turkey Run. The origins of the nickname is uncertain, but it is believed to be due to the large number of wild turkeys in the area that took refuge for warmth in the gorges (or &quot;runs&quot;), which made it easy for early settlers to trap and hunt them.

The first white occupants of this wooded area was the Captain Salmon Lusk family. Salmon Lusk was a native of Vermont who served under William Henry Harrison at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. Captain Lusk received a tract of land at Turkey Run for his military service. His son, John, later inherited the property. Over the years, John Lusk received offers from lumber companies to sell the forested land, but he was a nature-lover and refused their offers. In 1882, however, he allowed the Indianapolis, Decatur, and Springfield Railroad to establish a summer resort on the property. The resort remained in operation until John Lusk&#x27;s death in 1915.

===Preservation===
In April 1915, after learning that the forested area at Turkey Run would be sold at public auction in May, Parke County resident Juliet V. Strauss, who was a newspaper and magazine columnist for the &quot;Rockville Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Indianapolis News&quot;, and the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, reportedly wrote a letter to Indiana governor Samuel M. Ralston urging him to save from timber harvesting. Strauss&#x27;s letter to Governor Ralston is believed to have prompted his decision to establish a Turkey Run Commission, which was assigned the task of preserving the forest. On April 27, 1915, the governor appointed Strauss to serve as a member of the commission along with William W. Woollen of Indianapolis and Vida Newsom of Columbus, Indiana. Richard Lieber, who was appointed chairman of the State Parks Memorial Committee of the Indiana Historical Commission, also became interested in preserving Turkey Run as part of a new state park system.

In November 1915, Lieber met with Governor Ralston to discuss the idea of creating a state parks system as a permanent memorial to Indiana&#x27;s centennial anniversary of statehood. Governor Ralston agreed to the proposal and appointed Lieber to the Turkey Run Commission in January 1916. (The Turkey Run Commission later merged with the Indiana Historical Commission&#x27;s State Parks Memorial Committee.) The state parks committee agreed to take on the task of establishing a state parks system in 1916 as part of Indiana&#x27;s centennial celebrations and hoped to raise funds from private donations to purchase three tracts of land. With the support of state government officials and the Indiana Historical Commission, state parks supporters launched a public campaign to increase awareness and persuade members of the public to donate funds to purchase the land at Turkey Run. (The state legislature had not appropriated funds for land acquisition.) The Indiana Historical Commission and the state parks committee set a target goal of obtaining $25,000 from private citizens and Governor Ralston designated the week of April 24, 1916, to collect the donated funds. The effort acquired about $20,000 in private donations for the purchase of the Turkey Run land.

===State park===
Despite its efforts, state park advocates failed in their initial attempt to secure the Turkey Run property for the new state park system. When the public auction took place on May 18, 1916, the Hoosier Veneer Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, made the successful bid to acquire the land for $30,200, surpassing the Indiana Historical Commission&#x27;s final bid of $30,100. Undeterred, Richard Lieber began negotiations with 
the lumber company and reached an agreement to purchase the land for $40,200 on November 11, 1916. Money to buy the land from the lumber company largely came from private donations that included a $5,065 contribution from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Association. Auto racing enthusiast Arthur C. Newby gave another $5,000 to assist with the purchase. While negotiations with the Hoosier Veneer Company were underway, Lieber and the state parks committee bought McCormick&#x27;s Creek Canyon in Owen County, Indiana, at auction on May 25, 1916. McCormick&#x27;s Creek State Park became Indiana&#x27;s first state park. When the state finally acquired Turkey Run in November 1916, the Parke County property became Indiana&#x27;s second state park. Turkey Run State Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019.

==Locale==
Turkey Run State Park is located about southwest of Shades State Park. Both parks are located along Sugar Creek, and both feature a gorge system formed by the drainage of the creek as it cuts down through sandstone bedrock. Mansfield sandstone is the specific type seen at Turkey Run, named after Mansfield, Indiana. Travel between the two parks crosses a flat glacial till plain and enters the gorge system. The Punchbowl on Turkey Run&#x27;s Trail 3 is an example of a pothole that was scoured out by glacial erratics caught in swirling backwash.

==Trails==

A system of trails offers hikers plenty of outing opportunities during the summer months when the drainage is relatively free of water. A suspension footbridge across Sugar Creek, the main drainage for Turkey Run and Shades state parks, provides pedestrian access to trails on the far side. Turkey Run&#x27;s Trail 3 is particularly noted for its ruggedness, including ladders and narrow but deep gorges. Floating down Sugar Creek through the park in either inner tubes, canoes, or kayaks is very popular in the summer months. There are , , and trips down Sugar Creek. In the spring, when heavy rains and snow melt flood the narrow gorges, more adventurous hikers go &quot;creek stomping&quot; through the narrow gorges; however, the fast-moving current, steep gorge walls, and unpredictable contours of the creek beds make this activity dangerous if the water level is high.

==Park geology==

The major features of the park are formed from erosion in Mansfield sandstone from the Mansfield formation. This formation was deposited during the Carboniferous period at the mouth of the ancient riverbed, where sediments collected and compacted. This swampy environment formed coal deposits that were mined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A collapsed entrance to a coal mine is still a major feature of the park.

During the Pleistocene Epoch, glacial meltwaters and their associated erosion carved the Mansfield sandstone bedrock into its distinct, present-day formations. Turkey Run&#x27;s terrain also includes many common features of glaciation such as glacial erratics, till, and scoured canyons caused by erosion from melting glacial waters.

==Rocky Hollow Falls Canyon Nature Preserve==
Rocky Hollow Falls Canyon Nature Preserve is a series of canyons cut into the sandstone. Rocky Hollow is the longest canyon and Falls Canyon has the only existing waterfall (seasonal) in the park. There are six designated trails through the preserve, each with its own unique micro-climate. Depending on the season, these trails may be impassable, muddy, or refreshing on a hot afternoon. The park&#x27;s suspension footbridge, originally built in 1917–18 across Sugar Creek, leads to the Rocky Hollow Falls Canyon Nature Preserve.

Rocky Hollow begins at above sea level on the northeast border of the park (County Road 280E) and drops to at Sugar Creek just above the suspension bridge. Bear Hollow and Falls Canyon drop a similar distance but in one-half or one-third of the length, respectively. The nature preserve was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974.

==Lusk Home and Mill Site==

The Lusk Home and Mill Site is one of the individual sites within the park that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The initial area that became Turkey Run State Park developed around the Lusk home, which was built in 1841 by Salmon Lusk. He also built a mill on the site in 1826. The Lusk home and mill site were added to the National Register on October 29, 1974.

==Lieber Log Cabin==

The Richard Lieber Log Cabin is another of the individual sites at Turkey Run that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built in 1848 from native tulip trees, the oldest of its kind in Indiana. Lieber Cabin was added to the National register on May 4, 2001.

The cabin is named in honor of Colonel Richard Lieber, the first director of Indiana&#x27;s state parks system and the conservationist who advocated for its creation as a permanent memorial to Indiana&#x27;scentennial anniversary of statehood. Lieber discovered the cabin during a thunderstorm in 1918 and convinced the owner to have it moved so it could serve as the administration building for the state park. All but the chimney was salvageable. An elderly man familiar with the chimney&#x27;s &quot;cat and clay&quot; style gave directions for making a new one using stone from an old bridge. The supports were originally of butternut, but are now of sassafras. The present-day cabin houses a museum honoring Lieber and the Indiana state park system. Lieber died at McCormicks Creek State Park in 1944 and his ashes were buried at the base of the Colonel Richard Lieber Memorial at Turkey Run.

==Other features==
Campsites at Turkey Run were first developed in 1964. The state park also includes Turkey Run Inn and cabins for overnight guests. The two-story inn was designed by Bishop, Knowlton and Carson architects and constructed circa 1919. Additions were completed in 1930, 1940, and circa 1970. The Civilian Conservation Corps built five double cabins near the inn in 1941; two family cabins were built near a maintenance shed on the property and date from the 1930s. The CCC also built a Nature Center at Turkey Run in 1942. The center originally served as a commissary. Its exterior was remodeled in 1986.

<doc id="430411" wikidata="Q580731" url="?curid=430411" title="Clerestory">
<text>In architecture, a clerestory ( ; , also clearstory, clearstorey, or overstorey; from Old French &quot;cler estor&quot;) is a high section of wall that contains windows above eye-level. Its purpose is to admit light, fresh air, or both.

Historically, a &quot;clerestory&quot; formed an upper level of a Roman basilica or of the nave of a Romanesque or Gothic church, the walls of which rise above the rooflines of the lower aisles and which are pierced with windows.

Clerestories have been used in transportation vehicles to provide additional lighting, ventilation, or headroom.

==History==
===Ancient world===
The technology of the clerestory appears to originate in Egyptian temples, where the lighting of the hall of columns was obtained over the stone roofs of the adjoining aisles, through gaps left in the vertical slabs of stone. Clerestories appeared in Egypt at least as early as the Amarna Period. Minoan palaces in Crete such as Knossos employed lightwells in addition to clerestories.

According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon&#x27;s Temple featured clerestory windows made possible by the use of a tall, angled roof and a central .

The clerestory was used in the Hellenistic architecture of classical antiquity. The Romans applied clerestories to basilicas of justice and to the basilica-like thermae and palaces.

===Early Christian and Byzantine basilicas===
Early Christian churches and some Byzantine churches, particularly in Italy, are based closely on the Roman basilica, and maintained the form of a central nave flanked by lower aisles on each side. The nave and aisles are separated by columns or piers, above which rises a wall pierced by clerestory windows.
===Romanesque period===
During the Romanesque period, many churches of the basilica form were constructed all over Europe. Many of these churches have wooden roofs with clerestories below them. Some Romanesque churches have barrel-vaulted ceilings with no clerestory. The development of the groin vault and ribbed vault made possible the insertion of clerestory windows.

Initially the nave of a large aisled and clerestoried church was of two levels: arcade and clerestory. During the Romanesque period, a third level was inserted between them, a gallery called the &quot;triforium&quot;. The triforium generally opens into space beneath the sloping roof of the aisle. This became a standard feature of later Romanesque and Gothic large abbey and cathedral churches. Sometimes another gallery set into the wall space above the triforium and below the clerestory. This feature is found in some late Romanesque and early Gothic buildings in France.

The oldest glass clerestory windows still in place are from the late eleventh century, found in Augsburg Cathedral in Bavaria, Germany.

===Gothic period===

In smaller churches, clerestory windows may be trefoils or quatrefoils. In some Italian churches they are ocular. In most large churches, they are an important feature, both for beauty and for utility. The ribbed vaulting and flying buttresses of Gothic architecture concentrated the weight and thrust of the roof, freeing wall-space for larger clerestory fenestration. Generally, in Gothic masterpieces, the clerestory is divided into bays by the vaulting shafts that continue the same tall columns that form the arcade separating the aisles from the nave.

The tendency from the early Romanesque period to the late Gothic period was for the clerestory level to become progressively taller and the size of the windows to get proportionally larger in relation to wall surface, emerging in works such as the Gothic architecture of Amiens Cathedral or Westminster Abbey, where their clerestories account for nearly a third of the height of the interior.

== Modern clerestory windows for energy-efficient buildings ==
Modern clerestories often are defined as vertical windows, located on high walls, extending up from the roofline, designed to allow light and breezes into a space, without compromising privacy. Factory buildings often are built with clerestory windows; modern housing designs sometimes include them as well.

Modern clerestory windows may have another especially important role, besides daylighting and ventilation: they can be part of passive solar strategies, in very energy-efficient buildings (passive houses and zero-energy buildings).

To that end, clerestories are used in conjunction with stone, brick, concrete, and other high-mass walls and floors, properly positioned to store solar heat gains during the hotter parts of the day – allowing the walls and the floor to act as a heat bank during the cooler parts of the day.

Clerestories – in passive solar strategies – should be properly located (typically in the sunny side of the building) and protected from the summer&#x27;s sun by rooflines, overhangs, recessed thick walls, or other architectural elements, in order to prevent overheating during the cooling season.

==Transportation==


Clerestory roofs were incorporated into the designs of many railway passenger cars and trams Commonwealth English) / streetcars (American English &amp; Canadian English) from about 1860 to the 1930s. They increased the daylight and ventilation available to passengers.

In the US, the railroad clerestory roof was also known as the &quot;lantern roof&quot;.

The first Pullman coaches in the UK had clerestory roofs. They were imported from the US and assembled at Derby, where Pullman set up an assembly plant in conjunction with the Midland Railway, a predecessor of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The first coach, a sleeping car named &quot;Midland&quot;, was assembled and ready for trial-running in January 1874.

The last clerestory-roofed trains on the London Underground were the &#x27;Q&#x27; stock, which were withdrawn from operation in 1971.

Clerestories were also used in early British double-decker buses, giving better ventilation and headroom in the centre corridor, as well as better illumination.

The Volkswagen Type 2 Kombi, or Transport, commonly called the Microbus, came in a deluxe version with clerestory windows. VW made the Samba from 1961 to 1967 in several versions, which had as many as 23 windows, and it is highly prized by collectors.

In the UK, the style is also known as &quot;mollycroft roof&quot;, especially in Romany caravans, such as vardos, and other caravans.

<text>Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng (; 1316–1388), also romanized as Choi Young, was a Korean general born in Hongseong or Cheorwon during the Goryeo period. He became a national hero after he put down Cho Il-sin&#x27;s Rebellion (). He also participated in the Red Turban Rebellions and later allied with the Ming dynasty to overthrow the Mongol Yuan dynasty. In his final years, General Ch&#x27;oe was betrayed and executed by his former subordinate Yi Sŏng-gye, who founded the Joseon dynasty of Korea, bringing an end to the Goryeo period.

==Early years==

Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng was born into the prestigious Cheorwon (more recently known as Dongju) Ch&#x27;oe noble clan as the fifth generation descendant of Ch&#x27;oe Yu-ch&#x27;ŏng, the Grand Scholar of Jiphyeonjeon, the Royal Academy, and the son of Ch&#x27;oe Wŏn-jik. He was raised in a strict austere lifestyle, befitting a noble aristocratic family of Goryeo. He paid little heed to what he wore and ate, and eschewed fine garments and other comforts even after becoming famous and successful. He disliked men who desired expensive articles, and he viewed simplicity as a virtue. Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng&#x27;s motto, left to him by his father, was to regard gold as nothing but mere rocks.

==Military career==

=== Cho Il-sin and Japan ===
Based on his character and beliefs, Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng was well-suited for the military. In the military, Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng quickly gained the confidence of both his men and the king due to numerous victories against Japanese pirates (Wokou) who began raiding the Korean coast around 1350.

In 1352, at the age of 36, Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng became a national hero after he successfully put down a rebellion by Cho Il-sin when insurgents surrounded the royal palace, killing many officials.

=== Red Turban rebellions ===
As Goryeo was a tributary, or &quot;Bumaguk (son-in-law nation)&quot;, to the Mongol Yuan dynasty since 1259, Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng was sent to help the Yuan forces quash insurgents during the Red Turban Rebellion in northern China. In 1354, at the age of 39, he deployed to northern China with 2,000 Korean mounted archers, and was reinforced in Kanbaluk by 20,000 veterans of the Goryeo Tumens. Together they suppressed the Red Turban Rebellion and returned home to Goryeo. However, later the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the uprisings of Zhu Yuanzhang, who founded the Ming dynasty, and Chen Youliang, who founded the Chen Han dynasty.

Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng&#x27;s success in nearly 30 different battles won him even more fame and favor at home. Upon returning to Korea, he dutifully reported to King Gongmin about the internal problems troubling the waning Yuan dynasty, which gave the king the idea that the time was opportune to reclaim some of the northern territories previously lost to the Mongols. General Ch&#x27;oe fought to recover various towns west of the Yalu River to the great delight of King Gongmin. In 1356, he attacked and received the surrender of the Mongol-Korean Darughachi of Ssangseong Chonggwanbu in what is now Wonsan, where the former Goryeo ruling aristocrats had surrendered their fiefdoms to the Mongols prior to Goryeo&#x27;s national surrender of sovereignty in 1259. The surrendering darughachi of Ssangseong was none other than Yi Cha-ch&#x27;un, whose son, the deputy darhughachi, was Yi Sŏng-gye, the future founder of the Joseon dynasty.

In 1360, Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng defeated the Red Turbans during the Red Turban invasions of Goryeo. On April 15, 1363, Kim Yong, a senior Goryeo official attempted to assassinate the king while he was staying at Hŭngwang-sa Temple. General Ch&#x27;oe and his army were able to defeat the rebels and rescue the king, arresting the rebellion&#x27;s ringleader, Kim Yong.

Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng served briefly as the mayor of Pyongyang, where his efforts at increasing crop production and mitigating famine won him even more attention as a national hero. In 1364, he distinguished himself further when he defeated a former prince of Goryeo, Prince Deokheung, who tried to overthrow King Gongmin for asserting independence from the Yuan dynasty. Ch&#x27;oe Yu, appointed by Empress Gi of Yuan to accompany Deokheung, invaded Goryeo with 10,000 Mongol cavalry to overthrow the rebellious king. Upon his crossing of the Yalu River, the provincial commander, An U-gyŏng () fought against him until Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng&#x27;s arrival. Their combined forces defeated the Mongol Tumen of 10,000, solidifying the final defiance and independence of Goryeo dynasty from the Mongols in 1364.

=== Yuan-Ming dynasties ===
In 1368, when the new Ming dynasty of China offered an alliance against the Mongols, King Gongmin ordered Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng to invade the remaining Mongol garrisons in Manchuria. Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng maneuvered north of the Yalu River and captured and the city of Liaoyang in 1370, but this did not lead to a permanent settlement.

==Betrayal and redemption==
Following a dream that he thought predicted that a Buddhist monk would save his life, King Gongmin promoted a monk named Sin Ton to a lofty position within his court and allowed him considerable influence. At first, Sin Ton toiled to improve the lives of the peasants despite great opposition from the ministers; however, with the king&#x27;s support Sin Ton grew increasingly ruthless and corrupt. Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng, who vigorously opposed corruption in the kingdom, found himself at odds with the monk, and subsequently, Sin Ton engineered false accusations of misconduct against Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng that resulted in a punishment of six years in exile and brought him dangerously close to execution. However, after Sin Ton&#x27;s death in 1374, Gongmin restored Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng to his previous position.

In 1374, the Mongol horse herders on Tamna Island rebelled against the Goryeo court after being asked for their horses to send to the Ming as supplies against their fellow Mongols of the Yuan. To crush the rebellion, Goryeo assembled a force of 314 ships and 25,605 troops. General Ch&#x27;oe was picked as its commander. On October 4, Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng landed on Tamna and engaged the Mongols, who fought tenaciously, but Ch&#x27;oe&#x27;s forces quickly freed the island. The three ringleaders of the revolt were executed and their heads sent to the capital. Then, in 1376, the Japanese pirates advanced into Goryeo and captured the city of Gongju. With the new gunpowder recipe obtained by scientist Ch&#x27;oe Mu-sŏn, General Ch&#x27;oe and his subordinate, Yi Sŏng-gye, routed and defeated the pirates, and reclaimed Gongju.

==Final years==

General Ch&#x27;oe was betrayed and executed by his former subordinate Yi Sŏng-gye.

In 1388, General Yi Sŏng-gye was ordered to use his armies to push the Ming forces out of the Liaodong peninsula. Yi Sŏng-gye opposed the northern expedition, citing four reasons:
# A smaller nation should not attack a larger nation, as it goes against the Confucian order of the world
# It is harsh to campaign during the summer farming season, as it will result in a poor harvest for the populace
# With the bulk of the men away to the north, Japanese pirates will have free rein in the south
# Monsoon rains will reduce the effectiveness of composite bows, the army&#x27;s main weapon, and will encourage the spread of infectious diseases in the camps.
General Ch&#x27;oe ordered the invasion nevertheless, supported by the young King U. However, knowing the support he enjoyed from high-ranking government officials and the general populace, Yi Sŏng-gye decided to return to the capital, Gaegyeong, and trigger a coup d&#x27;état. This incident later became famous as the Wihwado Retreat and became the first sign of the change of dynasty.

When Yi Sŏng-gye returned to the capital, Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng put up a gallant defense at the palace, but was outnumbered and overwhelmed. General Ch&#x27;oe was defeated, captured, and banished to Goyang and was later beheaded by Yi Sŏng-gye&#x27;s government. Before the execution, Ch&#x27;oe was famously known to have predicted that due to his unjust demise, grass would never grow on his grave. Grass did not grow on his grave until 1976 and it became known as &quot;Jeokbun&quot; (), which means red grave, because of the red soil.

<text>Giuseppe Tornatore (born 27 May 1956) is an Italian film director and screenwriter. He is considered one of the directors who brought critical acclaim back to Italian cinema. In a career spanning over 30 years he is best known for directing and writing drama films such as &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Fine&quot;, &quot;The Legend of 1900&quot;, &quot;Malèna&quot;, &quot;Baarìa&quot; and &quot;The Best Offer&quot;. His most noted film is &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;, for which Tornatore won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He has also directed several advertising campaigns for Dolce &amp; Gabbana.

Tornatore is also known for his long-standing association with composer Ennio Morricone, who composed music for thirteen Tornatore feature films since 1988.

==Life and career==

Born in Bagheria, near Palermo, Tornatore developed an interest in acting and the theatre from at least the age of 16 and put on works by Luigi Pirandello and Eduardo De Filippo.

He worked initially as a freelance photographer. Then, switching to cinema, he made his debut with &quot;Le minoranze etniche in Sicilia&quot; (&quot;The Ethnic Minorities in Sicily&quot;), a collaborative documentary film which won a Salerno Festival prize. He then worked for RAI before releasing his first full-length film,&quot;The Professor&quot;, in 1985. This evoked a positive response from audiences and critics alike and Tornatore was awarded the &quot;Silver Ribbon&quot; for &quot;best new director&quot;.

In 1988, a collaboration with producer Franco Cristaldi gave birth to Tornatore&#x27;s best known screen work: &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;, a film narrating the life of a successful film director who has returned to his native town in Sicily for the funeral of his mentor. This obtained worldwide success and won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Subsequently, Tornatore released several other films. In 2007 he won the Silver George for Best Director at the 29th Moscow International Film Festival for &quot;The Unknown Woman&quot;.

==Personal life==
Tornatore describes himself as &quot;one who does not believe and who regrets this&quot;. His brother, Francesco Tornatore, is a producer.

<doc id="430417" wikidata="Q400858" url="?curid=430417" title="Ahmed Wali Karzai">
<text>Ahmed Wali Karzai (, , 1961 – 12 July 2011) was an Afghan politician who served as Chairman of the Kandahar Provincial Council from 2005 until his assassination. He was the younger paternal half-brother of former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and an elder of the Popalzai tribe. Wali Karzai had formerly lived in the United States, where he managed a restaurant owned by his family. He returned to Afghanistan following the removal of the Taliban government in late 2001. He had been accused of political corruption and was allegedly on the CIA payroll. He was assassinated at his residence by one of his close bodyguards, Sardar Mohammad, on 12 July 2011.

==Early life and political career==
Karzai was born in 1961 in the village of Karz in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. He is the son of Abdul Ahad Karzai and brother of Hamid Karzai, Mahmud Karzai and Qayum Karzai. He attended Habibia High School in Kabul but was not able to finish his studies due to the Soviet–Afghan War. He travelled to neighbouring Pakistan and then immigrated to the United States. Wali Karzai managed an Afghan restaurant in Chicago that was owned by his family. Ahmad Wali returned to Pakistan in the late 1980s to help his father, Abdul Ahad.

He came to political prominence in Afghanistan following the US occupation of the country in 2001, where he was a key ally of the US military in the country&#x27;s south. He was elected to the Kandahar Provincial Council in 2005 and exercised influence in the province to the extent that he was described as &quot;effectively the governor&quot;. At the time of his death, he was the council&#x27;s chairman.

A few days before his death, Ahmed Wali Karzai appeared on a British television programme, &quot;Afghanistan: The Unknown Country,&quot; presented by Lyse Doucet, at his home in Kandahar, talking about public perceptions of him. Doucet said: &quot;Like most strong men, he depended on family and fellow tribesmen to protect him.&quot;

==Allegations of corruption==
A June 2009 U.S. embassy cable alleged that much of the actual business of running the Afghan city of Kandahar &quot;takes place out of public sight, where Ahmed Wali Karzai operates, parallel to formal government structures, through a network of political clans that use state institutions to protect and enable licit and illicit enterprises.&quot; In addition, James Risen of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and others stated that Ahmed Wali Karzai may have been involved in the Afghan opium and heroin trade. This was denied by Karzai, who called the charges political propaganda and stated he was a &quot;victim of vicious politics.&quot;

In meetings with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, including a 2006 session with former US Ambassador to Afghanistan, Ronald E. Neumann, the CIA&#x27;s station chief and their British counterparts, American officials talked about the rumors in hopes that the president might move his brother out of the country, said several people who took part in or were briefed on the talks. &quot;We thought the concern expressed to Karzai might be enough to get him out of there,&quot; one official said. President Karzai has resisted, however, demanding clear-cut evidence of wrongdoing, several officials said. &quot;We don&#x27;t have the kind of hard, direct evidence that you could take to get a criminal indictment,&quot; a White House official said. Ahmed Wali Karzai dismissed the allegations as politically motivated attacks by longtime rival groups in his country.

Before the 2009 Afghan presidential election, Wali Karzai and Sher Mohammad Akhundzada, former governor of the Helmand Province and a member of the Upper House of the Afghan parliament, were accused of vote rigging. After the election, reports mentioned that all those running in the election were involved in electoral fraud.

==CIA connections==
In October 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Ahmed Wali Karzai received payments from the Central Intelligence Agency for &quot;a variety of services&quot;, including the recruitment of the Kandahar Strike Force, an Afghan paramilitary force run by the CIA in the Kandahar region. It also stated that he was paid for allowing the CIA and U.S. special forces to rent the former residence of Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar. However, Karzai has denied taking any payment from the CIA. U.S. Senator John Kerry and former Afghan Ambassador to the United States, Said Tayeb Jawad, defended Karzai in recent years, Kerry saying &quot;We should not condemn Ahmed Wali Karzai or damage our critical relations with his brother, President Karzai, on the basis of newspaper articles or rumors&quot; and Jawad saying, &quot;There is presence of the intelligence, there&#x27;s presence of many institutions of the United States and NATO countries in Afghanistan, why don&#x27;t they come up with a clear evidence of any corruption involving the president or his family?&quot;

==Assassination==
Karzai survived a number of assassination attempts by Taliban militants and at least two attacks against his office in Kandahar: one in November 2008 and the other in April 2009. According to Karzai himself, he had survived a total of nine assassination attempts.

On 12 July 2011, Karzai was assassinated by his long-time head of security, Sardar Mohammad. Reports say that Wali was shot twice with a pistol, once in the head and once in the chest, as he was coming out of the bathroom inside his residence. Abdul Raziq, Police Chief of Kandahar, stated that the assailant Sardar Mohammad was well known by the Karzai family. He had served as Wali Karzai&#x27;s most trusted security guard for the last seven years. &quot;As he entered Wali&#x27;s room, Wali came out of his bathroom. Mohammad fired twice at Wali without any conversation passing between the two. Wali received one bullet in the chest and second in the head,&quot; Abdul Raziq said. The assailant was immediately killed by other bodyguards and his body was then hanged at a city square in public view. In the meantime, Karzai&#x27;s body was taken to Mirwais Hospital in Kandahar.

Thousands of people turned up for his funeral the next day, led by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, and many more waited in buses where his body lay to be taken to his hometown of Karz. Security was tightened around the funeral procession and some reports indicated Hamid Karzai&#x27;s elite security team were deployed to secure Kandahar, where the funeral was held. At the funeral procession Hamid Karzai issued a message to the Taliban: Hamid Karzai&#x27;s spokesman Waheed Omer said that &quot;We know we live in a dangerous country. We know that security has to be tight all the time and the president knows [this]. He&#x27;s got good security and that is not a worry for the president. The president is upset, he is still in grief, about the death of his brother. Wali was a very close brother of the president.&quot; En route to the funeral Helmand Governor Gulab Mangal escaped an assassination attempt, while later in the evening two more blasts went off in Kandahar. Though Hamid Karzai led the funeral procession, he was not present at a memorial service which was attacked by a suicide bomber killing the senior cleric of the mosque Hikmatullah Hikmat, the head of the Provincial Ulema Council, who died along with three others while 13 others were also wounded.

===Reactions===
President Hamid Karzai issued a statement on the day his brother died, saying: &quot;My younger brother was martyred in his house today. This is the life of all Afghan people, I hope these miseries which every Afghan family faces will one day end.&quot; Afghan families, every one of us, have suffered from it, and we hope, God willing, for our suffering to be over. US General David Petraeus, other top NATO personnel serving in Afghanistan, officials at the White House and many world leaders condemned the assassination.

Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi claimed that one of their agents was behind the assassination saying, &quot;Today in Kandahar city, Hamid Karzai&#x27;s brother was killed during the Operation al-Badr... We hired a person by the name of Sadar Mohammad, who was hired for this job for some time now. Ahmed Wali Karzai was punished for all his wrongdoings.&quot;

However, according to &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, the Taliban has &quot;a dubious record of claiming responsibility for attacks it had nothing to do with&quot;, and its claim has been denied by several sources. Abdul Ghafar Sayedzada, head of the counter-terrorism department at the Interior Ministry, told Reuters that &quot;It appears Ahmed Wali Karzai has been killed by one of his bodyguard, and there was nobody from outside involved.&quot; The news was confirmed by Zalmai Ayubi, the spokesman for Kandahar province, as well as by Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior. Following the killing, police were mobilised in Kandahar and helicopters were seen overhead as checkpoints were locked down leading towards the hospital his body was taken to.

===Investigations===
Investigators believe that Sardar Mohammad may have been a Taliban sleeper agent or a government defector. Mahmud Karzai, Karzai&#x27;s other brother, stated that Sardar Mohammad traveled to the Pakistani city of Quetta within the past three months to meet with the Shura Council of the Taliban. Mahmoud Karzai claimed that he has been acting very erratically in recent weeks, including sleeping poorly, moving from house to house during nights, acting suspiciously toward his men and demanding to know who they were talking to on their mobile phones.

<text>Days of Being Wild is a 1990 Hong Kong drama film written and directed by Wong Kar-Wai. Starring some of the best-known actors and actresses in Hong Kong, including Leslie Cheung, Andy Lau, Maggie Cheung, Carina Lau, Jacky Cheung and Tony Leung, the film marks the first collaboration between Wong and cinematographer Christopher Doyle, with whom he has since made six more films.

It forms the first part of an informal trilogy, together with &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; (2000) and &quot;2046&quot; (2004).

==Plot==
The movie begins in 1960 Hong Kong.

Yuddy, a smooth-talking playboy seduces Li-zhen but is uninterested in pursuing a serious relationship with her. Li-zhen, who wants to marry him, is heartbroken and decides to leave. Yuddy moves on to a new relationship with vivacious cabaret dancer Mimi. His friend Zeb is also attracted to her but she doesn&#x27;t reciprocate his feelings.

Yuddy has a tense relationship with his adoptive mother Rebecca, a former prostitute, after she reveals that he is adopted. He also doesn&#x27;t approve of her choice of lovers much younger than her who he thinks are taking advantage of her wealth. She initially refuses to reveal who his birth mother is but eventually relents and tells him that she lives in the Philippines.

Li-zhen finds solace in Tide, a policeman who does his rounds near Yuddy&#x27;s house. Tide dreams of becoming a sailor but he chooses to be a policeman to stay and look after his mother. Li-zhen talks about her failed love affair, her successful cousin&#x27;s impending marriage and how she misses home. Li-zhen, who works at the ticket stall of a soccer stadium, promises Tide a free ticket to a match of his choice and Tide tells her to call him on a phone booth he passes every night if she ever needs anyone to talk to. Their near-romance is hinted at but never materializes. When his mother passes, Tide leaves to become a sailor.

Meanwhile, Yuddy decides to find his birth mother and leaves for the Philippines, giving his car to Zeb and without informing Mimi. Mimi is distraught and resolves to follow him. Zeb, his love still unrequited, sells Yuddy&#x27;s car to finance her trip and asks her to come back to him if she doesn&#x27;t find Yuddy. Yuddy finds his mother&#x27;s house but she refuses to see him.

Tide, now a sailor on a stopover in the Philippines, finds a drunk Yuddy passed out on the street and brings him to his hotel room. Yuddy doesn&#x27;t recognise him but accepts his assistance. He gets into a fight at the railway station over payment for an American passport and stabs a man. Tide saves him and they escape aboard a train. Tide asks him if he remembers what happened on a particular date to an exact minute, referring to something he told Li-zhen at the start of their courtship. He says that he remembers and tells him it would be best to tell Li-zhen that he doesn&#x27;t. Tide returns from a conversation with the train conductor to find Yuddy shot to death.

A final sequence shows Mimi having arrived in the Philippines, Li-zhen closing up at the ticket stall and a phone at the booth ringing.

The movie ends with a shot of a slick young man, smoking and readying himself in a darkened room.

==Box office==
&quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; grossed HK$9,751,942 in its Hong Kong run, a number that would become typical for a Wong Kar Wai film. With the starry cast, this figure was considered a disappointment. Still, the film was successful enough to warrant a parody (&quot;The Days of Being Dumb&quot;, which also featured Tony Leung and Jacky Cheung), and now routinely tops Hong Kong critics&#x27; lists of the best local productions.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; uses a young man&#x27;s struggle to come to terms with a family secret as the foundation for a beautifully filmed drama with a darkly dreamy allure&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 93 out of 100 based on 21 critic reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The film ranked at number three on the Hong Kong Film Awards Association (HKFAA)&#x27;s 2005 list of The Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures. It placed at number 37 on the &quot;Asian Cinema 100 List&quot; at the 20th Busan International Film Festival in 2015.

==Home media==
The film debuted on the Blu-ray format for the first time in the United States on March 23, 2021 in a collection of 7 Wong Kar-wai films by the Criterion Collection.

<doc id="430420" wikidata="Q128862" url="?curid=430420" title="Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000">
<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 is a family of dual-spool, axial-flow, high-bypass turbofan aircraft engines produced by Pratt &amp; Whitney as the successor to the JT9D.

It was first run in April 1984, was FAA certified in July 1986, and was introduced in June 1987.

With thrust ranging from , it is used on many wide-body aircraft.

==Development==

The 52,000–62,000 lbf (230–275 kN), -fan PW4000 made its first run in April 1984, was FAA certified in July 1986, and was introduced in June 1987.
It powers the Airbus A300-600 and Airbus A310-300, Boeing 747-400 and 767-200/300, and McDonnell Douglas MD-11 widebodies.

Development of the , -fan version began in December 1991 for the Airbus A330, was FAA certified in August 1993, and made its first flight two months later.
It received 90min Extended-range Twin-engine Operations (ETOPS) approval at introduction in December 1994, and 180min ETOPS approval in July 1995.
In January 2000, it was the A330 market leader with more than half of the installed base and one million hours, more than twice that of each competitor.
The Advantage 70 upgrade package for the PW4168A, which powered around one-third of the active Airbus A330 fleet, was launched at the 2006 Farnborough Airshow, increasing thrust to 70,000 lbf (311 kN), and reducing fuel burn by about 1.2% as well as overall operating costs by as much as 20%.
For the Boeing 777, the , -fan version development began in October 1990, achieved in May 1993, and was approved for 180min ETOPS at service entry in June 1995.The 777 launch engine, it entered service on 7 June 1995, with United Airlines.
The PW4090 entered service in March 1997. The PW4098 received FAA certification in July 1998 and was introduced on the Boeing 777-300 in September 1999 but was a few years later discontinued due to core temperature problems and fuel burn that was not appealing to airlines..

In 2000, over 2,000 PW4000 engines had accumulated over 40 million hours of service with 75 operators.
In 30 years between June 1987 and 2017, more than 2,500 engines have been delivered, logging more than 135 million flight hours.

==Design==

The PW4000 has a dispatch reliability rate of 99.96% and is approved for ETOPS 180.
The average engine stays on wing 13,500 flight hours before a shop visit (a Shop Visit Rate of 0.073 per thousand hours).
It is claimed to be cumulatively 3.4 dB quieter than other engines in its class.

Like other modern aircraft power plants, it has a Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), for better fuel economy and reliability. Furthermore, single-crystal alloys allows higher temperature capability and PW&#x27;s Floatwall combustor liners improve durability and maintainability.
Also, the Talon (&quot;Technology for Affordable Low NOx&quot;) single-row combustor improves fuel-air mixing, for over 10% better NOx, CO, and HC emissions.

==Variants and applications==

The PW4000 series engine family uses a numbering systematic with the last three digits (PW 4&quot;XYZ&quot;) as identification of the application and thrust power:&lt;br&gt; 
* &quot;X&quot; describes the aircraft manufacturer for which the engine is approved. A &quot;0&quot; stands for Boeing; &quot;1&quot; for Airbus; and &quot;4&quot; for the McDonnell Douglas MD-11.
* &quot;YZ&quot; denotes the certified thrust in US pounds (lbf) in pro-mile fraction.
Example: A PW4090 identifies a PW4000 series engine certified for Boeing (777-200ER) and has a certified thrust of 90,000 lbf.
===PW4000-94===
Variants: PW4052, PW4056, PW4060, PW4062, PW4062A, PW4152, PW4156A, PW4156, PW4158, PW4460 and PW4462.&lt;br&gt;
Thrust range: 231–276 kN (52,000 lbf – 62,000 lbf)&lt;br&gt;
Applications:
* Airbus A300-600
* Airbus A310-300
* Boeing 747-400, Boeing Dreamlifter (and Scaled Composites Stratolaunch)
* Boeing 767-200/-300/-400(Including ER Version and Boeing Converted Freighter version except -300F)/-2C/Boeing KC-46A

Applications: the engine variants are designed exclusively for Airbus A330-200 and -300 (Note that this does not include the A330neo: -800 or -900 nor the BelugaXL (A330-700)).
===PW4000-112===
Variants: PW4074/74D, PW4077/77D, PW4084/84D, PW4090 and PW4098.&lt;br&gt;
Thrust range: 329–436 kN (74,000 lbf – 98,000 lbf)&lt;br&gt; 
Applications: the engine variants are designed exclusively for Boeing 777-200, -200ER, -300 (the first generation 777 or 777 Classics). (Note that this does not include the second generation 777 -200LR, -300ER or F which are powered exclusively by the GE90).

==Accidents and incidents==

===Involving PW4000-112 series===

; 17 March 2003, United Airlines Flight 842
: A PW4090 failed bearing caused the engine loss and the diversion to Kona, Hawaii, of a Boeing 777-200ER bound from Auckland, New Zealand, to Los Angeles. At 190 minutes this was the longest single-engine diversion on record at the time. 

; 27 May 2016, Korean Air Flight 2708
: A PW4090 uncontained turbine failure caused an aborted take-off, on a Boeing 777-300 at Tokyo-Haneda Airport. 

; 13 February 2018, United Airlines Flight 1175
: A PW4077 fan blade failure caused significant engine damage to a Boeing 777-200 on descent into Honolulu from San Francisco. Routine fan blade inspection in 2005 and 2010 had shown a crack in the blade&#x27;s metal structure but insufficiently trained inspectors had confused it for a defect in the paint. In 2019, an airworthiness directive mandated recurring engine inspections based on usage cycles.

; 4 December 2020, Japan Airlines Flight 904 
: A PW4074 engine had a fan blade failure and associated engine cowl damage as the Boeing 777-200 was climbing out of Okinawa. As of March 2021 the investigation is ongoing.

; 20 February 2021, United Airlines Flight 328
: Boeing 777-200&#x27;s right hand PW4077-112 had a blade failure shortly after taking off from Denver, causing significant engine damage. Two fan blades had broken off: one had suffered metal fatigue and possibly chipped another blade which also broke off. The failed blade was compliant with the inspection interval set by the FAA following the 2018 incident. The FAA grounded the affected 777s and issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive on 23 February, requiring a Thermal Acoustic Inspection (TAI) of the -112 fan blades before next flight. Japanese authorities and the UK&#x27;s CAA followed suit, grounding 69 in-service and 59 in-storage Boeing 777s. Most carriers had voluntarily grounded the aircraft before, except South Korea&#x27;s Jin Air&#x27;s four aircraft. As of March 2021 the investigation is ongoing.

===Involving PW4000-100 series===
; 6 May 2014, Vietnam Airlines VN-A371
: Uncontained failure of a PW4168A low-pressure turbine&#x27;s stage four causing an Airbus A330 rejected take-off at Melbourne Airport in Australia.

; 13 February 2018, Delta Air Lines Flight 55
: PW4168 fire in an Airbus A330-200 climbing from Lagos (Nigeria) at 2000 feet.

; 18 April 2018, Delta Air Lines Flight 30
: Airbus A330-323&#x27;s PW4168A fire after takeoff from Atlanta, investigated by the NTSB and the French BEA.

===Involving PW4000-94 series===
; 7 June 2017, Delta Air Lines flight 276
: Metallic debris in a PW4056 tailpipe and a 360-degree crack in the LP turbine case just forward of the rear flange caused a Boeing 747-400 cruising at FL320 to return to Tokyo Narita. All of the HPC airfoils from the 5th to the 15th stage were damaged with nicks, dents, and tears to the leading and trailing edges and/or were broken off at various lengths above the blade root platforms. The HPT and LPT also had extensive damage, and the LPT case had a 360° split in line with the 6th stage turbine rotor. The NTSB reports 38 airfoil fractures of the 5th stage compressor blade before the part was updated.

; 20 February 2021, Longtail Aviation Flight 5504
: Boeing 747-412BCF PW4056 failure shortly after taking off from Maastricht Aachen Airport : falling turbine blades slightly injured two persons on the ground, the airplane was able to land safely at Liège Airport.

; 28 March 2022, United Airlines Flight 134
: Boeing 767 powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4060 engines experienced fan blade separation on the right-side (number 2) engine during a flight from New York to Zürich. The incident occurred over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft diverted to Shannon, Ireland, and landed safely with 123 persons on board.

==Specifications==
The PW4000 is produced in three distinct models, with differing LP systems to address different thrust needs.

<text>Europa is a steel-hulled barque registered in the Netherlands. Originally she was a German lightship, named &quot;Senator Brockes&quot; and built in 1911 at the H.C. Stülcken &amp; Sohn shipyard in Hamburg, Germany. Until 1977, she was in use by the German Federal Coast Guard as a lightship on the river Elbe. A Dutchman bought the vessel (or what was left of her) in 1985 and in 1994 she was fully restored as a barque, a three-mast rigged vessel, and retrofitted for special-purpose sail-training.

&quot;Europa&quot; cruises worldwide and accepts paying voyage crew (trainees) for short or long trip segments, including ocean crossings, Sail Training Association races, and annual voyages to Antarctica, and between South Georgia, Tristan da Cunha, and Cape Town.

In 2002 and 2013 she rounded Cape Horn. In 2010 she participated in Velas Sudamerica 2010, an historical Latin American tour by eleven tall ships to celebrate the bicentennial of the first national governments of Argentina and Chile.

In 2013-2014 &quot;Europa&quot; circumnavigated the world together with two other Dutch tall ships, &quot;Tecla&quot; and &quot;Oosterschelde&quot;. They sailed from South Africa to Mauritius, Australia and New Zealand. In October 2013 &quot;Europa&quot; participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney. From New Zealand, the ship sailed an official Cape Horn rounding (October - December 2013). In June 2014 &quot;Europa&quot; completed her circumnavigation by arriving in Amsterdam.

On 20 May 2023, Europa fell over during an attempt to transfer the steel-hulled barque back into the water from drydock at a Cape Town ship repair facility. One crewmember was injured in the attempt.

<text>George Habash (; 1 August 1926 – 26 January 2008) was a Palestinian politician and physician who founded the Marxist–Leninist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).

Habash was born in Lydda, Mandatory Palestine, in 1926. In 1948, while a medical student at the American University of Beirut, he went to his home town of Lydda during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, when the city&#x27;s Arab Palestinian population including his family were driven out in what became known as the Lydda Death March that led to the death of his sister. In 1951, after graduating first in his class from medical school, Habash worked in Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan and ran a clinic in Amman. He later relocated to Syria and Lebanon. 

In 1967, after being sidelined in the Palestine Liberation Organization by Yasser Arafat, he founded the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a leftist movement which opposes the existence of Israel and advocates for a single democratic and secular state in the entire region. In the 1970 Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings, Habash masterminded the hijackings of four Western airliners to Jordan, which led to the Black September conflict, and his subsequent exile to Lebanon. He remained opposed to a two-state solution even after the PLO signed the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993. He resigned as secretary general of the PFLP due to ill health in 2000, and died after a heart attack in 2008. 

He was also known by his kunya as &quot;Al-Hakim&quot; (, ).

==Early life==

Habash was born in Lydda (today&#x27;s Lod) to a Greek Orthodox Christian Palestinian family in 1926. As a child, he sang in the church choir. In 1948, 19-year-old Habash, a medical student at the American University of Beirut, went to his home town of Lydda during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War to help his family. While he was there, the Israel Defense Forces attacked the city and as a result, most of its civilian population was forced to leave in what became known as the Lydda Death March. They marched for three days without food or water until they reached the Arab armies&#x27; front lines, which led to his sister&#x27;s death. Habash and his remaining family became refugees and were not allowed to return home. He later finished his education at the AUB and graduated in 1951.

Political thinkers who were influences on Habash at this period included Constantin Zureiq, whose lectures at AUB on &#x27;Arab nationalism and the Zionist danger&#x27; in the late 1940s and early 1950s Habash had attended, and Sati&#x27; al-Husri an Arab Muslim intellectual who emphasized national cohesiveness, territorial patriotism, and loyalty to the state, and gave priority to Arab unity over Islamic unity.
In 1951, after graduating first in his class from medical school, Habash worked in refugee camps in Jordan and ran a clinic with Wadie Haddad in Amman. He firmly believed that the state of Israel should be ended by all possible means, including political violence. In an effort to recruit the Arab world to this cause, Habash founded the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM) in 1951 and aligned the organization with Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s Arab nationalist ideology.
He was implicated in the 1957 coup attempt in Jordan, which had originated among Palestinian members of the National Guard. Habash was convicted in absentia, after having gone underground when Hussein of Jordan proclaimed martial law and banned all political parties. In 1958 he fled to Syria (then part of the United Arab Republic), but was forced to return to Beirut in 1961 by the tumultuous breakup of the UAR.

Habash was a leading member of the Palestine Liberation Organization until 1967 when he was sidelined by Fatah leader Yasser Arafat, with whom he had a complex relationship described as a mix of &quot;camaraderie and rivalry&quot; and &quot;a love-hate relationship&quot;. In response, Habash founded the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.

==Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine==
In 1964 he began reorganizing the ANM, regrouping the Palestinian members of the organization into a &quot;regional command.&quot; After the Six-Day War in 1967, disillusion with Nasser became widespread. This prompted the foundation, led by Habash, of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) as a front of several Palestinian factions, like the &quot;heroes of return&quot; and &quot;Palestinian Liberation Front&quot;, along with the ANM on 11 December, when he also became its first secretary-general. Habash was arrested by Abd al-Karim al-Jundi and briefly imprisoned in Syria under the accusation of plotting to overthrow the Baathist ruling party in 1968 but escaped with the help of Wadie Haddad who with four others extracted Habash from a maximum security prison whilst disguised as military police. In the same year, he also came into conflict with long-time ally Wadie Haddad, but both remained in the PFLP.

At a 1969 congress, the PFLP re-designated itself a Marxist–Leninist movement and has remained a Communist organization ever since. Its pan-Arab leanings have been diminished since the ANM days, but popular support for a united Arab front has remained, especially in regard to Israeli and western political pressures. It holds a firm position regarding Israel, demanding its complete eradication as a racist state through military struggle and promotes a one-state solution (one secular, democratic, non-denominational state).

The 1969 congress also saw an ultra-leftist faction under Nayef Hawatmeh and Yasser Abd Rabbo split off as the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP), later to become the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). During Habash&#x27;s time as secretary-general, the PFLP became known as one of the most radical and militant Palestinian factions and gained world notoriety after a string of aircraft hijackings and attacks against Israel affiliated companies as well as Israeli ambassadors in Europe mostly planned by Haddad. The PFLP&#x27;s pioneering of modern international terror operations brought the group, and the Palestinian issue, onto newspaper front pages worldwide, but it also provoked intense criticism from other parts of the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 1970, Habash was evicted from Jordan due to the key role of the Popular Front in the Black September clashes. In 1974, the Palestinian National Council adopted a resolution recognizing a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Habash, who opposed this, formed the Rejectionist Front from several other opposition parties.

Habash aligned the PFLP with the PLO and the Lebanese National Movement, but stayed neutral during the Lebanese Civil War in the late 1970s. After a stroke in 1980, when he was living in Damascus, his health declined and other PFLP members rose to the top.

After the Oslo Agreements, Habash formed another opposition alliance of Rejectionists, including Islamist organizations such as Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, that became prominent during the First Intifada. In 2000, he resigned from his leadership post of the PFLP due to poor health and was succeeded by Abu Ali Mustafa. He continued to be an activist for the group until 2008 when he died of a heart attack in Amman.

==Black September==
The PFLP ignored tensions with the mainstream leadership of Yasser Arafat&#x27;s Fatah faction, and instead focused on bringing about revolutionary change in Jordan. Habash expressed the opinion that what proceeded was not &quot;only military but also psychological warfare&quot; and one had to &quot;hold the Israelis under permanent pressure&quot;.

In the 1970 Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings, Habash masterminded the hijackings of four Western airliners over the United States, Europe, the Far East and the Persian Gulf. The aircraft were forced to fly to a World War II airfield in Jordan, the passengers and crews were disembarked and the planes were then blown up.

The Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings were instrumental in provoking the Black September crackdown, which came close to destroying the PLO. The hijackings led Hussein of Jordan of Jordan to carry out a major offensive against militant strongholds in his kingdom resulting in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians. In autumn 1970, Habash visited Beijing. After Black September, the PLO fedayeen relocated to Lebanon.

In 1972, Habash experienced failing health and gradually began to lose influence within the organization. The Palestinian National Council&#x27;s (PNC) adoption of a resolution viewed by the PFLP as a two-state solution in 1974, prompted Habash to lead his organization out of active participation in the PLO and to join the Iraqi-backed Rejectionist Front. Only in 1977 would the PFLP opt to rejoin, as the Palestinian factions rallied their forces in opposition to Anwar Sadat&#x27;s overtures towards Israel, pro-U.S. policies and fragmentation of the Arab world. During the Lebanese Civil War that broke out in 1975, PFLP forces were decimated in the battle against Syria. Later, the PFLP would draw close to Syria, as Syria&#x27;s government shifted, but PFLP involvement in the Lebanese war remained strong until the US-negotiated evacuation of PLO units from Beirut in 1982 and continued on a smaller scale after that.

==Oslo Agreements==
After the signing of the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993, Habash and the PFLP again broke completely with Arafat, accusing him of selling out the Palestinian revolution. The group set up an anti-Arafat and anti-Oslo alliance in Damascus, for the first time joined by non-PLO Islamist groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which had grown to prominence during the First Intifada. After finding the position sterile, with Palestinian political dynamics playing out on the West Bank and Gaza areas of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Habash carefully sought to repair ties to Arafat, and gain a hold in post-Oslo politics without compromising PFLP principles. However, there is no indication that he ever accepted the two-state solution. This balancing act could not save the PFLP from being eclipsed by the militant Islamist factions on the one hand, and the resource-rich Fatah with its PNA patronage network on the other. The significance of the PFLP in Palestinian politics has diminished considerably since the mid-90s. The PFLP participated in the Palestinian legislative elections of 2006 as Ahmad Sa&#x27;adat won 4.2% of the popular vote.

In the late 1990s, Habash&#x27;s medical condition worsened. In 2000 he resigned from the post as secretary-general, citing health reasons. He was succeeded as head of the PFLP by Abu Ali Mustafa who was assassinated by Israel during the Second Intifada. Habash went on to set up a PFLP-affiliated research center, but he remained active in the PFLP&#x27;s internal politics. Until his death he was still popular among many Palestinians, who appreciate his revolutionary ideology, his determination and principles, the rejection of the Oslo Agreements and his intellectual style.

==Death==
Habash died on 26 January 2008, at the age of 81 of a heart attack in the Jordan Hospital, Amman, where Habash was a cancer patient. The President of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud Abbas called for three days of national mourning. Habash was buried in a suburban cemetery of Amman with the obsequies of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Abbas said Habash was a &quot;historic leader&quot; and called for Palestinian flags to be flown half-mast. Abdel Raheem Mallouh, PFLP deputy secretary-general, called Habash a &quot;distinguished leader... who struggled for more than 60 years without a stop for the rights and the interests of his people&quot;. Hamas leader and dismissed Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh sent his condolences, saying Habash &quot;spent his life defending Palestine&quot;.

<doc id="430429" wikidata="Q5609761" url="?curid=430429" title="Grizedale College, Lancaster">
<text>Grizedale College is a college of the University of Lancaster in Lancashire, England. The college is named after the Grizedale Forest area of &quot;Lancashire North of the Sands&quot;. When it was built it was situated at the southern extremity of the Bailrigg campus. The development of the south west campus has meant that college is now considered to be one of the more centrally located colleges. It is currently the fifth largest in terms of number of students.

==History==

Grizedale was one of the last colleges to be built on the Bailrigg campus in 1974. It initially shared accommodation and administration with Pendle College. Grizedale was in the old &#x27;E&#x27; Block and Pendle in the old &#x27;J&#x27; block. This arrangement continued until Grizedale took over &#x27;J Block&#x27; in 1993, and new accommodation to the south of Grizedale, originally intended for Grizedale itself, was completed for Pendle in 1994.

The Grizedale boar was only recently inaugurated as the college mascot. Originally, Depravo the rat, a character invented by Michael Palin in his book ‘Bert Fegg&#x27;s Nasty book for boys and girls’, represented the college. An early member of college staff was friendly with Mr Palin who granted the college the rights to the character and Depravo the Rat became Grizedale’s mascot. The boar became the second mascot in the late 1980s when a number of parents questioned the relevance of Depravo and the Grizedale boar was created. Since 2000 the boar has become the main mascot of the college, although the bar still retained the name &#x27;Depravos&#x27; until it was demolished in 2007.

==Redevelopment==
The original college accommodation &#x27;E&#x27; and &#x27;J&#x27; blocks were demolished in summer 2006. Problems with other building projects on campus meant that the site of the former buildings laid vacant for almost all of the 2006/07 academic year. As a result of these delays college students were housed in other buildings around campus including Pendle&#x27;s George Fox Building, Pendle Main, Graduate College and Bowland Tower. The new buildings were finally completed in time for Michaelmas term of the 2008/09 academic year. These new buildings are composed of 12 person townhouses and 6 person apartments as opposed to the corridor block arrangements of the original accommodation.

Depravo&#x27;s, along with the college&#x27;s offices and porters&#x27; lodge, was demolished after the graduation party for the 2007 graduates in July 2007. It was rebuilt and reopened at the start of the 2009 academic year, and stripped of its former name and mascot, renamed simply &#x27;Grizedale Café Bar&#x27;.

==Facilities==
The college houses a recently renovated bar, junior and senior common rooms and accommodation blocks and a laundrette.

Central to the college has always been the college bar, originally known as &#x27;The World&#x27;s End&#x27; as Grizedale was the southernmost college on campus and later as &#x27;Depravos&#x27;. This was home to a number of famous campus events, including the &#x27;Shite&#x27; Disco, the gZ Centurion and many others, getting Grizedale the reputation as the Social College. The college bar was redeveloped and reopened in 2009. The original, iconic mural that had adorned the old bar&#x27;s staircase was relocated to the University Chaplaincy Centre, and was replaced with photos taken in Grizedale Forest by former college principal Andrew Okey.

==Symbols==
The official college song, adopted as the result of a vote by the JCR membership, is &quot;Never Forget&quot; as performed by &quot;Take That&quot;. The college has two mascots - &quot;Depravo&quot; the rat, the rights to which were granted to the college by Michael Palin and, since 2000, the &quot;Grizedale Boar&quot;.

==Social Events==
Grizedale college has a reputation for being a sociable college, attracting students from other colleges in the evening for events often held at Grizedale Bar. Events are organised by the JCR - Events such as Take Me Out, Quizzes and Extrav; as well as many socials throughout the university hosting events at the bar. Currently, there is a permanent 2-for-1 all-day everyday cocktail menu, including Sex on the Beach, Long Island Iced Tea, Cosmopolitan, White Russian, Lynchburg Lemonade, Woo Woo and Blue Lagoon, which costs £6.95 for two of any type. However, through the week there are also different cocktail offers depending on the day of the week. Mondays have gin offers, Tuesdays are hardshakes including a range of milkshake cocktails, Wednesday is Captain Gilligan’s Rumshack, Thursdays are martinis, Fridays are prosecco cocktails and Saturdays are sours. In terms of food, currently, the bar sells a range of different types of nachos, such as cheesy, barbeque, Mexican vegetarian and have begun selling Frenchos, which includes pita bread, cranberry sauce and camembert.

At present, the bar is open for service from 4 pm until close, depending on how busy the bar is, from Monday-Saturday, being closed on Sundays/ However, students can enter the bar in mornings to play pool or darts and use the tables.

== Governance ==
Grizedale, like many of her sister colleges, has found redevelopment and inconsistent Presidencies a major cause for concern. In 2009 reform was passed through the student union to allow the vice-president to sit alongside the President in Union Council, the senior student council.

All presidents sit on both Senate and Court, only two of the nine college vice-presidents who are elected as Senate representatives through Academic Council, may also hold full seats on both Senate and Court. This role is completely autonomous from their college role and as such may mandate their presidents should a vote be requested on court matters.

All members of the executive sit on student union sub-committees including: President&#x27;s Committee Vice-President&#x27;s Committee both sit on UnionCouncil, Extrav Sub etc. Academic Council Chair Committee/Elections Sub-committee Wel-Comm Inter College Sport i.e. George Wyatt

Grizedale College has proven itself to be a powerful college in the transition of JCR executive presidents to the student union, with Chris Cottam, Graeme Poulton and Dwayne Branch all successfully running for office. In the summer term of 2009 former social secretary Victoria (Torri) Crapper was elected vice president for welfare in the new LUSU Sabbatical make-up. In 2010 former president Chaz Ginn and former VP Paul Lynch were candidates for the welfare and academic vice-presidencies, but both lost in close elections. Grizedale prides itself on the activism of its members, with the former bar depicting the storming of University House in an elaborate mural that lined the stairs to the JCR space, based on a World War II photograph. It is expected that once restored to its former glory, the college will once again be one of the most politically vocal on the Campus.

==Sport==

The Inter-College Carter Shield has been won on two occasions, in 2005 and 2009. With many of the college JCR members representing their both University and College teams, with the support of the SCR, the first Grizedale College Colours for sport were awarded at the Christmas Ball of 2006 and the tradition has carried on, with the Sports Reps choosing a suitable candidate for both Colours for Excellence and Extraordinary Commitment.

In addition to the Colours the Victoria Stockton memorial cup is awarded to a student displaying the most commitment to college sport. The cup was presented by Victoria&#x27;s parents to Fr. Hugh Pollock in memory of their daughter who was the first sports representative in the college to win the coveted Carter Shield; and who died in the summer of 2006. The recipients are nominated by the Sports Reps before being approved by College Council.

A number of former College Colours recipients have gone on to receive university full colours and an England shirt belonging to rugby league player Tom Lever is on display alongside the former president&#x27;s board in the Porter&#x27;s Lodge of the college.

In 2018 the first Grizedale College member won the sportswoman of the year award. Moreover, Grizedale’s football and netball teams are some of the best in the university, with alumnus Rory Marrow leading the college to an unbeaten league triumph in 2019.

<text>Nicole Brown Simpson (née Brown; May 19, 1959 – June 12, 1994) was the second wife of American professional football player, actor, and media personality O. J. Simpson. She was murdered outside her Brentwood home, along with her friend Ron Goldman, in 1994.

Brown and Simpson met in 1977 and married in 1985, five years after Simpson had retired from professional American football. Their marriage lasted for eight years, and they had a daughter and a son together. Reports suggest that Simpson emotionally, verbally, and physically abused Brown throughout their relationship, which continued after their divorce. They made an attempt at reconciliation, but later broke up again, seemingly permanently, in May 1994.

In June 1994, Brown and Goldman were stabbed to death, and Simpson was tried for the murders. Following a highly publicized criminal trial, Simpson was acquitted of all charges, though he was later found liable for the wrongful deaths in a civil lawsuit in 1997. No other suspects have ever been identified, and the killings remain unsolved, although Brown&#x27;s family has expressed the belief that Simpson committed the murders and was the sole perpetrator.

==Early life==
Nicole Brown was born on May 19, 1959, in Frankfurt, West Germany, to Juditha Anne &quot;Judy&quot; Brown (née Baur) and Louis Hezekiah &quot;Lou&quot; Brown Jr. Her mother was German, and her father American. Lou Brown served in World War II as a pilot and married in Switzerland after the war. Nicole was the second of four daughters (the others being Denise, Dominique, and Tanya). From her father&#x27;s previous marriage, she had two older half-sisters (Wendy and Margit) and one older half-brother (Tracy). After moving to the United States, she attended Rancho Alamitos High School in Garden Grove, California. She graduated from Dana Hills High School, in Dana Point, California, in 1976. She was raised Catholic.

In Brown&#x27;s 1976 senior yearbook from Dana Hills High School, her nickname is &quot;nick&quot; and her quote is that she: &quot;remembers Jr. Sr. prom, kissing a pumpkin at the homecoming dance &#x27;74, one of the semi-finalists for Homecoming, plans to ski Europe, go to Brooks photo school, get Scott, &#x27;Be yourself, don&#x27;t be phony, you don&#x27;t have to do anything.&#x27;&quot; Brown&#x27;s mention of &quot;Brooks photo school&quot; was referring to The Brooks Institute of Photography that operated from 1945 to 2016 in the Santa Barbara, California area, a two-hour drive from her high school.

==Relationship with O. J. Simpson==
===Early relationship ===
Brown met American professional football player, actor, and media personality O. J. Simpson in 1977, when he was 30 and she was 18. At the time, she was waitressing at The Daisy, a nightclub in Beverly Hills, California. They began dating while Simpson was still married to his first wife, Marguerite Whitley, who was then pregnant with their daughter Aaren. Simpson and Whitley divorced in March 1979. &quot;Before we had separated in 1977, Nicole would drive by the house or check to see if his car was there,&quot; Marguerite later said in an interview with Barbara Walters in 1995. &quot;She would call many times and say that she was Cathy Randa, who&#x27;s O.J.&#x27;s secretary. So I knew who she was. I didn&#x27;t actually know her personally.&quot; 

In the June 3, 2024 issue of &quot;People&quot;, Brown&#x27;s older sister Denise revealed that Simpson was occasionally hostile towards Nicole even during the early days of their relationship, including on one occasion in 1977 after she and her family had gone to upstate New York to attend a Buffalo Bills game that Simpson was playing in. According to Denise, he &quot;flipped out&quot; during this occasion, after seeing Nicole kiss a mutual male friend on the cheek and &quot;had her in the upstairs bathroom crying. He said, &#x27;You embarrassed me.&#x27;&quot;

Brown had a non-speaking acting part as &quot;Passenger on Bus&quot; in the 1980 TV film &quot;Detour to Terror&quot;, starring Simpson who executive produced the film. During the 1984 Summer Olympics torch relay, Simpson carried the torch on Santa Monica&#x27;s California Incline road, running behind Brown. Simpson was among the many celebrities who attended the premiere of the Michael Jackson short film &quot;Captain EO&quot; in 1986, which Brown also attended.

===Marriage===

Brown and Simpson married on February 2, 1985, five years after his retirement from professional football. The couple had two children, Sydney Brooke Simpson (b. 1985) and Justin Ryan Simpson (b. 1988), both delivered via caesarian section. The marriage lasted seven years. According to Denise Brown, Nicole considered motherhood to be her crowning achievement, though Simpson became more volatile towards her after the children were born.

According to Sheila Weller, &quot;[Simpson and Brown] were a dramatic, fractious, mutually obsessed couple before they married, after they married, after they divorced in 1992, and after they reconciled.&quot;

==== Domestic violence ====
According to multiple accounts, Simpson emotionally, verbally, and physically abused Brown throughout their relationship, and the abuse continued after their divorce. According to Brown&#x27;s sister Dominique, Simpson referred to his wife as a &quot;fat pig&quot; during a pregnancy. Family friend Robin Greer stated that Simpson had refused to have sex with Brown in the months after her pregnancy because of its effect on her weight. Greer also claimed that he had Brown followed numerous times, and would &quot;plant&quot; people in the clubs she and Brown went out to at night to report their activities back to Simpson.

Accounts from Brown&#x27;s diary date physical abuse as far back as 1978. She called the police on Simpson numerous times over the course of their marriage, but most of the calls were not met with serious response by the LAPD because of Simpson&#x27;s celebrity status. The first police report was filed after an incident on New Year&#x27;s Day 1989. On December 31, Brown had phoned the police, saying that she thought Simpson was going to kill her. She was found by the responding officer hiding in the bushes outside their home, &quot;badly beaten and half-naked&quot;. Authorities said Simpson had &quot;punched, slapped, and kicked&quot; her. When the reponding officer announced his intent to arrest Simpson, he sped away from the cops in his car. Eventually, he pleaded no contest to spousal abuse. Brown dropped the charges after her parents allegedly encouraged her to reconcile with Simpson, who was enabling her father, Louis, to invest in a lucrative Hertz car rental facility at The Ritz Carlton at Monarch Bay, California, which significantly benefited the Brown family financially.

In addition to the physical abuse, Simpson was also reported to have been an avid womanizer who engaged in numerous infidelities while married to Brown. In the 2016 documentary &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot;, Robin Greer said that the couple were constantly fighting over Simpson&#x27;s affairs with other women. Greer even noted how Simpson had made repeated advances towards her as well. The police report from the New Years Day incident indicated that Simpson had said: &quot;I don&#x27;t want that woman [Brown] sleeping in my bed anymore! I got two women, and I don&#x27;t want that woman in my bed anymore.&quot; At the time of their separation, he informed Brown of his ongoing one-year extramarital affair with Tawny Kitaen. The affair was revealed at Simpson&#x27;s 1997 civil trial for wrongful death.

A family friend claimed that Simpson had told Brown&#x27;s friends that if he ever &quot;caught her with anyone, he would kill her&quot;. Brown&#x27;s friend Kris Jenner claimed that Brown had at one point told her, &quot;Things are really bad between O.J. and I, and he&#x27;s going to kill me, and he&#x27;s going to get away with it.&quot; The two broke up again, seemingly permanently, in May 1994. In total, prosecutors for Simpson&#x27;s murder trial found 62 incidents of abusive behavior by Simpson towards Brown. News reporting regarding these incidents led to California enforcing its 1986 laws to better protect domestic violence victims. Hertz continued airing its commercials featuring Simpson until they cut all ties with him amid the murder trial.

==== Divorce ====
In January 1992, Brown moved into a rental home in Brentwood, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. The property was a four-bedroom, Tudor-style house with 3,400 square feet on Gretna Green Way, where she lived for two years.

Simpson filed for divorce on February 25, 1992, citing irreconcilable differences. They then shared custody of their two children.

==== Ongoing relationship and abuse ====
Reports suggest that in 1993, after the divorce, Brown and Simpson made an attempt at reconciliation. During this time Simpson continued his abuse of Brown. She told her mother after the divorce that Simpson was following her and stated, &quot;I go to the gas station, he&#x27;s there. I go to the Payless shoe store, and he&#x27;s there. I&#x27;m driving, and he&#x27;s behind me.&#x27;&quot;

On October 25, 1993, Brown called the police to report Simpson being violent again, after he had allegedly found a photo of a man Brown had dated while they were broken up. Brown called 911, crying and saying that Simpson was &quot;going to beat the shit out of me&quot;. Simpson angrily shouted in the background, &quot;You didn&#x27;t give a shit about the kids when you were [having sex with him] in the living room! They were here! Didn&#x27;t care about the kids then!&quot; He also expressed frustration regarding Brown surrounding herself with and exposing her children to frequent drug users, prostitutes and drug dealers. Several times, Simpson expressed disappointment in the dangerous choices Brown had made and concern for his children. He repeatedly said, &quot;I&#x27;m leaving with my two fucking kids is when I&#x27;m leaving.&quot;

When the police arrived, Brown was secretly recorded by Sgt. Craig Lally. &quot;He gets a very animalistic look in him,&quot; Brown stated. &quot;All his veins pop out, his eyes are black and just black, I mean cold, like an animal. I mean very, very weird. And when I see it, it just scares me.&quot; Brown also stated that Simpson had not hit her in four years, referring to the January 1, 1989 incident as the last time he had become physical with her.

Brown moved out of their shared home several months after this incident, and the relationship ended.

==Post-divorce life==
Brown met and became friends with Kato Kaelin on a skiing trip in Aspen, Colorado, in December 1992. He later moved into the guest house on Brown&#x27;s property on Gretna Green Way and lived there for a year. Kaelin paid rent and helped take care of Sydney and Justin as part of the living arrangement. Brown also entertained other suitors, including restaurateur Keith Zlomsowitch and Marcus Allen. Despite speculation of her having been a recreational drug user during this time, there is no solid evidence of Brown using drugs; she had no drugs in her system at the time of her death and her house was clear of drug paraphernalia.

Brown and Faye Resnick first met in 1990. According to Robert Kardashian, Resnick only knew Brown for a year and a half. The two socialized in and around Brentwood, Los Angeles and vacationed in Mexico together. Resnick&#x27;s third husband, Paul, reported that a concerned Brown called him in early June 1994 to report that &quot;Faye was getting out of control&quot; and abusing cocaine again. Resnick stayed for several days at Brown&#x27;s condominium until on June 9, 1994, Brown and several other friends conducted an intervention and persuaded Resnick to check into the Exodus Recovery Center in Marina Del Rey, California.

In January 1994, Brown moved just a few minutes away from her home on Gretna Green Way to a three-story, rental townhouse on Bundy Drive in Brentwood. It was a Mediterranean-style residence that was 3,400 square feet with multiple patios and a &quot;rooftop sundeck&quot;. In Brown&#x27;s Brentwood neighborhood, situated near the base of the Santa Monica Mountains and four miles from the ocean, there were country clubs, local and state parks, hiking trails, and popular attractions like the Santa Monica Pier. At the time, she drove a Ferrari, which she later lent to Ron Goldman whom she had met some six weeks prior to their deaths. The upscale area had shops, restaurants, and grocery markets near her home. Brown&#x27;s sister Denise described this period in a 1994 interview, saying that Nicole &quot;was just so vivacious, so full of life&quot; and &quot;I was so happy for her. For the first time in her life, she was able to have her own friends. We were talking about going to Yosemite, camping, taking the kids to Club Med. Everything was going to revolve around the kids.&quot;

==Death==
===Final days===

On March 16, 1994, Brown and her children attended the premiere for Simpson&#x27;s newest film, &quot;Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult&quot;. Brown initiated a reconciliation attempt in 1993, sending Simpson a video of their wedding and a letter begging him to take her back and stating that she wanted to put their family back together. According to Brown’s sister Tanya, Nicole told their mother Juditha on the night she was murdered while they were eating dinner at the Mezzaluna restaurant that Simpson would always be her soul mate. 

Brown met 25-year-old restaurant waiter Ron Goldman six weeks prior to their deaths. According to police and friends, they had a platonic relationship, occasionally meeting for coffee and dinner. Goldman borrowed her Ferrari when he met a friend for lunch. The friend, Craig Clark, stated that Goldman told him it was his friend Nicole&#x27;s car.

Brown developed pneumonia in May and Simpson came to her house to care for her. Simpson left for Palm Springs Memorial Day weekend 1994. Just one day before the murders, Brown and her close friend Kris Jenner spoke on the phone, making plans to go to lunch the next day. Kris said in an interview that Nicole wanted to confide in her about something &quot;very important&quot; and possibly reveal information about her &quot;volatile&quot; relationship with Simpson, but Brown was murdered before they could meet.

===June 12, 1994===

At the time of her death, Brown resided at 875 South Bundy Drive in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, with her two children. On the evening of June 12, Brown took Sydney and a friend out to dinner after the children&#x27;s dance recital. The defense team would cite that Brown had an intense argument on the phone, overheard by eight-year-old Sydney upstairs, and that a witness named Tom Lang saw Brown arguing with two men in the area of the sidewalk near the front of her house shortly after 10:00 that night. Brown&#x27;s mother, Juditha, told police and investigators in a sworn statement that she was speaking with her daughter on the telephone at 11:00pm that night. Those phone records were sealed. 

Brown and Goldman were stabbed to death outside her home; their bodies were found shortly after midnight. Brown was lying in the fetal position in a pool of blood. An autopsy determined that she had been stabbed seven times in the neck and scalp and had sustained a 14 cm-long (5.5 inches) gash across her throat, which had severed both her left and right carotid arteries and breached her right and left jugular veins. The wound on Brown&#x27;s neck penetrated 1.9 cm (0.75 inches) into her cervical vertebrae, nearly decapitating her. She also had defensive wounds on her hands.

During a reconstruction of events, the police theorized that Brown and Goldman were talking on the front patio of Brown&#x27;s condominium when they were attacked or that Goldman arrived while Brown was being attacked; in any case, the police believe that Brown was the intended target and that Goldman was killed in order to silence him. Witness Robert Heidstra testified that while walking near Brown&#x27;s condominium that night, he heard a man yelling, &quot;Hey! Hey! Hey!&quot; who was then shouted at by a second man. He also heard a gate slam. Goldman&#x27;s family came to believe that Goldman was the man shouting &quot;Hey!&quot; and that he may have attempted to save Brown by intervening in the attack.

Brown&#x27;s funeral was held on June 16 at the St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church in Brentwood, with mourners including Simpson and their two children, members of Brown&#x27;s family, Al Cowlings, Kato Kaelin, and Steve Garvey. Brown is buried in Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest, California.

==Trials==
===Criminal trial===
After leading police on a low-speed chase in a now infamous white Ford Bronco, Simpson was tried for the murders of Brown and Goldman. The trial spanned eight months, from January 24 to October 3, 1995, and received international publicity and exacerbated racial divisions in the U.S. During the trial, there was some speculation as to whether Brown and Goldman were secretly dating, compounded by three facts, that Brown was wearing a slinky, revealing cocktail dress when she was found dead, candles were lit in the master bedroom and bathroom, and the master bathroom’s tub was full of water.

Though prosecutors argued that Simpson was implicated by a significant amount of forensic evidence, he was acquitted of both murders on October 3. Commentators agree that to convince the jury to acquit Simpson, the defense capitalized on anger among the city&#x27;s African-American community toward the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which had a history of racial bias and had inflamed racial tensions in the beating of Rodney King and subsequent riots two years prior. The trial is often characterized as the trial of the century because of its international publicity and has been described as the &quot;most publicized&quot; criminal trial in history. Simpson was formally charged with the murders on June 17; when he did not turn himself in at the agreed time, he became the subject of a police pursuit. TV stations interrupted coverage of the 1994 NBA Finals to broadcast live coverage of the pursuit, which was watched by around 95 million people. The pursuit and Simpson&#x27;s arrest were among the most widely publicized events in history.

Simpson was represented by a high-profile defense team, referred to as the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, initially led by Robert Shapiro and subsequently directed by Johnnie Cochran. The team included F. Lee Bailey, Alan Dershowitz, Robert Kardashian, Shawn Holley, Carl E. Douglas, and Gerald Uelmen. Simpson was also instrumental in his own defense. While Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark, William Hodgman, and Christopher Darden believed they had a strong case, the defense team persuaded the jury there was reasonable doubt concerning the DNA evidence. They contended the blood sample had been mishandled by lab scientists and that the case had been tainted by LAPD misconduct related to racism and incompetence. The use of DNA evidence in trials was relatively new, and many laypersons did not understand how to evaluate it. The defense retained renowned advocate for victims of domestic abuse Lenore E. Walker. Cochran said that she would testify that Simpson does not fit the profile of an abuser that would murder his spouse; &quot;He has good control over his impulses. He appears to control his emotions well.&quot; Brown&#x27;s friend, Cora Fischman, testified that Brown never said anything to her about being abused by Simpson during the months leading up to the murders.

The trial was considered significant for the wide division in reaction to the verdict. Observers&#x27; opinions of the verdict were largely related to their ethnicity; the media dubbed this the &quot;racial gap&quot;. A poll of Los Angeles County residents showed most African Americans thought the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict was justified while most whites thought it was a racially motivated jury nullification by the mostly African-American jury. Polling in later years showed the gap had narrowed since the trial; more than half of polled Black respondents expressed the belief that Simpson was guilty. In 2017, three jurors who acquitted Simpson said they would still vote to acquit, while one said he would convict.

In the 1996 book &quot;Killing Time: The First Full Investigation into the Unsolved Murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman&quot;, authors Donald Freed and Raymond P. Briggs wrote that lipstick was found on Goldman&#x27;s cheek after his death, and suggested that Brown kissed Goldman when he arrived and that they were together on the front porch when they were attacked.

===Civil trial===
In 1996, Fred Goldman and Sharon Rufo (Ron Goldman&#x27;s parents) and Lou Brown (Nicole Brown&#x27;s father) filed a civil suit against Simpson for wrongful death. Presiding Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki did not allow the trial to be televised, did not sequester the jury, and prohibited the defense from alleging racism by the LAPD and from condemning the crime lab. There was no change to the physical evidence, but additional evidence of domestic violence was presented, as well as 31 pre-1994 photos of Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes, including one that was published six months before the murders, proving it could not be a forgery.

One significant difference between the two trials was the admission of Brown&#x27;s diary entries in the civil case. Lead counsel Daniel Petrocelli explained, &quot;The least explored aspect of the case is Simpson&#x27;s motive. You cannot just say this murder was a culmination of domestic-violence incidents. You need to tell the jury a story. This was about a stormy relationship.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported, &quot;That strategy made the difference in understanding Simpson... Nicole&#x27;s diary showed that she and Simpson were having fights in those last weeks. Their hostilities had taken a cruel turn. Simpson sent Nicole a letter that was a thinly veiled threat to report her to the IRS for failing to pay capital-gains taxes. Infuriated, she started to deny him access to the children... She began to treat him like a stranger. That, Petrocelli said, is when three weeks of retaliation began. In that period, the lawyer argued, Simpson grew angrier and more obsessed with his ex-wife, developing a rage that resulted in death for her and Ron Goldman.&quot;

The civil judge found the diary entries admissible because they were pertinent to Nicole&#x27;s state of mind, which in turn was relevant to Simpson&#x27;s motive—reversing a crucial ruling from the criminal case that excluded the diary as &quot;inadmissible hearsay&quot;. The civil court&#x27;s ruling was upheld on appeal. The jury found Simpson liable for the murders and awarded the victims&#x27; families $33.5 million in compensation and punitive damages. Simpson filed for bankruptcy afterwards and relocated to Florida to protect his pension from seizure. His remaining assets were seized and auctioned off, most being purchased by critics of the criminal trial verdict to help the plaintiffs recoup the costs of litigation. Simpson&#x27;s Heisman Trophy was sold for $255,500 to an undisclosed buyer. All the proceeds went to the Goldman family, who said they have received only one percent of the money that Simpson owes from the wrongful death suit.

Following Simpson&#x27;s acquittal, no additional arrests or convictions related to the murders were made. Simpson maintained his innocence in subsequent media interviews. He was subsequently jailed for an unrelated armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel in 2008. Following Simpson&#x27;s death in 2024, his estate lawyer Malcolm LeVergne pledged to prevent the Brown and Goldman families from obtaining the money promised in the civil trial judgement, but later reversed course.

===Custody of children===
In 1996, after the conclusion of the criminal trial, a judge granted Simpson&#x27;s petition to give him full custody of Sydney and Justin. Brown&#x27;s parents continued unsuccessfully to fight for custody until 2006, when Justin turned 18 and legally became an adult. Sydney turned 18 in 2003.

=== Alternate theories and suspects ===
While defense attorney F. Lee Bailey and several members of Simpson&#x27;s family still advocated for Simpson&#x27;s innocence, such theories have been rejected by prosecutors, witnesses, and the families of Brown and Goldman, who have expressed the belief that Simpson committed the murders and was the sole perpetrator. Alternative theories have been suggested, such as that Simpson may have had accomplices in the murders, or that he was not involved at all and was framed. Several speculate that the murders were related to the Los Angeles drug trade and the murders of Michael Nigg and Brett Cantor.

The 2000 BBC TV documentary, &quot;O.J.: The True Untold Story&quot;, primarily rehashes the contamination and blood planting claims from the trial and asserted that Simpson&#x27;s elder son Jason is a possible suspect, due to—among other reasons—Simpson hiring defense attorneys for his children first before himself, pictures of Jason&#x27;s descriptive wool cap, and an alleged prior arrangement to meet with Brown that evening. William Dear published his findings in the book &quot;O.J. Is Innocent and I Can Prove It&quot;.

A 2012 documentary entitled &quot;My Brother the Serial Killer&quot; examined the crimes of convicted murderer Glen Edward Rogers and included claims that Rogers had killed Brown and Goldman in California in 1994. According to Rogers&#x27;s brother Clay, Rogers claimed that before the murders, he had met Brown and was &quot;going to take her down.&quot; During a lengthy correspondence that began in 2009 between Rogers and criminal profiler Anthony Meoli, Rogers wrote and created paintings about his involvement with the murders. During a prison meeting between the two, Rogers claimed Simpson hired him to break into Brown&#x27;s house and steal some expensive jewelry. He said that Simpson had told him, &quot;You may have to kill the bitch&quot;. In a filmed interview, Rogers&#x27;s brother Clay asserts that his brother confessed his involvement. Rogers&#x27;s family stated that he had informed them that he had been working for Brown in 1994 and that he had made verbal threats about her to them. Rogers later spoke to a criminal profiler about the murders, providing details about the crime and remarking that he had been hired by Simpson to steal a pair of earrings and potentially murder Brown. LAPD responded to the documentary as follows, &quot;We know who killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. We have no reason to believe that Mr. Rogers was involved.&quot; Fred Goldman, father of Ron Goldman stated, &quot;The overwhelming evidence at the criminal trial proved that one, and only one, person murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. That person is O.J. Simpson and not Glen Rogers.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Foundation===
The Nicole Brown Simpson Foundation was established in 1994 in Brown&#x27;s memory. Later renamed the Nicole Brown Charitable Foundation, it reportedly cut back on grantmaking in 1999 due to a drop in donations and questionable management practices.

===Tributes===
In a rare 1996 VHS video by her parents called &quot;A Tribute to Nicole&quot;, Brown is described as having had a &quot;happy childhood&quot; growing up in a &quot;close family&quot; and as &quot;lov[ing] interior decorating.&quot; Clips from the family&#x27;s home movies show her as a young girl playing with stuffed animals, swimming in a pool, dancing, carrying school books, and blowing out birthday candles on cupcakes. She was characterized by her mother as &quot;warm&quot;, &quot;wonderful&quot;, and &quot;free-spirited&quot;.

Kato Kaelin described Brown in a 2024 interview as a &quot;beautiful&quot; friend who was a &quot;beacon of light, always bright, always fun&quot;. Kris Jenner said Brown was &quot;one of [her] best friends&quot; with whom she often took family vacations. Jenner also shared memories of a Los Angeles restaurant she used to frequent with Brown and their mutual friend, Faye Resnick.

Brown&#x27;s sister, Tanya Brown, said in a 2019 interview that &quot;Nicole was a mom: she put her kids first, she put everybody else first. My sister had the ability to live life, live it bright, live it large.&quot; That same year, Tanya wrote an article claiming that she had forgiven Simpson, despite believing him responsible for her sister&#x27;s murder.

Kris Jenner named her fourth daughter, Kendall Nicole Jenner, after Brown. Kendall was born 17 months after Brown&#x27;s death.

When filmmaker Ezra Edelman, director of the documentary &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, he dedicated the award to both Brown and Goldman in his acceptance speech.

===Death of parents===
On July 3, 2014, Brown&#x27;s father, Louis Hezekiah &quot;Lou&quot; Brown Jr., died aged 90. He was interred next to Nicole in Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest, California. Nicole&#x27;s headstone had space for an additional inscription, so it was altered to include her father.

On November 8, 2020, Brown&#x27;s mother, Juditha Anne &quot;Judi&quot; Baur Brown, died aged 89. She was interred in Ascension Cemetery next to her husband and daughter. Nicole&#x27;s original headstone was replaced by a larger one that included the inscriptions for both of her parents on it.

===Property===
Two years after the deaths of Brown and Goldman, the townhouse at 875 South Bundy Drive was extensively remodeled by a new owner, who also had the address changed.

==Media==
===Book===
Simpson wrote a book titled &quot;If I Did It&quot;, which is a first-person account of how he would have carried out the murders if he had committed them. In Simpson&#x27;s hypothetical scenario, he has an unwilling accomplice named &quot;Charlie&quot; who urges him to not engage with Brown, whom Simpson plans to &quot;scare the shit out of&quot;. Simpson ignores Charlie&#x27;s advice and continues to Brown&#x27;s condo, where he finds and confronts Ron Goldman. According to the book, Brown falls and hits her head on the concrete, and Goldman crouches in a karate pose. As the confrontation escalates, Simpson writes, &quot;Then something went horribly wrong, and I know &quot;what&quot; happened, but I can&#x27;t tell you &quot;how&quot;.&quot; He writes that he regained consciousness later with no memory of the actual act of murder.

Simpson&#x27;s eldest daughter, Arnelle Simpson, testified in a deposition that she and Van Exel, president of Raffles Entertainment and Music Production, came up with the idea for the book and pitched it to her father in an attempt to make money. She testified that her father thought about it and eventually agreed to the book deal. Simpson stated, &quot;I have nothing to confess. This was an opportunity for my kids to get their financial legacy. My kids understand. I made it clear that it&#x27;s blood money, but it&#x27;s no different than any of the other writers who did books on this case.&quot;

According to court documents, in August 2007, as part of the multi-million dollar civil jury award against Simpson to ensure he could not profit from the book, the Goldman family were granted the proceeds from the book. The Goldman family still own the copyright, media rights, and movie rights, and they have acquired Simpson&#x27;s name, likeness, life story, and right of publicity in connection with the book. After changing the title to &quot;If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer&quot;, the Goldman family had the book published in September 2007 through Beaufort Books. Denise Brown, Nicole Brown&#x27;s sister, criticized the Goldmans for publishing the book and accused them of profiting from Brown and Goldman&#x27;s deaths.

===Portrayals===
Brown was portrayed by Jessica Tuck in the 1995 television movie &quot;The O. J. Simpson Story&quot;; by Kelly Dowdle in the 2016 Netflix series &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot;; by Mena Suvari in the 2019 film &quot;The Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson&quot;; and by Charlotte Kirk in the upcoming 2025 film &quot;The Juice&quot;.

===Podcast===
The podcast &quot;You&#x27;re Wrong About&quot; did multiple episodes covering Brown’s life and her relationship with Simpson, with the intention of drawing attention to the abuse that she experienced, as well as the events leading up to her murder and the trial.

===Documentary===
Upon Simpson&#x27;s death in 2024, Lifetime announced that a two-part documentary about Brown was in development, titled &quot;The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson&quot;, which aired on June 1 and 2, 2024.

<text>An electronic document is a document that can be sent in non-physical means, such as telex, email, and the internet. Originally, any computer data were considered as something internal—the final data output was always on paper. However, the development of computer networks has made it so that in most cases it is much more convenient to distribute electronic documents than printed ones. The improvements in electronic visual display technologies made it possible to view documents on a screen instead of printing them (thus saving paper and the space required to store the printed copies).
However, using electronic documents for the final presentation instead of paper has created the problem of multiple incompatible file formats. Even plain text computer files are not free from this problem—e.g. under MS-DOS, most programs could not work correctly with UNIX-style text files (see newline), and for non-English speakers, the different code pages always have been a source of trouble.

Even more problems are connected with complex file formats of various word processors, spreadsheets, and graphics software. To alleviate the problem, many software companies distribute free file viewers for their proprietary file formats (one example is Adobe&#x27;s Acrobat Reader). The other solution is the development of standardized non-proprietary file formats (such as HTML and OpenDocument), and electronic documents for specialized uses have specialized formats—the specialized electronic articles in physics use TeX or PostScript.

<doc id="430438" wikidata="Q281518" url="?curid=430438" title="Ron Goldman">
<text>Ronald Lyle Goldman (July 2, 1968 – June 12, 1994) was an American restaurant waiter and aspiring actor. A volunteer working with children suffering from cerebral palsy, Goldman appeared as a contestant on the short-lived game show &quot;Studs&quot; in early 1992. Goldman lived independently from his family and supported himself as an employment headhunter, tennis instructor, and waiter, and worked occasionally as a model. Not long before his death, Goldman earned an emergency medical technician license, but he decided not to pursue that as a career.

In 1994, Goldman became a friend of Nicole Brown Simpson, the ex-wife of American football player O. J. Simpson. In June 1994, Goldman was murdered, along with Brown, outside her home in Brentwood, Los Angeles. Following a controversial and highly publicized criminal trial, Simpson was acquitted of all charges, though he was later found liable for their deaths in a 1997 civil lawsuit filed by Goldman&#x27;s father Fred. No other suspects have ever been identified, and the killings remain unsolved, although Goldman&#x27;s family have expressed the belief that Simpson committed the murders and was the sole perpetrator.

==Early life==

Goldman was born on July 2, 1968. He grew up in the community of Buffalo Grove, Illinois. After his parents divorced in 1974 and after spending a brief time in the custody of his mother, Sharon Rufo (née Fohrman), he was raised by his father, Frederic Goldman (born December 6, 1940). Goldman lived with his father and his younger sister, Kimberly. Goldman was raised Jewish. 

Goldman attended high school at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois. He was a student at Illinois State University for one semester, where he planned to major in psychology, and he also had an interest in becoming a pledge in Sigma Nu fraternity. After his family relocated to Southern California when he was 18 years old, however, Goldman discontinued his studies and followed his family.

Prior to relocating with his family, Goldman worked as a camp counselor and had experience volunteering with children who suffered from cerebral palsy.

==In California==
While living in Los Angeles, Goldman took some classes at Pierce College. He learned to surf and enjoyed playing beach volleyball, rollerblading, and nightclubbing.

Upon arriving in California, Goldman lived independently from his family and supported himself as an employment headhunter, tennis instructor, and waiter. He worked occasionally as a model for Barry Zeldes, owner of the Z90049 store in Brentwood Gardens.

Instead, Goldman told friends that he wanted to open a bar or restaurant in the Brentwood area. He planned for the venue to be known not by a name but by the ankh, an Egyptian religious symbol of life that he had tattooed on his shoulder. According to his friend Jeff Keller, he wanted to learn all facets of the restaurant-bar business and occasionally worked as a promoter at a Century City dance club called Tripps. He had also tended a bar called &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, which co-incidentally was owned by Brett Cantor. For Memorial Day, he participated with a group of event promoters in organizing a party at Renaissance, a club and restaurant on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica.

Goldman also expressed aspirations to act; he appeared on an episode of the dating game show &quot;Studs&quot; (hosted by Mark DeCarlo) in early 1992.

==Death==
===Final days===
According to a June 15, 1994, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article published three days after his death, Goldman met Brown only six weeks prior to the date they were murdered, when he borrowed her Ferrari. The two were seen together in clubs, occasionally meeting for coffee and dinner in the weeks before their deaths. According to police and friends, however, the relationship between the two was platonic. One article noted that he had borrowed her car when he met his friend, Craig Clark, for lunch. According to Clark, Goldman told him it was Brown&#x27;s car, but he did not say she was his girlfriend. Instead, Goldman said they were friends.

He dated Jacqui Bell for nearly two years before she broke off their relationship three months before his death. Not long before his death, Goldman earned an emergency medical technician license, but he decided not to pursue that as a career.

===June 12, 1994===
On the evening of Sunday, June 12, 1994, Goldman worked a server shift at Mezzaluna Trattoria in Brentwood. Brown called to report that her mother had inadvertently dropped her reading glasses outside by the gutter when they dined there earlier in the evening. Goldman had not been their server, but after a search at the restaurant turned up the glasses, Goldman agreed, at Brown’s request, to drop them off at her home after work. &quot;Ron interjected he’d be happy to return them,&quot; said Tia Gavin, who waited on the Brown party.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Goldman &quot;punched out at 9:33 pm and stayed another 15 minutes to have bottled water at the bar.&quot; He made plans to go out with Mezzaluna&#x27;s bartender Stewart Tanner later that evening. Before returning the glasses, Goldman stopped by his Brentwood apartment at 11663 Gorham Avenue, presumably to shower and change clothes; his autopsy indicated he ate a salad less than 40 minutes before he was killed. He then drove to Brown’s condominium, using his friend Andrea Scott&#x27;s car.

Goldman and Brown were stabbed to death on the walkway leading to the condominium at 875 South Bundy Drive; their bodies were discovered shortly after midnight. Goldman&#x27;s knuckles were bruised; Simpson&#x27;s defense team argued that this indicated he had fought strongly, while prosecutors argued it was probably from a fall. Goldman had several small wounds to his face. During a reconstruction of events, the police theorized that Brown and Goldman were talking on the front patio of Brown&#x27;s condominium when they were attacked or that Goldman arrived while Brown was being attacked; in any case, the police believe that Brown was the intended target and that Goldman was killed in order to silence him. Witness Robert Heidstra testified that while walking near Brown&#x27;s condominium that night, he heard a man yelling, &quot;Hey! Hey! Hey!&quot; who was then shouted at by a second man. He also heard a gate slam. Goldman&#x27;s family came to believe that Goldman was the man shouting &quot;Hey!&quot; and that he may have attempted to save Brown by intervening in the attack.

Goldman was 20 days shy of his 26th birthday when he died. He is buried at Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village, California.

==Trials==

=== Criminal trial ===
After leading police on a low-speed chase in a now infamous white Ford Bronco, Simpson was tried for the killings of both Brown and Goldman. The trial spanned eight months, from January 24 to October 3, 1995. During the trial, there was some speculation as to whether Goldman and Brown were secretly dating, compounded by three facts, that Brown was wearing a slinky, revealing cocktail dress when she was found dead, candles were lit in the master bedroom and bathroom, and the master bathroom’s tub was full of water.

Though prosecutors argued that Simpson was implicated by a significant amount of forensic evidence, he was acquitted of both murders on October 3. Commentators agree that to convince the jury to acquit Simpson, the defense capitalized on anger among the city&#x27;s African-American community toward the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which had a history of purported racial bias and had allegedly inflamed racial tensions in the beating of Rodney King and subsequent riots two years prior. The trial is often characterized as the trial of the century because of its international publicity and has been described as the &quot;most publicized&quot; criminal trial in history. Simpson was formally charged with the murders on June 17; when he did not turn himself in at the agreed time, he became the subject of a police pursuit. TV stations interrupted coverage of the 1994 NBA Finals to broadcast live coverage of the pursuit, which was watched by around 95 million people. The pursuit and Simpson&#x27;s arrest were among the most widely publicized events in history.

Simpson was represented by a high-profile defense team, referred to as the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, initially led by Robert Shapiro and subsequently directed by Johnnie Cochran. The team included F. Lee Bailey, Alan Dershowitz, Robert Kardashian, Shawn Holley, Carl E. Douglas, and Gerald Uelmen. Simpson was also instrumental in his own defense. While Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark, William Hodgman, and Christopher Darden believed they had a strong case, the defense team persuaded the jury there was reasonable doubt concerning the DNA evidence. They contended the blood sample had been mishandled by lab scientists and that the case had been tainted by LAPD misconduct related to racism and incompetence. The use of DNA evidence in trials was relatively new, and many laypersons did not understand how to evaluate it.

The trial was considered significant for the wide division in reaction to the verdict. Observers&#x27; opinions of the verdict were largely related to their ethnicity; the media dubbed this the &quot;racial gap&quot;. A poll of Los Angeles County residents showed most African Americans thought the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict was justified while most whites thought it was a racially motivated jury nullification by the mostly African-American jury. Polling in later years showed the gap had narrowed since the trial; more than half of polled Black respondents expressed the belief that Simpson was guilty. In 2017, three jurors who acquitted Simpson said they would still vote to acquit, while one said he would convict.

In the 1996 book &quot;Killing Time: The First Full Investigation into the Unsolved Murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman&quot;, authors Donald Freed and Raymond P. Briggs wrote that lipstick was found on Goldman&#x27;s cheek after his death, and suggested that Brown kissed Goldman when he arrived and that they were together on the front porch when they were attacked.

=== Civil trial ===
In 1996, Fred Goldman and Sharon Rufo, the parents of Ron Goldman, and Lou Brown, father of Nicole Brown filed a civil suit against Simpson for wrongful death. Presiding Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki did not allow the trial to be televised, did not sequester the jury, and prohibited the defense from alleging racism by the LAPD and from condemning the crime lab. The physical evidence did not change but additional evidence of domestic violence was presented as well as 31 pre-1994 photos of Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes, including one that was published 6 months before the murders, proving it could not be a forgery. Results from a polygraph test that Simpson denied taking showed &quot;extreme deception&quot; when he denied committing the murders. 

One significant difference between the two trials was the admission of Nicole Brown&#x27;s diary entries in the civil case. The civil judge found the diary entries were admissible because they were pertinent to Nicole&#x27;s state of mind, which in turn was relevant to Simpson&#x27;s motive—reversing a crucial ruling from the criminal case that excluded the diary as &quot;inadmissible hearsay&quot;. The civil court&#x27;s ruling was upheld on appeal. The jury found Simpson liable for the murders and awarded the victims&#x27; families $33.5 million in compensatory and punitive damages. Simpson filed for bankruptcy afterwards and relocated to Florida to protect his pension from seizure. His remaining assets were seized and auctioned off with most being purchased by critics of the verdict of the criminal trial to help the plaintiffs recoup the costs of litigation. Simpson&#x27;s Heisman Trophy was sold for $255,500 to an undisclosed buyer. All the proceeds went to the Goldman family, who said they have received only one percent of the money that Simpson owes from the wrongful death suit.

Simpson was subsequently jailed for an unrelated armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel in 2008. Both Fred and Kim Goldman were present at the robbery trial, and after Simpson&#x27;s conviction, Fred Goldman expressed his satisfaction and referred to it as a &quot;bittersweet&quot; moment. Following Simpson&#x27;s death in 2024, Simpson estate lawyer Malcolm LeVergne pledged to prevent the Brown and Goldman families from obtaining the money which was promised in the civil trial judgement, but later reversed course.

=== Alternate theories and suspects ===
While several members of Simpson&#x27;s family still advocated for Simpson&#x27;s innocence, such theories have been rejected by prosecutors, witnesses and the families of Brown and Goldman, who have expressed the belief that Simpson committed the murders and was the sole perpetrator, with Hunt opining that these claims were attempts to tap into the public interest in the case and were never meant to be taken seriously.

The 2000 BBC TV documentary &quot;O.J.: The True Untold Story&quot;, primarily rehashes the contamination and blood planting claims from the trial and asserted that Simpson&#x27;s elder son Jason is a possible suspect, due to - among other reasons - Simpson hiring defense attorneys for his children first before himself, pictures of Jason&#x27;s descriptive wool cap, and an alleged prior arrangement to meet with Nicole that evening. William Dear published his findings in the book &quot;O.J. Is Innocent and I Can Prove It&quot;.

A 2012 documentary entitled &quot;My Brother the Serial Killer&quot; examined the crimes of convicted murderer Glen Edward Rogers and included claims that Rogers had killed Brown and Goldman in California in 1994. According to Rogers&#x27; brother Clay, Rogers claimed that, before the murders, he had met Brown and was &quot;going to take her down.&quot; During a lengthy correspondence that began in 2009 between Rogers and criminal profiler Anthony Meoli, Rogers wrote and created paintings about his involvement with the murders. During a prison meeting between the two, Rogers claimed Simpson hired him to break into Brown&#x27; house and steal some expensive jewellery. He said that Simpson had told him, &quot;You may have to kill the bitch&quot;. In a filmed interview, Rogers&#x27; brother Clay asserts that his brother confessed his involvement. Rogers&#x27; family stated that he had informed them that he had been working for Brown in 1994 and that he had made verbal threats about her to them. Rogers later spoke to a criminal profiler about the murders, providing details about the crime and remarking that he had been hired by Simpson to steal a pair of earrings and potentially murder Brown. LAPD responded to the documentary as follows: “We know who killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. We have no reason to believe that Mr. Rogers was involved.” Fred Goldman, father of Ron Goldman stated: “The overwhelming evidence at the criminal trial proved that one, and only one, person murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. That person is O.J. Simpson and not Glen Rogers.”

When filmmaker Ezra Edelman, director of the documentary &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, he dedicated the award to both Goldman and Brown in his acceptance speech. Fred Goldman was among those whom Edelman interviewed in the documentary.

During the civil trial, Kim Goldman said that she and Michael Nigg were set-up on a blind date. After a good first date, the two went on 5 or more dates. At the time they were going out together Michael Nigg worked at a restaurant in Santa Barbara and at some point after 1992 Michael moved to Los Angeles. Kim Goldman testified that she never introduced her brother to Michael Nigg and she did not see Michael after he moved to Los Angeles. She stated she was unaware how her brother, Ron, and Michael met; she testified that the two met by happenstance. The two men apparently became good friends because, according to Ms. Goldman, Michael Nigg got her brother the job at Mezzaluna. While Kim Goldman does not have knowledge of Michael having worked at Mezzaluna, according to the Los Angeles Times Michael Nigg had been employed at Mezzaluna in Brentwood at some point. At the time of his death Michael Nigg was working at a restaurant called Sanctuary that was located in Beverly Hills. Some news reports claim that Michael Nigg “befriended Ronald Goldman when both worked at the Mezzaluna restaurant” however Ms. Goldman’s testimony establishes that the two men were friends prior to Ron being hired at Mezzaluna. It is unknown if Michael Nigg and Ron Goldman’s tenures at Mezzaluna overlapped. In an interview with &quot;20/20&quot;, Kim Goldman said that one day some time after Simpson&#x27;s acquittal, she was driving in her car when she saw him in a parking lot in Los Angeles. She considered running him over to get vengeance, but decided otherwise.

In 2017, Goldman family attorney David Cook claimed that Sydney and Justin Simpson, the children of Simpson and Brown, had gone on a real estate spending spree using money that the Goldmans believe had been hidden away by their father years ago. The attorney for the Goldmans stated that Justin and Sydney Simpson’s &quot;loss is no greater than Fred’s, but Fred’s loss should be no greater than theirs.&quot;

In 2022, Fred Goldman applied for a renewal of his old judgment against Simpson, claiming Simpson still owed him $96 million. 

When Simpson died in 2024, Fred Goldman initially called Simpson’s death &quot;no great loss to the world&quot; but also said that it was &quot;just a further reminder of how long my son has been gone...how many years, and how much he’s been missed. And the only thing that is important today are (Ron and Nicole). Nothing else is important.&quot; Kim and Fred later issued a statement that read, &quot;The hope for true accountability has ended... Thank you for keeping our family, and most importantly Ron, in your hearts&quot;. Fred Goldman said that he will still pursue &quot;justice&quot; for his son after Simpson&#x27;s attorney said that the Goldman family will get &quot;nothing&quot; from the estate. A few days later, Simpson&#x27;s attorney backtracked and confirmed that Simpson&#x27;s estate will settle the legal verdict with the Brown and Goldman families, and said that his statements were made out of a moment of frustration over what he felt were &quot;insensitive&quot; remarks about Simpson&#x27;s death.

=== Foundation ===
The Goldman family contributed a portion of proceeds from the &quot;If I Did It&quot; book sales to the newly founded Ron Goldman Foundation for Justice. It provides grants for multiple organizations and programs that provide resources to victims and survivors of violent crimes. One of the largest donors to the foundation is Las Vegas executive Mark Goldman, Fred Goldman&#x27;s first cousin.

== Media ==

Simpson wrote a book, &quot;If I Did It&quot;, a first-person account of how he would have committed the murders if he had committed them. In Simpson&#x27;s hypothetical scenario, he has an unwilling accomplice named &quot;Charlie&quot; who urges him to not engage with Brown, whom Simpson plans to &quot;scare the shit out of&quot;. Simpson ignores Charlie&#x27;s advice and continues to Brown&#x27;s condo, where he finds and confronts Ron Goldman. According to the book, Brown falls and hits her head on the concrete, and Goldman crouches in a karate pose. As the confrontation escalates, Simpson writes, &quot;Then something went horribly wrong, and I know &quot;what&quot; happened, but I can&#x27;t tell you &quot;how&quot;.&quot; He writes that he regained consciousness later with no memory of the actual act of murder.

Simpson&#x27;s eldest daughter, Arnelle Simpson, testified in a deposition that she and Van Exel, president of Raffles Entertainment and Music Production, came up with the idea for the book and pitched it to her father in an attempt to make money. She testified that her father thought about it and eventually agreed to the book deal. Simpson stated, &quot;I have nothing to confess. This was an opportunity for my kids to get their financial legacy. My kids understand. I made it clear that it&#x27;s blood money, but it&#x27;s no different than any of the other writers who did books on this case.&quot;

According to court documents, in August 2007, as part of the multi-million dollar civil jury award against Simpson to ensure he would not be able to profit from the book, the Goldman family were granted the proceeds from the book. The Goldman family still own the copyright, media rights, and movie rights and have acquired Simpson&#x27;s name, likeness, life story, and right of publicity in connection with the book. After renaming the book &quot;If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer&quot;, the Goldman family published it in September 2007 through Beaufort Books. Denise Brown, Nicole Brown&#x27;s sister, criticized the Goldmans for publishing the book and accused them of profiting from Brown and Goldman&#x27;s deaths.

<doc id="430439" wikidata="Q702878" url="?curid=430439" title="Eulji Mundeok">
<text>Eulji Mundeok (; Ulchi Mundok) was a military leader of early 7th century Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, who successfully defended Goguryeo against Sui China. He is famous for his victory at Salsu, and is often numbered among the greatest heroes in the military history of Korea.

== Background ==
Eulji Mundeok was born in the mid-6th century and died sometime after 618, although the exact date is unknown. &quot;Haedong Myeongjangjeon&quot;, known as the &quot;Biographies of Famed Korean Generals&quot;, written in the 18th century, states that he was from Seokda Mountain (石多山) near Pyongyang. At the time of his birth, Goguryeo was a powerful state, frequently at war with its neighbors.

In 589, the Sui dynasty conquered several surrounding states and launched several large military campaigns against Goguryeo, which was unwilling to submit to its dominance.

Eulji Mundeok was a cultured man, skilled in both the martial and literary arts. He eventually rose to become the supreme commander of Goguryeo. The name &quot;Eulji&quot; may actually be a Goguryeo title.

There is a theory that Eulji Mundeok was originally of Xianbei origin.

== The Battle of Salsu River ==
After the founding of Sui in 589, a precarious peace was maintained for several years between the new Chinese dynasty and Goguryeo. However, in 597, Yeongyang launched an attack on the Sui at the Battle of Linyuguan. In response, Sui invaded Goguryeo, but the invasion was defeated due to constant ambushes and unfavorable weather.

In the early 7th century, Emperor Yang learned of a secret correspondence between Goguryeo and the Eastern Turkic Khaganate. Emperor Yang demanded Yeongyang come and submit personally to him or face an &quot;imperial tour of his territories&quot;. When Yeongyang failed to do so, Emperor Yang prepared for war. He mustered an army of over 1,133,000 troops and more than 2 million auxiliaries and personally led them against Goguryeo in 612. The Sui army quickly overran Goguryeo&#x27;s border defenses, then camped on the banks of the Liao River and prepared to bridge it.

Eulji Mundeok, commissioned as the Field Marshal, was called upon to defend the nation. He prepared his troops to meet the numerically superior Sui forces with a strategy of deception, using feigned retreats and sudden attacks. After the Sui forces crossed the Liao River, a small contingent was sent to attack the city of Yodong, but was repulsed by Eulji Mundeok&#x27;s forces. As the rainy season progressed, the Sui forces launched other small probing attacks, but held off from making any large moves before the end of the rainy season.

When the rains stopped, Emperor Yang moved his forces to the banks of the Yalu River in northwestern Korea and prepared for a major battle. Fighting only small engagements at times and places of his choosing, Eulji Mundeok drew the Sui forces further and further from their supply centers. Emperor Yang sent an advance force of over 305,000 troops to take the city of Pyongyang. After allowing the force to approach the city, Field Marshal Eulji Mundeok ambushed it. His forces attacked from all sides, driving the Sui troops back in utter confusion. His troops pursued the retreating army, slaughtering them at will. Records claim that only 2,800 men of the massive force returned alive to the main Chinese army. This battle, the Battle of Salsu, came to be known as one of the most glorious military triumphs in Korea&#x27;s national history.

After the battle, winter began to set in and the Sui forces, short on provisions, were forced to return home in defeat.

== Death ==
It is not known when Eulji Mundeok died. His name is not attested to after 613.

The Sui dynasty was beginning to disintegrate and Emperor Yang decided that he urgently needed to expand his empire in order to regain power, but two more attacks on Goguryeo in the following spring were met with similar disasters, and eventually internal rebellion in China forced him to abandon his desire for Goguryeo. By 618, the relatively short-lived Sui dynasty was replaced by the Tang dynasty. Field Marshal Eulji Mundeok&#x27;s strategy and leadership had protected Goguryeo from Chinese expansion into the Korean peninsula.

== Legacy ==
One of the most distinguished military leaders of the Goguryeo period, Eulji Mundeok&#x27;s leadership and tactical acumen were the decisive factors in defeating the Sui invasion. Facing numerically superior forces, he developed a strategy that allowed him to secure a decisive victory. Such brilliant tactical success earned him a permanent place among Korea&#x27;s most famous leaders. Kim Bu-sik, the author of the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, also attributed the victory over Sui to Eulji Mundeok.

In Korea, Eulji Mundeok is recognized as one of the greatest figures in its national history. During the reign of Hyeonjong in the Goryeo period, a shrine to Eulji Mundeok was built near Pyongyang. In the succeeding Joseon period, he remained just as revered a figure. Yang Seong-ji, a scholar and high-ranking bureaucrat of 15th century Joseon, and An Jeong-bok, a Silhak historian of 18th century Joseon, both thought highly of him. Furthermore, King Sukjong ordered the construction of another shrine in honor of Eulji Mundeok in 1680.

At a time when Korea was suffering under the yoke of Japanese imperialism, a fuller assessment of Eulji Mundeok was commenced by the Korean historian Shin Chaeho, who published a biography of the famed general in 1908 and held him out as an example of Korea&#x27;s traditional nationalist spirit. Eulji Mundeok is still celebrated as a national hero. One of the most preeminent Korean scholars of the 20th century, Lee Ki-baik, noted that Eulji Mundeok&#x27;s efforts in halting the Sui attempt at conquest stand as one of the earliest examples of Korean attempts to fend off foreign domination.

In South Korea, a main thoroughfare in downtown Seoul, Euljiro, is named after Eulji Mundeok.

The second highest military decoration of South Korea is named after Eulji Mundeok.

The Republic of Korea Navy named a Gwanggaeto the Great-class destroyer in honor of Eulji Mundeok.

Eulji Mundeok&#x27;s literary work, the Eulji Mundeok Hansi, is one of the oldest surviving poems in Korean literature.

One of the biannual Combined Forces Command exercises between South Korea and the United States was called Ulchi-Focus Lens (UFL) in honor of Eulji Mundeok. It was renamed to Ulchi-Freedom Guardian (UFG) in 2015. UFG is the world&#x27;s largest computerized command and control exercise, focusing on how US and ROK forces would defend against a North Korean attack.

<text>Air Algérie Flight 6289 (AH6289) was an Algerian domestic passenger flight from Tamanrasset to the nation&#x27;s capital of Algiers with a stopover in Ghardaïa, operated by Algerian national airline Air Algérie. On 6 March 2003, the aircraft operating the flight, a Boeing 737-2T4, crashed near the Trans-Sahara Highway shortly after taking off from Tamanrasset&#x27;s Aguenar – Hadj Bey Akhamok Airport, killing all but one of the 103 people on board. At the time of the accident, it was the deadliest aviation disaster on Algerian soil.

The investigation concluded that a flight crew error caused the crash following an engine failure shortly after take-off. The captain of Flight 6289 had taken over the control from the first officer without adequate identification of the actual emergency. As the flight crew could not comprehend the exact cause of the emergency, appropriate corrective actions were not taken. The speed drastically dropped and the aircraft crashed into the terrain.

==Background==
===Aircraft===
The aircraft was a 19-year old Boeing 737-2T4 with a manufacturer serial number of 22700. Named as Monts de Daïa (Mountains of Daïa) with an Algerian registration of 7T-VEZ, the aircraft was equipped with two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-17A engines. The aircraft entered service on 9 December 1983 and had flown for more than 40,000 hours.

According to the maintenance logs, the aircraft was maintained in accordance with the written maintenance manual. The last major overhaul had been conducted from October to November 2002. The left engine was installed in 2002 and the right engine was installed in 2001. The left engine and the right engine had accrued a total of 30,586 flight hours and 22,884 flight hours, respectively.

===Passengers and crew===
The aircraft was carrying 97 passengers. Most of those on board were Algerians. Authorities stated that among the 97 passengers, a total of 39 passengers would have disembarked in Algiers and another 58 were heading to Ghardaia. At least 7 French nationals were initially thought to be on board the flight. The number was later revised down to 6. Among the passengers were 14 members of the Mouloudia d&#x27;Adriane football team, who were heading to Ghardaia for the regional qualification of the Algerian League One.

There were 6 crew members on board, consisting of 2 flight crew and 4 cabin crew. The captain, 48-year-old Boualem Benaouicha, had accumulated a total of 10,760 hours of flight experience, including 1,087 hours on the Boeing 737-200 as captain. He had obtained his license to fly a Boeing 737 in 2001. The first officer, identified as 44-year-old Fatima Yousfi, had accumulated a total of 5,219 flight hours, including 1,292 hours on the Boeing 737-200. According to Algerian French-language newspaper &quot;Liberté&quot;, she was a sister of Algerian government official Youcef Yousfi.

== Accident ==

Flight 6289 was a flight from Tamanrasset, the capital of Tamanrasset Province, to the Algerian capital of Algiers with a stopover in Ghardaia. The flight was popular for Algerians and tourists as Tamanrasset was known for its archaeological sites and was the capital of the Tuareg people. The fare was also described as fairly cheap. On 6 March 2003, the flight was carrying 97 passengers and 6 crew members, with First Officer Yousfi as the pilot flying. The temperature was high and the visibility was good.

At about 15:01 CET, pushback clearance was requested by the crew and the ATC cleared the crew to taxi to Runway 02. As the flight crew reported that they were ready for take-off, the ATC later asked the crew to line up and later cleared the crew for take-off to Ghardaia. The crew chose a V1 of , VR of and V2 of with a maximum thrust on take-off.

Flight 6289 took off from Tamanrasset at 15:13 CET. Shortly after, an explosion occurred in one of the engines. The explosion was loud enough to be heard by workers in Tamanrasset&#x27;s air traffic control tower and other witnesses in the area. Debris was seen dropping onto the runway. Due to the explosion, the aircraft swayed to the left; later it veered to the right as the crew tried to correct its heading. Seconds later, First Officer Yousfi reported: &quot;We have a small problem&quot;.

The aircraft continued to climb with its landing gear still extended, reaching a maximum height of around before its airspeed significantly dropped from to its stall speed. It descended with its nose in up position and eventually crashed onto a field at 15:15 CET, striking the ground with its right side and bursting into flames. The wreckage slid across the ground and struck the airport&#x27;s perimeter fence, crossed a road and finally came to rest.

The impact and the fire that had erupted due to the crash immediately killed 102 people on board. The cockpit occupants, including the captain, first officer, and the chief attendant, were killed due to the impact. The rest of the occupants were killed due to the massive explosion that had been caused by the crash. The sole survivor of the accident was 28-year-old Algerian soldier Youcef Djillali. He was seated in the last row with his seat belt unfastened (as indicated in his statement) and was ejected from the plane upon impact, escaping from the accident. The man was found in a coma with multiple injuries. However, he regained consciousness the next day. Doctors said that his injuries were not life-threatening.

== Investigation ==
Prime Minister of Algeria Ali Benflis immediately set up a commission to investigate the accident. Under the Algerian Ministry of Transport, the commission was led by M. Affane, Director General of the Algerian Ministry of Transport. Technical support from the French BEA was requested. Additionally, the investigation was assisted by representatives from the NTSB, FAA and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. A total of seven meetings were held to analyze the result and the progress of the investigation.

=== Engine failure on take-off ===
There were widespread reports that one of the engines had caught fire shortly after take-off from Tamanrasset. Officials also reported that &quot;technical problems&quot; might have been the cause of the crash as there had been reports of an explosion on one of the engines. Testimonies from multiple witnesses were consistent with an explosion as they claimed that a large thumping noise was heard immediately after take-off from Tamanrasset. Initial examination on the runway later revealed the presence of debris from one of the aircraft&#x27;s engines. During the wreckage examination, investigators discovered that during the flight the left engine was rotating at low speed with no thrust.

A more thorough examination was then carried out. Analysis on the left engine revealed that the nozzle guide vanes (stator blades) had been severely damaged, particularly on the lower part of the engine. As some parts of the guide vanes were destroyed, the gas inside the engine could not normally expand and eventually prevented the cooling stage, which was triggered by gas leaving the gas chamber. The absence of cooling then caused the high temperature to melt the guide vanes of the low pressure part of the engine, destroying the lower pressure part. This in turn caused a massive drop in engine rotation speed. Metallurgical analysis on the nozzle guide vanes of the high pressure part revealed that there were fatigue cracks on one of the blades, indicating that a blade had broken off during the take-off. The conclusion was that this was the source of the engine failure.

After the accident, the findings led to the conclusion that an engine failure indeed had occurred aboard the flight. However, the engine failure was actually contained inside the engine itself. The engine cowling did not blow in the outward direction, which would have indicated an uncontained engine failure. In the case of uncontained engine failure, the resulting damage would have caused a significant amount of drag, complicating the aircraft&#x27;s control and ultimately caused the decay of the aircraft&#x27;s speed. As the engine failure in Flight 6289 was actually contained, flight control would not have been much compromised. The crew should have been able to conduct an emergency landing with only one working engine.

=== Flight recorders analysis ===
The contained engine failure should not have caused the aircraft to crash as it would not have resulted in control difficulty. With a contained engine failure on only one engine, the crew should have been able to return to the airport safely. A further confirmation was needed from the flight recorders to understand the situation on board that might have explained the exact cause of the crash.

The flight recorders were retrieved from the wreckage on the same day of the accident. The CVR showed few signs of damage, while the FDR was exposed to fire. Both recorders&#x27; memory cards were in good condition, allowing a direct readout. On 13 March, the readout was performed by BEA. Due to the old age of the FDR, there were only six recorded parameters: time, pressure altitude, speed, magnetic heading, vertical acceleration, and send/receive VHF communication.

According to the recorders, during the preparation for the flight, First Officer Yousfi had conducted the pre-departure checklist by herself as Captain Benaouicha was running late. He eventually arrived when Yousfi was about to give the pre-flight briefing to the crew members. During the taxiing, the captain could be heard conversing with the chief attendant, who was also in the cockpit, rather than paying attention to the flight operation. There was no discussion on the possible anomaly that might have occurred in-flight, as per the approved Air Algérie procedure.

As the aircraft reached its rotation speed, Captain Benaouicha called for rotation (lift the nose wheel off the ground during takeoff). First Officer Yousfi then asked for gear retraction. A second later, a loud thump was heard, indicating the start of the left engine failure. Startled, the first officer immediately exclaimed the &quot;basmala&quot; several times, later asking &quot;What&#x27;s going on?&quot; The captain immediately took over the control and asked Yousfi to let go of the controls. She stated that she had let go and later offered to retract the gear, to which the captain made no response.

First Officer Yousfi immediately reported that Flight 6289 was experiencing a small problem. The aircraft then climbed to a maximum altitude of 398 ft with a speed of 134 knots. The altitude and the speed then dropped and the stick shaker was activated for one second, warning the crew of an impending stall. The speed continued to drop and the aircraft finally entered a full stall. Captain Benaouicha, somehow still unconvinced, repeatedly asked Yousfi to let go of the yoke. She kept insisting that she had let go. This conflict continued until the end of the recording. At , both recordings abruptly stopped. The last recorded voice was the &quot;Don&#x27;t sink&quot; alarm from the aircraft&#x27;s GPWS. The speed was at 126 knots and the landing gear was still in extended position.

=== Failure to fly ===
There were multiple factors that ultimately caused the aircraft&#x27;s inability to fly safely. Investigators stated that the occurrence of an engine failure during a critical phase of the flight (e.g., during the aircraft&#x27;s rotation) would have provided the crew with a very limited amount of time to assess the situation. The take-off weight of Flight 6289 at the time was near its maximum allowable take-off weight, causing a reduction in the aircraft&#x27;s ability to take-off. The location of the airport and the weather condition, which was located at an elevation of 1,300 ft with a typical hot desert temperature at noon, caused the air density to decrease. The reduction in air density resulted in the reduction of the engine output as well. Thus, the aircraft would have needed a higher airspeed to take off from the runway.

However, management of the emergency by the flight crew was the most crucial part for the aircraft to be able to return in a safe manner. If the flight crew had taken the correct actions for the emergency immediately, the aircraft would not have crashed onto the field.

The first sign of crew error was apparent from the initial stage of the flight. Prior to take-off, First Officer Yousfi was about to give the crew members a pre-flight briefing when she was suddenly interrupted by Captain Benaouicha. The captain immediately chatted with the chief flight attendant and thus the briefing was discontinued. The pre-flight briefing was crucial as this was the exact moment when flight crew were informed on the roles of each crew members and the appropriate procedures that the crew should have taken in case the crew faced an anomaly during the take-off. The interrupted briefing indicated the crew&#x27;s failure to emphasize the importance of flight safety in regards to the possible anomalies that might be encountered during a critical phase of the flight.

Benaouicha kept talking to the chief flight attendant even during the aircraft&#x27;s taxi. This was a breach of the sterile cockpit rule, which prohibited flight crew from engaging in conversations unrelated to the flight during critical phases. During the entire conversation, not a single dialogue was related to a possible anomaly on take-off.

During the aircraft&#x27;s rotation, the engine suddenly malfunctioned. Benaouicha, without hesitation, immediately initiated a switching of roles from pilot not flying (PNF) to pilot flying (PF). His previous role required him to scan the instruments so that the flight crew could understand the exact cause of the emergency. As he was not a PNF anymore, his duty to monitor the aircraft&#x27;s instruments was immediately handed over to the first officer, who had been at the controls for the entire time prior to the role switch. His decision to switch his role as a PF was unclear. Both flight crew had not agreed to switch roles in case of a flight emergency, leading the first officer to be confused by the captain&#x27;s decision.

As his tasks were immediately transferred to the first officer, the captain could not fully understand the situation at the time. While he was taking over the control, he repeatedly asked the first officer to let go of the yoke. The first officer was unsure of her flight role due to the sudden role switch. This was indicated by the recording. During the stall warning activation, the first officer&#x27;s hands were still at the control column.

The sudden switch also created a sudden increase of stress for the captain. Overwhelmed, the captain was only focusing on the pitch attitude of the aircraft. He maintained an excessive angle of attack during the entire emergency. His decision was probably influenced by the rocky environment of the airport, which would have made it impossible for the crew to conduct an emergency landing.

At the time of the emergency, the landing gear was still in the extended position. During an engine failure on take-off, the crew should have immediately retracted the landing gear as the extension of landing gear would have resulted in difficult aerodynamics for the aircraft, thus causing a progressive decline of airspeed. It was the PF&#x27;s duty to retract the landing gear. Just one second prior to the engine failure, First Officer Yousfi was the PF and she had actually requested the captain to retract the landing gear. However, as the role was immediately switched by the captain, it was then up to the captain to request a gear retraction. During the emergency, Yousfi had offered to retract the landing gear. As Benaouicha was preoccupied with the emergency, he did not hear the first officer&#x27;s offer. The gear then remained in the extended position and the aircraft stayed in its high pitch attitude, diminishing its ability to fly and ultimately causing it to crash.

=== Conclusion ===
The final report was published with the following: 
The temperature on the 6th March 2003 at the airport was 23 degrees celsius, the height of the airport is 1377 metres and the weight of the plane was 48708 kg, The maximum authorized weight of a 737-2T4 is 49500 kg.

Following the crash, investigators asked Air Algérie to ensure that their cockpit resource management (CRM) training effectively heighten flight crew awareness on the strict respect of following the procedures of the appropriate hand-over and task-sharing. Other recommendations were also issued to the Algerian government.

==Aftermath==
Crisis centres were immediately set up in Algiers and Paris. Government officials, including Interior Minister Moureddine Yazid Zerhouni and Transport Minister Abdelmalek Sellal, visited Tamanrasset to observe the crash site. A repatriation ceremony for the six French victims was held in Algiers. At least two of the victims were sent to Marseilles while the other four were flown to Paris.

Officials agreed to build a monument for the victims of the crash. A monument was later erected near the crash site of Flight 6289. Multiple events were also held to commemorate the victims of the crash. In the nearby Ben Messaoud sports complex in Iméchouène, multiple mini-tournaments were held for the residents in the area. Special sponsorship would also be given to Mouloudia d&#x27;Adriane, the football club that lost 14 members of the team in the crash. Minister of Youth and Sports El Hadi Ould Ali stated that &quot;The state does not forget its children and full support will be given to the club so that it can return to the sports scene&quot;. After the crash, the football club worked hard to promote multiple sport activities in Tamanrasset.

In response to the crash, investigators issued a recommendation for the Algerian government to create an independent investigative body for aircraft accidents in the country. However, this recommendation was not enacted and as of 2024 there is still no independent aircraft accident investigation commission in Algeria.

<doc id="430444" wikidata="Q1983009" url="?curid=430444" title="Manifesto of Futurism">
<text>The Manifesto of Futurism (Italian: &quot;Manifesto del Futurismo&quot;) is a manifesto written by the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, published in 1909. In it, Marinetti expresses an artistic philosophy called Futurism, which rejected the past and celebrated speed, machinery, violence, youth, and industry. The manifesto also advocated for the modernization and cultural rejuvenation of Italy.

==Publication==
Marinetti wrote the manifesto in the autumn of 1908, and it first appeared as a preface to a volume of his poems, published in Milan in January 1909. It was published in the Italian newspaper &quot;Gazzetta dell&#x27;Emilia&quot; in Bologna on 5 February 1909, and then in French as &quot;Manifeste du futurisme&quot; (&quot;Manifesto of Futurism&quot;) in the newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; on 20 February 1909. The April 1909 issue of Marinetti&#x27;s &quot;Poesia&quot; focused on the manifesto, and the Italian and French versions were reprinted in March 1912 alongside the English version. In April 1909, the Madrid-based magazine &quot;Prometeo&quot; published the Spanish translation of the manifesto, which was translated by Ramón Gómez de la Serna.

== Contents ==
At the end of the 19th century, the Futurists challenged the limits of Italian literature (see articles 1, 2, and 3). Their response included the use of deliberate excesses to demonstrate the existence of a dynamic, surviving Italian intellectual class.

During this period, when industry was becoming increasingly important across Europe, the Futurists sought to affirm that Italy was not only present but also possessed industry and the power to participate in new experiences. They believed Italy would find the essence of progress in major symbols like the car and its speed (see article 4). While nationalism was never openly declared, it was evident in their work.

The Futurists argued that literature would not be overshadowed by progress; instead, it would absorb progress as part of its natural evolution. They believed that progress must manifest in this way because man, through it, would unleash his instinctive nature. Man was reacting against the potentially overwhelming force of progress, asserting his centrality. Man would harness speed, rather than be dominated by it (see articles 5 and 6).

Poetry would help man embrace the idea that his soul is part of this transformation (see articles 6 and 7), introducing a new concept of beauty rooted in the human instinct for aggression.

The sense of history could not be overlooked, as this was a pivotal moment when many things were evolving into new forms and content. However, man would be able to navigate these changes (see article 8), carrying with him the essence of what has existed since the beginning of civilization.

In Article 9, war is described as a necessity for the health of the human spirit, a form of purification that promotes and benefits idealism. The Futurists&#x27; explicit glorification of war and its &quot;hygienic&quot; qualities influenced the ideology of fascism. Marinetti remained active in fascist politics until he withdrew in protest against the focus on &quot;Roman Grandeur,&quot; which had come to dominate fascist aesthetics.

Article 10 states: &quot;We want to demolish museums and libraries, fight morality, feminism, and all opportunist and utilitarian cowardice.&quot; However, Futurism scholar Günter Berghaus argues that Marinetti&#x27;s stance against &quot;feminism&quot; in Article 10 is unclear, especially when contrasted with his publication of works by women Futurists in the literary journal &quot;Poesia&quot;.

== Meaning ==
This manifesto was published well before the occurrence of the 20th-century events commonly associated with its potential meaning. However, the political movements underlying these events were already well-established and undoubtedly informed Marinetti&#x27;s thinking, while his publication subsequently influenced them. Most notably, the rise of Italian Fascism, which the manifesto is widely seen as a precursor to, and Mussolini, who often quoted Marinetti. At the time of its publication, the manifesto was frequently cited as an &quot;imagining of the future&quot; for some of these political movements, glorifying violence and conflict, and calling for the destruction of cultural institutions like museums and libraries. For example, the Russian Revolutions of 1917, the first successfully sustained revolution of the type described in Article 11, echoed these ideas. The earlier, smaller-scale peasant uprisings known as the Russian Revolution, which led to the creation of a Russian constitution by the State Duma in 1906, occurred just before the manifesto&#x27;s publication.

The founding manifesto did not include a positive artistic program, which the Futurists aimed to establish in their subsequent &quot;Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting&quot; (1914). This commitment to a &quot;universal dynamism&quot; was intended to be directly represented in painting. In reality, objects are not separate from one another or their surroundings: &quot;The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places. ... The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn, the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it.&quot;

== Women in Futurism ==
Several women were active in the Futurist movement and contributed to its manifestos. Benedetta Cappa worked in ceramics, glass, paint, and metal to explore the concept of aeropainting. She also co-wrote the &quot;Manifesto of Tattilismo&quot; alongside her husband, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. The manifesto asserts that art is meant to be touched and experienced with the body.

The 2nd Rifle Division was formed in Moscow in September 1918. It fought at Ufa on the Eastern Front in April–July 1919. Then it fought against Yudenich with the 7th Army in October–December 1919. Finally it fought in the Polish Campaign on the Western Front in May–August 1920, and against Bulak-Balakhovich in October 1920.

==Second World War ==

<text>The Limberlost Swamp in the eastern part of the present-day U.S. state of Indiana was a large, nationally known wetlands region with streams that flowed into the Wabash River. It originally covered 13,000 acres (53 km2) of present-day Adams and Jay counties. Parts of it were known as the Loblolly Marsh, based on a word by local 
Miami Native Americans for the sulphur smell of the marsh gas. The wetlands had mixed vegetation and supported a rich biodiversity, significant for local and migrating birds and insects, as well as other animals and life.

European Americans drained the Limberlost for agricultural development early in the 20th century, destroying the rich habitat. Since 1997, parts of it have been restored. Observers have documented a return of insects, birds, and wildlife of all sorts to the restored area of wetlands. Approximately had been restored as of 2015. Several groups supported purchase of lands for what is now known as the Loblolly Marsh Nature Preserve, which was turned over to the state and is held by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.

==Origin of name==
According to the &quot;History of Jay County&quot; by Marcus Whitman Montgomery, published in 1864, the name Limberlost came from the following event: 
A man named James Miller, while hunting along the banks of the swamp, became lost. After various fruitless efforts to find his way home, in which he would always come around to the place of starting, he determined to go in a straight course, and so, every few rods he would blaze a tree. While doing this, he was found by friends. Being an agile man, he was known as &#x27;limber Jim,&#x27; and, after this, the stream was called &#x27;Limberlost.&#x27;

The Indiana State Museum contends, &quot;The swamp received its name from the fate of &#x27;Limber Jim&#x27; Corbus, who went hunting in the swamp and never returned. When the locals asked where Jim Corbus was, the familiar cry was &#x27;Limber&#x27;s lost!&#x27;&quot;

==Draining, development, and restoration==
After being drained from 1888 to 1910 by a steam-powered dredge, the area was cultivated as farmland for 80 years. In 1991, local citizen Ken Brunswick established &quot;Limberlost Swamp Remembered,&quot; a group organized to restore some of the wetlands, because of their importance as habitat. The work has included removing or blocking drainage tiles, allowing water back on the land, and planting native species of trees, bushes and flowers. As of 2015, The Loblolly Marsh had been entered into Indiana&#x27;s Wetland Reserve Program by five owners; it was purchased with funds from The Indiana Heritage Trust, ACRES Land Trust, Ropchan Foundation, M.E. Raker Foundation, and Friends of the Limberlost/Limberlost Swamp Remembered Committee.

An alternate name for the area was Loblolly Marsh. This name has been said to have been derived from a Miami language word for &quot;stinking river,&quot; related to the sulfur smell of marsh gas). However, the Oxford English Dictionary says that &quot;loblolly&quot; means a thick gruel or porridge, and that it occurs in the US as a colloquialism for a mud-hole. One quotation given by the OED, from &quot;The Log of a Cowboy&quot; by the Western writer Andy Adams, is &quot;His ineffectual struggles caused him to sink farther to the flanks in the loblolly which the tramping of the cattle had caused.&quot;
The restored marsh has already attracted numerous species of insects, birds, and animals as the first major section has been restored. The 428-acre restoration project was dedicated as the Loblolly Marsh Wetland Preserve in 1997. Activists have included students from Ball State University, who participated in restoration activities, such as planting native habitat. Approximately have been purchased and restored.

As of 2015, the Loblolly Marsh Nature Preserve is held by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. It has a parking area and walking trails, including Veronica’s Trail--0.25 mile wheelchair-accessible wooden boardwalk built to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The preserve&#x27;s floodplains connect to the Wabash River and support river bulrush, sedges, prairie cord grass, burr reed and cattails. The upland area contains a 25-acre mature woodland of hardwood trees.

==Representation in media==
* Indiana-born author Gene Stratton-Porter helped make the Limberlost Swamp famous in the early 20th century. She lived for years on its periphery and lobbied unsuccessfully against its ongoing destruction. The swamp served as the setting for two of her novels, &quot;Freckles&quot; (1904) and &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; (1909). Her novel &quot;The Harvester&quot; (1911) includes the names of many of the plants found in the swamp around the time the book was written. Stratton-Porter was also an accomplished artist and wildlife photographer who specialized in making close-up photographs of the birds and moths in their natural habitat. Several of her nonfiction nature books, including &quot;Moths of the Limberlost&quot; (1912), feature the swamp&#x27;s wildlife. Her residences in the area became the laboratories for her research. They are preserved today as the Limberlost Cabin, the Limberlost State Historic Site in Geneva, and the Cabin at Wildflower Woods. The Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites operates Stratton-Porter&#x27;s former homes as state historic sites, which are open to the public.
*&quot;Romance of the Limberlost&quot; (1938) is an American moving picture based on Stratton-Porter&#x27;s writings and directed by William Nigh, and starring Jean Parker and Eric Linden. It is set in Indiana&#x27;s Limberlost region in 1905.

<text>Lewis Fry Richardson, FRS (11 October 1881 – 30 September 1953) was an English mathematician, physicist, meteorologist, psychologist, and pacifist who pioneered modern mathematical techniques of weather forecasting, and the application of similar techniques to studying the causes of wars and how to prevent them. He is also noted for his pioneering work on fractals and a method for solving a system of linear equations known as modified Richardson iteration.

==Early life==
Lewis Fry Richardson was the youngest of seven children born to Catherine Fry (1838–1919) and David Richardson (1835–1913). They were a prosperous Quaker family, David Richardson operating a successful tanning and leather-manufacturing business.

At age 12 he was sent to a Quaker boarding school, Bootham School in York, where he received an education in science, which stimulated an active interest in natural history. In 1898 he went on to Durham College of Science (a college of Durham University) where he took courses in mathematical physics, chemistry, botany, and zoology. He proceeded in 1900 to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was taught physics in the natural sciences tripos by (among others) J. J. Thomson and graduated with a first-class degree in 1903. At age 47 he received a doctorate in mathematical psychology from the University of London.

==Career==
Richardson&#x27;s working life represented his eclectic interests:
* National Physical Laboratory (1903–1904).
* University College Aberystwyth (1905–1906).
* Chemist, National Peat Industries (1906–1907).
* National Physical Laboratory (1907–1909).
* Manager of the physical and chemical laboratory, Sunbeam Lamp Company (1909–1912).
* Manchester College of Technology (1912–1913).
* Meteorological Office – as superintendent of Eskdalemuir Observatory (1913–1916).
* Friends Ambulance Unit in France (1916–1919).
* Meteorological Office at Benson, Oxfordshire (1919–1920).
* Head of the Physics Department at Westminster Training College (1920–1929).
* Principal, Paisley Technical College, now part of the University of the West of Scotland (1929–1940).

In 1926, he was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society.

==Pacifism==
Richardson&#x27;s Quaker beliefs entailed an ardent pacifism that exempted him from military service during World War I as a conscientious objector, though this subsequently disqualified him from having any academic post. Richardson worked from 1916 to 1919 for the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit attached to the 16th French Infantry Division. After the war, he rejoined the Meteorological Office but was compelled to resign on grounds of conscience when it was amalgamated into the Air Ministry in 1920. He subsequently pursued a career on the fringes of the academic world before retiring in 1940 to research his own ideas. His pacifism influenced his research interests. According to Thomas Körner, the discovery that his meteorological work was of value to chemical weapons designers caused him to abandon his efforts in this field and destroy findings he had not yet published.

==Weather forecasting==
Richardson&#x27;s interest in meteorology led him to propose a scheme for weather forecasting by solution of differential equations, the method used nowadays, though when he published &quot;Weather Prediction by Numerical Process&quot; in 1922, suitable fast computing was unavailable. He described his ideas thus:
After so much hard reasoning, may one play with a fantasy? Imagine a large hall like a theatre, except that the circles and galleries go right round through the space usually occupied by the stage. The walls of this chamber are painted to form a map of the globe. The ceiling represents the north polar regions, England is in the gallery, the tropics in the upper circle, Australia on the dress circle and the Antarctic in the pit.
A myriad computers [people who compute] are at work upon the weather of the part of the map where each sits, but each computer attends only to one equation or part of an equation. The work of each region is coordinated by an official of higher rank. Numerous little &quot;night signs&quot; display the instantaneous values so that neighbouring computers can read them. Each number is thus displayed in three adjacent zones so as to maintain communication to the North and South on the map.
From the floor of the pit a tall pillar rises to half the height of the hall. It carries a large pulpit on its top. In this sits the man in charge of the whole theatre; he is surrounded by several assistants and messengers. One of his duties is to maintain a uniform speed of progress in all parts of the globe. In this respect he is like the conductor of an orchestra in which the instruments are slide-rules and calculating machines. But instead of waving a baton he turns a beam of rosy light upon any region that is running ahead of the rest, and a beam of blue light upon those who are behindhand.
Four senior clerks in the central pulpit are collecting the future weather as fast as it is being computed, and despatching it by pneumatic carrier to a quiet room. There it will be coded and telephoned to the radio transmitting station. Messengers carry piles of used computing forms down to a storehouse in the cellar.
In a neighbouring building there is a research department, where they invent improvements. But there is much experimenting on a small scale before any change is made in the complex routine of the computing theatre. In a basement an enthusiast is observing eddies in the liquid lining of a huge spinning bowl, but so far the arithmetic proves the better way. In another building are all the usual financial, correspondence and administrative offices. Outside are playing fields, houses, mountains and lakes, for it was thought that those who compute the weather should breathe of it freely. (Richardson 1922)

In 1950, when Richardson received news of the first weather forecast by the first modern computer, ENIAC, he called it an &quot;enormous scientific advance&quot;. The first calculations for a 24-hour forecast took ENIAC nearly 24 hours to produce.

Richardson was also interested in atmospheric turbulence and performed many terrestrial experiments. The Richardson number, a dimensionless parameter of the theory of turbulence, is named for him. He famously summarised turbulence in rhyming verse in &quot;Weather Prediction by Numerical Process&quot; (p 66):
&quot;Big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity,&quot;
:&quot;and little whirls have lesser whirls and so on to viscosity.&quot;

[A play on two lines of Augustus De Morgan&#x27;s poem Siphonaptera: &quot;Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite &#x27;em, / And little fleas have lesser fleas, and so &quot;ad infinitum&quot;.&quot; (&quot;A Budget of Paradoxes&quot;, 1915). De Morgan&#x27;s lines themselves reword two lines of Jonathan Swift&#x27;s 1733 satirical poem &quot;On Poetry: A Rapsody&quot;.]

===Richardson&#x27;s attempt at numerical forecast===
One of Richardson&#x27;s most celebrated achievements is his retroactive attempt to forecast the weather during a single day—20 May 1910—by direct computation. At the time, meteorologists made forecasts principally by looking for similar weather patterns from records and extrapolating. Richardson attempted to use a mathematical model of the principal features of the atmosphere, and use data taken at a specific time (7 AM) to calculate the weather six hours later ab initio. As meteorologist Peter Lynch makes clear, Richardson&#x27;s forecast failed dramatically, predicting a huge rise in pressure over six hours when the pressure actually was more or less static. But detailed analysis by Lynch has shown that the cause was a failure to apply smoothing techniques to the data, which rule out unphysical surges in pressure. When these are applied, Richardson&#x27;s forecast is essentially accurate—a remarkable achievement considering the calculations were done by hand while Richardson was serving with the Quaker ambulance unit in France.

==Mathematical analysis of war==

Richardson also applied his mathematical skills in service of his pacifist principles, in particular in understanding the basis of international conflict. For this reason, he is now considered the initiator, or co-initiator (with Quincy Wright and Pitirim Sorokin as well as others such as Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapaport and Adam Curle), of the scientific analysis of conflict—an interdisciplinary topic of quantitative and mathematical social science dedicated to systematic investigation of the causes of war and conditions of peace. As he had done with weather, he analysed war using mainly differential equations and probability theory. Considering the armament of two nations, Richardson posited an idealised system of equations whereby the rate of a nation&#x27;s armament buildup is directly proportional to the amount of arms its rival has and also to the grievances felt toward the rival, and inversely proportional to the amount of arms it already has. Solutions of this system of equations yield insightful conclusions about the nature, and the stability or instability, of various hypothetical conditions that might obtain between nations.

Richardson also originated the theory that the propensity for war between two nations is a function of the length of their common border. And in &quot;Arms and Insecurity&quot; (1949), and &quot;Statistics of Deadly Quarrels&quot; (1960), he sought to analyse the causes of war statistically. Factors he assessed included economics, language, and religion. In the preface of the latter, he wrote: &quot;There is in the world a great deal of brilliant, witty political discussion which leads to no settled convictions. My aim has been different: namely to examine a few notions by quantitative techniques in the hope of reaching a reliable answer.&quot;

In &quot;Statistics of Deadly Quarrels&quot; Richardson presented data on virtually every war from 1815 to 1950, which he categorized using a base 10 logarithmic scale based on the number of battle deaths a conflict produced. In this way, he was the first to observe that the sizes of wars appeared to follow a highly right-skewed Pareto distribution, in which while small conflicts are relatively common, the very largest conflicts are orders of magnitude larger than the &quot;typical&quot; conflict. While conflicts&#x27; sizes can be predicted ahead of time, Richardson showed that the number of international wars per year follows a Poisson distribution. On a smaller scale he showed a similar pattern for gang murders in Chicago and Shanghai, and hypothesized that a universal rule connected the frequency and the size of all &quot;deadly quarrels&quot;.

In the early 21st century, Richardson&#x27;s work on conflict enjoyed a revival among conflict scholars, as his power-law distribution pattern was found in the statistics of several other kinds of conflict, including terrorism and violent mobs, and his work has informed the debate over the durability of the &quot;Long Peace&quot; since 1946. Modern statisticians have shown that while Richardson&#x27;s analyses were not rigorous by modern standards, his statistical conclusions largely hold up: the sizes and frequencies of armed conflicts plausibly follow a power-law pattern, and the rate of new wars is well-modeled by a Poisson distribution.

==Research on the length of coastlines and borders==

Richardson searched for a relation between the probability of two countries going to war and the length of their common border. While collecting data, he found that there was considerable variation in the various published lengths of international borders. For example, that between Spain and Portugal was variously quoted as 987 or 1,214 km, and that between the Netherlands and Belgium as 380 or 449 km.

The reason for these inconsistencies is the &quot;coastline paradox&quot;. Suppose the coast of Britain is measured using a 200–km ruler, specifying that both ends of the ruler must touch the coast. Now cut the ruler in half and repeat the measurement, then repeat:

The smaller the ruler, the longer the resulting coastline. It might be supposed that these values would converge to a number representing the coastline&#x27;s true length, but Richardson demonstrated that this is not so: the measured length of coastlines, and other natural features, increases without limit as the unit of measurement is made smaller. This is known as the &quot;Richardson effect&quot;.

At the time, the scientific community ignored Richardson&#x27;s research. Today it is considered an element of the beginning of the modern study of fractals. Benoît Mandelbrot quotes Richardson&#x27;s research in his 1967 paper How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Richardson identified a value (between 1 and 2) that describes the changes (with increasing measurement detail) in observed complexity for a particular coastline; this value served as a model for the concept of fractal dimension.

==Patents for detection of icebergs==
In April 1912, soon after the loss of the ship &quot;Titanic&quot;, Richardson registered a patent for iceberg detection using acoustic echolocation in air. A month later he registered a similar patent for acoustic echolocation in water, anticipating the invention of sonar by Paul Langevin and Robert Boyle 6 years later.

==In popular culture==
A fictional version of Richardson, named Wallace Ryman, plays a pivotal role in Giles Foden&#x27;s novel &quot;Turbulence&quot;.

Richardson is mentioned in John Brunner&#x27;s book &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot;, where &quot;Statistics of Deadly Quarrels&quot; is used as an argument that wars are inevitable.

Richardson&#x27;s work is also mentioned in Poul Anderson&#x27;s speculative fiction novelette &quot;Kings Who Die&quot;.

Richardson is mentioned in Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;Antkind&quot;.

Richardson&#x27;s couplet &quot;Big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity; little whirls have lesser whirls &amp; so on to viscosity&quot; is mentioned in Lupe Fiasco&#x27;s song &quot;Dots &amp; Lines&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1909, Richardson married Dorothy Garnett, daughter of the mathematician and physicist William Garnett. They were unable to have children due to an incompatibility of blood types, but adopted two sons and a daughter between 1920 and 1927.

Richardson&#x27;s nephew Ralph Richardson became a noted actor. His great-nephew (through his wife Dorothy&#x27;s eldest brother, (James Clerk) Maxwell Garnett), Julian Hunt, became a meteorologist and director general and chief executive of the British Meteorological Office from 1992 to 1997. A great-niece of the same line of descent is the former politician Virginia Bottomley, now Baroness Bottomley.

==Legacy==
Since 1997, the Lewis Fry Richardson Medal has been awarded by the European Geosciences Union for &quot;exceptional contributions to nonlinear geophysics in general&quot; (by EGS until 2003 and by EGU since 2004).
