<doc id="431224" wikidata="Q1778372" url="?curid=431224" title="USS Bainbridge (DD-1)">
<text>The second USS &quot;Bainbridge&quot; was the first destroyer, also called &quot;Torpedo-boat destroyers&quot;, in the United States Navy and the lead ship of the . She was named for William Bainbridge. &quot;Bainbridge&quot; was commissioned 12 February 1903. She served in the Asiatic Fleet before World War I and served in patrol and convoy duty during the war. She was decommissioned 3 July 1919.

==Construction==
&quot;Bainbridge&quot; was laid down on 15 August 1899, by Neafie and Levy Ship and Engine Building Company at their shipyard in Philadelphia, as one of nine ships built to a design by the US Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair. Although the name-ship of her class, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; was not the first ship of the class to be laid down or completed. &quot;Bainbridge&quot; was launched on 27 August 1901. She was placed in reserve commission at Philadelphia on 24 November 1902, with Lieutenant G. W. Williams in command, and towed to Norfolk, Virginia. She was placed in full commission on 12 February 1903. The cost for the hull and machinery was $283,000.

The &quot;Bainbridge&quot;-class design was intended to combine high speed with improved seaworthiness, and had a raised forecastle instead of the &quot;turtleback&quot; forecastle common in European designs. The hull was long overall and between the perpendiculars, with a beam of and a mean draft of . Design displacement was and full load, although all ships of the class, including &quot;Bainbridge&quot; were overweight, with &quot;Bainbridge&quot; displacing full load when completed. &quot;Bainbridge&quot; was powered by triple expansion steam engines rated at , fed by four Thornycroft boilers which raised steam at . Design speed was , she reached a speed of during sea trials. Four funnels were fitted. Armament consisted of two /50 caliber guns, five 6-pounder () guns and two torpedo tubes.

==Service history==
===First commissioning===
Assigned to the 1st Torpedo Flotilla, she spent the next three months completing trials and outfitting. On 1 June 1903, her flotilla made the trip to Annapolis, Maryland, where it became part of the North Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s recently formed Coast Squadron. A week later, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; left Annapolis with the Flotilla and the Coast Squadron and headed south to Newport News, Virginia. The destroyer and her traveling companions set out on 18 June for a summer of drills and exercises in New England waters. Those evolutions consisted of a search problem followed by joint maneuvers with units of the Army, most of which took place along the coast of Maine. Detached from the Coast Squadron on 26 September 1903, the 1st Torpedo Flotilla returned to Hampton Roads to fit out for service on the Asiatic Station.

Following weeks of preparation, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; stood out of Chesapeake Bay and headed south with the rest of the 1st Torpedo Flotilla and on 12 December 1903. After stops in South Carolina at Charleston and Parris Island, the little convoy arrived at Key West, Florida, on 18 December. The auxiliary cruiser relieved &quot;Baltimore&quot; as the flotilla&#x27;s escort for the remainder of the journey to the Far East.

===Transfer to the Far East===
Setting out on 23 December 1903, the flotilla proceeded by way of Puerto Rico and the Canary Islands to Gibraltar where it arrived on 27 January 1904. Resuming the voyage on 31 January, the warships stopped at Algiers for a week in early February. On 9 February, they arrived at Valletta, Malta, where the flotilla and &quot;Buffalo&quot; had to lay over for a fortnight while went into dry dock to have her propellers repaired after damaging them while mooring. Transiting the Suez Canal on 26 February, the flotilla stayed at Port Suez, Egypt, until the 29th when it headed down the Red Sea to Aden. In March, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and her companions visited Bombay, India, and Colombo, Ceylon. They made the last stop before reaching their destination, a port call at Singapore, between 3 and 9 April. The flotilla then made the relatively short final leg of the voyage, from Singapore to Cavite in the Philippines, on 9 April 1904.

===Far East duty===
Their successful completion of the four-month voyage from the east coast to the Orient did much to prove torpedo-boat destroyers capable of extended operations at sea with the fleet. The manner in which she and her colleagues served on the Asiatic Station, alternating between duty in Chinese waters and service in the Philippines, further substantiated their utility and hinted at their ultimate versatility. Less than seven weeks after arriving in the Philippines, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; led the flotilla, she wore the flotilla commander&#x27;s flag, out of Manila Bay on its way to its first tour of duty in China. The warships spent June and early July at Hong Kong, making the passage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on 11 July. For the rest of the summer, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and the other destroyers joined the Asiatic Fleet&#x27;s Battleship Squadron in gun and torpedo drills off the Chinese coast and spent much time showing the flag in Chinese ports.

The latter employment, supporting American diplomatic presence in China, had taken on an increasing importance as the Imperial Chinese government&#x27;s effectiveness degenerated in the course of the nineteenth century and during the early years of the twentieth century. Foreign governments felt compelled to send naval forces to provide protection for their nationals conducting all sorts of business in China but then used this need as a pretext to extort quasi-colonial concessions from the prostrate nation. As a result, the Great Powers entered into a fierce competition for political and economic advantage in China. &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and her flotilla-mates served as a part of American diplomacy&#x27;s effort both to maintain Chinese sovereignty and to keep access open to American interests in China.

===Russo-Japanese War===
This, her first, tour of duty in China coincided with one of the several occasions when the friction over benefits in China created enough heat to burst into the flames of war. Earlier in the year, war between Japan and Russia began with Japan&#x27;s attack on the Russian squadron at Port Arthur. Unable to bottle the Russian ships up securely in Port Arthur or to lure them out to their destruction, the Japanese set about investing their base. After several months, the siege forced the Russian squadron to attempt the run to Vladivostok on 10 August 1904. Japanese mines sank or damaged several Russian ships; and, in the ensuing confusion, some Russian ships were separated from the main body before it retired back into Port Arthur to its ultimate doom. Thus, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; found herself at Shanghai when , one of the refugees from Admiral Vitgeft&#x27;s squadron, sought sanctuary there. When her pursuers sent a destroyer into the Yangtze to reconnoiter &quot;Askold&quot;, Rear Admiral Yates Stirling dispatched &quot;Bainbridge&quot; to deter the probe and to discourage a repetition of the high-handed Japanese behavior at Chefoo where they had violated international law by seizing another refugee from Vitgeft&#x27;s squadron after she had interned herself in the neutral port. The ploy succeeded. The Japanese chose to allow &quot;Askold&quot; to intern herself, and the Russian commander wisely did so.

Following that incident, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; spent another two months in Chinese waters before departing Shanghai on 4 October. She and her flotilla-mates then passed three weeks at Hong Kong before resuming the voyage to the Philippines on 26 October. The destroyer reached Cavite on 28 October and spent the remainder of 1904 and the first few weeks of 1905 engaged in local operations, mostly torpedo drills and gunnery practice. In March 1905, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and the destroyer flotilla left the Philippines with the Battleship Squadron for dry docking in Hong Kong. She returned to Manila with those units early in April, and the destroyers received orders to head &quot;south to patrol the coast of Palawan and the waters north of Borneo...&quot; These orders came in response to reports that Russian Rear Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky&#x27;s Baltic Fleet had finally set sail after a three-month layover at Madagascar to complete its voyage to join the war in the Far East. &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and her colleagues spent the next few months guarding the American Philippines against neutrality violations by the Russians and the Japanese. This danger effectively evaporated with the nearly complete destruction of the Russian Baltic Fleet by Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō at the Battle of Tsushima on 27 and 28 May.

===&quot;Show the flag&quot; – China 1905–1906===
On 1 July 1905, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; stood out of Manila Bay with the flotilla to accompany the battleship and cruiser squadrons on the annual northern redeployment to conduct summer exercises and to &quot;show the flag&quot; in Chinese waters. The first portion of the normal summer drills and port visits went off as usual; but, early in August, China displayed another burst of nationalism when a boycott was organized in response to the Chinese exclusion policy then in effect on the American west coast. Initially, this brought little disruption to the Asiatic Fleet&#x27;s routine. The warships carried out their exercises and visited Chinese ports as usual. The destroyers even returned south to the Philippines in October according to custom. Only then came the break with normal routine. Instead of passing the winter months in the Philippines, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and &quot;Barry&quot; spent just six weeks there before returning north to China late in November after President Theodore Roosevelt chose to brandish the &quot;Big Stick&quot;.

The mission lasted through the winter with the destroyers joining other ships of the Asiatic Fleet in repeated calls at Chinese ports in a vigorous display of the naval might of the United States. By the spring of 1906, the Chinese national feeling against the United States had subsided so that, though &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and &quot;Barry&quot; remained in Chinese waters and continued to &quot;show the flag,&quot; they were also able to resume many of the normal training evolutions more typical of their annual summer sojourns in Chinese waters. Her stay in northern waters thus continued through the summer and into the fall. At the end of September, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and &quot;Barry&quot; left Chefoo, China, in company with to return to the Philippines for the first time since the previous fall. After stopping off at Amoy, China, from 3 to 8 October, the warships arrived back at Cavite on the 10th.

===First decommissioning===
On 9 January 1907, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; was placed out of commission at the Cavite Navy Yard to undergo repairs to her machinery. Problems with the boilers in the new destroyers had been reported as early as 1905 when the Asiatic Fleet commander&#x27;s report alluded to the need to retube them as soon as circumstances allowed. The repairs appear to have staggered, no doubt to allow some of the flotilla to remain active and possibly because of limited yard facilities. Three of them; , and had been out of commission at Cavite since early December 1905. Presumably, &quot;Bainbridge&quot;″s decommissioning date had been arranged to nearly coincide with &quot;Chauncey&quot;″s return to active duty on 12 January 1907. &quot;Bainbridge&quot; remained out of service at Cavite for nearly 14 months before being recommissioned on 2 April 1908, Ens. Joseph V. Ogan in command.
===Second commissioning − Xinhai Revolution===
For three years after her return to active service, the warship carried out a normal routine for Asiatic Fleet destroyers unburdened by extraordinary diplomatic demands. This meant drilling and patrolling in the Philippines each winter followed by exercises conducted in Chinese waters in the summer. Near the end of the 1911 summer cruise, however, events transpired to upset this pattern. Disturbances in China in September and early October 1911 led to an anti-Manchu revolt which grew into the revolution that toppled the dynasty in 1912. This sequence of events kept &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and the other destroyers from returning to the Philippines from north China in the fall of 1911. Instead, they remained in Chinese waters, where they were soon joined by every available Asiatic Fleet ship, to protect Americans and their interests in China through the winter and into the spring of 1912.

===Second decommissioning===
Still, by the spring of 1912, the remarkable restraint that both factions in the struggle for power in China displayed toward foreign lives and rights allowed much of the recently assembled foreign naval might to stand down. Accordingly, though some of her sisters stayed on station in the Yangtze River, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; headed back to the Philippines. Her return coincided with, and may have been caused in part by, a widespread manpower shortage that forced a number of torpedo boats and destroyers into a form of caretaker status. Upon her return from China, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; was placed in reserve on 24 April 1912.

===Third commissioning===

&quot;Bainbridge&quot; remained in this semi-active state for almost a year, resuming full active duty on 1 April 1913, with Lieutenant (junior grade), later Admiral, Raymond A. Spruance in command.

Though she became fully active once again, complications on the international scene still held her back from the old comfortable routine. In mid-April, the diplomatic crisis over the California Alien Land Law of 1913 arose with Japan and forestalled the usual summer deployment to Chinese waters. Instead, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and the rest of the flotilla stayed close by Luzon as part of the defenses for Manila Bay in the event of a war. The situation eased considerably by the end of May, but the destroyers kept close to their Philippine base all during the summer and fall of 1913 and through the winter of 1913 and 1914. Circumstances seemed to change later because Bainbridge and her division mates sailed off on the familiar cruise to north China in the summer of 1914. That tour of duty, however, did not signal a return to the schedule of old but, instead, proved to be the last of those regular summer journeys north in the Far East. In 1915, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; made a short deployment to Shanghai but it came late in the fall, November and December, rather than in the summer and it was her last visit to China. She and her sisters spent all of 1916 patrolling in the Philippines and continued so engaged during the first three months of 1917. Even the entry of the United States into World War I in the spring of 1917, which found &quot;Bainbridge&quot; moored at Cebu in the southern islands, did not disrupt her schedule of Philippine operations immediately. Only in mid-summer 1917 did orders arrive sending her and her sisters to duty in European waters.

===World War I===
On 1 August 1917, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; stood out of Cavite with the rest of her division and embarked on the long voyage to Europe. She steamed by way of Borneo, Singapore, Ceylon, and India, making extended pauses at Columbo, Ceylon, where the division had to wait for &quot;Barry&quot; to repair a damaged propeller, and at Bombay, India, before reaching the southern terminus of the Suez Canal on 23 September. The division transited the canal on 25 September arriving at Port Said, Egypt, early in the afternoon. After a week at Port Said, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; headed across the Mediterranean with the division. Although they had yet to reach their base of operations, the destroyers really began their war service upon entering the Mediterranean Sea where German and Austro-Hungarian submarines based on the Dalmatian coast were highly active. &quot;Bainbridge&quot;, in fact, claimed her only submarine contact just a week after departing Port Said on her way to Gibraltar. She had steamed with the division to Malta, arriving in Valletta on 6 October and leaving again the following day escorting some ships to Naples. On the 8th, her lookouts spied a U-boat on the surface stalking one of her charges, SS &quot;Camilla Rickmers&quot;, and &quot;Bainbridge&quot; charged to the attack. Before she could close the target to within gun range, however, the submarine submerged and escaped. On the 9th, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; and her division mates saw the merchant ships safely into Naples where they stood down for almost a week. She and her colleagues stood out of Naples on the last leg of their voyage on 15 October and reached their new base at Gibraltar on the 20th.

The warship served nine months in the European war zone based at Gibraltar escorting Allied shipping into and out of the Mediterranean Sea and between various points on the western Mediterranean littoral. On 15 July 1918, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; departed Gibraltar in company with to return to the United States. Sailing by way of the Azores and Bermuda, the two warships reached Charleston, S.C., on 3 August. She operated out of Charleston, carrying out a variety of patrol and escort missions, until 27 November when she set out for Boston. The destroyer served along the northeastern coast until the summer of 1919.

===Final decommissioning and fate===
On 3 July 1919, &quot;Bainbridge&quot; was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September 1919. She was sold to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company, of Philadelphia, on 3 January 1920 for conversion to mercantile service as a fruit carrier.

<text>Sawflies are wasp-like insects that are in the suborder Symphyta within the order Hymenoptera, alongside ants, bees, and wasps. The common name comes from the saw-like appearance of the ovipositor, which the females use to cut into the plants where they lay their eggs. The name is associated especially with the Tenthredinoidea, by far the largest superfamily in the suborder, with about 7,000 known species; in the entire suborder, there are 8,000 described species in more than 800 genera. Symphyta is paraphyletic, consisting of several basal groups within the order Hymenoptera, each one rooted inside the previous group, ending with the Apocrita which are not sawflies.

The primary distinction between sawflies and the Apocrita – the ants, bees, and wasps – is that the adults lack a &quot;wasp waist&quot;, and instead have a broad connection between the abdomen and the thorax. Some sawflies are Batesian mimics of wasps and bees, and the ovipositor can be mistaken for a stinger. Sawflies vary in length, most measuring ; the largest known sawfly measured . The larvae are caterpillar-like, but can be distinguished by the number of prolegs and the absence of crochets in sawfly larvae. The great majority of sawflies are plant-eating, though the members of the superfamily Orussoidea are parasitic.

Predators include birds, insects and small animals. The larvae of some species have anti-predator adaptations such as regurgitating irritating liquid and clustering together for safety in numbers. Sawflies are hosts to many parasitoids, most of which are Hymenoptera, the rest being Diptera.

Adult sawflies are short-lived, with a life expectancy of 7–9 days, though the larval stage can last from months to years, depending on the species. Parthenogenetic females, which do not need to mate to produce fertilised eggs, are common in the suborder, though many species have males. The adults feed on pollen, nectar, honeydew, sap, other insects, including hemolymph of the larvae hosts; they have mouth pieces adapted to these types of feeding.

Sawflies go through a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. The female uses her ovipositor to drill into plant material (or, in the case of Orussoidea, other insects) and then lays eggs in groups called rafts or pods. After hatching, larvae feed on plants, often in groups. As they approach adulthood, the larvae seek a protected spot to pupate, typically in bark or the soil. Large populations of species such as the pine sawfly can cause substantial damage to economic forestry, while others such as the iris sawfly are major pests in horticulture. Outbreaks of sawfly larvae can defoliate trees and may cause dieback, stunting or death. Sawflies can be controlled through the use of insecticides, natural predators and parasitoids, or mechanical methods.

Sawflies first appeared 250 million years ago in the Triassic. The oldest superfamily, the Xyeloidea, has existed into the presents. Over 200million years ago, a lineage of sawflies evolved a parasitoid lifestyle, with carnivorous larvae that ate the eggs or larvae of other insects. Sawflies are distributed globally, though they are more diverse in the northernmost hemispheres.

==Etymology==
The suborder name &quot;Symphyta&quot; derives from the Greek word , meaning &#x27;grown together&#x27;, referring to the group&#x27;s distinctive lack of a wasp waist between prostomium and peristomium. Its common name, &quot;sawfly&quot;, derives from the saw-like ovipositor that is used for egg-laying, in which a female makes a slit in either a stem or plant leaf to deposit the eggs. The first known use of this name was in 1773. Sawflies are also known as &quot;wood-wasps&quot;.

==Phylogeny==
In his original description of Hymenoptera in 1863, German zoologist Carl Gerstaecker divided them into three groups, &quot;Hymenoptera aculeata&quot;, &quot;Hymenoptera apocrita&quot; and &quot;Hymenoptera phytophaga&quot;. However, four years later in 1867, he described just two groups, &quot;H. apocrita&quot; syn. &quot;genuina&quot; and &quot;H. symphyta&quot; syn. &quot;phytophaga&quot;. Consequently, the name Symphyta is given to Gerstaecker as the zoological authority. In his description, Gerstaecker distinguished the two groups by the transfer of the first abdominal segment to the thorax in the Apocrita, compared to the Symphyta. Consequently, there are only eight dorsal half segments in the Apocrita, against nine in the Symphyta. The larvae are distinguished in a similar way.
The Symphyta have therefore traditionally been considered, alongside the Apocrita, to form one of two suborders of Hymenoptera. Symphyta are the more primitive group, with comparatively complete venation, larvae that are largely phytophagous, and without a &quot;wasp-waist&quot;, a symplesiomorphic feature. Together, the Symphyta make up less than 10% of hymenopteran species. While the terms sawfly and Symphyta have been used synonymously, the Symphyta have also been divided into three groups, true sawflies (phyllophaga), woodwasps or xylophaga (Siricidae), and Orussidae. The three groupings have been distinguished by the true sawflies&#x27; ventral serrated or saw-like ovipositor for sawing holes in vegetation to deposit eggs, while the woodwasp ovipositor penetrates wood and the Orussidae behave as external parasitoids of wood-boring beetles. The woodwasps themselves are a paraphyletic ancestral grade. Despite these limitations, the terms have utility and are common in the literature.

While most hymenopteran superfamilies are monophyletic, as is Hymenoptera, the Symphyta has long been seen to be paraphyletic. Cladistic methods and molecular phylogenetics are improving the understanding of relationships between the superfamilies, resulting in revisions at the level of superfamily and family. The Symphyta are the most primitive (basal) taxa within the Hymenoptera (some going back 250 million years), and one of the taxa within the Symphyta gave rise to the monophyletic suborder Apocrita (wasps, bees, and ants). In cladistic analyses the Orussoidea are consistently the sister group to the Apocrita.

The oldest unambiguous sawfly fossils date back to the Middle or Late Triassic. These fossils, from the family Xyelidae, are the oldest of all Hymenoptera. One fossil, &quot;Archexyela ipswichensis&quot; from Queensland is between 205.6 and 221.5million years of age, making it among the oldest of all sawfly fossils. More Xyelid fossils have been discovered from the Middle Jurassic and the Cretaceous, but the family was less diverse then than during the Mesozoic and Tertiary. The subfamily Xyelinae were plentiful during these time periods, in which Tertiary faunas were dominated by the tribe Xyelini; these are indicative of a humid and warm climate.

The cladogram is based on Schulmeister 2003.

=== Taxonomy ===

There are approximately 8,000 species of sawfly in more than 800 genera, although new species continue to be discovered. However, earlier studies indicated that 10,000 species grouped into about 1,000 genera were known. Early phylogenies such as that of Alexandr Rasnitsyn, based on morphology and behaviour, identified nine clades which did not reflect the historical superfamilies. Such classifications were replaced by those using molecular methods, starting with Dowton and Austin (1994). As of 2013, the Symphyta are treated as nine superfamilies (one extinct) and 25 families. Most sawflies belong to the Tenthredinoidea superfamily, with about 7,000 species worldwide. Tenthredinoidea has six families, of which Tenthredinidae is by far the largest with some 5,500 species.

==Description==

Many species of sawfly have retained their ancestral attributes throughout time, specifically their plant-eating habits, wing veins and the unmodified abdomen, where the first two segments appear like the succeeding segments. The absence of the narrow wasp waist distinguishes sawflies from other members of hymenoptera, although some are Batesian mimics with similar to wasps and bees, and the ovipositor can be mistaken for a stinger. Most sawflies are stubby and soft-bodied, and fly weakly. Sawflies vary in length: &quot;Urocerus gigas&quot;, which can be mistaken as a wasp due to its black-and-yellow striped body, can grow up to in length, but among the largest sawflies ever discovered was &quot;Hoplitolyda duolunica&quot; from the Mesozoic, with a body length of and a wingspan of . The smaller species only reach lengths of .

Heads of sawflies vary in size, shape and sturdiness, as well as the positions of the eyes and antennae. They are characterised in four head types: open head, maxapontal head, closed head and genapontal head. The open head is simplistic, whereas all the other heads are derived. The head is also hypognathous, meaning that the lower mouthparts are directed downwards. When in use, the mouthparts may be directed forwards, but this is only caused when the sawfly swings its entire head forward in a pendulum motion. Unlike most primitive insects, the sutures (rigid joints between two or more hard elements on an organism) and sclerites (hardened body parts) are obsolescent or absent. The clypeus (a sclerite that makes up an insects &quot;face&quot;) is not divided into a pre- and postclypeus, but rather separated from the front. The antennal sclerites are fused with the surrounding head capsule, but these are sometimes separated by a suture. The number of segments in the antennae vary from six in the Accorduleceridae to 30 or more in the Pamphiliidae. The compound eyes are large with a number of facets, and there are three ocelli between the dorsal portions of the compound eyes. The tentorium comprises the whole inner skeleton of the head.

Three segments make up the thorax: the mesothorax, metathorax and prothorax, as well as the exoskeletal plates that connect with these segments. The legs have spurs on their fourth segments, the tibiae. Sawflies have two pairs of translucent wings. The fore and hind wings are locked together with hooks. Parallel development in sawfly wings is most frequent in the anal veins. In all sawflies, 2A and 3A tend to fuse with the first anal vein. This occurs in several families including Argidae, Diprionidae and Cimbicidae.

The larvae of sawflies are easily mistaken for lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars). However, several morphological differences can distinguish the two: while both larvae share three pairs of thoracic legs and an apical pair of abdominal prolegs, lepidopteran caterpillars have four pairs of prolegs on abdominal segments 3–6 while sawfly larvae have five pairs of prolegs located on abdominal segments 2–6; crochets are present on lepidopteran larvae, whereas on sawfly larvae they are not; the prolegs of both larvae gradually disappear by the time they burrow into the ground, therefore making it difficult to distinguish the two; and sawfly larvae only have a single pair of minute eyes, whereas lepidopteran larvae have four to six eyes on each side of the head. Sawfly larvae behave like lepidopteran larvae, walking about and eating foliage. Some groups have larvae that are eyeless and almost legless; these larvae make tunnels in plant tissues including wood. Many species of sawfly larvae are strikingly coloured, exhibiting colour combinations such as black and white while others are black and yellow. This is a warning colouration because some larvae can secrete irritating fluids from glands located on their undersides.

== Distribution ==
Sawflies are widely distributed throughout the world. The largest family, the Tenthredinidae, with some 5,000 species, are found on all continents except Antarctica, though they are most abundant and diverse in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere; they are absent from New Zealand and there are few of them in Australia. The next largest family, the Argidae, with some 800 species, is also worldwide, but is most common in the tropics, especially in Africa, where they feed on woody and herbaceous angiosperms. Of the other families, the Blasticotomidae and Megalodontidae are Palearctic; the Xyelidae, Pamphilidae, Diprionidae, Cimbicidae, and Cephidae are Holarctic, while the Siricidae are mainly Holarctic with some tropical species. The parasitic Orussidae are found worldwide, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The wood-boring Xiphydriidae are worldwide, but most species live in the subtropical parts of Asia.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Sawflies are mostly herbivores, feeding on plants that have a high concentration of chemical defences. These insects are either resistant to the chemical substances, or they avoid areas of the plant that have high concentrations of chemicals. The larvae primarily feed in groups; they are folivores, eating plants and fruits on native trees and shrubs, though some are parasitic. However, this is not always the case; Monterey pine sawfly (&quot;Itycorsia&quot;) larvae are solitary web-spinners that feed on Monterey pine trees inside a silken web. The adults feed on pollen and nectar.

Sawflies are eaten by a wide variety of predators. While many birds find the larvae distasteful, some such as the currawong (&quot;Strepera&quot;) and stonechats (&quot;Saxicola&quot;) eat both adults and larvae. The larvae are an important food source for the chicks of several birds, including partridges. Sawfly and moth larvae form one third of the diet of nestling corn buntings (&quot;Emberiza calandra&quot;), with sawfly larvae being eaten more frequently on cool days. Black grouse (&quot;Tetrao tetrix&quot;) chicks show a strong preference for sawfly larvae. Sawfly larvae formed 43% of the diet of chestnut-backed chickadees (&quot;Poecile rufescens&quot;). Small carnivorous mammals such as the masked shrew (&quot;Sorex cinereus&quot;), the northern short-tailed shrew (&quot;Blarina brevicauda&quot;) and the deer mouse (&quot;Peromyscus maniculatus&quot;) predate heavily on sawfly cocoons. Insects such as ants and certain species of predatory wasps (&quot;Vespula vulgaris&quot;) eat adult sawflies and the larvae, as do lizards and frogs. Pardalotes, honeyeaters and fantails (&quot;Rhipidura&quot;) occasionally consume laid eggs, and several species of beetle larvae prey on the pupae.

The larvae have several anti-predator adaptations. While adults are unable to sting, the larvae of species such as the spitfire sawfly regurgitate a distasteful irritating liquid, which makes predators such as ants avoid the larvae. In some species, the larvae cluster together, reducing their chances of being killed, and in some cases form together with their heads pointing outwards or tap their abdomens up and down. Some adults bear black and yellow markings that mimic wasps.

===Parasites===
Sawflies are hosts to many parasitoids, most of which are parasitic Hymenoptera; more than 40 species are known to attack them. However, information regarding these species is minimal, and fewer than 10 of these species actually cause a significant impact on sawfly populations. Many of these species attack their hosts in the grass or in other parasitoids. Well known and important parasitoids include Braconidae, Eulophidae and Ichneumonidae. Braconid wasps attack sawflies in many regions throughout the world, in which they are ectoparasitoids, meaning that the larvae live and feed outside of the hosts body; braconids have more of an impact on sawfly populations in the New World than they do in the Old World, possibly because there are no ichneumonid parasitoids in North America. Some braconid wasps that attack sawflies include &quot;Bracon cephi&quot;, &quot;B. lisogaster&quot;, &quot;B. terabeila&quot; and &quot;Heteropilus cephi&quot;. Female braconids locate sawfly larvae through the vibrations they produce when feeding, followed by inserting the ovipostior and paralysing the larva before laying eggs inside the host. These eggs hatch inside the larva within a few days, where they feed on the host. The entire host&#x27;s body may be consumed by the braconid larvae, except for the head capsule and epidermis. The larvae complete their development within two or three weeks.

Ten species of wasps in the family Ichneumonidae attack sawfly populations, although these species are usually rare. The most important parasitoids in this family are species in the genus &quot;Collyria&quot;. Unlike braconids, the larvae are endoparasitoids, meaning that the larvae live and feed inside the hosts body. One well known ichneumonid is &quot;Collyria coxator&quot;, which is a dominant parasitoid of &quot;C. pygmaeus&quot;. Recorded parasitism rates in Europe are between 20–76%, and as many as eight eggs can be found in a single larva, but only one &quot;Collyria&quot; individual will emerge from its host. The larva may remain inside of their host until spring, where it emerges and pupates.

Several species in the family Eulophidae attack sawflies, although their impact is low. Two species in the genus &quot;Pediobius&quot; have been studied; the two species are internal larval parasitoids and have only been found in the northern hemisphere. Parasitism of sawflies by eulophids in grass exceeds 50%, but only 5% in wheat. It is unknown as to why the attack rate in wheat is low. Furthermore, some fungal and bacterial diseases are known to infect eggs and pupa in warm wet weather.

Outbreaks of certain sawfly species, such as &quot;Diprion polytomum&quot;, have led scientists to investigate and possibly collect their natural enemies to control them. Parasites of &quot;D. polytomum&quot; have been extensively investigated, showing that 31 species of hymenopterous and dipterous parasites attack it. These parasites have been used in successful biological control against pest sawflies, including &quot;Cephus cinctus&quot; throughout the 1930s and 1950s and &quot;C. pygmaeus&quot; in the 1930s and 1940s.

===Life cycle and reproduction===
Like all other hymenopteran insects, sawflies go through a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. Many species are parthenogenetic, meaning that females do not need fertilization to create viable eggs. Unfertilized eggs develop as male, while fertilized eggs develop into females (arrhenotoky). The lifespan of an individual sawfly is two months to two years, though the adult life stage is often very short (approximately 7 – 9 days), only long enough for the females to lay their eggs. The female uses its ovipositor to drill into plant material to lay her eggs (though the family Orussoidea lay their eggs in other insects). Plant-eating sawflies most commonly are associated with leafy material but some specialize on wood, and the ovipositors of these species (such as the family Siricidae) are specially adapted for the task of drilling through bark. Once the incision has been made, the female will lay as many as 30 to 90 eggs. Females avoid the shade when laying their eggs because the larvae develop much slower and may not even survive, and they may not also survive if they are laid on immature and glaucous leaves. Hence, female sawflies search for young adult leaves to lay their eggs on.

These eggs hatch in two to eight weeks, but such duration varies by species and also by temperature. Until the eggs have hatched, some species such as the small brown sawfly will remain with them and protects the eggs by buzzing loudly and beating her wings to deter predators. There are six larval stages that sawflies go through, lasting 2 – 4 months, but this also depends on the species. When fully grown, the larvae emerge from the trees en masse and burrow themselves into the soil to pupate. During their time outside, the larvae may link up to form a large colony if many other individuals are present. They gather in large groups during the day which gives them protection from potential enemies, and during the night they disperse to feed. The emergence of adults takes awhile, with some emerging anywhere between a couple months to 2 years. Some will reach the ground to form pupal chambers, but others may spin a cocoon attached to a leaf. Larvae that feed on wood will pupate in the tunnels they have constructed. In one species, the jumping-disc sawfly (&quot;Phyllotoma aceris&quot;) forms a cocoon which can act like a parachute. The larvae live in sycamore trees and do not damage the upper or lower cuticles of leaves that they feed on. When fully developed, they cut small perforations in the upper cuticle to form a circle. After this, they weave a silk hammocks within the circle; this silk hammock never touches the lower cuticle. Once inside, the upper-cuticle&#x27;s disc separates and descends towards the surface with the larvae attaching themselves to the hammock. Once they reach the round, the larvae work their way into a sheltered area by jerking their discs along.

The majority of sawfly species produce a single generation per year, but others may only have one generation every two years. Most sawflies are also female, making males rare.

==Relationship with humans==

Sawflies are major economic pests of forestry. Species in the Diprionidae, such as the pine sawflies, &quot;Diprion pini&quot; and &quot;Neodiprion sertifer&quot;, cause serious damage to pines in regions such as Scandinavia. &quot;D. pini&quot; larvae defoliated in the largest outbreak in Finland, between 1998 and 2001. Up to 75% of the trees may die after such outbreaks, as &quot;D. pini&quot; can remove all the leaves late in the growing season, leaving the trees too weak to survive the winter. Little damage to trees only occurs when the tree is large or when there is minimal presence of larvae. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; trees can regenerate quickly from damage inflicted by the larvae; however, they can be substantially damaged from outbreaks, especially if they are young. The trees can be defoliated completely and may cause &quot;dieback&quot;, stunting or even death.

Sawflies are serious pests in horticulture. Different species prefer different host plants, often being specific to a family or genus of hosts. For example, Iris sawfly larvae, emerging in summer, can quickly defoliate species of &quot;Iris&quot; including the yellow flag and other freshwater species. Similarly the rose sawflies, &quot;Arge pagana&quot; and &quot;A. ochropus&quot;, defoliate rose bushes.

The giant woodwasp or horntail, &quot;Urocerus gigas&quot;, has a long ovipositor, which with its black and yellow colouration make it a good mimic of a hornet. Despite the alarming appearance, the insect cannot sting. The eggs are laid in the wood of conifers such as Douglas fir, pine, spruce, and larch. The larvae eat tunnels in the wood, causing economic damage.

Alternative measures to control sawflies can be taken. Small-scale, mechanical methods include visually confirming larval presence on a plant and subsequently removing them, either by pruning damaged leaves or removing the larvae from the leaves they are on. Larvae typically try to remain hidden on the underside of foliage. Upon removing larvae and/or the affected leaves from plants, they may be dispatched by squishing, or, alternatively, the cut leaves with larvae still attached may be fed to birds; if larger animals do not prey upon them, other insects will. However, this is not practical or useful for some, thus the larvae can be quickly dispatched by simply dropping foliage into a vessel of plain or saltwater, diluted hydrogen peroxide or isopropyl alcohol, insecticidal soap, or other garden chemical. In large-scale, industrial settings, where beneficial insect predators can also be used to eliminate larvae, as well as parasites, which have both been previously used in control programs. Small trees can be sprayed with a number of chemicals, including maldison, dimethoate, carbaryl, imidacloprid, etc., if removing larvae from trees is not effective enough.

<text>Naadam (Mongolian Naadam Festival) (, classical Mongolian: &quot;Naɣadum&quot;, , &quot;literally &quot;games&quot;&quot;) is a traditional festival celebrated in Mongolia, Inner Mongolia and Tuva. The festival is also locally termed &quot;eriin gurvan naadam&quot; (), &quot;the three games of men&quot;. 

The games are Mongolian wrestling, horse racing, and archery, and are held throughout the country during midsummer. Women have started participating in the archery and girls in the horse-racing games, but not in Mongolian wrestling.

In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO.

==Overview==
=== Origins ===
Naadam is the most widely watched festival among Mongols and is believed to have existed for centuries in one fashion or another. It has its origin in the activities, such as military parades and sporting competitions such as archery, horse riding and wrestling, that followed the celebration of various occasions, including weddings or spiritual gatherings. It later served as a way to train soldiers for battle and was also connected to Mongols&#x27; nomadic lifestyle. Mongolians practice their unwritten holiday rules that include a long song to start the holiday, then a &quot;Biyelgee&quot; dance. Traditional cuisine, or &quot;Khuushuur&quot;, is served around the Sports Stadium along with a special drink made of fermented horse milk (&quot;airag&quot;). The three games of wrestling, horse racing, and archery are recorded in the 13th-century book &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;. During the Qing dynasty&#x27;s rule, Naadam became a festival officially held by sums.

It began to be held annually in 1639 with a dance festival dedicated to the High Saint Zanabazar. In this festival of Shireet White Lake, Bokh Lama won in wrestling, and Bonkhor Donir&#x27;s horse won the championship.

In 1772, a great festival was held to worship Khentii mountain. It is called the Festival of Ten Governments. In 1912, the Ten Government Games, which used to be played with losing points, became an annual state game. Until the death of Bogd Khan in 1925, the Ten Government Festival became a state festival. Ten Government Games have been held 125 times.

=== Communist era ===
Naadam during the period of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic was associated with the Mongolian Revolution of 1921. The first official military parade in Communist Mongolia took place in 1921 in honor of the victories of Damdin Sükhbaatar in the revolution. It was celebrated as a Buddhist/shaman holiday until secularization in the 1930s under the Communist influence of the Soviet Union.

The anniversary parades of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Army on Sükhbaatar Square were generally held on jubilee years (specifically in 1946, 1951, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986 and 1991), alongside the International Workers Day and October Revolution Day parades. General T. Galsan was the longtime commander these parades. During these events, party and government leaders viewed the events from the top of Sükhbaatar&#x27;s Mausoleum. After 1991, the communist practice was abandoned with the exception of 1996 when a parade in the National Sports Stadium commemorated the 790th anniversary of the founding of Mongolia and the 75th anniversary of the revolution. 

Many of the celebrations were celebrated with the participation of foreign communists who visited the country, including Mikhail Suslov, Józef Cyrankiewicz, and Władysław Gomułka.

=== Modern celebrations and traditions ===
The two largest Naadams held in Mongolia today are the Danshig Naadam and the National Naadam. The former was only instituted as an annual event in 2015, having previously been held irregularly and commemorates Mongolia&#x27;s independence from the Qing dynasty, and also coincides with Mongolian State Flag Day. The latter formally commemorates the 1921 Revolution a decade later, when communist invaded and deposed Bogd Khan, spillover from the Russian Civil War. Naadam also celebrates the achievements of the new state.
Naadam is also celebrated in different regions of Mongolia and Inner Mongolia in July and August. In the Tuva Republic, Naadam is on 15 August.

The three sports are called Danshig games. They became the great celebration of the new nation, where the nobility got together to dedicate to the Bogd Khan (Jabzundamba Khutugtu), the new head of state.

Genghis Khan&#x27;s nine horse tails, representing the nine tribes of the Mongols, are still ceremonially transported from Sukhbaatar Square to the Stadium to open the Naadam festivities. At the opening and closing ceremonies, there are impressive parades of mounted cavalry, athletes and monks, alongside elements of uniformed organizations.

Another popular Naadam activity is the playing of games using &quot;shagai,&quot; sheep anklebones that serve as game pieces and tokens of both divination and friendship. In the larger Naadam festivals, tournaments may take place in a separate venue. 

Recently, concerns have been raised about the perceived corruption of the festival and its ambiguous symbolism. 

==== National Naadam Festival ====
Alongside the Danshig Naadam, the biggest festival is the National Naadam Festival, which is held in the Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar, during the National Holiday from 11 to 13 July, in the National Sports Stadium. It begins with an elaborate introduction ceremony featuring dancers, athletes, horse riders, and musicians. After the ceremony, the competitions begin. The competitions are mainly horseback riding.

==Three games==

===Wrestling===
A total of 512 or 1024 wrestlers meet in a single-elimination tournament that lasts nine or ten rounds. Mongolian traditional wrestling is an untimed competition in which wrestlers lose if they touch the ground with any part of their body other than their feet or hands. When picking pairs, the wrestler with the greatest fame has the privilege to choose his opponent. Wrestlers wear two-piece costumes consisting of a tight shoulder vest (&quot;zodog&quot;) and shorts (&quot;shuudag&quot;). Only men are allowed to participate.

Each wrestler has an &quot;encourager&quot; called a &quot;zasuul&quot;. The zasuul sings a song of praise for the winning wrestler after rounds 3, 5, and 7. Winners of the 7th or 8th stage (depending on whether the competition features 512 or 1024 wrestlers) earn the title of &quot;zaan&quot;, &quot;elephant&quot;. The winner of the 9th or 10th stage is called &quot;arslan&quot;, &quot;lion&quot;. In the final competition, all the &quot;zasuuls&quot; drop in the wake of each wrestler as they take steps toward each other. Two-time arslans are called the titans / giants, or &quot;avraga&quot;.

===Horse racing===
Unlike Western horse racing, which consists of short sprints generally not much longer than 2 km, Mongolian horse racing as featured in Naadam is a cross-country event, with races 15–30 km long. The length of each race is determined by age class. For example, two-year-old horses race for and seven-year-olds for . Up to 1000 horses from any part of Mongolia can be chosen to participate. Race horses are fed a special diet.

Children from 5 to 13 are chosen as jockeys and train in the months preceding the races. While jockeys are an important component, the main purpose of the races is to test the skill of the horses.

Before the races begin, the audience sings traditional songs and the jockeys sing a song called &quot;Gingo&quot;. Prizes are awarded to horses and jockeys. The top five horses in each class earn the title of and the top three are given gold, silver, and bronze medals. The winning jockey is praised with the title of or leader of ten thousand. The horse that finishes last in the Daaga race (two-year-old horses race) is called (meaning &quot;full stomach&quot;). A song is sung to the wishing him luck to be next year&#x27;s winner.
===Archery===
In this competition both men and women may participate. It is played by teams of ten. Each archer is given four arrows; the team must hit 33 &quot;&quot;surs&quot;.&quot; Men shoot their arrows from 75 meters away while women shoot theirs from 65 meters away. Traditionally the archers wear their national clothing (&quot;Deel&quot;) during the competition. All the archers wear leather bracers up to the elbow on their outstretched arm, so that the &quot;deel&#x27;s&quot; cuff does not interfere with shooting.
Mongolian archery is unique for having dozens of &quot;surs&quot; as targets. Each &quot;sur&quot; is a small woven or wooden cylinder. They are placed on top of each other forming a wall three-high, which is approximately 8 inches high by 5 feet wide. Knocking a &quot;sur&quot; out of the wall with an arrow counts as a hit, though knocking a &quot;sur&quot; out of the centre will bring a competitor more points. When the archer hits the target, the judge says &quot;uuhai&quot; which means &quot;hooray&quot;. After each hit, an official repairs the damaged wall and makes it ready for the next attempt. The winners of the contest are granted the titles of &quot;national marksman&quot; and &quot;national markswoman&quot;.

<doc id="431229" wikidata="Q2395926" url="?curid=431229" title="Folkes Brothers">
<text>The Folkes Brothers are a Jamaican group, composed of John Folkes (the lead singer), Mico Folkes, and Eric Joseph (&quot;Junior&quot;) Folkes, and are the originators of the hit single &quot;Oh Carolina&quot;.

==History==
The group&#x27;s 1961 single &quot;Oh Carolina&quot; was written by John Folkes, the sole author, as established in court in England. 
In 1960, Prince Buster (then a relative unknown who was working as a DJ and bouncer for Duke Reid) approached the legendary Rastafarian percussionist Count Ossie, who had established one of the first Rastafarian camps in Wareika Hill, to record for him. After much encouragement from Prince Buster that he would keep the essence of the Niyabinghi -style drumming intact on the recording, he booked Count Ossie and his drummers along with Owen Gray on piano and Ronnie Bop on bass drum into a small recording studio. Once there, Buster did handclaps and imitated horn riffs while The Folkes Brothers, a trio of teenagers, led by John and backed by his brothers Mico, and Junior, did the back up vocals capturing it in just two takes. It was the only recording the group ever did.

In 1994, John, Eric (Junior ) and Mico Folkes were involved in a legal dispute with Buster over the authorship of the song, after a cover version by Shaggy, who became an international hit. It was eventually ruled by the High Court in London, England, that John Folkes held the copyright. John Folkes assigned the copyright to Greensleeves so that Shaggy&#x27;s &quot;Pure Pleasure&quot; album could be released. This included listing Henry Mancini as co-author, because it was alleged that Shaggy sampled the &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; theme song. It has been noted that John Folkes never agreed to this nor any assignment of the copyright to Greensleeves. This is no longer in dispute.

In 2011, a new group (now consisting Mico Folkes and Eric J. Folkes) recorded an album with their close musician friend, Jah D, in efforts to help promote his studio, while Jah D provided background music for 15 of the Folkes brothers&#x27; songs, solely written by Mico and Eric J. &quot;Junior&quot;. The original group was created by John. As such, he has been the only group member to receive any royalties and his estate is the sole owner of the copyright, as has always been the case.

John Folkes passed away August 29, 2022 at the age of 81, survived by his wife Vilma, and three children Shawn, Paula, and Angel. Junior Folkes passed away January 8, 2024, leaving Mico Folkes the last surviving member of The Folkes Brothers, who has recreated a different group, and has never been entitled to any royalties because Dr. John Folkes (PhD summa cum laude in English from the University of Toronto) is and has always been the sole author.

<doc id="431232" wikidata="Q2291002" url="?curid=431232" title="Pokémon Colosseum">
<text>Pokémon Colosseum is a role-playing video game developed by Genius Sonority and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the GameCube. A spin-off of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, it was released on November 21, 2003 in Japan, March 22, 2004 in North America and May 14, 2004 in Europe. Unlike previous titles&#x27; random encounters with Pokémon, &quot;Colosseum&quot; allows the player to steal (&quot;snag&quot;) the Pokémon of other Pokémon Trainers. The game also features single-player and multiplayer battle modes.

Set in the desert region of Orre, the player controls Wes, a former member of Team Snagem. Throughout the game, Wes rescues &quot;Shadow Pokémon&quot;—Pokémon who have had their hearts darkened by Team Cipher, an antagonistic organization—via snagging. Rui, a non-player character, serves as Wes&#x27;s sidekick and identifies Shadow Pokémon.

&quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot; was exhibited at E3 2003 and featured Pokémon models ported from the Nintendo 64&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot;. North American pre-orders included a bonus disc that allows the player to download the Pokémon Jirachi on the Game Boy Advance titles &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; while Japanese bonus discs featured similar downloads for Celebi and Pikachu. Upon release, the game was a critical and commercial success, with praise directed at its graphics and music. It sold 1.15 million copies in the United States and 656,270 in Japan. Pokémon, &quot;Colosseum&quot; Sold a total of 2.41 million copies worldwide. A successor, &quot;Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness&quot;, released for the GameCube in 2005.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot; is a 3D role-playing game viewed from a third-person perspective. The player, controlling a Pokémon Trainer named Wes (default name), moves through various towns and other locations (traversed using a type of one-wheeled motorcycle), battling enemy Trainers and completing quests. Items are purchased at &quot;Pokémon Mart&quot; locations using the game&#x27;s currency, &quot;Pokémon Dollars&quot; (). When a battle starts, the screen switches to a turn-based interface where the player&#x27;s and enemies&#x27; Pokémon fight. Most battles are of the &quot;double battle&quot; format, which means two Pokémon on each side at one time. However, each Trainer can carry up to six Pokémon at one time, so once a Pokémon is defeated, his or her Trainer must switch out another one unless no more are left. Battles are also conducted at &quot;Colosseums&quot; in several cities.

Unlike most &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, &quot;Colosseum&quot; does not feature random encounters. The player begins the game with two Pokémon. More are obtained throughout the game by &quot;Snagging&quot; them from other Trainers using Poké Balls of various strengths. Only specifically designated &quot;Shadow Pokémon&quot;, whose hearts have been artificially closed, can be Snagged. This contrasts with the normal means of acquiring Pokémon by catching them from the wild in other games. Pokémon can be traded between &quot;Colosseum&quot; and the Game Boy Advance games &quot;Ruby&quot;, &quot;Sapphire&quot;, &quot;FireRed&quot;, &quot;LeafGreen&quot; and &quot;Emerald&quot;.

Each of the player&#x27;s Shadow Pokémon has a purple gauge that is drained by battling and coming to like the player. Once a Pokémon&#x27;s gauge is empty, the player may &quot;Purify&quot; the Pokémon by bringing him or her to Celebi&#x27;s shrine in Agate Village, or by using a rare &quot;Time Flute&quot; item. Purifying Shadow Pokémon is desirable because while in that status, they will often disobey the player, they cannot gain experience points, and their moves are at first restricted to &quot;Shadow Rush&quot;. Additionally, Shadow Pokémon will sporadically enter &quot;Hyper Mode&quot; state during battle, causing them to disobey the player character or attack themselves until the condition is alleviated by selecting the &quot;Call&quot; battle command.

Aside from the story mode, &quot;Colosseum&quot; also features several non-canonical battle modes. In the &quot;Quick Battle&quot; mode, the player can battle either CPU trainers or friends, using Pokémon obtained in the story mode or randomly assigned ones. Battles in this mode do not result in gain of experience points or money. In the single-player battle mode, the player competes at Colosseums—stadiums used throughout the game for Pokémon battles—and earns &quot;Poké Coupons&quot;, another currency which can be used to buy rare items. In the &quot;Gang Battle&quot; mode, up to four players can compete in a tournament. The first can use Pokémon obtained in the story mode, or from the Game Boy Advance games. Players two through four, however, can only use Pokémon from the Game Boy Advance games.

==Plot==
===Setting===
&quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot; is set in the Orre region. Orre is a mostly desertous region in which no wild Pokémon can be found (although the sequel, &quot;Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness&quot;, adds wild Pokémon spots to the region). Orre consists of many cities, towns, and Colosseums.

===Characters===

The game&#x27;s player protagonist is by default named , but as with most &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, the player can change his name. Wes&#x27;s Starter Pokémon are Espeon and Umbreon, two fox-like Pokémon who start at level 25 and 26, respectively. Additionally, shortly after the game begins, the player meets the game&#x27;s partner character, Rui; she accompanies Wes on his journey, and uses her ability to see shadow Pokémon to help combat the efforts of the game&#x27;s villains. , a criminal organization that uses the &quot;Snag machine&quot; technology to capture the Pokémon of Trainers, serves as an antagonistic entity in the game. However, shortly after the game&#x27;s start, is revealed to be the main antagonistic force, having partnered with Snagem to obtain Pokémon from Trainers, corrupting them, and distributing them throughout Cipher and other places such as Pyrite Town. Wes is a former employee of Team Snagem. The organization also employs many grunt workers, as well as four administrators: disco-loving , the explosively-tempered bodybuilder, , the queen of the Under, , and the strategist of a scientist, .

===Story===
The game begins with a cold open in which Wes infiltrates Team Snagem hideout and steals their portable Snag Machine before leaving the organization, blowing up the hideout as he escapes. Wes starts at the Outskirt Stand, a dilapidated train engine in the middle of the desert that has been converted into a shop. With Espeon and Umbreon, Wes&#x27;s first opponent is a Trainer named Willie. After defeating him, Willie then suggests Wes test his skills in the oasis-esque Phenac City nearby. Wes proceeds to Phenac City in time to see two men named Folly and Trudly dragging a sack. After defeating them in battle, Wes unties the sack to find Rui, a girl who was kidnapped because she saw a black aura on a Pokémon. They meet the mayor, Es Cade, and report the incident, and he orders an investigation and suggest they visit Phenac City&#x27;s Colosseum in the mean time.. Upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui. The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent Snagger. Shortly after defeating one of the grunts, Folly and Trudly storm Es Cade&#x27;s house and return with their boss, Miror B. Miror B., however, leaves them to deal with Wes and Rui and Trudly attacks with the Pokémon Rui saw with the black aura. Rui begs Wes to snag it and after defeating them, she asks Wes to join forces with her in finding and snagging the remaining Pokémon with black auras.

After leaving Phenac, he visits Pyrite Town, where Rui was kidnapped. In Pyrite, Wes and Rui find that the black aura Pokémon, known as Shadow Pokémon, are being openly distributed to winners of the town&#x27;s Colosseum tournament by Miror B., who is part of a powerful organization known as Team Cipher. The local police force is powerless to stop the practice, so Wes and Rui see Duking, an influential man in Pyrite who runs the Colosseum. However, Miror B. has kidnapped Duking&#x27;s Plusle to blackmail him into cooperating, so Duking asks Wes to enter the tournament so he can infiltrate Miror B&#x27;s operations. Wes enters the Colosseum challenge and defeats four trainers to win. Inside the nearby Pyrite Building, a Cipher Peon is about to present the Shadow Pokémon prize, but another one recognizes Wes. The pair then battle their way through the building and the maze-like Pyrite Cave set in the rock behind. Eventually, they face and defeat Miror B. and free Plusle, ousting Miror B. from Pyrite. A team of kids working in Duking&#x27;s house introduce themselves as members of an anti-Cipher news network, known as the Kids Grid, who pledge their help to Wes and Rui.

Their next stop is Agate Village, a forested village in the mountains home to many retired trainers including Rui&#x27;s grandparents. As Rui introduces Wes to her grandfather Eagun, another villager runs into the room, telling them that the Relic Stone—a shrine protected by Celebi that can purify Shadow Pokémon—is under attack. Wes, following Eagun to the center of the tree, fights off four Cipher agents before the Relic Stone is safe. Shortly after, Wes receives an e-mail from Duking saying that Mt. Battle, a battling facility built above a volcano, is under attack by Cipher, so Wes and Rui leave to resolve the crisis.

Upon reaching Mt. Battle, Wes and Rui find that Cipher has already taken over the first section of the mountain. After battling nine other Trainers, Wes battles another Cipher Admin, Dakim, who attacks the Area 1 leader Vander because he holds a relic called a Time Flute that has the ability to summon Celebi to the Relic Stone. After defeating Dakim, the Pyrite police chief e-mails Wes saying that he captured two of Miror B.&#x27;s underlings. After returning to the Pyrite Town jail, Wes finds from the underlings that they were arrested trying to sneak into The Under, an underground city located underneath Pyrite Town. Wes swipes a key from one of the underlings and uses it to operate an elevator in Pyrite Building that leads them to The Under. 

Down below, Wes finds that The Under is controlled by another Cipher Admin, Venus, who controls the underground city through TV broadcasts around the city and like Miror B., distributes Shadow Pokémon to the winners of Colosseum challenges. She warns the residents through a broadcast that there are spies among them, making the residents immediately suspicious of them. They also find more members of the Kids Grid are here, who have been cut off from the others because Venus is jamming their signal. After departing from Kids Grid, the residents of The Under claim to have caught a spy, Duking&#x27;s friend Silva. Silva gives Wes and Rui a disk to reach Venus&#x27; studio and Wes and Rui face and defeat her. After Wes confronts Venus she attempts to flee to the Shadow Pokémon Lab, a covert facility in the desert where Pokémon are transformed into Shadow Pokémon, via an underground train. However, Wes and Rui catch up before she can leave, so she slips away from them to avoid leading them there. However, she drops her key to the train on the way out, so Wes picks it up and drives the train to the lab.

Inside the lab, two Cipher Peons intercept them and attempt to seal off the lab by creating an explosion. However, Wes and Rui pick up a dropped key to the lab&#x27;s main gate and continue their infiltration from the main entrance. Eventually, they find and defeat another of the Cipher Admins, Ein, who is the head researcher of the facility.

Wes and Rui then go to Realgam Tower. All four administrators are there and ready to face Wes again. After doing so, he is granted access to the Colosseum at the top of the building. There, he is greeted by a large crowd. A Cipher man named Nascour tells Wes that he will have to face four trainers. After Wes defeats all four trainers, Nascour fights him. Once defeated, Nascour tries to leave, only to be interrupted by Es Cade, who reveals that he is really none other than Evice, the head of Cipher, and battles Wes. When Wes defeats him, Evice attempts to escape using a helicopter, but the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh swoops in and blasts it out of the sky. Evice and Nascour are then taken into custody.

==Development and release==
&quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot; was developed by the Japanese game developer Genius Sonority, and published by Nintendo. Just as Nintendo 64 predecessors &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; had served as home console counterparts to the first- and second-generation handheld titles, &quot;Colosseum&quot; had a similar role for the third generation.

The new concept for &quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot; was influenced by RPGs such as &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Persona 2&quot; over the &quot;Pokémon&quot; mold. When asked in an interview with Prima Games why the gameplay of &quot;Colosseum&quot; did not mirror that of the handheld &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, &quot;Pokémon&quot; director Junichi Masuda explained: &quot;How players communicate with each other has been key to the &quot;Pokémon&quot; games – it is the backbone of all &quot;Pokémon&quot; game designs. I feel that the handheld systems work better than the home-based consoles. It&#x27;s certainly possible to come up with concepts for home-based consoles, but we might then have to change the core of the game.&quot;
The transition to 3D also brought new graphical changes. Wes was designed to look &quot;hazy&quot; and about 17 years old. Genius Sonority ported most of the models and animations of first- and second-generation Pokémon from &quot;Stadium&quot; and &quot;Stadium 2&quot;. Genius Sonority based most of Orre on the real-life city of Phoenix, Arizona. As a whole, the graphics were influenced more by manga than by established &quot;Pokémon&quot; convention.

A preview for the game was hosted at E3 2003. Upon completion of development, &quot;Colosseum&quot; received a rating of &quot;E&quot; (Everyone) from the Entertainment Software Rating Board, &quot;All Ages&quot; from Computer Entertainment Rating Organization, and &quot;3+&quot; from Pan European Game Information. The game was released on November 21, 2003, in Japan; March 22, 2004, in North America, and May 14, 2004, in Europe.

Nintendo also published supplementary media to unlock additional content. Pre-ordered copies of the game came with a bonus disc that contains trailers for the game and the film &quot;Pokémon: Jirachi Wish Maker&quot;. The North American disc also contains the exclusive Pokémon Jirachi that can be downloaded to the player&#x27;s copy of &quot;Ruby&quot; or &quot;Sapphire&quot;. The Japanese release contains a downloadable Celebi instead and requires a completed save file of Pokémon Colosseum. The disc also updates the software in &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; to remove a &quot;berry glitch&quot; discovered in 2003. Despite public anticipation the Bonus Disc was not released in PAL territories, prompting Nintendo to issue an official apology. However a Jirachi was later included in the PAL version of the game Pokémon Channel. In Japan, scannable cards for the Nintendo e-Reader were available for purchase that featured additional trainers to battle and capture Shadow Pokémon.

==Reception==

===Critical response===

&quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot; was generally well-received upon release, with respective scores of 73/100 and 73.46% from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings. &quot;Allgame&quot; staff writer Scott Alan Marriott gave the game three and a half stars out of five, although he did not review the game with more depth. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot; for &quot;Console Children&#x27;s Game of the Year&quot;. 

Critics praised &quot;Colosseum&quot; as the first true 3D role-playing installment in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series and for its darker tone. &quot;Gamers Hell&quot; reviewer John K. called it &quot;certainly a step in the right direction to a good 3D &quot;Pokémon&quot; game&quot;, although he felt that the limited number of Pokémon and lack of a true overworld detracted from the experience. &quot;IGN&quot; staff writer Craig Harris said that the adaptation of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; RPG formula to the 3D zeitgeist &quot;does a decent enough job&quot; and is &quot;a bit more linear and straightforward&quot;.

The new 3D graphics received mixed remarks. Harris called the game &quot;[g]raphically ... a mixed bag&quot;, praising the visual style of the game&#x27;s Pokémon but criticizing the &quot;poorly modeled and animated, angular&quot; style of the Trainers. &quot;GameSpot&quot; reviewer Ryan Davis offered a similar opinion, concluding that &quot;[t]he visual style ... has gone off the deep end&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; writer Star Dingo called the graphics as a whole &quot;insanely cute&quot; but criticized the lack of animations showing two Pokémon attacking in tandem. &quot;GameZone&quot;″s review took a more positive stance, saying that &quot;[a]nimations are brief but impressive; each attack move is more elaborate and more extravagant on the &#x27;Cube.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; thought similarly, commending the &quot;amazing level of detail&quot;. Nimensio Rivera of the San Diego Union-Tribune praised the game for its gameplay, graphics and replay value, but criticized its sound, specifically its soundtrack which was described as “Saturday morning-ish.”

&quot;GameZone&quot; compared the overall town design and environments to those of the landmark &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Dingo complained that &quot;there are some characters to talk to and chests to find, but no &#x27;overworld&#x27; with free-roaming monsters to capture.&quot; John K. stated that &quot;[t]he towns are made with enough detail, but sometimes a bit dull.&quot;

Harris denounced the game&#x27;s usage of old Pokémon battle cries, a recurring complaint of the series. Dingo called the music as a whole &quot;a bit too low-tech and synthetic&quot;. &quot;GameZone&quot;, in contrast, stated that the sound effects evoke nostalgia for &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, and that the music tracks &quot;have more depth than any of the songs from the previous Pokémon games.&quot; John K. said that the music is neither annoying nor entertaining. Retronauts described &quot;Colosseum&quot; as &quot;terrible&quot;, citing the reuse of graphics from the &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; games.

In 2006, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed &quot;Colosseum&quot; as the 121st greatest video game to appear on a Nintendo console.

===Sales===
Three weeks before its release, pre-orders of &quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot; made it the best-selling game on Amazon.com. In the game&#x27;s first week of release in the United Kingdom, it boosted the GameCube&#x27;s market share from 16% to 32%. It was the best-selling GameCube game of May 2004, and fourteenth among all consoles. In 2005, the game was certified as part of Nintendo&#x27;s Player&#x27;s Choice line in North America, representing at least 250,000 copies sold. As of 2007, the game has sold over 1.15 million copies in the United States and 656,270 in Japan. It is the best-selling RPG for the GameCube.

===Legacy===
&quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot; spawned a high-profile tournament in the United Kingdom entitled &quot;Pokémon Colosseum Battlemaster 2004&quot;. The first round of battles was held at Toys &quot;R&quot; Us locations, with later battles taking place in movie theaters. Across Europe, the game was bundled with GameCube consoles shortly after its release. Special editions of this set also included a copy of &quot;Pokémon Box: Ruby and Sapphire&quot;—a game that allows players to organize and store up to 1,500 Pokémon from their games—as well as a memory card and a Game Boy Advance–GameCube link cable.

A manga adaptation of &quot;Colosseum&quot;″s plot was printed in 2004 issues of the Japanese magazine &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot; and titled . The game was followed by a 2005 sequel entitled &quot;Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness&quot;. Set in Orre five years after &quot;Colosseum&quot;, it features a new protagonist snagging Shadow Pokémon from Team Cipher. Shadow Lugia is the game&#x27;s mascot, and serves as an antagonist whom the player can snag. The game alludes to Wes, Rui, and The Under, though they do not appear.

<doc id="431246" wikidata="Q316431" url="?curid=431246" title="R. A. Salvatore">
<text>Robert Anthony Salvatore (born January 20, 1959) is an American author best known for &quot;The Legend of Drizzt&quot;, a series of fantasy novels set in the Forgotten Realms and starring the character Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden. He has also written &quot;The DemonWars Saga&quot;, a series of high fantasy novels; several other Forgotten Realms novels; and &quot;Vector Prime&quot;, the first novel in the &quot;Star Wars: The New Jedi Order&quot; series. He has sold more than 15 million copies of his books in the United States alone, and 22 of his titles have been &quot;New York Times&quot; best-sellers.

==Early life and education==

Salvatore was born in Leominster, Massachusetts, the youngest of a family of seven. A graduate of Leominster High School, he has said his high-school English teacher was instrumental in his development as a writer. During his time at Fitchburg State College, he became interested in fantasy after reading J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, given to him as a Christmas gift. He developed an interest in fantasy and other literature, and changed his major from computer science to journalism, earning a Bachelor of Science in communications/media in 1981. Later he earned a Bachelor of Arts in English. Before taking up writing full-time, he worked as a bouncer. He attributes his fierce and vividly described battle scenes to his experience as a bouncer.

In 1997, Salvatore&#x27;s letters, manuscripts, and other professional papers were donated to the R. A. Salvatore collection at Fitchburg State.

==Career==

===1980s–90s===
In 1982, Salvatore started writing more seriously, developing a manuscript, &quot;Echoes of the Fourth Magic&quot;, about a submarine sucked into a post-apocalyptic future that resembled a fantasy world. He created the setting of Ynis Aielle for the novel, writing it in longhand by candlelight. Salvatore sent the work to several publishers from 1983 to 1987, including TSR, Inc. Mary Kirchoff, then working for TSR&#x27;s book department in reviewing the slush pile of unsolicited submissions, did not like the story much, but did like Salvatore&#x27;s writing. TSR was then looking for an author to write the second book in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; line and asked Salvatore to audition. In July 1987, he won the assignment. Much of the &quot;Realms&quot; setting was then undeveloped and waiting to be fleshed out, giving Salvatore relatively free rein. He wrote his first published novel, &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;, in just two months, and TSR published it in 1988. Salvatore&#x27;s &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; trilogy (&quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;, &quot;Streams of Silver&quot;, and &quot;The Halfling&#x27;s Gem&quot;) was a huge hit, with over 1.5 million copies sold of the first two novels, and the third book hitting &quot;The New York Times&quot; list of paperback bestsellers. Salvatore&#x27;s first novel published in hardcover was another Drizzt book, &quot;The Legacy&quot; (1992). It reached the number 9 slot on &quot;The New York Times&quot; list of bestsellers in September 1992. In 1994, Salvatore branched out beyond working for TSR; he signed a three-book deal with Warner Books for what became The Crimson Shadow series. He and TSR engaged in a dispute afterward. TSR&#x27;s managing editor of the fiction department, Brian Thomsen, wanted Salvatore to write six additional novels when renewing the contract, rather than the three that Salvatore offered. Salvatore, who had just agreed to write three novels for Warner and had written 14 in the previous six years, was unwilling to commit to write so many novels in such a short time at the rate TSR offered; he would have to write three novels a year to honor all his obligations to TSR and Warner had he taken TSR&#x27;s contract as written. Thomsen suggested that Salvatore find a ghostwriter, a suggestion Salvatore found distasteful. Negotiations ultimately fell through; TSR was unwilling to budge on its demands and unwilling to put the Drizzt brand on hold while Salvatore finished books for other publishers. TSR also possibly believed that the &quot;brand&quot; was more valuable than any specific author, as Thomsen said he would find another author to write Drizzt (TSR owned the rights to the Forgotten Realms and all its characters). For his part, Salvatore felt bullied by the company to which he had contributed such a valuable property, and signed a three-novel deal with Del Rey instead for what became &quot;The DemonWars Saga&quot;. His last Drizzt novel for some time was 1996&#x27;s &quot;Passage to Dawn&quot;, fulfilling his previous contract. Salvatore publicly said that if TSR assigned another author to write Drizzt, he would never write Drizzt again and would consider Drizzt dead. TSR followed through with its threat and chose a new author to write Drizzt stories; Mark Anthony completed the Drizzt novel &quot;The Shores of Dusk&quot;. After Wizards of the Coast acquired TSR in 1997, one of its first actions was to fire Thomsen and attempt to mend broken bonds with TSR&#x27;s authors. Wizards shelved Anthony&#x27;s novel to lure Salvatore back. Salvatore returned to the Drizzt series with &quot;The Silent Blade&quot; (1998), which won the Origins Award that year. He published several more series of books in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign world.

Salvatore wrote &quot;Vector Prime&quot;, which was published in 1999 as the first novel in the &quot;Star Wars: The New Jedi Order&quot; series. &quot;Vector Prime&quot; was controversial among &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans because its plot included the death of Chewbacca, who became the first major character from the original trilogy to be killed in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe novels. Many fans thought that Salvatore had made this decision, but in fact Lucasfilm and Del Rey&#x27;s editors had decided they needed to kill a character to sell the new threat of the Yuuzhan Vong; the editors wanted to kill Luke Skywalker, but were refused permission by Lucasfilm. Randy Stradley, then an editor at Dark Horse Comics, suggested killing Chewbacca, and the decision was made. Much later, after Disney bought the rights to &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 2012, it declared in 2014 that all Expanded Universe works released before 2014 were non-canon. Chewbacca&#x27;s death in &quot;Vector Prime&quot; was cited as a major reason for revoking the canonical status of so many works.

In February 2008, Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing published &quot;Spooks&quot;, a comic book about a U.S. government anti-paranormal investigator/task force created by Larry Hama and Salvatore. Hama created the military characters and plots, and Salvatore covered the monster characters.

In addition to his novels, Salvatore has written for video games. He wrote the story for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC video game &quot;Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone&quot; (2004), working with the design team at Stormfront Studios. The game was published by Atari and was nominated for awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences and BAFTA. CDS books commissioned him to edit a four book series based on the interactive online &quot;EverQuest&quot; game. He also wrote the bot chat lines for the &quot;Quake III&quot; bots.

Salvatore was hired as creative director for the newly created game developer 38 Studios, owned by former baseball player Curt Schilling. He wrote the dialogue and created a backstory spanning 10,000 years for the fantasy game &quot;Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning&quot;, which was released in 2012 and sold over one million units. But three months later, 38 Studios declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. The company laid off its entire staff, including Salvatore, with the $2 million fee for his services never paid. Salvatore said he harbored no ill will toward Schilling, who &quot;didn&#x27;t do anything nefarious&quot; and also suffered losses.

In 2010, Wizards of the Coast announced a new deal with Salvatore to write six more books featuring Drizzt; the books were released between 2011 and 2016.

==Bibliography==

Salvatore is best known for &quot;The Legend of Drizzt&quot;, a series of fantasy novels set in the Forgotten Realms and starring the character Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden. He has also written several other Forgotten Realms novels; &quot;The DemonWars Saga&quot; (a series of high fantasy novels); &quot;Vector Prime&quot; (the first novel in the &quot;Star Wars: The New Jedi Order&quot; series); and several other novels and series (see bibliography for full list).

<doc id="431251" wikidata="Q1754839" url="?curid=431251" title="Immortal Beloved (1994 film)">
<text>Immortal Beloved is a 1994 biographical film written and directed by Bernard Rose and starring Gary Oldman, Jeroen Krabbé, Isabella Rossellini and Johanna ter Steege. The film narrates the life of composer Ludwig van Beethoven (played by Oldman) in flashbacks while it follows Beethoven&#x27;s secretary and first biographer Anton Schindler&#x27;s (Krabbé) quest to ascertain the true identity of the &quot;Unsterbliche Geliebte&quot; (Immortal Beloved) addressed in three letters found in the late composer&#x27;s private papers. Schindler journeys throughout the Austrian Empire interviewing women who might be potential candidates, as well as through Beethoven&#x27;s own tumultuous life.

==Plot==
When Ludwig van Beethoven dies, his assistant and close friend Schindler deals with his last will and testament. It reads that his estate, music and affairs will be left to his &quot;immortal beloved,&quot; but there remains a question as to who is Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;immortal beloved,&quot; an unnamed woman mentioned in one of his letters. Schindler embarks on a quest to find out and meets the women whom he had known played a part in Ludwig&#x27;s life.

Schindler first meets with Giulietta Giucciardi, who had been a piano student of Beethoven&#x27;s when she was a young, unmarried woman and had fallen in love with him. In flashback, we see that – despite Giulietta&#x27;s father&#x27;s disapproval – she intends to marry Beethoven, who has proposed to her. She attempts to gain her father&#x27;s consent by proving that, despite rumors to the contrary, Beethoven can still play music, and hides with her father while the composer plays their new pianoforte, believing he is alone. When he discovers Giulietta and her father, he is furious, feeling betrayed. He cuts ties with her and storms out. She calls after him to apologize, and only then realizes that Beethoven is deaf.

Schindler next meets Anna-Marie Erdödy, who took Beethoven in after becoming outraged with the audience mocking him at a poor performance, as the composer, now completely deaf, had become unable to properly conduct the orchestra. Anna-Marie&#x27;s young son is killed during Napoleon&#x27;s attack on Vienna and Beethoven comforts her in her grief, leading to a love affair, but she denies being his &quot;immortal beloved.&quot;

Schindler&#x27;s investigation brings him back to Beethoven&#x27;s own family, recounting his disapproval of his brother marrying Johanna Reiss, the daughter of Anton Van Reiss, a prosperous Viennese upholsterer, even attempting to have her arrested at one point. After his brother&#x27;s death, Beethoven is able to seize custody of his nephew Karl. Even though the boy is indifferent to music, his uncle becomes obsessed with making him a composer, neglecting his own career, which suffers.

Karl grows into a teenager, having spent hours daily practicing the piano. Beethoven is convinced that Karl will be a great success as a composer, but Karl knows he has no talent and, pushed to his breaking point by his uncle, attempts suicide. He survives but tells Beethoven he never wants to see him again.

Schindler discovers that Beethoven&#x27;s great love was Johanna, and that Karl, conceived before her marriage, is actually his son, not his nephew. They had intended to elope, but Beethoven was delayed and wrote the &quot;immortal beloved&quot; letter to Johanna to let her know. However, Johanna never received it and, believing Beethoven had abandoned her, left and married his brother instead. Both feeling betrayed, their love grew to hate. Johanna tells Schindler that when she saw the performance of his ninth symphony, she was moved to forgive him and ultimately made peace with him on his deathbed, where he gave her a signed letter, giving her custody over Karl.

Schindler gives Johanna the letter to the &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; in which she finally reads what happened that night they were supposed to meet. Shocked to find out how an unfortunate event and misunderstanding has kept them apart, she visits Beethoven&#x27;s grave.

==Historical background==
After Beethoven&#x27;s death in 1827, a three-part letter was found among his private papers addressed to a woman whom he called &quot;immortal beloved&quot;. Written in the summer of 1812 from the spa town of Teplice, the letter has generated a great deal of speculation and debate among scholars and writers as to her identity. Among the candidates, then and now, are Giulietta Guicciardi, Thérèse von Brunsvik, Josephine Brunsvik, Antonie Brentano, and Anna-Marie Erdödy, some of whom are portrayed in the film.

The film&#x27;s writer and director, Bernard Rose, though not a historian, claimed that he had successfully identified the addressed woman as Beethoven&#x27;s sister-in-law Johanna (Reiss) van Beethoven, a claim no scholar on Beethoven has endorsed. The film also implies that Karl, Beethoven&#x27;s nephew, was in reality the couple&#x27;s son. Biographer Gail S. Altman disputed Rose&#x27;s claim in a book devoted specifically to the question of the woman&#x27;s identity and Beethoven&#x27;s relationships in general.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Reviews for &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; were mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 57% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A contrived romantic mystery and ponderous pacing make &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; a not-so-joyful ode to Ludwig van Beethoven, despite Gary Oldman&#x27;s best efforts to inject some passion into proceedings.&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A− on scale of A to F.

Emanuel Levy gave the film a &quot;C&quot; rating, calling it a &quot;speculative chronicle&quot; that lacks the &quot;vibrant energy and charm&quot; of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart biopic &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984). He praised the &quot;wonderfully recorded and inventively used&quot; Beethoven compositions as well as the casting of Oldman, who he felt was &quot;the perfect actor to portray the arrogant, irascible musician&quot;. Roger Ebert was highly complimentary of the film. He gave it three and a half stars out of four, stating in his review: &quot;&quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; has clearly been made by people who feel Beethoven directly in their hearts&quot;. He asserted that Oldman &quot;at first seems an unlikely choice...then we see that he is right&quot;. Janet Maslin also offered a positive review, stating: &quot;thanks to its hugely effective use of Beethoven&#x27;s most thrilling, tumultuous music, this film exerts much the same hypnotic power&quot;. She praised the performance of Oldman, writing that &quot;he captures Beethoven as a believably brilliant figure struggling with his deafness and other demons&quot;.

MSN Movies, in a 2011 publication, wrote: &quot;Oldman&#x27;s performance is unimpeachable. He dives deep into the role with powerful passion and makes the audience feel the pain of the genius as he loses his hearing and fails to shape his nephew into a similarly talented musician. In the year of &#x27;[Forrest] Gump&#x27;, Oldman was overlooked for a well-deserved Oscar nomination.&quot; Also that year Josh Winning of &quot;Total Film&quot; named Oldman&#x27;s portrayal of Beethoven as one of the five best performances of his career, saying: &quot;Immersing himself fully into the role of the German composer, Oldman is here damn near unrecognisable. The fact that he remains silent for the first 20 minutes of the film while simultaneously emoting for England is a small triumph in itself.&quot;

===Box office===
The movie debuted strongly and was a modest success, generating $9,914,409 in a domestic-only release.

=== Year-end lists ===
* 5th – Steve Persall, &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;
* Top 10 (not ranked) – George Meyer, &quot;The Ledger&quot;

<text>The National Academy of Medicine (NAM), known as the Institute of Medicine (IoM) until 2015, is an American nonprofit, non-governmental organization. The National Academy of Medicine is a part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, along with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM).

Operating outside the framework of the U.S. federal government, it relies on a volunteer workforce of scientists and other experts, operating under a formal peer-review system. As a national academy, the organization annually elects new members with the help of its current members; the election is based on the members&#x27; distinguished and continuing achievements in a relevant field as well as for their willingness to participate actively.

==History==
The institute was founded in 1970, under the congressional charter of the National Academy of Sciences as the Institute of Medicine.

On April 28, 2015, NAS membership voted in favor of reconstituting the membership of the IOM as a new National Academy of Medicine and establishing a new division on health and medicine within the NRC that has the program activities of the IOM at its core. These changes took effect on July 1, 2015.

==Overview==
The National Academies attempt to obtain authoritative, objective, and scientifically balanced answers to difficult questions of national importance. The work is conducted by committees of volunteer scientists—leading national and international experts—who serve without compensation. Committees are chosen to assure the requisite expertise and avoid bias or conflict of interest. Every report produced by committee undergoes extensive review and evaluation by a group of external experts who are anonymous to the committee, and whose names are revealed only once the study is published. Victor Dzau is President and Chairman of the Council. His six-year term began on July 1, 2014. The Leonard D. Schaeffer Executive Officer is J. Michael McGinnis.

The majority of studies and other activities are requested and funded by the federal government. Private industry, foundations, and state and local governments also initiate studies, as does the academy itself. Reports are made available online for free by the publishing arm of the United States National Academies, the National Academies Press, in multiple formats.

The academy is both an honorific membership organization and a policy research organization. Its members, elected on the basis of their professional achievement and commitment to service, serve without compensation in the conduct of studies and other activities on matters of significance to health. Election to active membership is both an honor and a commitment to serve in Institute affairs. The bylaws specify that no more than 80 new members shall be elected annually, including 10 from outside the United States. The announcement of newly elected members occurs at the Annual Meeting in October. As of October 20, 2015, the number of regular members plus international and emeritus members is 2,012. An unusual diversity of talent among NAM members is assured by the charter stipulation that at least one-quarter be selected from outside the health professions, from such fields as the natural, social, and behavioral sciences, as well as law, administration, engineering, and the humanities.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called the NAM (then called the IOM) the United States&#x27; &quot;most esteemed and authoritative adviser on issues of health and medicine, and its reports can transform medical thinking around the world&quot;.

=== &quot;NAM Perspectives&quot; ===
NAM publishes a weekly periodical, &quot;NAM Perspectives&quot;, described as &quot;a venue for leading health, medical, science, and policy experts to reflect on issues and opportunities important to the advancement of the NAM&#x27;s mission&quot;. Papers present evidence-based descriptions and individual viewpoints on strategies and priorities, and must be accessible to a broad audience.

==Awards==
The Rhoda and Bernard Sarnat International Prize in Mental Health (Sarnat Prize) was established in 1992 and is awarded annually by the Academy to recognize individuals, groups, or organizations for outstanding achievement in improving mental health. It is accompanied by a medal and $20,000.

<text>Alesis Digital Audio Tape, commonly referred to as ADAT, is a magnetic tape format used for the recording of eight digital audio tracks onto the same S-VHS tape used by consumer VCRs, and the basis of a series of multitrack recorders by Alesis. Although originally a tape-based format, the term &quot;ADAT&quot; later also referred to hard disk recorders like the Alesis ADAT HD24. In 2004, recognizing the ADAT for &quot;beginning a revolution of affordable recording tools,&quot; it was inducted into the first-ever TEC Awards TECnology Hall of Fame.

==History==
Alesis announced the first ADAT model at the NAMM Show in Anaheim, California in January 1991, with the first ADAT recorders shipping over a year later in February or March 1992. This original ADAT model recorded up to 8 tracks of 16-bit digital audio on a standard S-VHS tape cartridge. Additionally, up to 16 ADATs could be connected to each other to record up to 128 tracks simultaneously with sample-accurate timing. This capability and the ADAT&#x27;s low cost (it was originally introduced at ) were largely responsible for the rise of project studios in the 1990s.

Alesis produced several models of ADAT recorders. The original ADAT (later referred to as &quot;Blackface&quot;) and the ADAT XT record 16 bits per sample (ADAT Type I). A later generation of machines—the XT-20, LX-20 and M-20—support 20 bits per sample (ADAT Type II). All ADAT machines use the same high-quality S-VHS tape media. Tapes recorded in the older Type I format can be read and written in the more modern machines, but not the other way around. Later generations are capable of recording at a sample rate of either 44.1 or 48 kHz, common in the audio industry. Pitch control is available by varying the sample rate, and thus tape speed accordingly.

With locate points it was possible to store sample-exact positions on tape, making it easy to find specific parts of digital recordings. Using &quot;auto play&quot; and &quot;auto record&quot; functions made it possible to punch in/out at predetermined points, rather than relying on human timing ability to start and stop recording at precisely the right instant.

ADAT machines could be controlled externally with the Alesis LRC (Little Remote Control), which could be attached to the ADAT with a 1/4&quot; tip/sleeve plug, and featured the transport controls and most commonly used functions. Alternatively, the BRC (Big Remote Control) could be used, which included many more features that the stand-alone ADAT did not have.

<text>A digital audio workstation (DAW ) is an electronic device or application software used for recording, editing and producing audio files. DAWs come in a wide variety of configurations from a single software program on a laptop, to an integrated stand-alone unit, all the way to a highly complex configuration of numerous components controlled by a central computer. Regardless of configuration, modern DAWs have a central interface that allows the user to alter and mix multiple recordings and tracks into a final produced piece.

DAWs are used for producing and recording music, songs, speech, radio, television, soundtracks, podcasts, sound effects and nearly every other kind of complex recorded audio.

== Hardware ==
Early attempts at digital audio workstations in the 1970s and 1980s faced limitations such as the high price of storage, and the vastly slower processing and disk speeds of the time.

In 1978, Soundstream, who had made one of the first commercially available digital audio tape recorders in 1977, built what could be considered the first digital audio workstation using some of the most current computer hardware of the time. The &quot;Digital Editing System&quot;, as Soundstream called it, consisted of a DEC PDP-11/60 minicomputer running a custom software package called DAP (Digital Audio Processor), a Braegen 14&quot;-platter hard disk drive, a storage oscilloscope to display audio waveforms for editing, and a video display terminal for controlling the system. Interface cards that plugged into the PDP-11&#x27;s Unibus slots (the Digital Audio Interface, or DAI) provided analog and digital audio input and output for interfacing to Soundstream&#x27;s digital recorders and conventional analog tape recorders. The DAP software could perform edits to the audio recorded on the system&#x27;s hard disks and produce simple effects such as crossfades.

By the late 1980s, a number of personal computers such as the Macintosh, Atari ST, and Amiga began to have enough power to handle digital audio editing. Engineers used Macromedia&#x27;s Soundedit, with Microdeal&#x27;s Replay Professional and Digidesign&#x27;s &quot;Sound Tools&quot; and &quot;Sound Designer&quot; to edit audio samples for sampling keyboards like the E-mu Emulator II and the Akai S900. Soon, people began to use them for simple two-track audio editing and audio mastering.

In 1989, Sonic Solutions released the first professional (48 kHz at 24 bit) disk-based non-linear audio editing system. The Macintosh IIfx-based Sonic System, based on research done earlier at George Lucas&#x27; Sprocket Systems, featured complete CD premastering, with integrated control of Sony&#x27;s industry-standard U-matic tape-based digital audio editor.

Many major recording studios switched over to using digital audio after Digidesign introduced its Pro Tools software in 1991, modeled after the traditional method and signal flow in most analog recording devices. At this time, most DAWs were Apple Mac based (e.g., Pro Tools, Studer Dyaxis, Sonic Solutions). Around 1992, the first Windows-based DAWs started to emerge from companies such as Innovative Quality Software (IQS) (now SAWStudio), Soundscape Digital Technology, SADiE, Echo Digital Audio, and Spectral Synthesis. All the systems at this point used dedicated hardware for their audio processing.

In 1992, Sunrize Industries released the AD516 soundcard for big-box Amiga computers. This allowed up to 8 tracks of 16-bit 48 kHz direct-to-disk recording and playback using its Studio 16 software. It could also integrate directly into Blue Ribbon Soundworks&#x27; Bars &amp; Pipes Pro MIDI software or NewTek&#x27;s Video Toaster, thus providing a complete package of MIDI sequencing and/or video synchronization with non-linear hard disk recording.

In 1993, the German company Steinberg released Cubase Audio on Atari Falcon 030. This version brought DSP built-in effects with 8-track audio recording and playback using only native hardware. The first Windows-based software-only product, introduced in 1993, was Samplitude (which already existed in 1992 as an audio editor for the Commodore Amiga).

===Integration===

An integrated DAW consists of a digital signal processing, control surface, audio converters, and data storage in one device. Integrated DAWs were popular before commonly available personal computers became powerful enough to run DAW software. As personal computer power and speed increased and price decreased, the popularity of costly integrated systems dropped.

==Software==
DAW can refer to the software itself, but traditionally, a computer-based DAW has four basic components: a computer, a sound card or other audio interface, audio editing software, and at least one user input device for adding or modifying data. This could be as simple as a mouse and keyboard or as sophisticated as a piano-style MIDI controller keyboard or automated audio control surface for mixing track volumes.

The computer acts as a host for the sound card, while the software provides the interface and functionality for audio editing. The sound card typically converts analog audio signals into a digital form, and digital back to analog audio when playing it back; it may also assist in further processing of the audio. The software controls all related hardware components and provides a user interface to allow for recording, editing, and playback.

Computer-based DAWs have extensive recording, editing, and playback capabilities (and some also have video-related features). For example, they can provide a practically limitless number of tracks to record on, polyphony, and virtual synthesizers or sample-based instruments to use for recording music. DAWs can also provide a wide variety of effects, such as reverb, to enhance or change the sounds themselves.

Simple smartphone-based DAWs, called mobile audio workstation (MAWs), are used (for example) by journalists for recording and editing on location.

As software systems, DAWs are designed with many user interfaces, but generally, they are based on a multitrack tape recorder metaphor, making it easier for recording engineers and musicians already familiar with using tape recorders to become familiar with the new systems. Therefore, computer-based DAWs tend to have a standard layout that includes transport controls (play, rewind, record, etc.), track controls and a mixer. A waveform display is another common feature.

Single-track DAWs display only one (mono or stereo form) track at a time. Multitrack DAWs support operations on multiple tracks at once. Like a mixing console, each track typically has controls that allow the user to adjust the gain, equalization and stereo panning of the sound on each track. In a traditional recording studio additional rackmount processing gear is physically plugged into the audio signal path to add reverb, compression, etc. However, a DAW can also route in software or use audio plug-ins (for example, a VST plugin) to process the sound on a track.

Perhaps the most significant feature available from a DAW that is not available in analog recording is the ability to undo a previous action, using a command similar to that of the undo function in word processing software. Undo makes it much easier to avoid accidentally permanently erasing or recording over a previous recording. If a mistake or unwanted change is made, the undo command is used to conveniently revert the changed data to a previous state. Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo are familiar and common computer commands and they are usually available in DAWs in some form. More common functions include the modifications of several factors concerning a sound. These include wave shape, pitch, tempo, and filtering.

Commonly DAWs feature some form of mix automation using procedural line segment-based or curve-based interactive graphs. The lines and curves of the automation graph are joined by or comprise adjustable points. By creating and adjusting multiple points along a waveform or control events, the user can specify parameters of the output over time (e.g., volume or pan). Automation data may also be directly derived from human gestures recorded by a control surface or MIDI controller.

MIDI recording, editing, and playback is increasingly incorporated into modern DAWs of all types, as is synchronization with other audio or video tools.

There are many free and open-source software programs that perform DAW functions. These are designed to run on a variety of operating systems and are usually developed non-commercially.

Personal Composer created by Jim Miller for Yamaha was the star of the NAMM Show in 1983. Personal Composer runs under MS DOS 2.0 and includes a MIDI sequencer, synth editor (such as Yamaha&#x27;s DX7), universal librarians and a score editor. The software was later released as Personal Composer System/2 (1988).

In 1996, Steinberg introduced a revamped Cubase (which was originally launched in 1989 as a MIDI sequencer for the Atari ST computer, later developed for Mac and Windows PC platforms, but had no audio capabilities until 1993&#x27;s Cubase Audio) which could record and play back up to 32 tracks of digital audio on an Apple Macintosh without the need of any external DSP hardware. Cubase not only modeled a tape-like interface for recording and editing, but, in addition, using VST also developed by Steinberg, modeled the entire mixing desk and effects rack common in analog studios. This revolutionized the DAW world, both in features and price tag, and was quickly imitated by most other contemporary DAW systems.

Digital audio applications for Linux and BSD fostered technologies such as Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), which drives audio hardware, and JACK Audio Connection Kit. JACK allows any JACK-aware audio software to connect to any other audio software running on the system, such as connecting an ALSA- or OSS-driven soundcard to a mixing and editing front-end, like Ardour or Rosegarden. In this way, JACK acts as a virtual audio patch bay, and it can be configured to use a computer&#x27;s resources in real time, with dedicated memory, and with various options that minimize the DAW&#x27;s latency. This kind of abstraction and configuration allows DJs to use multiple programs for editing and synthesizing audio streams, or multitasking and duplexing, without the need for analog conversion, or saving and reloading files, and ensures a high level of audio fidelity.

Members of the Linux Audio Development (LAD) mailing list have contributed to development of standards such as the LADSPA, DSSI and LV2 plugin architectures. The Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plugin standard is supported by some programs.

===Plug-ins===
There are countless software plugins for DAW software, each one coming with its own unique functionality, thus expanding the overall variety of sounds and manipulations that are possible. Each have their own form of generating or manipulating sound, tone, pitch, and speed of a simple sound and transform it into something different. To achieve an even more distinctive sound, multiple plugins can be used in layers, and further automated to manipulate the original sounds.

===Generative Audio Workstations===

Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence are spurring innovation in DAW software. A research paper from Georgia Tech, titled &quot;Composing with Generative Systems in the Digital Audio Workstation&quot;, proposed the term &quot;Generative Audio Workstation&quot; to describe this emerging class of DAWs.

Three examples of notable GAWs are AIVA, WavTool, and Symphony V. AIVA provides parameter-based AI MIDI song generation within a DAW. WavTool offers a browser DAW equipped with a GPT-4 composition assistant and AI text-to-sample generator. Symphony V provides generative vocal synthesis, note editing, and mixing tools.

Generative AI services have also become available through plugins that integrate with conventional DAWs, such as Izotope Neutron 4, TAIP, and Synthesizer V. Neutron 4 includes a &quot;mix assistant&quot; that uses machine learning to analyze audio and automatically apply processing effects. TAIP provides tape saturation powered by AI neural networks that imitate traditional DSP processing. Synthesizer V offers several AI vocalists whose notes can be manipulated.

To reduce the strain on computer memory, some plugin companies have developed thin client VSTs that use resources from a cloud server. For example, the audio-to-MIDI plugin Samplab offers a desktop application with user authentication and API calls that perform stem separation and MIDI transcription off of the computer&#x27;s local device. This can improve load speeds or prevent applications from crashing.

==Impact==
DAWs can be implemented in a music education class to show students how to use them and learn how to produce their own music. According to a study done by the Indonesia University of Education, the use of a DAW in music learning can let students build their learning of music production on their own. Another study done by the University of Milan made a DAW accessible to kids.

The usage of DAW can be found in most hip hop and EDM music with the use of looping an instrumental. With music production also moving to a laptop can put the music making outside of a studio and into a bedroom.

<doc id="431271" wikidata="Q1840092" url="?curid=431271" title="List of escort carriers of the United States Navy">
<text>The United States Navy had a sizable fleet of escort aircraft carriers during World War II and the early Cold War era that followed. 

==Historical overview==
Prior to the creation of the escort carrier hull classification symbol (CVE) on 15 July 1943, these ships were designated as Auxiliary aircraft escort vessels (AVG) until 20 August 1942 and then Auxiliary aircraft carriers (ACV).

These ships were both quicker and cheaper to build than larger fleet carriers and were built in great numbers to serve as a stop-gap measure when fleet carriers were too few. However, they were usually too slow to keep up with naval task forces and would typically be assigned to amphibious operations, often seen in the Pacific War&#x27;s island hopping campaign, or to convoy protection in the war in the Atlantic. 

To that end, many of these ships were transferred to the Royal Navy as part of the US-UK lend-lease program. Note that many of the lower-numbered carriers were transferred to the Royal Navy, where they received new names but retained their original BAVG hull symbols. The new names are mentioned in each article individually. While some of these ships were kept for a time in reserve after the war, none survive today, as they have all since been sunk or retired and scrapped. The following are the classes and stand-alone ships of the US Navy&#x27;s escort carriers:

<doc id="431272" wikidata="Q524778" url="?curid=431272" title="Commissioner">
<text>A commissioner (commonly abbreviated as Comm&#x27;r) is, in principle, a member of a commission or an individual who has been given a (official charge or authority to do something).

In practice, the title of commissioner has evolved to include a variety of senior officials, often sitting on a specific commission. In particular, the commissioner frequently refers to senior police or government officials. A high commissioner is equivalent to an ambassador, originally between the United Kingdom and the Dominions and now between all Commonwealth states, whether Commonwealth realms, republics or countries having a monarch other than that of the realms. The title is sometimes given to senior officials in the private sector; for instance, many North American sports leagues.

There is some confusion between commissioners and commissaries because other European languages use the same word for both. Therefore titles such as &quot;commissaire&quot; in French, &quot;Kommissar&quot; in German and &quot;comisario&quot; in Spanish or &quot;commissario&quot; in Italian, can mean either commissioner or commissary in English, depending on the context.

==Domestic public official==
A commissioner within a modern state generally holds his or her office by a commission from the head of state or a council of elected representatives (or appointed by non-elected officials in the case of dictatorships).

===Canadian territories===
Commissioners are the formal heads of the territories in Canada (those areas under the formal jurisdiction of the federal Crown-in-Council without separate constitutional status of a province). Unlike the governor general or a lieutenant governor, commissioners are not viceregal representatives of the Canadian monarch; rather, they are delegates of the federal Crown-in-Council and, under federal statutes governing the territories, act following written instructions from Cabinet or the minister responsible (currently the minister of northern affairs). While commissioners formerly had a direct day-to-day role in administration and government and chaired the territory&#x27;s executive council, today they are under instruction to act more like provincial lieutenant governors, as territorial assemblies have taken on more responsibility. Commissioners thus perform ceremonial duties similar to those of the monarch and viceroys, including reading the speech from the throne at the opening of the territorial legislature and presenting commendations to Canadian Forces members for long-term or outstanding service to the office. Possible candidates for the position are selected by the Advisory Committee on Vice-Regal Appointments. The official appointment is made by the Governor General-in-Council (the federal government).

====Current Canadian commissioners====
===Imperial China===
Senior public servants, commissioners and other high-ranking bureaucrats referred to collectively as &quot;mandarins.&quot;

===Isle of Man===
In the local government system of the Isle of Man, a commissioner is an elected representative equivalent to a councillor. All town, village, district and parish local government bodies consist of commissioners, except for Douglas, which has a council and councillors.

===Malawi===
Malawi&#x27;s position of district commissioner refers to the person that is appointed by the president of Malawi to oversee the administration of any of its 28 districts. One commissioner is appointed per district. The position was created during the British colonial era, sustained during the Kamuzu Banda era and continues as a prominent position in democratic era in Malawi.

===Scotland===

Prior to the Acts of Union 1707, an elected member of the Estates (parliament) of Scotland held the office of commissioner, representing a constituency (the equivalent of a member of parliament in the contemporaneous Parliament of England). There were burgh commissioners and shire or stewartry commissioners.

===United States===

====Current====
In many U.S. states, the legislative and executive decision-making bodies of counties are called the board of commissioners or county commission.

In Minnesota, Alaska,New Hampshire, New York, Texas and Tennessee, the heads of some statewide departments are called &quot;commissioners&quot;.

In California, court commissioners are subordinate judicial officers granted many of the same authorities as judges, though not all.

In some states certain municipalities may have a planning or zoning authority composed of local officials or members of the public. These authorities can be called commissions with the members addressed as &quot;commissioners&quot;.

====Historic====
In the past, the U.S. government-appointed special commissioners for a variety of tasks. For example, the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1862 to 1889 was a commissioner, not a Cabinet secretary.

Until 1968, federal courts appointed commissioners to perform routine judicial duties such as taking testimony, taking bail, and even enforcing laws such as the Fugitive Slave Act. These commissioners were replaced by United States magistrates.

===General===

====Police====

In police services in the Commonwealth of Nations and the United States, the title of commissioner typically designates the head of an entire police force.

In other countries, such as Latin American countries, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Italy, etc., a &quot;commissioner&quot; is typically the commander of a major police station or a locally/regionally important police service. The equivalent ranks in the police forces of the United States and the United Kingdom are respectively captain and superintendent.

====Other emergency services====
In firefighting services in the Commonwealth of Nations, the title of &quot;commissioner&quot; typically designates the head of an entire fire service in a particular jurisdiction, such as the commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service or the commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW, two separate fire authorities that operate within the Australian state of New South Wales.

==International public and colonial context==

===British and Commonwealth overseas possessions===
The title of commissioner or district commissioner, as such, was used by the (gubernatorial) chief British official in:
*British India, now composed of four independent countries (Pakistan, India, Burma and Bangladesh), where the divisional commissioner was the head of one of the few divisions of a province and was higher than a deputy commissioner and lower than a secretary (now principal secretary) in the provincial capital.
* British Central Africa
* Territories of Zambesia and Rhodesia, administered under charter by the British South Africa Company
* The Oil Rivers Protectorate (from 5 June 1885 under a consul-general; soon renamed Niger Coast Protectorate), from 3 August 1891 till 1 January 1900 when it became the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, hence under a high commissioner
* The Caribbean Turks and Caicos Islands, 1874 – 4 July 1959, as a dependency under the governor of Jamaica colony
* The Weihaiwei concession territory (held from China) from 1902 to 1938
* Kamaran Island, in June 1915 taken from the Ottoman Empire and subordinated to the Aden Settlement, but not incorporated, till on 30 November 1967 it became part of the newly independent People&#x27;s Republic of South Yemen.
* The UN trust territory of British Cameroons, only two incumbents, from 1 October 1954 (the only Special Resident succeeding himself till 1956) to 1 October 1961 when Southern British Cameroons was incorporated into the independent Republic of Cameroon (former French mandate of Cameroun), after the northern part united with Nigeria on 1 June 1961.

The title of commissioner was also used by the senior diplomatic representatives of Commonwealth countries in British colonies, such as:
*Hong Kong, before the handover to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1997, after which they became known as consuls-general.
*Singapore, prior to independence in 1965, after which they became known as high commissioners.

===Canada===
Canada calls its government officials in charge of export promotion &quot;trade commissioners&quot;. There are 150 offices of the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service in Canada and abroad, and they &quot;assist with export advice and guidance to help [Canadians] achieve [their] international business goals&quot;. The website devoted to the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service uses the Internet domain www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca.

===European Union===
The European commissioners are the members of the European Commission, the cabinet of the European Union. Commissioners’ role closely resembles that of the ministers of the Union’s member states; each is assigned a portfolio under the authority of the president of the EU Commission, but they make important decisions collegially, often subject to approval by the European Parliament and/or the Council of the European Union, the two organs of the EU’s bicameral legislature.

===French colonies===
The French equivalent, &quot;commissaire&quot;, was used for various officials employed at different levels of the colonial administration in several French-ruled countries.

===Russian Empire===
After on 17 April 1914 Tannu Tuva (ethnically Mongolian) was declared a Russian &#x27;protected&#x27; area (Uryanhay [Urjanhaj] kray), two subsequent Russian commissioners for the affairs of Urjanhai Kray (1914–1915 A.P. Cererin (Tsererin) and 1915–1917 Yu.V. Grigoryev) were appointed, alongside the last native tribal paramount chief (title Ambyn-noyon), followed by a single commissar of the provisional government
(October 1917 – 16 March 1918 Aleksey Aleksandrovich Turchaninov) until czarist rule collapsed for good, giving way to the Soviet regime

===United Nations administration===
A UN commissioner appointed in 1949 supervised the transition of the UN Trust territory of Libya (a former Italian colony; actually Tripolitania and Cyrenaica each was under a British administrator, in 1949 restyled Resident, Fezzan under a French military governor, in 1950 also restyled résident) to independence as a united monarchy in 1951.

===United States===
From the mid-19th century until 1939, two U.S. government cabinet departments used the title &quot;commissioner&quot; for officials posted abroad who did not enjoy diplomatic status. U.S. federal agencies have not titled officials posted abroad as commissioners since 1939.

====U.S. Department of Agriculture====
During the 19th century, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) began sending employees, called &quot;agricultural commissioners&quot;, abroad to investigate foreign agriculture. These appointments were of a roving nature, as the officials were not assigned to a particular country or city. In 1919 USDA posted to London an agricultural commissioner without diplomatic status, Edward Foley, to report on British agriculture. Additional commissioners were posted through the 1920s to Buenos Aires, Berlin, and Shanghai. The title began to be phased out in 1930 with the passage of the Foreign Agricultural Service Act, which granted USDA authority to use the diplomatic title &quot;attaché&quot;. The last USDA employee to bear the title &quot;agricultural commissioner&quot; was Owen Dawson, agricultural commissioner at the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai, who received diplomatic status and the title agricultural attaché in 1939 when USDA&#x27;s overseas officers were transferred to the Department of State.

Noted American author Mark Twain recounted meeting one of the 19th-century roving agricultural commissioners in &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot;:

I was proud to observe that among our excursionists were three ministers of the gospel, eight doctors, sixteen or eighteen ladies, several military and naval chieftains with sounding titles, an ample crop of &quot;Professors&quot; of various kinds, and a gentleman who had &quot;COMMISSIONER OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO EUROPE, ASIA, AND AFRICA&quot; thundering after his name in one awful blast! I had carefully prepared myself to take rather a back seat in that ship because of the uncommonly select material that would alone be permitted to pass through the camel&#x27;s eye of that committee on credentials; I had schooled myself to expect an imposing array of military and naval heroes and to have to set that back seat still further back in consequence of it may be, but I state frankly that I was all unprepared for this crusher.

I fell under that titular avalanche a torn and blighted thing. I said that if that potentate must go over in our ship, why, I supposed he must – but that to my thinking, when the United States considered it necessary to send a dignitary of that tonnage across the ocean, it would be in better taste, and safer, to take him apart and cart him over in sections in several ships.

Ah, if I had only known then that he was only a common mortal, and that his mission had nothing more overpowering about it than the collecting of seeds and uncommon yams and extraordinary cabbages and peculiar bullfrogs for that poor, useless, innocent, mildewed old fossil the Smithsonian Institute [sic], I would have felt so much relieved.

====U.S. Department of Commerce====
Following unification of the U.S. Foreign Service under the Rogers Act in 1924, overseas trade promotion shifted from consuls of the United States to &quot;trade commissioners&quot; employed by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Most but not all trade commissioners were retitled commercial attachés upon creation of the Foreign Commerce Service (&quot;viz.&quot;) in 1927. The title &quot;trade commissioner&quot; went out of use in the United States when Commerce&#x27;s overseas officials were transferred to the Department of State and all three U.S. foreign services (of the Departments of State, Agriculture and Commerce) were merged in 1939 under Reorganization Plan No. II.

==Non-public entities==

===The Salvation Army===
In The Salvation Army, the rank of commissioner is the second-highest attainable rank and the highest rank by appointment, as the rank of general is attained by election by the High Council. It is one of the original ranks of the Army and has been in use since 1880, the first commissioner was George Scott Railton.

===Scouting===
Within the Scout Movement, a commissioner is a senior adult leader who is responsible for the management of an aspect of Scouting and/or the leadership of other adults, as opposed to adult leaders who lead youth members.
===Boy Scouts of America===

Commissioners are district and council leaders who help Scout units succeed. They coach and consult with adult leaders of Cub Scout packs, Boy Scout troops, and Venturing crews. Commissioners help maintain the standards of the Boy Scouts of America.

===Sports===
In some sports leagues, including all four North American professional major sports the commissioner is the highest executive position in the league. The exact powers of the commissioner depend on the constitution and/or rules of the league, and are invariably limited by State and Federal Law and collective bargaining agreements. Commissioners are elected by the owners of the league&#x27;s clubs or board of directors/governors, and function as executive directors of the various owner&#x27;s associations describing themselves as Leagues and handle matters such as discipline, arbitration of disputes between the clubs, etc. in the interests of the owners.

The title was first used in 1920, when Kenesaw Mountain Landis was appointed Commissioner of Baseball in the aftermath of the Black Sox Scandal. Landis was titled &quot;commissioner&quot; partly to distinguish his office from that of the &quot;president&quot; of the American and National Leagues. Landis&#x27; title derived from the National Commission, the ruling body for baseball established in 1903, when the two leagues were largely autonomous organizations. The commission originally consisted of three members. Desperate to restore public confidence in their sport&#x27;s integrity, baseball owners agreed to appoint Landis as the game&#x27;s sole &quot;commissioner&quot; after he rebuffed their offer of a position at the head of a reformed commission. Baseball owners also gave Landis absolute power and a lifetime contract, which permitted the former judge to assume more power over the sport than a commissioner in any sport has held since.

The other major professional sports leagues of North America followed suit, either replacing their positions of league president with that of the commissioner or appointing a commissioner and reducing the position of league president to a mere figurehead role. The National Football League appointed its first commissioner in 1941. The NFL, which in its early years faced several rival leagues, intended its commissioner&#x27;s office to be analogous to the one then held by Landis in baseball, with authority over all of professional football. The NFL&#x27;s rivals responded by appointing their own commissioners (thereby explicitly rejecting the NFL commissioner&#x27;s authority). Finally in 1966, the American Football League agreed to abolish their commissioner&#x27;s office and recognize the authority of then-NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle in exchange for the NFL agreeing to a merger with its most successful rival. This did not result in any formal change to Rozelle&#x27;s title or even in his powers, since the NFL constitution already purportedly granted him extensive power over other professional leagues. Nevertheless he became informally known as the &quot;football commissioner&quot; until 1970 when the merger was finalized and the AFL was fully absorbed into the NFL. No rival U.S. football league has recognized the NFL commissioner&#x27;s authority since 1970, although no such league has lasted longer than three seasons.

In Canadian football, the title of commissioner dates to no later than the 1940s. Like many of the NFL&#x27;s rivals south of the border, the top Canadian football leagues then in existence (the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and Western Interprovincial Football Union) appointed commissioners in a bid to assert their leagues&#x27; independence from the NFL commissioner. When the two leagues formed an umbrella organization (the Canadian Football Council) in 1956, the posts of IRFU commissioner and WIFU commissioner were abolished and former WIFU Commissioner Sydney Halter was appointed commissioner of the CFC. When the CFC itself evolved into the modern Canadian Football League in 1958, Halter carried on in the office as that league&#x27;s first commissioner.

The National Basketball Association followed suit by appointing a commissioner in 1967, largely in response to a rival league that commenced play that year. The ABA did not recognize the NBA commissioner&#x27;s authority and maintained its own commissioner&#x27;s office until merging with the NBA in 1976. The National Hockey League did not follow suit when the rival World Hockey Association commenced playing, as then-NHL president Clarence Campbell, who was openly hostile to the WHA&#x27;s very existence, made clear he was not interested in any change to his own title. The NHL finally appointed a commissioner in 1993 (long after merging with the WHA) when incumbent Gary Bettman assumed office. Major League Soccer appointed a commissioner upon its founding later that year.

The use of &quot;commissioner&quot; has been less prevalent in top-level women&#x27;s leagues. When the NBA founded the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) in 1996, it chose to use the title of &quot;president&quot; for that league&#x27;s chief executive, and did not use the title of &quot;commissioner&quot; for that position until 2019. The National Women&#x27;s Soccer League, founded in 2012 with play starting in 2013, initially called its chief executive &quot;commissioner&quot;, but that position had been vacant after the resignation of the league&#x27;s second commissioner, Jeff Plush, shortly before the 2017 season. The NWSL&#x27;s highest office was styled as &quot;president&quot; until the &quot;commissioner&quot; title was reinstated when Lisa Baird filled that post in 2020. Due to the unique ownership structure of the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League, the organization has no current plans to appoint a commissioner.

In general, the commissioners&#x27; powers and responsibilities in the NFL, NBA and NHL are not substantially different from those of the presidents that preceded them. Although baseball&#x27;s subsequent commissioners have not had the absolute power that Landis did, former Commissioner Bud Selig has succeeded in centralizing authority over Major League Baseball in the commissioner&#x27;s office, relegating the position of league president to an honorary title and giving baseball&#x27;s commissioner competencies similar to those of his colleagues in the other major sports.

Many minor professional and amateur leagues throughout the United States and Canada have also appointed commissioners. The title has not caught on outside North America. In Great Britain, the title &quot;chief executive&quot; is used for the most closely equivalent position in that country&#x27;s professional leagues. A key difference between the state of affairs in North America and Europe is that most European sports (including those in Great Britain) include powerful governing bodies that operate independently of and hold some power over the professional leagues, whereas in North America the equivalent governing bodies&#x27; &quot;de facto&quot; authority is mostly confined to amateur sport. For example, while the Premier League is roughly as lucrative and wealthy as the &quot;Big Four&quot; North American leagues, the Football Association nevertheless has the power to veto the appointment of that league&#x27;s chief executive.

The Australian Football League is governed by the AFL Commission, whose members are called &quot;commissioners.&quot; However, the head of the commission, who is the closest equivalent to a North American sports commissioner, is formally titled the &quot;chairman,&quot; and is never referred to as a &quot;commissioner&quot;.

Current commissioners of the North American professional leagues are Roger Goodell in the NFL, Rob Manfred in MLB (and Minor League Baseball), Adam Silver in the NBA, Gary Bettman in the NHL, Don Garber in MLS, Randy Ambrosie in the CFL, Oliver Luck in the XFL, Cathy Engelbert in the WNBA, and Lisa Baird in the NWSL.

<text>Lower New York Bay is a section of New York Bay south of the Narrows (the strait between Staten Island and Brooklyn). The eastern end of the Bay is marked by two spits of land, Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and Rockaway, Queens. The waterway between the spits connects the Bay to the Atlantic Ocean at the New York Bight. Traversing the floor of the Bay southeasterly from the Narrows to the Bight and beyond is Hudson Canyon.

Roughly the northeastern portion of the Bay from the Narrows to Sandy Hook is known as the Lower Bay (named in relation to the neighboring Upper New York Bay); roughly the western portion of the Bay (including the portion at the mouth of New Jersey&#x27;s Raritan River) is called Raritan Bay; and roughly the southeastern portion of the Bay (that is, the portion south and the portion southwest from Sandy Hook) is known as Sandy Hook Bay.

==History and geography==
Since before the time of the Lenape, the Native American inhabitants of the area, the Lower Bay has sustained a rich marine ecosystem with multiple fish species and molluscs, especially oyster, clam and mussel beds. In the 20th century, due to increased population and industrial pollution, the water quality of the bay and its ability to support marine life was severely diminished. The water quality of the bay began to improve with the passage of the 1972 Clean Water Act.

The main shipping channel through Lower New York Bay is the Ambrose Channel, wide and dredged to a depth of . The channel is navigable by ships with up to a 37-foot draft at low tide. The entrance to the Ambrose Channel was marked for many years by the Lightship Ambrose, which was superseded by the Ambrose Light.

The bay contains popular beaches at Brighton Beach and Coney Island in Brooklyn. There are also beaches on Staten Island. Just outside the bay, facing the Atlantic, are the beaches of Sandy Hook and the Rockaways.

===Lighthouses===
Several lighthouses were built to aid navigation in and around Lower New York Bay, located both on land and in the bay itself. The earliest, at Sandy Hook, was built in colonial times.

In New Jersey:
*Chapel Hill Rear Range Light
*Conover Beacon
*Great Beds Light
*Navesink Twin Lights
*Sandy Hook Light

In New York:
*Coney Island Light 
*New Dorp Light
*Princes Bay Light
*Staten Island Light
*Fort Wadsworth Light

Within Lower New York Bay:
*Romer Shoal Light
*West Bank Light
*Old Orchard Shoal Light

===Islands===
There are two small artificial islands in Lower New York Bay, both located a mile offshore from South Beach, Staten Island. 
*Hoffman Island was created in 1873 from Orchard Shoals. It was named for former New York City mayor (1866–1868) and then-current New York Governor (1869–1871) John T. Hoffman. Hoffman Island covers 11 acres (4.45 hectares).
*Swinburne Island, with an area of about 4 acres (16,000 m2), lies immediately to the south. Swinburne Island was originally called Dix Island, but was renamed in honor of Dr. John Swinburne, a noted military surgeon during the Civil War.

In the early 20th century, both islands were used as a quarantine station, housing immigrants found to have been carrying contagious diseases when they landed at Ellis Island. At the start of World War II the United States Merchant Marine used both islands as a training station (which opened in 1938); the Quonset huts built during this period still stand on Swinburne Island.

The other major use for the two islands during World War II were as anchorages for antisubmarine nets that fenced off New York Bay from the Atlantic Ocean to keep enemy submarines out. Both islands are now part of Gateway National Recreation Area.

Fort Lafayette was on a small island in the Narrows, just off the Brooklyn shore. That island was removed during construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Coney Island, originally separated from the southern shore of Brooklyn by a narrow strait, has since been connected to the main part of Long Island by landfill, and is now a peninsula despite its name.

<doc id="431282" wikidata="Q609063" url="?curid=431282" title="Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen">
<text>and are 2004 remakes of the 1996 role-playing video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. They were developed by Game Freak and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; were first released in Japan in January 2004 and in North America and Europe in September and October 2004. The games are part of the third generation of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game series and hold the distinction of being the first enhanced remakes of previous games within the franchise.

As in previous games, the player controls their character from an overhead perspective and participates in turn-based battles. Throughout the games, the player captures and raises Pokémon for use in battle. Based in the Kanto region, new features include a contextual help menu and a new area (Sevii Islands) the player may access after defeating the Elite 4 and the champion. The games have compatibility with the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, which originally came bundled with the games.

The games received mostly positive reviews, obtaining an aggregate score of 81 percent on Metacritic. Most critics praised the fact that the games introduced new features while still maintaining the traditional gameplay of the series. Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers complaining that they were too simplistic and lacked improvement compared to the previous games, &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12 million copies worldwide. Nearly two years after their original release, Nintendo re-marketed them as Player&#x27;s Choice titles.

==Gameplay==
As with almost all &quot;Pokémon&quot; role-playing games released for handheld consoles, &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; are in a third-person, overhead perspective. The main screen is an overworld, in which the player navigates the protagonist. Here, a menu interface may be accessed, in which the player may configure their Pokémon, items, and gameplay settings. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the player&#x27;s Pokémon and the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a move for their Pokémon to perform, use an item, switch their active Pokémon, or attempt to flee (in wild battles only). All Pokémon moves have power points (PP); when a Pokémon tries to perform a move while awake, the move&#x27;s PP is reduced by 1. When the PP of a move hits zero the Pokémon is not able to use that move. All Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon&#x27;s HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an opponent&#x27;s Pokémon faints, all of the player&#x27;s Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon will level up.

Capturing Pokémon is another essential element of the gameplay. During a battle with a wild Pokémon, the player may throw a Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the type of Poké Ball used: the lower the target&#x27;s HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture.

While &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; are remakes of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; (&quot;Pokémon Green&quot; was only released in Japan, whereas the international variant was &quot;Blue&quot;), they contain usability enhancements such as a contextual tutorial feature which allows players to look up data at any point in the game, by pressing the &quot;select&quot; button. Additionally, when continuing a saved game, players are shown the last four actions they performed, aiding in remembering what they were previously doing.

The games support the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable, through which connected players may trade or battle. Players may also connect with &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, as well as with &quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot;, allowing them to obtain over 350 Pokémon. &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; also have the ability to connect to the GameCube and interact with &quot;Pokémon Box: Ruby and Sapphire&quot;. In &quot;Pokémon Box&quot;, the player may organize and view their collected Pokémon, and in &quot;Colosseum&quot;, Pokémon may be used in battle. &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; are also the first games in the series to be compatible with the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, which comes prepackaged with the games. The adapter can be plugged into the link port of the Game Boy Advance system and allows players within a radius of to wirelessly interact with each other. In addition, as many as 30 players at a time may join a special location called the &quot;Union Room&quot;, where they can trade, battle, or chat. Nintendo set up &quot;JoySpots&quot; at Japanese retail locations for this purpose.

==Plot==
===Setting===
&quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; takes place mostly in the fictional region of Kanto. This is one distinct region of many in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; world, which includes varied geographical habitats for the Pokémon species, human-populated towns and cities, and routes between locations. Some areas are only accessible once players acquire a special item or one of their Pokémon learns a special ability. Near the end of the plot, the protagonist is able to venture to the Sevii Islands, a new area not present in the original &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; games. The Sevii Islands are an archipelago of seven islands and contain Pokémon normally exclusive to the Johto region, as well as several post-game missions. After the aforementioned missions on the Sevii Islands are completed, the ability to trade with &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; for Hoenn-exclusive Pokémon becomes available.

===Story===
The silent protagonist of &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; is a child who lives in a small town named Pallet Town. After players start a journey and venture alone into tall grass, a voice warns them to stop. Professor Samuel Oak, a famous Pokémon Researcher, explains to the player that such grass is often the habitat of wild Pokémon, and encountering them alone can be very dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where they meet Oak&#x27;s grandson, another aspiring Pokémon Trainer. The player and their rival are both instructed to select a starter Pokémon for their travels. The rival then challenges them to a Pokémon battle with their newly obtained Pokémon and continues to battle the player at certain points throughout the games.

After reaching the next city, the player is asked to deliver a parcel to Professor Oak. Upon returning to the laboratory, they are presented with a Pokédex, a high-tech encyclopedia that records the entries of any Pokémon that are captured. Oak then asks the player to fulfill his dream of compiling a comprehensive list of every Pokémon in the game.

While visiting the region&#x27;s cities, the player encounters special establishments called Pokémon Gyms. Inside these buildings are Gym Leaders, each of whom the player must defeat in a Pokémon battle to obtain a Gym Badge. Once a total of eight badges are acquired, the player is given permission to enter the Kanto Pokémon League in the Indigo Plateau, which consists of the strongest Pokémon Trainers in the region. There the player battles the Elite Four. Also throughout the game, the player has to fight against the forces of Team Rocket, a criminal organization that abuses Pokémon. They devise numerous plans to steal rare Pokémon, all of which the player must foil, meeting and defeating the organization boss Giovanni.

After the first time players defeat the Elite Four, one of the members, Lorelei, disappears. After gaining access to the Sevii Islands, an entirely new region, the player discovers Lorelei in her house and convinces her to come back with them. Once more, the protagonist must thwart Team Rocket&#x27;s plans on several occasions, recover two artifacts, the Ruby and the Sapphire, and put them in the main computer at One Island. After that, the player can trade with &quot;Ruby&quot;, &quot;Sapphire&quot;, &quot;Emerald&quot;, &quot;Colosseum&quot;, and &quot;XD&quot;.

==Development==

&quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; were first announced in September 2003 as upcoming remakes of the original &quot;Pocket Monsters Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; games that were released in Japan in 1996. Game director Junichi Masuda stated the new titles would be developed around the idea of simplicity, as the game engine was a slightly modified version of the one used in &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. As a result, &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; were made fully backward compatible with &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, allowing players to trade Pokémon between games.

&quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;″s connectivity with the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter was heralded by then-president of Nintendo Satoru Iwata as being able &quot;to enhance head-to-head battles, exchange of information, and communication with others.&quot; An enhanced interface was created for the game to increase usability for new players, as well as a contextual in-game help system that could aid lost or confused players during their journey. President of The Pokémon Company Tsunekazu Ishihara noted, &quot;We don&#x27;t feel that this a remake at all. We feel that this is a new game, with wireless technology&quot;, referring to the bundled wireless adapter.

The exclusive Japanese production run for &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; was limited to half a million copies, despite the success of &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; speculated that Nintendo was expecting less demand for the new games, or that it was limited by the production of the bundled wireless adapter. The North American versions of &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; were indirectly announced at DICE in 2004. Although the original games were released as &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in North America, the remakes retained the Japanese names of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;. Masuda noted this as a choice on his part, stating the leaf represented a peaceful icon, in contrast to the alternative of water which he saw as suggesting conflict with the icon of fire used by the other game.

===Music===
The music used in the games was derived from the classic game consoles, and arranged by Go Ichinose. Masuda and Ichinose decided not to change the reused music from the basic background sounds used in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, and instead updated them by adding additional sounds. Some of the songs have additional key changes compared to the original soundtrack and some songs such as the Trainer Battle music are re-written in MIDI for the GBA and contain pitch bends between notes. A two-disc set of the music entitled &quot;GBA Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen Super Complete&quot; was released, with the first disc featuring all the music used normally in-game, while the second disc featured bonus tracks based on and inspired by the music in the games. Among these are two vocal tracks.

==Reception==
Reviews of &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; were mostly positive, and the games currently hold an aggregate score of 81 percent on Metacritic. Jon Minife of the New Zealand Herald praised the game for resolving the connectivity issues that &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; had at the time, which would convince older players to get back into Pokémon. Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; gave the games an &quot;Outstanding&quot; 9.0/10 rating and praised the creators of the games for creating a game that &quot;works extremely well for the handheld market. It doesn&#x27;t have quite the same variety as &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, but it&#x27;s still incredibly satisfying.&quot; Harris was less positive about the games&#x27; graphics, which he thought were &quot;limited&quot; and &quot;basic&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Greg Kasavin, who gave the games 8.4 out of 10, commented that &quot;though &quot;Pokémon&quot; could probably use a few new twists after all these years, &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; are great role-playing games on their own merits, filled with lots more content and more challenges than last year&#x27;s &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, and offering up plenty of addictive gameplay that can be a lot of fun for players of all ages.&quot; Unlike Harris, Kasavin praised the games&#x27; graphics for their &quot;colorful good looks and the endearing character designs that the series is known for.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; later named &quot;LeafGreen&quot; the best Game Boy Advance game of September 2004. &quot;Game Informer&quot; rated the games a &quot;Very Good&quot; 8/10 for being &quot;a lot of fun&quot;, yet they saw the graphics as &quot;utterly unremarkable&quot; when compared to other handheld games.

&quot;GameSpy&quot; reviewer Phil Theobald, who awarded the games four out of five stars, stated, &quot;Before I knew it, I was hooked all over again. The engrossingly simple gameplay combined with the more-strategic-than-they-first-appear battles was just too much to resist. And yeah, the &#x27;gotta catch &#x27;em all&#x27; gimmick is still effective, not to mention necessary to build a well balanced party. There&#x27;s just something about tracking down, capturing, and training all those Pokémon that really draw you into the game&#x27;s world.&quot; He justified the games&#x27; graphics by comparing them to the &quot;ugly&quot; original &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; versions. Additional praise was given to the new features such as the contextual tutorial, and flashbacks when loading a saved game, as well as the games&#x27; multiplayer capabilities via the Wireless Adapter.

===Sales===
During its first week of release in Japan, &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; sold a combined total of 885,039 copies, which was less than the number sold by &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; in that time period, but &quot;IGN&quot; reasoned that the smaller sales were due to the new titles being remakes. In the first half of August before &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; were released in the United States, the games received over 150,000 pre-orders, over twice the number &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; received. Nintendo&#x27;s Senior Vice President of Marketing and Corporate Communication George Harrison remarked, &quot;This pre-sell indicates more than twice the player interest!&quot; Over one million copies of &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; were sold in the US less than one month after their release in that region. As of March 31, 2008, the games had sold 11.82 million copies worldwide. The games later entered Nintendo&#x27;s Player&#x27;s Choice line in North America and were re-marketed with a significantly lower retail price. However, unlike the original release, the Player&#x27;s Choice edition games did not include a bundled Wireless Adapter.

<text>Pokémon Stadium 2, known in Japan as is a strategy video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It is the third game in the &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; series, following prior releases &quot;Pocket Monsters Stadium&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;. It features all 251 Pokémon from the first and second generations of the franchise, and allows for players to battle either with other players or against computer-controlled opponents. Like its predecessor, &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; is compatible with the Transfer Pak accessory, allowing players to use Pokémon trained in the three original Game Boy &quot;Pokémon&quot; games (&quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot;) and the three Game Boy Color games (&quot;Pokémon Gold&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Crystal&quot;).

&quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; was produced as a result of the popularity and strong sales of the series&#x27; prior entry, &quot;Pokémon Stadium,&quot; and demonstrated publicly during the 2000 Nintendo Space World trade show. Several publications considered its release to be part of marketing for the series&#x27; popularity at the time. The game was released in 2000 in Japan and 2001 worldwide.

The game received largely positive reviews from critics, who highlighted its graphics and the amount of content available, though many found the game similar to its predecessor. Criticism was directed to the fact that many felt it was better suited to fans of the series than a casual audience, and that a full experience of the game necessitated the use of Transfer Pak capabilities.

Following the release of the game, no further games in the &quot;Stadium&quot; series were released, though games with similar gameplay to the series were released afterward. The game was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2023.

==Gameplay==

Like prior entries in the series, &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; utilizes turn-based RPG gameplay. Teams of up to six fictional creatures called Pokémon can be used in battle, either against computer controlled opponents, or against other players. Players can use these creatures&#x27; special moves against an opposing Pokémon, with these moves having many effects, such as doing damage or by inflicting status conditions; for example, a Pokémon can be poisoned, which causes it to take small amounts of additional damage each turn. Pokémon are also affected by elemental &quot;types&quot;, which affects how much damage a species may take from a given attack. For example, a Grass-typed Pokémon takes more damage from a Fire-typed attack than it would another move. Players can also switch out their active Pokémon for another in their team, though this uses up their turn.

&quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; does not have a storyline. Progress can be made by winning trophies in the Stadium, a tournament mode consisting of four &quot;Cups&quot;, as well as completing the Gym Leader Castle, where the player earns badges by defeating Gym Leader characters who first appeared in the various Game Boy &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, culminating in a battle against the character Red. When all Stadium trophies have been won and the Gym Leader Castle is completed, the player&#x27;s rival will want to battle. Defeating the rival will unlock Round 2, in which the player must re-challenge the Stadium, Gym Leader Castle, and the Rival at a higher difficulty level. Players can also utilize the &quot;Battle Now!&quot; mode to engage in quick battles with random Pokémon, while Free Battle mode allows players to either practice on their own or against another player. Up to four players can battle each other, though players must share control of a team with another player if more than two participate. If players play as a tag team, players select three Pokémon each from a team of six; players can only swap Pokémon out with their partner&#x27;s, at which point the partner controls the Pokémon on the field.

===Additional features===

The Mini-Game Park mode allows up to four players to play twelve different Pokémon-themed mini-games. There are a large number of mini-games, such as a game where a top-like Pokémon named Hitmontop must be used to knock other Hitmontop off of the arena, and a game where a Pokémon named Delibird must sort and deliver gifts, with the player who delivers the most gifts being crowned the winner. Players can use their Pokémon from the Game Boy games in these mini-games instead of the standard species; for instance, a player can use their own Scizor in the species&#x27; respective mini-game. A new mode, called &quot;Mini-Game Champion&quot;, allows players to play these mini-games while also attempting to collect coins, with the player with the most coins being crowned the winner. Mini-Game Champion also features event-based mechanics, similarly to the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series; one event is capable of causing players to lose some of their coins and give them to other players. &quot;Stadium 2&quot; also introduces quizzes, which allows players to answer Pokémon-themed questions to see how many can be answered while under a time limit. Quizzes can also be played with multiple players, and difficulty options for questions can be selected.

The Game Boy Tower feature returns from the prior entry, &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;. Using the Transfer Pak, players can connect to the games &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Crystal&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Red, Blue,&quot; and &quot;Yellow&quot; and transfer their Pokémon from those games into &quot;Stadium 2.&quot; Once transferred, players can use these Pokémon in battles in &quot;Stadium 2&quot;. Additionally, players can use the Pak to play the Game Boy games on the Nintendo 64 console. The Pokémon Laboratory mode also returns, which allows players to organize their Pokémon storage in the Game Boy games through &quot;Stadium 2&quot;, as well as view 3D world maps of the Game Boy games and all 251 species&#x27; 3D models. Players can also use the lab to trade Pokemon between the Game Boy games without the need for a Game Link Cable.

Other features include Earl&#x27;s Pokémon Academy, which teaches players about battling mechanics, the player&#x27;s room, a 3D environment which can be decorated with plushies and posters, among other items, and the Mystery Gift function, which allows players with &quot;Stadium 2&quot; to send items to &quot;Gold, Silver,&quot; or &quot;Crystal&quot; once a day. In the Japanese version of &quot;Pokémon Crystal&quot;, players could use the Mobile Adapter GB peripheral to battle other players remotely over the Mobile System GB network service; replays of these battles could then be recorded and transferred to &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; &quot;Mobile Stadium&quot; mode to be viewed in 3D.

==Development and release==
&quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;, known in Japan as &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot;, sold highly and was popular enough to be included in bundles for the Nintendo 64 console. The success led to the development of a third entry. Scheduled for a late 2000 release, the game was demonstrated publicly at the 2000 Nintendo Space World festival. It was considered by &quot;IGN&quot; to be part of a large franchise-wide marketing push, coupled alongside the release of &quot;Pokémon the Movie 2000&quot;, and &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; considered the game to be part of a larger push to capitalize on the success of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise&#x27;s first generation.

By July 20, 2000, the game&#x27;s title was changed from &quot;Pokémon Stadium 3&quot; to &quot;Pokémon Stadium Gold/Silver&quot;. Nintendo announced more information on October 3, including the dates of the Japanese release and official tournaments. On October 25, Nintendo set the game&#x27;s North American release date for March 26, 2001. The game was released in Japan on December 14, 2000, and later released in 2001 globally. The game had a marketing budget of $7 million. Following its release, the game became the 18th best-selling Nintendo 64 video game, with a reported shipment of 2,540,000 units. It was the tenth highest selling video game of 2001.

==Reception==
&quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; holds a 78% score on the review aggregate website Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. GameRankings rated it 73.31% based on 18 reviews.

&quot;GamePro&quot; stated that the game would be an enjoyable experience for fans of the series, finding the game to be an upgrade to its predecessor&#x27;s. Gerald Villoria, in a review for &quot;GameSpot,&quot; found the game to require the Game Boy compatibility to get a complete experience, but was a strong release alongside the Game Boy games. He highlighted several aspects of the game, such as its accessibility for new players and the animations and models for the Pokémon, though criticized the game&#x27;s lackluster soundtrack, sound effects, and announcer. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s three-person review stated that the game was a strong release for fans of the series, but those without a Transfer Pak or a strong attachment to the series would not be as interested in the game. They also found its gameplay incredibly similar to the previous entry in the series.

&quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Tom Bramwell found the game&#x27;s gameplay to be highly repetitive, and that only those who deeply enjoyed the series and its gameplay would enjoy it. He highlighted Earl&#x27;s Battle Academy and the ability to play the Game Boy games on the television as positives for the game. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Chris Carle stated that while the game had a large number of options available to the player, and that the release was improved greatly from the previous installment, players without the Transfer Pak would lack much excitement with the game. He also criticized the game&#x27;s announcer, finding it to be a negative carried across from the previous entry. In a retrospective review from &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;, writer Arjun Joshi stated that nearly every part of the game included in &quot;Stadium&quot; was improved in some way in the sequel, though he felt that the game&#x27;s soundtrack was a downgrade, and that the game featured a lack of revamped graphics from its predecessor.

&quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; was a nominee for &quot;11th Annual GamePro Readers&#x27; Choice Awards&quot; for &quot;Best Action Game of the Year&quot;, but lost to &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; for PlayStation 2.

== Legacy ==
Following the release of &quot;Stadium 2,&quot; no other games in the &quot;Stadium&quot; series were released, though games with similar gameplay followed. According to Game Freak employees Shigeru Ohmori and Junichi Masuda, the &quot;Stadium&quot; series&#x27; main feature of allowing for Pokémon battles in 3D was not considered as &quot;impressive&quot; as it was before, primarily due to the release of &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, the first mainline &quot;Pokémon&quot; games to feature entirely 3D graphics. They stated it would require &quot;some sort of new invention&quot; to justify the series&#x27; return. &quot;Stadium 2&quot; was later re-released via Nintendo Switch Online in 2023. The re-release functions identically to the original, though players are unable to use the game&#x27;s Transfer Pak features.

<doc id="431301" wikidata="Q835937" url="?curid=431301" title="Mirror writing">
<text>Mirror writing is formed by writing in the direction that is the reverse of the natural way for a given language, such that the result is the mirror image of normal writing: it appears normal when reflected in a mirror. It is sometimes used as an extremely primitive form of cipher. A common modern usage of mirror writing can be found on the front of ambulances, where the word &quot;AMBULANCE&quot; is often written in very large mirrored text, so that drivers see the word the right way around in their rear-view mirror. It is also on fire engines and police cars too.

Some people are able to produce handwritten mirrored text. Notably, Leonardo da Vinci wrote most of his personal notes in this way.
Mirror writing calligraphy was popular in the Ottoman Empire, where it often carried mystical associations.

==Ability to write mirrored text==

An informal Australian newspaper experiment identified 10 true mirror-writers in a readership of 65,000. A higher proportion of left-handed people are better mirror writers than right-handed people, perhaps because it is more natural for a left-hander to write from right to left. 15% of left-handed people have the language centres in both halves of their brain. The cerebral cortex and motor homunculus are affected by this, causing the person to be able to read and write backwards quite naturally.

In an experiment conducted by the Department of Neurosurgery at Hokkaido University School of Medicine in Sapporo, Japan, scientists proposed that the origin of mirror writing comes from damage caused through brain trauma or neurological diseases, such as an essential tremor, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, or spino-cerebellar degeneration. This hypothesis was proposed because these conditions affect a &quot;neural mechanism that controls the higher cerebral function of writing via the thalamus.&quot;
Another study by the same university discovered that damage was not the only cause. The scientists observed that normal children exhibited signs of mirror writing while learning to write, thus concluding that currently there is no exact method for finding the true origin of mirror writing.

==Notable examples==

Leonardo da Vinci wrote most of his personal notes in mirror writing, only using standard writing if he intended his texts to be read by others. The purpose of this practice by Leonardo remains unknown, though several possible reasons have been suggested. For example, writing left handed from left to right would have been messy because the ink just put down would smudge as his hand moved across it. Writing in reverse would prevent such smudging. An alternative theory is that the process of rotating the linguistic object in memory before setting it to paper, and rotating it before reading it back, was a method of reinforcement learning. From this theory, it follows the use of boustrophedonic writing, especially in public codes, may be to render better recall of the text in the reader.

Matteo Zaccolini may have written his original four volume treatise on optics, color, and perspective in the early 17th century in mirror script.
Pictorial texts also known as calligrams arranged in mirror symmetry were popular in the Ottoman Empire during the 18th and 19th centuries among the Bektashi order, where it often carried mystical associations. The origins of this mirror writing tradition may date to the pre-Islamic period in rock inscriptions of the western Arabian peninsula. A recent study that has revealed the oldest examples of mirror writing in Greek traces the early appearance of mirror inscriptions to Late Antiquity, specifically to Syria-Palestine, Egypt, and Constantinople. In Islamic art, mirror calligraphy is known as muthanna or musanna.

Peep show images shown in a zograscope have headers in mirror writing.

<doc id="431302" wikidata="Q773745" url="?curid=431302" title="Salvador Pineda">
<text>Salvador Pineda Popoca (born June 16, 1952, in Huetamo, Michoacan, Mexico) is a Mexican actor, who has participated in over 20 Mexican telenovelas and Mexican movies, as well as two Hollywood low budget movies. Born to Mexican politician Salvador Pineda who served under Mexican President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, and Gloria Pineda, house-wife. His uncle (on his mother&#x27;s side) is the renowned Mexican cardiologist Ignacio Chavez Sanchez.

==Biography==
Salvador Pineda is known for his acting on many Televisa soap operas, including 1980s &quot;Colorina&quot; with Lucía Méndez, and &quot;Mi Pequeña Soledad&quot; with Verónica Castro. He is also remembered for his soap opera &quot;Tu o Nadie&quot; with Lucía Mendez and Andrés García. Pineda and García were considered two of the sexiest Latino actors of the 1980s, appearing in shirtless photos in magazines sold in Latin America.

Pineda&#x27;s identifiable, gravelly voice and his physique led to his being type-cast as a villain, or, less frequently as a gruff, edgy heroic lead.

Pineda began his internationalization in 1984, when he worked in Puerto Rico as the star of canal 2&#x27;s &quot;Coralito&quot;, with Sully Diaz. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1985, to film another telenovela with &quot;canal 2&quot;.

Pineda also made an attempt at a singing career, having released one CD. He is divorced from Venezuelan actress Mayra Alejandra.
He has a daughter, but is very private about it.

<text>Elijah Abel, or Able or Ables (July 25, 1808– December 25, 1884) was one of the earliest African-American members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and was the church&#x27;s first African-American elder and Seventy. Abel was predominantly of Scottish and English descent and appears to have been the first, and one of the few, black members in the early history of the church to have received Priesthood ordination, later becoming the faith&#x27;s first black missionary. Abel did not have his ordination revoked when the LDS Church officially announced its now-obsolete restrictions on Priesthood ordination, but was denied a chance to receive his temple endowment by third church president John Taylor. As a skilled carpenter, Abel often committed his services to the building of LDS temples and chapels. He died in 1884 after serving a mission to Cincinnati, Ohio, his last of three total missions for the church.

==Early life==
Elijah Abel was born in Frederick-Town, Maryland, on July 25, 1808, to Delilah Williams and Andrew Abel. There is some confusion surrounding Abel&#x27;s birth year, given that some sources put the year at 1808 and others at 1810. However, the 1850 Census record marks 1808 as the year of Abel&#x27;s birth, and both Abel&#x27;s patriarchal blessing and grave marker record 1808 as his birth year. His mother was of Scottish descent and his father of English descent; one of his grandmothers was &quot;half white&quot;, or mulatto, and thus Abel was considered to be &quot;octoroon,&quot; or one-eighth African.

Abel&#x27;s mother died when he was 8 years old. Some believed that she was a slave from South Carolina, but evidence for this has never been produced. Others have also speculated, based on the unproven assumption that Abel was the son of a slave, that he at some point migrated to Canada by way of the Underground Railroad. Apart from circumstantial evidence, this claim remains entirely unsubstantiated, apart from a few sources stating that Abel spent some time in Canada in his early adulthood.

==Conversion to the LDS faith==
Abel later moved to Ohio, and in Cincinnati he was baptized and confirmed a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in September 1832. He was baptized by local Mormon elder and blacksmith Ezekiel Roberts. Shortly after his baptism, Abel moved to the area of Kirtland, Ohio, to join in fellowship with the main body of church members congregating there.

===Priesthood ordination and church participation===
Abel was ordained an elder of the LDS Church on January 25, 1836, following Joseph Smith&#x27;s declaration in 1836 that Abel was &quot;entitled to the Priesthood and all the blessings.&quot; He had been an active participant in the construction of the Kirtland Temple over the preceding months. Abel participated in the &quot;Pentecostal season&quot; that accompanied the completion and dedication of the Kirtland Temple in 1836. In December of that year, 11 months after his priesthood ordination, Abel was ordained a seventy and inducted into the Third Quorum of the priesthood. In 1841, Abel was reconfirmed in Nauvoo by Joseph Young and Albert P. Rockwood. Abel was among the first church members to receive the ordinance of the initiatory in the Kirtland Temple following its dedication in 1836.

==== Patriarchal blessing ====
Abel received his patriarchal blessing from Presiding Patriarch Joseph Smith Sr., which was recorded by LDS Church scribe and newspaper editor Warren A. Cowdery. At the time, the common practice when giving patriarchal blessings was to declare an individual to be a descendant of a specific tribe of Israel. Abel, however, was declared an &quot;orphan&quot; from a father who &quot;hath never done his duty toward [him]&quot;, but it was stated in the blessing that Abel would &quot;be made equal to [his] brethren, and [his] soul be white in eternity and [his] robes glittering.&quot; Since the recorded blessing does not specifically declare his tribal lineage, Abel was perhaps &quot;adopted&quot; into the House of Israel. The blessing also included what seemed to be a foreshadowing of the civil war that would soon strike at the heart of the country:

&quot;Thou shalt see [the destroyer&#x27;s] power in laying waste the nations, &amp; the wicked slaying the wicked, while blood shall run down the streets like water, and thy heart shall weep over their calamities. Angels shall visit thee and thou shalt receive comfort. They shall call thee blessed and deliver thee from thine enemies. They shall break thy bands and keep thee from afflictions.&quot;

===Mission to Upper Canada===
During the late 1830s, Abel labored as a missionary in New York and Upper Canada, and preached among the African-American population in those areas. In 1838, Abel baptized 25-year-old Eunice Ross Kinney while serving in St. Lawrence County, New York, who after Abel&#x27;s death remembered him as a &quot;powerful&quot; minister, and one who had been &quot;ordained by Joseph the martyr&quot;. Abel taught Kinney and others he baptized that &quot;the time was drawing near for [Christ&#x27;s] coming&quot;, but that He would not come &quot;till God had a people prepared to receive Him, with all the gifts and blessings that adorned His church anciently.&quot; In his ministry, Abel often quoted the Apostle Peter: &quot;Think it not strange, brethren, concerning the fiery trials which are to try you...&quot;.

Due to civil unrest and rebellion in Upper Canada, Abel&#x27;s missionary travels were frequently punctuated with dangerous situations and persecutions. Such circumstances were certainly not unfamiliar to many Mormon missionaries of the time, nor to their leaders. At one point during his mission, Abel was falsely accused of the murder of a family of six, and aggressively pursued by a mob bearing hot tar and feathers.

==Time in Nauvoo, temple building and civil marriage==
Abel moved from Kirtland to Commerce (later renamed Nauvoo), Illinois, in 1839 upon returning from his mission to Canada. He came to own a piece of property located northwest of the city on the banks of the Mississippi River. While living in Nauvoo, Abel continued to further immerse himself in church work and activity, and is known to have performed at least two baptisms for the dead by proxy: one for a friend by the name of &quot;John F. Lancaster&quot;, and one for his mother, Delilah. One of Abel&#x27;s duties included acting as an undertaker at the request of Joseph Smith—responsible for the fashioning of coffins and the digging of graves—in response to the malaria epidemic of 1839–40. Abel continued to work as a carpenter; he was a member of the group called the House Carpenters of the Town of Nauvoo.

During Abel&#x27;s time in Nauvoo he became personally acquainted with Joseph Smith. As part of Abel&#x27;s priesthood license, Joseph wrote that he recommended Abel as his &quot;worthy brother in the Lord&quot;, one who is &quot;duly authorized&quot; to spread the gospel in a manner &quot;equal to the authority of that Office&quot;. In June 1841, Abel and six other men quickly mobilized themselves as an expeditionary militia force to attempt the rescue of Smith after his unlawful arrest by state officers at Quincy, Illinois. By the time they reached Quincy, however, Smith had obtained a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and had been returned safely to Nauvoo.

In 1842, Abel left the deed to his Nauvoo property to William Marks and returned to Cincinnati on assignment by Joseph Smith. There, he continued his carpentry and boarded for a time with a local painter named John Price on Eighth Street. Abel continued to act as a leader of the church in Cincinnati, and was recognized as such by Joseph Smith, who pronounced to Orson Hyde and others: &quot;Go to Cincinnati... and find an educated negro, who rides in his carriage, and you will see a man who has risen by the power of his own mind to his exalted state of respectability.&quot;

=== Marriage ===
On February 16, 1847, the 39-year-old Abel married 17-year-old Mary Ann Adams of Tennessee, who was residing in Ohio. Adams was also one-eighth African-American. Little is known about Adams, other than the date of her marriage to Abel and her residency status in both Tennessee and Ohio. The couple had eight known children: three were born in Cincinnati—Moroni, Enoch, and Anna Rebecca—and five more in Utah Territory—Delilah, Mary, Elijah Jr., Maggie, and Flora. They also took into their home a young woman (about the age of their oldest son) named Rola from Ohio, whom they later adopted.

==Migration and later years in Utah==
In May 1853, Abel and his family departed from Keokuk, Iowa, and migrated as part of the Appleton M. Harmon pioneer company to Utah Territory, where the new headquarters of the LDS Church were located. After the company&#x27;s arrival in the Salt Lake Valley on October 17, Abel&#x27;s family moved to Millcreek, a few miles south of Salt Lake City. Abel continued to work as a carpenter as part of the LDS public works program and assisted in the construction of the Salt Lake Temple. By 1860, the Abel family had moved to Salt Lake City&#x27;s Thirteenth Ward and lived only a short distance from the Temple Block.

Abel remained a member of the Seventy and continued to be active in the church in Utah. Along with his wife and oldest son, Abel was rebaptized on March 15, 1857, as part of the Mormon Reformation. During the mass southern migration of LDS Church members in 1858 to avoid conflict with Johnston&#x27;s invading army during the Utah War, Abel stayed behind with other watchmen who had been tasked with setting fire to the emptied city should the invaders make any false move; the U.S. troops marched through Salt Lake City without incident and the city remained intact.

Abel and his wife managed the Farnham House hotel, which was advertised as a &quot;first class&quot; boarding house that boasted &quot;good stabling and corrals&quot;. By 1862, Abel and his family had relocated to the Tenth Ward in Salt Lake City. Very little is known about the personal lives of the Abel family. In 1870 they moved to Ogden, Utah, for a short time before returning to Salt Lake City. Utah residents during this period remembered the Abel family as traveling up and down the Wasatch front (a mountain valley stretch of contiguous towns from Provo to Ogden) entertaining audiences with their minstrel shows:

It seems most likely that Abel played the fiddle or violin, while the family – including eight children between the ages of about one and twenty years old – acted, danced, sang, or played along with their father on other instruments. &quot;There was a family of colored folks by the name of Able [&quot;sic&quot;],&quot; remembered one Utah resident, &quot;who went around from ward to ward and put on performances for the public.&quot;

In 1871, Abel&#x27;s son Moroni passed away, followed by Abel&#x27;s wife in 1877 from pneumonia. Abel remained a faithful member of the LDS Church throughout his life and served a final mission to Ohio and Canada in 1883–84, during which he became ill. His worsening health resulted in his return to Utah in December 1884. Abel died two weeks after his return, on Christmas Day. His body was interred at the Salt Lake City Cemetery alongside his wife, and his original grave marker is inscribed with the words: &quot;Elijah Able—At Rest.&quot;

== Disputes over priesthood ==

===Meeting in Cincinnati, 1843===
On June 25, 1843, a regional conference occurred in Cincinnati presided over by LDS Church apostles John E. Page, Orson Pratt, Heber C. Kimball, and future-apostle Lorenzo Snow. During the conference, questions regarding Abel and his membership were addressed, including the acknowledgement of recent complaints about Abel&#x27;s public preaching activity. Page stated that while &quot;he respected a coloured Brother, wisdom forbid that we should introduce [him] before the public.&quot; Pratt and Kimball supported Page&#x27;s statements, and the leaders resolved to restrict Abel&#x27;s activities as a member of the church.

While previously in Canada, Abel&#x27;s activity to encourage flight from Canada and its civil uprisings to the American &quot;Zion&quot; was viewed with disdain, and was seen by the Canadians as &quot;pro-American sympathizing&quot;. The former missionary associates who accused him cited Abel&#x27;s claims &quot;that there would be stakes of Zion in all the world&quot;. However, despite these allegations of teaching what was perceived by some to be &quot;false doctrine&quot;, no disciplinary action was taken against Abel. At the conclusion of the conference, Abel was called to serve a second mission locally, but he was instructed to visit and teach &quot;only the coloured population&quot;. The leaders of the conference in Cincinnati made no statement that the resolution of the meeting had been based on divine revelation or that it constituted any sort of doctrinal mandate, but rather they deemed it prudent to address the dynamic racial and politically turbulent climate of the times.

===The 1849 priesthood ban===

In 1849, Brigham Young issued a church-wide ban on black men from being ordained to the priesthood. The policy&#x27;s initial reveal by Young to the Twelve may have occurred up to two years earlier at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. Young&#x27;s pronouncements in 1849 constitute the earliest known statements which officially exclude those of African descent from a temple endowment or the wielding of priesthood power. This decision may have been brought about in part by the actions of William McCary, an African-American convert to the church living in Cincinnati, who believed he was a prophet and claimed on various occasions to be Jesus and Adam, father of the human race. In 1847, as the Saints resided at Winter Quarters, McCary was excommunicated, following the discovery of various unauthorized polygamous sealings performed in his home. As members of the LDS Church continued to migrate to the West, Mormons were exposed to a larger population of blacks, and anti-black political attitudes continued to increase among church members. Other black members of the church such as Q. Walker Lewis also found themselves and their church membership under scrutiny during this period.

By 1847, Abel&#x27;s priesthood authority had begun to be challenged, despite his well-respected status within the church community. Even after the 1849 official prohibition for all Latter-day Saint &quot;brethren of color,&quot; Abel remained involved in the church. As one who already held the priesthood, he continued to serve as a seventy in Cincinnati from 1842 to 1853, and in the autumn of 1883 served another mission to Cincinnati shortly before his death.

====Denial of temple ordinances====
After moving to Utah Territory, Abel asked Brigham Young for permission to be sealed to his wife and children, which was denied. Abel again requested a sealing five years later to his deceased wife, son, and daughter—this time from President John Taylor, who then passed it on for the body of the Twelve to consider. Abel&#x27;s request was again refused, and he was not allowed to enter the temple to be endowed.

===1879 meeting regarding Joseph Smith&#x27;s statements===
On May 31, 1879, a meeting was held at the residence of Provo mayor Abraham O. Smoot to discuss the conflicting versions of Joseph Smith&#x27;s views on black men and the priesthood, in response to Abel&#x27;s petition to be sealed to his recently deceased wife. Abel had first been ordained to the priesthood by Ambrose Palmer in January 1836, then as a Seventy by Zebedee Coltrin in December of the same year. Coltrin claimed, however, that Abel had been ordained as a Seventy in exchange for his work on the temples at Kirtland and Nauvoo, but that Joseph Smith had later realized his &quot;error&quot; and promptly &quot;dropped&quot; Abel from the quorum because of &quot;his lineage&quot;. Coltrin reported having this conversation with Joseph Smith in 1834—yet Abel had not received the priesthood nor had been made a Seventy until 1836, and construction had not even begun on the Nauvoo Temple until 1841, thus making it impossible to have been &quot;dropped&quot; from any such capacity in 1834. Joseph F. Smith contradicted Coltrin by pointing out that he had verified as being in Abel&#x27;s possession two certificates which notarized his 1836 and 1841 priesthood licensings that declared Abel to be an elder of the church and a seventy.

The &quot;Smoot meeting&quot; was essentially a reaffirmation of the church&#x27;s 1849 policy of excluding black men from receiving the priesthood. Beyond suddenly bringing into question Abel&#x27;s long-held authority in a high-profile and likely humiliating setting, the meeting did not change the fact that Abel held the priesthood.

===1879 meetings with Taylor, Smith, and the Seventy===
In 1879, Abel was present at two separate meetings regarding his priesthood authority. At these meetings Abel had addressed the church members and authorities present and reflected upon his nearly 45 years of experience as a priesthood-bearing Latter-day Saint. He had also recounted &quot;his appointment an[d] ordination as a Seventy, and a member of the 3rd Quorum.&quot; Abel recalled for them Joseph&#x27;s personal words to him: &quot;that those… called to the Melchisadec [&quot;sic&quot;] Priesthood [having] magnified that calling would be sealed up unto eternal life.&quot; At these meetings, Abel himself defended his priesthood before church authorities, outlining its timeline and reaffirming that Joseph Smith himself had told him he was &quot;entitled to the priesthood&quot;. Abel expressed to President Taylor his lifelong hope that his endowment of priesthood might prove one day &quot;the welding link&quot; to bond all of God&#x27;s people together regardless of race. At the end of these meetings, John Taylor concluded that Joseph Smith had made &quot;an exception&quot; and had given Abel the priesthood despite his race—perhaps because he was of primarily European descent, and perhaps because he had further proved his worthiness by helping to advance and to build the early church. Taylor moved to honor Smith&#x27;s decision and ruled that Abel&#x27;s priesthood would be &quot;allowed to remain&quot;.

===Posthumous commentary on Abel&#x27;s priesthood===
After Abel&#x27;s death, LDS Church president Joseph F. Smith on multiple occasions declared Abel&#x27;s ordination to the priesthood as &quot;null and void by [Joseph Smith] himself because of his blackness&quot;, suggesting based on Coltrin&#x27;s previous testimony that Joseph Smith before his death had indeed repented of his initial decision that Abel receive the priesthood. Scarcely a few years had passed since Joseph F. Smith had himself been the one to ordain Abel and to set him apart to serve his final church mission. Apostle Joseph Fielding Smith, who later became president of the church, went so far as to suggest that there had been two Elijah Abels – one white and one black.

==Legacy==
Following Abel&#x27;s death in 1884, his life and ordination to the priesthood remained a topic of conversation and debate for decades. The circumstance and story of Elijah Abel often were referenced with the rise of questions concerning black men receiving the priesthood or temple blessings. All eligible men within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were admitted to the priesthood beginning in 1978, when all former restrictions based on race were lifted with the revelation received by then-prophet and church president Spencer W. Kimball. Long before this, however, Abel&#x27;s son and grandson, Enoch and Elijah, had both been ordained already to the Melchizedek priesthood; Enoch was ordained an elder on November 27, 1900, and Elijah to the same office on September 29, 1935.

In 2002, a monument was erected in Salt Lake City over Abel&#x27;s gravesite by the Missouri Mormon Frontier Foundation and the Genesis Group, to memorialize Abel, his wife, and his descendants. The monument was dedicated by LDS Church Apostle M. Russell Ballard.

<text>A chemical engineer is a professional equipped with the knowledge of chemistry and other basic sciences who works principally in the chemical industry to convert basic raw materials into a variety of products and deals with the design and operation of plants and equipment. This person applies the principles of chemical engineering in any of its various practical applications, such as

# Design, manufacture, and operation of plants and machinery in industrial chemical and related processes (&quot;chemical process engineers&quot;);
# Development of new or adapted substances for products ranging from foods and beverages to cosmetics to cleaners to pharmaceutical ingredients, among many other products (&quot;chemical product engineers&quot;);
# Development of new technologies such as fuel cells, hydrogen power and nanotechnology, as well as working in fields wholly or partially derived from chemical engineering such as materials science, polymer engineering, and biomedical engineering. This can include working of geophysical projects such as rivers, stones, and signs.

==History==

The president of the Institution of Chemical Engineers said in his presidential address &quot;I believe most of us would be willing to regard Edward Charles Howard (1774–1816) as the first chemical engineer of any eminence&quot;. Others have suggested Johann Rudolf Glauber (1604–1670) for his development of processes for the manufacture of the major industrial acids.

The term appeared in print in 1839, though from the context it suggests a person with mechanical engineering knowledge working in the chemical industry. 
In 1880, George E. Davis wrote in a letter to &quot;Chemical News&quot; &quot;A Chemical Engineer is a person who possesses chemical and mechanical knowledge, and who applies that knowledge to the utilisation, on a manufacturing scale, of chemical action.&quot; He proposed the name Society of Chemical Engineers, for what was in fact constituted as the Society of Chemical Industry. At the first General Meeting of the Society in 1882, some 15 of the 300 members described themselves as chemical engineers, but the Society&#x27;s formation of a Chemical Engineering Group in 1918 attracted about 400 members.

In 1905 a publication called &quot;The Chemical Engineer&quot; was founded in the US, and in 1908 the American Institute of Chemical Engineers was established.

In 1924 the Institution of Chemical Engineers adopted the following definition: &quot;A chemical engineer is a professional man experienced in the design, construction and operation of plant and works in which matter undergoes a change of state and composition.&quot;

As can be seen from the later definition, the occupation is not limited to the chemical industry, but more generally the process industries, or other situations in which complex physical and/or chemical processes are to be managed.

The UK journal &quot;The Chemical Engineer&quot; (began 1956) has a series of biographies available online entitled “Chemical Engineers who Changed the World”,

== Overview ==

Historically, the chemical engineer has been primarily concerned with process engineering, which can generally be divided into two complementary areas: chemical reaction engineering and separation processes. The modern discipline of chemical engineering, however, encompasses much more than just process engineering. Chemical engineers are now engaged in the development and production of a diverse range of products, as well as in commodity and specialty chemicals. These products include high-performance materials needed for aerospace, automotive, biomedical, electronic, environmental and military applications. Examples include ultra-strong fibers, fabrics, adhesives and composites for vehicles, bio-compatible materials for implants and prosthetics, gels for medical applications, pharmaceuticals, and films with special dielectric, optical or spectroscopic properties for opto-electronic devices. Additionally, chemical engineering is often intertwined with biology and biomedical engineering. Many chemical engineers work on biological projects such as understanding biopolymers (proteins) and mapping the human genome. 

== Employments and salaries==
According to a 2015 salary survey by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the median annual salary for a chemical engineer was approximately $127,000. The survey was repeated in 2017 and the median annual salary dropped slightly to $124,000. The decrease in median salary was unexpected. A factor contributing to the decline may be that 2017’s survey was conducted by a different research and analysis firm. Median salaries ranged from $70,450 for chemical engineers with fewer than three years of experience to $156,000 for those with more than 40 years in the workforce.

In the UK, the IChemE 2016 Salary Survey reported a median salary of approximately £57,000, with a starting salary for a graduate averaging £28,350. Chemical engineering in the USA is one of the engineering disciplines with the highest participation of women, with 35% of students compared with 20% in engineering. In the UK in 2014, students starting degrees were 25% female, compared with 15% in engineering. US graduates who responded to a 2015 salary survey were 18.8% female.

According to the latest 2023 figures, Bayes Business School graduates get an average of £51,921 within 5 years of graduation, which is the most among UK universities. This was followed by the University of Oxford at £49,086 and the University of Warwick at £47,446.

<doc id="431315" wikidata="Q377174" url="?curid=431315" title="VLS-1 V03">
<text>The 2003 Alcântara VLS accident was an accident during the Brazilian Space Agency&#x27;s third attempt to launch the VLS-1 rocket, which was intended to launch two satellites into orbit. The rocket ignited on its launch pad at the Alcântara Launch Center, killing 21 people. It is the fourth deadliest space exploration related disaster in history.

==Background==
The rocket, proposed in 1979 had until the accident two launch attempts: one in 1997, which ended up in the Atlantic Ocean due to the failure of one of the first stage engines to start and another in 1999, destroyed remotely due to a flame penetrating the top of the second stage block 3 minutes after takeoff.

==Operation São Luís==
Besides being the third flight of the VLS-1, the operation had as objectives the launch of the satellites UNOSAT and SATEC in to orbit; verify the CLA&#x27;s ability to perform type launches and the use of the CLBI as a tracking station. The transportation of materials for V03 started on August 23, 2002 and stopped on April 16, 2003. The operation was restarted on July 1, an inspection the next day found no problems, and the satellites were transported on the 30th. After several assembly operations, the accident occurred on August 22, 2003.

==Accident==
The accident occurred three days before the scheduled launch date, at 1:26:06 pm (Brasília time) on August 22, 2003, between frames 26 and 27 recorded by the Closed Circuit TV of the Mobile Integration Tower. An unplanned ignition destroyed the launch vehicle while on the CLA platform. 21 people died due to the ignition of a first stage engine. It took about eight seconds before the tower was enveloped by smoke and gases heated up to 3,000 °C. The mobile tower stood upright for five minutes.

Survivors reported the noise of at least one booster running and several loud bangs.

Due to the scale of the event, the dead were identified through a roll call and the remains were identified and sent to the IML on August 23, 2003. On the same day, the base was reopened to the press.

At the same time that the accident occurred, the president of AEB Luiz Bevilacqua, was giving a press conference about the agreement signed between Brazil and Ukraine for the use of the Alcântara base. Being informed of the accident by journalists, he ironically said, &quot;Only if it&#x27;s a St. John&#x27;s rocket&quot;. It was identified that the ignition process occurred prematurely, and thus the launch tower was not removed in time, which was the main cause of the fire. The accident considerably delayed the Brazilian space program.

==Investigation==
The Military Police Inquiry was opened on August 26, 2003, and the Technical Investigation Commission was appointed on August 28, 2003. The investigation involved Russia at the request of the Ministry of Defense, and was answered by sending six technicians from the Russian Aerospace Agency. The families of the victims have even called for an independent investigation, something that the then president Lula has not commented on, but he has announced that he would send a bill to compensate the victims&#x27; families. A Special Commission of the House of Representatives visited the base on October 20. The compensation was approved by the House on October 28, 2003. Despite evidence of French espionage in Maranhão, no evidence of sabotage was found.

The conclusion of both the Brazilian and Russian investigators was that the cause of the accident was due to the unplanned start of the A-booster. Among the possible causes of the ignition, they raised the possibility of static electricity, with the Russian experts noting the absence of a bridge between the propellant and the propellant housing, but it was considered a low probability event due to the non-occurrence of lightning on the day. The electrostatic discharge hypothesis was found to be superior, due to the absence of a barrier between the first stage boosters.

==Results==
The integration tower, which cost R$6.5 million in 1995, cost about R$10 million to rebuild. The launch tower was completed and delivered in 2012, but in 2013 the base had not yet finished its reconstruction. A mock-up of the VLS-1 was tested on the tower in 2012, But in 2016 it was decided to end the VLS program in favor of the VLM. The VLS-1 V04 even had 70% of its structure completed, but was canceled with the end of the program.

==Victims==
The accident killed 21 civilians who were working at the time of the fire.

<text>The , abbreviated as PTCG or Pokémon TCG, is a tabletop and collectible card game developed by Creatures Inc. based on the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. Originally published in Japan by Media Factory in 1996, publishing worldwide is currently handled by The Pokémon Company. In the United States and also by Gopu
, &quot;Pokémon TCG&quot; publishing was originally licensed to Wizards of the Coast, the producer of &quot;&quot;. Wizards published eight expansion sets between 1998 and 2003, after which point licensing was transferred to The Pokémon Company.

Players assume the role of Pokémon Trainers engaging in battle, and play with 60-card decks. Standard gameplay cards include Pokémon cards, Energy cards, and Trainer cards. Pokémon are introduced in battle from a &quot;bench&quot; and perform attacks on their opponent to deplete their health points. Attacks are enabled by the attachment of a sufficient number of Energy cards to the active Pokémon. Pokémon may also adjust other gameplay factors and evolve into more powerful stages. Players may use Trainer cards to draw cards into their hand, harm their opponent, or perform other gameplay functions. Card effects often rely on elements of luck, such as dice rolls and coin tosses, to decide an outcome. Gameplay relies on the usage of counters to indicate damage dealt and status effects.

The &quot;Pokémon TCG&quot; has been the subject of both officially-sanctioned and informal tournaments. Wizards of the Coast staged multiple tournaments across American malls and stores. Official tournaments are currently overseen by Play! Pokémon, a division of The Pokémon Company, and are hosted on a local, national, and international basis By Gopu. In addition, numerous video game adaptations of the &quot;Pokémon TCG&quot; have been published, including &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; (Game Boy Color), the &quot;Pokémon: Play It!&quot; series (PC), &quot;Pokémon TCG Online&quot; (PC). After the closure of TCG Online in 2023, it was replaced with &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game Live&quot; (PC) and &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket&quot; (mobile) in 2024.

As of March 2024, the game has produced over 64.8 billion cards worldwide. Beside formal competitions and informal battling, the &quot;Pokémon TCG&quot; has also been the subject of collecting hobbies, with an extensive market for individual Pokémon cards, packs, and ephemera. 

==Development and publication==
The &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; was developed in Japan, based on the 1996 &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot; Game Boy video game by Nintendo. It was first published in October 1996 by Media Factory in Japan. In the US, it was first published by Wizards of the Coast, towards the end of 1998 to capitalize on the US popularity of &quot;Pokémon&quot;. Over the next five years, Wizards of the Coast published more than a dozen expansion sets for the game, allowing the company to sell millions of cards and earn more revenue from Pokémon than they had from &quot;&quot; in its first 10 years. Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in September 1999 for $325 million dollars based on the strength of the Pokémon license. In 2001, Nintendo created its affiliate Pokémon USA, Inc., so that it could recover the US licensing rights to the game. In June 2003, Nintendo transferred the publishing rights from Wizards of the Coast to The Pokémon Company. Wizards sued Nintendo on October 1, 2003, and accused the company of poaching employees and violating its patent; the lawsuit was settled out of court.

==Gameplay==

The &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; is a strategy-based card game that is usually played on a designated playmat or digitally on an official game client where two players (assuming the role of Pokémon Trainer) use their Pokémon to battle one another. Pokémon that have sustained enough damage from attacks–that reaches or exceeds its HP–is referred to as being &quot;Knocked Out&quot;, granting the opponent a prize card; however, powerful card mechanics like Pokémon-V and Pokémon ex grant extra prize cards when Knocked Out.

Taking all six prize cards is the most common win condition. Other ways to win are by &quot;Knocking Out&quot; or by removing all opponent&#x27;s Pokémon in play–the Active and those on the Bench (i.e. the row behind the Active that can house up to five additional Pokémon to support and substitute Active Pokémon if it retreats or is &quot;Knocked Out&quot;), or by Decked Out–if at the opponent&#x27;s next turn they have no cards left in deck to draw into.

Players begin by having one player select heads or tails, and the other flips a coin; the winner of the coin flip will decide who goes first or second. (Dice may be used in place of coins, with even numbers representing heads and odd numbers representing tails; dice are also primarily used in official tournaments organized by The Pokémon Company). The player going first cannot attack or play a Supporter card (powerful Trainer effects card) on their first turn. Players shuffle their decks and draw seven cards, and then each puts one Basic Pokémon in play as their Active Pokémon. This Pokémon is the one that is actively attacking and receiving damage. If a player does not have any Basic Pokémon, they must call mulligan, shuffle, and then draw another hand until they draw a Basic Pokémon; the opponent may draw one additional card per mulligan. Once both players have at least one Basic Pokémon, they can play up to five more Basic Pokémon onto their Bench, and then take the top six cards of their deck and place them to the side as Prize cards.

Play alternates between players who may take several actions during their turn, including playing additional Basic Pokémon, evolving their Pokémon, attaching an Energy card, playing Trainer cards, and using Pokémon abilities and attacks. After Trainer cards are played, cards are discarded by effects from Trainer cards or Abilities, and after Pokémon were &quot;Knocked Out&quot;, they are put into the discard pile. A player may also retreat their Active Pokémon, switching the Active Pokémon with one on the Bench by paying the Active Pokémon&#x27;s retreat cost of a certain number of Energies. At the cost of ending the turn, players may use one of their Active Pokémon&#x27;s attacks once the prerequisite number and types of Energy attached to that Pokémon is fulfilled. Effects from that attack are then activated and damage may be dealt on the defending Pokémon, which may modify based on the defender Pokémon&#x27;s type weakness or a resistance policies, and/or by any other effects on the defending Pokémon. Players alternate attacking until a player wins either through one of the above win conditions or by concession.

=== Card types ===
Pokémon cards depict one or multiple Pokémon from the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, one to two elemental types, one or more attacks and/or an Ability, and a certain amount of HP. Basic Pokémon are Pokémon that have not evolved and can be played directly onto the Bench; they have Stage 1, Stage 2, and/or special mechanic evolutions. Each player may have up to six Pokémon in play: one in the Active Spot and five on the Bench.

Most Pokémon have attacks that require a certain amount of Energies to use. Attacks deal damage to the opponent&#x27;s Active Pokémon and sometimes deal additional damage to their Benched Pokémon; they may have additional effects like drawing cards, inflicting Special Conditions (Asleep, Burned, Confused, Paralyzed, or Poisoned) or altering the opponent&#x27;s deck and/or board state. Abilities, previously called Poké-Powers and Poké-Bodies until 2011, are not attacks, but special effects on Pokémon that may be activated once or multiple times during their turn, such as drawing additional cards or switching the opponent&#x27;s Active Pokémon with one of their Benched Pokémon, or can be passive, i.e. they remain in effect as long as the Pokémon with the Ability remains in play.

The other type of Pokémon cards are Evolution Pokémon. In contrast to a Basic Pokémon, Evolution Pokémon cannot be directly put into play; they must be placed on top of the corresponding previous Stage Pokémon to evolve it, and they cannot be played onto a Pokémon the same turn that Pokémon was put into the Bench or during the player&#x27;s first turn. Stage 1 Pokémon evolve from Basic Pokémon, and Stage 2 Pokémon evolve from Stage 1 Pokémon. As a Pokémon evolves, it gains HP and their attacks change, usually becoming more powerful. Over the years many different variations to the standard mechanics have been added, the most prominent of which are the signature feature of their respective expansion series. 

Other Pokémon attributes include Owner&#x27;s Pokémon, Baby Pokémon, Crystal Pokémon, Dark Pokémon, Light Pokémon, Team Magma&#x27;s cards, Team Aqua&#x27;s cards, δ Delta Species, Pokémon Prime, Pokémon SP, Restored Pokémon, Team Plasma cards, Ancient Trait, Ultra Beasts, Single Strike, Rapid Strike, Fusion Strike, Ancient, and Future cards.

Trainer cards perform various effects to affect the game, including but not limited to: drawing cards, healing Pokémon, discarding Energy from opposing Pokémon, or retrieving cards from the discard pile. Before the &quot;Diamond &amp; Pearl&quot; series, all cards that were not Pokémon or Energy were considered Trainer cards. Afterward, Trainer cards were subdivided into three categories, Item, Stadium, and Supporter. Item cards directly affect the battling Pokémon and include the subcategory Pokémon Tool cards to attach to a Pokémon and provide for different effects. Stadium cards provide global effects both players can use, usually once per turn. Supporter cards have considerably the strongest effects, but they are limited to one per turn. Starting with &quot;Scarlet &amp; Violet&quot;, Pokémon Tool cards are considered as a separate category from Item cards; existing Pokémon Tool cards have received errata to conform to this change. ACE SPEC Trainer cards have powerful unique effects but only one ACE SPEC card is allowed in the deck.

Energy cards are attached to Pokémon in play to power their attacks. Only one Energy card may be attached per turn, unless a player has an effect that specifies otherwise. There are two categories of Energy cards: Basic Energy and Special Energy. The nine different Basic Energy types which correspond to Pokémon card types are Grass, Fire, Water, Lightning, Psychic, Fighting, Darkness, Metal, and Fairy. The Dragon type does not have a corresponding Basic Energy card, and instead uses multiple types of Energy cards. Basic Energy cards fulfill costs for attacking and retreating and don&#x27;t have additional effects, while most Special Energy cards have additional effects. Most attacks require a certain type and amount of Energy. If the attack has a Colorless Energy requirement, that requirement can be met by any Energy card. Any amount of Basic Energy can be put in the deck, but only four of each special energy can be put in, just like Trainer and Pokémon cards.

===Pokémon types===
Pokémon Types are elemental attributes, determining the strengths and weaknesses for each Pokémon and its attacks. Pokémon take double damage from attacks of types they are weak to and less damage from attacks they resist. These type matchups offset one another in rock–paper–scissors-style relationships. Pokémon Types in the TCG include Fire, Fighting, Dragon, Lightning, Grass, Water, Fairy, Psychic, Darkness, Metal, and Colorless. Other Pokémon types such as Ice and Ground types from the franchise, however, do not have their own types in the TCG and instead are categorized/incorporated inside other types; for example, Ice type and Ground type are categorized under Water type and Fighting type, respectively.

Starting with &quot;Dragons Exalted&quot;, Dragon type Pokémon are now listed as Dragon-type, and they were previously categorized under the Colorless type. Similarly, starting with &quot;Sword &amp; Shield&quot;, Poison type Pokémon are categorized under Darkness-type; Poison-type were previously Psychic type, and before that they were categorized under Grass type.

A simplified type system was adopted from the video games for use in the trading card game. Darkness and Metal types was introduced alongside the corresponding &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; video game, the Dragon-type was introduced in the Japanese &quot;Dragon Selection&quot; set; and Fairy type was introduced in the &quot;XY&quot; set to correspond to its introduction in the franchise, but they were later categorized under Psychic type starting with &quot;Sword and Pokémon Shield&quot;. While most Pokémon have only one type, three exceptions are &quot;EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua&quot; which introduced dual-type Pokémon that have two different types, as well as &quot;XY&quot; and &quot;HeartGold and SoulSilver&quot; series sets. Dual types were also utilized in Pokémon-Legend cards from &quot;HeartGold and SoulSilver&quot;. In August 2016, &quot;XY&quot; &quot;Steam Siege&quot; reintroduced the dual-type mechanic, but this time on regular Pokémon and Pokémon-EX.

==Sets==
The &quot;Pokémon TCG&quot; debuted In Japan in 1996 with the release of &quot;1st Starter &amp; Expansion Pack/Base Set&quot; (第1弾スターターパック &amp; 第1弾拡張パック), which was the original core series of cards and Theme Decks released in Japan on October 20, 1996, and in the United States on January 9, 1999. The &quot;1st Starter &amp; Expansion Pack&quot; contained various Pokémon cards depicting the original 150 Pokémon species in the main Pokémon franchise, and it is the only expansion not to have a set logo or symbol (i.e. except for the error &quot;no-symbol&quot; &quot;Jungle&quot; cards).

In the United States, the &quot;1998 Pokémon Demo Game Plastic Pack&quot; was the earliest introduction to the &quot;Pokémon TCG&quot;, preceding the &quot;1st Starter &amp; Expansion Pack&quot;; and consisting of 24 Base Set shadowless cards and an instruction manual. &quot;The Pokémon Demo Game Plastic Pack&quot;, &quot;Base Set&quot;, along with the subsequent expansions &quot;Jungle&quot;, &quot;Fossil&quot;, &quot;Base Set 2&quot;, &quot;Team Rocket&quot;, &quot;Gym Heroes&quot;, &quot;Gym Challenge&quot;, make up the &quot;First Generation Sets&quot; published by the original English-edition publisher Wizards of the Coasts. Similarly, the &quot;Second Generation Sets&quot; published by Wizards comprised &quot;Neo Genesis&quot;, &quot;Neo Discovery&quot;, &quot;Southern Islands&quot;, &quot;Neo Revelation&quot;, &quot;Neo Destiny&quot;, &quot;Legendary Collection&quot;, &quot;Expedition Base Set&quot;, &quot;Aquapolis&quot;, and &quot;Skyridge&quot;. The &quot;Second Generation Sets&quot; is the last collection set published by Wizards before Nintendo transferred the publishing right to The Pokémon Company In July 2003. Since July 2003, The Pokémon Company has published eight additional &quot;Generation&quot; sets, which has gradually transitioned the TCG to more modern gameplay and mechanics.

== Card collecting ==

Pokémon cards are sold at stores in many different formats including pre-constructed decks, booster-packs-bundled promo cards set, booster box of 36 packs, or individual packs. Subsequently, cards are also available through e-commerce websites and individual sellers. However, buyers should be cautioned of fake Pokémon cards.

Pokémon card collectables are valued based on their rarity, though some lower rarity cards can be worth more than higher rarity ones. This depends on the popularity of the card within competitive play, the age of the card, number of cards printed, and various other factors. From the lowest to the highest level, cards rarities are indicated by different shapes on the bottom corner, i.e. &quot;Common&quot; (circle), &quot;Uncommon&quot; (diamond), and &quot;Rare&quot; (star). Japanese-edition cards use letters rather than shapes to denote rarities; i.e. from the lowest to the highest level, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;RR&quot;, &quot;SR&quot;, and &quot;UR&quot;. In a single &quot;Pokémon TCG&quot; booster pack, a collector can pull 10 cards in total, i.e. five Common cards, three Uncommon cards, a reverse holographic card of any rarity, and sometimes a Rare card. Starting with the &quot;Scarlet and Violet&quot; series however, each pack will contain one holographic card, as well as two reverse holographic cards. Unlike the basic &quot;Common and Uncommon, Rare&quot; collectables are divided into many different sub-groups, comprising Holo Rare, Reverse Holo, Half Art/Half Body, Full Art/Full Body, Secret Rare, Ultra Rare, Rainbow Rare, Promo, and card mechanics including EX/GX, V/VSTAR/VMAX, and Tag Team. Rarities can be also account for old card collectibles such as &quot;1st-edition Base Set&quot; and &quot;First Generation Sets&quot;, and such collectibles are some of the rarest and most expensive Pokémon cards with some valuing at thousands and millions of dollars.

Holo Rare are Rare cards that have a holographic illustration, whereas Reverse Holo are any-rarity cards that have holographic textures elsewhere on the surface except for the main illustration. Half Art and Full Art are Half Body and Full Body artworks covering the entire/half the card surface, respectively. In comparison, Secret Rares can be Full Art or Half Arts but with additional artwork schemes such as alternative holofoil scheme, shiny scheme, or a gold trim; they are characterized by a set number past the actual printed size of the set (ex. 242/220). Secret Rares also comprise the subset Rainbow Rare, which features similar materials but in rainbow-color foil schemes. In response to these collectible&#x27;s considerable rarities, card collectors use card sleeves to protect them from wear and tear.

From least to most, the top 15 most rare and expensive Pokémon cards are &quot;20th Anniversary 24-karat real-gold Pikachu&quot;, &quot;Prerelease Raichu&quot;, &quot;Master&#x27;s Key&quot;, &quot;Espeon and Umbreon Gold Star POP Series 5&quot;, &quot;2002 Pokémon World Championships No. 1 Trainer&quot;, &quot;1996 Pokémon Japanese Base Set No Rarity Symbol Holo Venusaur&quot;, &quot;1999 Pokémon Japanese Promo Tropical Mega Battle Tropical Wind&quot;, &quot;1999 Super Secret Battle No. 1 Trainer, &quot;2006 Pokémon World Championships Promo No. 2 Trainer&quot;, &quot;2000 Pokémon Neo Genesis 1st Edition Holo Lugia #9&quot;, &quot;Kangaskhan-Holo #115 Family Event Trophy Card&quot;, &quot;Black Star Ishihara Signed GX Promo Card&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Blastoise #009/165R Commissioned Presentation Galaxy Star Hologram&quot;, &quot;1999 First Edition Shadowless Holographic Charizard #4&quot;, and a PSA-graded 10 &quot;Pikachu Illustrator&quot;.

The &quot;Pikachu Illustrator&quot; is the rarest and most expensive Pokémon card ever sold in history, and it was acquired by the celebrity and collector Logan Paul for $5,275,000 in July 2021. Created as a prize for the 1997-1998 Pokémon design contests organized by the Japanese manga-magazine CoroCoro Comic and with only 41 copies printed, it is the only Pokémon card to say &quot;Illustrator&quot; instead of &quot;Trainer&quot; like other Trainer cards. The card was illustrated by Atsuko Nishida, the original designer of the Pokémon species including Pikachu. The Japanese imprint reads: &quot;We certify that your illustration is an excellent entry in the Pokémon Card Game Illust Contest. Therefore, we state that you are an Officially Authorized Pokémon Card Illustrator and admire your skill.&quot;
While the Pikachu Illustrator Card purchased by Logan Paul has the record for the most expensive Pokémon Card ever sold, other lower grade versions of the card have been sold for high prices elsewhere. Shopping platform ZenPlus, a subsidiary of shopping service ZenMarket (now part of ZenGroup), sold two of the cards in 2020, for the Japanese Yen equivalent of US$233,000 and US$208,496 respectively. A third card was sold on the platform in 2022 for US$772,000.

There are various TikTok accounts dedicated to opening Pokémon card packs (also known as &quot;ripping&quot; packs) people buy live on stream for viewers. Some streamers even run &quot;pulls&quot;, where certain cards or number values are associated with rare, high value cards that are included if they happen to be pulled during pack openings. While there are genuine accounts associated with this trend, there are also scammers intentionally selling resealed packs with valuable cards already taken out, sending counterfeit cards or not sending anything at all. Pack rips are also streamed for other popular card games such as and One Piece.

==Competitive play==

In addition to the collectible aspect of the card game, The Pokémon Company International (formerly known as Pokémon USA) has also organized Play! Pokémon, a program run by Pokémon Organized Play (POP), players can compete against others in tournaments and earn player points, two-card booster packets for promotional sets, badges, stickers and other prizes. POP are governed by League Leaders and League Owners. Play! Pokémon also features a professor program, where individuals aged 18 or over may be nominated as a &quot;professor&quot;, who can help sanction the tournament.

League Leaders assist in organizing the league, while League Owners are the main organizer of the event. The latter report directly to the Organized Play program every seven weeks. A league cycle is usually divided into eight seasons, each of which lasts about five weeks and is typically represented by themes found in Pokémon (e.g. gym badges, starter Pokémon). Play! Pokémon supports both standard and expanded card format, however in its competitive tournaments only standard format (i.e. card rotation format that discontinues older Pokémon cards to foster new strategies and a healthy competitive environment) are permitted. In contrast to the former, expanded card format permits inclusion of any Pokémon cards, regardless if they are older cards.

The first &quot;Pokémon TCG&quot; tournament began on June 14–15, 1997, at the Makuhari Messe Event Hall. As the tournament had no real skill-based qualifiers, participants were admitted through preregistration and through an extensive lottery system process if too many people applied. Many deck lists including the winning deck lists used in the tournament are poorly built because of the lack of skill sets in the admittance process, with many players running incomplete evolution lines and excessive Trainer cards. The tournament was divided into four sessions with three solely restricted to elementary school players and one allowing players up to junior high. The top three player of the tournament were awarded the No.1, 2, and 3 trainer trophy cards; this practice continue through subsequent &quot;Pokémon TCG&quot; tournaments and organized plays.

Players in a tournament are split into three age categories: Junior (11 years old and younger), Senior (12 to 15 years old), and Master (16 years old and older). Notable references include Austin Brewen who won the first junior tournament, Brenden Zhang who won the first Senior Tournament, and Arturo Heras who won the first Master Tournament. These tournaments play several rounds, where players will play a standard game against each other and wins and losses will be recorded. In most tournaments, there are some Swiss-style rounds where players are paired up against others of similar win/loss ratios, usually from their age group (this does not always occur in smaller events, though). Afterward, there will be a cut off the top record-holders (approximately the top 1/8 of participants) where players will play best two out of three matches and the loser gets eliminated (standard tournament bracket style), with an eventual winner.

POP runs a season for these tournaments, which allows players to earn larger prizes and play in a more competitive environment in comparison to League. These range from City and Regional Championships, all the way up to the Pokémon World Championships, the single invite-only event of the year. Players can earn invites to the World Championships by winning or ranking high at International Championships, doing well at tournaments to get Championship Points, or by qualifying in the Last Chance Qualifier. Some of these methods are only used in the United States, as PUI and POP are based in the United States, but they are represented by local distributors who provide the Organized Play program to their own country.

Although The Pokémon Company International tries to keep Organized Play as uniform as possible globally, there are some notable differences in how POP is run outside of the United States. The Pokémon Card Laboratory (PCL), located in Japan, is the designer of new cards and the ultimate authority on any matter relating to the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;. It can declare rulings on any in-game circumstance, issue errata, change card text after publishing, and change the basic game rules, although the latter three rarely occur. PCL runs Organized Play in Japan. The &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; in most European countries is currently handled by The Pokémon Company International. Certain countries have no direct official presence; in these regions, distributors of the game run tournaments. European countries can qualify for positions at the Pokémon Trading Card Game World Championships each year, through National Championships and European Rankings.

===&quot;Pokémon TCG&quot; World Championships===
The first &quot;Pokémon TCG&quot; World Championships was held in 2004 at Orlando, Florida, U.S. The venue was organized by Wizards of Coasts, with more than 100 invited contestants from various countries. To qualify for the championships, players are required to collect Championship Points across regionals and other official tournaments, which can vary based on each championship and different regions.
== Controversies ==

In November 2000, Israeli magician Uri Geller alleged that Kadabra&#x27;s spoon bending and Japanese name, Yungera, were unauthorized appropriations of his identity, leading him to sue Nintendo. Geller learned of the similarity after fans of both himself and Pokémon noted the similarities between him and Kadabra, He remarked that the lightning patterns on its abdomen is popular with the Waffen-SS and that Nintendo had &quot;turned [Geller] into an evil, occult Pokémon character&quot;. A Nintendo director denied this, stating that they had no knowledge of any Pokémon named &quot;based on the image of any particular person&quot;. In 2008, Pokémon anime director and storyboard artist Masamitsu Hidaka stated that Kadabra would not be used in the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; until an agreement was reached on the case. In November 2020, Geller told &quot;TheGamer&quot; that he received emails from Pokémon fans which convinced him to drop the case and allow Nintendo to bring back Kadabra.

In March 2023, a player was disqualified from a regional tournament for allegedly laughing when they were asked by a game official for their pronouns. This generated backlash from the community and a fundraiser was created to help cover the teenager&#x27;s travel and lodging costs. The fundraiser, as of March 30, had raised over $3,000.

==Reception==
The reviewer from the online second volume of &quot;Pyramid&quot; in 1999 stated that &quot;&quot;Pokémon&quot; is the second most popular CCG in Japan (behind &quot;&quot;), and it&#x27;s no fluke. The game plays like a kinder, gentler version of &quot;Magic&quot;, with easier rules and graphics geared to the younger crowd.&quot; In the United States, Wizards of the Coast reported in early 1999 that it had sold 400,000 packs of &quot;Pokémon&quot; trading cards in less than six weeks of its release.

In 2016, it was the year&#x27;s top-selling toy in the strategic card game subclass. In 2017, it had an 82% share of Europe&#x27;s strategic card game market. As of March 2023, the game has sold over 52.9 billion cards worldwide.

==Video games==
The &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; video game adaptation was developed by Hudson Soft and Creatures and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color console. It was released in Japan in December 1998 and later in North American and Europe in 2000, reappearing in the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console released in 2014. The adaptation are similar in gameplay and rules, featuring 226 cards from the TCG with infrared linking for multiplayer and trading. The video game was accompanied by &quot;Pokémon Card GB2: Great Rocket-Dan Sanjō!&quot;, a Japan-exclusive sequel released in March 2001. In addition to the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; video game, Wizards has developed another digitized adaptation, &quot;Pokémon Play It!&quot;, which consisted of two versions that offer players a beginner&#x27;s introduction to the different gameplay aspects of TCG as they slowly transitioned into &quot;Advanced Challenges&quot; in the 2nd version. The first version of &quot;Pokémon Play It!&quot; was released in 1999, followed by its sequel &quot;Pokémon Play It! Version 2&quot; in 2000.

The &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game Online&quot; was a prominent video game adaptation of the &quot;Pokémon TCG.&quot; It was released on March 24, 2011, as &quot;Pokémon Trainer Challenge&quot; for Microsoft Windows, Android, macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. The game initially offered three starting decks but significantly expanded its card collection shortly after release. Card packs and premade decks could be redeemed using in-game currencies and rewards. Beginning April 6, 2011, players could redeem digital booster packs using a promo code card bundled inside printed booster packs.

<text>John Fitzalan, 6th Earl of Arundel, 3rd Baron Maltravers (1 August 138521 April 1421) was an English nobleman.

==Origins==
He was the son of John Fitzalan, 2nd Baron Arundel (1364-1390), by his wife Elizabeth le Despenser, daughter of Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer.

==Career==
He became 3rd Baron Arundel on his father&#x27;s death in 1390 and Baron Maltravers on his grandmother&#x27;s death in 1405. He was with the army in Scotland in 1383 and with the English Fleet on the western coast of France.

==Heir to Earldom of Arundel==
In 1415, his father&#x27;s cousin Thomas Fitzalan, 5th Earl of Arundel died, leaving John Fitzalan as his closest male heir. The Earldom of Arundel had been entailed to heirs male, and so the next year John Fitzalan was summoned to Parliament as Earl of Arundel. However, the inheritance, insofar as it related to the property of the prior earl rather than the title and Arundel Castle, was challenged and disputed between Arundel and the previous earl&#x27;s sisters. The dispute was not settled during their lifetimes, and John Fitzalan was subsequently summoned to Parliament as Baron Maltravers, not as Earl of Arundel.

==Marriage and progeny==

He married Eleanor Berkeley (died 1 August 1455), a daughter of Sir John Berkeley (1352–1428) of Beverstone Castle in Gloucestershire by his wife Elizabeth Betteshorne. She survived him and remarried twice, firstly to Sir Richard Poynings (died 10 June 1429), of Poynings in Sussex, by whom she had a daughter Eleanor Poynings (c. 14221484), &quot;suo jure&quot; Baroness Poynings, wife of Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, (1421–1461); and secondly to Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford (died 9 August 1449). By his wife, John had two sons:
* John Fitzalan, 7th Earl of Arundel, who eventually succeeded in his claim to the earldom.
* William Fitzalan, 9th Earl of Arundel, who married Joan Neville, a daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury.

==Plot==
In Chicago, 30-year-old Fotoula &quot;Toula&quot; Portokalos is a member of a large, loud, overbearing Greek family. Her father, Gus, wants her to get married and have children as soon as possible. Toula lives with her parents and works in her family&#x27;s restaurant, &quot;Dancing Zorba&#x27;s&quot;, but longs to gain independence from her family. 

One day, a teacher named Ian Miller meets a friend at Dancing Zorba&#x27;s, and Toula develops a crush on him. That evening, Toula tells her parents that she wants to take a class at the local college to learn about computers to help them run the restaurant, but Gus becomes emotional, believing Toula intends to leave him. Toula&#x27;s mother, Maria, comforts her and convinces Gus to agree to Toula&#x27;s idea.

As the weeks pass, Toula gains more confidence and changes her image, switching her thick-framed glasses for contact lenses, styling her hair, and wearing makeup and brighter clothes that show her figure. After seeing a flyer for a class about computers and tourism, Toula suggests to her aunt Voula that she could take the class and apply what she learns to help Voula&#x27;s travel agency. Voula agrees, and she and Maria covertly convince Gus to agree as well.

While Toula is working in the travel agency, Ian notices her and asks her out for dinner. On their date, Toula confesses to Ian that her family owns Dancing Zorba&#x27;s; he suddenly remembers her and, contrary to Toula&#x27;s fear that he would remember her as &quot;frump girl&quot;, he remains interested in her. They continue dating and fall in love.

Knowing her family would disapprove of her dating a non-Greek, Toula lies about taking a pottery class as a cover to continue seeing Ian. However, Toula&#x27;s lie is exposed when a family friend sees them kissing in a parking lot. Gus is furious that Ian did not ask his permission to date Toula, even though they are grown adults and forbids them from seeing each other. Despite Gus&#x27;s efforts at introducing Toula to single Greek men, they keep dating. Toula&#x27;s brother, Niko, tells her that she inspired him to follow his passion and take art courses at night. 

Ian proposes marriage and Toula accepts. Maria tells Gus that he must respect Toula&#x27;s decision, but he remains upset because Ian is not a member of the Greek Orthodox Church. Ian agrees to be baptized into the church to persuade Toula&#x27;s family to accept him. 

Toula&#x27;s family members constantly insert themselves into the wedding planning, designing ugly bridesmaid dresses and misspelling Ian&#x27;s mother&#x27;s name on the wedding invitations. Ian&#x27;s quiet, conservative parents meet Toula&#x27;s entire family during a loud and extravagant Greek family dinner. When Toula&#x27;s relatives get them drunk on ouzo, Gus becomes frustrated, saying they looked at the family like they were animals at the zoo. Toula worries about whether her father has accepted Ian, but Maria reassures her that she and Gus came to the United States so Toula and her siblings could have the freedom she didn&#x27;t have as a child. 

At the wedding reception, Gus gives a heartfelt speech focusing on how the differences in the newlyweds&#x27; backgrounds do not matter. He and Maria reveal that they have bought a house for Toula and Ian. As the two families dance together, Toula narrates that while her family is loud and unconventional, she knows they love her and will always be there for her. 

Six years later, Toula and Ian leave their house, located next door to Gus and Maria&#x27;s house, to walk their daughter, Paris, to Greek school.

==Production==

===Development===
&quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; started as a one-woman 45-minute monologue workshop, written by, and starring Vardalos, first developed in the HBO Workshop, then tested in Chicago, Toronto and Europe, later performed at the Hudson Backstage&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/backstage-theatre&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre in Los Angeles in August&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/2003-01-26-ca-artsnotes26.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 1997. moving to ACME Comedy Theatre, still as a workshop. 

The one-woman 45-minute monologue workshop was based on Vardalos&#x27;s own family in Winnipeg in Canada and on her experience marrying a non-Greek man (actor Ian Gomez). The one-woman 45-minute monologue workshop was popular and was sold out for much of its run, in part due to Vardalos&#x27;s marketing it across Greek Orthodox churches in the area. Several Hollywood executives and celebrities saw it, including actress Rita Wilson, who is herself of Greek origin; Wilson convinced her husband, actor Tom Hanks, to see it as well.

Vardalos began meeting various executives about making a film version of the monologue and began writing a screenplay as well. However, the meetings proved fruitless because the executives insisted on making changes that they felt would make the film more marketable, to which Vardalos objected. These included changing the plot, getting a known actress in the lead role (Marisa Tomei was one name mentioned), and changing the family&#x27;s ethnicity to Hispanic. Two months after the monologue&#x27;s initial run ended, Hanks&#x27;s production company, Playtone, contacted Vardalos about producing a film based on her vision for it; they also agreed to remount it, as a one-woman play, in January 1998, at the Globe Playhouse,&lt;ref name=&quot;wehoonline/globe-playhouse&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; West Hollywood, for a three-night-a-week run. 

In 2000, while in Toronto doing pre-production for the film, Vardalos and Playtone producer Gary Goetzman overheard actor John Corbett (who was in town shooting the film &quot;Serendipity&quot;) at a bar, telling a friend of his about having read the script for &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;, and being upset that he couldn&#x27;t make the auditions. Vardalos and Goetzman approached Corbett and offered him the part of Ian Miller on the spot, which he accepted.

Hanks later said that casting Vardalos in the lead role &quot;brings a huge amount of integrity to the piece because it&#x27;s Nia&#x27;s version of her own life and her own experience. I think that shows through on the screen and people recognize it.&quot;

===Filming===

Despite being based on life in the Greek community of Winnipeg, the film was set in Chicago and shot in both Toronto and Chicago. Toronto Metropolitan University and the Greektown neighborhood are featured prominently in the film. The home used to depict Gus and Maria Portokalos&#x27;s residence (as well as the home bought next door at the end of the film for Toula and Ian) is located on Glenwood Crescent just off O&#x27;Connor Drive in the Toronto suburb of East York. The real home representing the Portokalos&#x27; residence has most of the external ornamentation that was shown in the film. Also, some minor parts of the movie were shot at Jarvis Collegiate Institute in Toronto.

Principal photography began on May 9, 2001, and ended on June 30, 2001.

==Release==
After a February 2002 premiere, it was initially released in the United States via a limited release on April 19, 2002, before receiving a wider release worldwide over the summer, including a wide release in the United States on August 2.
==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; became a sleeper hit and grew steadily from its limited release. Despite never hitting the number one spot for a box office weekend and being an independent film with a $5 million budget, it ultimately grossed over $368.7 million worldwide, becoming one of the top romantic films of the 21st century. It was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2002 in the United States and Canada, with USD$241,438,208, and the highest-grossing romantic comedy domestically in history. Domestically, it also held the record for the highest-grossing film never having been number one on the weekly North American box office charts until the 2016 release of the animated film &quot;Sing&quot;. However, adjusted for inflation, the gross of &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; was still higher, equivalent to $ million in 2016. The film is among the most profitable of all time, with a 6150% return on an (also inflation-adjusted) cost of $6 million to produce.

As of December 2003, the video sold 9,85 million copies earning a profit of over 164.8 million dollars.

===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Accolades===
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:
** Nominated Romantic Comedy Film

===10th-anniversary edition===
In 2012, a 10th anniversary edition of the film was released via DVD and Blu-ray by HBO. The edition contains a digital copy of the film and features deleted scenes as well as a 30-minute retrospective with Vardalos and Corbett.

==Lawsuits==
The cast (with the exception of Vardalos, who had a separate deal), as well as Hanks&#x27; production company, Playtone, sued the studio in 2007 for their part of the profits they were owed. They charged that Gold Circle Films was engaging in so-called &quot;Hollywood accounting&quot; practices where it reported only $287 million in aggregate gross receipts, including box office earnings, television broadcast rights and video sales rentals, despite grossing $370 million in box office alone. This followed another lawsuit in 2003 where the original producers of the film MPH Entertainment Inc. sued the production company Playtone and Gold Circle Films where one of the defendants claimed that the film lost $20 million despite a reported gross of $600 million from all revenue streams.

==Legacy==

===Television series===

The film inspired the brief 2003 TV series &quot;My Big Fat Greek Life&quot;, with most of the major characters played by the same actors, with the exception of Steven Eckholdt replacing Corbett as the husband. Corbett had already signed on to the TV series &quot;Lucky&quot;. He was scheduled to appear as the best friend of his replacement&#x27;s character, but the show was cancelled before he appeared. The show received poor reviews from critics noting the random character entrances and serious plot &quot;adjustments&quot; that did not match the film.

The seven episodes from the series are available on DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, whose TV studio division produced the show.

===Sequels===
====&quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2&quot; (2016)====

In a 2009 interview for her film &quot;My Life in Ruins&quot;, asked about a possible sequel for &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;, Vardalos said that she had an idea for a sequel and had started writing it, hinting that, like &quot;Ruins&quot;, the film would be set in Greece.

Asked about a sequel again in a November 2012 interview, she said:
On May 27, 2014, various news and media outlets reported that a sequel was in the works. Nia Vardalos later confirmed this via Twitter, and she also has written a script for the film. The first trailer for &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2&quot; was aired on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot; on November 11, 2015 and it was released on March 25, 2016, to negative critical reception and modest box office success.

====&quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3&quot; (2023) ====

In late June 2016, Vardalos said that she had not written a third film, but was open to the possibility. On April 8, 2021, it was announced that &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3&quot; was in development as an independent film written by Vardalos, who would also reprise her role as Toula. The project was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as production could not begin until the studio was able to obtain insurance for its crew. In October 2021, Vardalos confirmed that the script for the third film had been completed.

On May 15, 2022, it was announced that filming would take place throughout Greece that summer, with large portions being shot on Corfu from July 5 to August 3. On June 22, Vardalos was announced as the film&#x27;s director. Principal photography commenced on June 22, 2022, in Athens and wrapped on August 10, 2022.

The film is a joint production of Playtone, Gold Circle Films, HBO Films, and Focus Features and was released on September 8, 2023. The film was dedicated to the memory of Michael Constantine, who died on August 31, 2021, at the age of 94. The film&#x27;s plot follows the Portokalos family on a trip to Greece for a family reunion following the death of Toula&#x27;s father Gus.

<text>Mepkin Abbey is a Trappist monastery in Berkeley County, South Carolina. The abbey is located near Moncks Corner, at the junction of the two forks of the Cooper River northwest of Charleston, and is located in the Diocese of Charleston.

==History==
The area has been known as Mepkin for centuries, and was originally the estate of several historic families. The first record of the name was a 1681 grant to the sons of Sir John Coleton, one of the Lords Proprietary of South Carolina. In 1762 one of his descendants sold the land to Henry Laurens of Charleston. Laurens built his home there, and it was known as the Mepkin Plantation. 

After a few generations, the Laurens family sold the property, and it passed through several hands. In 1936 the well-known publisher Henry R. Luce bought the property. The plantation, which was created from several smaller plantations, contained over 7200 acres when Luce bought the property for a reported $150,000. When the Luces bought the plantation, Laurnes&#x27; house was already gone; the then-current house had been built in 1906. New York architect Edward Durell Stone traveled to Mepkin in 1936 to design a new house for the Luces. His wife, Clare Boothe Luce, commissioned and built an extensive landscape garden there known as the Mepkin Garden. In 1949 the Luces donated a large part of the property, including the garden, to the Trappist Order&#x27;s Gethsemani Abbey.

Twenty-nine monks of the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance (Trappists) came from Gethsemani, Kentucky, to found the new Mepkin Abbey. With a few limitations, the Abbey and the Mepkin Gardens are open to the public on a daily basis. The monastery grounds include a graveyard containing the ashes of Henry Laurens, as well as the graves of John Laurens, Clare Boothe Luce, and Henry Luce. Its gardens are now known as the Mepkin Abbey Botanical Garden.

==Egg farming controversy==

In February 2007, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released video of Mepkin Abbey&#x27;s battery cage egg operation, showing debeaked hens crowded inside battery cages and a monk discussing the practice of forced molting. PETA cited earlier statements by Pope Benedict XVI on factory farming, in which the pontiff criticized the &quot;industrial use of creatures, so that geese are fed in such a way as to produce as large a liver as possible, or hens live so packed together that they become just caricatures of birds&quot; as being incompatible with Biblical teachings on animals. Mepkin Abbey defended itself by citing their compliance with the animal welfare standards of the United Egg Producers. Furthering the controversy, it was discovered shortly after the release of the video that many scenes shown in the video, such as those of dead chickens of the floor, were actually shot at a separate facility rather than at Mepkin Abbey. In December 2007, Mepkin announced on its website that it would phase out the egg production operation which had been its main income, citing the controversy and its disturbance of their monastic way of life. They eventually decided on a mushroom production operation.

<text>USS &quot;Chester&quot; (CS-1/CL-1) of the United States Navy was the first scout cruiser (CS) built for the Navy. In 1920, she was reclassified as a light cruiser (CL). She was launched on 26 June 1907, by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, sponsored by Miss D. W. Sproul, and commissioned on 25 April 1908. She was named in honor of Chester, Pennsylvania. In July 1928, long since decommissioned, her name was changed to USS &quot;York&quot;, in honor of York, Pennsylvania.

==Pre-World War I==

===Up to 1914===
In the period prior to World War I, &quot;Chester&quot; operations included training activities off the East Coast and in the Caribbean, participation in the Fleet Reviews of February 1909, October 1912, and May 1915, and many duties of a diplomatic nature. She carried a Congressional committee on a tour of North Africa in 1909, and the next year, joined in a special South American cruise commemorating the 100th anniversary of the first autonomous government of Buenos Aires, Argentina. As American interests in the Caribbean were threatened by internal political changes in several nations, &quot;Chester&quot; patrolled off Mexico, Santo Domingo, and Haiti, and transported a Marine occupation force in 1911. Later that year, she carried men and stores to the steam patrol yacht , station ship at the then-Austrian port of Trieste, returning to Boston with the American consul at Tripoli.

In April, 1912, &quot;Chester&quot;, and her sister the &quot;Salem&quot; were ordered by the United States Navy to escort the Cunard liner back to New York City, after she had picked up the survivors from the sinking of the .

After a period in reserve from 15 December 1911 – 5 November 1913, &quot;Chester&quot; returned to duty in the Gulf of Mexico guarding American citizens and property during the revolution in Mexico.

===1914===
In early 1914, &quot;Chester&quot; played a significant role in the United States occupation of Veracruz.

:On 2 January 1914, &quot;Chester&quot; was off Gulfport, Mississippi. Aboard her, President Woodrow Wilson held a conference with John Lind, his personal envoy for Mexican affairs. (Note: At that time, there was no U.S. Ambassador to Mexico; President Wilson had appointed Nelson O&#x27;Shaughnessy as &quot;Chargé d&#x27;Affaires ad interim&quot; before Mexican President Victoriano Huerta.)

:On 21 April, just after 08:00 hrs, immediately upon receipt of orders to &quot;seize Custom House&quot; at Veracruz, Admiral Frank F. Fletcher directed Admiral Henry T. Mayo &quot;to send him the scout cruiser &quot;Chester&quot; from Tampico&quot;. Eventually, a fleet of at least seven ships left Tampico for Veracruz that day. Around midnight, on a moonless night, &quot;Chester&quot; was the second ship to arrive at Veracruz (after ).

:Her captain, William A. Moffett, ...
[...] had held the &quot;Chester&quot; at her top speed of twenty-one knots since leaving Tampico, ignoring the protests of her anguished engines. Nearing port, Moffett established radio contact with the &quot;Prairie&quot;. Fletcher warned him that the harbor lights were out, which would make navigating the eighty-six-foot-wide passage between the breakwaters into the inner harbor a hazardous undertaking. When Moffett asked for instructions, however, Fletcher left the matter to his discretion; if he wished, he could wait outside the breakwater until dawn. Moffett chose to run straight in, bringing the &quot;Chester&quot; through the narrow opening in a breath-taking display of seamanship and nerve. He dropped anchor at the Sanitary Warf at 00:05 hrs. From the &quot;Prairie&quot;, Fletcher signaled &quot;Well done&quot;.
:For this action, Moffett was awarded the Medal of Honor.

:On 22 April, around 03:00 hrs, &quot;Chester&quot;″s battalion landed at Pier 4.

:On the morning of 22 April, around 08:30 and 09:00 hrs, the guns of &quot;Chester&quot; were decisive in supporting the successful land attack on the southeastern sector of Veracruz, shelling the Naval Academy and other buildings in the area.

The Chester transported refugees to Cuba, performed various diplomatic missions, and carried mail and stores to the squadron off Veracruz until 19 June 1914.

She returned to Boston for overhaul and another period in reserve, from 12 December 1914 – 4 April 1915.

===After 1914===
Late 1915 and early 1916 found &quot;Chester&quot; in the Mediterranean to aid in relief work in the Middle East, and off the Liberian coast to protect American interests and show American support for the government there threatened by insurrection. &quot;Chester&quot; returned for duty as receiving ship at Boston, where she was out of commission in reserve from 10 May 1916 – 24 March 1917.

==World War I==

When recommissioned, &quot;Chester&quot; operated on protective patrol off the East Coast until 23 August, when she sailed for Gibraltar, and duty escorting convoys on their passage between Gibraltar and Plymouth, England. On 5 September 1918, the cruiser sighted an enemy submarine on her starboard bow. In attempting to ram the enemy, &quot;Chester&quot; passed directly over the submarine as she dived, damaging her own port paravane. Depth charges were hurled at the submarine&#x27;s presumed position, but no further contact was made.

At war&#x27;s end, &quot;Chester&quot; carried several Allied armistice commissions on inspection tours of German ports, then carried troops to the Army units operating in northern Russia. On her homeward bound voyage, on which she cleared Brest, France, on 26 April 1919, she carried Army veterans to New York, which she reached 7 May. 11 days later, she arrived at Boston Navy Yard for overhaul, and was decommissioned there on 10 June 1921. In 1927, she was towed to Philadelphia Navy Yard, and on 10 July 1928, her name was changed to &quot;York&quot;. She was sold for scrap on 13 May 1930.

<doc id="431359" wikidata="Q157238" url="?curid=431359" title="Scilla">
<text>Scilla () is a genus of about 30 to 80 species of bulb-forming perennial herbaceous plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Scilloideae. Sometimes called the squills in English, they are native to woodlands, subalpine meadows, and seashores throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East. A few species are also naturalized in Australasia and North America. Their flowers are usually blue, but white, pink, and purple types are known; most flower in early spring, but a few are autumn-flowering. Several &quot;Scilla&quot; species are valued as ornamental garden plants.

== Taxonomy ==

Species of &quot;Scilla&quot; have been known since classical antiquity, being described by both Greek (Theophrastus (371–287 BC) and Discorides (40–90 AD)) and Roman (Pliny (23–79 AD)) writers. Theophrastus described &quot;Scilla hyacinthoides&quot; (&quot;skilla&quot;), and more briefly &quot;S. autumnalis&quot; and &quot;S. bifolia&quot; in his &quot;Historia plantarum&quot;, where he mentions &quot;those of squill&quot; (σκῐ́λλης; &quot;skilles&quot;). In classical literature, &quot;Scilla&quot; was known for its medicinal properties. Later mentions include pre-Linnaen botanists such as Fuchs (1542) and Clusius (1601), who considered many closely related plants to be types of &quot;Hyacinthus&quot;.

The genus &quot;Scilla&quot; has a long and complicated history in terms of its classification, circumscription and subdivision, and is not fully resolved. The genus &quot;Scilla&quot; was first formally described by Linnaeus in 1753, and hence bears his name as the botanical authority, &quot;Scilla&quot; . In &quot;Scilla&quot;, he included six plants previously considered as &quot;Hyacinthus&quot;. For instance, he renamed Clusius&#x27; &quot;Hyacinthus stellatus cinerei coloris&quot; as &quot;Scilla italica&quot; (&quot;Hyacinthoides italica&quot; in modern systems) and &quot;Hyacinthus stellatus peruanus&quot; as &quot;Scilla peruviana&quot;, while Fuchs&#x27; &quot;Hyacinthus caeruleus mas minor&quot;, he named &quot;Scilla bifolia&quot;. 

In total, Linnaeus listed eight species of &quot;Scilla&quot;, from the Mediterranean, Europe and southwest Asia, and placed the genus in the grouping &quot;Hexandria Monogynia&quot; (6 stamens, 1 pistil) within his system of sexual classification (&quot;systema sexuale&quot;). Since he listed &quot;S. maritima&quot; (which had previously been known as scilla officinale) first, this was considered the type species. On the basis that the seed morphology distinguished this species from all the other Linnean &quot;Scilla&quot;, Steinheil reclassified it as a member of a novel genus, &quot;Urginea&quot;, now submerged in &quot;Drimia&quot; as &quot;Drimia maritima&quot;.

Later, De Jussieu (1789), using a natural system, the relative value of plant characteristics, rather than purely sexual ones, and a hierarchical system of ranks, grouped &quot;Scilla&quot; into a &quot;family&quot; which he called Asphodeli, along with &quot;Hyacinthus&quot; and &quot;Allium&quot;. Jaume-Saint-Hilaire (1805), while maintaining the same affiliation, recognized three species &quot;S. maritima&quot;, &quot;S. amoena&quot; and &quot;S. italica&quot;. By 1853, Lindley had created a very large order, the Liliaceae, in which Scilla and related genera formed one of eleven suborders, as Scilleae. This included many genera, including &quot;Camassia&quot; and &quot;Ornithogalum&quot;. Treatments of Scilla in the nineteenth century include those of Dumortier (1827), Salisbury (1796, 1866) and Baker (1873), with rather different approaches.

Historically, &quot;Scilla&quot; and related genera were placed with lily-like plants in the order Liliales, for instance as the tribe Hyacintheae of the family Liliaceae. The availability of molecular phylogenetic methods in taxonomic classification led to major realignments of several related monocot orders, particularly with the adoption of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system. Significantly, hyacinth-like plants including &quot;Scilla&quot; were initially placed in a separate family, the Hyacinthaceae in the order Asparagales, specifically in the very large subfamily Hyacinthoideae. Since 2009, the Hyacintheae, including &quot;Scilla&quot;, have been considered as Scilloideae, a subfamily of the family Asparagaceae. There they are placed as one of about 21 genera in the subtribe Hyacinthinae within tribe Hyacintheae. The most closely related genera to &quot;Scilla&quot; were &quot;Muscari&quot; and &quot;Chionodoxa&quot; .

=== Subdivision ===

For some time, &quot;Chionodoxa&quot; had been considered a possible synonym to &quot;Scilla bifolia&quot; and molecular methods failed to support the existence of a separate genus, but rather its specimens appeared intermixed with those of &quot;Scilla&quot;. Although there are distinguishing morphological features (e.g. fused tepal bases and broadened filaments), these were considered paraphyletic, having arisen in several lines within the Hyacinthaceae. Furthermore, it was observed that &quot;Chionodoxa&quot; was capable of hybridization with &quot;Scilla bifolia&quot;. It was therefore proposed that &quot;Chionodoxa&quot; be considered an obsolete genus and be submerged within &quot;Scilla&quot;.

Subsequently, it was proposed that the species of Scilla be split into two sections, Chionodoxa that would include those taxa previously considered to belong in the genus &quot;Chionodoxa&quot;, and &quot;Scilla&quot; which would contain the remainder.

=== Species ===

The precise number of &quot;Scilla&quot; species in the genus depends on which proposals to split the genus are accepted. In addition to creating two sections, some authorities have split the genus into a number of smaller genera. For instance, particularly the Eurasian species have been moved to genera such as &quot;Othocallis&quot; , so that &quot;Scilla siberica&quot; would become &quot;Othocallis siberica&quot;, leaving a much smaller genus referred to as &quot;Scilla&quot; s.s. or &quot;Scilla&quot; &quot;sensu&quot; Speta, with about 30 species. However, this has not been generally accepted, leaving a much larger &quot;Scilla&quot; s.l. of about 80 species. Although the Flora of North America mentions (but does not list) 50 species, World Flora Online lists 83 species, as of May 2022. Speta&#x27;s scheme (1998) created 8 separate genera, but many of these are very narrowly defined being either monotypic (single species) or oligotypic (very few species).

=== Etymology ===

Both the scientific genus name &quot;Scilla&quot; and the common word &quot;squill&quot; derive, via Middle English and French, from the Latin &quot;scilla&quot; and Greek &quot;skilla&quot; words for the plants. The common name squill has been applied to a number of other similar taxa such as &quot;Drimia&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Native to woodlands, subalpine meadows, and seashores throughout Europe (especially the Mediterranean), Africa (especially South Africa), Eurasia (especially southwest Asia) and the Middle East. A few species are also widely naturalized, particularly in Australia, New Zealand and North America.

==Cultivation and uses==
Many &quot;Scilla&quot; species, notably &quot;S. siberica&quot; and members of section &quot;Chionodoxa&quot;, are grown in gardens for their attractive early spring flowers.

<doc id="431363" wikidata="Q435124" url="?curid=431363" title="Alexander Godunov">
<text>Alexander Borisovich Godunov (Russian: ; November 28, 1949 – May 1995) was a Russian-American ballet dancer and film actor. A member of the Bolshoi Ballet, he became the troupe&#x27;s Premier danseur. In 1979, he defected to the United States. While continuing to dance, he also began working as a supporting actor in Hollywood films. He had prominent roles in films such as &quot;Witness&quot; (1985) and &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988).

==Early life and dance career==
Godunov was born in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (Sakhalin, Russian SFSR, USSR) in the Russian Far East. He began his ballet studies at the age of nine in Riga in 1958 in the same class as Mikhail Baryshnikov. He said his mother put him in ballet to prevent him from becoming &quot;a hooligan&quot;. He and Baryshnikov became friends and helped each other throughout their years there.

Godunov joined the Bolshoi Ballet in 1971 and rose to become Premier danseur. His teachers there included Aleksey Yermolayev.

In 1973, Godunov won a gold medal at the Moscow International Ballet Competition. He received the title of Honored Artist of the RSFSR in 1976. After playing Vronsky in 1975&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; and Lemisson, the Royal minstrel, in the 1978 film version of J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;31 June&quot;, he became well-known in the Soviet Union as a movie actor.

==Defection from the USSR==
On August 21, 1979, while on a tour with the Bolshoi Ballet in New York City, Godunov contacted authorities and asked for political asylum. After discovering his absence, the KGB responded by putting his wife, Lyudmila Vlasova, a soloist with the company, on a plane to Moscow, but the flight was stopped before takeoff. After three days, with involvement by President Jimmy Carter and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, the U.S. State Department was satisfied that Vlasova had chosen to return to the Soviet Union of her own free will and allowed the plane to depart. The incident was dramatized in the Soviet docudrama film, &quot;Flight 222&quot; (1985). Vlasova later said that while Godunov loved American culture and had long desired to live in the United States, she felt she was &quot;too Russian&quot; to live in the United States. The couple divorced in 1982.

==Later career==
Godunov joined American Ballet Theatre and danced as a principal dancer until 1982, when he had a falling-out with Mikhail Baryshnikov, the director of the company. A press release for American Ballet Theatre stated a change in the troupe&#x27;s repertoire did not provide Godunov with sufficient roles. Following his release, he traveled with his own troupe and danced as a guest artist around the world with a number of prominent ballet troupes.

Godunov also began working in Hollywood as a film actor. His acting roles included an Amish farmer in &quot;Witness&quot; (1985), a comically narcissistic symphony conductor in &quot;The Money Pit&quot; (1986) and one of the thieves in &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988). He declined roles which typecast him as a dancer or as an action villain, as in &quot;Die Hard&quot;. In the mid-1990s he appeared in Canadian television commercials for Labatt Ice Beer.

==Personal life==
Godunov married Lyudmila Vlasova, a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, in 1971. The couple had no children and divorced in 1982 after a long separation.

In 1981, Godunov began dating actress Jacqueline Bisset after meeting her at a party in New York City. They broke up in 1988.

According to author Herbie J Pilato, Godunov had an affair with actress Elizabeth Montgomery while she was in a relationship with (but not yet married to) Robert Foxworth. Coincidentally, Godunov was found dead on the same day as Montgomery&#x27;s death, although it was believed he had been deceased for several days prior.

Godunov became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1987.

==Death==
Godunov drank alcohol to excess and this became a problem as he got older. On May 18, 1995, Godunov&#x27;s friends became concerned when he had been uncharacteristically quiet with his phone calls. A nurse, who had not heard from him since May 8, went to his home in the Shoreham Towers, West Hollywood, California, where his body was discovered. He had been dead for several days. Godunov&#x27;s death was determined to be due to complications from hepatitis secondary to chronic alcoholism.

Godunov was cremated and his ashes scattered into the Pacific Ocean. A memorial to him at Gates Mortuary in Los Angeles is engraved with the epitaph &quot;His future remained in the past.&quot;

<doc id="431369" wikidata="Q1519204" url="?curid=431369" title="Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect">
<text>The Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect (named after Rashid Sunyaev and Yakov B. Zeldovich and often abbreviated as the SZ effect) is the spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) through inverse Compton scattering by high-energy electrons in galaxy clusters, in which the low-energy CMB photons receive an average energy boost during collision with the high-energy cluster electrons. Observed distortions of the cosmic microwave background spectrum are used to detect the disturbance of density in the universe. Using the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect, dense clusters of galaxies have been observed.

== Overview ==
The Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect was predicted by Rashid Sunyaev and Yakov Zeldovich to describe anisotropies in the CMB. The effect is caused by the CMB interacting with high energy electrons. These high energy electrons cause inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons which causes a distortion in the radiation spectrum of the CMB. The Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect is most apparent when observing galactic clusters. Analysis of CMB data at higher angular resolution (high formula_1-values) requires taking into account the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect.

The Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect can be divided into different types:

* Thermal effects, where the CMB photons interact with electrons that have high energies due to their temperature
* Kinematic effects, a second-order effect where the CMB photons interact with electrons that have high energies due to their bulk motion (also called the Ostriker–Vishniac effect, after Jeremiah P. Ostriker and Ethan Vishniac.)
* Polarization

The Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect is of major astrophysical and cosmological interest. It can help determine the value of the Hubble constant, determine the location of new galaxy clusters, and in the study of cluster structure and mass. Since the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect is a scattering effect, its magnitude is independent of redshift, which means that clusters at high redshift can be detected just as easily as those at low redshift.

== Thermal effects ==
The distortion of the CMB resulting from a large number of high energy electrons is known as the thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect. The thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect is most commonly studied in galaxy clusters. By comparing the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect and X-ray emission data, the thermal structure of the cluster can be studied, and if the temperature profile is known, Sunyaev–Zeldovich data can be used to determine the baryonic mass of the cluster along the line of sight. Comparing Sunyaev–Zeldovich and X-ray data can also be used to determine the Hubble constant using the angular diameter distance of the cluster. These thermal distortions can also be measured in superclusters and in gases in the local group, although they are less significant and more difficult to detect. In superclusters, the effect is not strong (&lt; 8 μK), but with precise enough equipment, measuring this distortion can give a glimpse into large-scale structure formation. Gases in the local group may also cause anisotropies in the CMB due to the thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect which must be taken into account when measuring the CMB for certain angular scales.

== Kinematic effects ==
The kinematic Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect is caused when a galaxy cluster is moving relative to the Hubble flow. The kinematic Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect gives a method for calculating the peculiar velocity:
formula_2
where formula_3 is the peculiar velocity, and formula_4 is the optical depth. In order to use this equation, the thermal and kinematic effects need to be separated. The effect is relatively weak for most galaxy clusters. Using gravitational lensing, the peculiar velocity can be used to determine other velocity components for a specific galaxy cluster. These kinematic effects can be used to determine the Hubble constant and the behavior of clusters.

== Research ==
Current research is focused on modelling how the effect is generated by the intracluster plasma in galaxy clusters, and on using the effect to estimate the Hubble constant and to separate different components in the angular average statistics of fluctuations in the background. Hydrodynamic structure formation simulations are being studied to gain data on thermal and kinetic effects in the theory. Observations are difficult due to the small amplitude of the effect and to confusion with experimental error and other sources of CMB temperature fluctuations. To distinguish the SZ effect due to galaxy clusters from ordinary density perturbations, both the spectral dependence and the spatial dependence of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background are used.

A factor which facilitates high redshift cluster detection is the angular scale versus redshift relation: it changes little between redshifts of 0.3 and 2, meaning that clusters between these redshifts have similar sizes on the sky. The use of surveys of clusters detected by their Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect for the determination of cosmological parameters has been demonstrated by Barbosa et al. (1996). This might help in understanding the dynamics of dark energy in surveys (South Pole Telescope, Atacama Cosmology Telescope, &quot;Planck&quot;).

== Observations ==

In 1984, researchers from the Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group and the Owens Valley Radio Observatory first detected the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect from clusters of galaxies. Ten years later, the Ryle Telescope was used to image a cluster of galaxies in the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect for the first time.

In 1987 the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite observed the CMB and gave more accurate data for anisotropies in the CMB, allowing for more accurate analysis of the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect.

Instruments built specifically to study the effect include the Sunyaev–Zeldovich camera on the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment, and the Sunyaev–Zeldovich Array, which both saw first light in 2005. In 2012, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) performed the first statistical detection of the kinematic SZ effect. In 2012 the kinematic SZ effect was detected in an individual object for the first time in MACS J0717.5+3745.

As of 2015, the South Pole Telescope (SPT) had used the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect to discover 415 galaxy clusters. The Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect has been and will continue to be an important tool in discovering hundreds of galaxy clusters.

Recent experiments such as the OLIMPO balloon-borne telescope try to collect data in specific frequency bands and specific regions of the sky in order to pinpoint the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect and give a more accurate map of certain regions of the sky.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; ), also called the &quot;Kaiserhymne&quot; (; ), is an anthem composed in 1797 by Joseph Haydn. In its original version it was paired with lyrics by Lorenz Leopold Haschka and served as a patriotic song, expressing devotion to Francis II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. In later times, Haydn&#x27;s tune came to be widely employed in other contexts, often paired with new lyrics. These later versions include works of classical music, Christian hymns, alma maters, and the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot;, the present national anthem of Germany.

Lange lebe Franz der Kaiser, in des Glückes hellstem Glanz!

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;God save Francis the Emperor, our good Emperor Francis!
Long live Francis the Emperor in the brightest splendour of bliss!
May laurel branches bloom for him, wherever he goes, as a wreath of honour.
God save Francis the Emperor, our good Emperor Francis!&lt;/poem&gt;

==History==
The song was written when Austria was seriously threatened by Revolutionary France and patriotic sentiments ran high. The story of the song&#x27;s genesis was narrated in 1847 by Anton Schmid, who was Custodian of the Austrian National Library in Vienna:

Saurau himself later wrote:
I had a text fashioned by the worthy poet Haschka; and to have it set to music, I turned to our immortal compatriot Haydn, who, I felt, was the only man capable of creating something that could be placed at the side of ... &quot;God Save the King&quot;.

&quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&quot; was first performed on the Emperor&#x27;s birthday, 12 February 1797. It proved popular, and came to serve unofficially as Austria&#x27;s first national anthem.

==Composition==
As elsewhere in Haydn&#x27;s music, it has been conjectured that Haydn took part of his material from folk songs he knew. This hypothesis has never achieved unanimous agreement, the alternative being that Haydn&#x27;s original tune was adapted by the people in various versions as folk songs. For discussion, see Haydn and folk music.
Irrespective of the original source, Haydn&#x27;s own compositional efforts went through multiple drafts, discussed by Rosemary Hughes in her biography of the composer. Hughes reproduces the draft fragment given below (i.e., the fifth through eighth lines of the song) and writes: &quot;His sketches, preserved in the Vienna National Library, show the self-denial and economy with which he struggled to achieve [the song&#x27;s] seemingly inevitable climax, pruning the earlier and more obviously interesting version of the fifth and sixth lines, which would have anticipated, and so lessened, its overwhelming effect.&quot;

The original version of the song (see autograph score, above) included a single line for voice with a rather crude piano accompaniment, with no dynamic indications and what David Wyn Jones calls &quot;an unevenness of keyboard sonority&quot;. This version was printed in many copies (two different printers were assigned to the work) and sent to theatres and opera houses across the Austrian territories with instructions for performance. The Vienna premiere took place in the Burgtheater on 12 February 1797, the day the song was officially released. The Emperor was present, attending a performance of Dittersdorf&#x27;s opera &quot;Doktor und Apotheker&quot; and Joseph Weigl&#x27;s ballet &quot;Alonzo und Cora&quot;. The occasion celebrated his 29th birthday.

Not long after, Haydn later wrote three additional versions of his song:

*He first wrote a version for orchestra, called &quot;much more refined&quot; by Jones.
*During 1797, Haydn was working on a commission for six string quartets from Count Joseph Erdödy. He conceived the idea of composing a slow movement for one of the quartets consisting of the Emperor&#x27;s hymn as theme, followed by four variations, each involving the melody played by one member of the quartet. The finished quartet, now often called the &quot;Emperor&quot; quartet, was published as the third of the Opus 76 quartets, dedicated to Count Erdödy. It is perhaps Haydn&#x27;s most famous work in this genre.
*The last version Haydn wrote was a piano reduction of the quartet movement, published by Artaria in 1799. The publisher printed it with the original cruder piano version of the theme, though a modern edition corrects this error.

==Haydn&#x27;s own view of the song==
Joseph Haydn seems to have been particularly fond of his creation. During his frail and sickly old age (1802–1809), the composer often would struggle to the piano to play his song, often with great feeling, as a form of consolation; and as his servant Johann Elssler narrated, it was the last music Haydn ever played:

The &quot;Kaiser Lied&quot; was still played three times a day, though, but on 26 May [1809] at half-past midday the Song was played for the last time and that 3 times over, with such expression and taste, well! that our good Papa was astonished about it himself and said he hadn&#x27;t played the Song like that for a long time and was very pleased about it and felt well altogether till evening at 5 o&#x27;clock then our good Papa began to lament that he didn&#x27;t feel well...
Elssler goes on to narrate the composer&#x27;s final decline and death, which occurred on 31 May.

==Later uses of the tune in classical music==
Later composers in the Western classical canon have repeatedly quoted or otherwise employed Haydn&#x27;s tune, as is demonstrated by the following chronological list. As the tune was widely known, the uses by other composers were heard as quotations and served as an emblem of Austria, of Austrian patriotism, or of the Austrian monarchy.

*Philipp Jakob Riotte quotes the tune at the end of his battle piece &quot;Die Schlacht bei Leipzig&quot; (ca. 1814) in order to illustrate the joy after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of Leipzig.
*Ludwig van Beethoven quotes the last four bars in &quot;Es ist vollbracht&quot;, WoO 97, the finale of Georg Friedrich Treitschke&#x27;s singspiel &quot;Die Ehrenpforten&quot; (1815). The work celebrates the end of the Napoleonic Wars, essentially the same conflict that gave rise to Haydn&#x27;s original hymn. It is seldom performed today.
*Carl Czerny wrote Variations on &quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&quot; for piano and orchestra or piano and string quartet, his Op. 73 (1824).
*Gioachino Rossini used the tune in the banquet scene of his 1825 opera &quot;Il viaggio a Reims&quot; for the German Baron Trombonok.
*Niccolò Paganini wrote a set of variations on this tune for violin and orchestra in 1828, under the title &quot;Maestosa Sonata Sentimentale&quot;.
*Gaetano Donizetti used the tune in his opera &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; (1835), at act 3, scene 8, &quot;Deh! Tu di un&#x27;umile preghiera ...&quot;
*Clara Schumann used the tune as the basis for her &quot;Souvenir de Vienne&quot;, Op. 9 (1838) for solo piano.
*Bedřich Smetana used the tune in his &quot;Festive Symphony&quot; (1853), which the composer intended to dedicate to the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.
*Henryk Wieniawski wrote a set of variations on the tune for unaccompanied violin (&quot;Variations on the Austrian National Anthem&quot;, from &quot;L&#x27;école Moderne&quot;, Op. 10; 1853).
*John Knowles Paine wrote a set of concert variations on this tune for organ as his Op. 3 (1860) .
*Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky arranged the work for orchestra in 1874, apparently in connection with a visit to Russia by the Austrian Emperor. The arrangement was published only in 1970.
*Anton Bruckner wrote his &quot;Improvisationskizze Ischl 1890&quot; to be played on the organ during the wedding of Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria.
*Béla Bartók employed the theme in his symphonic poem &quot;Kossuth&quot; (1903); in this patriotic work about the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1848 the theme serves as an emblem for the Austrian enemy.

==Use in national anthems, alma maters, and hymns==

===Austria-Hungary===
After the death of Francis in 1835, the tune was given new lyrics that praised his successor, Ferdinand: &quot;Segen Öst&#x27;reichs hohem Sohne / Unserm Kaiser Ferdinand!&quot; (&quot;Blessings to Austria&#x27;s high son / Our Emperor Ferdinand!&quot;). After Ferdinand&#x27;s abdication in 1848, the original lyrics were used again because his successor (Francis Joseph) was also named Francis. However, in 1854, yet again new lyrics were selected: &quot;Gott erhalte, Gott beschütze / Unsern Kaiser, unser Land!&quot; (&quot;God preserve, God protect / Our Emperor, our country!&quot;).

There were versions of the hymn in several languages of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (e.g., Czech, 
Croatian, Slovene, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Polish, Italian).

At the end of the First World War in 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was abolished and divided into multiple states, one of them being the residual state of Austria, which was a republic and had no emperor. The tune ceased to be used for official purposes. When the last Emperor, Charles I, died in 1922, monarchists created an original stanza for his son Otto von Habsburg. Since the emperor was in fact never restored, this version never attained official standing.

The hymn was revived in 1929 with completely new lyrics, known as &quot;Sei gesegnet ohne Ende&quot;, which remained the national anthem of Austria until the Anschluss. The first stanza of the hymn&#x27;s 1854 version was sung in 1989 during the funeral of Empress Zita of Austria and again in 2011 during the funeral of her son Otto von Habsburg.

===Germany===
Long after Haydn&#x27;s death, his melody was used as the tune for Hoffmann von Fallersleben&#x27;s poem Das Lied der Deutschen (1841). The third stanza (which begins with &quot;Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit&quot;) is sung to the same melody, and is the present national anthem of Germany and formerly of West Germany. The first verse of Fallersleben&#x27;s poem was formerly the national anthem of the Weimar Republic, and later, Nazi Germany.

===Hymns===
In the ordinary nomenclature of hymn tunes, the melody of &quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&quot; is classified as 87.87D trochaic metre. When employed in a hymn it is sometimes known as &quot;Austria&quot;, or &quot;Austrian Hymn&quot;. It has been paired with various lyrics.

*Lyrics by John Newton which begin &quot;Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken/Zion, city of our God&quot;
*Lyrics by Samuel Longfellow which begin &quot;Light of ages and of nations&quot;
*Lyrics by an unknown author which begin &quot;Praise the Lord, Ye Heavens Adore Him&quot;

=== School Hymns ===
* The alma mater of Columbia University, &quot;Stand, Columbia&quot;
* The alma mater of the University of Pittsburgh
* The alma mater of Western Reserve University (merged into Case Western Reserve University)
* The alma mater of Ningbo No.2 High School, an educational institution located in Ningbo, China 
* The school song of Kwun Tong Government Secondary School
* The alma mater of Illinois State University

==Lyrics==
In addition to the German lyrics, the song has been translated into many other languages spoken in the Holy Roman Empire.

=== Original 1797 version ===
During Haydn&#x27;s lifetime, his friend the musicologist Charles Burney, made an English translation of the first verse which is more poetical albeit less literal than the one given above:

&lt;poem&gt;God preserve the Emp&#x27;ror Francis
Sov&#x27;reign ever good and great;
Save, o save him from mischances
In Prosperity and State!
May his Laurels ever blooming
Be by Patriot Virtue fed;
May his worth the world illumine
And bring back the Sheep misled!
God preserve our Emp&#x27;ror Francis!
Sov&#x27;reign ever good and great.&lt;/poem&gt;

Burney&#x27;s penultimate couplet about sheep has no counterpart in the original German and appears to be Burney&#x27;s own contribution.

=== 1854 version ===

Divisions were categorised as being &#x27;Regular Army&#x27; (professional), &#x27;Territorial Force&#x27; (part-time) or &#x27;New Army&#x27; (wartime). The &#x27;Territorial&#x27; cavalry was referred to as Yeomanry.

<doc id="431374" wikidata="Q7860972" url="?curid=431374" title="Typewriter desk">
<text>A typewriter desk (also sometimes called a typewriter table or typing table) is a desk form meant to hold a typewriter at the proper height for the typist&#x27;s hands while still allowing a seat height that is low enough to be comfortable for the typist&#x27;s feet. This height is usually a few inches lower than the height of the traditional desk. Without a proper typing desk or table, professional or student typists would sit on cushions or thick telephone books, so that their hands would be in the proper position to type comfortably.

The first generations of typewriters, in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, spurred the invention and production of a variety of typewriter desks.

All of the early typewriter desks were sturdy since typewriters needed to be heavy in order to maintain the alignment of the moving parts and not skid over the desk when the carriage was moved. Although newer and portable models became lighter, all-day typing on a portable machine was slower and uncomfortable compared to typing on a heavier office model.

Originally, typewriters were very costly machines which one tried to protect from dust or accidents. They were also very ungainly or even ugly to those unfamiliar with them, and getting them out of sight was useful for aesthetic reasons. Therefore, early typewriter desks often had some method for hiding the typewriter or getting it out of the way within the desk, sometimes by swiveling or turning it. Also, a &quot;typist&quot; was of lower status than was a &quot;secretary&quot; or general office worker, so if the machine could be moved out of view except when needed, the desk was no longer just for typing.

After World War I typewriters gradually became less costly and more common; the typewriter desk was more or less standardized into a few forms: the regular desk with a depressed center section, an L-shaped desk with a permanent or hinged (after removing the typewriter) lower level for the typewriter at the side, and versions incorporating lowering or hiding mechanisms. 

A popular alternative was the &quot;typing table&quot;, a low table just large enough for the typewriter (so that it could be rolled up to another desk) on thin legs with casters, equipped with brakes so that it would not roll away. Frequently such tables had hinged side-leaves to hold the typist&#x27;s copy when used stand-alone, but also allowing them to also be used next to a desk.

<doc id="431375" wikidata="Q1050052" url="?curid=431375" title="Commissioners' Plan of 1811">
<text>The Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 was the original design for the streets of Manhattan above Houston Street and below 155th Street, which put in place the rectangular grid plan of streets and lots that has defined Manhattan on its march uptown until the current day. It has been called &quot;the single most important document in New York City&#x27;s development,&quot; and the plan has been described as encompassing the &quot;republican predilection for control and balance ... [and] distrust of nature&quot;. It was described by the Commission that created it as combining &quot;beauty, order and convenience.&quot;

The plan originated when the Common Council of New York City, seeking to provide for the orderly development and sale of the land of Manhattan between 14th Street and Washington Heights, but unable to do so itself for reasons of local politics and objections from property owners, asked the New York State Legislature to step in. The legislature appointed a commission with sweeping powers in 1807, and their plan was presented in 1811.

The Commissioners were Gouverneur Morris, a Founding Father of the United States; the lawyer John Rutherfurd, a former United States Senator; and the state Surveyor General, Simeon De Witt. Their chief surveyor was John Randel Jr., who was 20 years old when he began the job.

The Commissioners&#x27; Plan is arguably the most famous use of the grid plan or &quot;gridiron&quot; and is considered by many historians to have been far-reaching and visionary. Since its earliest days, the plan has been criticized for its monotony and rigidity, in comparison with irregular street patterns of older cities, but in recent years has been viewed more favorably by urban planners.

There were a few interruptions in the grid for public spaces, such as the Grand Parade between 23rd Street and 33rd Street, which was the precursor to Madison Square Park, as well as four squares named Bloomingdale, Hamilton, Manhattan, and Harlem, a wholesale market complex, and a reservoir. Central Park, the massive urban greenspace in Manhattan running from Fifth Avenue to Eighth Avenue and from 59th Street to 110th Street, was not a part of the plan, as it was not envisioned until the 1850s. The numbering was also extended through Manhattan and the Bronx.

==History of the gridiron==

The gridiron layout of a town or city is not new; it is &quot;the most pervasive city design on earth&quot; and can be found in &quot;Italy and Greece, in Mexico, Central America, Mesopotamia, China [and] Japan.&quot; It existed in the Old and New Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt, in the Indus Valley cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro – where many historians claim it was invented – from where it may have spread to Ancient Greece. The Greek city of Miletus was rebuilt after destruction by the Persians on a grid plan, with Hippodamusoften called &quot;the father of European urban planning&quot;as the local originator of the rectilinear grid system for the city centered on the &quot;agora&quot;, a concept he probably did not invent, but had heard about from elsewhere. Hippodamus went on to spread the grid to Piraeus, Rhodes, and other cities in Greece.

The grid plan, or &quot;Hippodamian plan&quot;, was also utilized by the Ancient Romans for their fortified military encampments, or &quot;castra&quot;, many of which evolved into towns and cities; Pompeii is the best-preserved example of Roman urban planning using the gridiron system. In France, England, and Wales, &quot;castra&quot; evolved into &quot;bastides&quot;, agricultural communities under a centralized monarchy. This example was followed on the European continent in cities such as New Brandenburg in Germany, which the Teutonic Knights founded in 1248, and in the many towns planned and built in the 14th century in the Florentine Republic. The gridiron idea spread with the Renaissance, although in many cities, for instance London following the Great Fire of 1666, it failed to take root. However the rapid expansion of towns and cities during the early industrial revolution developed using a grid street plan such as Whitehaven in Cumbria. In British Empire cities, it necessitated the adoption of new neoclassical urban plans in particular the Scottish Enlightenment &#x27;New Towns&#x27; of Edinburgh of 1767 and Glasgow of 1781 were particularly influential in the English-speaking countries. In some European cities, such as Amsterdam and Paris, destruction of parts of the city by fire, warfare and other calamities offered an opportunity for the grid system to be used to replace more evolutionary street layouts, especially in outlying areas, while the central city, often sheltered behind medieval walls, remained organic and undesigned.

In the United States the gridiron now predominates. In areas that were under Spanish control, the 1753 Laws of the Indies specified the use of the gridiron in newly built communities, and the results can be seen in St. Augustine, Florida; Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico; and in San Diego, San Francisco, and Los Angeles in California. The French also built the nucleus of New Orleans, Louisiana on a grid, in part influenced by the Spanish Law of the Indies, which provided numerous practical models in the New World to copy from. Although some English colonial cities, such as Boston, had streets that adhered more to natural topography and happenstance, others, such as Savannah, Georgia, Baltimore, and Philadelphia had been built to the gridiron concept from the beginningin Philadelphia&#x27;s case, William Penn specified the city&#x27;s orthogonal pattern when he founded it in 1682, although its blocks turned out to be too large, encouraging the creation of intermediate streets, while James Oglethorpe&#x27;s Savannah, with its significantly smaller blocks, was not conducive to large-scale development, restricting the city&#x27;s economic influence. New Amsterdam, however, had not been laid out in a grid pattern by the Dutch. The streets of lower Manhattan were more organic, and incorporated Native American trails, cow paths, and streets that followed the topography and hydrology of the swampy land.

By the time of the passage of the federal Land Ordinance of 1785, the grid plan was firmly established in the US. The Ordinance required newly created states west of the original thirteen, to have rectilinear boundaries, rather than boundaries shaped by natural features, and within the new areas, beginning in the Northwest Territory, everything was to be divided into rectangles: townships were sixmiles by sixmiles , sections were onemile by onemile , and individual lots were . Cities such as Anchorage, Alaska; Erie, Pennsylvania; Miami, Florida; and Sacramento, California, all show the American preference for the grid. The effects of the Ordinance of 1785 have been called &quot;The largest single act of national planning in [American] history.&quot;

There was significant variation in the size of the grids used. Carson City, Nevada, may have the smallest at square and streets, while Salt Lake City, Utah, is much larger at square blocks surrounded by streets. The most popular appears to be the square block with streets that are wide. This size grid can be found in Anchorage; Bismarck, North Dakota; Missoula, Montana; Mobile, Alabama; Phoenix, Arizona; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

==History of New York City==
The streets of lower Manhattan had, for the most part, developed organically as the colony of New Amsterdamwhich became New York when the British took it over from the Dutch without firing a shot in 1664grew. The roads were a mixture of country lanes, short streets and Native American and animal trails, all shaped by haphazard history, happenstance and property ownership without any overarching order, until around 1800 when the Common Council of New York began to assert authority over the streetscape, promulgating regulations to keep them clear and to require new streets be approved in advance. They also began to lay assessments on property owners to pay for the cost of keeping the streets in repair. Beginning in 1803, the Council started to condemn streets which served no public purpose, and, importantly, took responsibility for building streets, which heretofore had been done by individual property owners.

===Private developments===
The first efforts at putting a grid onto Manhattan in some form came from private developers. In the early 1750s, Trinity Church laid out a small neighborhood around the new King&#x27;s Collegewhich would later become Columbia Universityin rectangular blocks. However, because the plan required landfill in the Hudson River, which would not happen until much later, the streets were never laid down. In 1762, the church had streets surveyed and laid down in a rectilinear grid in the &quot;Church Farm&quot;which ran from what is now Cortlandt Street to Christopher Streetand offered the plots to artisans and laborers at affordable rents.

The second instance came when the powerful De Lancey family decided to break up part of their vast estate in the 1760s, and laid out a grid of streets centered on &quot;De Lancey Square&quot;. As royalists, their holdings were confiscated after the American Revolution, but the streets remainedalthough a new street, Grand Street, was laid through the central square. The north–south streets of the De Lancey grid become the core north–south streets of the Lower East Side: Chrystie, Forsyth, Eldridge, Allen, Orchard and Ludlow Streets, and the grid became the pattern for additional streets laid out in the area.

The third instance of a privately developed grid in New York City came in 1788, when the long-established Bayard family, relatives of Peter Stuyvesant, hired surveyor Casimir Goerck to lay out streets in the portion of their estate west of Broadway, so the land could be sold in lots. About accommodated 7 east–west and 8 north–south streets, all wide, making up 35 whole or partial rectilinear blocks of width from east to west, and between and long north to southalthough near the edges of the estate the grid broke down in order to connect up with existing streets. The Bayard streets still exist as the core of SoHo and part of Greenwich Village: Mercer, Greene, and Wooster Streets, LaGuardia Place/West Broadway (originally Laurens Street), and Thompson, Sullivan, MacDougal, and Hancock Streets, although the last has been subsumed by the extension of Sixth Avenue.

At about the same time as the Bayards, Petrus Stuyvesant, the great-grandson of Peter Stuyvesant, intended to lay out a small grid of streets, nine by four, to create a village on his estate. The orientation of the streets was to be true north–south and east–west, not shifted, as Manhattan Island is, 29 degrees east of true north. The only street to actually be laid was the grid&#x27;s central east–west axis, Stuyvesant Street, which remains the one street in Manhattan oriented closely to true east and west.

===The surveying of the Commons===
====Goerck&#x27;s first survey====
Despite the fact that the city&#x27;s charters over the decadesthe Dongan Charter (1686), the Cornbury Charter (1708) and the Montgomerie Charter (1731)supported by specific laws passed by the province or state in 1741, 1751, 1754, 1764, 1774 and 1787, gave the city&#x27;s Common Council full powers over the creation of new streets, the Council rarely did so, independent of the actions of the various landowners who developed their property and ran streets through their projects as they saw fit, which were approved after the fact by the Council. Its first effort to do so came in June 1785 as part of the Council&#x27;s attempt to raise money by selling property.

The Council owned a great deal of land, primarily in the middle of the island, away from the Hudson and East Rivers, as a result of grants by the Dutch provincial government to the colony of New Amsterdam. Although originally more extensive, by 1785 the council held approximately , or about 9% of the island. Unfortunately, the land was not only of such poor qualitybeing either rocky and elevated or swampy and low-lyingthat it was not suitable for farming or residential estates, it was also difficult to get to because of both the lack of roads and access to waterways.

To divide the Common Lands, as they were called, into sellable lots, and to lay out roads to service them, the Council hired Casimir Goerck, one of a handful of officially approved &quot;city surveyors&quot;, to survey them. Goerck, who was related to the Roosevelt family by marriage, was instructed to make lots of about eachprecision in such matters was not to be expected with the available surveying tools, given the topography and ground cover of the Common Landsand to lay out roads to access the lots. He completed his task in December, only six months later, creating 140 lots of varying sizes. Although not laid out in a gridiron patternGoerck was not instructed to do somost of the lots were organized into two columns of 45 lots with a road between the columns. The lots were oriented as the lots of the future Commissioners&#x27; Plan would be, with the east–west axis longer than the north–south axis; their five-acre size would become the template for the Commissioners&#x27; five acre blocks; and Goerck&#x27;s middle road would eventually reappear on the Commissioners&#x27; Plan, without acknowledgment, as the wide Fifth Avenue.

====Goerck&#x27;s second survey====
Unfortunately for the Common Council, the disadvantages of the plots in the Common Lands worked against their sale, and there was no run on the market to buy them. Still, sales continued at a steady, if not spectacular, pace. By 1794, with the city growing ever more populated and the inhabited area constantly moving north towards the Common Lands, the Council decided to try again, hiring Goerck once more to re-survey and map the area. He was instructed to make the lots more uniform and rectangular and to lay out roads to the west and east of the middle road, as well as to lay out east–west streets of each. Later, the Commissioners would use Goerck&#x27;s East and West Roads for their Fourth and Sixth Avenues. Goerck&#x27;s cross streets would become the numbered east–west streets of the later plan. Goerck took two years to survey the 212 lots which encompassed the entire Common Lands. Again, impeded by tools and topography, Goerck&#x27;s work was somewhat less than precise. In 1808, John Hunn, the city&#x27;s street commissioner would comment that &quot;The Surveys made by Mr. Goerck upon the Commons were effected through thickets and swamps, and over rocks and hills where it was almost impossible to produce accuracy of mensuration.&quot; Often the streets intended to intersect at right angles would not quite do so.

Still, Goerck&#x27;s work in surveying the Common Lands was the basis for the Commissioners&#x27; Plan, as explained by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission: &quot;The Commissioner&#x27;s Plan borrowed heavily from Goerck&#x27;s earlier surveys and essentially expanded his scheme beyond the common lands to encompass the entire island.&quot; Historian Gerard Koeppel comments &quot;In fact, the great grid is not much more than the Goerck plan writ large. The Goerck plan is modern Manhattan&#x27;s Rosetta Stone...&quot;

===The Mangin–Goerck Plan===
In 1797, the Council commissioned Goerck and Joseph-François Mangin, another city surveyor, to survey Manhattan&#x27;s streets; Goerck and Mangin had each submitted individual proposals to the Council, but then decided to team up. Goerck died of yellow fever during the course of the project, but Mangin completed it and delivered the draft of the Mangin–Goerck Plan to the Council in 1799 for correction of street names; the final engraved versionmade by engraver Peter Maverick, who would also go on to engrave the published map of the Commissioners&#x27; Planwould be presented to the Council in 1803. However, Mangin had gone well beyond the terms of his commission, and the map not only showed the existing streets of the city, as instructed, but was also, in Mangin&#x27;s words, &quot;the Plan of the City ... such as it is to be...&quot;

In other words, the Mangin–Goerck Plan was a guide to where and how Mangin believed future streets should be laid out. It called for enlarging the tip of the island and using landfill to regularize its waterfront. He placed a number of street grids on land that was, at the time, agricultural or undeveloped. The grids, which had different baselines, met up, and there Mangin placed parks and public spaces. He extended the Bayard grid northward, the De Lancey grid to the east and north, and the true north–south/east–west streets of Stuyvesant into the East River. As Gerard Koeppel comments:

In sum, Mangin&#x27;s plan of the city &quot;such as it is to be&quot; was a synthesizing of patterns already establishing themselves at the suburban fringes of the city and, in the city proper, an orderly filling in east and west with linear streets out to continuous roads along the waterfronts. The city government hadn&#x27;t asked for it, but it seemed to be just what it wanted.

The Council apparently accepted the plan as &quot;the new Map of the City&quot; for four years, even publishing it by subscription, until political machinations perhaps engineered by Aaron Burr acting through the city&#x27;s street commissioner, Joseph Browne Jr., brought it into disrepute. Burrthe political enemy of Mangin&#x27;s mentor Alexander Hamiltonmay have been upset that the design of New York&#x27;s City Hall had gone to Mangin and his partner John McComb Jr., and not to Burr&#x27;s candidate, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, but for whatever reason, the plan was disavowed by the Council, and was no longer to be considered &quot;the new Map of the City.&quot; The Council ordered that copies which had already been sold be bought back if possible, and that a label warning of inaccuracies be placed on any additional copies sold. They stopped short at totally destroying the plan, but, still, neglect may have had the same effect: the original square engraved map has disappeared, and of the smaller versions only less than a dozen are extant, none in good condition.

Nevertheless, despite the Council&#x27;s official disavowal of Mangin&#x27;s layout of future streets, as the city grew the Mangin–Goerck Plan became the &quot;de facto&quot; reference for where new streets were built, and when the Commissioners&#x27; Plan was revealed in 1811, the area of the plan which the public had been warned was inaccurate and speculative had been accepted wholesale by the Commission, their plan being almost identical to Mangin&#x27;s in that area.

==The Commissioners&#x27; Plan==
===Genesis===
Politics may have caused the Common Council to officially decertify Mangin&#x27;s plan for the future expansion of the city, but the episode nonetheless was a step forward in the development of the city&#x27;s future. In the &quot;warning label&quot; the Council caused to have placed on copies of Mangin&#x27;s map was the statement that expansion of the city, such as shown on the map, was &quot;subject to such future arrangements as the Corporation may deem best calculated to promote the health, introduce regularity, and conduce to the convenience of the City.&quot; Here the Council was showing its willingness to consider actively planning for how the city would develop.

In 1806, they took a first step by hiring Ferdinand Hassler. Hassler, a Swiss mathematician and geodetic surveyor who was noted for his work on a topographic survey of Switzerland, had immigrated to Philadelphia in 1805, two years after the French invaded his country and made his work there impossible. Through the auspices of a merchant friend with friends in New York, in the spring of 1806, the Common Council commissioned Hassler to make an accurate map of Manhattan Island, which could be used as a basis for planning future development; it would be Hassler&#x27;s first substantial contract in the U.S. He accepted the job, and the terms: $5 per day for Hassler (), $4 a day for his assistant (), and $1 per day for expenses (), plus a budget sufficient to hire a surveying crew. He was scheduled to depart from Philadelphia in July, in time for at least part of the 1806 surveying season, but never appeared. Finally, in October, he sent his regrets: both he and his wife had taken ill on the day they intended to leave. Why they did not send word earlier, why Hassler did not press on at some point before October, and why the Common Council never thought to inquire of the whereabouts of their missing surveyor is not known. In any case, by October, the surveying season for 1806 was over, or close to it. Hassler soon received a federal appointmenthe would eventually head the Survey of the Coast (which was renamed the United States Coast Survey in 1836 and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878) so the Council was back at square one.

So, in 1807, they acted again. Optimists at that time expected the city&#x27;s population, then around 95,000 people, to expand to 400,000 by 1860, when, in fact, it reached 800,000 before the beginning of the Civil War. Faced with opposition and conflict from various political factions, including property owners whose private deeds conflicted with the property lines of the Mangin–Goerck, and the reality that any plan the Council came up with could be overturned by a subsequent Council, the city asked the state legislature for help. The Council said its goal was &quot;laying out Streets ... in such a manner as to unite regularity and order with the public convenience and benefit and in particular to promote the health of the City.&quot; At the time, foul air, or &quot;miasma,&quot; associated with sewage, standing water and low sunlight, was thought to be the cause of many diseases, and the city had lived through decades of epidemics of yellow fever.

In March 1807, the state legislature responded by appointing as a Commission the three men suggested by the Common Council to establish a comprehensive street plan for Manhattan: Gouverneur Morris, a Founding Father of the United States; the lawyer John Rutherfurd, a former United States Senator representing New Jersey and a relative to Morris by marriage; and the state Surveyor General, Simeon De Witt, a cousin of De Witt Clinton, who was the Mayor of New York City, a State Senator, and the most powerful politician in New York.

A month later, the legislature gave the Commissioners &quot;exclusive power to lay out streets, roads, and public squares, of such width, extent, and direction, as to them shall seem most conducive to public good, and to shut up, or direct to be shut up, any streets or parts thereof which have been heretofore laid out ... [but] not accepted by the Common Council.&quot; The jurisdiction of the Commission was all of Manhattan north of Houston Street, and into the Hudson and East Rivers 600 feet beyond the low water mark. They were given 4 years to have the island surveyed, and then to produce a map showing the placement of future streets. There were few specifications given to them about those streets, except that streets were to be at least wide, while &quot;leading streets&quot; and &quot;great avenues&quot; were to be at least wide.

The baseline of the Commissioner&#x27;s remit was set at Houston Street&quot;North Street&quot; at the time&quot;Art Street&quot;, which was located approximately where Washington Square North is today, and &quot;Greenwich Lane&quot;, now Greenwich Street. Greenwich Village, then independent of New York City, and the current West Village were not part of the area the Commission was to deal with.

Morris was not named the president of the Commission, but acted as such. A majority of Commissioners was required to make decisions. The Commissioners were authorized to be paid $4 a day for their work ()although Morris and Rutherfurd, both rich men, waived their feesand were empowered to enter onto private property in the daytime to undertake their duties; this was greeted with widespread hostility from property owners, but the Commission&#x27;s authority was explicit. They held, for instance, the &quot;exclusive power&quot; to close streets that interfered with their plan, a plan which landowners as well as the mayor, the Common Council and all other citizens of the city had no choice but to accept.

At the meetings of the Commission, which were infrequent and usually not attended by all three men, their primary concern was what kind of layout the new area of the city should have, a rectilinear grid such as was used in Philadelphia; New Orleans; Savannah, Georgia; and Charleston, South Carolina, or a more complex system utilizing circles, arcs or other patterns, such as the plan Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant had used in laying out Washington, D.C. In the end, the Commission decided on the gridiron as being the most practical and cost-effective, as &quot;straight-sided and right-angled houses are the most cheap to build and the most convenient to live in.&quot;

===Surveying the island===
====False start====
In order for the Commissioners to determine what the future of New York City&#x27;s streets would be, they needed to know the precise location of the current streets, which meant that most of the four years they were given for their task would be taken up with surveying Manhattan island.

The Commission&#x27;s first chief surveyor was Charles Frederick Loss, who, like Mangin and the deceased Goerck, was an officially recognized city surveyor, a position he received contingent on becoming a naturalized American citizen. Unfortunately Loss did not appear to be a very competent surveyor, as several of his ventures had serious errors, which eventually resulted in his being relieved of his position in 1811. Loss exhibited the same lack of ability as the chief surveyor for the Commission, and finally the Commission made an agreement with Loss that he would do only the first task that had been assigned to him: to make a map of Manhattan island, and get accurate measurements for the location of certain streets which would provide a framework for the plan of future streets. For this, Loss would receive no wages but a simple fee of $500 (). Loss was to deliver the map by May 1808.

====Randel joins the project====
The Commissioners&#x27; replacement as chief engineer and surveyor, John Randel Jr., took over the position in June 1808; the project would occupy him for most of the next 13 years. Randel had been apprenticed to De Witt, and when he became an assistant surveyor in De Witt&#x27;s office, he interpreted the field reports of other surveyors to draft maps based on them of land in the Adirondack Mountains and on the Oneida Reservation, mapped the Albany Turnpike between Albany and Schenectady and the Great Western Turnpike from Albany to Cooperstown, and surveyed property lots in Albany and in Central New York, particularly Oneida County When he was hired by the commissionon De Witt&#x27;s suggestion and with Morris&#x27; approvalhe was still a relatively inexperienced 20-year-old.

Randel&#x27;s surveying in 1808 had nothing to do with laying out the grid, which had not yet been determined as the final result of the Commission&#x27;s work. Instead, he was determining the topography and ground cover of the land and the placement of natural features such as hills, rocks, swamps, marshes, streams, and ponds, as well as man-made features such as houses, barns, stables, fences, footpaths, cleared fields and gardens. He was also carefully noting the locations of the three north–south roads that Goerck had laid down as part of his survey of the Common Lands. Goerck had not placed the lots and roads in the Common Lands in the context of the overall island, and this Randel did, thus allowing the Commissioners to know where, exactly, Goerck&#x27;s Common Lands grid was. This was important, because it could serve as a template for a grid for the entire island, should the Commission decide to go in that direction.

Randel wrote afterwards that in the course of his work he &quot;was arrested by the Sheriff, on numerous suits instituted ... for trespass and damage by ... workmen, in passing over grounds, cutting off branches of trees. &amp;c., to make surveys under instructions from the Commissioners.&quot; In August 1808, Randel was sued by a landowner for trespass and causing damage to the landowner&#x27;s property, such as cutting down trees and trampling on crops; $5000 was requested in damages, but the landowner received only $109.63, just enough to cover his court costs. Nonetheless, the potential for future problems was real. Gouverneur Morris asked the Common Council for a means of protecting the necessary actions of the surveyors, but, for political reasons, the council could not agree on a solution, and passed the buck, again, to the state legislature. With the Commissioners threatening to resign if something was not done about the &quot;vexatious interruptions&quot;, the legislature acted in 1809 with a law providing that if the needed actions to perform the survey could not be performed &quot;without cutting trees or doing damages&quot; and &quot;reasonable notice&quot; was to be provided by the Commission or the surveyors to the landowner, and they were to view the property together to assess the situation. The landowner was to present a bill for &quot;reasonable damages&quot;, which the city was to pay within 30 days; any disagreement among the parties as to what was reasonable would, of course, end up in court. The new law did not completely stop lawsuits, but it cut down their number, and allowed Randel to go about his business with a degree of immunity from legal entanglements.

In 1809, Randel&#x27;s surveying again seems to have been focused on positioning the Common Lands, and Goerck&#x27;s lots and streets in it, to the rest of the island. Goerck had shown their relationship to the Bloomingdale Road to the west, much of which would become part of Broadway, and the East Post Road to the east, a road which would be demapped by the Commissioners&#x27; Plan. Little is known about Randel&#x27;s surveying in 1810.

And in the meantime, the Commissioners were, generally speaking, distracted by various other personal and political business; although they metinfrequentlythere is no record of what they discussed, or if they were getting closer to a decision about what their plan would entail. Finally, on November 29, 1810, with the surveying season for that season over and only four months left before they were to report out their plan, they seemed to have arrived at a decision. On that date, Morris informed the Common Council that although more work was left to be done &quot;on the ground&quot;, the Commission itself had &quot;completed their work&quot; and would be able to make a report that would &quot;compl[y] substantially, if not literally within the law, shewing all the streets which to be laid out...&quot; Randel then spent a considerable amount of time in December meeting with Morris and perhaps the other Commissioners at Morris&#x27; estate in the Bronx, during which time it appears that the grid plan was born. At Morris&#x27; suggestion, the Common Council hired Randel to actually do the extensive work involved in making the grid a physical realityalthough city surveyor William Bridges (see below) also submitted a proposal to do the workand Randel began this work even before the Commissioners&#x27; Plan was announced publicly. A provisional contract between the Council and Randel was signed on December 31, the permanent contract being conditional on Randel delivering the final maps of the plan, which he did on March 22, 1811; the maps were filed by the Council&#x27;s clerk on April 2, two days before the Commission&#x27;s legal deadline.

Randel&#x27;s survey of the entire islandhad begun in 1808 and was completed in 1810, and he now prepared the drafts of the new grid without regard to the topography of the land. The three maps were large, almost nine feet in length when connected together. Commissioner Simeon De Witt said of Randel&#x27;s work that it was made &quot;with an accuracy not exceeded by any work of the kind in America.&quot; Randel himself would later write that &quot;The &quot;time&quot; within which the Commissioners were limited by the Statute to make their &quot;Plan&quot; of the streets, avenues, and public places on Manhattan [was] barely &quot;sufficient&quot; to enable them to comply with the &quot;letter&quot;, although not fully with the &quot;spirit&quot;, of the Statute.&quot; (italics in original)

===The plan===
The format chosen by the Commissioners was a rectilinear grid, or &quot;gridiron&quot;: straight streets and avenues intersecting each other at right angles. Legal historian Hendrick Hartog writes that their choice was resonant with the political values of the country, which only recently gained independence from Great Britain. According to Hartog, the grid was: &quot;...the antithesis of a utopian or futuristic plan.&quot; It extolled ordinary everyday life, and emphasized that &quot;government ought not to act in such a way as to create inequality of special privilege.&quot; The Plan&#x27;s &quot;hidden agenda&quot; was &quot;[t]he reconstruction of the natural environment to fit the requirements of republican authority.&quot; Even though &quot;[t]he Commissioners wrote as if all they cared about was protecting the investments of land developers and maintaining government-on-the-cheap ... the plan ... however, served to transform space into an expression of public philosophy,&quot; which emphasized equality and uniformity. &quot;In a city shaped by rectangular blocks, all structures and activities would look roughly the same. Individual distinctions, whether cultural, charitable, economic, or whatever, would have to find their place within a fixed, republican spatial organization.&quot;

====Streets and avenues====
The Commissioners published their plan in March 1811 in the form of an mapredrawn by the otherwise little known William Bridges from Randel&#x27;s original, and engraved by Peter Maverickwith an accompanying 54-page pamphlet. The grid had 12 primary 100 feet (30 m) wide north–south avenues and numerous cross streets arranged in a regular right-angled grid tilted 29 degrees east of true north to roughly replicate the angle of Manhattan island. The Commission chose not to use circles and ovals such as Pierre L&#x27;Enfant had used in his design of Washington D.C., convinced that simple rectangles were best, the most convenient and easiest to build on, and therefore the most conducive to the orderly development of the city. The combination of north–south avenues and east–west streets at the specified dimensions was the creation of approximately 2000 long, narrow blocks.

Except in the north and south ends of the island, the avenues would begin with First Avenue on the east side and run through Twelfth Avenue in the west. In addition, where the island was wider, there would be four additional lettered avenues running from Avenue A eastward to Avenue D. Some of the avenues, such as Twelfth Avenue, ran through land that did not as yet exist, but the state legislation which created the Commission also authorized the city to extend its boundaries into the Hudson and East Rivers, so the land required for these new streets would eventually be created. Broadway, an existing road, was not included in the 1811 plan, and was added to the grid later.

The plan also called for 155 orthogonal cross streets. The location of the cross streets was fixed at the boundaries of parcels into which the land had previously been divided. The basepoint for the cross streets was First Street: this was a short and inconspicuous street, which still exists, and originally ran from the intersection of Avenue B and Houston Street to the intersection of the Bowery and Bleecker Street. Peretz Square, a small, narrow triangular park bounded by Houston Street, 1st Street, and First Avenue, is the grid&#x27;s cornerstone.

The numbered streets running east–west are wide, with about between each pair of streets, resulting in a grid of approximately 2,000 long, narrow blocks. With each combined street and block adding up to about , there are almost exactly 20 blocks per mile. Fifteen crosstown streets were designated as wide: 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd, 57th, 72nd, 79th, 86th, 96th, 106th, 116th, 125th, 135th, 145th and 155th Streets.

The width of the crosstown blocks was irregular. The distance between First and Second Avenues was , while the block between Second and Third Avenues was . The blocks between Third and Sixth Avenues were , while the blocks between the avenues from Sixth to Twelfth were . Lexington and Madison Avenues were added after the original plan. The shorter blocks near the Hudson and East River waterfronts was purposeful, as the Commissioners&#x27; expected that there would be more development there at a time when water-based transportation was still significant. The Commission expected that street frontage near the piers would be more valuable than the landlocked interior, the waterfront being the location of commerce and industry of the time, and so it would be to everyone&#x27;s benefit to place avenues closer together at the island&#x27;s edges. Although varied, the width of all the avenues were sufficient to accommodate large numbers of horse-drawn mass transportation vehicles such as the omnibus, which would soon appear in Manhattan in the late 1820s, but the precursors to which had been operating in Paris as early as 1662, operated by philosopher Blaise Pascal.

A curiosity about the grid plan the Commissioners chose for New York City is that while many other cities used a square grid, they did not. Perhaps influenced by the dimensions of the island, which is longer north–south than it is east–west, Manhattan&#x27;s blocks are long rectangles, with the east–west dimension, while varied, larger than the big grid of Salt Lake City, while the north–south dimension, at , just longer than the small grid of Carson City. Historian Gerard Koeppel remarks that &quot;while the grid brought order to the place, it also made it a place of extremes.&quot;

In implementing the grid, existing buildings were allowed to remain where they were if at all possible, but if removal was necessary the owners would receive compensation from the city, although appeal was available to a special panel appointed by the state&#x27;s highest court. (See &quot;Opening&quot; and &quot;regulating&quot; the streets below) In 2011, it was estimated that 39% of the buildings north of Houston Street which were standing in 1811 (721 out of 1,825) had to be moved. On the other hand, if the plan improved the accessibility of a property, the city was authorized to levy an assessment on the owner for the improvement, a method previously used by the city after building public amenities, such as wells.

The Commissioners&#x27; Plan did not in any way specify what the size of individual lots within the blocks should be, although the size and rectangular nature of the blocks lent itself to rectangular lots of equal size to fit into the block. A standard lot was deep, which was half the depth of the block, and wide, depending on the location. By removing most of the topographical features which had once defined lot boundaries, the grid turned land into a commodity, which could be easily bought and sold in roughly equal-sized units, thus rationalizing the real estate market. Zoning requirements also contributed to the order brought by the grid: the city required buildings on avenues to be no more than three stories, and those on the streets no more than two. This, of course, changed over time.

====Public spaces====
Conspicuous by their relative absence from the plan were amenities for the city&#x27;s population, including parks and plazas. The legislature which had created the Commission called for it to provide public areas but, perhaps because they underestimated the growth potential of the city, they laid out very few of these. The primary one was the Grand Parade of between 23rd and 33rd Street and between Third and Seventh Avenues, which was to be an open space slated for military drilling and for use as an assembly point in the event the city was invaded. At the time, some thought that the Grand Parade might become a &quot;central park&quot; for the city, but the grounds were gradually reduced over the course of time, until what was left was the current Madison Square Park.

The Commission also placed squares significantly smaller than the Grand Parade at 53rd to 57th Street between Eighth to Ninth Avenues (Bloomingdale Square), 66th to 68th Street from Third to Fifth Avenue (Hamilton Square), 77th to 81st Streets between Eighth and Ninth Avenues (Manhattan Square), and 117th to 121st Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues (Harlem Square). Observatory Place, intended for a reservoir, stood at 89th to 94th Streets between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, and there was a large space in what became the East Village, from 7th to 10th Streets and from First Avenue to the East River, intended as a wholesale market complex.

Of the public spaces created by the Commission, only Manhattan Square has survivedsince 1958 called Theodore Roosevelt Park, with part of it called Margaret Mead Green since 1979as the grounds around the American Museum of Natural History. The park officially became a part of Central Park as of 1874. The Grand Parade was first reduced from to by 1815, and then demapped altogether, except for which survives as Madison Square Park. The market in the East Village was whittled down from to , then scrapped altogether, though a portion was later reclaimed for Tompkins Square Park.

One of the reasons behind the lack of inland open spaces in the plan was the belief of the Commissioners that the public would always have access to the &quot;large arms of the sea which embrace Manhattan Island&quot;, the Hudson and East Rivers, as well as New York Harbor. They considered that if New York was a city such as Paris or London, located along the relatively small Seine and Thames River, then more parkland &quot;for the benefit of fresh air and consequent preservation of health&quot; would have been necessary. The Commissioners did not consider the proliferation of roadways, docks, wharves, rail yards, quarries and commercial sites which would essentially block the public from access to the rivers until the late 20th century, when a combination of factors began to make the riversides once again accessible, at least in narrow strips of greenways.

====Randel and William Bridges====
There was a private controversy regarding the publication of the map of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan. Randel had begun to prepare a map to go to the engraver, using his original papers, when he found out that the council had given William Bridges, another of the handful of city-recognized surveyors, the right to do so. Bridges simply copied one of Randel&#x27;s previously published maps, which were in the public domain, without access to the supporting material Randel had accumulated, introducing errors as he did so, some of them possibly intentional, since he was legally bound not to copy the map exactly. Bridges published and copyrighted the resulting map as a private venture, leaving Randel out in the cold: his name did not appear anywhere on Bridges&#x27; map.

The conflict between the two men did not come to a head until three years later, in 1814, when Randel starting advertising his own version of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan map, which he said was &quot;more correct&quot; than the previously published onehe did not mention Bridges by namenot only because of the errors he claimed had crept into the map when Bridges copied it, but because he, Randel, &quot;has since completed the measurements and fixed monuments by contract with the [Common Council], [therefore] he alone is possessed of all the materials for this valuable work.&quot; He published a letter from Gouverneur Morris, who called Randel&#x27;s map &quot;an excellent work ... indispensable to those who wish to make themselves acquainted with the Topography of that interesting space which is comprizes . It appears to me more accurate than anything of the kind which has yet appeared. ... I consider it highly deserving of public patronage.&quot; Bridges shot back, commenting that Randel was &quot;unprincipled&quot;, and &quot;conceited&quot;, and lacking in &quot;honorable conduct&quot;. Randel, of course, responded, listing many, but not all, of the errors in Bridges&#x27; map, including islands that were not the right length, width, or in the wrong place, rocks and hills misplaced and mis-sized, rivers and forts too close to each other, missing and misplaced buildings, and streets shown as closed which were not. Bridges, whose reputation both as a surveyor and as a man was far from clean, did not reply, perhaps because his wife was sick at the time, and died several months after Randel&#x27;s second letter. In any case, Bridges himself died shortly after that, and Randel did not publish his map or have it engraved at that time, due to national security concerns connected with the War of 1812. He eventually published it in 1821.

===Executing the plan===
====Laying out the grid====
Marguerite Holloway, Randel&#x27;s biographer, divides his work in New York into three periods. The first, from 1808 to 1810, resulted in the 1811 publication of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan. The final phase was from around 1818 to 1821, when Randel and his first wife Matilda became high-quality cartographers, makers of maps. In 1811, it was time for Randel to enter stage two, during which he completed the necessary geodetic surveying and inscribed the grid into the land.

Even with the publication of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan, the work of gridironing Manhattan was far from done. Randel&#x27;s map only showed 16 elevation points for the entirety of Manhattan island, and many more would be needed. In addition, very few of the streets were actually placed into the physical landscape of the island; 125th Street, for instance, was the northernmost street for which Randel had an actual physical position. These tasks, that of completing the survey with elevations, along with marking the actual positions of the notional streets of the plan, would take Randel another six years, until about 1817, supervised by a committee of five alderman, as the Commission had disbanded once it had discharged its legal responsibility.

To do this work, Randel was given an allocation of $1,000 for surveying instruments (), but he also spent his own moneybetween $2,400 () and $3,000 ()developing seven surveying instruments which, among other benefits, would not vary in size because of temperature changes, resulting in great precision. An expert in Colonial era surveying equipment has expressed the opinion, after closely examining images of Randel&#x27;s new instrumentsthe pamphlet that explained them has been lostthat Randel was &quot;Basically ... a mechanical genius.&quot;

To inscribe the grid onto the land, Randel and his staff erected almost 1,600 markersprimarily long, square marble monuments inscribed with the number of the street, placed at each intersection. Where rocks prevented the use of the marble markers, they blasted a hole with gunpowder, inserted long iron bolts that were square, and embedded them with molten lead. In all, they positioned 1,549 marble markers and 98 iron bolts to define the pattern of the grid.

As Randel&#x27;s work proceeded, and landowners could see for themselves, on the ground and not on a map, where the planned streets would be, some of them took action to fight against the plan, not only destroying temporary measurement pegs, but also digging up the marble markers. Randel simply replaced the pegs and the markers, and the Common Council covered the cost of doing so, allocating Randel $4,000 (), although they refused to pay him $11,479.31 () he asked for to cover the cost of re-measuring with his new instruments what he had previously measured. The Council reasoned that it was Randel&#x27;s job to be accurate, so additional fees were not justified.

After 1813, when they were married, Randel&#x27;s wife Matilda joined him the Harlem house he rented, participating in his work by helping with drawing of maps, but not by going out on the surveying trips.

====Mapping the grid and the land====
As part of the third stage of his work, Randel intended to create an extremely large map of the city, at an unprecedented scale. This has been a part of the agreement between Randel and the Common Council in 1812, but had been forgotten by all except Randel. Somewhat peeved to be reminded of it six years later, the council nonetheless honored the contract, and officially commissioned Randel to make his map. This was done by way of by colored &quot;Farm Maps&quot; made at a scale of that overlaid Manhattan&#x27;s natural topography with the intended grid. When put together, the Farm Maps made a map of the city about long. It took Randel and his wife Matilda two years, from 1819 to 1820, to finish the maps, working from their new home, having moved to Orange, New Jersey. He needed, asked for, and received an extension from the Common Council to complete the task, and even then he did not quite make the deadline, delivering the last maps in September 1820, about four months late.

Randel&#x27;s Farm Maps are justly praised for their accuracy and usefulness. Historian Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, in his &quot;The Iconography of Manhattan Island, 1498–1909&quot; called them &quot;the most complete and valuable topographical record of the period that exists. It is, in fact, the only early topographical record of the island.&quot;

The Farm Maps also make clear why so many property owners were distraught about the coming of the grid, and why some of them tried to stop Randel and his crew from completing their work. The maps are replete with houses that are directly in the way of where streets were scheduled to run, and lots that would be bisected, trisected, or completely obliterated by the streets and avenues of the new grid. It is no wonder why people fought back against the Commissioners&#x27; Plan, or set their dogs on Randel and his men.

As well as the Farm Maps, Randel produced an atlas of the city, filling in with &quot;astounding precision&quot; the details of street locations and elevations which had been left off the official map.

====&quot;Opening&quot; and &quot;working&quot; the streets====
The process of creating one of the streets gridded on the Commissioners&#x27; map was two-fold. First, the city had to acquire the land, compensating the owner for doing so. This was called &quot;opening&quot; the street. This was followed by &quot;working&quot; the street, which consisted of regulating, grading, and paving it. Most of the cost of this was passed on to property owners by way of assessments.

The process began when the Street Commissioner recommended to the Common Council that a certain street, or part of a street, be opened, and the Council would ask the New York State Supreme Court to appoint a Commission of Estimate and Assessment, as described below.

=====Opening=====
With the grid inscribed on the landscape with markers and pegs, the actual streets had to be &quot;opened&quot;, and they also had to be paid for. The city had no great reserve of money, and no regular income stream, so they developed a mechanism to pay for the opening and building of the streets, and for compensating the landowners whose property would be used for them. The 1807 law had specified that the city would calculate damages to the landowners&#x27; property as well as assess the benefits the landowners would receive from the new streets. Any disagreement between the parties could then be appealed to the state supreme court. Unfortunately, such a system would not be sufficient for the number of streets and avenues called for by the Commissioners&#x27; Plan, so the Common Council approached the state legislature with a new one, which they approved in a new law in April 1813.

In the new system, the state supreme court would appoint three &quot;commissioners of appraisal and estimate&quot; for the street to be openedgenerally local surveyors or other people familiar with the area the street would pass throughto evaluate the cost of the land being taken, and the beneficial value of the new street to the landowner. The appraisal commission could assess the city with as much as a third of the cost of the openingraised to 50% in 1869and the remainder of the cost would come from the difference between the beneficial value and the value of the property. The supreme court would then review the figures and ask for revisions or approve them. The result was &quot;binding and conclusive.&quot;

=====Working=====
Once the street was legally &quot;opened&quot; with the approval by the court of the commission&#x27;s figures, the city collected the assessment from the landowners along the street, and once the assessment was totally collected, the streets could be built, or &quot;worked&quot;. The land was cleared, hills were excavated or hollows filled in, the right of way was leveled and the street was paved. Many years could pass between when a street was &quot;opened&quot; and when it finally began to resemble a city street, having been cleared, leveled, graded and paved. The grading was often difficult because of the rocky nature of the island, especially on the West Side. In 1843, Isaacher Cozzens described the ground as &quot;a tough cement of clay, gravel, and boulders, very hard to dig. In digging through 42nd Street, the pickaxes had to be used for every shovelful of this clayey cement which formed what is called, a hard-pan, of about fourteen feet or more.&quot;

The decision on what the elevation of the street would be fell to the Common Council, as the commission for each street was disbanded once the street had been opened. The Council was aggressive in administering the street plan, even causing John Jacob Astor to back down when he challenged their decisions.

Of course, the new system did not stop landowners from appealing the assessments made by the streets commissionsgenerally speaking, landowners who had inherited their property were more inclined to appeal assessments than were land speculators, who simply paid the assessments and waited for the values of their properties to rise, as they inevitably did. The outcomes of the landowner appeals, together with those of the lawsuits against the plan which had been filed as early as 1810, created a body of precedents by which the state law was administered. Most of the appeals failed, in particular those that claimed that the Plan was an unlawful taking of property, since eminent domain was a well-established principle of law, although its use on such an extensive basis in New York City was new.

=====&quot;Boss&quot; Tweed ups the ante=====
Because of the inequities of the street opening and regulating system, in which property owners were assessed multiple times, and it could take years for just a few blocks to be completed, and because of increasing corruption once Tammany Hall came into power, the state legislature changed the system in 1869. In the new arrangement, the city could pay for 50% of the cost of building streets above 14th Street, and up to 100% below that line, through general tax revenues. This new system was very long-lived: it remained in effect until 1961, when a new city charter came into effect.

Tammany Hall took the new system in its stride, as it pushed a new city charter through the Tammany-controlled legislature in 1870. The new charter invested most of the city&#x27;s power in the Board of Apportionment, consisting of the mayor, the comptroller, the commissioner of parks and the commissioner of public works, who were, of course, all Tammany men loyal to William M. &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed. These same men, with slight variations, were also the Board of Supervisors, the Board of Audit, and the Board of Street Openings, creating vast new opportunities for graft and corruption. Tweed himself was the head of the Department of Public Works, and controlled when and where the grid would be activated. The pace of the expansion of the grid picked up tremendously, but so did the money going into Tweed&#x27;s pockets, as Tweed invested in land and then increased its value by opening streets in the areas he had invested in. Tweed&#x27;s investments were all over the city, but especially on the East Side. Tweed was eventually tried and jailed, but in his wake he left a city whose development had pushed ahead of its previous sluggish pace, as well as a city raked with debt, since rather than raise taxes for the public works he ordered, the city borrowed money on a massive scale, doubling its debt load in just two years, from $36 million in January 1869 to $73 million.

Overall, it took approximately 60 years for the grid to be implemented all the way to 155th Street.

====The topography of Manhattan====
A frequent charge laid by the critics of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan is that the excavation and leveling necessary to implement it basically destroyed the topography of Manhattan. Recent studies, however, have shown that while the topography of the island certainly changed, what exists now is not so very different from the original topography as the critics would suggest.

Reuben Rose-Redwood and Li Li compared Randel&#x27;s elevation data to modern data and found that while there had been some levelingin general the West Side had been smoothed out and the East Side had been filled inthe overall average change was low. Rose-Redwood commented: &quot;[T]he majority of the alterations were only on the order of a few meters or less, and the historical profiles of Manhattan&#x27;s avenues are very similar to the contemporary transects of those same thoroughfares.&quot; Infilling led to an average increase of and excavation to an average decrease of , but the West Side remains hillier than the East Side, just as was the case before the grid. Rose-Redwood writes that &quot;Manhattan remains an &#x27;island of hills&#x27; ...&quot;

==Modifications and extensions==

By 1865, Andrew Haswell Green reported, there had been 38 separate state laws passed which modified the original grid of 1811.

===Central Park and other alterations===

By far the largest alteration to the Commissioners&#x27; Plan was the creation of the Central Park between 59th and 110th Streets and Fifth and Eighth Avenues.

The concept of the park first came up for public discussion in the 1840s. By and large its advocates were wealthy landowners and merchants, who argued that New York lacked the kind of parks that graced cities such as London and Paris, and that the creation of such a park would enhance New York&#x27;s reputation as an international city. With the population of the city growing, there was an intense need for public spaces, which the Commissioners&#x27; Plan had been notoriously short on providing for. In 1853, the state legislature authorized the city to use eminent domain to acquire the necessary land. Four years later it appointed a Central Park Commission, led by Andrew Haswell Green, to build the park. The commission held a design contest, which was won by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux&#x27;s &quot;Greensward Plan&quot;. Construction started in 1857, and in 1863 the northern boundary was moved from 106th Street, where it had originally been set, to 110th Street. In 1870 the park passed from state control to local control when a new city charter came into effect. The park was completed by 1876.

Significant to the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 was the fact that Green was an outspoken critic of the grid. In 1867, he convinced the state legislature to give his Central Park Commission the power to make changes in the grid above 59th Street. However, even though few streets in that area had been laid out yet, property lines conformed to the grid, making sweeping changes to it difficult to achieve. Green was able to take advantage of a high ridge and create Morningside Park and Morningside Drive, and also created Riverside Park along the Hudson River; both parks were designed by Olmsted and Vaux. Green also laid out a broad Boulevardnow Broadwayup the center of the West Side.

Because a formal planning commission in support of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan was not created, there was no authority outside of the Common Council to protect its integrity. Thus the elimination of the Grand Parade and the wholesale marketplace and the addition of Union, Tompkins, Stuyvesant and Madison Squares came about, as well as the already noted additions of Lexington and Madison Avenues. Fourth and Sixth Avenues were extended downtown, and Broadway uptown.

Other interruptions of the 1811 plan include college campuses (Columbia University, City College of New York, Fordham University at Lincoln Center), parks (Marcus Garvey Park, St. Nicholas Park; Jackie Robinson Park), hospitals (Mount Sinai Hospital, Metropolitan Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center), churches (the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Trinity Cemetery and the Church of the Intercession), numerous New York City Housing Authority housing projects, as well as other housing complexes (Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village, Penn South, Lincoln Towers), cultural institutions (Lincoln Center), American Museum of Natural History, office complexes (Rockefeller Center), and transportation (Grand Central Terminal, Pennsylvania Station), convention (Jacob K. Javits Center), and sports (Madison Square Garden) facilities.

===Above 155th Street===
The Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 stopped at 155th Streetexcept for 10th Avenue which was extended to the northern tip of the island but as the city grew, and subsumed what had been independent villages such as Greenwich Village and Manhattanville, it became clear that a plan of action would be needed for the part of Manhattan above that line. The Common Council directed the city&#x27;s street commissioner to develop a plan for Upper Manhattan in 1851, but no money was allocated for the task, so there was no result. In any case, any street plan for that area would have had a difficult time in extending the simple rectilinear grid created by the Commissioners for the area below 155th Street, because the topography of Upper Manhattan was significantly more difficult to tame, consisting as it does of extremely steep hills, high ridges made of hard Manhattan schist, and deep valleys caused by tectonic fault lines at what is now Dyckman Street, which transects the Fort Washington Ridge; 155th Street; and at 125th Street, which crosses the Manhattan Ridge to create the Manhattanville Valley.

Even before the publication of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan, the Common Council had agreed with the founder of Manhattanville, Jacob Schieffelin, to grade and pave that community&#x27;s main road, Manhattan Street, which was part of a grid which was rotated significantly farther to the east than the Commissioners&#x27; grid would have put it. When push came to shove, and the question of whether the street they had paid a contractor $600 to create should be demapped and uncreated, the Council decided instead to keep the street, and in 1849 it was officially connected to the western portion of 125th Street. It remains today, with its original bend. One other Manhattanville street was also kept, which became the western portion of 126th Street.

With the need for a street plan for Upper Manhattan, in 1860 the state legislature created another commission, this one of seven residents of Upper Manhattan and called the Fort Washington Commissionwith Olmsted and Vaux as consulting landscape architectsto come up with a plan of action which would not be a copy of the grid plan promulgated by the original Commission. The new plan was to take into account &quot;the elevated, irregular, and rocky formation of that district&quot; because it would be &quot;impracticable and ruinous to land owners, and injurious to the interests of the city, to grade and layout streets and avenues ... upon the present plan of the city.&quot; However, due to the influence of businesses, land speculators and railroad interests, the plan created by the new commission in 1863 essentially called for an extension of the original grid, and by 1865 the legislature had disbanded the commission, and turned over responsibility for an Upper Manhattan street plan to Andrew Haswell Green&#x27;s Central Park Commission.

The commission did extensive due diligence on the area, studying property ownership, population density, sanitation, the jobs of the residents, food and supplies distribution patterns, defensive needs, even the winds and weather of the region, and in 1868, a plan was published which called for grids in the valleys, but also streets, avenues and parks which conformed to the topography of the land. Green said about the results of his commission&#x27;s plan that it created &quot;the only portion of Manhattan Island where any trace of its pristine beauty remains undesecrated and unrased by the leveling march of so-called &#x27;public improvements.&#x27;&quot;

Several other avenues were added to the grid when Upper Manhattan was developed, such as Riverside Drive, Claremont Avenue, and Saint Nicholas Avenue. The old Bloomingdale Road and Broadwaywhich are pictured on the original 1811 map, but which were not part of the original planned gridwere eventually combined together as Broadway was extended northward; it also took in part of the Kingsbridge Road in upper Manhattan.

Upper Manhattan did not develop exactly as Green and the Central Park Commission envisioned, but its difference from the grid of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan is still clear.

=== The Bronx ===
As New York City grew north into the Bronx at the end of the 19th century, the numbering scheme was extended into the Bronx, albeit haphazardly. The development of the town of Morrisania in the 1850s saw the first instance of the gridiron spreading beyond the island of Manhattan, extending the grid through what is now Mott Haven to at least 147th Street. By 1879, the numbering had extended through the former towns of Morrisania and West Farms (having been absorbed into New York County), extending to 189th Street. By 1909, the grid had extended to the northern border of the Bronx, ending at 263rd Street in North Riverdale. However, the extension of the grid was not uniform. East of Riverdale, the grid was an expansion of Mott Haven&#x27;s extension of the grid. This was done without conforming to Manhattan&#x27;s spacing of streets, opting for greater space between them, and in the case of Morrisania and Wakefield, using existing street systems; thus the system terminates at the city&#x27;s north line at 243rd Street. Meanwhile, the system in Riverdale was extended from Manhattan&#x27;s extension of the grid north of 155th St, resulting in twenty street numbers more than the rest of the Bronx. The farthest east the numbering scheme goes is Eastchester, where 233rd St terminates. The only avenue to extend into the Bronx is Third Avenue, reaching into Belmont.

===Avenues and streets===
For the most part, with the exception of the streets which were displaced by Central Park, the east–west streets of the Commissioners&#x27; Planwhich did not, by design, include Greenwich Villagehave remained as they were originally drawn and numbered. As mentioned above, the western ends of 125th and 126th Streets are another exception, as are some streets around the parks which developed, such as Central Park South. Of course, various streets have been blocked from continuing straight through from one side of the island to the other by parks, apartment complexes, college campuses, and so on, but, in general, the east–west part of the grid is intact.

One proposal for a change was made in 1915 by Thomas Kennard Thomson, an engineer from Buffalo, New York who settled in New York City after making a career in Canada and the United States as a bridge and railway engineer. Thompson opened an office in New York in 1893 which concentrated on the foundations of skyscrapers and underwater caissons used for building bridges. He was involved in the construction of the Singer Tower, the Manhattan Municipal Building and the Mutual Life Building. His 1915 plan was aimed at relieving congestion at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Thompson proposed to run 42nd Street &quot;under&quot; Fifth Avenue, and to add a mid-block street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues from 42nd to 43rd Streets to permit the turns that the tunneling would prevent. Why this plan would not simply shift the congestion to the new mid-block connector is not clear. In modern actions to relieve congestion, changes are generally made within the existing right-of-way, therefore without the need to condemn and purchase very expensive Manhattan property.

As opposed to the east–west streets, the north–south avenues have undergone some significant changes. They have, for one thing, increased in number, and many of them have been re-named over the years.

In the 1830s and 40s, two additional avenues were interpolated between the original avenues, largely due to the influence of real estate speculator Samuel B. Ruggles: Lexington Avenue, known south of 20th Street as Irving Place, was built between Fourth and Third Avenues to service Ruggles&#x27; Gramercy Park development, and Madison Avenue was built between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. Another interpolated avenue, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues from 14th Street to Central Park, was proposed in 1910 by Mayor William Jay Gaynor, who put great effort into promoting it. The plan died, however, when Gaynor was shot by an outraged landowner whose property would be taken for the new road. Gaynor survived, but was not able to put the necessary energy into his proposal, and it faded away. These interpolations were felt necessary because, essentially, the Commissioners had left gaps between Third and Fourth, Fourth and Fifth, and Fifth and Sixth that were too large to allow sufficient real estate development.

Of the Commissioners&#x27; original avenues, only First, Second, Third, and Fifth Avenues and Avenues C and D have never been renamed, though some of the named avenues, such as Avenue of the Americas (Sixth), are also known by their numbers.

* Fourth Avenue: Union Square East (14th–17th Streets), Park Avenue South (17th–32nd Streets), Park Avenue (32nd–135th Streets; as of 1888)
* Sixth Avenue: Avenue of the Americas (co-named, to Central Park South), Lenox Avenue/Malcolm X Boulevard (co-named, 110th–147th Street)
* Seventh Avenue: Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard (110th–153rd Street)
* Eighth Avenue: Central Park West (Columbus Circle to Frederick Douglass Circle; as of 1883), Frederick Douglass Boulevard (Frederick Douglass Circle to Harlem River Drive at 154th Street)
* Ninth Avenue: Columbus Avenue (59th–110th Streets; as of 1890)
* Tenth Avenue: Amsterdam Avenue (59th Street to Fort George Avenue at about 193rd Street; as of 1890)
* Eleventh Avenue: West Side Highway (14th–22nd Streets); West End Avenue (59th–107th Streets; as of 1880)
* Twelfth Avenue: West Side Highway (22nd–59th Streets)

Over the years, portions of Avenue A were renamed Sutton Place in Midtown Manhattan, York Avenue on the Upper East Side and Pleasant Avenue in East Harlem. Portions of Avenue B were also renamed East End Avenue in Yorkville.

Portions of the lettered avenues north of 14th Street were lost in the development of Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village after World War II. As late as 1943, Avenue A went as far north as 25th Street, Avenue B ended at 21st Street and Avenue C reached 18th Street.

===Broadway===
Broadway, which was the main north–south artery of the colonial city, originally ended at 10th Street, where it merged with the Bloomingdale Road, which then wandered up to approximately 147th Street, where it turned into the Kingsbridge Road. The combined streets took a fairly haphazard path as they made their way uptown. The Commissioners&#x27; Plan retained Broadway and Bloomingdale Road up to 23rd Street, with the intention that the uptown sections would be demapped. However, Bloomingdale Road as far as 43rd Street was officially restored in 1838, up to 71st Street in 1847, then in 1851 to 86th Street, with each section being straightened, often in parallel to the grid, as it was restored. In 1865, it was restored all the way to Spuyten Duyvil Creek, the top of Manhattan. The section below 59th Street was called Broadway, but Andrew Haswell Green called the section from 59th to 108th Street &quot;The Boulevard&quot;. Finally in 1899, the entire road was named Broadway, and the other names, not only Bloomingdale Road, The Boulevard, and Kingsbridge Road, but also Middle Road, Old Harlem Road and the East Post Road all disappeared. In modern New York City, Broadway, along with the avenues and the major cross-streets, is considered to be one of the major arterial roads.

The angled course of Broadway below 59th Street creates Herald, Times, Madison and Union Squares. Architect Rafael Viñoly refers to these unplanned intersections as &quot;happy accidents&quot;.

==Reaction==


===Criticism===
The plan was also vociferously criticized from the start, not least because it did not take into account the natural topography of the island, but also because it took no notice of classical ideas about beauty, and was monotonous in its regularity. It was also lambasted for being made in service of monetary interests alone. Among the many critics of the plan were Edgar Allan Poe and Alexis de Tocqueville who believed that it fostered &quot;relentless monotony&quot;. Walt Whitman, the poet and editor of &quot;The Brooklyn Eagle&quot;, said of it: &quot;Our perpetual dead flat and streets cutting each other at right angles, are certainly the last thing in the world consistent with beauty of situation.&quot;

Frederick Law Olmsted, who would co-design Central Park, and has been called &quot;the grid&#x27;s most significant nineteenth-century critic&quot;, facetiously said of the grid&#x27;s origin:

There seems to be good authority for the story that the system of 1807 was hit upon by the chance occurrence of a mason&#x27;s sieve near the map of the ground to be laid out. It was taken up and placed upon the map, and the question being asked &quot;what do you want better than that?&quot;, no one was able to answer. This may not be the whole story of the plan, but the result is the same as if it were.

Olmsted also said of it in 1858:

The time will come when New York will be built-up, when all the grading and filling will be done, when the picturesquely varied rock formations of the island will have been converted into the foundations for rows of monotonous straight streets, and piles of erect angular buildings. There will be no suggestion left of its present varied surface, with the single except of the few acres contained in [Central] Park.

Olmsted was clearly no fan of the grid plan: &quot;The great disadvantage under which New-York labors is one growing out of the senseless manner in which its streets have been laid out. No city is more unfortunately planned with reference to metropolitan attractiveness.&quot; Still, by 1876, even Olmsted had to admit that the grid had prevailed.

In 1818, Clement Clarke Moore, the author of &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;probably better known as &quot;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;whose estate &quot;Chelsea&quot; would be chopped up by the plan, wrote in &quot;A Plain Statement, addressed to the Proprietors of Real Estate, in the City and County of New York&quot; :

The great principle which governs these plans is, to reduce the surface of the earth as nearly as possible to dead level. ... The natural inequities of the ground are destroyed, and the existing water courses disregarded. ... These are men who would have cut down the seven hills of Rome. We live under a tyranny with respects to the rights of property, which ... no monarch in Europe would dare to exercise ... it is a tyranny of the worst kind; for it is under the sanction of laws which shield those who exercise it from being called to legal account. It is time for all who are interested to arouse, and to unite themselves for the maintenance and preservation of their rights.

Moore signed his pamphlet as &quot;A Landowner&quot;, but it was not long before his identity was exposed. Despite these vehement objections and his call to arms, Moore later made a great deal of money by sub-dividing his estate and developing it section-by-section along the gridded streets. Ironically, it was the landowners like Moore, who fought the grid most insistently, who made the most money from exploiting it.

Edith Wharton bemoaned &quot;...rectangular New York ... this cramped horizontal gridiron of a town without towers, porticoes, fountains or perspectives, hide-bound in its deadly uniformity of mean ugliness,&quot; while her friend Henry James wrote that:

New York pays the penalty of her primal topographic curse, her old inconceivably bourgeois scheme of composition and distribution, the uncollected labor of minds with no imagination of the future and blind before the opportunity given them by their two magnificent water-fronts. This original sin of the longitudinal avenues perpetually, yet meanly intersected, and of the organized sacrifice of the indicated alternative, the great perspectives from East to West, might still have earned forgiveness by some occasional departure from its pettifogging consistency. But, thanks to this consistence, the city is, of all great cities, the least endowed with any blest item of stately square or goodly garden, with any happy accident of surprise, any fortunate nook or casual corner, any deviation, in fine, into the liberal or charming. That way, however, for the regenerate filial mind, madness may be said to liethe way of imagining what might have been and putting it all together in the light of what so helplessly is.

Architect Julius Harder wrote in 1898 in &quot;The City&#x27;s Plan&quot;:

The street plan ... had only the dubious merit of the most childish regularity and of devoting the maximum proportion of area to building sites. Every consideration of economy of intercommunication, future financial economy, sanitation, healthfulness and aesthetics was absolutely left out of the reckoning.

Historian and architect Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes wrote in &quot;The Iconography of Manhattan Island, 1498–1909&quot;, recounting the city&#x27;s history, that in 1811:

We have now reached the point where the old city, which had grown up haphazard, with crooked streets, wooded hills, and fertile valleys traversed by streams and winding country roads, begins to be absorbed into a new city, in which antiquity and nature are no longer respected, with streets laid out in accordance with a carefully considered symmetrical plan. ... Unfortunately, this plan, although possessing the merits of simplicity and directness, lacked entirely the equally essential elements of variety of picturesqueness, which demand a large degree of respect for the natural conformation of the land. The new plan was entirely deficient in sentiment and charm, and with its gradual development, little by little, the individuality, the interest, and the beauty of one choice spot after another have been swept away [until] scarcely anything remains to remind us of the primitive beauty and the fascinating diversity of natural charms we know Manhattan once possessed. The year 1811 marks the end of the little old city and the beginning of the great modern metropolis.

Noted architecture critic Lewis Mumford, a vehement protester against the plan, complained about the &quot;blank imbecility&quot; of this &quot;civic folly&quot; with its &quot;long monotonous streets that terminated nowhere, filled by rows of monotonous houses.&quot; He wrote in &quot;The City in History&quot; (1961): &quot;Such plans fitted nothing but a quick parcelling of the land, a quick conversion of farmsteads into real estate, and a quick sale.&quot; Thirty years earlier, in &quot;The Plan of the City&quot;, published in &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 1932, he called the grid plan &quot;a straight-jacket from which [New York City] has not escaped, from which perhaps it can never escape.&quot;

Urban activist Jane Jacobs noted &quot;street[s] that go on and on ... dribbling into endless amorphous repetitions ... and finally petering into the utter anonymity of distances,&quot; and famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright wrote of its &quot;deadly monotony,&quot; calling it a &quot;man trap of gigantic dimensions.&quot;


As seen from the vilification in Moore&#x27;s and James&#x27; comments quoted above, the Commissioners came in for as much criticism as the grid itself. Mumford wrote that: &quot;With a T-square and a triangle, finally, the municipal engineer, without the slightest training as either an architect or a sociologist, could &quot;plan&quot; a metropolis...&quot; and Montgomery Schuyler, another architecture critic, claimed that &quot;We all agreedall of us, that is, who pay attention to such thingsthat the Commissioners were public malefactors of high degree.&quot; Jean Schopfer, writing in &quot;The Architectural Record&quot; in 1902, said of them &quot;Men of genius were needed ... Unhappily, they were ... men devoid of all imagination,&quot; while historian Thomas Janvier, in his book &quot;In Old New York&quot; (1894), wrote of the &quot;deplorable results&quot; of &quot;the excellently dull gentlemen&quot;, and criticized the plan as only &quot;a grind of money-making.&quot; He wrote about it that the Commissioners

decided that the forests should be cut away, the hills levelled , the hollows filled in, the streams buried; and upon the flat surface thus created they clamped down a ruler and completed their ... programme by creating a city in which all was right angles and straight lines.

Further,

Unfortunately, the promise of this far-sighted undertaking was far from being fulfilled in its performance. The magnificent opportunity which was given to the Commissioners to create a beautiful city simply was wasted and thrown away. ... Thinking only of utility and economy ... in the simplest and dullest way ... their Plan fell so far short of what might have been accomplished by men of genius governed by artistic taste. ... [T]hey were surcharged with the dullness and intense utilitarianism of the people and the period of which they were a part.

French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre wrote about New York City in both French and English. He learned to love the city, but also wrote that &quot;in this immense, malevolent space, in this desert of rock that brooks no vegetation&quot; he felt lost. &quot;Amid the numerical anonymity of streets and avenues, I am simply anyone, anywhere, since one place is so like another. I am never astray, but always lost.&quot; His one essay on New York in English, originally published in &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; in May 1946, was republished as &quot;New York, Colonial City,&quot; but the original title was &quot;Manhattan: The Great American Desert.&quot;

Modern urban analysts often have negative comments about the grid, from Vincent Scully&#x27;s calling it an &quot;implacable gridiron&quot; to the comment of Richard Pluz, an historian of housing, that &quot;Even in 1811, the gridiron did not work well.&quot; Urban planner Peter Marcuse wrote that it was &quot;generally taken to be one of the worst city plans of any major city in the developed countries of the world.&quot;

Urban historian John W. Reps, in his &quot;The Making of Urban America&quot; of 1965, wrote of the grid:

The unfortunate results of the prejudices and mistakes of the planners of 1811 are well known today. The lack of suitable sites for public buildings, the traffic congestion at the frequent intersections, the lack of enough north–south arteries, the overbuilding on narrow lots that inevitably resulted from the shallow blocksthese are but a few of the shortcomings. But even by the standards of the early nineteenth century the plan was inadequate. In an effort to escape criticism on the grounds of economy and practicality, the commissioners ignored well-known principles of civic design that would have brought variety in street vistas and resulted in focal points for sites for important buildings and use. True enough, no one would have foreseen the rapid growth of the city and the changes in transportation and population that lessened the importance of the river-to-river cross streets while placing an intolerable load on the less numerous north–south avenues. But one cannot avoid the conclusion that the commissioners, in fixing upon their plan, were motivated mainly by narrow consideration of economic gain. Their surveyor, Randel, was later to defend the plan by steadfastly maintaining its utility for the &quot;buying, selling and improving of real estate.&quot; As an aid to speculation the commissioners&#x27; plan was perhaps unequalled, but only on this ground can it justifiably be called a great achievement.

Reps also wrote that &quot;The fact that it was the gridiron New York that served as a model for later cities was a disaster whose consequences have barely been mitigated by more modern city planners.&quot;

In his book, &quot;City on a Grid: How New York Became New York&quot;, historian Gerard Koeppel says of the Commissioners&#x27; Plan that it was &quot;simply not something that had been deeply thought out,&quot; and quotes a student of the plan as saying that it was &quot;a quick solution to a difficult problem&quot; made by &quot;apathetic authors, who simply overlaid Manhattan with eight miles of uncompromising grid.&quot;

===Praise===
From its inception, there have been those who sang the praises of the Commissioners&#x27; gridiron plan. Writing in 1986, urban analyst David Schuyler said that &quot;In 1811 the gridiron had been so widely accepted as the optimal street arrangement for a commercial city that the plan received only perfunctory treatment in the presseven though it had a dramatic effect on existing property lines.&quot;

The &quot;Citizens and Strangers Guide&quot; of 1814 said &quot;The whole island has been surveyed and framed into extensive avenues and commodious streets, forming an important legacy to posterity, from which the most solid advantages may be anticipated,&quot; while another commentator from that year wrote &quot;The arrangement of the original or lower part of the city ... is essentially defective. Beauty order and convenience seem to have been little valued by our ancestors.&quot; This comment is especially interesting, considering that so many of the critics of the plan would cite its lack of beauty as a reason for their displeasure with it. One critic recently pointed out that the wide avenues attract retail and commercial use, among other benefits. In 1836, an official in the city government wrote that the Plan &quot;...laid out the highways on the island upon so magnificent a scale, and with so bold a hand, and with such prophetic views, in respect to the future growth and extension of the city, that it will form an everlasting monument to the stability and wisdom of the measure.&quot;

James Kent, the eminent jurist and legal scholar, called the plan &quot;brilliant&quot;, and wrote in 1896:

The map and plan of the Commissioners laid out the highways on the island upon so magnificent a scale, and with so bold a hand, and with such prophetic views, in respect of the future growth and extension of the city, that it will form an everlasting monument of the stability and wisdom of the measure.

The lawyer and noted diarist George Templeton Strong enthusiastically embraced the grid and its resulting growth, writing in his diary in 1850:

How this city marches northward! The progress of 1835 and 1836 was nothing to the luxuriant rank growth of this year. Streets are springing up, whole strata of sandstone have transferred themselves from their ancient resting places to look down on bustling thoroughfares for long years to come. Wealth is rushing in upon us like a freshet.

Architect Rem Koolhaas in his 1978 book &quot;Delirious New York&quot; comments that it created &quot;undreamed-of freedom for three-dimensional anarchy,&quot; and called it &quot;the most courageous act of prediction on Western civilization.&quot; Koolhaas celebrated the city&#x27;s &quot;poetic density&quot; and sees the architecture of Manhattan as &quot;a paradigm for the exploitation of congestion&quot;; indeed he applauds the city&#x27;s &quot;culture of congestion.&quot; Because of the &quot;magic carpet of the Grid&quot;, &quot;all blocks are the same, their equivalence invalidates, at once, all the systems of articulation and differentiation that have guided the design of traditional cities. ... [It] made the history of architecture and all previous lessons of urbanism irrelevant. It forces Manhattan&#x27;s builders to develop a new system of formal values, to invest strategies for the distinction of one block from another.&quot;

Modernist architect Le Corbusier gushed that &quot;I insist on right-angled intersections&quot;, while Wendy Evans Joseph, another architect, extolled the grid as &quot;embody[ing] something uniquely American, a democratic transparency, accessible and open to all ... a republican ideal, the synthesis of the rural order of the neatly laid out rows and furrows of the farm with the fiercely competitive, chaotic madness of the city.&quot;

Rafael Viñoly, a Uruguayan-born architect, called the grid &quot;the best manifestation of American pragmatism in the creation of urban form,&quot; writing:

It is the unified formula that controls and organizes the forces that make the city what it is, what it was, and what it will become ... In this compact schema that concentrates prescriptions of scale, density, and serviceability all in one, the play between public and private interests is in the inevitable balance that transcends speculation without restricting liberty. It is the mechanism that has allowed mediocrity to coexist with greatness in a cohesive whole. ... Manhattan ... doesn&#x27;t need architecture to be validated; it is the consequence of a free game in which the rules are clear and effective to produce it. ... I don&#x27;t believe this planning grid can be a model for other cities to emulate, nor do I think it can be repeated, but I do believe it is a lesson in consistency and realism ...

One man argued that it was wrong to expect New York City to be beautiful. Niels Gron, born in Denmark, but very familiar with New York, said in 1900:

Before I came to this country, and in all the time I have been here, it has never occurred to me to think of New York as being beautiful. Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful in the same way as the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.

Journalist James Traub wrote that &quot;Manhattan is a remorseless place to which its citizens are peculiarly adapted. and of which out-of-towners seem unaccountably fond. It was designed that way. ... I would never say that what I love about New York is its &quot;utility,&quot; but I would say that the utilitarian street plan has made possible the helter-skelter, pell-mell life of the citywhich is what I do love.&quot;

In 2013, Hilary Ballon, the curator of &quot;The Greatest Grid: The Master Plan of Manhattan 1811–2011&quot;, an exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York, wrote about the Commissioners&#x27; Plan:

[I]n our fast changing world where technology is outdated in a blink and future-proofing is the gold standard, the grid has demonstrated remarkable flexibility. Over two hundred years, the scale of architecture has changed from three-story walk-ups to skyscrapers more than 1,000 feet tall. Parks and avenues unanticipated by the plan have been created. The grid gave rise to a particular kind of urbanism. Unlike Washington, D.C., and the capital cities of Europe, New York does not have axial avenues that focus on star buildings. New York has buildings that sit cheek by jowl and anonymously form street walls. It has narrow canyons of space bounded by those street walls with views of the horizon. It has density and enclosure but also the thrill of open-ended space. Yet when modernist urban theories turned against the vernacular urbanism of New York, and superblocks and towers in the park were imposed on the city, the grid absorbed those inventions. Although New York&#x27;s real estate dynamism is typically associated with disrespect for history, with buildings toppled for the next generation of taller ones, the 1811 grid endures as living history. The plan leaves its imprint on every block, lot, and building in Manhattan, and has provided a remarkably flexible framework for growth and change.

Ballon continues:

To early visitors, the grid was disorienting: the streets looked alike and offered no landmarks or mnemonic devices to distinguish one from the other. However, as New York matured and the grid was inflected by different neighborhoods, the disorientation of the grid lapsed. Amid the city&#x27;s plenitude and infinite variety, the grid and its number address system provided an orienting framework. It requires no insider knowledge to find an address; visitors can easily navigate, except where the city is off the grid. New York&#x27;s street system creates such transparency and accessibility that the grid serves as metaphor for the openness of New York itself!

Journalist and author David Owen wrote in his book &quot;Green Metropolis&quot; (2009) that &quot;Gridlike street plans may seem unimaginative, but they increase the mobility of pedestrians and are almost always self-explanatory; walking in much of Manhattan, even in areas where the distances between avenues is great, is like walking on a map.&quot; Similarly, economist Edward Glaeser, author of &quot;Triumph of the City&quot; (2011), wrote that &quot;Manhattan&#x27;s grid imposes clarity on the island&#x27;s burbling chaos and enables ordinary pedestrians to negotiate New York&#x27;s complex ecosystem. While many city plans are more beautiful in the abstract, none has done more to facilitate the magnificent energy of the flowing human city. The grid makes manageable the messy humanity of millions. ... It may not be every urban planner&#x27;s &quot;beau ideal&quot;, but as a machine for urban living, the grid is pretty perfect.&quot;

In &quot;The Shape of Green&quot;, architect Lance Hosey writes that the grid is well-adapted to its natural setting:

The plan of Manhattan is smarter than conventional wisdom concedes. Not a square grid, most of the streets run river to river instead of uptown and down, partly because the planners assumed that maritime commerce along the riverfronts would create more crosstown traffic. The blocks are nearly five times longer in the east–west dimension (avenue to avenue) than in the north–south (street to street), so most buildings avoid the low morning and afternoon sun, thereby ensuring plenty of light without too much heat. Because the grid sits at a twenty-nine-degree angle off of true north, potentially every building on every street can receive direct daylight every day of the year.

Finally, Roland Barthes, the French literary theorist, philosopher, linguist, critic, and semiotician, wrote in 1959: &quot;This is the purpose of New York&#x27;s geometry: that each individual should be &quot;poetically&quot; the owner of the capital of the world.&quot;

<text>The Cape Barren goose (Cereopsis novaehollandiae), sometimes also known as the pig goose, is a species of goose endemic to southern Australia. It is a distinctive large, grey bird that is mostly terrestrial and is not closely related to other extant members of the subfamily Anserinae.

==Taxonomy and history==
The indigenous Jardwadjali people of western Victoria refer to this species as &quot;toolka&quot;.

The Cape Barren goose was first formally described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as &quot;Cereopsis N. Hollandiae&quot;. The species had been earlier reported from the Bass Strait by George Bass and Matthew Flinders in 1798, who referred to it as a &quot;Brent or Barnacle Goose&quot;.

The taxonomic placement of this species is not yet fully resolved. It is now generally recognised as being a member of the subfamily Anserinae, however, it has also been associated with Tadorninae. When placed within Anserinae it may be considered a member of the tribe Anserini (alongside &quot;Anser&quot; and &quot;Branta&quot;) or placed in its own tribe, Cereopsini.

Two subspecies of Cape Barren goose are currently recognised:

*&quot;Cereopsis novaehollandiae novaehollandiae&quot; – south-eastern Australia (southern Victoria, eastern South Australia, Tasmania, and Bass Strait islands)
*&quot;Cereopsis novaehollandiae grisea&quot; – south-western Australia (Recherche Archipelago and adjacent coast of mainland Western Australia)

==Description==
Adult Cape Barren geese are large birds, typically measuring long and weighing between , with males generally being larger than females. The plumage is mostly pale grey with a slight brown tint. The head is somewhat small in proportion to the body and mostly grey in colour, save for a pale whitish patch on the forehead and crown. The bill is short, measuring in length, triangular in shape and black in colour with a prominent pale yellow-green cere covering more than half the length of the bill. Feathers on the breast and back have pale margins, while the upperwing coverts and scapular feathers each have a brownish grey spot near the tip. The flight feathers are grey with black tips, with the black extending to cover the distal half of the outer primaries, giving the appearance of a dark trailing edge to the wings when in flight. The tail feathers are black, and the legs are pink with black feet.

Newly-hatched goslings are white with broad, dark stripes and a dark cere. Older juveniles are a paler grey with heavier spotting on the wings and scapular feathers than adults. The cere turns a light yellow-green colour at around 70 days old, with juveniles molting into adult plumage at around 6 months old.
==Behaviour==
Cape Barren geese are largely terrestrial, only occasionally swimming. They predominantly graze on grasses, sedges, legumes, herbs, and succulents. Their diet may include plants such as &quot;Poa poiformis&quot;, &quot;Disphyma australe&quot;, &quot;Myoporum insulare&quot;, and species of &quot;Trifolium&quot; and &quot;Juncus&quot;.

Males can produce a rapid, high-pitched honking call, often during takeoff or in flight. Both sexes make low, pig-like grunting sounds and hisses when alarmed. Goslings produce whistling distress calls.

Cape Barren geese are monogamous and typically mate for life. After mating, the pair will perform a ‘triumph ceremony’ in which they raise and lower their heads while facing each other and calling loudly. Pairs establish territories in autumn and breeding occurs in winter.

Pairs may nest singly or in loose colonies. The nest is a shallow hollow lined with vegetation and down, usually constructed amongst tussock grass, rocks, or bushes. The nest is mainly constructed by the male but lined by the female. The female typically lays 4-5 creamy white eggs at 1-3 day intervals. The eggs are incubated only by the female over a period of 34–37 days. Both parents care for the young once hatched.

Cape Barren geese are capable of drinking salt and brackish water, which allows them to remain on offshore islands year-round.

==Range and habitat==
A previous decline in numbers appears to have been reversed as birds in the east at least have adapted to feeding on agricultural land. The breeding areas are grassy islands off the Australian coast, where this species nests on the ground. Breeding pairs are strongly territorial. It bears captivity well, quite readily breeding in confinement if large enough paddocks are provided.

In Australia, 19th-century explorers named a number of islands &quot;Goose Island&quot; due to the species&#x27; presence there.

A few geese were introduced near Christchurch, New Zealand, where the population persists.

In 1968, a small number of geese were introduced to Maria Island.

<text>The Bolshoi Ballet is an internationally renowned classical ballet company based at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia. Founded in 1776, the Bolshoi is among the world&#x27;s oldest ballet companies. In the early 20th century, it came to international prominence as Moscow became the capital of Soviet Russia. The Bolshoi has been recognised as one of the foremost ballet companies in the world. It has a branch at the Bolshoi Ballet Theater School in Joinville, Brazil.

==History==
The earliest iteration of the Bolshoi Ballet can be found in the creation of a dance school for a Moscow orphanage in 1773. In 1776, dancers from the school were employed by Prince Pyotr Vasilyevich Urusov and English theatrical entrepreneur Michael Maddox to form part of their new theatre company. Originally performing in privately owned venues, they later acquired the Petrovsky Theatre, which, as a result of fires and erratic redevelopment, would later be rebuilt as today&#x27;s Bolshoi Theatre. While some guest dancers come and go from other prestigious ballet companies, such as Mariinsky and American Ballet Theatre, most company dancers are graduates of the academy. In 1989, Michael Shannon was the first American ballet dancer to graduate from the Bolshoi Ballet Academy and join the Bolshoi Ballet company.

Despite staging many famous ballets, it struggled to compete with the reputation of the Imperial Russian Ballet, today&#x27;s Mariinsky Ballet of St. Petersburg. It was not until the appointment of Alexander Gorsky as Ballet Master in 1900 that the company began to develop its own unique identity, with acclaimed productions of new or restaged ballets including &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1900), &quot;Coppélia&quot; (1901), &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (1901), &quot;La fille mal gardée&quot; (1903), &quot;Giselle&quot; (1911), &quot;Le Corsaire&quot; (1912) and &quot;La Bayadère&quot; (1917).

The Soviet leadership&#x27;s preference for uncomplicated moral themes in the arts was demonstrated in Yuri Grigorovich&#x27;s appointment as director in 1964. Grigorovich held his position until 1995, at which point a series of directors, including Boris Akimov, Alexei Ratmansky, Yuri Burlaka and Sergei Filin, brought more modern dance performance ideas to the company.

==Company structure==
Today the Bolshoi Ballet remains one of the world&#x27;s foremost ballet companies, in addition to being one of the largest, with approximately 220 dancers. The word &quot;bolshoi&quot; means &quot;big&quot; or &quot;grand&quot; in Russian. The company operates on a hierarchical system, similar to those used by other leading European ballet companies, with senior dancers ranked as principals, and descending in order of importance through lead soloist, first soloist, soloist and finally, corps de ballet. Due to its size, the company operates two troupes of corps de ballet.

In 2000, the Bolshoi Ballet opened its first Ballet Academy outside Russia, in Joinville, Brazil.

==Performance style==
The performance style of the Bolshoi Ballet is typically identified as being colourful and bold, combining technique and athleticism with expressiveness and dramatic intensity. This style is commonly attributed to Alexander Gorsky. Historically there has been a fierce rivalry with the St. Petersburg Heritage Ballet Company, the Mariinsky. Both have developed very different performing styles: the Bolshoi has a more colourful and bold approach, whereas the Mariinsky is associated with more pure and refined classicism.

===Corps de ballet===
The Bolshoi Ballet operates two troupes of corps de ballet, with approximately 169 dancers in total.

==Controversies==
In 2013, ballerina Anastasia Volochkova claimed that female dancers were forced to sleep with wealthy patrons, saying: &quot;It mainly happened with the corps du [sic] ballet but also with the soloists. [...] I repeatedly received such propositions to share the beds of oligarchs.&quot; American dancer Joy Womack echoed this concern when she left the company after being told that, to secure solo roles, she must either pay $10,000 or &quot;start a relationship with a sponsor.&quot;

In January 2013, a sulfuric acid attack on art director Sergei Filin once again steeped the company in scandal. Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko was convicted of organizing the attack and was sentenced to six years in prison. Reasons for the attack include corruption within the company.

In 2014, 25-year-old ballet dancer Olga Demina mysteriously went missing. In September 2020, Russian investigators announced that they believe Demina may have been killed in a blackmail plot by Malkhaz Dzhavoev, whom she was dating and was allegedly her &quot;manager&quot;.

In July 2017, the Bolshoi Theatre cancelled the premiere of a ballet about openly gay Soviet dancer Rudolf Nureyev. The Director General claimed that it was due to poor dancing quality; however, principal dancer Maria Alexandrova claimed it was the first sign of a &#x27;new era&#x27; of censorship. It was the first time a show has been pulled in such a way since the collapse of the Soviet Union, sparking rumours about the motivation behind the move.

<text>Paul Harvey Aurandt (September 4, 1918 – February 28, 2009) was an American radio broadcaster for ABC News Radio. He broadcast &quot;News and Comment&quot; on mornings and mid-days on weekdays and at noon on Saturdays and also his famous &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot; segments. From 1951 to 2008, his programs reached as many as 24 million people per week. &quot;Paul Harvey News&quot; was carried on 1,200 radio stations, on 400 American Forces Network stations, and in 300 newspapers.

==Early life==
Harvey was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and was the son of a policeman who was killed by robbers in 1921. He made radio receivers as a young boy, and attended Tulsa Central High School, where he was two years ahead of future actor Tony Randall. Teacher Isabelle Ronan was &quot;impressed by his voice&quot;. On her recommendation, he started working at KVOO in Tulsa in 1933 helping to clean up when he was 14. He eventually was allowed to fill in on the air by reading commercials and the news.

He continued working at KVOO while he attended the University of Tulsa, first as an announcer and later as a program director. He spent three years as a station manager for KFBI AM (later KFDI), a Wichita, KS radio station that once had studios in Salina, Kansas. From there, he moved to a newscasting job at KOMA in Oklahoma City, and then to KXOK in St. Louis in 1938 where he was Director of Special Events and a roving reporter.

==Career==
===World War II===
Harvey then moved to Hawaii to cover the U.S. Navy as it concentrated its fleet in the Pacific after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He eventually enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces but only served from December 1943 to March 1944 resulting from a medical discharge. He then moved to Chicago, where in June 1944, he began broadcasting from the ABC affiliate WENR.

===Career in Chicago===
In 1945, he began hosting the postwar employment program &quot;Jobs for G.I. Joe&quot; on WENR. Harvey added &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot; as a tagline to in-depth feature stories in 1946. One of Harvey&#x27;s regular topics was lax security, particularly at Argonne National Laboratory, a nuclear research facility southwest of Chicago. To demonstrate his concern, just after midnight on February 6, 1951, he entered the grounds by scaling a fence and was quickly apprehended by security guards. In 2010, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, having obtained 1400 pages of the FBI file on Harvey, described it as an &quot;act of participatory journalism.&quot; Harvey&#x27;s &quot;escapade&quot; prompted the U.S. attorney for Illinois to empanel a grand jury to consider an espionage indictment. Harvey &quot;went on the air to suggest he was being set up,&quot; and the grand jury subsequently declined to indict Harvey.

===Going national===
Harvey had done sporadic work from Chicago for ABC Radio in the late 1940s and early 1950s and had just completed two weeks as the guest host for veteran commentator H. R. Baukhage on his daily 11 AM news round-up. When Baukhage returned from his early spring vacation, ABC dismissed him, and put Harvey on in his place. On April 1, 1951, the ABC Radio Network debuted &quot;Paul Harvey News and Comment&quot;, with a noon time slot on weekdays. His network television debut came on November 16, 1952, when he began a 15-minute newscast on ABC. The program originated at WENR-TV in Chicago.

Later Harvey began to host a separate program, &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot;, in which he provided backstories behind famous people and events. &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot; premiered on May 10, 1976, on ABC Radio. The series quickly grew to six broadcasts a week and continued until his death in 2009. It was written and produced by his son, Paul Harvey, Jr., from its outset and for its 33-year duration. Harvey and his radio network stated that the stories in that series, although entertaining, were completely true. That was contested by some critics, including urban legend expert Jan Harold Brunvand.

In November 2000, Harvey signed a 10-year $100 million contract with ABC Radio Networks. A few months later, after damaging his vocal cords, he went off the air, but returned in August 2001.

His success with sponsors stemmed from the seamlessness with which he segued from his monologue into reading commercial messages. He explained his relationship with them: &quot;I am fiercely loyal to those willing to put their money where my mouth is.&quot;

===Fill-in hosts===
Former US Senator Fred Thompson substituted for Harvey regularly from 2006 to 2007. Other substitutes for Harvey included his son, Paul Harvey Jr., Paul W. Smith, Gil Gross, Ron Chapman, Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, Mort Crim, Scott Shannon, Joe Holstead, and Tony Snow. Three weeks after Harvey&#x27;s death, the &quot;News and Comment&quot; franchise was canceled.

Harvey did not host the show full-time after April 2008, when he came down with pneumonia. Shortly after his recovery, his wife died on May 3, which caused him to prolong his time away from broadcasting. He voiced commercials and new episodes of &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot; and &quot;News &amp; Comment&quot; during middays a few times a week, with his son handling mornings.

===Aviation===
Harvey was an avid pilot who served in the U.S. Army Air Corps from December 1943 to March 1944. He was an Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) member for more than 50 years and would occasionally talk about flying to his radio audience. He was also a member of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) and was frequently seen at EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He was responsible for funding the Paul Harvey Audio-Video Center at EAA&#x27;s headquarters in Oshkosh. Harvey was also an early investor in aircraft manufacturing company Cirrus Aircraft, based in Duluth, Minnesota. According to the &quot;AOPA Pilot&quot; contributing editor Barry Schiff, Harvey coined the term &quot;skyjack&quot;.

==On-air persona==
Harvey&#x27;s on-air persona was influenced by sportscaster Bill Stern and columnist Walter Winchell. In the 1940s, Stern&#x27;s &quot;The Colgate Sports Reel&quot; and newsreel programs used many of the techniques later used by Harvey, including his emphatic style of delivery and the use of phrases such as &quot;Reel Two&quot; and &quot;Reel Three&quot; to denote segments of the broadcast, much like Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Page Two&quot; and &quot;Page Three&quot;. 

Harvey was also known for the catchphrases that he used at the beginning of his programs, such as &quot;Hello Americans, this is Paul Harvey. Stand by for NEWS!&quot; He always ended, &quot;Paul Harvey... Good &quot;day&quot;.&quot; or &quot;Paul Harvey... Good &quot;night&quot;.&quot; A story might be &quot;This day&#x27;s news of most lasting significance.&quot; At the end of a report about someone who had done something ridiculous or offensive, Harvey would say, &quot;He would want us to mention his name,&quot; followed by silence, and he would then start the next item. The last item of a broadcast, which was often a funny story, would usually be preceded by &quot;And now from the &#x27;For-what-it&#x27;s-worth&#x27; department...&quot;

Other phrases made famous by Harvey included &quot;Here&#x27;s a strange...&quot; (a story with an unusual twist) and &quot;Self-government won&#x27;t work without self-discipline.&quot; He also is credited with popularizing the terms &quot;Reaganomics&quot; and &quot;guesstimate&quot;.

In addition to the inquiry into whether Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Rest of the Story&quot; tales are true, Harvey&#x27;s trademark ability of seamlessly migrating from content to commercial brought scrutiny. In that context, &quot;Salon&quot; magazine called him the &quot;finest huckster ever to roam the airwaves.&quot; Some have argued that Harvey&#x27;s fawning and lavish product endorsements may have been misleading or confusing to his audience. Harvey&#x27;s endorsed products included EdenPure heaters, Bose radios, Select Comfort mattresses, and Hi-Health dietary supplements, including a supplement that was claimed to improve vision but was later the subject of a Federal Trade Commission enforcement action against the manufacturer (but not Harvey himself) for misleading claims made on his show. In one of the tribute broadcasts, Gil Gross said that Harvey considered advertising just another type of news and that he endorsed only products that he believed in, often by interviewing someone from the company.

Harvey is caricatured in multiple episodes of &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;, voiced by Paul Rugg. He is used as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to wrap the plot up by describing its ending, or to give backstories for villains. He also occasionally references his catchphrases of &quot;Good day!&quot; and &quot;Now you know the rest of the story&quot;.

==Personal views==
Beginning in 1952, Harvey was a friend of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Harvey would often submit &quot;advance copies of his radio script for comment and approval.&quot; Harvey&#x27;s friendship with Hoover may have helped him escape criminal charges relating to his trespassing at Argonne National Laboratory. Harvey was happy to defend Hoover and spoke of him on his show of April 25, 1963: &quot;God help the United States without John Edgar Hoover... (FBI) Director Hoover is not retiring. If you have heard otherwise, somebody&#x27;s sinister wish was the father of that thought. It is not so.&quot;

Harvey was also a close friend of US Senator Joseph McCarthy and supported his campaign to expose and expel communists from American society and government.

Harvey was also a close friend of George Vandeman and the Reverend Billy Graham. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, Harvey attended Calvary Memorial Church in Oak Park. When the church moved from its original location on Madison Street to the former Presbyterian Church on Lake Street, Harvey asked Graham to preach at the dedication service. Harvey associated with various congregations of different denominations. He and his wife regularly attended the Camelback Adventist Church in Scottsdale, Arizona, during his winters there. He often quoted the Adventist pioneer Ellen G. White in his broadcasts and received the &quot;Golden Microphone&quot; Award for his professionalism and graciousness in dealing with the church. He was also active with a small Plymouth Brethren meeting in Maywood, Illinois, called Woodside Bible Chapel.

==Rhetorical style==
Robert D. McFadden, writing Harvey&#x27;s obituary for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, examined his unique radio style and how it interacted with his political views:

[He] personalized the radio news with his right wing opinions, but laced them with his own trademarks: a hypnotic timbre, extended pauses for effect, heart-warming tales of average Americans and folksy observations that evoked the heartland, family values and the old-fashioned plain talk one heard around the dinner table on Sunday.

&quot;Hello, Americans,&quot; he barked. &quot;This is Paul Harvey! Stand byyy for newwws!&quot;

He railed against welfare cheats and defended the death penalty. He worried about the national debt, big government, bureaucrats who lacked common sense, permissive parents, leftist radicals and America succumbing to moral decay. He championed rugged individualism, love of God and country, and the fundamental decency of ordinary people.

==Awards==
Harvey was elected to the National Association of Broadcasters National Radio Hall of Fame and Oklahoma Hall of Fame, and appeared on the Gallup poll list of America&#x27;s most admired men. In addition he received 11 Freedom Foundation Awards as well as the Horatio Alger Award. Harvey was named to the DeMolay Hall of Fame, a Masonic youth organization, on June 25, 1993.

In 2005, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States&#x27; most prestigious civilian award, by President George W. Bush. Bush&#x27;s remarks summarized Harvey&#x27;s career: &quot;He first went on the air in 1933, and he&#x27;s been heard nationwide for 54 years. Americans like the sound of his voice...over the decades we have come to recognize in that voice some of the finest qualities of our country: patriotism, the good humor, the kindness, and common sense of Americans.&quot;

On May 18, 2007, he received an honorary degree from Washington University in St. Louis.

In 1992 he received the Paul White Award of the Radio Television Digital News Association

Paul Harvey was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1987 in the area of Communication.

==Family==
Harvey was born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the son of Harry Harrison Aurandt (1873–1921) and Anna Dagmar (née Christensen) Aurandt (1883–1960). His father was born in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania; his mother was Danish. He had one sibling, an older sister Frances Harrietta (née Aurandt) Price (1908–1988).

In December 1921, when Harvey was three years old, his father was murdered. The elder Aurandt was a Tulsa policeman who served as secretary to Commissioner J.H. Adkinson. On the night of December 18, Officer Aurandt and a friend, Tulsa police detective Ike Wilkerson, were off-duty and rabbit hunting when they were approached by four masked and armed men who attempted to rob them. Mr. Aurandt was shot and died two days later of his wounds. A large-scale manhunt resulted in the arrest of four suspects the day after Aurandt died. A lynch mob of 1,000 people formed at the jail, but the suspects were smuggled out. Two of them would be convicted of murder and sentenced to life terms following identification by Detective Wilkerson, who said that he knew the men and was able to recognize them despite their masks. At Aurandt&#x27;s funeral, twelve robed members of the Ku Klux Klan arrived late in the service and dropped roses on his casket, though there is no other indication that Aurandt was himself a Klansman.

In 1940, Harvey married Lynne Cooper of St. Louis. She was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa at Washington University in St. Louis and a former schoolteacher. They met when Harvey was working at KXOK and Cooper came to the station for a school news program. Harvey invited her to dinner, proposed to her after a few minutes of conversation and from then on called her &quot;Angel,&quot; even on his radio show. A year later she said yes. The couple moved to Chicago in 1944.

On May 17, 2007, Harvey told his radio audience that Angel had developed leukemia. Her death, at the age of 92, was announced by ABC radio on May 3, 2008. When she died at their River Forest home, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described her as, &quot;More than his astute business partner and producer, she also was a pioneer for women in radio and an influential figure in her own right for decades.&quot; According to the founder of the Museum of Broadcast Communications, Bruce DuMont, &quot;She was to Paul Harvey what Colonel Parker was to Elvis Presley. She really put him on track to have the phenomenal career that his career has been.&quot;

Lynne Harvey was the first producer inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame, and had developed some of her husband&#x27;s best-known features, such as &quot;The Rest of the Story.&quot; While working on her husband&#x27;s radio show, she established 10 p.m. as the hour in which news is broadcast. She was the first woman to receive a lifetime achievement award from the Chicago chapter of American Women in Radio and Television. She worked in television also, and created a television show called &quot;Dilemma&quot; which is acknowledged as the prototype of the modern talk show genre. While working at CBS, she was among the first women to produce an entire newscast. In later years, she was best known as a philanthropist.

They had one son, Paul Aurandt Jr., who goes by the name Paul Harvey Jr. He assisted his father at &quot;News and Comment&quot; and &quot;The Rest of the Story.&quot; Paul, Jr., whose voice announced the bumpers between episodes, filled in for his father during broadcasts and broadcast the morning editions after the passing of his mother.

==Death and tributes==
Harvey died on February 28, 2009, at age 90 at a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, surrounded by family and friends. No cause of death was announced. In response to his father&#x27;s death, his son, Paul Harvey Jr., said, &quot;Millions have lost a friend&quot;. At the time of his death, he had less than two years left on his ten-year contract. Former President George W. Bush issued a statement on Harvey&#x27;s death, calling him &quot;a friendly and familiar voice in the lives of millions of Americans.&quot;

On March 4, Gil Gross was chosen to become the next host of &quot;News &amp; Comment&quot;. Gross lasted only one week before being taken off the air; Gross, who was based in San Francisco, would have had to record the show around 1:00 a.m. Pacific Time to finish in time for the East Coast broadcasts, in addition to his local show on KGO. &quot;News &amp; Comment&quot; was replaced the next week by Mike Huckabee&#x27;s existing commentary, &quot;The Huckabee Report&quot;. &quot;The Huckabee Report&quot; ceased radio distribution in 2015.

Harvey&#x27;s full-length biography, &quot;Good Day! The Paul Harvey Story,&quot; was published in May 2009 by Regnery Publishing.

On February 3, 2013, a recording of Harvey&#x27;s &quot;So God Made a Farmer&quot; commentary was used by Ram Trucks in a commercial titled &quot;Farmer,&quot; which aired during Super Bowl XLVII.

<text>The Clutha River (, officially gazetted as Clutha River /) is the second longest river in New Zealand and the longest in the South Island. It flows south-southeast through Central and South Otago from Lake Wānaka in the Southern Alps to the Pacific Ocean, south west of Dunedin. Gold is in abundance in the Clutha River and its surrounding areas. It is the highest volume river in New Zealand, and has a discharging mean flow of .

The Clutha River played a prominent role in both the Māori and European history of the area. Rivers and valleys were the main transport system used by local Māori to access the interior of the South Island. The 1860s Otago gold rush resulted in the production of approximately 240 tonnes of gold, which was found in the Clutha catchment. It has the biggest catchment and outflow in New Zealand. About 6% of all water in the South Island is discharged by the Clutha River alone. It has a mean discharge of approximately and a catchment area of around and is an economically significant river for the country. The Clutha River encompasses two hydropower stations, which provide 14% of the country&#x27;s hydropower generation capacity.

The Clutha River drains the high mountains of the Southern Alps in the west and passes through a complex topographic system of basins and ranges towards the east before reaching into the Pacific Ocean. A majority of the topographical features of the Clutha River catchment area are a direct result of the late Cenozoic and active tectonic processes that are occurring in southern South Island due to deformation along the nearby plate boundary, defined by the Alpine Fault.

The river is known for its scenery, gold-rush history, and swift turquoise waters. A river conservation group, the Clutha Mata-Au River Parkway Group, is working to establish a regional river parkway, with a trail, along the entire river corridor.

== Toponomy ==
The Māori name for the Clutha River is the Mata-Au (sometimes shortened to Matau), meaning &#x27;surface current&#x27;. Early settlers sometimes spelled the Māori name as &quot;Matou&quot; and &quot;Matua-a&quot;, and pronounced it &quot;Mattoo&quot;. Māori also referred to the Clutha River as &quot;Maranuku&quot;.

The first appearance of a European name for the Clutha River / Mata-Au was the Molyneux River (); its mouth was named by Captain James Cook after his sailing master, Robert Molineux. The name is also applied to the small settlement of Port Molyneux. Early maps show Moulineux Harbour in its original spelling, but later maps indicate the harbour&#x27;s name was written as &quot;Molyneux&quot;, rather than &quot;Moulineux&quot;.

The river is now commonly known as the Clutha, which comes from &quot;Cluaidh&quot;, the Scots Gaelic name for the River Clyde in Scotland, which runs through Glasgow.

The official name for the river has been Clutha River / Mata-au since the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, a landmark Treaty of Waitangi settlement, which added dual names to approximately 90 geographic features throughout the South Island to recognise the &quot;equal and special significance&quot; of both the English and Māori names.

==History==
===Māori history===
Māori occupation of the Otago Region began in . Māori learned to hunt the numerous species of moa and burned many of the inland forests. The first iwi in Otago were Waitaha, then Kāti Māmoe; later came Kāi Tahu. By the end of the fourteenth century, the environment in Otago and Southland (Murihuku) had begun to shift, with podocarp woods retreating and the moa population declining. A few Māori settlements in the region started to lose importance, although several settlements still existed in Central Otago. Several locations along the Clutha River retain the names of Kāti Māmoe chiefs, such as, &quot;Taumata-o-Te-Hau&quot;, a hill on the north side of the Clutha River, above Balclutha, named after the chief who climbed there and watched for the arrival of a &quot;taua&quot; for whom he had prepared a trap. Historically, Kāi Tahu travelled upstream the Clutha River to fish for eels and hunt waterfowl. Kāi Tahu used to travel in to the interior of the South Island almost every year and had campsites and burial sites along the Clutha River and its nearby lakes.

The mouth of Mata-au was heavily populated, with many permanent and temporary Kāi Tahu settlements throughout the lower stretches of the river. Murikauhaka, a settlement near the mouth of the Mata-au, was at one stage home to an estimated two hundred people. Māori trading groups used the Cromwell Gorge as the main thoroughfare to their pounamu and moa-hunting expeditions to the interior of Otago.

Many early Māori archaeological sites have been found in the Cromwell Gorge, featuring moa eggshell fragments. Unlike other Central Otago sites, no burned bones have been found.

===European history===
During early European settlement in the South Island, a whaling station was established close to the Clutha River&#x27;s mouth at Port Molyneux, and during this period the sea was the source of almost all of the area&#x27;s economy. The town of Port Molyneux, located on this bay, was a busy harbour during the 19th century. Its location at the mouth of the Clutha made it a good site for trade, both from the interior and for coastal and ocean-going shipping. A major flood in 1878 shifted the mouth of the Clutha to the north and silted up the port, after which the town gradually dwindled.

The first European to visit the Upper Clutha area and to see the inland lakes of Wakatipu, Wānaka and Hāwea was Nathanael Chalmers, who was guided by Chiefs Reko and Kaikōura in 1853. They returned him down the river on a , a flax reed open kayak, that they built from flax stems and raupō from the shores of Lake Hāwea.
In 1910, 57 years after the event, Nathanael Chalmers remembered his boat trip through the Cromwell Gorge: &quot;I shall never forget the &quot;race&quot; through the gorge ... my heart was literally in my mouth, but those two old men seemed to care nothing for the current.&quot;

European &quot;sheepmen&quot; arrived later in the late 1850s, searching for grazing grounds in Otago&#x27;s interior. Alexander and Watson Shennan set off from Milton (known previously as Tokomairiro) in December 1857 to Central Otago, looking for land to raise sheep. The brothers proceeded farther than the runholders who had previously acquired territory up to the Waitāhuna River. When they returned to Dunedin after spending several days exploring the Manuherikia Valley, they submitted an application to the Otago Provincial Government to lease two blocks of land on either side of the Manuherikia River. The total land area was . They brought sheep to the district in 1858. Watson Shennan described the area as &quot;well grassed and watered, a very land of promise&quot; which attracted others to the region.

In 1862, gold-rich bars of rocks and gravel were discovered by Christopher Reilly and Horatio Hartley during their winter 1862 expedition up Cromwell Gorge through the waters of the Clutha. They arrived in Dunedin on 15 August, 1862, deposited their of gold, and were rewarded with £2,000.

===Gold rush===
A gold rush began in Central Otago in the 1860s. With several settlements quickly established along gold-rich rivers such as the Clutha and Kawarau, the rush to Central Otago was the largest in the region&#x27;s history. A large number of miners&#x27; huts also existed during this era along the Clutha River. Roxburgh Gorge had a majority of the huts of this type, but they also occurred in Cromwell Gorge. A 1980 archaeological survey in the Roxburgh Gorge indicated a number of 32 huts and 79 rock shelters present in the area.

Around 100 dredges have operated at various times during the area&#x27;s history in the river bed and nearby gravels, including the present-day gorge to the east of the Old Man Range. The Clutha River and its tributary Kawarau transported alluvial gold across a distance of in river bed load. A Middle Pleistocene-age ancestral Clutha River delivered detrital gold across the lower parts of what is presently the Manuherikia Valley near Alexandra.

By Christmas 1861, 14,000 prospectors were on the Tuapeka and Waipori fields. The gold rush was short-lived, with most of the alluvial gold played out by 1863, but prospectors continued to arrive, swelling to a maximum of 18,000 miners in February 1864.

Mining in the Clutha River upstream from Cromwell became significant after 1900, when the area&#x27;s potential was gradually recognised. Previously, the Kawarau River and the Clutha River running downstream from Cromwell were the primary focus. Māori were aware of gold in the Clutha River but they did not value it.

==Geography==

The Clutha River is the South Island&#x27;s largest river and has the largest catchment and outflow in New Zealand. About 6% of all water in the South Island is discharged through Clutha River alone. It has a mean discharge of approximately , a catchment area of around , and a length of about , which makes it one of the longest rivers in New Zealand. The major tributaries include the Arrow River, Cardrona River, Lindis River, Manuherikia River, Teviot River, Pomahaka River, and the Waitāhuna River. Towns near the Clutha River include Alexandra, New Zealand, Balclutha, Cromwell, Roxbrugh, and Wānaka.

===Course===
The Clutha River extends about , flowing roughly north to south through the Otago Region. The Clutha River&#x27;s headwaters are located in the Southern Alps, receiving up to of precipitation annually from the west and north west. The Clutha River and its tributaries receive water from three lakes in Otago, Hāwea, Wakatipu, and Wānaka, along with its minor tributaries Arrow, Beaumont, Lindis, Manuherikia, Nevis, Shotover, Talla Burn, Teviot, and Pomahaka. The Clutha River may have taken its current course due to glacial advances in the middle to late-Pleistocene, advances that nearly reached Cromwell. It is an economically significant river for the country. The Clutha River encompasses two hydropower stations, which provide 14% of the country&#x27;s hydropower generation capacity.

===Catchment===
It drains the largest catchment in New Zealand, which is about in size, and has an area normalised flow of about . It has an average annual discharge of . Due to long-standing hydroelectricity commitments and increasing demands for urban water supply and irrigation for horticulture and agriculture, meeting the Clutha Catchment&#x27;s rapidly expanding water needs will become more challenging in the future. Located at a maximum elevation of approximately on the Main Divide of the Southern Alps, the majority of the river&#x27;s headwater flows originate from the melting of alpine snow cover and rainfall, with glaciers contributing a minor amount.

In inland basins, annual precipitation totals can be less than , while on the western edge of the catchment, they can surpass . The contribution of snowmelt to the annual streamflow of the Clutha River is estimated to be 10% by the time it reaches the Southern Pacific Ocean. This proportion is considerably higher for alpine sub-catchments and large inland basins, rising as high as 30% to 50%. A number of large tributaries originate in Central Otago&#x27;s semi-arid basins, where yearly precipitation can be as low as , which is an order of magnitude lower than on the Main Divide.

The mean flow of the Clutha is around , comparable to many much larger rivers. This heavy flow, combined with the relatively small size of the river in global terms, makes the Clutha notoriously fast-flowing. It is often listed as one of the world&#x27;s most swiftly flowing rivers, alongside Australia&#x27;s Macleay and Fitzroy Rivers, the Amazon and Atrato Rivers in South America, and the Teesta River in the Himalayas. The highest recorded flow on the Clutha was during heavy storms in 1978, peaking at .

==Ecology==

A 2022 report of the river by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) indicated a result of 12 species of native fish, and 2 species from its tributaries, with the exception of upland bully, common river galaxias and roundhead galaxias. All native species are diadromous, meaning that they are recorded from the tributaries, and giant kōkopu and kōaro likely went through the mainstem while on their way to its tributaries. The Clutha River has a limited
collection of native species, though it does provide a through route for the many other diadromous species. Brown trout are the most encountered fish in the Clutha River, occurring throughout the main river, streams, and nearby lakes. Rainbow trout also appear in the river but in smaller numbers, and they are more common in the lower section of the river compared to the upper stretches.

At the minimum, nine species of freshwater-limited Galaxias have been identified in the Clutha River by genetics and morphology. A Nationally Critical species of Galaxias called &quot;Clutha flathead species D&quot; occurs in various parts of the catchment. A 2022 study by &quot;Diversity and Distributions&quot; revealed that the river is home to a diverse range of Galaxias vulgaris clades; its diversity is likely a reflection of the Clutha River&#x27;s complex geological processes. The study emphasises the importance of the genome-wide methods to identify species and understand biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems and conservation in the Clutha River.

Before the construction of Roxburgh Dam, salmon could be found traversing the length of the Clutha River and spawning as far upstream as Lakes Hāwea and Wānaka. The Clutha is the southernmost recognised salmon river; salmon continue to arrive each spring and summer, though numbers have decreased since the construction of Roxburgh Dam. Common bullies, smelt, and perch are also found in the river.

A 1981 assessment of the river by the Upper Clutha Valley Development with the Ministry of Works and Development emphasised the high-quality waters of the river and very low levels of phytoplankton biomasses present.

==Floods==
Several major floods have occurred on the Clutha, most notably the &quot;Hundred year floods&quot; of October 1878 and October 1978. During the October 1878 flood, snow from the Southern Alps began to melt and the river started to rise. Central Otago experienced widespread flooding and farm buildings were submerged to their rooftops while rivers filled with dead horses and sheep, timber from farms and mine workings, and trees with a diameter of . A bridge in Clyde collapsed on 29 September, and its wreckage floated down to Roxburgh, where it struck a bridge there. The bridges at Bannockburn, Beaumont and Roxbrugh were swept away. As a result, this caused significant damage downstream. Over 21,000 livestock were lost when waters flooded over . The Balclutha Bridge collapsed on 13 October.

The 1978 flood breached the banks of rivers from the Ōreti in the south to the Tokomairaro. Over of land was inundated, with the loss of over 21,000 livestock. Towns and areas affected stretched from Makarora in the north to Invercargill in the south. The town of Wyndham was completely evacuated, and the towns of Balclutha, Milton and Mataura were seriously affected with many residents moved. The small settlement of Kelso on the banks of the Pomahaka River was completely abandoned and was not rebuilt once the waters subsided. At its peak, on 15 October, the Clutha&#x27;s flow was measured at just over .

A major flood in November 1999 seriously damaged river communities, especially Alexandra. The flooding in Alexandra was attributed to a rise in the riverbed resulting from silt loading in the Roxburgh reservoir behind the Roxburgh Dam, downriver from the town. The 1999 flood had significantly higher water levels in Alexandra than the 1878 flood, despite being only 80% of the volume of the latter.

== Dams ==
There are two hydroelectric power stations on the Clutha River, the 464MW Clyde Dam and the 320MW Roxburgh Dam, which together provide about 22% of the South Island&#x27;s hydroelectric power supply to the New Zealand power grid.

The Clutha River&#x27;s first dam was the Nil Desperandum Dam in the Upper Clutha Valley, existing from 1864–66. The Roxburgh Dam was the first substantial dam in the South Island. Construction on the dam began in 1949. Four turbines were installed in 1956–57 and four more in 1960–61. Its installed capacity is 320MW.

Construction began on the Clyde Dam in 1982 and was completed in 1993. It was a somewhat controversial project, with opposition and criticism from environmentalists and local residents. Completion of the Clyde Dam took much longer than expected, at a final cost more than 45% higher than the first estimate. The Clyde Dam was one of Robert Muldoon&#x27;s and the Third National Government&#x27;s &quot;Think Big&quot; projects, an interventionist state economic strategy. Several Local Authorities along the Clutha River use it as a source for treatment plants to provide communities with potable water.

Further dam projects have been proposed for the river, but as of 2012, all have been cancelled.

==Recreation==
The Clutha provides irrigation for stone fruit orchards and vineyards around Cromwell, Alexandra, and Roxburgh, which grow apples, apricots, nectarines, cherries, peaches and grapes. There are more vineyards in the upper reaches of the river at Bannockburn, Bendigo, Tarras and Wānaka.

<text>The Dominion of New Zealand was the historical successor to the Colony of New Zealand. It was a constitutional monarchy with a high level of self-government within the British Empire.

New Zealand became a separate British Crown colony in 1841 and received responsible government with the Constitution Act in 1852. New Zealand chose not to take part in the Federation of Australia and became the Dominion of New Zealand on 26 September 1907, Dominion Day, by proclamation of King Edward VII. Dominion status was a public mark of the political independence that had evolved over half a century through responsible government.

Just under one million people lived in New Zealand in 1907 and cities such as Auckland and Wellington were growing rapidly. The Dominion of New Zealand allowed the British Government to shape its foreign policy, and it followed Britain into the First World War. The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties, and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan. When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the New Zealand Government made its own decision to enter the war.

In the post-war period, the term &quot;Dominion&quot; has fallen into disuse. Sovereignty on external affairs was granted with the Statute of Westminster in 1931 and adopted by the New Zealand Parliament in 1947. The 1907 royal proclamation of Dominion status has never been revoked, although legal academics differ as to whether the proclamation can be said to be in force.

==Dominion status==

===Debate===

The alteration in status was stirred by a sentiment on the part of the prime ministers of the self-governing colonies of the British Empire that a new term was necessary to differentiate them from the non-self-governing colonies. At the 1907 Imperial Conference, it was argued that self-governing colonies that were not styled &#x27;Dominion&#x27; (like Canada) or &#x27;commonwealth&#x27; (like Australia) should be designated by some such title as &#x27;state of the empire&#x27;. After much debate over lexicon, the term &#x27;Dominion&#x27; was decided upon.

Following the 1907 conference, the New Zealand House of Representatives passed a motion requesting that King Edward VII &quot;take such steps as he may consider necessary&quot; to change the designation of New Zealand from the &quot;Colony of New Zealand&quot; to the &quot;Dominion of New Zealand&quot;.

The adoption of the designation of Dominion would, &quot;raise the status of New Zealand&quot; stated Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward and &quot;… have no other effect than that of doing the country good&quot;. Ward also had regional imperial ambitions. He hoped the new designation would remind the world that New Zealand was not part of Australia. It would dignify New Zealand, a country he thought was &quot;the natural centre for the government of the South Pacific&quot;.

Dominion status was strongly opposed by Leader of the Opposition William Massey, an ardent British imperialist, who suspected that the change would lead to demands for increases in viceregal and ministerial salaries.

===Royal proclamation===

A royal proclamation granting New Zealand the designation of &#x27;Dominion&#x27; was issued on 9 September 1907. On 26 September the Prime Minister, Sir Joseph Ward, read the proclamation from the steps of Parliament:


===Effect and reception===

With the attaining of Dominion status, the colonial treasurer became the minister of finance and the Colonial Secretary&#x27;s Office was renamed the Department of Internal Affairs. The proclamation of 10 September also designated members of the House of Representatives as &quot;M.P.&quot; (Member of Parliament). Previously they were designated &quot;M.H.R.&quot; (Member of the House of Representatives).

Letters patent were issued to confirm New Zealand&#x27;s change in status, declaring that: &quot;there shall be a Governor and Commander-in-Chief in and over Our Dominion of New Zealand&quot;. Dominion status allowed New Zealand to become virtually independent, while retaining the British monarch as head of state, represented by a governor appointed in consultation with the New Zealand Government. Control over defence, constitutional amendments, and (partially) foreign affairs remained with the British Government.

Joseph Ward had thought that New Zealanders would be &quot;much gratified&quot; with the new title. Dominion status was in fact received with limited enthusiasm or indifference from the general public, who were unable to discern any practical difference. Dominion status symbolised New Zealand&#x27;s shift to self-governance, but this change had been practically accomplished with the first responsible government in the 1850s.

Historian Keith Sinclair later remarked:

According to Dame Silvia Cartwright, 18th Governor-General of New Zealand, in a 2001 speech:

The national flag, depicting the British Union Flag, remained the same. Until 1911 New Zealand used the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom on all official documents and public buildings, but following its new status a new coat of arms for New Zealand was designed. A royal warrant granting armorial ensigns and supports was issued on 26 August 1911 and published in the &quot;New Zealand Gazette&quot; on 11 January 1912.

For a further decade, until 1917, the viceroy retained the title &#x27;governor&#x27;; letters patent were issued re-designating the viceroy as &#x27;governor-general&#x27; (as in other Dominions). The new title better reflected New Zealand&#x27;s prestige within the British Empire. The 1917 letters patent constituted the office, with the officeholder described as &#x27;Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief in and over Our Dominion of New Zealand&#x27;.

Despite the new status, there was some apprehension in 1919 when Prime Minister Bill Massey signed the Treaty of Versailles (giving New Zealand membership of the League of Nations). This act was a turning point in New Zealand&#x27;s diplomatic history, indicating that the Dominion had a degree of control over its foreign affairs. Massey himself did not view it as a symbolic act and would have preferred New Zealand to maintain a deferential role within the empire.

==Dominion Day==
To mark the granting of Dominion status, 26 September was declared Dominion Day.

Today, it is observed only as a Provincial Anniversary Day holiday in South Canterbury. There is support in some quarters for the day to be revived as an alternative New Zealand Day, instead of renaming Waitangi Day, New Zealand&#x27;s current national day.

==Territorial expansion==

The Antarctic territory of the Ross Dependency, previously under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, is today regarded by New Zealand as having become part of the Dominion of New Zealand on 16 August 1923. The legality of that contemporary assertion has been questioned but is nonetheless the position of New Zealand.

The Cook Islands and Niue each already formed part of the Dominion of New Zealand on the date it was proclaimed. Both had become part of the Colony of New Zealand on 11 June 1901. Western Samoa was never part of New Zealand, having instead been the subject of a League of Nations mandate and subsequently a United Nations Trusteeship agreement. In 1982 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council allowed Samoans born under New Zealand administration (i.e. prior to 1962) to claim New Zealand citizenship.

==Changes to Dominion status==

===Balfour Declaration===


The 1926 Imperial Conference devised the &#x27;Balfour formula&#x27; of Dominion status, stating that: The Balfour Report further resolved that each respective governor-general occupied &quot;the same position in relation to the administration of public affairs in the Dominion&quot; as was held by the monarch in the United Kingdom. Consequently, the only advisers to the governor-general (and the monarch in New Zealand) were his New Zealand ministers.

Prime Minister Gordon Coates, who led the New Zealand delegation to the conference, called the Balfour Declaration a &quot;poisonous document&quot; that would weaken the British Empire as a whole.

===Statute of Westminster===

In 1931, the British (Imperial) Parliament passed the Statute of Westminster, which repealed the imperial Colonial Laws Validity Act and gave effect to resolutions passed by the imperial conferences of 1926 and 1930. It essentially gave legal recognition to the &quot;de facto sovereignty&quot; of the Dominions by removing Britain&#x27;s ability to make laws for the Dominions without their consent: 

New Zealand initially viewed the Statute of Westminster as an &quot;unnecessary legal complication that it perceived would weaken imperial relations.&quot; The New Zealand Government only allowed the Dominion of New Zealand to be cited in the statute provided that the operative sections did not apply unless adopted by the New Zealand Parliament. Preferring the British Government to handle most of its foreign affairs and defence, New Zealand held back from adopting the Statute of Westminster Act.

The First Labour Government (1935–1949) pursued a more independent path in foreign affairs, in spite of the statute remaining unadopted. In 1938 Deputy Prime Minister Peter Fraser told Parliament, &quot;this country has to make up its own mind on international problems as a sovereign country – because under the Statute of Westminster ours is a sovereign country&quot;. In the 1944 Speech from the Throne the Governor-General announced the government&#x27;s intention to adopt the Statute of Westminster. It was forced to abandon the proposal when the opposition accused the government of being disloyal to Britain at a time of need. 
Ironically, the National opposition prompted the adoption of the statute in 1947 when its leader, and future prime minister, Sidney Holland introduced a member&#x27;s bill to abolish the Legislative Council. Because New Zealand required the consent of the British Parliament to make the necessary amendments to the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, Peter Fraser, now Prime Minister, had a reason to finally adopt the statute. It was formally adopted on 25 November 1947 with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947, along with consenting legislation from the British Parliament.

New Zealand was the last Dominion listed in the statute to adopt it.

==Dominion in disuse==

After the Second World War, the country joined the United Nations as simply &quot;New Zealand&quot;. A year later in 1946, Prime Minister Peter Fraser instructed government departments not to use the term Dominion any longer.

One of the first marks of New Zealand&#x27;s sovereignty was the alteration of the monarch&#x27;s title by the Royal Titles Act 1953. For the first time, the monarch&#x27;s official New Zealand title mentioned New Zealand separately from the United Kingdom and the other Dominions, now called &quot;Realms&quot;:
The name of the state in official usage was also changed to the Realm of New Zealand. The term Dominion largely fell into disuse over the next decade. The term persisted the longest in the names of institutions (for instance, the Dominion Museum was not renamed the National Museum until 1972), businesses, and in the constitutions of clubs and societies. &quot;The Dominion Post&quot;, a newspaper formed by a merger of &quot;The Dominion&quot; (first published on 26 September 1907, the day New Zealand achieved Dominion status) and &quot;The Evening Post&quot;, dropped &quot;Dominion&quot; to become &quot;The Post&quot; as late as April 2023.

The change in style did not otherwise affect the legal status of New Zealand or its Government; the 1907 royal proclamation of Dominion status has never been revoked and remains in force today. As such, the term &#x27;dominion&#x27; may be included in the formal title of New Zealand.

Nevertheless, the opinion of the New Zealand Government is that New Zealand became sovereign on foreign issues in 1947: &quot;…both in terms of gaining formal legal control over the conduct of its foreign policy and the attainment of constitutional and plenary powers by its legislature&quot;. In passing the Constitution Act 1986 (effective 1 January 1987), New Zealand &quot;unilaterally revoked all residual United Kingdom legislative power&quot;. Legal academics Dame Alison Quentin-Baxter and Janet McLean argue the 1907 proclamation should be regarded as &quot;spent&quot;, albeit not revoked.

== Demography ==

=== Population summary of the Dominion of New Zealand in 1911 ===

In the 1911 census, the total population of the Dominion of New Zealand was counted as 1,058,313 – an overall increase of 122,004 people or 13.03% over the 1906 census figure. This number also included half-castes and Chinese people. Māori were not included as part of the total population of the official census and were instead counted separately; the Māori population was counted at 49,829 people, and 15 Moriori living on the Chatham Islands.

<text>Lake Wānaka is New Zealand&#x27;s fourth-largest lake and the seat of the town of Wānaka in the Otago region. The lake is 278 meters above sea level, covers , and is more than deep.

&quot;Wānaka&quot; is the South Island dialect pronunciation of , which means &quot;the lore of the tohunga or priest&quot; or a place of learning.

==Geography==

===Geography===
Lake Wānaka lies at the heart of the Otago Lakes in the lower South Island of New Zealand. The township of Wānaka, which sits in a glacier-carved basin on the shores of the lake, is the gateway to Mt Aspiring National Park. Lake Hāwea is a 15-minute drive away, en route to the frontier town of Makarora, the last stop before the West Coast Glacier region. To the south is the historic Cardrona Valley, a popular scenic alpine route to neighbouring Queenstown.

===Geology===
Lake Wānaka lies in a u-shaped valley formed by glacial erosion during the last ice age more than 10,000 years ago. It is fed by the Matukituki and Makarora Rivers, and is the source of the Clutha River / Mata-Au.

At its greatest extent, which is roughly along a north–south axis, the lake is 42 kilometres long. Its widest point, at the southern end, is 10 kilometres. The lake&#x27;s western shore is lined with high peaks rising to over 2000 metres above sea level. Along the eastern shore the land is also mountainous, but the peaks are somewhat lower.

Nearby Lake Hāwea lies in a parallel valley carved by a neighbouring glacier eight kilometres to the east. At their closest point (a rocky ridge called The Neck), the lakes are only 1000 metres apart.

Four small islands within the lake include Ruby Island, Stevensons Island, and (Harwich) Island. Some host ecological sanctuaries, such as one for buff weka on Stevensons Island. island is 120 hectares in size and is a pest free island. Mountain stone wētā and the Southern Alps gecko can be found here.

The towns of Wānaka and Albert Town are near the lake&#x27;s outflow into the Clutha River / Mata-Au.

==Human history==

===Exploration and settlement===
For Māori, the Wānaka area was a natural crossroads. The Haast Pass gave access to the West Coast and its pounamu; the Cardrona Valley led to the natural rock bridge &quot;&quot;, which was the only place that the Kawarau River and (the Clutha River) could be crossed without boats. Native reeds were used to build , small boats that enabled a swift return downriver to the east coast. The Cromwell basin supported a large population of moa, which were hunted to extinction about 500 years ago.

Until the early nineteenth century, Wānaka was visited annually by Ngāi Tahu who sought pounamu in the mountains above the Haast River and hunted eels and birds over summer, returning to the east coast by descending in (reed boats).

According to the Ngāi Tahu, Lake Wānaka was dug by the Waitaha explorer with his (foot plough) named . After Waitaha arrived in the at (Nelson), divided his people into two groups. led his group down the middle of the island, digging the freshwater lakes of Te Waipounamu (the South Island).

Numerous (food-gathering places) and (settlements) were located around the lake. The Kāti Māmoe settlement at the southern end of the lake was named . The area was invaded by the Ngāi Tahu in the early 18th century.

Ngāi Tahu use of the land was ended by attacks by North Island tribes. In the last years of the Musket Wars, in 1836 the Ngāti Tama chief Te Pūoho led a 100-person (war party), armed with muskets, down the West Coast and over the Haast Pass. They fell on the Ngāi Tahu encampment between Lake Wānaka and Lake Hāwea, capturing 10 people and killing and eating two children. Although Te Puoho was later killed by the southern Ngāi Tahu leader Tūhawaiki, Māori seasonal visits to the area ceased.

The first recorded map of Lake Wānaka was drawn in 1844 by the southern Ngāi Tahu leader . The first Pākehā to see the lake was Nathanael Chalmers in 1853. Guided by and , he walked from (Southland) to the lake via the Kawarau River. However he was stricken by dysentery, so his guides returned him down the Clutha, shooting the rapids in a .

By 1861, several sheep stations had been established in and around the south end of the lake, and in 1862, the lake itself was surveyed in a whaleboat.

===Names===
The name &quot;Lake Wanaka&quot; was in use in 1863 when the first survey of the proposed township of Wanaka was made.

The town was renamed &quot;Pembroke&quot; within a month of the surveyor returning his books to Dunedin. It reverted to &quot;Wanaka&quot; on 1 September 1940, to reduce confusion between the names of the town and the lake.

The official name of the lake was updated from &quot;Lake Wanaka&quot; to &quot;Lake Wānaka&quot; in 2019, and the town&#x27;s name to &quot;Wānaka&quot; in 2021.

===Current use and tourism===

The lake is now a popular resort, and is much used in the summer for fishing, boating and swimming. The nearby mountains and fast-flowing rivers support adventure tourism year-round.

Popular activities include alpine and cross-country skiing and snowsports, tramping, mountain-biking, mountaineering, rock-climbing and parapenting.

===Conservation===
As one of the few lakes in the South Island with an unmodified shoreline, the lake is protected by special legislation, the Lake Wanaka Preservation Act of 1973. The Act established a &#x27;Guardians of Lake Wanaka&#x27; group, appointed by the Minister of Conservation, which advises on measures to protect the lake.

Oxygen weed (&quot;Lagarosiphon major&quot;), an aquarium plant and invasive species native to Southern Africa, has been a problem in the lake&#x27;s ecosystem for some time. Attempts to eradicate the weed have not been successful. Substantial suction dredging operations have shown promise, but tend to miss isolated spots which then regrow into larger weed beds.

== Pūteketeke conservation ==
In 2013 zoologist John Darby established the Lake Wānaka Grebe Project. Floating platforms on which the birds can nest have resulted in an increase in breeding pairs. The pūteketeke was New Zealand&#x27;s Bird of the Year in 2023 after an international publicity campaign mounted by British-American comedian John Oliver.

==Climate==

==In popular culture==

A willow growing just inside the lake, often known as &quot;That Wānaka Tree&quot;, is a tourist attraction in its own right, featuring on many tourists&#x27; Instagram feeds.

===In film===

The region has been the setting for many international films, including &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the &quot;Legend of S&quot;, and &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;. Lake Wānaka was mentioned several times in the 2006 movie &quot;&quot; as a location the lead couple visited and as the answer to Ethan Hunt&#x27;s question on the phone to verify the identity of his wife.

The New Zealand cook and author Annabel Langbein, who owns a small estate at the side of the lake, filmed her series &quot;The Free Range Cook&quot; and &quot;Simple Pleasures&quot; here.

===As a doomsday refuge===
New Zealand, and Wānaka and Queenstown in particular, have been reported to be a favoured refuge for the &#x27;super rich&#x27; in the event of a cataclysm. One such high net worth individual is Peter Thiel, who purchased of lakeside land in 2015. While he had not yet developed it , plans have been announced to develop it as a luxury resort.

<doc id="431400" wikidata="Q864148" url="?curid=431400" title="Bungo Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of eastern Kyūshū, corresponding to most of modern Ōita Prefecture, except what is now the cities of Nakatsu and Usa. Bungo bordered on Hyūga to the south, Higo and Chikugo to the west, and Chikuzen and Buzen to the north. Its abbreviated form was , although it was also called . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Bungo was one of the provinces of the Saikaidō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Bungo was ranked as one of the &quot;superior countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;far countries&quot; (遠国) in terms of distance from the capital.

==History==
===Early history===
During the Kofun period, the area of Bungo had three main power centers: the Kunisaki Peninsula, the area around what is now Ōita District and the area around Hita District, each of which was ruled by a &quot;kuni no miyatsuko&quot;. By the Asuka period, the area had been consolidated into a single province called Toyo Province, also called &quot;Toyokuni no Michi no Shiri&quot;. After the Taika Reforms and the establishment of the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system in 701, Toyo Province was divided into Bungo and Buzen Provinces. The &quot;Bungo no Kuni Fudoki&quot;, which was compiled in the first half of the 8th century, is one of only five &quot;fudoki&quot; in Japan that remains in almost complete form.

It is believed that the &quot;kokufu&quot; Bungo was located in the &quot;Furugō&quot; (古国府), literally &quot;old capital,&quot; section of the city of Ōita, but as of 2023 no archaeological evidence has been found. Two shrines vie for the title of &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of Bungo Province: the Yusuhara Hachimangū and the Sasamuta Shrine, both of which are located in the city of Ōita, as is the Bungo Kokubun-ji. Usa Jingū, commonly known as &quot;Usa Hachimangū&quot;, is often mistakenly stated to be the &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province, but it is located in former Buzen Province and not Bungo.

In 1185, at the end of the Heian period, after the Heike clan was destroyed in the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo established the Ōtomo clan as &quot;shugo&quot; over Bungo Province in order to suppress the pro-Taira clan samurai in Kyushu. The Ōtomo ruled the area from the Kamakura period into the Muromachi period and over the course of many conflicts expanded their control into neighboring provinces. The area saw an influx of western culture and technology with the influx of Portuguese traders in the Sengoku period, together with the introduction of firearms and Christianity. The Funai area became a center of Jesuit activity. Ōtomo Sōrin met personally with Francis Xavier in 1551, and later converted to Christianity. Referred to as the &quot;King of Bungo&quot; in the Jesuit records, Sōrin sent political delegations to Goa in the 1550s, and the Tenshō embassy to Rome in 1582. He also forced his subjects to convert. and ordered the destruction of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines in his domains. In 1578, he came into conflict with the Shimazu clan to the south and after being defeated in a series of battles turned to Toyotomi Hideyoshi for assistance. In 1587, following Hideyoshi&#x27;s iconquest of Kyūshū, Sōrin&#x27;s son, Ōtomo Yoshimune was restored to control over Bungo. Following Hideyoshi&#x27;s expulsion of foreign missionaries and edicts against the &quot;Kirishitan&quot; faith, he recanted his baptism and began a vigorous campaign to exterminate Christianity in the province. However, he subsequently was accused of cowardice during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and was dispossessed. Bungo was divided into small holdings.

===Edo Period and early modern period===
Unlike many of the provinces of Kyūshū, Bungo was not dominated by a single &quot;daimyō&quot;; rather, it was divided into &quot;tenryō&quot; territory directly governed by the Tokugawa shogunate and a number small feudal domains.

Following the Meiji restoration, each of the feudal domains briefly became prefectures. These were merged on December 25, 1871 to form Ōita Prefecture. Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation&#x27;s resources, Bungo Province had 1812 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 466,611 &quot;koku&quot;. Bungo Province consisted of:

<doc id="431403" wikidata="Q1040807" url="?curid=431403" title="Lady Sarah Chatto">
<text>Lady Sarah Frances Elizabeth Chatto (née Armstrong-Jones; born 1 May 1964) is a member of the British royal family. She is the only daughter of Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon. She and her brother, David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon, are the only maternal first cousins of King Charles III. She is the youngest grandchild of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. At her birth, she was 7th in line to the British throne; as of January 2025, she is 29th. Though she does not undertake public duties, she frequently attends events and ceremonies with the wider royal family.

==Early life and education==
Sarah Armstrong-Jones was born on 1 May 1964 at Kensington Palace in London. She is the second child and only daughter of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon. She was baptised in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace on 13 July 1964.

Lady Sarah is a godmother to Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Lady Rose Gilman, and Lady Louise Windsor. She also has half-siblings on her father&#x27;s side: Polly Fry (born 1960), Lady Frances Armstrong-Jones (born 1979), and Jasper Cable-Alexander (born 1998).

Lady Sarah and her brother, David, then Viscount Linley, grew up in the nursery of Kensington Palace, Apartment 10. They were raised with a nanny called Verona Sumner, although their parents, especially their father, were comparatively hands-on (for the time), with their father teaching them to build things and be creative.

Their parents&#x27; marriage was fractious; the couple formally separated when Sarah was 12 and divorced when she was 14. She and her brother spent weekends, depending on with which parent, at either Nymans or Royal Lodge. Holidays were given to the royal estates at Sandringham and Balmoral, where Lady Sarah did much landscape painting.

Lady Sarah was a bridesmaid at the wedding of her cousin Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer. She accompanied her mother and brother on an official visit to China and Hong Kong in May 1987.

She attended Bedales School, which she left with a single A level in Art. She enrolled at the Camberwell School of Art. She also studied art at the Royal Academy Schools. She then spent two years in India with her father, where he was employed to photograph the production of &quot;A Passage to India&quot;. The film&#x27;s producer, her relative John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne (son-in-law of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma), gave her a job as an intern assisting the wardrobe department and studying wood gilding under her father&#x27;s cousin Thomas Messel. Returning to England, she enrolled in a two-year course in textile and fabric design at Middlesex Polytechnic (later renamed as Middlesex University).

==Professional life==
Chatto has been exhibiting her work, always under the name Sarah Armstrong-Jones, at The Redfern Gallery since 1995. Her work has won awards: the Winsor &amp; Newton Prize in 1988 and the Creswick Landscape Prize in 1990.

In 2004, she became vice president of the Royal Ballet, of which her mother had been president. She was named president in 2024.

Chatto does not undertake public duties and is not considered a &quot;working royal&quot;. However, it has been reported that she was close to her aunt Queen Elizabeth II, being the queen&#x27;s niece. Chatto is frequently seen attending public events such as jubilees and funerals, as well as semi-private royal family events, such as the Sandringham Christmas service, with her sons.

==Marriage and children==
Lady Sarah met Daniel Chatto during her years in India with her father in the 1980s. Chatto was working on another British film, &quot;Heat and Dust&quot;. He is from a theatrical family, the son of actor Tom Chatto (1920–1982) and the theatrical agent Ros Chatto (born Rosalind Joan Thompson; died 2012). He proposed to her with a &quot;vintage cluster ring.&quot;

The couple married on 14 July 1994; the Reverend Chad Varah, founder of the Samaritans, officiated at the wedding, held at St Stephen&#x27;s, Walbrook in the City of London. The bride&#x27;s wedding gown was designed by Jasper Conran. Her bridesmaids were half-sister Lady Frances, Zara Phillips (daughter of her first cousin Princess Anne), and Tara Noble-Singh, a family friend.

The couple have two sons:

*Samuel David Benedict Chatto (born 28 July 1996), 30th in the line of succession . He studied at Eton, and went on to study history of art at the University of Edinburgh, and works as a sculptor, based in West Sussex. He also completed yoga teacher training in India.
*Arthur Robert Nathaniel Chatto (born 5 February 1999), 31st in the line of succession, and a former page of honour to Queen Elizabeth II, his great-aunt, from 2009 to 2015. He initially attended Westminster Cathedral Choir School before going to Eton College. He then studied geography at the University of Edinburgh, and at the same time worked as a personal trainer. As of June 2022, he was serving with the Royal Marines.

<doc id="431407" wikidata="Q1047664" url="?curid=431407" title="Chikuzen Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of northern Kyūshū, corresponding to part of north and western Fukuoka Prefecture. Chikuzen bordered on Hizen to the east, and Buzen east, and Bungo to the southeast. Its abbreviated form name was (a name which it shared with Chikugo Province), although it was also called . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Chikuzen was one of the provinces of the Saikaidō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Chikuzen was ranked as one of the &quot;superior countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;far countries&quot; (遠国) in terms of distance from the capital. 

==History==
Ancient Tsukushi Province was a major power center in the Yayoi period, with contacts to the Asian mainland and may have been the site for the Kingdom of Yamatai mentioned in official Chinese dynastic Twenty-Four Histories for the 1st- and 2nd-century Eastern Han dynasty, the 3rd-century &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, and the 6th-century &quot;Book of Sui&quot;. During the Kofun period, many burial mounds were constructed and the area was ruled by a powerful clan who held the title of &quot;Tsukushi no &quot;kuni no miyatsuko&quot;&quot;. The semi-legendary 14th ruler of Japan, Emperor Chūai is said to have had a palace in Chikuzen at what is now the Kashii-gū shrine. The area was the launching point for Empress Jingu&#x27;s purported conquest of Korea, and was the settlement area for many &quot;toraijin&quot; immigrants from China, Silla and Baekje. In 527, the Iwai Rebellion between rival factions supporting Silla against Yamato rule occurred. In 531, the priest Zensho arrived from Northern Wei and established &quot;Shugendo&quot;. In 663, the Yamato government, which was defeated by the combined Silla and Tang China forces at the Battle of Hakusonko, decided to establish Dazaifu as a regional military and civil administrative center, and after the Taika Reforms and the establishment of the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system in 701, Tsukushi Province was divided into Chikuzen and Chikugo Provinces.

The &quot;kokufu&quot; of Chikuzen is believed to have been located in what is now part of the city of Dazaifu, although its exact location has not yet been discovered. The ruins of the Chikuzen Kokubun-ji are located in the same area, and are a National Historic Site. The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of Chikuzen Province is Sumiyoshi Shrine, located in Hakata-ku, Fukuoka, although the early records of the province indicate that Hakozaki Shrine was the &quot;ichinomiya&quot;. 

At the end of the 13th century, Chikuzen was the landing point for a Mongol invasion force. But the main force was destroyed by a typhoon (later called kamikaze).

In April 1336, Kikuchi Taketoshi attacked the Shoni clan stronghold at Dazaifu. At the time, the Shoni were allied with Ashikaga Takauji in his battles against Go-Daigo. The Shoni were defeated, which led to the suicide of several clan members, including their leader Shoni Sadatsune. 

Chikuzen in the Edo period was almost entirely under the control of Fukuoka Domain, ruled by the Kuroda clan to the Meiji restoration. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. However, the name of the province continued to exist for some purposes. For example, Chikuzen is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom. It also persists in features such as the Chikuhō Main Line (JR Kyushu) and stations Chikuzen Habu and Chikuzen Ueki. The adjacent Haruda Line includes Chikuzen Uchino and Chikuzen Yamae stations, reflecting the region in the time the rail networks were established.

Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation&#x27;s resources, Chikuzen Province had 862 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 633,434 &quot;koku&quot;. Chikuzen Province consisted of:

<text>Lady Davina Elizabeth Alice Benedikte Windsor (born 19 November 1977) is a member of the British royal family, and is the elder daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. She is 36th in the line of succession to the British throne . She was known as Lady Davina Lewis between 2004 and 2018, during her marriage to Gary Lewis.

==Early life and education== 

Davina was born at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London. She was baptised on 19 February 1978 at Barnwell Parish Church, close to the family home, Barnwell Manor in Northamptonshire. Her godparents are Captain Mark Phillips, the Duke of Buccleuch, Elisabeth, Lady Camoys, Susan Wigley, Roger Wellesley Smith and Caroline, Baroness Rosenørn-Lehn. Lady Davina grew up in Kensington Palace. She was educated at Kensington Preparatory School in Notting Hill, followed by St George&#x27;s School, Ascot. She is a graduate of the University of the West of England, with a degree in media studies.

==Marriage and children==
On 31 July 2004, Davina married Gary Christie Lewis (born 1970), a Māori. Lewis is a carpenter who runs a property renovation business and is a surfing enthusiast. The couple had known each other for four years, having met on holiday in Bali, but they kept their relationship secret for several years. Lewis is the son of Larry Lewis, a Māori builder who was runner-up in the Golden Shears sheep-shearing competition in 1982. His uncle is the prominent Māori author Witi Ihimaera who wrote &quot;The Whale Rider&quot; which became a film of the same name.

Lewis is also the first person of known Māori descent to marry a member of the royal family, or to marry the daughter of a British prince. As she is a legitimate descendant in the male line of George V and in line to the British throne, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 required that Royal Assent to the wedding be obtained in advance for the marriage to be legal and the descendants thereof to inherit rights of succession to the thrones of the Commonwealth realms, including that of New Zealand. On 20 July 2004, the Queen-in-Council formally declared her consent to the marriage. The wedding took place at the private chapel of Kensington Palace, Lady Davina&#x27;s childhood home. Apart from the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the bride&#x27;s siblings, no other members of the royal family were present at the wedding; only close friends and family were involved. The couple divorced in 2018.

Davina and her former husband have a daughter, Senna Kowhai, who was born on 22 June 2010 and a son, Tāne Mahuta, who was born 25 May 2012. Her son was named after the Tāne Mahuta, a giant kauri tree in the Waipoua Forest of Northland Region, New Zealand. Lady Davina was also stepmother to Lewis&#x27;s son from a previous relationship, Ari (born 1992).

Until 26 March 2015, Tāne was ahead of Senna in the line of succession to the British throne since sons had priority over daughters based on tradition and common law. When the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 took effect in all Commonwealth realms in 2015, Senna became the nearest relative of the reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, to be affected by the change in law, which advanced her proximity to the Crown by reversing her place in the order of succession with that of her younger brother. Senna and Tāne became 28th and 29th in line, respectively.

Lady Davina does not carry out official functions but does attend family events including royal weddings. Lady Davina and Gary Lewis were invited to attend the Queen&#x27;s reception for members of the New Zealand All Blacks at Buckingham Palace in 2005. She and her then husband also attended Prince William&#x27;s wedding in 2011.

<doc id="431426" wikidata="Q1188364" url="?curid=431426" title="Phainopepla">
<text>The phainopepla or northern phainopepla (Phainopepla nitens) is the most northerly representative of the mainly tropical Central American family Ptiliogonatidae, the silky flycatchers. Its name is from the Greek meaning &quot;shining robe&quot; in reference to the male&#x27;s plumage.

==Description==
The phainopepla is a striking bird, long with a noticeable crest and a long tail; it is slender, and has an upright posture when it perches. Its bill is short and slender. The male is glossy black, and has a white wing patch that is visible when it flies; the female is plain gray and has a lighter gray wing patch. Both sexes have red eyes, but these are more noticeable in the female than the male.

==Range and habitat==
The phainopepla ranges as far north as central California with the San Joaquin Valley and southern Utah, and south to central Mexico, the interior Mexican Plateau region; the southern edge of the plateau, the transverse mountains is its non-breeding home. It is found in hot areas, including desert oases, and is readily seen in the deserts of Arizona, southern Nevada, and southern California; also the Baja Peninsula, both Baja California-(north), and Baja California Sur where they are the only breeding resident birds. Extreme individuals have travelled as far as Canada, with one bird in 2009 reaching as far north as Brampton, Ontario, Canada.

==Diet==
Their diet consists of berries, any small insects, fruits, vegetables. Phainopeplas have a specialized mechanism in their gizzard that shucks berry skins off the fruit and packs the skins separately from the rest of the fruit into the intestines for more efficient digestion. So far this is the only known bird able to do this. They appear to relish the fruit of &quot;Phoradendron californicum&quot;, the desert mistletoe.

=== Symbiosis with desert mistletoe ===
Phainopepla are closely associated with desert mistletoe, and are the most effective dispersers of its seeds. As a mistletoe specialist, phainopepla have a specialized digestive system, and process berries very quickly without the gizzard crushing the seeds; berries are defecated 12–45 minutes after being eaten. As a result, each bird can process hundreds of berries in a day. Phainopepla derive fewer calories from each berry than non-specialist birds, but this ability to eat and quickly process large number of berries allows them to meet their daily caloric requirements, while non-specialist birds may not be able to do so on just mistletoe berries. Phainopepla deposit their feces on tree branches. In doing so, the mistletoe seeds within have a host tree to infect after they sprout.

==Reproduction==
It nests in the spring. They make loosely constructed nests of twigs, mosses, plant fibers, placed on branches of trees, usually below 20 feet from the ground, in thickets or open woods near water. The eggs are gray or pink and speckled, and the incubation, done by both the male and female, takes fifteen days. The young will be reared by the parents for up to nineteen more days.
==Song==
Phainopeplas have been found to imitate the calls of twelve other species, such as the red-tailed hawk (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;) and the northern flicker (&quot;Colaptes auratus&quot;).

<doc id="431427" wikidata="Q906926" url="?curid=431427" title="Hizen Province">
<text>was an old province of Japan in the area of the Saga and Nagasaki prefectures. It was sometimes called , with Higo Province. Hizen bordered on the provinces of Chikuzen and Chikugo. The province was included in Saikaidō. It did not include the island provinces (now municipalities) of Tsushima and Iki that are now part of modern Nagasaki Prefecture.

==History==
The name &quot;Hizen&quot; dates from the Nara period &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; &quot;Kokugunri&quot; system reforms, when the province was divided from Higo Province. The name appears in the early chronicle &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; from 696 AD. The ancient provincial capital of Hizen was located near Yamato City.

During the late Muromachi period, the province was the site of much early contact between Japan and Portuguese and Spanish merchants and missionaries. Hirado, and later Nagasaki became major foreign trade centers, and a large percentage of the population converted to Roman Catholicism. Toyotomi Hideyoshi directed the invasion of Korea from the city of Nagoya, in Hizen, and after the suppression of foreign contacts and prohibition against the &quot;Kirishitan&quot; religion, the Shimabara Rebellion also took place in Hizen province.

===List of han===
During the Edo period, Hizen Province was divided among several &quot;daimyōs&quot;, but dominated by the Nabeshima clan, whose domain was centered at the castle town of Saga. At the end of the Tokugawa shogunate, Hizen was divided between the following &quot;han&quot;:

During this period, the port of Nagasaki remained a tenryō territory, administered for the Tokugawa government by the Nagasaki bugyō, and contained the Dutch East India Company trading post of Dejima. After the Meiji Restoration in 1868 came the Abolition of the han system in 1871, whereby all daimyo were obliged to surrender their domains to the new Meiji government, which then divided the nation into numerous prefectures, which were consolidated into 47 prefectures and 3 urban areas by 1888. The former Hizen province was divided into modern Saga Prefecture and a portion of Nagasaki Prefecture. At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes. For example, Hizen is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.

<doc id="431432" wikidata="Q259705" url="?curid=431432" title="Higo Province">
<text>was an old province of Japan in the area that is today Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyūshū. It was sometimes called , with Hizen Province. Higo bordered on Chikugo, Bungo, Hyūga, Ōsumi, and Satsuma Provinces.

== History ==
The castle town of Higo was usually at Kumamoto City. During the Muromachi period, Higo was held by the Kikuchi clan, but they were dispossessed during the Sengoku period, and the province was occupied by neighboring lords, including the Shimazu clan of Satsuma, until Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Kyūshū and gave Higo to his retainers, first Sassa Narimasa and later Katō Kiyomasa. The Kato were soon stripped of their lands, and the region was given to the Hosokawa clan.

During the Sengoku Period, Higo was a major center for Christianity in Japan, and it is also the location where the philosopher, the artist and swordsman Miyamoto Musashi stayed at the Hosokawa &quot;daimyō&quot;″s invitation, Hosokawa Tadatoshi third lord of Kumamoto, while completing his &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot;. 
During the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Higo Province were reformed in the 1870s. At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes. For example, Higo is explicitly recognized in the 1894 treaties with the United States and the United Kingdom.

==Shrines and temples==
&quot;Aso-jinja&quot; was the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) of Higo.

<doc id="431433" wikidata="Q3122831" url="?curid=431433" title="ASPM (gene)">
<text>Abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated protein, also known as abnormal spindle protein homolog or Asp homolog, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ASPM gene. ASPM is located on chromosome 1, band q31 (1q31). The &quot;ASPM&quot; gene contains 28 exons and codes for a 3477 amino-acid-long protein. The ASPM protein is conserved across species including human, mouse, &quot;Drosophila&quot;, and &quot;C. elegans&quot;. Defective forms of the ASPM gene are associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly.

&quot;ASPM&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Abnormal Spindle-like, Microcephaly-associated&quot;, which reflects its being an ortholog to the &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; &quot;abnormal spindle&quot; (&quot;asp&quot;) gene. The expressed protein product of the asp gene is essential for normal mitotic spindle function in embryonic neuroblasts and regulation of neurogenesis.

A new allele of ASPM arose sometime in the past 14,000 years (mean estimate 5,800 years), during the Holocene, it seems to have swept through much of the European and Middle-Eastern population. Although the new allele is evidently beneficial, researchers do not know what it does.

== Animal studies ==

The mouse gene, &quot;Aspm&quot;, is expressed in the primary sites of prenatal cerebral cortical neurogenesis. The difference between &quot;Aspm&quot; and ASPM is a single, large insertion coding for so-called IQ domains. Studies in mice also suggest a role of the expressed Aspm gene product in mitotic spindle regulation. The function is conserved, the &quot;C. elegans&quot; protein ASPM-1 was shown to be localized to spindle asters, where it regulates spindle organization and rotation by interacting with calmodulin, dynein and NuMA-related LIN-5.

One mouse study looking at medulloblastoma growth in mice to study the &quot;Aspm&quot; gene, an ortholog to human ASPM, suggests that &quot;Aspm&quot; expression may drive postnatal cerebellar neurogenesis. This process occurs late in embryogenesis and immediately after birth over a time span of about 2 weeks in mice and 12 months in humans, and is regulated by the expression of the &quot;Shh&quot; gene. In proliferating cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs), Shh expression in mouse models showed four times the amount of &quot;Aspm&quot; expression than those deprived of Shh expression in-vivo. This induction of &quot;Aspm&quot; and up-regulation during cerebellar neurogenesis was also seen in real-time PCR, where its expression was relatively high at the peak of neurogenesis and much lower at the end of neurogenesis. Additionally, the study indicates that &quot;Aspm&quot; is necessary for cerebellar neurogenesis. In the presence of &quot;Aspm&quot; KO mutations and deletions, experimental mice models show decreased cerebellar volume under MRI, compared to the controls. In addition to mutated &quot;Aspm&quot; effects on neurogenesis, these mutations may also play a role in neural differentiation. When looking at adult brains in &quot;Aspm&quot; KO mice, there was a trend in overall size reduction, and variations in cortical thickness between mutant and wild type models. In the somatosensory cortex, KO mice had a significantly thicker layer I cortex, thinner layer VI cortex, and an overall decrease in cortical thickness in the cortical plate. Certain transcription factors expressions were also abnormal in the KO mice. For example, Tbr1 and Satb2 had an increased presence in the cortical sub-plate, the first of which is important for differentiation and neuronal migration, and the second of which is a regulator of transcription and chromosomal remodeling.

While mouse studies have established the role of &quot;Aspm&quot; mutations in microcephaly, several have linked this mutation to other significant defects. One study showed nerve fiber impairments in which the shape and form of cortex and white matter tissue was altered. This was shown postnatally comparing KO mice and controls, where both cell number and cortical thickness was decreased in KO mice. Using a cell staining methodology for histological analysis, the study also showed shorter distances between adjacent neurons in KO mice, indicating abnormalities in cell alignment in the absence of normal &quot;Aspm&quot;.

Another significant impact of mutated &quot;Aspm&quot; is seen in germline abnormalities within mouse models. Mutations in &quot;Aspm&quot; were shown to reduce fertility in both female and male mice, indicated by a decrease in the rate of pregnancy and consequently the number of offspring, as well as a decrease in female ovarian size, as well as male sperm count and testicular size. The focus on severe germline mutations (as opposed to only mild microcephaly) in these mouse models raises the question as to whether or not human ASPM selection may be more significantly linked to reproduction than brain size.

In addition to mouse models, a study using ferrets reveals more about ASPM and its role in determining cortical size and thickness. The researchers from this study chose ferrets over mouse models due to incongruencies between &quot;Aspm&quot; effects in mice versus ASPM effects in humans - humans with microcephaly due to this gene mutation tend to have significantly reduced brain sizes (about 50% reduction), whereas the analogous mutation in mice only results in mild brain size reduction. Ferrets also show more similarities to humans in terms of brain structure; ferrets&#x27; brains have gyrification in high amounts similar to humans, different from the relatively smooth brains of mice. As a result, there is less cortical surface area in mice compared to that of ferrets and humans. In this 2018 study, researchers targeted &quot;Aspm&quot; exon 15, where a mutation in humans is linked to severe cases of microcephaly. With a loss of function in &quot;Aspm&quot;, ferrets with &quot;Aspm&quot; mutations saw a 40% decrease in overall brain size coupled with no reduction in body size, similar to the effects of loss of ASPM in humans. The study also looked at the neurodevelopmental pathways and mechanisms leading to neurogenesis in the KO ferrets compared to the WT controls, specifically studying three different neuron progenitor cell (NPC) types, all of which express the mitotic marker Ki-67 and undergo radial glial migration to the cortical plate. They found that outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) NPCs were largely displaced, especially frontally and dorsally which mirrors the effects seen in cortical volume reductions due to ASPM KO.

== Human studies ==
Human primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a distinct subtype that is genetically inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. MCPH is characterized by a smaller cerebral cortex associated with mild to moderate mental retardation and no other neurological deficits. Additionally, MCPH is associated with the absence of environmental causes such as intrauterine infections, exposure to prenatal radiation or drugs, maternal phenylketonuria, and birth asphyxia. MCPH has an incidence rate of 1/30,000 to 1/250,000 in western populations. To date, mutations in six loci and four genes associated with microcephaly have been discovered in humans. &quot;ASPM&quot;, one of these genes, is found at the MCPH5 locus. The most common cause of MCPH in humans is homozygous genetic mutation of the &quot;ASPM&quot; gene&quot;,&quot; orthologous to the &quot;Drosophila&quot; abnormal spindle gene (&quot;asp&quot;). In humans, the &quot;ASPM&quot; gene may play a strong role in the growth of the cerebral cortex. A total of 22 mutations have been discovered in the &quot;ASPM&quot; gene in individuals from Pakistan, Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the Netherlands.

A study completed in Karnataka, South India by Kumar et al. analyzed the genetics of MCPH due to mutations in the &quot;ASPM&quot; gene. The study included nine families with blood relatives across many familial generations. Kumar et al. performed High-resolution G-banding chromosome analysis and haplotype analysis of individuals and families of those affected by MCPH. Kumar et al. found that the South Indian families affected by mutations in the MCPH5 locus did not share a common disease haplotype; thus the authors proposed that different mutations in the &quot;ASPM&quot; gene are responsible for MCPH.

A similar genetic study of MCPH in Pakistani families was done by Gul et al. in order to evaluate the relationship between &quot;ASPM&quot; gene mutations and microcephaly. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Quaid-I-Azam University in Islamabad, Pakistan, and involved extraction of DNA and PCR techniques in order to genetically map the &quot;ASPM&quot; gene. Genotyping using microsatellite regions in the gene revealed that MCPH5 locus mutations were the most common cause of MCPH. Genotyping further linked mutations in the MCPH2 locus, MCPH4 locus, and the MCPH6 locus to microcephaly. Sequence analysis of &quot;ASPM&quot; in humans revealed four novel mutations; these four types of mutations are an insertion of four nucleotides (9118insCATT), a nonsense mutation (L3080X), a deletion of seven nucleotides (1260delTCAAGTC), and a missense mutation (Q3180P). Gul et al. found that parents who were heterozygous carriers for &quot;ASPM&quot; had normal cerebral circumferences and normal intelligence levels. The scientists were unable to identify mutations at the MCPH5 locus in nine families who had members affected by MCPH. They concluded that the mutations could be located in the regulatory sequences of &quot;ASPM&quot;, or that a gene other than &quot;ASPM&quot; located in the same region could be mutated.

The types of mutations causing MCPH in humans was expanded by a study done by Pichon et al. on an individual with primary microcephaly, as the study revealed a translocation breakpoint in the &quot;ASPM&quot; gene. Pichon et al. obtained BAC clones with &quot;Bam&quot;HI digestion fragments of the &quot;RP11-32D17&quot; insert and used Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) in order to label the clones with fluorescein-12-dUTP. In order to precisely locate the translocation breakpoint, the &quot;Bam&quot;HI digestion fragments of &quot;RP11-32D17&quot; were analyzed. The translocation breakpoint was located to be within intron 17 of the &quot;ASPM&quot; gene. The translocation resulted in a truncated ASPM protein, which is most likely a non-functioning protein also seen in truncating point mutations reported in MCPH patients.

== Evolution ==

A new allele (version) of ASPM appeared sometime within the last 14,100 years, with a mean estimate of 5,800 years ago. The new allele has a frequency of about 50% in populations of the Middle East and Europe, it is less frequent in East Asia, and has low frequencies among Sub-Saharan African populations. It is also found with an unusually high percentage among the people of Papua New Guinea, with a 59.4% occurrence.

The mean estimated age of the ASPM allele of 5,800 years ago roughly correlates with the development of written language, spread of agriculture and development of cities. Currently, two alleles of this gene exist: the older (pre-5,800 years ago) and the newer (post-5,800 years ago). About 10% of humans have two copies of the new ASPM allele, while about 50% have two copies of the old allele. The other 40% of humans have one copy of each. Of those with an instance of the new allele, 50% of them are an identical copy. The allele affects genotype over a large (62 kbp) region, a so called selective sweep which signals a rapid spread of a mutation (such as the new ASPM) through the population; this indicates that the mutation is somehow advantageous to the individual.

Testing the IQ of those with and without new ASPM allele has shown no difference in average IQ, providing no evidence to support the notion that the gene increases intelligence. 
Other genes related to brain development appear to have come under selective pressure in different populations. The DAB1 gene, involved in organizing cell layers in the cerebral cortex, shows evidence of a selective sweep in the Chinese. The SV2B gene, which encodes a synaptic vesicle protein, likewise shows evidence of a selective sweep in African-Americans.

<doc id="431437" wikidata="Q513737" url="?curid=431437" title="Hyūga Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of southeastern Kyūshū, corresponding to modern Miyazaki Prefecture Hyūga bordered on Ōsumi to the south, Higo to the west, and Bungo to the north. Its abbreviated form name was , although it was also called . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Hyūga was one of the provinces of the Saikaidō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Hyūga was ranked as one of the &quot;middle countries&quot; (中国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;far countries&quot; (遠国) in terms of distance from the capital. 

==History==
===Early history===
Ruins from the Japanese Paleolithic period have been discovered in the Hyūga area, and red-colored pottery made from cinnabar has been excavated from the Tsukahara ruins from the Jōmon period. The Hyūga region of the Yayoi period is characterized by the lack of bronze tools and the presence of gouged square stone knives, while imported ironware from the central Kyushu region have been unearthed. Many stories about Hyūga during this period appear in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, particularly in the early &quot;Age of the Gods&quot; period in which the descendants of the &quot;kami&quot;, including Amaterasu, Amenohoakari, Hikohohodemi, Hoderi and others, descended on the peak of Takachiho, bringing to the primitive inhabitants the secrets of rice cultivation, metals working and advanced fishing and agricultural technologies, which later spread from this area to the Kinai region.

It is also noteworthy that Emperor Jimmu departed from Hyūga on his expedition to conquer what later became Yamato although ancient texts and mythology remain vague as to whether or not he was originally the ruler of Hyūga. During the Kofun period, influences of culture from the Asian continent became stronger and from the 4th century, burial mounds similar to those found in the Kinai region began to appear in the area, including the Saitobaru Kofun Cluster. In the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Hyūga is called the “land of the Kumaso” (熊曽国) of Tsukushi-no-shima (Kyushu), which is named along with the provinces of Tsukushi, Toyo and Hi. The Kumaso people were subjugated either by Yamato Takeru or his father Emperor Keikō. Also according to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Emperor Keiko&#x27;s son, Prince Toyokuni was appointed Hyūga &quot;Kuni no miyatsuko&quot; in the reign of Emperor Ojin].

The existence of &quot;kofun&quot; clusters indicates that there was a political relationship between the local rulers and the Yamato Kingdom before the Asuka period. However, even into the Nara period the exact status of the area vis-a-vis Yamato remains unclear. In the time of Emperor Suiko, horses from Hyūga were famous with the court. The name “ Hyūga Province” appears in an article dated September 28, 698, in the second year of Emperor Monmu’s reign in the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot;, but it is unclear when this country was established, and with the establishment of the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system from the end of the 7th century, Hyūga initially included what later became Satsuma Province and Ōsumi Province. In 702, Satsuma was separated from Hyūga, followed by Ōsumi in 713. However, the local Hayato tribes of the area rebelled four times between the end of the 7th century and the early 8th century, which indicates that rule by Yamato was tenuous during this period. This cumulated in the Hayato rebellion of 720-721. The &quot;Hyūga-no-kuni Fudoki&quot; was compiled in the first half of the 8th century by Fujiwara no Umakai, who may have visited the area in person. 

The provincial capital during the Nara and Heian period was located in Koyu District, but the exact location is uncertain. It is presumed to be the Terasaki ruins, in what is now the city of Saito, but this identification is uncertain. The &quot;kokubun-ji&quot; of the province was the Hyūga Kokubun-ji, which was also located in Saito. The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Tsuno Shrine, located in Tsuno, Miyazaki, and the &quot;sōja&quot; of the province is the Tsuma Shrine, located in Miyazaki city. Per the &quot;Engishiki&quot; records of the mid-Heian period, only four shrines are listed, all of which were classified as &quot;minor&quot;.

In 1185, Tadahisa Koremune, possibly an illegitimate son of Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed to the position of &quot;jitō&quot; of Shimazu-shō (a large &quot;shōen&quot; estate located in southern Kyushu) belonging to the Konoe family. He took the name of &quot;Shimazu&quot; and his clan would rule southern Kyushu for the next 800 years. In 1197, Tadahisa was appointed as the &quot;shugo&quot; of Hyūga, along with Satsuma and Ōsumi. However, in 1203, Tadahisa was reduced to only Satsuma Province, and Hyūga was passed on to the Hōjō clan; although Usa Hachiman-gu controlled the entire northern area of Hyūga. In the Nanboku-chō period, the area had devolved into numerous semi-independent feudal estates with constantly shifting loyalties between the Northern Court and the Southern Court, with Hyūga as a battleground between the Ōtomo clan from Bungo in the north, the Shimazu clan in the south, and the Itō clan ruling from Obi in the center. However, in 1587, following Hideyoshi&#x27;s iconquest of Kyūshū, the Shimazu clan surrendered, and Hyūga Province was divided among the feudal lords who had distinguished themselves under Hideyoshi.

===Edo Period and early modern period===
Unlike many of the provinces of Kyūshū, Hyūga was not dominated by a single &quot;daimyō&quot;; rather, it was divided into &quot;tenryō&quot; territory directly governed by the Tokugawa shogunate and a few small domains. In addition, Satsuma Domain and Hitoyoshi Domain had many scattered holdings, especially in the southern and western parts of the province.

Following the Meiji restoration, each of the feudal domains briefly became prefectures. In December 1871, the area roughly north of the Ōyodo River became Mimisu Prefecture, and areas to the south became Miyakonojō Prefecture. On January 15, 1873 the two prefectures were merged to form Miyazaki Prefecture. However, Miyazaki Prefecture was merged with Kagoshima Prefecture on August 21, 1876, but was reconstituted as Miyazaki Prefecture again on May 9, 1883, excluding some border areas which remained with Kagoshima. Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation&#x27;s resources, the province had 377 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 417,393 &quot;koku&quot;. Hyūga Province consisted of:

<text>Jerry Irwin Mander (May 1, 1936 – April 11, 2023) was an American activist and author in San Francisco, known for his use of advertising for progressive and ecological causes and for his 1978 book, &quot;Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Mander was born in the Bronx, New York City, and raised in Yonkers, one of two children of Harry Mander, a garment worker who later started a company manufacturing clothing linings, and his wife Eva. Both of his parents were Jewish immigrants who had left Poland and Romania, respectively, to escape persecution. 

Mander originally aspired to be a professional golfer. He graduated from Lincoln High School in 1953, and then earned a B.S. in economics from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1957, and an M.S. in international economics from Columbia University in 1959.

==Career==
After working for a short time in public relations for Worthington Corporation in Newark, New Jersey, in 1960 Mander moved to San Francisco, where he was hired as a publicist for the San Francisco International Film Festival. He also co-promoted the psychedelic Trips Festival in 1966; worked for the modern dancer Anna Halprin, accompanying her on a European tour as her manager; and with Ernest Callenbach, founded the first art-house cinema in San Francisco. In 1966, he joined Howard Gossage&#x27;s advertising agency, which became Freeman, Mander &amp; Gossage after Mander became a partner. Clients included the comedy troupes the Committee, for whom Mander ran a full-page ad in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; announcing a competition to donate war toys to be air-dropped on the Pentagon, and Firesign Theater. After Gossage&#x27;s death in 1969, the firm broke up and Mander became independent. He co-founded Public Interest Communications to assist individuals and nonprofits, then joined the Public Media Center, where he remained for 20 years as a senior fellow.

In 1966, while at Freeman &amp; Gossage, Mander created an ad campaign for the Sierra Club that is largely credited with stopping a U.S. Government plan to dam the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon in order to raise the level of the river and to generate hydropower. Mander&#x27;s newspaper ads, with headlines like &quot;Should We Also Flood the Sistine Chapel So Tourists Can Get Nearer the Ceiling?&quot; and &quot;Now Only You Can Save Grand Canyon From Being Flooded ... For Profit&quot;, included coupons for readers to clip and mail to the President and the Secretary of the Interior. The Sierra Club remained a client; another was Planned Parenthood, for whom he created a 1985 abortion rights campaign that also included coupons for readers to mail to officials, in addition to photos of two women with their accounts of obtaining illegal abortions,and of a firebombed abortion clinic. His last major campaign, the &quot;Turning Point Project&quot; for the Foundation for Deep Ecology, encompassed 25 weekly full-page ads in the &quot;New York Times&quot; on a range of ecological topics. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; called him &quot;the Ralph Nader of advertising. 

Mander was program director at the Foundation for Deep Ecology, and in 1994 founded the International Forum on Globalization, a multi-national think tank in counterpoint to the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement that held sold-out teach-ins and launched the anti-corporatist movement. He served as its executive director until 2009, when he became a Distinguished Fellow. In 2007, he appeared in the documentary film &quot;What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire&quot;.

Mander published eight non-fiction books, the best known being &quot;Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television&quot; in 1978, in which he argued that television paves the way for autocracy by isolating viewers and dulling their minds. In 2022 he published a memoir through the prism of his advertising work for transformative causes, &quot;70 Ads to Save the World&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
In 1965, Mander married feminist author Anica Vesel. They had two sons, Kai and Yari. They divorced in 1982; she died in 2002. He remarried in 1987 to Elizabeth Garsonnin, a filmmaker and colleague at the Public Media Center, from whom he was also divorced, and in 2009 to Koohan Paik, also a filmmaker. They split their time between his longtime home in Bolinas, California, and her home in Hawaii.

Mander died at home in Kukuihaele, Hawaii, on April 11, 2023, at the age of 86. According to family, the cause was prostate cancer.

<text>Mandarin Airlines () is a Taiwanese regional airline based in Taipei, Taiwan, whose parent company is China Airlines. The airline operates domestic and regional international flights, while its parent company focuses on international operations. Some charter services are also operated by the company. Its main bases are Songshan Airport, Taichung International Airport and Kaohsiung International Airport.

==History==
Mandarin Airlines was established on 1 June 1991, and was initially a joint venture by China Airlines (67%) and Koos Group (33%); the Chinese name of the company is formed by the combination of the two. The establishment of Mandarin Airlines is closely related to the political status of Taiwan. At the time, Mandarin Airlines&#x27; parent company, China Airlines, still served as the flag carrier of the Republic of China, with the flag of the Republic of China a part of its livery. Denying the existence of the Taipei government, the People&#x27;s Republic of China hence attempted to boycott the international presence of China Airlines, using trade barriers to achieve its political goal. However, PRC&#x27;s objection did not extend to other Taiwanese carriers not carrying the ROC flag. As a way to work around these limits, Mandarin Airlines was founded while China Airlines maintained its role as the flag carrier.

On 16 October 1991, Mandarin Airlines started operations with direct flights from Taipei to Sydney in Australia. The next step was the opening of a direct air route to Vancouver in Canada on 7 December 1991. Thus, Mandarin Airlines became Taiwan&#x27;s first airline to fly direct to Australia and Canada. The China Trust Group pulled its investment in Mandarin Airlines on 31 October 1992, turning the airline into a company virtually wholly owned by China Airlines (90.05%) by December 1992. Also, Mandarin Airlines&#x27; role was changed to that of a primary domestic and short-range intra-regional airline, after parent China Airlines was able to re-establish its emphasis on international routes, due to a new livery that did not include the national flag, and thus faced less objection from the PRC.

On 8 August 1999, China Airlines formally merged its subsidiary, Mandarin Airlines, with Formosa Airlines under the Mandarin name. Mandarin took over Formosa&#x27;s domestic operations and aircraft while Mandarin&#x27;s fleet and most of its international flights were transferred to China Airlines. In early 2000, the airline bought 5 Dornier 228 from Uni Air to fly outlying routes. These planes were sold to Daily Air in 2005, a helicopter carrier in Taiwan which had won the bid to fly these money-losing routes.

Mandarin Airlines is owned by China Airlines (93.99%) and has 630 employees (as of March 2007).

===Fleet development===

Mandarin Airlines&#x27; E-190&#x27;s featured a refreshed livery, with the first aircraft delivered in May 2007, becoming the first, and to date the only, Taiwanese airline to use this type of aircraft. On 27 October 2009, Mandarin Airlines retired its last Fokker 100 aircraft, ending this type&#x27;s 14-year service with the airline. On 19 July 2017 Mandarin Airlines placed orders for six ATR 72-600 aircraft to be delivered in 2018.

==Accidents and incidents==
As 2024, Mandarin Airlines was involved in two incidents with no hull loss and fatalities. One McDonnell Douglas MD-11 wore Mandarin Airlines&#x27; livery crashed while landing at Hong Kong International Airport on August 22, 1999, resulting in three fatalities, but it was withdrawn from Mandarin Airlines three months before the crash and operated by China Airlines upon the crash.

*On December 6, 2006, Mandarin Airlines Flight 1261 flew from Taipei to Kinmen. After a normal landing at Jinmen Airport, it was found that a wheel of the front landing gear had fallen off. Later, the wheel was found next to the runway of Songshan Airport. There were no casualties.

*On 17 August 2012, Mandarin Airlines Flight 369 experienced a runway excursion during heavy rain due to improper landing and deceleration technique on runway 20 at Magong Airport. The E-190 aircraft was intentionally steered off the side of the runway and struck the base of four concrete runway lights, causing the nose gear to collapse. No injuries were reported.

<text>Beilby Porteus (or Porteous; 8 May 1731 – 13 May 1809), successively Bishop of Chester and of London, was a Church of England reformer and a leading abolitionist in England. He was the first Anglican in a position of authority to seriously challenge the Church&#x27;s position on slavery.

==Early life==
Porteus was born in York on 8 May 1731, the youngest of the 19 children of Elizabeth Jennings and Robert Porteus (&quot;d&quot;. 1758/9), a planter. Although the family was of Scottish ancestry, his parents were Virginian planters who had returned to England in 1720 as a result of the economic difficulties in the province and for the sake of his father&#x27;s health. Educated briefly at St Peter&#x27;s School, York and later at Ripon Grammar School, he was a classics scholar at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, becoming a fellow in 1752. In 1759 he won the Seatonian Prize for his poem &quot;Death: A Poetical Essay&quot;, a work for which he is still remembered.

He was ordained as a priest in 1757, and in 1762 was appointed as domestic chaplain to Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, acting as his personal assistant at Lambeth Palace for six years. It was during these years that it is thought he became more aware of the conditions of the enslaved Africans in the American colonies and the British West Indies. He corresponded with clergy and missionaries, receiving reports on the appalling conditions facing the slaves from Revd James Ramsay in the West Indies and from Granville Sharp, the English lawyer who had supported the cases of freed slaves in England.

In 1769 Beilby Porteus was appointed as chaplain to King George III. He is listed as one of the lenten preachers at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall in 1771, 1773 and 1774. He was also Rector of Lambeth (a living shared between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Crown) from 1767 to 1777, and later Master of St Cross, Winchester (1776–77).

He was concerned about trends within the Church of England towards what he regarded as the watering-down of the truth of Scripture and stood for doctrinal purity and opposed the anti-subscription movement, composed of theologians and scholars who, as he saw it, would have watered down cardinal Christian doctrines and beliefs and were also in favour of allowing clergy the option of subscribing to the Thirty-Nine Articles. At the same time he was prepared to suggest a compromise of a revision to some of the Articles. Always a Church of England man, he was, however, happy to work with Methodists and dissenters and recognised their major contributions in evangelism and education.

He was married to Margaret Hodgson. There is no record of them having any children.

==Bishop of Chester==

In 1776, Porteus was nominated as Bishop of Chester, taking up the appointment in 1777. He lost no time in getting to grips with the problems of a diocese which had a vastly growing population within the many new centres of the Industrial Revolution, most of which were in the north-west of England, but where there were the fewest parishes. The appalling poverty and deprivation amongst the immigrant workers in new manufacturing industries represented a huge challenge to the church, resulting in vast pressure upon the parish resources. He continued to take a deep interest in the plight of West Indian slaves, preaching and campaigning actively against the slave trade and taking part in many debates in the House of Lords, becoming known as a noted abolitionist. He took a particular interest in the affairs of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, especially regarding the Church of England&#x27;s role in the administration of the Codrington Plantations in Barbados, where around 300 slaves were owned by the Society.

Renowned as a scholar and a popular preacher, it was in 1783 that the young bishop was to first come to national attention by preaching his most famous and influential sermon.

==Anniversary sermon==
Porteus used the opportunity afforded by the invitation to preach the 1783 Anniversary Sermon of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts to criticise the Church of England&#x27;s role in ignoring the plight of the 350 slaves on its Codrington Plantations in Barbados and to recommend means by which the lot of slaves there could be improved.

It was an impassioned and well-reasoned plea for &quot;The Civilisation, Improvement and Conversion of the Negroe Slaves in the British West-India Islands Recommended&quot; and was preached at the church of St Mary-le-Bow before forty members of the society, including eleven bishops of the Church of England. When this largely fell upon deaf ears, Porteus next began work on his &quot;Plan for the Effectual Conversion of the Slaves of the Codrington Estate&quot;, which he presented to the SPG committee in 1784 and, when it was turned down, again in 1789. His dismay at the rejection of his plan by the other bishops is palpable. His diary entry for the day reveals his moral outrage at the decision and at what he saw as the apparent complacency of the bishops and the committee of the society at its responsibility for the welfare of its own slaves.

These were the first challenges to the establishment in an eventual 26-year campaign to eradicate slavery in the British West Indian colonies. Porteus made a huge contribution and eventually turned to other means of achieving his aims, including writing, encouraging political initiatives, and supporting the sending of mission workers to Barbados and Jamaica. Deeply concerned about the lot of the slaves as a result of the reports he received, Porteus became a committed and passionate abolitionist, the most senior cleric of his day to take an active part in the campaign against slavery. He became involved with the group of abolitionists at Teston in Kent, led by Sir Charles Middleton, and soon became acquainted with William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, Henry Thornton, Zachary Macaulay and other committed activists. Many of this group were members of the so-called Clapham Sect of evangelical social reformers and Porteus willingly lent his support to them and their campaigns.

As Wilberforce&#x27;s bill for the abolition of the slave trade was brought before the British parliament time and time again over 18 years from 1789, Porteus campaigned vigorously and energetically supported the campaign from within the Church of England and the bench of bishops in the House of Lords.

==Bishop of London==
In 1787, Porteus was translated to the bishopric of London on the advice of Prime Minister William Pitt, a position he held until his death in 1809. As is customary, he was also appointed to the Privy Council, and Dean of the Chapel Royal. In 1788, he supported Sir William Dolben&#x27;s Slave Trade Bill from the bench of bishops, and over the next quarter century he became the leading advocate within the Church of England for the abolition of slavery, lending support to such men as Wilberforce, Granville Sharp, Henry Thornton and Zachary Macaulay to secure the eventual passage of the Slave Trade Act in 1807.

In view of his passionate involvement in the anti-slavery movement and his friendship with other leading abolitionists, it was especially appropriate that, as Bishop of London, he should now find himself with official responsibility for the spiritual welfare of the British colonies overseas. He was responsible for missions to the West Indies, as well as to India, and towards the end of his life personally funded the sending of scriptures in the language of many peoples as far apart as Greenland and India.

A man of strong moral principle, Porteus was also passionately concerned about what he saw as the moral decay in the nation during the 18th century, and campaigned against trends which he saw as contributory factors, such as pleasure gardens, theatres and the non-observance of the Lord&#x27;s Day. He enlisted the support of his friend Hannah More, former dramatist and bluestocking, to write tracts against the wickedness of the immorality and licentious behaviour which were common at these events. He vigorously opposed the spread of the principles of the French Revolution as well as what he regarded as the ungodly and dangerous doctrines of Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;. In 1793, at Porteus&#x27; suggestion, Hannah More published &quot;Village Politics&quot;, a short pamphlet designed to counter the arguments of Paine, the first in a whole series of popular tracts designed to oppose what they saw as the prevailing immorality of the day.

==Other reforms==

During much of the following 20 years – a time of national and international political upheaval, Porteus was in a position to influence opinion in the influential circles of the Court, the government, the City of London and the highest echelons of Georgian society. Porteus did this, partly by encouraging debate on subjects as diverse as the slave trade, Catholic emancipation, the pay and conditions of low-paid clergy, the perceived excesses of entertainment taking place on Sundays—and by becoming a vocal supporter of William Wilberforce, Hannah More and the Clapham Sect of evangelical social reformers. He was also appointed as one of the members of the Board for Encouragement of Agriculture and internal Improvement in 1793. He was active in the establishment of Sunday Schools in every parish, an early patron of the Church Missionary Society and one of the founder members of the British and Foreign Bible Society, of which he became vice-president.

He was a well-known and passionate advocate of personal Bible-reading and even gave his name to a system of daily devotions using the &quot;Porteusian Bible&quot;, published after his death, highlighting the most important and useful passages; and was responsible for the new innovation of the use of tracts by church organisations. Always a Church of England man, Porteus was, however, happy to work with Methodists and dissenters and recognised their major contributions in evangelism and education.

In 1788, George III had again lapsed into one of his periods of mental derangement (now diagnosed as manic depression) to national concern. The following year, a Service of Thanksgiving for his recovery was held in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, at which Porteus himself preached.

The war against Napoleon began in 1794 and was to drag on for another 20 years. Porteus&#x27; tenure as Bishop of London saw not only services of thanksgiving for British victories at the Battles of Cape St. Vincent, the Nile and Copenhagen, but the great national outpouring of sorrow at the death of Nelson in 1805, and his state funeral service in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1806. As Bishop of London, Porteus may have officiated at some of these services, although it is unlikely that he did so at Nelson&#x27;s funeral, because of the Admiral&#x27;s reputation as an adulterer.

After a gradual decline in his health over the previous three years, Bishop Porteus died at Fulham Palace in 1809 and, according to his wishes, was buried at St Mary&#x27;s church, Sundridge in Kent – a stone&#x27;s throw from his country retreat in the village – a place to which he had loved to retire every autumn.

==Legacy==
Beilby Porteus was one of the most significant, albeit under-rated church figures of the 18th century. His sermons continued to be read by many, and his legacy as a foremost abolitionist was such that his name was almost as well known in the early 19th century as those of Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson – but a 100 years later he had become one of the &#x27;forgotten abolitionists&#x27;, and today his role has largely been ignored and his name has been consigned to the footnotes of history. His primary claim to fame in the 21st century is for his poem on &quot;Death&quot; and, possibly unfairly, as the supposed prototype for the pompous Mr Collins in Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

But it is ironic that Porteus&#x27; most lasting contribution was one for which he is little-known, the Sunday Observance Act 1780 (21 Geo. 3. c. 49) (a response to what he saw as the moral decay of England), which legislated the ways in which the public were allowed to spend their recreation time at weekends for the following 200 years, until the passage of the Sunday Trading Act 1994 (c. 20).

His legacy lives on, though, in the fact that the campaign which he helped to set in motion eventually led to the transformation of the Church of England into an international movement with mission and social justice at its heart, appointing African, Indian and Afro-Caribbean bishops and archbishops and others from many diverse ethnic groups as its leaders.

<text>was a province of Japan which consisted of the Iki Islands, now a part of modern Nagasaki Prefecture. Its abbreviated name was . Iki is classified as one of the provinces of the Saikaidō. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Iki was ranked as an &quot;inferior country&quot; (下国) and a &quot;far country&quot; (遠国).

==History==
The Iki Islands have been inhabited since the Japanese Paleolithic era, and numerous artifacts from the Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun periods have been found by archaeologists, indicating continuous human occupation and activity. In the Chinese &quot;Weizhi Worenchuan&quot; (Japanese 魏志倭人伝, &quot;Gishi Wajinden&quot;), part of the Records of the Three Kingdoms dating from the 3rd century AD, mention is made of a country called &quot;Ikikoku&quot;, (一支国), located on an archipelago east of the Korean Peninsula. Archaeologists have tentatively identified this with the large Yayoi period settlement of (原の辻), one of the largest to have been discovered in Japan, where artifacts uncovered indicate a close contact with the Japanese islands and the Asian mainland. It is also mentioned in the &quot;Weilüe,&quot; the &quot;Book of Liang&quot; and the &quot;Book of Sui.&quot;

The islands were organized as Iki Province under the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; reforms in the latter half of the seventh century, and the name &quot;Iki-no-kuni&quot; appears on wooden markers found in the imperial capital of Nara.

The exact location of the provincial capital is not known, but is traditionally believed to have been in the former town of Ashibe, in former Ishida District. where the ruins of the &quot;Kokubun-ji&quot; of Iki Province have been discovered. Two shrines vie for the title of &quot;Ichinomiya&quot; of the province: the , in former town of Gonoura and the , in Ashibe
After the abolition of the han system in July 1871, Iki Province became part of &quot;Hirado Prefecture&quot; from 1871, which then became part of Nagasaki Prefecture.
