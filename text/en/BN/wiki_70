<text>Robert Lang (born December 19, 1970) is a Czech former professional ice hockey player. Selected by the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the fifth round, 133rd overall, of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, Lang made his NHL debut with the team in the 1992–93 season. He has also played for the Boston Bruins, Pittsburgh Penguins, Washington Capitals, Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, Montreal Canadiens and Phoenix Coyotes, with whom he retired with in 2010.

Internationally, Lang played for both the Czechoslovak and Czech national teams, competing in four Winter Olympics (winning gold in 1998), three Ice Hockey World Championships and two World Cups.

==Playing career==
A native of Czechoslovakia, Lang began his career in the Czechoslovak Extraliga as an eighteen-year-old with HC Litvínov. After scoring 15 points in 32 games in 1989–90, his second season with HC Litvínov, he was drafted 133rd overall by the Los Angeles Kings in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft.

Lang returned to play another two seasons in the Extraliga before debuting with the Kings in 1992–93. He played the majority of his first two seasons in the International Hockey League (IHL) with the Kings&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Phoenix Roadrunners.

Due to the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, Lang returned to HC Litvínov (now of the Czech Extraliga) for 16 games, scoring 23 points. When NHL play resumed, he landed a full-time roster spot with the Kings. He tallied 22 points in 68 games in 1995–96 before returning to the Czech Extraliga to play for Sparta Praha.

After a brief hiatus from the NHL, Lang returned after one season in Europe, joining the Pittsburgh Penguins as a free agent on September 2, 1997. He was subsequently bounced back and forth between the Penguins and Boston Bruins for a couple of months before he stuck with the Penguins.

Lang remained with the Penguins, joining fellow Czech Jaromír Jágr and increasing his points total in each of his first four seasons with the team. In 2000–01, he scored a career-high 32 goals, 48 assists and 80 points in 82 games. That season, the Penguins reached the Eastern Conference Finals, but were defeated in five games by the New Jersey Devils. Lang added eight points in 16 playoff games.

After the 2001–02 season, Lang became an unrestricted free agent and signed with the Washington Capitals. In Washington, he was re-united with Jágr, who had been traded to the Capitals the year before. He scored 69 points in his first season with Washington, second in team scoring to Jágr.

During the 2003–04 season, Lang was enjoying another career year and recorded his first career hat-trick on November 12, 2003. He was leading the NHL in scoring when he was traded to the Stanley Cup-contending Detroit Red Wings for prospect Tomáš Fleischmann, a first-round draft pick (Mike Green) in 2004 and a fourth-round pick in 2006. This marked the first time in NHL history that a player was traded while leading the NHL in points. Shortly after the trade, he was sidelined with a broken rib on March 8. Missing 13 games, he surrendered the NHL scoring lead to the Tampa Bay Lightning&#x27;s Martin St. Louis and finished with 79 points in 69 games, one point shy of his career-high set in 2000–01 and ninth overall in the League. (Lang&#x27;s points-per-game of 1.14 was identical to St. Louis&#x27;.) Lang returned to the Red Wings in time for the 2004 playoffs, but the team was eliminated by the Calgary Flames in the second round. He recorded a career-high nine points in 12 playoff games.

In addition to Lang&#x27;s ninth-place finish in NHL scoring, he had participated in his first NHL All-Star in 2004 and was also awarded the Golden Hockey Stick as the top Czech hockey player at the end of the season.

Lang remained with the Red Wings until the end of the 2006–07 season, but his production dipped each of his remaining campaign in Detroit. Before signing a two-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks as an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, Lang embarked on another playoff run with the Red Wings in 2007, but they were halted by the eventual Stanley Cup champions Anaheim Ducks in the semifinals. Lang recorded eight points in 18 playoff games.

In Chicago, Lang recorded 54 points playing behind rookie standouts Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane; Lang finished fourth in team scoring. After just one season with the Blackhawks, he was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for a second-round draft pick in 2010 (previously acquired from the Toronto Maple Leafs) on September 12, 2008.

Lang recorded a natural hat-trick, the second three-goal effort of his career, in his first season with the Canadiens, against the New York Rangers on January 7, 2009, in a 6–3 win. He scored his three goals on the power play, even-strength and short-handed in an empty net. Having played 50 straight games for the Canadiens, leading them in goal scoring, power play points and second on the team in overall points, Lang suffered an achilles tendon injury, sidelining him for the remainder of the regular season.

On September 29, 2009, Lang was signed by the Phoenix Coyotes to a one-year contract, just days before the start of the 2009–10 season. During the season, Lang recorded 29 points in 64 regular season games while missing the last 17 games of the regular season due to a lower-body injury. His offensive contribution and veteran leadership helped lead the Coyotes to their first playoff berth since the 2001–02 season. The Coyotes were defeated by the Red Wings in seven games in the first round of the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs. Lang played in four of the seven games, recording one assist.

==International play==





Lang debuted internationally with Czechoslovakia in the 1992 Winter Olympics. Lang scored 13 points in eight games, third in tournament scoring, as Czechoslovakia defeated the United States in the bronze medal game. That same year, Lang competed for Czechoslovakia in the 1992 World Championships, held in his home country. Scoring four points in eight games, Lang captured his second bronze medal with Czechoslovakia.

In 1996, Lang competed with the recently-independent Czech Republic in his second World Championships and won the country&#x27;s first gold medal at the tournament (Czechoslovakia had won six times previously). Lang scored nine points in eight games. Later that year, Lang competed in the inaugural World Cup (replacing the Canada Cup), however the Czechs lost all three round-robin games and did not advance to the medal rounds. Lang failed to register a point.

The following year, Lang competed in the 1997 World Championships, defeating Russia in the bronze medal game. Lang scored two points in eight games.

In 1998, Lang competed in his second Winter Olympics, capturing gold on a team with Dominik Hašek and Pittsburgh Penguins teammate Jaromír Jágr. He scored two points in six games as the Czechs defeated Canada in the semifinals, then Russia in the final.

Four years later, Lang once again suited up for the Czechs in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Lang scored three points in four games, but the Czechs were kept from defending their gold medal, falling to Russia in the quarterfinals.

In 2004, Lang saw his only hockey action of the 2004–05 season at the World Cup due to the NHL lockout. The Czechs were defeated 4–3 in overtime in the semifinals against Canada.

Competing in his fourth Olympics, Lang tallied four assists in eight games as team captain in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin as the Czechs returned to the Olympic medal podium, capturing bronze against Russia. It would prove to be his last Olympics, as, at the age of 39, he would not be invited back for a fifth turn during the 2010 Winter Olympics, despite still playing in the NHL. The Czechs finished fifth, failing to reach the medal podium.

==Personal life==
Former Detroit Red Wings teammate (and fellow Czech) Jiří Hudler spent time living in Lang&#x27;s home as Lang took him under his wing during his time in Detroit. Lang refers to Hudler as his &quot;third son.&quot;

Lang resides in San Diego, California, with his wife Jennifer. The couple have two sons, Kelly and Brooks.

<text>Elizabeth Short (July 29, 1924 – , 1947), known as the Black Dahlia, was an American woman found murdered in the Leimert Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, on January 15, 1947. Her case became highly publicized owing to the gruesome nature of the crime, which included the mutilation and bisection of her corpse.

A native of Boston, Short spent her early life in New England and Florida before relocating to California, where her father lived. It is commonly held that she was an aspiring actress, though she had no known acting credits or jobs during her time in Los Angeles. Short acquired the nickname of the Black Dahlia posthumously, as newspapers of the period often nicknamed particularly lurid crimes; the term may have originated from the film noir thriller &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; (1946). After the discovery of her body, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) began an extensive investigation that produced over 150 suspects but yielded no arrests.

Short&#x27;s unsolved murder and the details surrounding it have had a lasting cultural impact, generating various theories and public speculation. Her life and death have been the basis of numerous books and films, and her murder is frequently cited as one of the most famous unsolved murders in U.S. history, as well as one of the oldest unsolved cases in Los Angeles County. It has likewise been credited by historians as one of the first major crimes in postwar America to capture national attention.

==Life==
===Childhood===
Elizabeth Short was born on July 29, 1924, in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, the third of five daughters to Cleo Alvin Short Jr. (October 18, 1885 – January 19, 1967) and his wife, Phoebe May Sawyer (July 2, 1897 – March 1, 1992). Her sisters were Virginia May West (born 1920), Dorothea Schloesser (born 1922), Elnora Chalmers (born 1925) and Muriel Short (born 1929). Short&#x27;s father was a United States Navy sailor from Gloucester Courthouse, Virginia, while her mother was a native of Milbridge, Maine. The Shorts were married in Portland, Maine, in 1918. The Short family briefly relocated to Portland in 1927, before settling in Medford, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, that same year. 

Short&#x27;s father built miniature golf courses until he lost most of his savings in the 1929 stock market crash. In 1930, his car was found abandoned on the Charlestown Bridge, and it was assumed that he had jumped into the Charles River. Believing her husband to be deceased, Short&#x27;s mother began working as a bookkeeper to support the family. Troubled by bronchitis and severe asthma attacks, Short underwent lung surgery at age 15, after which doctors suggested she periodically relocate to a milder climate to prevent further respiratory problems. Her mother sent her to spend winters with family friends in Miami, Florida, for the next three years. Short dropped out of Medford High School during her sophomore year.

===Relocation to California===

In late 1942, Short&#x27;s mother received a letter of apology from her presumed-deceased husband, which revealed that he was in fact alive and had started a new life in California. In December of that year, at age 18, Short relocated to Vallejo, California, to live with her father, whom she had not seen since age 6. At the time her father was working at the nearby Mare Island Naval Shipyard on San Francisco Bay. Arguments between Short and her father led to her moving out in January 1943.

Short took a job at the Base Exchange at Camp Cooke (now Vandenberg Space Force Base) near Lompoc, California, briefly living with a United States Army Air Force sergeant who reportedly abused her. She left Lompoc in mid-1943 and moved to Santa Barbara, where she was arrested on September 23 for drinking at a local bar while underage. Juvenile authorities sent her back to Massachusetts, but she returned instead to Florida, making only occasional visits to her family near Boston.

While in Florida, Short met Major Matthew Michael Gordon Jr., a decorated Army Air Force officer of the 2nd Air Commando Group, who was training for deployment to Southeast Asian theater of World War II. Short later told friends that Gordon had written to propose marriage while he was recovering from injuries from a plane crash in India. She accepted his offer, but Gordon died in a second crash on August 10, 1945. Short&#x27;s sister Dorothea also served in the war and was assigned to decode Japanese messages.

In July 1946, Short relocated to Los Angeles to visit Army Air Force Lieutenant Joseph Gordon Fickling, an acquaintance from Florida, who was stationed at the Naval Reserve Air Base in Long Beach. Short spent the last six months of her life in southern California, mostly in the Los Angeles area; shortly before her death she had been working as a waitress and rented a room behind the Florentine Gardens nightclub on Hollywood Boulevard. Short has been variously described and depicted as an aspiring or &quot;would-be&quot; actress. According to some sources, she did in fact have aspirations to be a film star, though she had no known acting jobs or credits.

==Murder==
===Prior activities===
On January 9, 1947, Short returned to her home in Los Angeles after a brief trip to San Diego with Robert &quot;Red&quot; Manley, a 25-year-old married salesman she had been dating. Manley stated that he dropped Short off at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, and that Short was to meet one of her sisters, who was visiting from Boston, that afternoon. By some accounts, staff of the Biltmore recalled having seen Short using the lobby telephone. Shortly after, she was allegedly seen by patrons of the Crown Grill Cocktail Lounge at 754 South Olive Street, approximately away from the Biltmore.

===Discovery===
On the morning of January 15, 1947, Short&#x27;s naked body, severed into two pieces, was found in a vacant lot on the west side of South Norton Avenue, midway between Coliseum Street and West 39th Street (at ) in the neighborhood of Leimert Park, which was largely undeveloped at the time.

Short&#x27;s severely mutilated body was completely severed at the waist and drained of blood, leaving her skin a pallid white. Medical examiners determined that she had been dead for around ten hours prior to the discovery, leaving her time of death either sometime during the evening of January 14 or the early morning hours of January 15. The body had apparently been washed by the killer. Short&#x27;s face had been slashed from the corners of her mouth to her ears, creating an effect known as the &quot;Glasgow smile&quot;. She had several cuts on her thigh and breasts, where entire portions of flesh had been sliced away. The lower half of her body was positioned a foot away from the upper, and her intestines had been tucked neatly beneath her buttocks. The corpse had been &quot;posed&quot;, with her hands over her head, her elbows bent at right angles, and her legs spread apart.

&quot;Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot; reporter Aggie Underwood was among the first to arrive at the crime scene, and took several photos of Short&#x27;s body and its surroundings. Near the body, detectives located a heel print on the ground amid the tire tracks, and a cement sack containing watery blood was also found nearby.

===Autopsy and identification===
An autopsy of Short&#x27;s body was performed on January 16, 1947, by Frederick Newbarr, the Los Angeles County coroner. Newbarr&#x27;s autopsy report stated that Short was tall, weighed and had light blue eyes, brown hair and badly decayed teeth. There were ligature marks on her ankles, wrists and neck, and an &quot;irregular laceration with superficial tissue loss&quot; on her right breast. Newbarr also noted superficial lacerations on the right forearm, left upper arm and the lower left side of the chest.
Short&#x27;s body had been cut completely in half by a technique taught in the 1930s called a hemicorporectomy. The lower half of her body had been removed by transecting the lumbar spine between the second and third lumbar vertebrae, thus severing the intestine at the duodenum. Newbarr&#x27;s report noted &quot;very little&quot; ecchymosis (bruising) along the incision line, suggesting it had been performed after death. Another &quot;gaping laceration&quot; measuring long ran longitudinally from the umbilicus to the suprapubic region. The lacerations on each side of the face, which extended from the corners of the lips, were measured at on the right side of the face, and on the left. The skull was not fractured, but there was bruising noted on the front and right side of her scalp, with a small amount of bleeding in the subarachnoid space on the right side, consistent with blows to the head. The cause of death was determined to be hemorrhaging from the lacerations to her face and the shock from blows to the head and face. Newbarr noted that Short&#x27;s anal canal was dilated at , suggesting that she might have been raped. Samples were taken from her body testing for the presence of sperm, but the results came back negative.

Short was identified after her fingerprints were sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); her fingerprints were on file from her 1943 arrest. Immediately following the identification, reporters from William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; contacted her mother, Phoebe Short, in Boston, and told her that her daughter had won a beauty contest. It was only after prying as much personal information as they could from Phoebe that the reporters revealed that her daughter had in fact been murdered. The &quot;Examiner&quot; also offered to pay Phoebe&#x27;s airfare and accommodations if she would travel to Los Angeles to help with the police investigation; that was yet another ploy since the newspaper kept her away from police and other reporters to protect its scoop. The &quot;Examiner&quot; and another Hearst newspaper, the &quot;Herald-Express&quot;, later sensationalized the case, with one &quot;Examiner&quot; article describing the black tailored suit Short was last seen wearing as &quot;a tight skirt and a sheer blouse.&quot; The media nicknamed her the &quot;Black Dahlia&quot;, and described her as an &quot;adventuress&quot; who &quot;prowled Hollywood Boulevard.&quot; Additional newspaper reports, such as one published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on January 17, deemed the murder a &quot;sex fiend slaying.&quot;

==Investigation==
===Initial investigation===
====Letters and interviews====
On January 21, a person claiming to be Short&#x27;s killer placed a phone call to the office of James Richardson, the editor of the &quot;Examiner&quot;, congratulating Richardson on the newspaper&#x27;s coverage of the case and stating he planned on eventually turning himself in, but not before allowing police to pursue him further. Additionally, the caller told Richardson to &quot;expect some souvenirs of Beth Short in the mail.&quot;

Three days later, a suspicious manila envelope was discovered, addressed to &quot;The &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; and other Los Angeles papers,&quot; with individual words that had been cut-and-pasted from newspaper clippings; additionally, a large message on the face of the envelope read: &quot;Here is Dahlia&#x27;s belongings [,] letter to follow.&quot; The envelope contained Short&#x27;s birth certificate, business cards, photographs, names written on pieces of paper and an address book with the name Mark Hansen embossed on the cover. The packet had been carefully cleaned with gasoline, similarly to Short&#x27;s body, which led police to suspect the packet had been sent directly by her killer. Despite efforts to clean the packet, several partial fingerprints were lifted from the envelope and sent to the FBI for testing; however, the prints were compromised in transit and thus could not be properly analyzed. The same day the packet was received by the &quot;Examiner&quot;, a handbag and a black suede shoe were reported to have been seen on top of a garbage can in an alley a short distance from Norton Avenue, from the crime scene. The items were recovered by police but had also been wiped clean with gasoline, destroying any fingerprints.

On March 14, an apparent suicide note scrawled in pencil on a bit of paper was found tucked in a shoe in a pile of men&#x27;s clothing by the ocean&#x27;s edge at the foot of Breeze Avenue in Venice. The note read: &quot;To whom it may concern: I have waited for the police to capture me for the Black Dahlia killing, but have not. I am too much of a coward to turn myself in, so this is the best way out for me. I couldn&#x27;t help myself for that, or this. Sorry, Mary.&quot; The pile of clothing was first seen by a beach caretaker, who reported the discovery to lifeguard captain John Dillon. Dillon immediately notified Captain L. E. Christensen of West Los Angeles police station. The clothes included a coat and trousers of blue herringbone tweed, a brown and white T-shirt, white jockey shorts, tan socks and tan moccasin leisure shoes, size about eight. The clothes gave no clue about the identity of their owner.

Police quickly deemed Mark Hansen, the owner of the address book found in the packet, a suspect. Hansen was a wealthy local nightclub and theater owner and an acquaintance at whose home Short had stayed with friends. According to some sources, Hansen also confirmed that the purse and shoe discovered in the alley were in fact Short&#x27;s. Ann Toth, Short&#x27;s friend and roommate, told investigators that Short had recently rejected sexual advances from Hansen, and suggested it as potential motive for him to kill her; however, Hansen was cleared of suspicion in the case. In addition to Hansen, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) interviewed over 150 men in the ensuing weeks whom they believed to be potential suspects. Robert Manley, who had been one of the last people to see Short alive, was also investigated, but was cleared of suspicion after passing numerous polygraph examinations. Police also interviewed several persons found listed in Hansen&#x27;s address book, including Martin Lewis, who had been an acquaintance of Short&#x27;s. Lewis was able to provide an alibi for the date of Short&#x27;s murder, as he was in Portland, Oregon, visiting his dying father-in-law.

A total of 750 investigators from the LAPD and other departments worked on the Short case during its initial stages, including 400 sheriff&#x27;s deputies and 250 California State Patrol officers. Various locations were searched for potential evidence, including storm drains throughout Los Angeles, abandoned structures and various sites along the Los Angeles River, but the searches yielded no further evidence. Los Angeles City Councilman Lloyd G. Davis posted a reward for information leading police to Short&#x27;s killer. After the announcement of the reward, various persons came forward with confessions, most of which police dismissed as false. Several of the false confessors were charged with obstruction of justice.

====Media response; decline====
On January 26, another letter was received by the &quot;Examiner&quot;, this time handwritten, which read: &quot;Here it is. Turning in Wed., Jan. 29, 10 am. Had my fun at police. Black Dahlia Avenger.&quot; The letter also named a location at which the supposed killer would turn himself in. Police waited at the location on the morning of January 29, but the alleged killer did not appear. Instead, at 1:00pm, the &quot;Examiner&quot; offices received another cut-and-pasted letter which read: &quot;Have changed my mind. You would not give me a square deal. Dahlia killing was justified.&quot;

The graphic nature of the murder and the subsequent letters received by the &quot;Examiner&quot; had resulted in a media circus surrounding Short&#x27;s murder. Both local and national publications heavily covered the story, many of which reprinted sensationalistic reports suggesting that Short had been tortured for hours prior to her death; the information, however, was false, yet police allowed the reports to circulate so as to conceal Short&#x27;s true cause of death—cerebral hemorrhage—from the public. Further reports about Short&#x27;s personal life were publicized, including details about her alleged declining of Hansen&#x27;s sexual advances; additionally, a stripper who was an acquaintance of Short&#x27;s told police that she &quot;liked to get guys worked up over her, but she&#x27;d leave them hanging dry.&quot; This led some reporters (namely the &quot;Herald-Express&quot;″s Bevo Means) and detectives to look into the possibility that Short was a lesbian, and begin questioning employees and patrons of gay bars in Los Angeles; this claim, however, remained unsubstantiated. The &quot;Herald-Express&quot; also received several letters from the purported killer, again made with cut-and-pasted clippings, one of which read: &quot;I will give up on Dahlia killing if I get 10 years. Don&#x27;t try to find me.&quot;

On February 1, the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; reported that the case had &quot;run into a Stone Wall,&quot; with no new leads for investigators to pursue. The &quot;Examiner&quot; continued to run stories on the murder and the investigation, which was front-page news for thirty-five days following the discovery of the body.

When interviewed, lead investigator Captain Jack Donahue told the press that he believed Short&#x27;s murder had taken place in a remote building or shack on the outskirts of Los Angeles, and that her body transported to the location where it was disposed of. Based on the precise cuts and dissection of Short&#x27;s body, the LAPD looked into the possibility that the murderer had been a surgeon, doctor or someone with medical knowledge. In mid-February 1947, the LAPD served a warrant to the University of Southern California Medical School, which was located near the site where the body had been discovered, requesting a complete list of the program&#x27;s students. The university agreed so long as the students&#x27; identities remained private. Background checks were conducted but yielded no results.

===Grand jury and aftermath===
By the spring of 1947, Short&#x27;s murder had become a cold case with few new leads. Sergeant Finis Brown, one of the lead detectives on the case, blamed the press for compromising the investigation through journalists&#x27; probing of details and unverified reporting. In September 1949, a grand jury convened to discuss inadequacies in the LAPD&#x27;s homicide unit based on their failure to solve numerous murders—especially those of women and children—in the previous several years, Short&#x27;s being one of them. In the aftermath of the grand jury, further investigation was done on Short&#x27;s past, with detectives tracing her movements between Massachusetts, California and Florida, and also interviewed people who knew Short in Texas and New Orleans. However, the interviews yielded no useful information in the murder.

==Suspects and confessions==

The notoriety of Short&#x27;s murder has spurred a large number of confessions over the years, many of which have been deemed false. During the initial investigation, police received a total of sixty confessions, most made by men. Since that time, over 500 people have confessed to the crime, some of whom had not even been born at the time of her death. Sergeant John P. St. John, an LAPD detective who worked the case until his retirement, stated, &quot;It is amazing how many people offer up a relative as the killer.&quot;

In 2003, Ralph Asdel, one of the original detectives on the case, told the &quot;Times&quot; that he believed he had interviewed Short&#x27;s killer, a man who had been seen with his sedan parked near the crime scene in the early morning hours of January 15, 1947. A neighbor driving by that day stopped to dispose of a bag of lawn clippings in the lot when he saw a parked sedan, allegedly with its right rear door open; the driver of the sedan was standing in the lot. His arrival apparently startled the owner of the sedan, who approached his car and peered in the window before returning to the sedan and driving away. The owner of the sedan was followed to a local restaurant where he worked, but was ultimately cleared of suspicion.

Suspects remaining under discussion by various authors and experts include a doctor named Walter Bayley, proposed by former &quot;Times&quot; copyeditor Larry Harnisch; &quot;Times&quot; publisher Norman Chandler, whom biographer Donald Wolfe claims impregnated Short; Leslie Dillon, Joseph A. Dumais, Artie Lane, Mark Hansen, Francis E. Sweeney, Woody Guthrie, Bugsy Siegel, Orson Welles, George Hodel, Hodel&#x27;s friend Fred Sexton, George Knowlton, Robert M. &quot;Red&quot; Manley, Patrick S. O&#x27;Reilly, and Jack Anderson Wilson.

Although he was never formally charged in the crime, George Hodel came to wider attention after his death when he was accused by his son, LAPD homicide detective Steve Hodel, of killing Short and committing several additional murders. Prior to the Dahlia case, George Hodel was suspected, but not charged, in the death of his secretary, Ruth Spaulding; and was accused of raping his own daughter, Tamar, but acquitted. Hodel fled the country several times and lived in the Philippines between 1950 and 1990. Additionally, Steve Hodel has cited his father&#x27;s training as a surgeon as circumstantial evidence. In 2003, it was revealed in notes from the 1949 grand jury report that investigators had wiretapped George Hodel&#x27;s home and obtained recorded conversation of him with an unidentified visitor, saying: &quot;Supposin&#x27; I did kill the Black Dahlia. They couldn&#x27;t prove it now. They can&#x27;t talk to my secretary because she&#x27;s dead. They thought there was something fishy. Anyway, now they may have figured it out. Killed her. Maybe I did kill my secretary.&quot;

In 1991, Janice Knowlton, who was aged 10 at the time of Short&#x27;s murder, claimed that she witnessed her father, George Knowlton, beat Short to death with a claw hammer in the detached garage of her family&#x27;s home in Westminster. She also published a book titled &quot;Daddy was the Black Dahlia Killer&quot; in 1995, in which she made additional claims that her father sexually abused her. The book was condemned as &quot;trash&quot; by Knowlton&#x27;s stepsister, Jolane Emerson, who stated: &quot;She believed it, but it wasn&#x27;t reality. I know, because I lived with her father for sixteen years.&quot; Additionally, St. John told the &quot;Times&quot; that Knowlton&#x27;s claims were &quot;not consistent with the facts of the case.&quot;

The 2017 book &quot;Black Dahlia, Red Rose&quot; by Piu Eatwell focuses on Leslie Dillon, a bellhop who was a former mortician&#x27;s assistant; his associates Mark Hansen and Jeff Connors; and Sergeant Finis Brown, a lead detective who had links to Hansen and was allegedly corrupt. Eatwell posits that Short was murdered because she knew too much about the men&#x27;s involvement in a scheme for robbing hotels. She further suggests that Short was killed at the Aster Motel in Los Angeles, where the owners reported finding one of their rooms &quot;covered in blood and fecal matter&quot; on the morning Short&#x27;s body was found. The &quot;Examiner&quot; stated in 1949 that LAPD chief William A. Worton denied that the Aster Motel had anything to do with the case, although its rival newspaper, the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot;, claimed that the murder took place there.

In 2000, Buz Williams, a retired detective with the Long Beach Police Department, wrote an article for the LBPD newsletter &quot;The Rap Sheet&quot; on Short&#x27;s murder. His father, Richard F. Williams, was a member of the LAPD&#x27;s Gangster Squad investigating the case. Williams&#x27; father reportedly believed that Dillon was the killer, and that when Dillon returned to his home state of Oklahoma he was able to avoid extradition to California because his ex-wife Georgia Stevenson was second cousins with Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson II, who contacted the governor of Oklahoma on Dillon&#x27;s behalf. Williams&#x27; article claimed that Dillon sued the LAPD for $3 million, but that the suit was dropped. Harnisch disputes this, stating that Dillon was cleared by police after an exhaustive investigation and that the district attorney&#x27;s files positively placed him in San Francisco when Short was killed. Harnisch claims that there was no LAPD coverup, and that Dillon did in fact receive a financial settlement from the City of Los Angeles, but has not produced concrete evidence to prove this.

==Theories and potentially related crimes==
===Cleveland Torso Murders===

Several crime authors, as well as police detective Peter Merylo, have suspected a link between the Short murder and the Cleveland Torso Murders, which took place in Cleveland, Ohio, between 1934 and 1938. As part of their investigation into other murders that took place before and after the Short killing, the original LAPD investigators studied the Torso Murders in 1947 but later discounted any connection between the two cases. In 1980, new evidence implicating a former Torso Murder suspect, Jack Anderson Wilson, was investigated by St. John in relation to Short&#x27;s murder. He claimed he was close to arresting Wilson in Short&#x27;s murder, but that Wilson died in a fire on February 4, 1982. The possible connection to the Torso Murders received renewed media attention when it was profiled on the NBC series &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; in 1992, in which Eliot Ness biographer Oscar Fraley suggested Ness knew the identity of the killer responsible for both cases.

===Lipstick Murders===
Crime authors such as Steve Hodel and William Rasmussen have suggested a link between the Short murder and the 1946 murder and dismemberment of 6-year-old Suzanne Degnan in Chicago, Illinois. Captain Donahoe of the LAPD stated publicly that he believed the Black Dahlia and the &quot;Lipstick Murders&quot; in Chicago were &quot;likely connected.&quot; Among the evidence cited is the fact that Short&#x27;s body was found on Norton Avenue, three blocks west of Degnan Boulevard, Degnan being the last name of the girl from Chicago. There were also striking similarities between the handwriting on the Degnan ransom note and that of the &quot;Black Dahlia Avenger.&quot; Both texts used a combination of capitals and small letters (the Degnan note read in part &quot;BuRN This FoR heR SAfTY&quot; ), and both notes contain a similar misshapen letter P and have one word that matches exactly. Convicted serial killer William Heirens served life in prison for Degnan&#x27;s murder. Initially arrested at age 17 for breaking into a residence close to that of Degnan, Heirens claimed he was tortured by police, forced to confess and made a scapegoat for the murder. After being taken from the medical infirmary at the Dixon Correctional Center on February 26, 2012, for health problems, Heirens died at the University of Illinois Medical Center on March 5, 2012, at age 83.

===Lone Woman Murders===
Between 1943 and 1949, over a dozen unsolved murders occurred in Los Angeles which involved the sexual mutilation of young attractive women. Authorities suspected at the time that they could have been the work of a single unidentified serial killer. In 1949, a Los Angeles County grand jury was tasked with investigating the failure on the part of law enforcement to solve the cases. As a result, further investigation was done on the homicides although none of them were solved.

* On July 27, 1943, the son of a greenskeeper discovered the nude body of 41-year-old Ora Elizabeth Murray lying on the ground near the parking lot of the Fox Hills Golf Course. Murray had been severely beaten about her face and body, and the autopsy determined that her cause of death was due to &quot;constriction of the larynx by strangulation&quot;. Murray was last seen on July 26, 1943, attending a dance at the Zenda Ballroom in downtown Los Angeles with her sister before leaving with an unidentified man. Her murder remains unsolved.
* John Gilmore&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;&quot;, suggests a possible connection between Short&#x27;s murder and that of 20-year-old Georgette Bauerdorf. At 11 a.m. on October 12, 1944, Bauerdorf&#x27;s maid and a janitor arrived to clean her apartment in West Hollywood where they found her body face down in her bathtub. It is believed that Bauerdorf was attacked by a man who was waiting inside the apartment for her. Gilmore suggests that Short&#x27;s employment at the Hollywood Canteen, where Bauerdorf also worked as a hostess, could be a potential connection between the two women. However, the claim that Short ever worked at the Hollywood Canteen has been disputed by other sources, such as the retired &quot;Times&quot; copy-editor Larry Harnisch. Regardless, Steve Hodel has still suggested that both women were killed by the same individual since in both cases the media received notes supposedly from the killer taunting the police and boasting of his skills.
* The murder of 44-year-old Jeanne &quot;Nettie&quot; French on February 10, 1947, was also considered by the media and detectives as possibly being related to Short&#x27;s killing. French&#x27;s body was discovered in West Los Angeles on Grand View Boulevard, nude and badly beaten. Written on her stomach in lipstick was what appeared to say &quot;Fuck You B.D.&quot; and the letters &quot;TEX&quot; below. The &quot;Herald-Express&quot; covered the story heavily and drew comparisons to the Short murder less than a month prior, surmising the initials &quot;B.D.&quot; stood for &quot;Black Dahlia&quot;. According to historian Jon Lewis, however, the scrawling actually read &quot;P.D.&quot;, ostensibly standing for &quot;police department.&quot;
* On March 12, 1947, the nude body of 43-year-old Evelyn Winters was found at 12:10 a.m. in a vacant lot of an abandoned rail yard in Norwalk, California, along the Los Angeles River. Winters had been bludgeoned and strangled to death. She was last seen by a male acquaintance, James Joseph Tiernan, who stated to authorities that he saw her leave the Albany Hotel in Los Angeles at 8:00 p.m. 
* Dorothy Ella Montgomery, aged 36, was found at about 10:30 a.m. in a vacant field on May 4, 1947, under a pepper tree in Florence-Graham, California. Montgomery had died due to strangulation and was found nude and beaten. She had been missing since 9:30 p.m. the previous evening when she had left her home to pick up her daughter at a dance recital.
* On May 12, 1947, the body of 39-year-old Laura Eliza Trelstad was discovered by an oil company patrolman in an oil field on Long Beach Boulevard. Trelstad had been sexually assaulted, strangled with a belt and then thrown from a moving vehicle. According to her husband, they had both been playing cards the night prior at their home in 2211 Locust Avenue, Long Beach, with friends in the late afternoon. Trelstad&#x27;s husband wanted to continue; but she had become bored and left to go to the Crystal Ballroom. She stated: &quot;If the boys can play poker, we girls can go dance.&quot; She was not seen alive again. 
* On July 8, 1947, the naked body of Rosenda Josephine Mondragon, aged 21, was discovered by a postal clerk in a gutter near Los Angeles City Hall. Mondragon had been strangled by a silk stocking. She was last seen by her estranged husband that morning, at 1 a.m., when he had been served by her with divorce papers at his residence. She then left entering a stranger&#x27;s car. 
* On the evening of October 2, 1947, Lillian Dominguez, aged 15, was walking home with her sister and a friend in Santa Monica, when a man approached them and proceeded to stab Dominguez in the heart with a stiletto blade, between her second and third ribs. One week later, on October 9, a note on the back of a business card was left under the door of a furniture store. The message was written in pencil and read: &quot;I killed the Santa Monica Girl, I will kill others.&quot;
* On February 14, 1948, 42-year-old Gladys Eugenia Kern, a Los Angeles real estate agent, was found stabbed in the back with a hunting knife in a vacant house that she was showing in the Los Feliz district at 4217 Cromwell Avenue. That afternoon Kern was last seen with an unidentified man at the counter of a nearby drugstore. The murderer had stolen her appointment book and had cleaned the murder weapon before he left.
* Cosmetologist Louise Margaret Springer, aged 35, was found murdered on June 13, 1949, in the backseat of her husband&#x27;s convertible sedan alongside a street in South Central Los Angeles. She had been garroted with a length of clothesline that had been knotted and a stick had been inserted into her anus. Springer&#x27;s husband notified law enforcement of her disappearance that evening when he returned from an errand inside her shop to find both Springer and his vehicle missing.
* Mimi Boomhower, aged 48, was last heard from when she telephoned a friend from her home in the 700 block of Nimes Road in Los Angeles on August 18, 1949. Between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m., the call ended. Five days after she vanished, Boomhower&#x27;s white handbag was discovered in a phonebooth at a grocery store in Los Angeles. Boomhower was never heard from again, and she was later declared legally dead.
* On the evening of October 7, 1949, 26-year-old Jean Spangler left her home in Los Angeles, telling her sister-in-law that she was going to meet with her ex-husband before going to work as an extra on a film set. She was last seen alive at a grocery store several blocks from her home at approximately 6:00 p.m. Two days later, Spangler&#x27;s tattered purse was discovered in a remote area of Griffith Park, approximately from her home; inside was a letter addressed to a &quot;Kirk,&quot; which mentioned seeing a doctor.

==Rumors and factual disputes==
Numerous details regarding Short&#x27;s personal life and death have been points of public dispute. The eager involvement of both the public and press in solving her murder have been credited as factors that complicated the investigation significantly, resulting in a complex, sometimes inconsistent narrative of events. According to Anne Marie DiStefano of the &quot;Portland Tribune&quot;, many &quot;unsubstantiated stories&quot; have circulated about Short over the years: &quot;She was a prostitute, she was frigid, she was pregnant, she was a lesbian. And somehow, instead of fading away over time, the legend of the Black Dahlia just keeps getting more convoluted.&quot; Harnisch has refuted several supposed rumors and popular conceptions about Short and also disputed the validity of Gilmore&#x27;s book &quot;Severed&quot;, claiming the book is &quot;25% mistakes, and 50% fiction.&quot; Harnisch had examined the district attorney&#x27;s files (he claimed that Steve Hodel has examined some of them pertaining to his father, along with &quot;Times&quot; columnist Steve Lopez) and contrary to Eatwell&#x27;s claims, the files showed that Dillon was thoroughly investigated and was determined to have been in San Francisco when Short was killed. Harnisch speculated that Eatwell either did not find these files or she chose to ignore them.

===Murder and state of the body===
A number of people, none of whom knew Short, contacted police and newspapers claiming to have seen her during her so-called &quot;missing week,&quot; between her January 9 disappearance and the discovery of her body, on January 15. Police and district attorney&#x27;s investigators ruled out each alleged sighting; in some cases, those interviewed were identifying other women whom they had mistaken for Short. Short&#x27;s whereabouts in the days leading up to her murder and the discovery of her body are unknown.

After the discovery of Short&#x27;s body, numerous Los Angeles newspapers printed headlines claiming she had been tortured leading up to her death. This was denied by law enforcement at the time, but they allowed the claims to circulate so as to keep Short&#x27;s actual cause of death a secret from the public. Some sources, such as Oliver Cyriax&#x27;s &quot;Crime: An Encyclopedia&quot; (1993), state that Short&#x27;s body was covered in cigarette burns inflicted on her while she was still alive, though there is no indication of this in her official autopsy report.

In &quot;Severed&quot;, Gilmore states that the coroner who performed Short&#x27;s autopsy suggested in conversation that she had been forced to consume feces based on his findings when examining the contents of her stomach. This claim has been denied by Harnisch and is also not indicated in Short&#x27;s official autopsy, though it has been reprinted in several print and online media.

===Nickname===

According to newspaper reports shortly after the murder, Short received the nickname &quot;Black Dahlia&quot; from staff and patrons at a Long Beach drugstore in mid-1946 as wordplay on the film &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; (1946). Other popularly-circulated rumors claim that the media crafted the name because Short adorned her hair with dahlias. According to the FBI&#x27;s official website, Short received the first part of the nickname from the press &quot;for her rumored penchant for sheer black clothes.&quot;

However, reports by district attorney&#x27;s investigators state that the nickname was invented by newspaper reporters covering her murder; &quot;Herald-Express&quot; reporter Bevo Means, who interviewed Short&#x27;s acquaintances at the drugstore, has been credited with first using the &quot;Black Dahlia&quot; name, though reporters Underwood and Jack Smith have been alternatively named as its creators. While some sources claim that Short was referred to or went by the name during her life, others dispute this. Both Gilmore and Harnisch agree that the name originated during Short&#x27;s lifetime and was not a creation of the press: Harnisch states that it was in fact a nickname she earned from the staff of the Long Beach drugstore she frequented; in &quot;Severed&quot;, Gilmore names an A.L. Landers as the proprietor of the drugstore, though he does not provide the store&#x27;s name. Prior to the circulation of the &quot;Black Dahlia&quot; name, Short&#x27;s killing had been dubbed the &quot;Werewolf Murder&quot; by the &quot;Herald-Express&quot; because of the brutal nature of the crime.

===Alleged prostitution and sexual history===
Many true crime books claim that Short lived in or visited Los Angeles at various times in the mid-1940s, including Gilmore&#x27;s &quot;Severed&quot;, which claims she worked at the Hollywood Canteen. This is disputed by Harnisch, who states that Short did not, in fact, live in Los Angeles until after the canteen&#x27;s closing in 1945. Although some of Short&#x27;s acquaintances and several commentators described Short as a prostitute or call girl during her time in Los Angeles, according to Harnisch, the contemporaneous grand jury proved that there was no existing evidence that she was ever a prostitute. Harnisch claims that the rumor regarding Short&#x27;s history as a prostitute originates from John Gregory Dunne&#x27;s 1977 novel &quot;True Confessions&quot;, which is based in part on the crime.

Another widely circulated rumor (sometimes used to counter claims that Short was a prostitute) holds that Short was unable to have sexual intercourse because of a congenital defect that resulted in gonadal dysgenesis, also known as &quot;infantile genitalia.&quot; Los Angeles County district attorney&#x27;s files state that the investigators had questioned three men with whom Short had engaged in sex, including a Chicago police officer who was a suspect in the case; FBI files on the case also contain a statement from one of Short&#x27;s alleged lovers. Short&#x27;s autopsy itself, which was reprinted in full in Michael Newton&#x27;s 2009 book &quot;The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes&quot;, notes that her uterus was &quot;small&quot;; however, no other information in the autopsy is provided that would suggest her reproductive organs were anything other than anatomically normal. The autopsy also states that Short was not and had never been pregnant, contrary to what had been claimed prior to and following her death.

Another rumor—that Short was a lesbian—has often circulated; according to Gilmore, this rumor began after Means was told by the deputy coroner that Short &quot;wasn&#x27;t having sex with men&quot; owing to her allegedly &quot;small&quot; genitalia. Means took this to mean that Short had sex with women, and both he and &quot;Herald-Express&quot; reporter Sid Hughes began fruitlessly investigating gay bars in Los Angeles for further information.

==Legacy==
Short is interred at the Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland. After her younger sister, Elnora, had grown up and married, their mother Phoebe moved to Oakland to be near her daughter&#x27;s grave. She finally returned to the East Coast in the 1970s, where she lived into her nineties and died in 1992. On February 2, 1947, just two weeks after Short&#x27;s murder, Republican state assemblyman C. Don Field was prompted by the case to introduce a bill calling for the formation of a sex offender registry; the state of California would become the first U.S. state to make the registration of sex offenders mandatory.

Short&#x27;s murder has been described as one of the most brutal and culturally enduring crimes in U.S. history, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed it as one of the most infamous unsolved cases in the world.

Short&#x27;s life and death have been the basis of numerous books, television shows and films, both fictionalized and non-fiction. Among the most famous fictional accounts of Short&#x27;s death is James Ellroy&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, which, in addition to the murder, explored &quot;the larger fields of politics, crime, corruption, and paranoia in post-war Los Angeles,&quot; according to cultural critic David M. Fine. Ellroy&#x27;s novel was adapted into a 2006 film of the same name by director Brian De Palma: Short was played by actress Mia Kirshner. Both Ellroy&#x27;s novel and its film adaptation bear little relation to the facts of the case. Michael Connelly&#x27;s 2024 novel &quot;The Waiting&quot; has a major subplot involving the Black Dahlia case.

Short was also portrayed in heavily fictionalized accounts by Lucie Arnaz in the 1975 television film &quot;Who Is the Black Dahlia?&quot;, by Jessica Nelson in Season Four, Episode 13 of &quot;Hunter&quot;, and by Mena Suvari in the series &quot;American Horror Story&quot; in 2011, featuring Short in the plot line of the episode &quot;Spooky Little Girl&quot;, and again in 2018 with &quot;Return to Murder House&quot;.

<doc id="440049" wikidata="Q2994219" url="?curid=440049" title="Council for the Development of French in Louisiana">
<text>The Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL; ) is Louisiana&#x27;s Office of Francophone Affairs (). It is a state agency whose multiple legislative mandates include developing opportunities to use the French language in tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations. CODOFIL is governed by a board of 23 members and administratively placed within the Louisiana Office of Cultural Development&#x27;s Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism, overseen by the Lieutenant Governor. CODOFIL is the only state agency in the United States whose purpose is to serve a linguistic population.

Today, CODOFIL&#x27;s role is to promote and support French immersion and French as a second language in education; it acts as a partner to the Louisiana Department of Education (LDOE), whose role is to manage Louisiana&#x27;s school districts. CODOFIL continues to recruit and sponsor French, Belgian and Canadian associate teachers as per its accords with those countries, who are placed alongside local teachers upon LDOE&#x27;s recommendation. CODOFIL encourages Louisiana Francophones to continue transmission of the state&#x27;s heritage language via its scholarship program (providing opportunities for pedagogical advancement) and the Escadrille Louisiane program (which allows non-native speakers to perfect French at the Université de Rennes in exchange for a minimum 3-year teaching commitment of French in Louisiana).

CODOFIL has also worked to instill pride in all Louisiana Francophones in their linguistic identity rather than to uphold one variety of French language or another.

==Mission and vision==
The Council for the Development of French in Louisiana&#x27;s mission is to &quot;work toward the creation of an eco-system that permits the development of French in the economic, educational, cultural and professional sectors and in which Louisiana&#x27;s French and Creole speakers are valorized in their cultural and linguistic identity.&quot; It seeks to &quot;provide access to economic, educational, cultural and professional opportunities in French to all Louisianians.&quot; CODOFIL endorses revitalization of the French language in Louisiana through French immersion programs in schools, and CODOFIL does this by inviting French-speaking teachers from French-speaking communities around the world to Louisiana. In order for schools to have teachers for the immersion program, schools must send requests for teachers to CODOFIL first, then CODOFIL select teachers from the list of applicants that fit with the schools&#x27; criteria for the immersion program and send them to teach the immersion programs there. CODOFIL also endorses the Cajun Music Festival as a way to promote Cajun culture through Cajun music and keep the Cajun tradition alive.

==Board==
CODOFIL originally consisted of a chairman and an advisory committee, all appointed by the governor of Louisiana. Today it is administered by a president, an executive director, and a board of as many as 23 non-paid directors. In addition to the governor, various Louisiana organizations nominate and select board members, who serve for a term of four years.

==History==
The Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) was established in 1968 to promote the preservation of French language and culture in Louisiana. The Louisiana state legislature has greatly shifted its stance on the status of French. Since the passage of Legislative Act No. 409 in 1968, the Louisiana governor is granted the authorization &quot;to establish the Council for the Development of Louisiana-French&quot; and that the agency is to consist of no more than fifty members, including a chairman. The name was soon changed to CODOFIL and was granted the power to &quot;do anything possible and necessary to encourage the development, usage and preservation of French as it exists in Louisiana&quot;.

James R. Domengeaux, a former state legislator and former United States Congressman of ethnic French descent, was the driving force behind CODOFIL&#x27;s creation. A semi-retired attorney at the time, Domengeaux began his crusade for restoring French in Louisiana after Senator Edgar G. &quot;Sonny&quot; Mouton, Jr., of Lafayette obtained passage of an &quot;urge-and-request&quot; resolution for Louisiana school boards to help reverse the decline of the use of the French language within the state. Domengeaux traveled around Louisiana to gain support for his campaign to make Louisiana a bilingual state through French language education. By the spring of 1968, Domengeaux had gained enough interest from the public and support from officials, to present his plan to the legislature. Legislators, such as J. Burton Angelle of Breaux Bridge voted to create CODOFIL, and the measure was signed into law in July 1968 by Governor John McKeithen. The law empowered CODOFIL to &quot;do any and all things necessary to accomplish the development, utilization, and preservation of the French language ... for the cultural, economic, and tourist[ic] benefit of the State.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Although CODOFIL aims to promote the French language and culture in Louisiana, this does not come without controversies among critics in Louisiana. A common criticism is that CODOFIL emphasizes education in Standard French over the local Louisiana French for economic purposes instead of cultural purposes. Critics claim that not only does CODOFIL attempt to homogenize the type of French dialect through inviting foreign Francophone teachers over relying on local French-speaking Cajuns and Creoles for the French language immersion program, CODOFIL also homogenizes French culture in Louisiana by prioritizing a Cajun identity over Creole identity when it comes to Louisiana&#x27;s Francophone identity. Despite this, a survey conducted on the French immersion program shows that a majority of the teachers in the immersion program support integration of Cajun culture and Louisiana French into the curriculum, with 69% saying yes to teaching Cajun or Louisiana French into the curriculum, and 72% for Franco-Louisianan cultural aspect relating to the Louisiana French language, although the issue still remains for Louisiana Creole, with 90% of the teachers in the survey say no to integrating Creole into the curriculum in contrast to Louisiana French. Another criticism of CODOFIL&#x27;s approach on cultural revival through festivals comes from critics such as the musician James Bau Graves, who view that CODOFIL commodifies Cajun culture through music festival and cultural activities and conserving it for tourism instead of preserving it. Graves views that the commercialization of Cajun culture prevents it from preserving because it hinders any attempts for the culture to adapt to the modern era, and homogenizes Cajun culture to a commodity. On the other hand, Barry Jean Ancelet views that the commercialization of Cajun culture allows more exposure to tourists and the international community. Ancelet views that exposure of Cajun culture to the outside allows appreciation from the international community and helps cultural preservation and revitalization possible by bolstering cultural pride and funding for the community.

<doc id="440050" wikidata="Q3076583" url="?curid=440050" title="December 1910 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The December 1910 United Kingdom general election was held from 3 to 19 December. It was the last general election to be held over several days and the last to be held before the First World War.

The election took place following the efforts of the Liberal government to pass its People&#x27;s Budget in 1909, which raised taxes on the wealthy to fund social welfare programmes. The 1909 budget was only agreed to by the House of Lords in April 1910 after the January general election in which the Liberals and the Irish Parliamentary Party gained a majority. The Government called a further election in December 1910 to get a mandate for the Parliament Act 1911, which would prevent the House of Lords from permanently blocking legislation linked to money bills ever again, and to obtain King George V&#x27;s agreement to threaten to create sufficient Liberal peers to pass that act (in the event this did not prove necessary, as the Lords voted to curtail their own powers).

The Conservative Party, led by Arthur Balfour with their Liberal Unionist allies, and the Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, almost exactly repeated the numerical result produced in the January election, with the Conservatives again winning the largest number of votes. The Liberal Party under Asquith remained in government with the support of the Irish Parliamentary Party. This was the last election in which the Liberals won the highest number of seats in the House of Commons. It was also the last United Kingdom general election in which a party other than Labour or the Conservatives won the most seats.

==Results==






===Voting summary===
===Seats summary===
== Aftermath ==
Both the Liberals and the Conservatives won 272 seats, however the Liberals remained the largest party due to the Speaker having been Conservative, meaning they sat with 271 MPs.

The Liberals, still lacking a parliamentary majority, again went into coalition with the Irish Parliamentary Party, who insisted on a Home Rule Bill as a condition of coalition.

<text>The January 1910 UK general election was held from 15 January to 10 February 1910. Called amid a constitutional crisis after the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected the People&#x27;s Budget, the Liberal government, seeking a mandate, lost their majority.

It was a hung parliament: Arthur Balfour’s Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won the most votes, but Asquith’s Liberals secured the most seats, edging out the Conservatives by two. With Irish Parliamentary Party support, Asquith remained in power. Another election followed in December.

The Labour Party, led by Arthur Henderson, returned 40 MPs. Much of this apparent increase (from the 29 Labour MPs elected in 1906) came from the defection, a few years earlier, of Lib Lab MPs from the Liberal Party to Labour.

<text>Wang Fanxi (; March 16, 1907 – December 30, 2002) was a leading Chinese Trotskyist revolutionary.

Born near Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, he joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), then an illegal organization, in 1925. In 1927, he went to Moscow to study at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. There he became a supporter of Trotsky and the International Left Opposition. On his return to China, Wang worked for the CCP and became a leading member of the Trotskyist October Group, and then the Chinese Left Opposition. He was jailed for most of the period from 1931 and 1937, and was expelled from the CCP for his views.

In 1941, the Chinese Left Opposition split and Wang and others formed the Communist League (Internationalist), which became the Internationalist Workers Party of China in 1949. That year, he was sent to Hong Kong to act as an international link for the group, but was soon exiled to Macau. He wrote extensively and remained an influential figure, aligned with the United Secretariat of the Fourth International. In 1975, he was forced to move again, and he emigrated to Leeds, England, where he died on December 30, 2002.

<text>The 1906 United Kingdom general election was held from 12 January to 8 February 1906. It&#x27;s dubbed as the &quot;Liberal landslide&quot;: the opposition Liberals under Henry Campbell-Bannerman won a landslide victory against a bewildered Conservative Party, in which it&#x27;s leader, Arthur Balfour lost his seat; the party won the fewest amount of seats it ever had in its history, a feat unsurpassed until 2024. This particular landslide is now ranked alongside the 1924, 1931, 1945, 1983, 1997, 2001, and 2024 general elections as one of the largest landslide election victories.

The Labour Representation Committee was far more successful than at the 1900 general election and after the election would be renamed the Labour Party with 29 MPs and Keir Hardie as leader. The Irish Parliamentary Party, led by John Redmond, achieved its seats with a relatively low number of votes, as 73 candidates stood unopposed. This election was a landslide defeat for the Conservative Party and their Liberal Unionist allies, with the primary reason given by historians being the party&#x27;s weakness after its split over the issue of free trade (Joseph Chamberlain had resigned from government in September 1903 in order to campaign for Tariff Reform, which would allow &quot;preferential tariffs&quot;). Many working-class people at the time saw this as a threat to the price of food, hence the debate was nicknamed &quot;Big Loaf, Little Loaf&quot;. The Liberals&#x27; landslide victory of 125 seats over all other parties led to the passing of social legislation known as the Liberal reforms.

This was the last general election in which the Liberals won an absolute majority in the House of Commons, the last general election in which neither Labour nor the Conservatives won the popular vote, and the only election held between 1886 and 1945 in which the Conservatives did not win the popular vote. It was also the last peacetime election held more than five years after the previous one prior to passage of the Parliament Act 1911, which limited the duration of Parliaments in peacetime to five years. In this election the Conservatives were reduced to their lowest seat count in the party&#x27;s history, a record not broken until 2024, 118 years later.
== Overview ==

A coalition between the Conservative and Liberal Unionist parties had governed the United Kingdom since the 1895 general election. Arthur Balfour had served as Prime Minister from 1902 until 5 December 1905, when he chose to resign over growing unpopularity. Instead of calling a general election, Balfour had hoped that under a Liberal government, splits would re-emerge; which would therefore help the Conservative Party achieve victory at the next general election.

The incoming Liberal government chose to capitalise on the Conservative government&#x27;s unpopularity and called an immediate general election one month later on 12 January 1906, which resulted in a crushing defeat for the Conservatives.

=== Conservative unpopularity ===

The Unionist government had become deeply divided over the issue of free trade, which soon became an electoral liability. This culminated in Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s resignation from the government in May 1903 to campaign for tariff reform in order to protect British industry from foreign competition. This division was in contrast to the Liberal Party&#x27;s belief in free trade, which it argued would help keep costs of living down.

The issue of free trade became the feature of the Liberal campaign, under the slogan &#x27;big loaf&#x27; under a Liberal government, &#x27;little loaf&#x27; under a Conservative government. It also commissioned a variety of posters warning the electorate over rises in food prices under protectionist policies, including one which mentioned that &quot;Balfour and Chamberlain are linked together against free trade ... Don&#x27;t be deceived by Tory tricks&quot;.

The Boer War had also contributed to the unpopularity of the Conservative and Unionist government. The war had lasted over two and half years, much longer than had originally been expected, while details were revealed of the existence of concentration camps where over 20,000 men, women and children were reported to have died because of poor sanitation.

The war had also unearthed the poor social state of the country in the early 1900s. This was after more than 40% of military recruits for the Boer War were declared unfit for military service; in Manchester, 8,000 of the 11,000 men who had been recruited had to be turned away for being in poor physical condition. This was after the 1902 Rowntree study of poverty in York showed that almost one-third of the population lived below the &#x27;poverty line&#x27;, which helped to increase the calls for social reforms, something which had been neglected by the Conservative and Unionist government.

The Conservative and Unionist Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour, had been blamed over the issue of &#x27;Chinese Slavery&#x27;, i.e. the use of Chinese-indentured labour in South Africa (see Chinese South Africans). This became controversial among the Conservative Party&#x27;s middle-class supporters, who saw it as unethical. The working-class also objected to the practice, as White emigration to South Africa could have created jobs for the unemployed in Britain.

Nonconformists were angered when Conservatives pushed through the Education Act 1902, which integrated voluntary schools into the state system and provided for their support from the local rate. The local school boards were abolished and replaced by local education authorities based on county or county borough councils. Worst of all, the Anglican schools, which were on the edge of bankruptcy would thus receive funding from local rates that everyone had to pay. One tactic was to refuse to pay local taxes. The school system played a major role in the Liberal victory in 1906, as Dissenter (nonconformist) Conservatives punished their old party and voted Liberal. However, the Liberals were conscious of the call to fair treatment their victory had in the counties and neither repealed or modified the 1902 law. Another issue which lost the Conservatives nonconformist votes was the Licensing Act 1904. Although the legislation aimed to reduce the number of public houses, it proposed to compensate brewers for the cancellation of their licence, through a fund the brewers themselves would have to pay into leading many who adhered to temperance to denounce it as a &quot;brewers&#x27; bill&quot;, and Brewers generally being dissatisfied.

According to historian Lawrence Goldman:
=== Notable results ===
The landslide Liberal victory led to many Conservative and Unionist MPs losing what had previously been regarded as safe seats. This resulted in prominent Conservative ministers being unseated including former Prime Minister Arthur Balfour. Only three of the Conservative cabinet which had served until December 1905 (one month before the election) held onto their seats, the outgoing: Home Secretary Aretas Akers-Douglas, Chancellor Austen Chamberlain (Liberal Unionist), Secretary of State for War H.O. Arnold-Forster who changed to that allied party before the election.

==== Manchester East ====
Arthur Balfour, who entered the general election as the Conservative Party leader and had until the month before been Prime Minister, unexpectedly lost his seat in the Manchester East constituency, a seat which he had represented since 1885. The result in Manchester East saw a large 22.4% swing to the Liberal candidate Thomas Gardner Horridge, much larger than the national 5.4% swing to the Liberals.

The Liberal candidate in Manchester East had been helped by a pact with the local Labour Party. Horridge said of his victory that &quot;East Manchester is essentially a Labour constituency and the great Labour party has supported my candidacy very thoroughly and very loyally&quot;. He also said that &quot;[Manchester East constituents] have returned me, I take it, first to uphold free trade, next to deal with Chinese labour, and after that to support legislation on the lines laid down in the programme of the Labour party, with which I am heartily in accord&quot;.

Balfour&#x27;s unseating became symbolic of the Conservative Party&#x27;s landslide defeat. The result has since been called one of the biggest upsets in British political history and remains a rare instance of a former Prime Minister or Leader of the Opposition losing their seat in a General election.

=== Gladstone–MacDonald pact ===

In 1903, the Liberal Herbert Gladstone and Ramsay MacDonald of the Labour Representation Committee negotiated an informal agreement to ensure the anti-Conservative vote was not split between their two parties. The Gladstone–MacDonald pact meant that, in 31 of the 50 seats where LRC candidates stood, the Liberal Party did not put up a candidate. This proved helpful to both parties, as 24 of LRC 29 elected MPs came from constituencies where the Liberal Party agreed not to contest, while the pact allowed the Liberals to concentrate resources on Conservative/Liberal marginal constituencies.

<text>The 1900 United Kingdom general election was held between 26 September and 24 October 1900, following the dissolution of Parliament on 25 September. Also referred to as the Khaki Election (the first of several elections to bear this sobriquet), it was held at a time when it was widely believed that the Second Boer War had effectively been won (though in fact it was to continue for another two years).

The Conservative Party, led by Lord Salisbury with their Liberal Unionist allies, secured a large majority of 134 seats, despite having received only 5.6% more votes than Henry Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s Liberals. This was largely owing to the Conservatives winning 163 seats that were uncontested by others. The Labour Representation Committee, later to become the Labour Party, participated in a general election for the first time. However, it had only been in existence for a few months; as a result, Keir Hardie and Richard Bell were the only LRC Members of Parliament elected in 1900.

This was the first occasion when Winston Churchill was elected to the House of Commons. He had stood in the same seat, Oldham, at a by-election held the previous year, but had lost. It was also the final general election of the Victorian era, as well as the last one where the leader of either of the two largest parties (and by extension, the incumbent Prime Minister) sat in the House of Lords rather than the House of Commons.

<doc id="440071" wikidata="Q7888019" url="?curid=440071" title="1895 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The 1895 United Kingdom general election was held from 13 July to 7 August 1895. The result was a Conservative parliamentary majority of 153.

William Gladstone had retired as prime minister the previous year, and Queen Victoria, disregarding Gladstone&#x27;s advice to name Lord Spencer as his successor, appointed the Earl of Rosebery as the new prime minister. Rosebery&#x27;s government found itself largely in a state of paralysis due to a power struggle between him and William Harcourt, the Liberal leader in the Commons. The situation came to a head on 21 June, when Parliament voted to dismiss Secretary of State for War Henry Campbell-Bannerman; Rosebery, realising that the government would likely not survive a motion of no confidence were one to be brought, promptly resigned as prime minister. Conservative leader Lord Salisbury was subsequently re-appointed for a third spell as prime minister, and promptly called a new election.

The election was won by the Conservatives, who continued their alliance with the Liberal Unionist Party and won a large majority. The Liberals, in contrast, went down to what at the time was their worst result since the party&#x27;s foundation, winning just 177 seats. The Irish Parliamentary Party was split at this time; most of its MPs (the &quot;Anti-Parnellites&quot;) followed John Dillon, while a rump (the &quot;Parnellites&quot;) followed John Redmond. The Independent Labour Party, having only previously existed as a loose grouping of left-wing politicians, formally organized into a party led by Keir Hardie in 1893 and contested their first election. They earned relatively little attention at this election, winning slightly less than one per cent of the popular vote and no seats, but would enjoy greater success five years later, when they ran under the banner of the Labour Representation Committee.

This was the last United Kingdom general election where neither the incumbent prime minister nor leader of the main opposition party sat in the House of Commons, with Rosebery and Salisbury both sitting in the House of Lords, and William Harcourt and Arthur Balfour respectively acting as the Commons leaders for the Liberals and Conservatives.

<text>This is a list of members of Parliament (MPs) elected in the 1983 general election, held on 9 June. This Parliament was dissolved in 1987.

During 1983–1987 Bernard Weatherill was the speaker, Margaret Thatcher served as Prime Minister, Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock served as Leaders of the Opposition.

==Composition==
These representative diagrams show the composition of the parties in the 1983 general election.

Note: The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru sit together as a party group, while Sinn Féin has not taken its seats. This is not the official seating plan of the House of Commons, which has five rows of benches on each side, with the government party to the right of the speaker and opposition parties to the left, but with room for only around two-thirds of MPs to sit at any one time.



==By-elections==
See the list of United Kingdom by-elections.

Two seats were vacant when Parliament was dissolved preparatory to the 1987 general election:
*Kirkcaldy – Harry Gourlay (Lab) died 20 April 1987
*Lewisham, Deptford – John Silkin (Lab) died 26 April 1987

<doc id="440075" wikidata="Q3544113" url="?curid=440075" title="Castlederg">
<text>Castlederg (earlier Caslanadergy, ) is a town in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It lies on the River Derg and is near the border with County Donegal, Ireland. It stands in the townlands of Castlesessagh and Churchtown, in the historic barony of Omagh West and the civil parish of Urney. The village has a ruined castle and two ancient tombs known as the Druid&#x27;s Altar and Todd&#x27;s Den. It had a population of 2,980 people at the 2021 census.

The village hosts some of the district&#x27;s key events each year, including the Derg Vintage Rally, Dergfest music festival, Red River Festival and the traditional Apple Fair.

Castlederg was a traveller&#x27;s stop along the ancient pilgrimage route to Station Island on Lough Derg. The town boasts ancient ruins and monastic settlements.

== History ==
===Early history===
Historically the area around the town was a site of contestation between the territories of Cenél nEógain (later Tír Eoghain) and Connail (later Tír Chonaill – mostly modern County Donegal). This rivalry between the two powers continued until the 16th century when they combined in the defence of Ulster against the encroaching Elizabethan armies. The Castlederg area, lying within the new barony of Omagh, was granted to the English Attorney-General for Ireland, Sir John Davies. Two castles were constructed on his proportion, Castle Curlews (Kirlish Castle) outside Drumquin and Derg Castle, the ruins of which can be seen today on the northern bank of the River Derg at Castlederg. A bronze-age cauldron was found at Castlederg in 2011.

===The Troubles===
During the Troubles, 25 people were killed in and around Castlederg (including Killeter and Killen) and there were many bombings in the village. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) killed 11 members of the Ulster Defence Regiment and Royal Ulster Constabulary, four fellow IRA members whom it accused of being informers, and three Ulster Protestant civilians. Four IRA members were also killed when their bombs exploded prematurely. Ulster loyalist paramilitaries killed three Catholic civilians.

==Transport==
The narrow-gauge Castlederg and Victoria Bridge Tramway was built in 1883, to link the village with the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) at Victoria Bridge. Castlederg railway station opened on 4 July 1884, but was finally closed on 17 April 1933.

== Demography ==

===19th century population===
The population of the village increased during the 19th century:

===2011 Census===
Castlederg is classified as an intermediate settlement by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e. with a population between 2,500 and 4,999 people).
On Census Day (27 March 2011) the usually resident population of Castlederg Settlement was 2,976, accounting for 0.16% of the NI total. Of these:

<doc id="440076" wikidata="Q301018" url="?curid=440076" title="Hourglass dolphin">
<text>The hourglass dolphin (Lagenorhynchus cruciger) is a small dolphin in the family Delphinidae that inhabits offshore Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters. It is commonly seen from ships crossing the Drake Passage but has a circumpolar distribution.

The species was identified as a new species by Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824 from a drawing made in the South Pacific in 1820. It is the only cetacean to have been widely accepted as a species solely on witness accounts. 

==Description==

The hourglass dolphin is colored black on top and white on the belly, with white patches on the sides and sometimes variations of dark grey. For this reason, it was colloquially known by whalers as a &quot;sea cow&quot; (although it does not belong to the taxonomic order Sirenia) or &quot;sea skunk&quot;. Each flank has a white patch at the front, above the beak, eye and flipper, and a second patch at the rear. These two patches are connected by a thin white strip, creating, loosely speaking, an hourglass shape; hence the common name of the dolphin. The markings can vary between individuals. The scientific name &quot;cruciger&quot; means &quot;cross-carrier&quot; and refers to the area of black coloration, which, viewed from above, vaguely resembles a Maltese cross or cross pattée. 

In its usual range the dolphin is easily identifiable. The southern right whale dolphin is the only cetacean of comparable size and comparable coloration with overlapping distributions that lives as far south. The absence of a dorsal fin in right whale dolphins, in contrast to the generally tall and curved dorsal fin of hourglass dolphins makes confusion of the two species very unlikely. The dorsal fin in hourglass dolphins is variable and the curvature may be particularly pronounced in older animals. The hourglass dolphin has disk-shaped vertebrae and other inclined processes which gives them higher stability.

An adult male is about in length and weighs over 90 kilograms (about 200 lbs). Juvenile females range from in length and weigh from . Although this species is small, they are extremely fast and agile. Males are thought to be slightly smaller and lighter than females, although the small number of specimens does not permit a firm conclusion.

Female gestation periods are estimated to be 12.9 months and they tend to give birth between mid to late July through October.

An hourglass dolphin has 26 to 34 teeth in their upper jaw and 27 to 35 teeth in their lower jaw. Like all species of dolphins, they use echolocation to find food. There have been no verified sightings of calves and their coloration, size, and diet remains unknown. Like all species of dolphins, they use echolocation to find food.

==Geographic range and distribution==
The range is circumpolar from close to the Antarctic pack ice to about 45°S. The northernmost confirmed sightings are 36°S in the South Atlantic Ocean and 33°S near Valparaíso, Chile, in the Pacific. The overall circumpolar distribution is about 45°S to 67°S, with few sightings made near islands and the majority in the Southern ocean. Sightings have been made most commonly from the south of New Zealand, around the South Shetland Islands and off Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.

== Habitat ==
The hourglass dolphins is a completely Antarctic species. This species prefers colder water so they spend most time closer to the surface where the temperature is around -0.3°C to 7°C. The warmest waters hourglass dolphins have reportedly found in was 14°C.

Hourglass dolphins migrate, moving farther south in the austral summer and moving further north during the austral winter. 

==Behavior==
Hourglass dolphins are often seen in smaller groups up to 10–15 individuals, though groups of up to 100 have been observed.

They share feeding grounds with other cetaceans such as pilot whales, minke whales and southern right whale dolphins and are regularly seen with fin whales. Hourglass dolphins frequently bow-ride waves from ships and baleen whales. There has been observations of hourglass dolphins with southern bottlenose whales, orcas, and Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales.

Examinations of the stomach contents of the few specimens indicate they eat mantis shrimp, polychaete worms, and various (unrecorded) species of squid and small fish. 

The hourglass dolphin life-span is estimated to be similar to that of Atlantic white-sided dolphin and Pacific white-sided dolphin, around 27-46 years.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first named &quot;Delphinus cruciger&quot; by Quoy and Gaimard (1824) after their sighting in January 1820. Lesson and Garnot (1827) named another dolphin with two white patches on the sides &quot;Delphinus bivittatus&quot;. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, scientists have given the hourglass dolphin various synonyms, including &quot;Phocoena crucigera&quot; (Philippi, 1893), &quot;Electra crucigera&quot; (Gray, 1871), and &quot;Lagenorhynchus clanculus&quot; (Gray, 1846; 1849; 1850; 1866). 
Though it is traditionally placed in the genus &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot;, molecular analyses suggest the species is more closely related to the right whale dolphins and dolphins of the genus &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; and it has been suggested that it should be moved to a new genus &quot;Sagmatias&quot;. The taxonomic relationship with the genus &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; (which includes, among others, Hector&#x27;s dolphin) is further supported by the similarity of the echolocation signals to the signals used by &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot;-species.

==Population status==
Sighting surveys were conducted in 1976–77 and 1987–88. Abundance was estimated to be 144,300 individuals, based on line transect sightings in January 1977 and January 1988 in northern Antarctic waters. While the population of the hourglass dolphins has slightly declined since 1988, they are not considered endangered.

==Conservation status==
The hourglass dolphin is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU). They are also listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Although they have not been studied extensively, there are no known major threats to hourglass dolphins, and the species is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

<text>Ardglass () is a coastal fishing village, townland (of 321 acres) and civil parish in County Down, Northern Ireland, in the historic barony of Lecale Lower. It is still a relatively important fishing harbour. It is situated on the B1 Ardglass to Downpatrick road, about to the south east of Downpatrick, in the Lecale peninsula on the Irish Sea. It had a population of 1,668 in the 2001 census, and is located within the Newry, Mourne and Down area.

The village is a commuter centre for workers in Downpatrick and Belfast, a seaside resort and a local service centre providing housing and a variety of shops and services largely concentrated in Castle Place, Quay Street, Kildare Street and Bath Street. A Conservation area was designated in Ardglass in 1996, focused on its early 19th century street pattern. The village has eight archaeological sites within the area and another two nearby. There are a number of listed properties located on Castle Place, Kildare Street and The Crescent. St Nicholas&#x27;s Church, King&#x27;s Castle, Ardglass Castle, Isabella Tower, the disused railway station, the North Pier and the inner Dock are also listed.

==History==
Ardglass grew from a place of little note in the 13th century to a modestly prosperous port in the 15th century. It was an important town and port in the Middle Ages, but no harbour works seem to have been constructed until after 1812. Then William Ogilvie, who had acquired the Ardglass estate, had a harbour built. Further extensions to the pier and a lighthouse were made, but on 27 November 1838 a great storm undermined the lighthouse which fell into the sea along with the end of the pier. The harbour master between 1845 and 1858 was Captain Bernard Hughes (1790–1866), M.N., who was also private secretary to the local squireen, Aubrey de Vere Beauclerk, (a grandson of William Ogilvie), and master of the Erasmus Smith school in Ardglass. When the S.S. Great Britain was run aground in Dundrum Bay in 1846 due to a navigational error, Hughes was involved in her salvage. This led him to champion Ardglass as a &quot;Harbour of Refuge&quot; for vessels off the northeast coast of Ireland in times of distress. He carried on a tireless campaign in the local press and with the Admiralty to achieve his goal, but was ultimately unsuccessful. He invented and patented the keystone method of constructing sea walls in 1849-51 which involved stones being set together without the use of mortar to allow them to expand when being pounded by wave action. Captain Bernard Hughes&#x27;s sons included John Waring Maxwell Hughes (1816–1906), for whom see passim, and his grandsons; Commander William Thomas Hughes (1880–1978), staff captain of the RMS Mauretania, and Vice-Commodore Johnstone Hughes (1866–1931) of Messrs Elder Dempster, who was born in Ardglass. His great-grandsons included, Major General William Dillon Hughes, (1900–1998), head of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who was born in Ardglass, and Air Marshal Sir Andrew Mc Kee (1903–1985), former head of Transport Command.
Work on the pier was completed by 1885 and it remains in use to this day.

Ardglass contains more medieval tower houses than any other town in Ireland, a total of four, reflecting its importance as Ulster&#x27;s busiest port in the 15th century. It also has probably the most extensive network of warehouses from the period surviving in Ireland. These were important in the substantial grain export trade of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Fortifications survive in the town from the fifteenth century, including Jordan&#x27;s Castle, the most imposing of a ring of towers built around the harbour to secure the then important Anglo-Norman trading port, King&#x27;s Castle and Cowd Castle. A map of 1634 shows three buildings: &quot;Greate ward&quot;, &quot;Little ward&quot; and &quot;Ardglas,&quot; the latter referring to the &#x27;green height&#x27; known as The Ward.

Nearby are the ruins of the 15th-century Ardtole Church. Francis Joseph Bigger, the Irish nationalist, and sometime Belfast solicitor, purchased Jordan&#x27;s Castle at Ardglass in the 1890s. He restored the castle, naming it Castle Sean, a model of the Celtic Revival and made it a meeting place for its more prominent people, such as Alice Stopford Green, finally bequeathing it to the state.

===Account of Ardglass in 1833===
The &quot;Dublin Penny Journal&quot; of 30 March 1833 describes Ardglass as follows:
== Economy ==
Ardglass has been a fishing port for more than two thousand years and developed as such due to its location on the east coast of Lecale and its sitting by a natural inlet. It has one of the few harbours which is accessible at all states of the tide and today has two fishing piers, the North Pier and South Pier, a number of fish processing factories and a marina. While the port is not as busy now as in its heyday, 150 years ago, up to £5 million passes through the fish trade here every year. The port specialises in herrings, prawns, and whitefish.

<text>Donaghadee ( , ) is a small town in County Down, Northern Ireland. It lies on the northeast coast of the Ards Peninsula, about east of Belfast and about six miles (10 km) south east of Bangor. It is in the civil parish of Donaghadee and the historic barony of Ards Lower. It had a population of 6,869 people in the 2011 Census.

== History ==
The name &#x27;Donaghadee&#x27; comes from Irish &quot;Domhnach Daoi&quot;, which has two possible meanings: &quot;church of Daoi&quot;, after an unattested saint, or &quot;church of the motte&quot;. Originally the site of a Gaelic ringfort, the Anglo-Normans built a motte-and-bailey castle on the site after they conquered the area in the late 12th century.

In the early 17th century, Hugh Montgomery settled Scottish Protestants there as part of the Plantation of Ulster, and it began to grow into a small town. The former Donaghadee Town Hall is a converted merchant&#x27;s house which was completed in around 1770.

The town featured in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. On the morning of Pike Sunday, 10 June 1798 a force of United Irishmen, mainly from Bangor, Donaghadee, Greyabbey and Ballywalter attempted to occupy the town of Newtownards. They met with musket fire from the market house and were defeated.

Donaghadee was used in the 1759–1826 period by couples going to Portpatrick in Scotland to marry, as there was a daily packet boat. During this period, Portpatrick was known as the &quot;Gretna Green for Ireland&quot;.

The lifeboat station at Donaghadee harbour, founded in 1910, is one of the most important on the Irish coast. The &quot;Sir Samuel Kelly&quot; is a noted lifeboat once based in Donaghadee and now on show and preserved at the harbour for her efforts over 50 years ago. On 31 January 1953, the lifeboat rescued many survivors in the Irish Sea from the stricken Larne–Stranraer car ferry, MV &quot;Princess Victoria&quot;.

Donaghadee railway station, which was open for passenger traffic from 1861 to 1950, was on the Belfast and County Down Railway.

== Demography ==
On Census day (27 March 2011) there were 6,869 people living in Donaghadee (2,997 households), accounting for 0.38% of the NI total. The Census 2011 population represented an increase of 6.1% on the Census 2001 figure of 6,470. Of these:

* 18.43% were aged under 16 years and 22.03% were aged 65 and over;
* 51.89% of the usually resident population were female and 48.11% were male;
* 82.84% belong to or were brought up in a &#x27;Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)&#x27; religion and 6.39% belong to or were brought up in the Catholic faith;
* 76.58% indicated that they had a British national identity, 31.26% had a Northern Irish national identity and 5.71% had an Irish national identity (respondents could indicate more than one national identity);
* 44 years was the average (median) age of the population;
* 11.98% had some knowledge of Ulster-Scots and 2.48% had some knowledge of Irish (Gaelic).

== Lifeboat stations ==
Donaghadee is one of Northern Ireland&#x27;s lifeboat stations.

== Places of interest ==
=== Harbour and lighthouse ===

Donaghadee is known for its harbour and lighthouse. The initial plans and surveys for the harbour were made by John Rennie Senior. He died within two months of work beginning, and was succeeded by his son, John, later Sir John Rennie: the work was completed in 1825. The lighthouse, which was built in limestone was completed in the late 1830s. During the COVID-19 Quarantine, people, usually younger people would place painted stones which would show support to the National Health Service (NHS), major parts of Donaghadee, milestones or just fun drawings. They were removed in late-2020 but in mid-2022 a small bench in the motte was painted with smaller designs of the stones.

=== The Motte ===

The Motte or Moat in Donaghadee was originally a motte-and-bailey castle built by the Anglo-Normans in the late 12th century. The folly or castle on top of the motte was built by Daniel Delacherois in the early 19th century. It was used for storing the gunpowder, used for blasting, when the new harbour was being built between 1821 and 1834. Today it is part of a park, giving views across the town and seawards towards the Copeland Islands.

=== Other activities ===
Scenic walks include the marine walk at The Commons, which comprises a semi-cultivated open space with bowls, tennis, several exercise equipment, putting and an adventure playground.
There are several restaurants and pubs in the town, including Grace Neill&#x27;s, opened in 1611 as the &quot;King&#x27;s Arms&quot;, and which claims to be the oldest bar in Ireland (a claim also made by other pubs, including by Sean&#x27;s Bar in Athlone).

== Wildlife ==
=== Birds ===
The Copeland Bird Observatory is situated on Lighthouse Island, one of the three islands not far, and to be seen, from Donaghadee. It collects data on the migrating birds and by ringing them records the movements of the migratory species. The islands are an internationally important site for breeding Manx Shearwater and Arctic Tern.

=== Flora ===
Among the algae recorded from Donaghadee are &quot;Gastroclonium ovatum&quot;, &quot;Callophyllis laciniata&quot;, &quot;Fucus ceranoides&quot;, &quot;Desmarestia ligulata&quot;, &quot;Hordaria flagelliformis&quot;, &quot;Codium fragile&quot; ssp. &quot;atlanticum&quot; and &quot;Cladophora pygmaea&quot;.
Flowering plants have been recorded from Donaghadee and are listed with details by Hackney (1992).

== Choir ==
Donaghadee Male Choir was founded in 1932. It began as a small local chorus performing in churches and other local functions. The choir has performed internationally and has a membership of over 70 people.

== In the media ==
Donaghadee was the basis for the fictional town of Donaghadoo in the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Lifeboat Luke&quot;, which was animated by the Donaghadee animation studio Straandlooper. The town was also used as a set for some of the film &quot;Mickybo and Me&quot;.

Donaghadee is seen in the films &quot;Robot Overlords&quot; starring Gillian Anderson, &quot;Divorcing Jack&quot;, &quot;Killing Bono&quot; and &quot;Mo&quot; the Mo Mowlam story, starring Julie Walters.

Donaghadee features as the fictional town of Port Devine in the BBC drama &quot;Hope Street&quot; which first aired in 2021.

Donaghadee is mentioned several times in the song Forty Shades of Green, written by Johnny Cash in 1959.

== Sports ==
Donaghadee Rugby Football Club, which was formed by the Rev. Coote, played its first match against Bangor on 7 November 1885.

Donaghadee Football Club are junior football who play their home matches at Crommelin Park in the town. For the 2014–15 season they were members of Division 2C of the Northern Amateur Football League. An earlier club of the same name held membership of the same league from 1948 to 1953. Donaghadee FC and Donaghadee 11s were both promoted from their respective leagues in 2016/17.

Donaghadee Ladies&#x27; Hockey Club have two teams which play in Ulster Hockey leagues: The 1XI play in Senior League 3, while the 2XI are in Junior 8.

Donaghadee Sailing Club (which underwent redevelopment and in May 2009 with a new clubhouse opened).

<doc id="440100" wikidata="Q6417168" url="?curid=440100" title="Kissel Motor Car Company">
<text>The Kissel Motor Car Company was an American automobile and truck manufacturer founded by Louis Kissel and his sons, in Hartford, Wisconsin. The company custom built high-quality automobiles, hearses, fire trucks, taxicabs, and trucks from their plant at 123 Kissel Avenue in Hartford. 

==History==


Conrad Kissel (b.1812, d. 1872) emigrated from Prussia to Addison in Washington County, Wisconsin in 1857. His son, Louis C. Kissel, moved to Hartford, Wisconsin, in 1883. In 1890, Louis, in a partnership with his four sons Adolph P., Otto P., William L. and George A., opened Kissel Hardware Store, the Hartford Plow Company that manufactured and distributed farm machinery, Kissel Manufacturing Company, and the Hartford Electric Company. Through Kissel Manufacturing Company, they distributed engines for various manufacturers and developed their own gasoline engines including outboard boat motors. The partnership was also involved in home building and sales through, a stone quarry, sand pit, and facilities for milling their own finished lumber. In 1906 Otto formed the First National Bank of Hartford as a principal shareholder and became Vice-President. In 1925 Otto was elected president and held that position until retiring in January 1933.

In 1906 the Kissel Motor Car Company was incorporated by Louis, his four sons, and US District Attorney H. K. Butterfield. The company began production in 1907. Kissel prospered after the war but with stiff competition and the Great Depression, mounting losses, and an attempted hostile take-over by New Era Motors&#x27; president Archie Andrews, forced Kissel to file for receivership protection in November 1930.

=== Kissel Kar, Kissel ===
In 1907 the Kissel Motor Car Company, advertised as &quot;Kissel Kar&quot;. Approximately 200 of the 35,000 automobiles the company produced are known to exist today along with at least one of the Kissel-built FWD Model B trucks. The Wisconsin Automotive Museum of Hartford has several of these remaining cars on display.

The Kissel marque experienced some sporting success, with Harvey Herrick winning the 1910 Los Angeles to Phoenix &quot;Cactus Derby&quot; road race behind the wheel of a &quot;KisselKar.&quot; The most famous Kissel was one the company donated to Hollywood actress Anita King for her transcontinental trip in 1915 that marked the first-ever such trip by a female driving alone. The most popular Kissel model was the 1919 thru 1927 Speedster, nicknamed the &quot;Gold Bug&quot;. The two passenger (sometimes four-passenger) Gold Bug was owned by famous personalities of the time such as actor Fatty Arbuckle and aviator Amelia Earhart. Beginning in 1927, Kissel also produced the sporty White Eagle Speedster.

==== Gold Bug ====

The car Kissel referred to as a &quot;speedster&quot; was widely known as the &quot;Gold Bug&quot;. The car was popular with many other celebrities including Amelia Earhart, Bebe Daniels, Jack Dempsey, Ralph DePalma, Eddie Duchin, Douglas Fairbanks, Greta Garbo, Gladys George, Ruby Keeler, William S. Hart, Al Jolson, Mabel Normand, Mary Pickford, and Rudy Vallee. A 1923 Gold Bug (model 6-45), one of four survivors from that model and year, was owned by Andrew Kissel and William Ruger. The 1927 Kissel Gold Bug Coupe Roadster was used in the movie &quot;The Eddy Duchin Story&quot; in 1956. 

The only remaining 1921 Kissel Gold Bug Speedster won &quot;Best in Class - Vintage Era Sporting&quot; at the 2018 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance and won &quot;Best in Class - American Spirit - 1920 to 1931&quot; at the 2019 Elegance at Hershey. 

Kissel used Mercury as its logo. In the late 1930s, Henry Ford requested use of the logo for a new marque the Ford Motor Company was planning to introduce, and permission was granted.

=== Kissel Trucks ===
Kissel manufactured trucks of 3/4, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 tons, and maintained a sales office at 2515 Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois in early 1913. In 1915 the company (542 Kissel Ave.) advertised in the &quot;National Lumberman&quot; the new models that included a 1000 lb. and 6 ton replaced the 5 ton. 

During World War I the company produced trucks for the US military and for the allies prior to the U.S. entry into the war. In June 1915 Kissel shipped 30 ambulances and 50 heavy service trucks to the Kingdom of Serbia. By 1918 Kissel was producing FWD Model B 3 ton &quot;Buddy&quot; trucks (not to be confused with the Standard B &quot;Liberty&quot; 3-ton truck) under license from the Clintonville, Wisconsin based Four Wheel Drive Auto Company for the U.S War Department.

=== West Bend Company ===

In 1935, the Kissels manufactured outboard motors and were major suppliers of Sears, Roebuck. In 1942 the business was sold to the West Bend Aluminum Company.

<text>Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six (often shortened to Rainbow Six or R6) is a tactical shooter video game series by Red Storm Entertainment and Ubisoft, marketed under the &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s&quot; banner of military-themed video games. Based on the novel &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; by American author Tom Clancy, it revolves around a fictional international counterterrorist organization called &quot;Rainbow&quot;. &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; started in 1998 and as of 2024 consists of 13 entries with 6 expansion pack from early installments.

&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; is one of the most popular and most influential tactical shooter series, and early installments in the series helped propel the tactical shooter genre into the mainstream. Since the mid-2010s, a significant esports scene has formed around newer &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; games.

The original game in the series is &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six (1998)&quot;.

== Setting ==
&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; follows a secret international counterterrorist organization called &quot;Rainbow&quot; (or &quot;Team Rainbow&quot;; capitalization varies between &quot;Rainbow&quot; and &quot;RAINBOW&quot;). The series is set in the canon &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s&quot; universe, which is mostly shared with &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; and &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot;.

Formed in 1999 by the world&#x27;s military, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies to combat the post-Cold War global rise in terrorism, Rainbow is a rapid reaction force consisting of &quot;operators&quot; from nations and organizations worldwide, ranging from special forces soldiers and police tactical unit members to intelligence officers and field experts, trained and equipped to be the most capable counterterrorist professionals in the world, able to handle any terrorist attack, hostage rescue, or takedown that local authorities cannot conduct in an effective, reliable, or timely manner. Rainbow is headquartered in Hereford, England, but has global jurisdiction and can base themselves at any intelligence agency&#x27;s headquarters (such as Langley, Virginia) should their continued presence in a region be necessary.

Due to the sensitive nature of their operations, such as being deployed in multinational incidents or against threats possessing weapons of mass destruction, and to simply prevent terrorists from knowing of their existence, Rainbow operates in complete secrecy, with only the most senior government, military, and intelligence officials knowing they even exist. Cover-ups are often conducted after Rainbow&#x27;s deployments to disguise operators as local police or military units, omit details that could alarm the public, or prevent the reporting of certain deployments.

The leader of Rainbow is designated &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; (or just &quot;Six&quot;), a reference to the American rank code for captain (O-6). The first Six was former U.S. Navy SEAL and CIA operations officer John Clark, who led the organization from its founding until his retirement. Since then, numerous individuals have taken the role of Six, the most recent being Harry Pandey.

Though the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; universe is generally grounded in reality and maintains its basic premise, recent installments and plot events partially depart from the series&#x27; established setting or Rainbow&#x27;s traditional policies, with Rainbow hosting a publicly visible tactical competition, recruiting non-government or independent operators such as private military company &quot;Nighthaven&quot;, and being deployed to defeat invading extraterrestrials.

==Video games==
The first game was developed by Red Storm Entertainment, while the novel was being written. Red Storm was acquired in 2000 by Ubisoft, which has continued to manage the series ever since.

<doc id="440109" wikidata="Q4405696" url="?curid=440109" title="HMS Cobra (1899)">
<text>HMS &quot;Cobra&quot; was a turbine-powered destroyer of the Royal Navy. She was built speculatively by Armstrong Whitworth and then offered for sale to the British Admiralty. She was launched on 28 June 1899, and purchased by the Navy on 8 May 1900 for £70,000.

Her short career came to an end when she broke her back and sank near South Dowsing Shoal, off Ingoldmells, on 18 September 1901. The break occurred from her bows, between the two aft boilers. Twelve men — including the chief engineer — were saved; 44 Navy officers and men, as well as 23 staff from the contractors, mostly employees of the turbine manufacturers, Parsons Marine, were drowned.

A court-martial enquiry held in October absolved the surviving officers of all blame, finding that &quot;&quot;Cobra&quot; did not touch the ground or come into any contact with any obstruction, nor was her loss due to any error in navigation, but was due to structural weakness of the ship.&quot; This was contested by the manufacturers and other shipbuilders, with examples of equivalent boats being navigated to Australia or Japan without incident.

The loss of &quot;Cobra&quot; came only six weeks after that of the destroyer , the only other turbine-powered ship in the navy. Both ships had been intended as trial vessels to demonstrate the capabilities of the new technology. Neither loss was caused by problems with the turbines, but the losses were still a setback for the general introduction of turbines into warships. The losses came after the loss of in 1890 and created an aversion in the Royal Navy towards snake names, and these names were not reused.

==History==
&quot;Cobra&quot; was constructed by Armstrong Whitworth and company as a private venture and was one of two which it offered for sale to the British Admiralty on 12 December 1899. Ship number 674 was fitted with Parsons Marine turbines similar to those installed in the destroyer . Such engines were expected to be 60% more powerful than reciprocating engines usually fitted to similar ships at that time. There were four shafts from the engines, each driving three propellers. The overall design was based on that for the destroyers and recently built in the same yard. The Director of Naval Construction, Sir William Henry White inspected the vessel and although considering it to be less strong than would have been the case had it been specified by the navy, could find no particular objections to its hull design. It was considered that the Admiralty should purchase it rather than permit its sale to a foreign navy.

===The shipwreck===
The ship had her first steam trials in June 1900. She was completed including Admiralty alterations and had finished steam trials by September 1901. Lieutenant Bosworth Smith — with a crew of two officers and 48 men — was appointed to collect the ship from Newcastle and take her to Portsmouth where she would be fitted with guns and ammunition. She left Elswick at 11:00 on 17 September, proceeding down the river Tyne, where the crew adjusted the compass, reaching the mouth of the river by only 19:00 and then taking a course S 25° E at about . Wind from the NNW and a rough sea caused the ship to roll heavily, so that there was difficulty feeding coal to the boilers and two had to be extinguished, reducing speed to by around 22:00. Stoker John Collins reported that in the early morning of the 18th, the crew could hardly stand in the stokehold. By dawn on the 18th, it was possible to increase speed to . At 07:00, the &#x27;Outer Dowsing&#x27; lightvessel was seen about away. &quot;Cobra&quot; altered course towards the light to confirm its identity and was seen approaching by crewmembers of the lightvessel. Its crew reported that &quot;Cobra&quot; was seen to be &quot;plunging heavily&quot;, then stopped in a cloud of steam, before breaking in two. The stern section sank, while the bow continued to drift in the wind.

Chief Engineer Percey from &quot;Cobra&quot; stated that around 07:15, he was in the engine room and felt an impact as though the ship had hit something. He went on deck and discovered that the ship was breaking in two, he being on the aft part. An attempt was made to launch the ship&#x27;s whaler, but this capsized from overcrowding as 40-50 men tried to get aboard. There were three collapsible boats, but there was insufficient time to assemble them before the ship sank. A dinghy was successfully launched containing Petty Officer Francis Barns and seven others. Barns threw out everything he could from the dinghy and managed to get onboard four more survivors, including Percey. Three of these had to stay in the water holding the side of the boat for three hours until the sea had calmed enough to get them aboard. It was reported that another sailor, reaching the boat after an exhausting swim, saw that &quot;if he added his weight all would be lost, so he said &quot;It&#x27;s one for many, good-bye all,&quot; and he loosed his grip, sinking to rise no more&quot;. The 12 were picked up by the steamer &quot;Harlington&quot; at about 18:15 and landed at Middlesbrough. Although men in the water had lifebelts, these were not enough to keep them from drowning in the heavy seas. Lieutenant Smith was last seen standing on the bridge as the front part of the ship sank.

John Smith, master of the steam fishing lighter &#x27;15&#x27; left Great Yarmouth harbour at 08:00 and heading towards the South Dowsing light. About 16:30, he picked up two dead men from the sea and seeing the wreck of &quot;Cobra&quot; went towards it. About of the front of the ship was sticking out of the water, bottom uppermost. There was no sign of life around the still visible ship so he went to the lightship for information. He was asked to take news ashore about what had happened, but first returned to &quot;Cobra&quot;″s whaler, which was floating upside down and recovered more bodies from the sea. On 20 September, Commander Storey of the naval vessel &quot;Hearty&quot; attempted to tow the wreck — which was still visible — into shallower water. He managed only to move it . A Swedish diver — Mr. Frank Carlson — made several descents to the wreck, which was lying bottom up with the stem raised off the sea bed.

===Court-martial and committee of enquiry===

A court-martial was held to investigate the sinking under the presidency of Rear-Admiral Pelham Aldrich commencing on 10 October 1901. Armstrong&#x27;s general manager — Mr. Philip Watts — was called to give evidence. He was a trained naval architect and later became Director of Naval Construction at the Admiralty. He testified that the ship was slightly longer than &quot;Swordfish&quot;, thus weaker, but to compensate for this had been increased in depth making it 17% stronger. He did not consider the force of the waves was sufficient to account for the ship breaking up, and anyway the break had not occurred at the point where the hull would be weakest. He conceded that the engines had proved heavier than had been designed for and the ship had been some over her design weight of when she set out. The diver had found a indentation extending along the keel plate starting a foot (30 cm) from the jagged break in the ship, although the paintwork was undamaged. Watts claimed this as evidence that the ship had struck the mast of a wrecked ship. No such wreck could be found, but &quot;Cobra&quot;″s stern section also could not be located. Carpenter&#x27;s Mate E. Privett testified that he had felt two slight shocks while standing on the bridge as though the ship had grounded, and that shortly afterwards the stern had risen 20-30°. Captain Shilling from the steamer &quot;Oakwell&quot; reported hitting floating wood in the nearby area. The court-martial found that the ship had broken up because of structural weaknesses, rather than from striking some object. It also criticised White for having authorised the purchase.

An enquiry was set up in November 1901 under Vice-Admiral Rawson because of ongoing concerns that if &quot;Cobra&quot; had been dangerously weak, other vessels might also be. Committee members included Dr. John Inglis, Professor John Biles, Mr. Archibald Denny and H. E. Deadman. Tests were carried out on the destroyer , which was supported in cradles before surrounding water was drained away, so that the resulting strain on the hull from support at just a few points could be measured. The results confirmed theoretical calculations that the design was sufficiently strong. Sea trials were conducted, where stresses were found to be always lower than those in the dock tests. The final conclusion was that &quot;Cobra&quot; was weaker than most similar vessels, but stronger than some. There was no reason to believe she should have broken up from wave action unless there had been some undetected major failing in the material from which she was made or in its assembly. There was no evidence of such failings during her construction.

The court martial and enquiry reports were classified as secret for 50 years, preventing outside experts examining the detailed evidence. In more recent times an alternative explanation of the sinking to that produced by the court-martial has been proposed. That &quot;Cobra&quot; struck timber floating in the water, first causing the denting to the keel plate, but then striking again further back along the ship at a weaker point in the bottom plating, creating a hole. This is consistent with the two shocks reported by some of the survivors. The hole allowed sufficient water to enter the ship that it reached at least the level of the boilers before she broke up. Stoker Collins reported that it was steam from flooding water having reached one of the boilers which alerted the boiler room crew to a problem, and that they evacuated the room before the ship broke in two. The added weight of this quantity of water would have been enough to break the ship in the heavy sea.

<text>Mark John Douglas Messier (; born January 18, 1961) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. His playing career in the National Hockey League (NHL) lasted 25 seasons (1979–2004) with the Edmonton Oilers, New York Rangers, and Vancouver Canucks. He also played professionally with the World Hockey Association (WHA)&#x27;s Indianapolis Racers and Cincinnati Stingers. He also played a short four-game stint in the original Central Hockey League (CHL) with the Houston Apollos in 1979. He was the last WHA player to be active in professional ice hockey, and the last active player in any of the major North American professional sports leagues to have played in the 1970s. After his playing career, he was special assistant to the president and general manager of the Rangers.

Messier is considered one of the greatest ice hockey players of all time. He is second on the all-time list for playoff points (295) and third for regular-season games played (1756) and regular-season points (1887). He is a six-time Stanley Cup champion—five with the Oilers and one with the Rangers—and is the only player to captain two teams to Stanley Cup championships. His playoff leadership while in New York, which ended a 54-year Stanley Cup drought in 1994, earned him the nickname &quot;The Messiah&quot;, a play on his name. He was also known, throughout his career, as &quot;The Moose&quot; for his aggression and strength. He twice won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player, in 1990 and 1992, and in 1984 won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player during the playoffs. He was selected for the NHL All-Star Game 16 times. In 2007, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, in his first year of eligibility. In 2017, Messier was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

On June 30, 2017, he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada by Governor General David Johnston for &quot;contributions to hockey as an outstanding player and captain, and for his leadership in encouraging children to take up the sport.&quot;

==Early life==
Messier was born in St. Albert, Alberta, the son of Mary-Jean (Dea) and Doug Messier. He was the second son and third child of four; his siblings are Paul, Mary-Kay, and Jennifer. The Messier family moved to Portland, Oregon when Mark was young, where Doug played for the Portland Buckaroos of the minor pro Western Hockey League. The family returned to St. Albert in 1969 after Doug retired from hockey. Messier attended St. Francis Xavier High School in Edmonton as he played junior hockey where Doug was his coach and mentor for his early years.

Messier&#x27;s brother Paul was drafted by the Colorado Rockies 41st overall in the 1978 NHL Amateur Draft, but he only played nine games with the club in 1978–79 before embarking on a long career in the German Eishockey-Bundesliga. Paul helps manage a hotel that Messier owns in Harbour Island, Bahamas. Messier&#x27;s cousins Mitch and Joby also skated for NHL clubs. Joby was briefly Mark&#x27;s teammate on the Rangers.

==Playing career==
===Early years and WHA===
In 1976, Messier tried out for the junior Spruce Grove Mets of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL), where his father, Doug Messier, was coaching. As Messier was only 15 (the age limit was 20), Doug did not expect him to make the team, though he was surprised and was added to the roster. Messier recorded 66 points in 57 games with the Mets in the 1976–77 season. The team, which relocated to St. Albert the following season and was renamed the St. Albert Saints, named Messier captain for 1977–78, and he scored 74 points in 54 games. After the season he joined the Portland Winterhawks of the major junior Western Hockey League (WHL) for the playoffs, appearing in 7 games and scoring 5 points.

Before the start of the 1978–79 season, Messier was looking for alternatives to another season with the Saints, as he felt he was too good for the AJHL. He was not interested in playing in the WHL, so he initially tried out for the Canadian Olympic team, which was preparing for the 1980 Winter Olympics. At the same time, Doug contacted his former junior teammate Pat Stapleton, who was coaching of the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association (WHA), who needed someone to replace another young player they had just traded, Wayne Gretzky. Doug called him and got Messier a contract to play hockey in Indianapolis for $30,000. However Messier only took a 5-game amateur tryout, as it would allow him to return to junior hockey if need be.

Messier played 13 games with the Saints to start the season, then joined the Racers on November 5 for his professional debut against the Winnipeg Jets. He played four games with the Racers, followed by a further two more with the Saints, before his final game with Indianapolis on November 28. Offered a longer contract, Messier held off on signing it, which proved fortuitous as the team folded on December 15; his only cheque from them bounced. Returning to the Saints, Messier played his final two games of junior hockey for them before he was signed by the Cincinnati Stingers, also of the WHA. Messier signed a contract for $35,000 to play the rest of the season with the Stingers. He scored his first professional goal on March 20, 1979, against Pat Riggin of the Birmingham Bulls. Messier played 47 games for the Stingers, tallying one goal and 10 assists.

===Edmonton Oilers (1979–1991)===
The WHA folded after the conclusion of the 1978–79 season, and four of the six remaining teams were admitted into the NHL; both the Stingers and the Bulls were not included in the merger and instead joined the minor Central Hockey League. The players were dispersed to teams that had already owned their NHL rights, or were allowed to enter the 1979 NHL Entry Draft; being under 20 years old Messier was eligible for the draft, and was selected in the third round, 48th overall, by the Edmonton Oilers. He refused the Oilers&#x27; initial contract offers, a four-year two-way contract or one year at $20,000 plus an option for a second year, instead wanting four-years at $50,000 per year, but ultimately signed what the Oilers offered.

During his first year in the NHL, Messier had several discipline issues, and at the end of October, he missed a team flight and was subsequently re-assigned to their CHL affiliate, the Houston Apollos, for four games. On returning to Edmonton, Messier moved back in with his parents, living at their St. Albert home.

Messier was a fierce, tough competitor whose intense leadership in the dressing room was as important as the goals he scored on the ice. He was not initially known as a scorer, but his offensive numbers increased steadily over his first few years with the Oilers. In 1981–82, he registered his only 50-goal season. For most of his tenure with the Oilers, he played on a line with Glenn Anderson.

Initially a left-winger (he was named to the NHL First All-Star Team in 1982–83 on the left wing), Messier switched to centre in the 1984 playoffs, and the results were spectacular. In Game 3 of the 1984 Finals, for example, with his Oilers trailing the four-time defending champion New York Islanders by a goal, it was Messier&#x27;s goal on a brilliant end-to-end rush that sparked a comeback by the Oilers. By the end of the series the Oilers had won their first Stanley Cup and Messier had earned the Conn Smythe Trophy, awarded to the most valuable player of the playoffs.

In 1984, Messier was suspended for ten games for cracking Jamie Macoun&#x27;s cheekbone with a sucker punch from behind during a game against the Calgary Flames on December 26. Messier was retaliating for having been boarded by Macoun earlier in the game, but the NHL ruled that he had instigated the fight.

On September 6, 1985, Messier lost control of his Porsche and totaled it by hitting three parked cars. He was later charged with hit and run and careless driving, for which he paid a fine.

He won four more Cups with the Oilers, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990, for the last of which he captained the Oilers to a five-game victory over the Boston Bruins. Though the Oilers had been a 1980s powerhouse, the 1990 victory, which came two years after Wayne Gretzky was traded away, surprised many. Messier also won the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP that season, edging out the Bruins&#x27; Ray Bourque by just two votes, the narrowest margin in the award&#x27;s history.

Though Messier was actually under contract to the Oilers until 1993, his agent and father Doug Messier unsuccessfully pressed Oilers President and GM Glen Sather for a new deal in the summer of 1990. After the 1990–91 season, Messier was upset that the Oilers were willing to let Adam Graves leave the team. Messier issued a public trade demand during the Canada Cup tournament saying that he wanted out if the Oilers were not willing to do what was necessary to keep important players. On October 4, 1991, in one of many cost-cutting moves by Edmonton management, Messier was traded to the New York Rangers for Louie DeBrusk, Bernie Nicholls, and Steven Rice.

===New York Rangers (1991–1997)===
In his first season with the Rangers, Messier won his second Hart Trophy and guided the Rangers to the best record in the NHL. However, they were ousted in six games in the second round of the playoffs by the eventual champions Pittsburgh Penguins.

In 1992–93, the Rangers missed the playoffs, and was the first time in Messier&#x27;s career that he did not play in the postseason. After the season, Mike Keenan was hired as head coach.

In the 1993–94 NHL season, the Rangers rebounded to once again finish first overall, and this time were expected to win the Cup. After easily ousting the Islanders and Capitals in the first two rounds, the Rangers&#x27; road to the Cup would get a lot harder.

Down 3–2 and 2–0 in game 6 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals against the rival New Jersey Devils, Messier confronted the New York media and publicly guaranteed a Game 6 victory. With fans and players on both sides reading the news headline, it then became a feat comparable to Babe Ruth&#x27;s called shot and Joe Namath&#x27;s Super Bowl III guarantee, and he backed it up by scoring a natural hat trick in the third period on an empty net goal with ESPN play-by-play commentator Gary Thorne boasting, &quot;Do you believe it? Do you believe it? He said we will win game six and he has just picked up the hat trick!&quot; It helped the Rangers erase a 2–0 deficit to win 4–2. The Rangers went on to win the series in a thrilling seventh game double overtime nailbiter.

In the Stanley Cup Finals, Messier scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in Game 7 at Madison Square Garden, giving the Rangers their first Stanley Cup in 54 years. He became the first (and to this date, the only) player to captain two teams to the Stanley Cup, something his former teammate Wayne Gretzky could not do the year before, and provided two of the most memorable images of that Stanley Cup Finals. First, when the buzzer sounded he was jumping up and down with overwhelming emotion as ticker tape fell; fireworks burst and fans and teammates celebrated. The other, which would become an iconic image to the Rangers and their fans, taken by George Kalinsky, photographer at Madison Square Garden, showing incredible emotion as he accepted the Stanley Cup from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. Finally, during the ticker-tape parade celebrating the Rangers&#x27; win, Rudy Giuliani, witnessing his first New York sports team championship victory just five months after becoming mayor, dubbed Messier &quot;Mr. June,&quot; conjuring Reggie Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Mr. October&quot; nickname.

In 1995–96, Messier came as close as he had since 1991–92 to break the 100-point plateau when, at the age of 35, he recorded a 99-point season. In 1996–97, former Oilers teammate Wayne Gretzky joined the Rangers, while Messier retained the captaincy and had a respectable 84-point regular season. The two led the team to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were eliminated by the Philadelphia Flyers in five games, as the Rangers could not match the size and strength of Eric Lindros and his &quot;Legion of Doom&quot; linemates. Messier left the club after the season (see below), ending the brief reunion of Messier and Gretzky being together again on the same team after just one season. It would also turn out to be both players&#x27; final playoff appearances.

Messier had wanted to finish his career with the Rangers but Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, said the team did not think Messier was worth $20 million USD for the next three years, though Messier maintained that he would have signed a one-year contract extension for under $6 million per season. Although public sentiment sided with Messier, as he led the team to two first-place regular season finishes and the Stanley Cup, General Manager Neil Smith was content having Gretzky and Pat LaFontaine as top centremen, and he came close to landing Joe Sakic from the Colorado Avalanche when he signed him to an offer sheet in the summer of 1997. (The Avalanche matched the offer and Sakic remained in Colorado for the remainder of his career.)

At 36 years old, Messier signed with the Vancouver Canucks to a high-priced free-agent contract. Smith’s decision to keep Gretzky and LaFontaine backfired, as LaFontaine would suffer a career-ending concussion during the 1997-98 season and Gretzky would retire after the following season.

=== Vancouver Canucks (1997–2000) ===
Messier&#x27;s return to Canada after six years with the Rangers was an emotional and high-profile event, but the bliss was brief. Before the season started, captain Trevor Linden relinquished the captaincy to Messier, a move that did not go over well with Canucks supporters. Amidst a turbulent season, in which president and general manager Pat Quinn and head coach Tom Renney were fired, Linden was eventually traded by new coach and acting general manager Mike Keenan to the New York Islanders, where he became their captain, replacing Bryan McCabe, for whom Linden was traded along with Todd Bertuzzi. Messier&#x27;s demand to receive the number No. 11, which he had worn throughout his career with the Oilers and Rangers, but which the Canucks had unofficially retired after Wayne Maki&#x27;s unexpected death in 1974, hurt his image as well. Messier has been said to be &quot;undoubtedly the most hated player in the history of the Canucks&quot;.

In Messier&#x27;s first game back on Broadway, MSG provided a video for him which was displayed on the big screen at the Garden. It was very emotional as some fans as well as Messier himself shed tears. He went on to score a goal in that game against his former team where he received applause after doing so even though he wore a different uniform. One fan displayed a sign that read, &quot;You will always be our captain Mess.&quot;

Sixty points in 1997–98 was his worst mark in a full year since his first NHL season; his next two seasons were shortened by injury and finished with 158 points over three years, considered below expectations compared to other star centremen earning around $6 million US a season, like Steve Yzerman and Joe Sakic. Messier was still expected to be named to the Canadian men&#x27;s hockey team for the 1998 Olympics, in which the NHL allowed its best players to participate for the first time; however, he was surprisingly omitted by General Manager Bobby Clarke.

Keenan was fired from his post as Canucks&#x27; coach midway in the 1998–99 season, as the club missed the playoffs during Messier&#x27;s three years. The team did not attempt to re-sign Messier and he became a free agent after the 1999–2000 season.

===Return to New York (2000–2004)===
Meanwhile, back in New York, the Rangers had fired Neil Smith as general manager following three consecutive non-playoff seasons. His successor was Messier’s former coach in Edmonton, Glen Sather, who began negotiating with the veteran former team captain and Messier agreed to terms to return to Madison Square Garden for the 2000-01 season. To mark Messier’s return to the Rangers, a press conference was called to announce the signing; during the gathering, Messier’s successor as captain, Brian Leetch, ceded his position to his returning teammate and, in a conciliatory gesture, a hatchet was buried in the dirt. Messier also went one step further and guaranteed that the Rangers would return to the playoffs.

Messier&#x27;s 67-point season as a 40-year-old in 2000–01 was a mark better than any he established in his Vancouver years, showing that he could still be a valuable presence, but the Rangers missed the playoffs for the fourth year running. After missing half of 2001–02 due to an arm injury, Messier recorded only 23 points and finished up next year with a 40-point season.

On June 30, 2003, Mark Messier&#x27;s rights were traded to the San Jose Sharks for a fourth-round draft pick. This draft pick ended up being used to select Rochester, New York native and future Rangers captain Ryan Callahan. The Sharks held his rights for just a few hours as he would eventually go on to re-sign with the Rangers as a free agent.

On November 4, 2003, against the Dallas Stars, Messier scored a pair of goals to vault past Gordie Howe into second on the all-time point scoring list with 1,851 points, second-most in League history trailing only Wayne Gretzky. Eleven days later, Messier was the only active player to play in the Legends Game at Edmonton&#x27;s Heritage Classic, suiting up with the Oiler alumni. During his last game at Madison Square Garden (a 4-3 loss to the Buffalo Sabres on March 31, 2004), Messier received applause every time he touched the puck and, after the game, received a standing ovation while he skated around the Garden and bowed to every section of the stands. At the age of 43, most media outlets believed Messier had decided to quit. The NHL lockout eliminated the next season. All speculation ended on September 12, 2005, when he announced his retirement on ESPN radio.

Messier retired eleven games behind Howe&#x27;s then-NHL record 1,767 regular-season games played. Messier holds the record for most NHL regular season and playoff season games played at 1,992. Messier is one of a handful of players to have played 25 NHL seasons, doing so over four decades.

===International career===
Messier only played with Canada once outside North America, winning the silver medal at the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships in Sweden. He also won three consecutive Canada Cups and won silver at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, four tournaments which he described as &quot;my real opportunity to play international hockey.&quot;

==Post-playing career==

On January 12, 2006, during a very emotional ceremony that featured most of the 1994 Stanley Cup team and the Stanley Cup itself, the New York Rangers retired his number 11 in a game against the Edmonton Oilers. During the game, the Rangers defeated the Oilers. His is the 4th number retired by the Rangers. His number was retired by the Edmonton Oilers on February 27, 2007, against the Phoenix Coyotes, then coached by former teammate Wayne Gretzky.

In February 2007, Messier publicly expressed interest in returning to the NHL as general manager for the Rangers; however, the then-current GM Glen Sather responded by saying he had no plans of stepping down from his position. With the departure of Assistant GM Don Maloney from the Rangers organization in May 2007, Messier&#x27;s name had been attached to possible replacements; however, in July 2007, Jim Schoenfeld was announced as Maloney&#x27;s replacement. On November 12, 2007, Messier was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the players category.

In late 2010, Messier coached Canada during two European tournaments—the Deutschland Cup and the Spengler Cup.

Messier also awards the NHL&#x27;s Mark Messier Leadership Award, given to a player who exemplified on-ice leadership, and leadership within their communities. 

Messier also remains active in the City of New York, with Messier playing for the New York Rangers at the 2012 NHL Winter Classic Alumni Game in Philadelphia between the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers on December 31, 2011. Messier had 1 assist during the game, which was won 3-1 by Philadelphia. Messier also ran in the New York City Marathon on November 6, 2011, finishing with a time of 4:14:21. Messier, alongside Sarah Hughes, is also involved in the construction of the Kingsbridge National Ice Center, a $250 million USD, 795,000 square foot redevelopment of the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx into a world&#x27;s-largest indoor ice facility, containing nine ice rinks.

After his retirement, Messier appeared in a Versus television special in the United States highlighting his &quot;Mark Messier Leadership Camp,&quot; which allowed New Yorkers to mix seminars in leadership and working with others with hockey games against former Rangers, including a scrimmage at Madison Square Garden. Messier occasionally worked as a studio analyst on &quot;NHL on Versus&quot;, served as an in-game analyst for &quot;The NHL All-Star Game on Versus&quot;, and has been a guest commentator on &quot;NHL on NBC&quot;. In 2014, Messier joined Rogers Communications as a spokesperson and occasional analyst for the company&#x27;s national NHL coverage. He appeared on various &quot;Rogers NHL GameCentre Live&quot; advertisements including the Vancouver Canucks-themed ad which drew backlash towards their fanbase. In 2021, Messier signed a deal with ESPN/ABC to lead their new look studio coverage, as ESPN and ABC will air NHL games for the first time in 17 years.

Messier was featured in a Lay&#x27;s chips campaign that aired in Canada in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The commercials originally featured Messier being challenged to a bet by a local hockey fan, who bets that Messier cannot eat just one potato chip, about the Lay&#x27;s slogan &quot;bet you can&#x27;t eat just one.&quot; Messier loses the bet, and ends up playing in a local &quot;beer league&quot; hockey game (for a team called &quot;The Pylons&quot;), which he easily dominates. Later variations would have Messier himself making the same bet. He was also featured in Lay&#x27;s ads in the U.S. where he asked neighbors to borrow ice, sugar, or a hairdryer (playing on his bald head) to get chips.

==Personal life==

Messier&#x27;s son Lyon was born on August 16, 1987, and is a former defenceman who spent part of two seasons with the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL, and both the Charlotte Checkers and New Mexico Scorpions of the Central Hockey League. Messier and his wife Kim have a second son and a daughter.

Messier owns the Runaway Hill Club on the pink sand beach on Harbour Island in the Bahamas.

Messier is an advocate for preventative healthcare and was a spokesperson for Cold-fX.

<doc id="440114" wikidata="Q272562" url="?curid=440114" title="Mu (mythical lost continent)">
<text>Mu is a lost continent introduced by Augustus Le Plongeon (1825–1908), who identified the &quot;Land of Mu&quot; with Atlantis. The name was subsequently identified with the hypothetical land of Lemuria by James Churchward (1851–1936), who asserted that it was located in the Pacific Ocean before its destruction. The place of Mu in both pseudoscience and fantasy fiction is discussed in detail in &quot;Lost Continents&quot; (1954, 1970) by L. Sprague de Camp.

Geologists state that the existence of Mu and the lost continent of Atlantis has no factual basis, and is physically impossible, as a continent can neither sink nor be destroyed in the short period of time asserted in the legends, folklore and literature about these places.

==History of the concept==
===Augustus Le Plongeon===
The mythical idea of the &quot;Land of Mu&quot; first appeared in the works of the British-American antiquarian Augustus Le Plongeon (1825–1908), after his investigations of the Maya ruins in Yucatán. He claimed that he had translated the first copies of the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; from the ancient Mayan using Spanish. He claimed the civilization of Yucatán was older than those of Greece and Egypt, and told the story of an even older continent.

Le Plongeon got the name &quot;Mu&quot; from Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, who, in 1864, mistranslated what was then called the Troano Codex (now called &quot;Madrid Codex&quot;) using the de Landa alphabet. Brasseur believed that a word which he read as &quot;Mu&quot; referred to a land that had been submerged by a catastrophe. Le Plongeon identified this lost land with Atlantis and, following Ignatius Donnelly in &quot;Atlantis: The Antediluvian World&quot; (1882), identified it as a continent that had once existed in the Atlantic Ocean:

Le Plongeon claimed that the civilization of ancient Egypt, which is found in Alkebulan/Africa, was founded by Queen Moo, a refugee from the land&#x27;s demise. Other refugees supposedly fled to North America, Central America, and South America and became the Maya.

=== James Churchward ===


Mu, as an alternative name for a lost Pacific Ocean continent previously identified as the hypothetical Lemuria (the supposed place of origin for lemurs), was later popularised by James Churchward (1851–1936) in a series of books, beginning with &quot;Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Man&quot; (1926), re-edited later as &quot;The Lost Continent Mu&quot; (1931). Other popular books in the series are &quot;The Children of Mu&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Sacred Symbols of Mu&quot; (1933).

Churchward claimed that &quot;more than fifty years ago&quot;, while he was a soldier in India, he befriended a high-ranking temple priest who showed him a set of ancient &quot;sunburnt&quot; clay tablets, supposedly in a long-lost &quot;Naga-Maya language&quot; which only two other people in India could read. Churchward convinced the priest to teach him the dead language and decipher the tablets by promising to restore and store the tablets, for Churchward was an expert in preserving ancient artifacts. The tablets were written in either Burma or in the lost continent of Mu itself, according to the high priest. Having mastered the language himself, Churchward found out that they originated from &quot;the place where [man] first appeared—Mu&quot;. The 1931 edition states that &quot;all matter of science in this work are based on translations of two sets of ancient tablets&quot;: the clay tablets he read in India, and a collection of 2,500 stone tablets that had been uncovered by William Niven in Mexico.

The tablets begin with the creation of Earth, Mu, and the superior human civilization Naacal by the seven commands of the seven superlative intellects of the seven-headed serpent Narayana. This creation story dismisses the theory of evolution. Churchward gave a vivid description of Mu as the home of an advanced civilization, the Naacal, which flourished between 50,000 and 12,000 years ago, was dominated by a “Melanated/Black race&quot;, and was &quot;superior in many respects to our own&quot;. At the time of its demise, about 12,000 years ago, Mu had 64 million inhabitants and seven major cities, and colonies on the other continents. The 64 million inhabitants were separated as ten tribes that followed one government and one religion.

Churchward claimed that the landmass of Mu was located in the Pacific Ocean, and stretched east–west from the Marianas to Easter Island, and north–south from Hawaii to Mangaia. According to Churchward the continent was supposedly 5,000 miles from east to west and over 3,000 miles from north to south, which is larger than South America. The continent was believed to be flat with massive plains, vast rivers, rolling hills, large bays, and estuaries. He claimed that according to the creation myth he read in the Indian tablets, Mu had been lifted above sea level by the expansion of underground volcanic gases. Eventually Mu &quot;was completely obliterated in almost a single night&quot;: after a series of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, &quot;the broken land fell into that great abyss of fire&quot; and was covered by &quot;fifty millions of square miles of water.&quot; Churchward claimed the reasoning for the continent&#x27;s destruction in one night was because the main mineral on the island was granite and was honeycombed to create huge shallow chambers and cavities filled with highly explosive gases. Once the chambers were empty after the explosion, they collapsed on themselves, causing the island to crumble and sink.

Churchward claimed that Mu was the common origin of the great civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Central America, India, Burma and others, including Easter Island, and was in particular the source of ancient megalithic architecture. As evidence for his claims, he pointed to symbols from throughout the world, in which he saw common themes of birds, the relation of the Earth and the sky, and especially the Sun. Churchward claimed that the king of Mu was named Ra and he related this to the Egyptian god of the sun, Ra, and the Rapa Nui word for Sun, &quot;ra’a&quot;. He claimed to have found symbols of the Sun in &quot;Egypt, Babylonia, Peru and all ancient lands and countries – it was a universal symbol.&quot;

As additional evidence for his claims, Churchward looked to the Holy Bible and found through his own translations that Moses was trained by the Naacal brotherhood in Egypt. Assyria mistranslated when writing and misplaced the Garden of Eden, which according to Churchward would have been located in the Pacific Ocean.
Churchward makes references to the Ramayana epic, a religious text of Hindu attributed to sage and historian Valmiki. Valmiki mentions the Naacals as “coming to Burma from the land of their birth in the East,” that is, in the direction of the Pacific Ocean.

Churchward attributed all megalithic art in Polynesia to the people of Mu. He claimed that symbols of the sun are found &quot;depicted on stones of Polynesian ruins&quot;, such as the stone hats (&quot;pukao&quot;) on top of the giant &quot;moai&quot; statues of Easter Island. Citing W. J. Johnson, Churchward describes the cylindrical hats as &quot;spheres&quot; that &quot;seem to show red in the distance&quot;, and asserts that they “represent the Sun as Ra.” He also incorrectly claimed that some of them are made of &quot;red sandstone&quot;, which does not exist on the island. The platforms on which the statues rest (&quot;ahu&quot;) are described by Churchward as being &quot;platform-like accumulations of cut and dressed stone&quot;, which were supposedly left in their current positions &quot;awaiting shipment to some other part of the continent for the building of temples and palaces&quot;. He also cites the pillars &quot;erected by the Māori of New Zealand&quot; as an example of this lost civilization&#x27;s handiwork. In Churchward&#x27;s view, the present-day Polynesians are not descendants of the dominant members of the lost civilization of Mu, responsible for these great works, but are instead descendants of survivors of the cataclysm that adopted &quot;the first cannibalism and savagery&quot; in the world.

===John Newbrough===
In the 1882 book &quot;Oahspe: A New Bible&quot;, John Newbrough included a map of the Earth in antediluvian times (i.e. prior to the great flood of biblical record) where an unknown continent is located in the Northern Pacific. Newbrough called this continent Pan. People often link both Pan and Mu as the same mythological continent since both are claimed to be located in the Pacific. Newbrough continues to claim that the unknown continent disappeared 24,000 years ago, but will soon rise from the Pacific and will be inhabited by the Kosmon race.

===Louis Jacolliot===
Louis Jacolliot was a French attorney, judge, and occultist who specialized in the translation of Sanskrit. He wrote about the land of the Rutas, a lost land that ancient sources claimed was in the Indian Ocean but which he placed in the Pacific Ocean and associated with Atlantis stories in &quot;Histoire des Vierges. Les Peuples et les continents disparus&quot; (1874). He amplified upon this in &quot;Occult Science in India&quot; (1875, English translation 1884). He has been identified as a contributor to Rosicrucianism.
===Modern claims===
James Bramwell and William Scott-Elliot claimed that the cataclysmic events on Mu began 800 thousand years ago and went on until the last catastrophe, which occurred in precisely 9564 BC.

In the 1930s, Atatürk, founder of the Turkish Republic, was interested in Churchward&#x27;s work and considered Mu as a possible location of the original homeland of the Turks. On the other hand, according to some views, Atatürk&#x27;s interest in the continent of Mu did not go beyond examining the claims. Despite Tahsin Mayatepek&#x27;s proposals, he did not see the need to establish a Department of Mu Language at Ankara University&#x27;s School of Language and History – Geography. The relationship between Atatürk and the continent of Mu has been exaggerated to attract interest in the books written about the continent of Mu.

Masaaki Kimura has suggested that certain underwater features located off the coast of Yonaguni Island, Japan (popularly known as the Yonaguni Monument), are ruins of Mu.

==Criticism==

===Geological arguments===
Modern geological knowledge rules out &quot;lost continents&quot; of any significant size. According to the theory of plate tectonics, which has been extensively confirmed since the 1970s, the Earth&#x27;s crust consists of lighter &quot;sial&quot; rocks (continental crust rich in aluminium silicates) that float on heavier &quot;sima&quot; rocks (oceanic crust richer in magnesium silicates). The sial is generally absent in the ocean floor where the crust is a few kilometers thick, while the continents are huge solid blocks tens of kilometers thick. Since continents float on the sima much like icebergs float on water, a continent cannot simply &quot;sink&quot; under the ocean.

It is true that continental drift and seafloor spreading can change the shape and position of continents and occasionally break a continent into two or more pieces (as happened to Pangaea). However, these are very slow processes that occur in geological time scales (hundreds of millions of years). Over the scale of history (tens of thousands of years), the sima under the continental crust can be considered solid, and the continents are basically anchored on it. It is almost certain that the continents and ocean floors have retained their present position and shape for the whole span of human existence.

There is also no conceivable event that could have &quot;destroyed&quot; a continent, since its huge mass of sial rocks would have to end up somewhere—and there is no trace of it at the bottom of the oceans. The Pacific Ocean islands are not part of a submerged landmass but rather the tips of isolated volcanoes.

This is the case, in particular, of Easter Island, which is a recent volcanic peak surrounded by deep ocean ( deep at 30 km off the island). After visiting the island in the 1930s, Alfred Métraux observed that the &quot;moai&quot; platforms are concentrated along the current coast of the island, which implies that the island&#x27;s shape has changed little since they were built. Moreover, the &quot;Triumphal Road&quot; that Pierre Loti had reported ran from the island to the submerged lands below, is actually a natural lava flow. Furthermore, while Churchward was correct in his claim that the island has no sandstone or sedimentary rocks, the point is irrelevant because the &quot;pukao&quot; are all made of native volcanic scoria.

===Archaeological evidence===

Easter Island was first settled around 300 CE and the &quot;pukao&quot; on the &quot;moai&quot; are regarded as having ceremonial or traditional headdresses.

==In popular culture==
===Literature/print===
*H. P. Lovecraft (1890–1937) featured the lost continent in his revision of Hazel Heald&#x27;s short story &quot;Out of the Aeons&quot; (1935). Mu appears in numerous Cthulhu mythos stories, including many written by Lin Carter in his Xothic legend cycle.
* The 1970 &quot;Mu Revealed&quot; is a humorous spoof by Raymond Buckland purporting to describe the long lost civilization of Muror, located on the legendary lost continent of Mu. The book was written under the pseudonym &quot;Tony Earll&quot;, an anagram of &quot;not really&quot;. The book claimed to present a translation of a diary compiled by a boy called Kland found and translated by an archaeologist named &quot;Reedson Hurdlop&quot;, an anagram of &quot;Rudolph Rednose&quot;.

<text>Erich Georg Sebastian Anton von Falkenhayn (11 September 1861 – 8 April 1922) was a German general who was the second Chief of the German General Staff of the First World War from September 1914 until 29 August 1916. Falkenhayn replaced General Helmuth von Moltke the Younger after his invasion of France was stopped at the First Battle of the Marne and was in turn removed on 29 August 1916 after the failure of his offensive strategy in the west at the Battle of Verdun, the opening of the Battle of the Somme, the Brusilov Offensive and the Romanian entry into the war. Having planned to win the war before 1917, the German army was reduced to hanging on.

Falkenhayn was given important field commands in Romania and Syria. His reputation as a war leader was attacked in Germany during and after the war, especially by the faction supporting Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg. Falkenhayn held that Germany could not win the war by a decisive battle but would have to reach a compromise peace; his enemies said he lacked the resolve necessary to win a decisive victory. Falkenhayn&#x27;s relations with the Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg were troubled and undercut Falkenhayn&#x27;s plans.

==Early life==
Falkenhayn was born in Burg Belchau, a village near Graudenz, now Białochowo in Poland, to Fedor von Falkenhayn (1814–1896) and Franziska von Falkenhayn, née von Rosenberg (1826–1888). His ancestors could be traced to 1504. His brother Arthur (1857–1929) became tutor of Crown Prince Wilhelm and another brother Eugen (1853–1934) became a Prussian General of Cavalry. His only sister Olga von Falkenhayn was the mother of Field Marshal Fedor von Bock.

==Military career==

Becoming a cadet at the age of 11, Falkenhayn joined the Army in 1880 as Second Lieutenant. He served as an infantry and staff officer. He became First Lieutenant in 1889 and (captain) in 1893, subsequently transferring to the topographical department of the German General Staff. He was seen as a capable, deliberate officer with an open mind. Between 1896 and 1903 Falkenhayn took a leave of absence and served Qing-Dynasty China as a military consultant and helped to establish some Chinese sea ports. In 1889, he returned to German service in the new Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory in China, serving in a &quot;Seebataillon&quot; (Marine Battalion) until March 1899, when he became a Major in the Army. He saw action during the Boxer Rebellion as a general staff officer of Alfred von Waldersee and spent time in Manchuria and Korea.

Service in Asia made Falkenhayn to be a favourite of the Kaiser and he became one of the military instructors of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia. After his service in Asia, the army posted him to Brunswick, Metz and Magdeburg as a battalion commander in the posted area. On 10 April 1906, Falkenhayn became a section chief of the German General Staff. In 1907, Falkenhayn became Chief of Staff of the XVI Corps. In 1908, Falkenhayn was promoted to (colonel). On 27 January 1911, Falkenhayn was appointed as the commander of the 4th Guards Regiment. On 20 February 1913, he became the chief of staff of the IV Corps and on 22 April 1912. Before becoming Prussian Minister of War, he was posted to the General Staff for a year as the Supply department head of the General Staff. Despite being a department head, Falkenhayn did not play a significant role on the General Staff.

=== Prussian Minister of War (1913–1914) ===
On 8 July 1913 Falkenhayn became Prussian Minister of War, succeeding Josias von Heeringen, who was considered to be inactive. During the Zabern Affair, Falkenhayn, as the minister, was part of the conference to end the affair. During the July Crisis, he was at the meeting on 5 July 1914 when Germany announced to Austria-Hungary its support for war. Like most German military leaders, he did not expect a great European war but he soon embraced the idea and joined others in wanting Wilhelm II to declare war. He later noted in his diary, after a discussion with the Kaiser in the Neues Palais in Potsdam, &quot;He makes confused speeches. The only thing that emerges clearly is that he no longer wants war, even if it means letting Austria down. I point out that he no longer has control over the situation&quot;. Falkenhayn wanted early mobilisation since the Kaiser started to secure his palace; when the war began Falkenhayn viewed this with enthusiasm. He assured the Kaiser that the German Army was ready for the conflict. He told the chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg that &quot;Even if we perish over this, it will still have been worth it&quot;.

===Chief of Staff (1914–1916)===
Falkenhayn succeeded Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, who was considered mentally unstable, as Chief of the (the German General Staff) on 14 September 1914. Falkenhayn was 53 years old, making him the youngest man to become chief of staff. Falkenhayn continued in office as minister of war for another five months. Falkenhayn recommended Adolf Wild von Hohenborn as the new war minister; the Kaiser agreed with his recommendation, making Hohenborn the next war minister. Falkenhayn moved OHL to Mézières, to put OHL at the centre of the right wing of the German armies in the west and ordered the southern armies to dig in, part of the beginning of trench warfare. The responsibility of Falkenhayn increased when the Kaiser failed to decide a grand strategy. Falkenhayn did not want diplomatic interference in the course of war. For the first few weeks, lack of success led to widespread criticism. Falkenhayn recognized the pending failure of the Schlieffen-Moltke Plan and attempted to outflank the British and French in the Race to the Sea, a series of meeting engagements in northern France and Belgium, in which each side made reciprocal attempts to turn the other&#x27;s flank, until they reached the North Sea coast and ran out of room for manoeuvre.

In November 1914, Falkenhayn acknowledged that Germany would not be able to gain a decisive victory. He advocated a mild peace with the Russian Empire to Bethmann Hollweg, the better to concentrate against the French and British. Neither Bethmann Hollweg nor the generals on the Eastern Front, such as Paul von Hindenburg, Erich Ludendorff or Max Hoffmann, supported the idea since they believed that negotiation with the Russian Empire was impossible. While Helmuth von Moltke the Younger and Hindenburg were highly critical of Falkenhayn and sought to have him dismissed, the Emperor continued to support him. Falkenhayn did not perceive the need to deploy troops on the Vistula, he favoured sending troops to East Prussia, where the Russians took advantage of the weakening 8th Army. A &quot;Breakthrough Army&quot; () for an offensive down the Somme river valley, consisting of nine new divisions, was formed in the first quarter of 1915 but three divisions were not ready in time. The new army was transferred to the Eastern Front and was re-named the 11th Army. The army had success during the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes but creating more new divisions was difficult because of the shortage of junior officers and equipment.

Falkenhayn found that the (Imperial German Flying Corps, ), needed to be expanded. Falkenhayn noticed that the scepticism of the Ministry of War to airships, made by Ferdinand von Zeppelin, was justified. He tried to use the airships and develop rapidly the air force. Wild von Hohenborn was appointed minister of war and on 20 January 1915, Falkenhayn was promoted to . As the chief of staff, Falkenhayn had many enemies because of his strategic thinking but he had Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, chief of staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army, as his uneasy ally. They differed on war aims; Hötzendorf wanting a war against Russia, Falkenhayn against France. Falkenhayn attempted to keep Italy out of the war but failed. Attacks on the Eastern front to support the Austrians, such as the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive, caused the Russians to evacuate Russian Poland and then to retreat deeper into the Russian interior. On 8 September 1915, Falkenhayn signed a military convention with Conrad von Hötzendorf, which called for an immediate attack on Serbia. In the fall of 1915, Falkenhayn launched an attack against Serbia. Late in the year the favourable situation gave Falkenhayn hope to achieving peace in the east.
Falkenhayn preferred to conduct an offensive strategy on the Western Front, while conducting a limited campaign in the east; he hoped that Russia could be persuaded to accept a separate peace. Hindenburg and Ludendorff opposed this policy and wanted the main offensive effort to be in the east. Falkenhayn tried to weaken the French and British with renewed attacks and unrestricted submarine warfare. According to Admiral Reinhard Scheer, Falkenhayn was an advocate of submarine warfare because countering Britain was an important war aim but this was opposed by Bethmann Hollweg. Falkenhayn conducted a battle of attrition, as claimed in his post-war memoirs, in the Battle of Verdun in early 1916. Falkenhayn argued to the Kaiser that the war would end by causing many casualties to the French Army using methods that limited German losses.

Falkenhayn hoped that the French would fight for Verdun, the gateway to France from the east. Verdun offered the Germans the advantages of their artillery firing from three sides into a large salient in the German lines, excellent German communications and Verdun being bisected by the Meuse, which made it difficult for the French to defend. He ordered the Crown Prince to feint in Verdun and annihilate the French armies, which would try to defend the city by sending more troops. Falkenhayn&#x27;s strategy backfired, the Crown Prince and his chief of staff, Konstantin Schmidt von Knobelsdorf disobeyed the order and tried to seize the city. French artillery on the west back of the Meuse began to inflict many casualties on the 5th Army. Because more than a quarter of a million soldiers during the battle eventually died, Falkenhayn was sometimes called &quot;the Blood-Miller of Verdun&quot;.

Contrary to Falkenhayn&#x27;s expectations, the French were able to limit casualties in the divisions sent to Verdun, General Philippe Pétain kept the divisions in front of Verdun until casualties reached 50 per cent of the infantry, and then relieved them. The procession of divisions back and forth was analogous to the operation of a &quot;noria&quot;, a type of water-wheel that continuously lifts water and empties it into a trough. On 27 August 1916 Falkenhayn received news that the Kingdom of Romania had declared war on Austria-Hungary. After the relative failure at Verdun, coupled with reverses on the Eastern Front (the Brusilov Offensive and the entry of Romania into the war), the beginning of the Anglo-French offensive on the Somme and the intrigues of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, Falkenhayn was replaced as chief of staff by Hindenburg on 29 August 1916.

===Romania (1916–1917)===

Falkenhayn then assumed command of the 9th Army in Transylvania (6 September 1916) and in August launched a joint offensive against Romania with August von Mackensen who attacked from Bulgaria, through the Dobruja. As the commander of the 9th Army, Falkenhayn settled his army in Brașov and deceived the Romanians into believing that there would be no offensives in western Romania. The 9th Army fought the Romanian First Army in Hațeg. After the battle, Falkenhayn joined with Austrian forces to surround the Romanian forces. Falkenhayn delayed the offensive against Romanian forces and as a result came into conflict with Archduke Karl of Austria, who would later become Charles I of Austria. He justified the postponement by pointing to the bad conditions of roads. Even with the conflict with the Austrian Army, in late 1916 and early 1917, Falkenhayn and Mackensen were able to drive the Romanian forces into Russia.

===Palestine (1917–1918)===
Following his success at Brașov, Romania in mid-July 1917, Falkenhayn went to take over the Ottoman Yildirim Army Group ( [Army Group F]), which was being formed in Mesopotamia and at Aleppo. After discussions with the Ottoman general staff, Falkenhayn was made supreme commander of two Ottoman armies in Palestine, with the rank of (field marshal) of the Ottoman Army. In the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, Falkenhayn failed to prevent the conquest of Jerusalem by the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in December 1917 and was replaced by Otto Liman von Sanders.

Falkenhayn is credited with avoiding a battle for the Old City of Jerusalem with its many holy sites, as well as with a crucial role in stopping the forced removal of the Jewish population of Palestine, which Governor Djemal Pasha had planned along the lines of the Armenian genocide. The evacuation of the population of Jerusalem during the harsh winter months had also been planned by Djemal Pasha and was thwarted by German officers including Falkenhayn.

===Belarus (1918–1919)===
In February 1918, Falkenhayn became commander of the 10th Army in Belarus. The unit carried out the occupation tasks in Belarus after Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. As an Army unit commander, he witnessed the end of the war in Belarus. In December 1918 he oversaw the withdrawal of the 10th Army to Germany. The formation disbanded in February 1919 and Falkenhayn retired from the army following the dissolution of his unit.

==Retirement==
In 1919, Falkenhayn retired from the army and withdrew to his estate, where he wrote his autobiography and several books on war and strategy. His war memoirs were translated into English as &quot;The German General staff and Its Critical Decisions, 1914–1916&quot; (1919). With the benefit of hindsight, he remarked that the German declarations of war on Russia and France in 1914 were &quot;justifiable but overly-hasty and unnecessary&quot;. Falkenhayn died in 1922, at Schloss Lindstedt, near Potsdam and was buried in Potsdam.

==Family life==

In 1886, Falkenhayn married Ida Selkmann (1866–1964), with whom he had a son, Fritz Georg Adalbert von Falkenhayn (1890–1973), and a daughter, Erika Karola Olga von Falkenhayn (1904–1974), who married Henning von Tresckow (1901–1944), a general who participated in the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler.

==Assessment==
Falkenhayn in many ways typified the Prussian generals; a militarist in the literal sense, he had undeniable political and military competence and showed contempt for democracy and the representative Reichstag. He addressed the Reichstag in 1914, saying, &quot;Only through the fact that the Prussian army is removed by the constitution from the party struggle and the influence of ambitious party leaders has it become what it is: the secure defence of peace at home and abroad&quot;. Militarily, Falkenhayn had a mixed record. His offensive at Verdun proved a strategic failure. During the campaign against Romania in 1916 Falkenhayn demonstrated considerable skill in command of the 9th Army, driving the Romanians from Transylvania, breaking through the Southern Carpathians and forcing the shattered Romanian forces north-east into Moldavia.

Winston Churchill considered him to be the ablest of the German generals in World War I. Trevor Dupuy also ranked him near the top of the German commanders, just below Hindenburg and Ludendorff. Robert Foley wrote that Germany&#x27;s enemies were far more able to apply a strategy of attrition, because they had greater amounts of manpower, industry and economic control over the world, resorting to many of the methods used by Falkenhayn in Russia in 1915 and France in 1916. As the cost of fighting the war increased, the war aims of the Entente expanded, to include the overthrow of the political elites of the Central Powers and the ability to dictate peace to a comprehensively defeated enemy, which was achieved by a strategy of attrition.

During his term as the Chief of the General Staff, one staff officer wrote that Falkenhayn had lacked decisiveness and foresight in the matters of organization and tactics. All sources portray Falkenhayn as a loyal, honest and punctilious friend and superior. His positive legacy is his conduct during the war in Palestine in 1917. As his biographer Holger Afflerbach wrote, &quot;An inhuman excess against the Jews in Palestine was prevented only by Falkenhayn&#x27;s conduct, which against the background of the German history of the 20th century has a special meaning, and one that distinguishes Falkenhayn&quot;.

<text>In the Sinosphere, the word , realized in Japanese and Korean as and in Standard Chinese as , meaning &#x27;to lack&#x27; or &#x27;without&#x27;, is a key term in the vocabulary of various East Asian philosophical and religious traditions, such as Buddhism and Taoism.

==Etymology==
The Old Chinese * () is cognate with the Proto-Tibeto-Burman *, meaning &#x27;not&#x27;. This reconstructed root is widely represented in Tibeto-Burman languages; for instance, means &#x27;not&#x27; in both Tibetan and Burmese.

==Pronunciations==
The Standard Chinese pronunciation of (; &#x27;not&#x27;, &#x27;nothing&#x27;) historically derives from the Middle Chinese , the Late Han Chinese &quot;muɑ&quot;, and the reconstructed Old Chinese *.

Other varieties of Chinese have differing pronunciations of . Compare Cantonese ; and Southern Min (Quanzhou) and (Zhangzhou).

The common Chinese word () was adopted in the Sino-Japanese, Sino-Korean, and Sino-Vietnamese vocabularies. The Japanese kanji has readings of or , and a (Japanese reading) of . It is a fourth-grade kanji. The Korean is read (in Revised, McCune–Reischauer, and Yale romanization systems). The Vietnamese Hán-Việt pronunciation is or .

==Meanings==
Some English translation equivalents of or are:
*&quot;no&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;nothing&quot;, or &quot;without&quot;
*&quot;nothing&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;nothingness&quot;, &quot;un-&quot;, &quot;is not&quot;, &quot;has not&quot;, &quot;not any&quot;
*# Pure awareness, prior to experience or knowledge. This meaning is used especially by the Chan school of Buddhism. 
*# A negative.
*# Caused to be nonexistent.
*# Impossible; lacking reason or cause.
*# Nonexistence; nonbeing; not having; a lack of, without.
*# The &quot;original nonbeing&quot; from which being is produced in the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;.

In modern Chinese, Japanese and Korean it is commonly used in combination words as a negative prefix to indicate the absence of something (no ..., without ..., un- prefix), e.g., // () for &quot;wireless&quot;. In Classical Chinese, it is an impersonal existential verb meaning &quot;not have&quot;.

The same character is also used in Classical Chinese as a prohibitive particle, though in this case it is more properly written .

==Characters==
In traditional Chinese character classification, the uncommon class of phonetic loan characters involved borrowing the character for one word to write another near-homophone. For instance, the character originally depicted a winnowing basket (), and scribes used it as a graphic loan for (, &quot;his; her; its&quot;), which resulted in a new character () (clarified with the bamboo radical ) to specify the basket.

The character () originally meant &quot;dance&quot; and was later used as a graphic loan for , &quot;not&quot;. The earliest graphs for pictured a person with outstretched arms holding something (possibly sleeves, tassels, ornaments) and represented the word &quot;dance; dancer&quot;. After meaning &quot;dance&quot; was borrowed as a loan for meaning &quot;not; without&quot;, the original meaning was elucidated with the radical , &quot;opposite feet&quot; at the bottom of , &quot;dance&quot;.

==&quot;Mu-kōan&quot;==
&quot;The Gateless Gate&quot;, a 13th-century collection of Zen &quot;kōan&quot;, uses the word &quot;wu&quot; or &quot;mu&quot; in its title (&quot;Wumenguan&quot; or &quot;Mumonkan&quot; 無門關) and first kōan case (&quot;Zhao Zhou&#x27;s Dog&quot; 趙州狗子). Chinese Chan calls the word &quot;mu&quot; 無 &quot;the gate to enlightenment&quot;. The Japanese Rinzai school classifies the Mu Kōan as &quot;hosshin&quot; &quot;resolve to attain enlightenment&quot;, that is, appropriate for beginners seeking &quot;kenshō&quot; &quot;to see the Buddha-nature&quot;&#x27;.

Case 1 of &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot; reads as follows:

The koan originally comes from the &quot;Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu&quot; (), &quot;The Recorded Sayings of Zen Master Zhao Zhou&quot;, koan 132:

The &quot;Book of Serenity&quot; (), also known as the &quot;Book of Equanimity&quot; or more formally the &quot;Hóngzhì Chánshī Guǎnglù&quot; (), has a longer version of this koan, which adds the following to the start of the version given in the &quot;Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu&quot;.

===Origins===
In the original text, the question is used as a conventional beginning to a question-and-answer exchange (mondo). The reference is to the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; which says for example:
Koan 363 in the &quot;Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu&quot; shares the same beginning question.

===Interpretations===
This koan is one of several traditionally used by Rinzai school to initiate students into Zen study, and interpretations of it vary widely. Hakuun Yasutani of the Sanbo Kyodan maintained that
This koan is discussed in Part 1 of Hau Hoo&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of the One Hand: 281 Zen Koans with Answers&quot;. In it, the answer of &quot;negative&quot;, mu, is clarified as although all beings have potential Buddha-nature, beings who do not have the capacity to see it and develop it essentially do not have it. The purpose of this primary koan to a student is to free the mind from analytic thinking and into intuitive knowing. A student who understands the nature of his question would understand the importance of awareness of potential to begin developing it.

====Yoshitaka and Heine====
The Japanese scholar made the following comment on the two versions of the koan:
A similar critique has been given by Steven Heine:
==Non-dualistic meaning==

In Robert M. Pirsig&#x27;s 1974 novel &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, &quot;mu&quot; is translated as &quot;no thing&quot;, saying that it meant &quot;unask the question&quot;. He offered the example of a computer circuit using the binary numeral system, in effect using &quot;mu&quot; to represent high impedance:
The word features prominently with a similar meaning in Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s 1979 book, &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;. It is used fancifully in discussions of symbolic logic, particularly Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, to indicate a question whose &quot;answer&quot; is to either un-ask the question, indicate the question is fundamentally flawed, or reject the premise that a dualistic answer can be given.

&quot;Mu&quot; may be used similarly to &quot;&quot; or &quot;not applicable,&quot; a term often used to indicate that the question cannot be answered because the conditions of the question do not match the reality. An example of this concept could be with the loaded question &quot;Have you stopped beating your wife?&quot;, where &quot;mu&quot; would be considered the only respectable response.

The programming language Raku uses &quot;Mu&quot; for the root of its type hierarchy.

<text>Golden Sun is a role-playing video game developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It was released in August 2001 in Japan, November 2001 in North America and February 2002 in Europe. 

&quot;Golden Sun&quot;″s story follows a band of magic-attuned teenagers called Adepts on a mission to protect the world of Weyard from alchemy, a potentially destructive power that was sealed away long ago. During their quest, the Adepts develop new magic abilities called Psynergy, assist others, and learn more about why alchemy was sealed away. &quot;Golden Sun&quot; is followed by a sequel, &quot;The Lost Age&quot;, which together form a complete story.

&quot;Golden Sun&quot; began as a single planned game for the Nintendo 64, but production shifted to the Game Boy Advance over the course of development. After facing hardware constraints, the developers decided to split the game into two. 

&quot;Golden Sun&quot; was critically and commercially successful, being the top-selling game for four months in Japan and selling more than one million units worldwide. The game was praised as one of the best RPGs on a handheld, rivalling those on full-size game consoles. The game spawned a series that includes three games and appearances in other media.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Golden Sun&quot; is a role-playing video game. The primary game mode is single-player and story-based, in which the player controls a cast of four characters as they embark on a quest, interact with other characters, battle monsters, and acquire new abilities and equipment. &quot;Golden Sun&quot; features an optional battling mode accessible from the menu screen, in which players can enter a team from their saved game files into an arena environment to battle CPU-controlled enemies. There is also a two-person player versus player battle mode, which requires each player to have a copy of the game and a Game Link Cable.

The overworld of &quot;Golden Sun,&quot; which players explore from a top-down perspective&quot;,&quot; contains towns, caves, and dungeons. Environments often contain puzzles, which require the player to perform actions such as creating makeshift bridges by pushing logs into rivers or shifting the track of a mine cart to gain access to new areas. Many puzzles require use of the game&#x27;s magic spells, called &quot;Psynergy&quot;. Psynergy is used in both combat and the environment; for example, the &quot;Whirlwind&quot; spell, which damages enemies in battle, is also used out of battle to remove overgrown foliage blocking the player&#x27;s path. Psynergy comes in four elements: Venus (rocks and plants), Mars (fire and heat), Jupiter (wind and electricity), and Mercury (water and ice). Players can return to previous locations in the game to finish puzzles which they previously could not solve due to lacking a specific Psynergy spell. 
&quot;Golden Sun&quot; contains both random monster encounters, featuring randomly selected enemies, and boss battles that advance the story. During combat, the camera shifts to a pseudo-3D view, spinning and zooming depending on the attacks and items used. In battle, players must defeat enemies while keeping their own party alive through items and Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense. The player receives a &quot;Game Over&quot; if each character&#x27;s hit points are reduced to zero; if this happens, the player loses money and the party is returned to the sanctum in the last visited town. After winning a battle, players receive experience points, coins, and occasionally items.

Players can change their characters&#x27; class and powers using collectable creatures called Djinn. There are 28 Djinn in &quot;Golden Sun&quot;, seven for each of the four elements. They are encountered in the overworld or in dungeons, and either join the player willingly or after being defeated in combat. Assigning Djinn to different characters changes their character class, enabling them to use different psynergy, as well as statistics such as hit points or defense. Djinn can either be &quot;Set&quot; to a player or put on &quot;Standby&quot;. Each Set Djinni has a special ability which can be invoked during combat by the character it is attached to, which includes enhanced elemental attacks, buffing/debuffing spells, healing/restoration spells, and other effects. After being used, the Djinni shifts to &quot;Standby&quot; mode until it is &quot;Set&quot; on the character again. In Standby mode, Djinn do not contribute to character statistics, but can be used for powerful elemental summon spells; after being used for summoning, they return to the Set position after a cooldown period.

==Synopsis==
===Setting and characters===
&quot;Golden Sun&quot; takes place in the fantasy world of &quot;Weyard&quot;—a massive, earth-like environment with several major continents and oceans. Weyard is governed by the mythological concept of the classical elements. Matter consists of any combination of the four base elements: Venus (earth), Mars (fire), Mercury (water), and Jupiter (wind). These elements can be manipulated by the now lost powers of alchemy. Certain people, called Adepts, can use Psynergy (magic) based on the elements.

The player controls four teenaged Adepts in &quot;Golden Sun&quot;: Isaac, his close friend Garet, Ivan, and Mia. A fifth character playable in the game&#x27;s exposition sequence is Jenna, another childhood friend to Isaac. The primary antagonists of the game are Saturos and Menardi, powerful and talented Adepts who seek to restore Alchemy to the world. They are assisted by the powerful and mysterious Alex, who was formerly Mia&#x27;s apprentice; and Jenna&#x27;s older brother, Felix, who is indebted to Saturos for saving his life.

===Plot===
In Weyard&#x27;s ancient past, the power of alchemy enabled the development of great civilizations. However, it also caused worldwide conflict that subsided only after it was sealed away. The keys to unlocking alchemy are four elemental stars hidden within the mountain shrine, Mt. Aleph, which is guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain&#x27;s base. In the game&#x27;s prologue, Saturos and Menardi lead a raiding party into Mt. Aleph to seize the elemental stars for themselves. They accidentally activate protective traps, causing a thunderstorm and rock slide. In the ensuing chaos, Felix, Isaac&#x27;s father, and Jenna&#x27;s parents are presumed dead.

Three years later, Isaac, Garet, and Jenna join their teacher, Kraden, in his research of Mt. Aleph. They are confronted by Saturos and Menardi, now assisted by Alex and a surviving Felix, who coerce Isaac into giving them three of the four stars. After being forced to flee as the volcano erupts, Saturos and Menardi abduct Jenna and Kraden as bargaining chips. Isaac and Garet are saved by the guardian of Mt. Aleph, the Wise One. He instructs the teens to prevent Saturos&#x27; group from casting the stars into their respective elemental lighthouses across Weyard, which will unseal alchemy&#x27;s power.

Isaac and Garet pursue Saturos&#x27; group to the Mercury Lighthouse, meeting Ivan and Mia during their travels. Despite their best efforts, they fail to prevent Saturos from activating Mercury Lighthouse. Saturos&#x27; group leaves for the next Lighthouse with Isaac&#x27;s party in pursuit. In the ensuing chase, Isaac learns that Saturos has taken another Adept hostage: the female Jupiter Adept, Sheba. Saturos and Menardi activate the Venus Lighthouse before Isaac&#x27;s party confronts them. Saturos and Menardi merge to form a massive two-headed dragon in an effort to defeat the party, but they kill them. The remnants of Saturos&#x27;s group continue their quest to light the remaining two lighthouses, with Jenna, Sheba, and Kraden still with them. The game ends as Isaac&#x27;s party boards a ship to sail Weyard&#x27;s open seas and continue their mission.

==Development==
Camelot Software Planning spent between twelve and eighteen months developing &quot;Golden Sun&quot;, considered a long time for a handheld video game; &quot;IGN&quot; described the finished product as a testament to the positive results a long development cycle can bring. Camelot was no stranger to role-playing games, having previously developed &quot;Shining Force&quot; for Sega, and &quot;Mario Golf&quot; and &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; for Nintendo—sports games with role-playing elements.
Camelot originally planned to create a single game instead of a series, and in the early stages of the project created a game design document for &quot;Golden Sun&quot; on the Nintendo 64 console. When it became apparent the Nintendo 64 was being replaced by the GameCube, Camelot shifted their focus to making a game on the handheld Game Boy Advance. Due to the developer&#x27;s ambitions for the scope of the game and the hardware limitations of a single Game Boy Advance cartridge, the single game was expanded to become two. Scenario writer Hiroyuki Takahashi and director Shugo Takahashi had previously designed &quot;Shining Force III&quot;, where the story involved playing through the perspectives of both the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; characters. They incorporated elements of this storytelling methodology into the two-game setup of the &quot;Golden Sun&quot; series, having the player control the protagonists in &quot;Golden Sun&quot; and the antagonists in the followup.

A major goal with &quot;Golden Sun&quot; was to make the game&#x27;s magic usable outside battle for puzzles, and offer players a high level of freedom in how to approach events, rather than a linear story that could only be experienced one way. Camelot&#x27;s President Hiroyuki Takahashi asserted that players would be unable to experience all story paths in a single playthrough, and that this combined with the game&#x27;s multiplayer mode would add to &quot;Golden Sun&quot;″s replay value.

In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Space World Expo in Japan. The game was intended to launch alongside the Game Boy Advance, but slipped to the summer and released in Japan in August 2001. While it was eagerly anticipated in the west, players had to make do with Japanese-language imports until the game was localized and released in North America in November, and Europe in February 2002.

==Reception==
&quot;Golden Sun&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Reviews often noted that the series did not necessarily break new ground, but executed its formula extremely well. Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; said that &quot;Golden Sun&quot; was arguably one of the best 2D-based Japanese RPGs ever. Rick Moulton of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; hailed the game as &quot;the best handheld role-player ever&quot;, while G4 TV&#x27;s Miguel Concepcion and &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Andy McNamara called it the best original RPG on the Game Boy Advance. Reviews often compared it favorably to RPGs for the Super Nintendo (SNES); &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Ronan Jennings wrote that prior to &quot;Golden Sun&quot;, Nintendo treated the Game Boy Advance as &quot;nothing more than a SNES emulator by its makers [...] [&quot;Golden Sun&quot;] not only compared favorably to 16-bit classics of its kind, it even surpassed the majority of them.&quot;
&quot;Golden Sun&quot;″s graphics and audio were praised. Harris called the game the most graphically-impressive on the system, and that the sound surpassed that of the Super Nintendo&#x27;s capabilities. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s review highlighted that the instrumentation often sounded more authentic than synthesized. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Ricardo Torres wrote that the excellent graphics were sometimes let down by the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s poor-quality screen.
Though &quot;Golden Sun&quot;″s story was sometimes considered routine and common among the genre, the game&#x27;s story and characters were generally praised; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s review highlighted that the &quot;by the book&quot; story was elevated by excellent writing and translation. Harris and Moulton felt the chief weakness of the story was that the game&#x27;s pace lagged early on, when it was introducing the large number of characters and featured occasionally &quot;hokey&quot; dialogue.
The fast-paced gameplay and battle system was positively received. While Moulton considered the fights very similar to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, he thought they improved on the formula by being simpler and less annoying. Ricardo Torres, writing for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, considered the only mark against the combat that if an enemy was defeated, player characters would not automatically retarget the remaining foes. The uniqueness of the Djinn was highlighted, as was the ability to use Psynergy outside of combat. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s review noted that the class system worked better in concept than reality, as mixing Djinn assignments often hurt characters more than help.
&quot;Golden Sun&quot; won &quot;Handheld Game of the Year&quot; at the 2002 Golden Joystick Awards. During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Golden Sun&quot; in the &quot;Hand-Held Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Console Role-Playing&quot; categories. It was a nominee in &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Game Boy Advance Game&quot; in 2001 and, among console games, &quot;Best Role-Playing Game&quot; award categories. &quot;Golden Sun&quot; was ranked 94 on &quot;IGN&quot;″s Readers Choice Top 100 games ever. The publication later named the title the 24th-best Game Boy Advance game of all time. It was rated the 31st best game made on a Nintendo system in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;&#x27;s Top 200 Games list. In 2023, Time Extension included the game on their &quot;Best JRPGs of All Time&quot; list.

&quot;Golden Sun&quot; was a commercial success, and sold 740,000 copies in the United States and another 338,000 in Japan. It was followed by &quot;Golden Sun: The Lost Age&quot; in 2002, and &quot;Golden Sun: Dark Dawn&quot; in 2010. &quot;Golden Sun&quot; was re-released for the Virtual Console via the Wii U eShop in April 2014, and was released for the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in January 2024.

<doc id="440121" wikidata="Q209514" url="?curid=440121" title="Second Army (United Kingdom)">
<text>The British Second Army was a field army active during the First and Second World Wars. During the First World War the army was active on the Western Front throughout most of the war and later active in Italy. During the Second World War the army was the main British contribution to the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 and advance across Europe.

==First World War==
The Second Army was part of the British Army formed on 26 December 1914, when the British Expeditionary Force was split in two due to becoming too big to control its subordinate formations. The army controlled both III Corps and IV Corps. Second Army spent most of the war positioned around the Ypres salient, but was redeployed to Italy as part of the Italian Expeditionary Force between November 1917 and March 1918.

In 1919 it was reconstituted as the British Army of the Rhine.

===Commanders===
* 1914–1915 General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien
* 1915–1917 General Sir Herbert Plumer
* 1917–1918 General Sir Henry Rawlinson
* 1918 General Sir Herbert Plumer

==Second World War==

===France, 1944===
The formation was commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey and served under the 21st Army Group. Two of its formations, I Corps (also containing Canadian units) and XXX Corps took part in Operation Neptune, the 6 June D-Day landings that commenced Operation Overlord, with its remaining units coming ashore during the remainder of Overlord&#x27;s Normandy campaign. The third corps to land, VIII Corps, entered the line during late June to add its weight to the assault; in particular for the launching of Operation Epsom. The main British objective during the early stages of the campaign was to capture the French city of Caen, the so-called Battle for Caen. However, due to various factors the city was not captured until mid-July during Operation Atlantic, conducted by Canadian troops under the command of Second Army.

By the end of July, American forces had broken out of Normandy. As they swept east, the German Seventh Army was pinned by the Second Army and trapped in pockets around Falaise. The German formation was subsequently annihilated during the battle of the Falaise pocket. The Second Army then commenced a dash across France in parallel with the Americans on its right, and the Canadians on its left. During the interim, I Corps was transferred from Second Army&#x27;s control, and assigned to the First Canadian Army. Due to the heavy casualties sustained by the army during the Normandy campaign, the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division was disbanded in August 1944 to make up for the infantry deficit.

===Belgium and the Netherlands===
Second Army entered Belgium quickly, and cleared much of the country. Its captures included the capital Brussels and the port city of Antwerp.

Second Army&#x27;s highest profile operation in 1944, apart from Operation Overlord, was providing the main force for Operation Market Garden. During the operation, American (82nd and 101st), British (1st) and Polish (1st Polish Parachute Brigade) airborne troops, outside the control of Second Army, were landed to capture vital bridges over several rivers in the east of the Netherlands, in order to allow Second Army&#x27;s XXX Corps to cross the Rhine and advance into Germany, relieving the parachute troops en route. However, the single road XXX Corps had to traverse caused enormous logistical difficulties and, combined with German counterattacks, the operation failed resulting in the loss of much of the 1st Airborne Division during the Battle of Arnhem.

Second Army spent the rest of 1944 exploiting the salient in the German line that it had created during Operation Market Garden, to advance on the Rhine and Meuse rivers in the Netherlands. The final part of this advance took place in mid-January 1945, with the clearing of the Roermond Triangle (codename Operation Blackcock) by XII and VIII Corps. This enabled the completion of the advance on the River Roer.

During February, 1945, Second Army entered a holding phase. Whilst it pinned down the German forces facing it, the Canadian First Army and US Ninth Army made a pincer movement from north and south (Operations Veritable and Grenade) which pierced the Siegfried Line in that area and cleared the remaining German forces west of the Rhine in conjunction with further American offensives in the south of the Rhineland.

===Germany, 1945===
Second Army crossed the Rhine on 23 March in an attack codenamed Operation Plunder. It then headed across the North German Plain towards Osnabrück, with the First Canadian Army on its left wheeling to clear the north of the Netherlands and the area of Lower Saxony west of Oldenburg. The US Ninth Army on its right turned south-east towards Lippstadt to trap the German Army Group B, under General Walter Model, in an enormous pocket in the Ruhr. With Army Group B trapped, the last major German formation in the west had been neutralized.

Second Army reached the Weser on 4 April, the Elbe on 19 April, the shore of the Baltic Sea at Lübeck on 2 May. On 3 May, Hamburg capitulated. By 7 May the Soviet Army had met up with the British forces. Shortly thereafter, the Second World War in Europe came to an end with the surrender of the government of Karl Dönitz, who had succeeded Adolf Hitler after his suicide.

<doc id="440123" wikidata="Q1382706" url="?curid=440123" title="Keith Primeau">
<text>Keith David Primeau (born November 24, 1971) is a Canadian businessman and ice hockey coach. He is a former professional ice hockey centre who played 15 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Detroit Red Wings, Hartford Whalers, Carolina Hurricanes and Philadelphia Flyers.

He was recently the special assistant to the general manager and director of player development of the Las Vegas Wranglers of the ECHL, now currently an assistant hockey coach at Bishop Eustace Preparatory School, the coach of Revolution in the Revolution Ice gardens, and the owner of a franchise of Bain&#x27;s Deli in Philadelphia. He is the older brother of Wayne Primeau.

==Playing career==
Primeau was drafted third overall in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the Detroit Red Wings after playing two years with the Niagara Falls Thunder of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). He split his first two professional seasons with Detroit and their then-American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Adirondack Red Wings. He set career highs in assists (42), points (73) and plus/minus (+34) in 1993–94. He made his only Stanley Cup Finals appearance while with the Red Wings in 1995, losing in a sweep to the New Jersey Devils. Primeau held out after the club signed Igor Larionov and after playing for Canada in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, Detroit traded him (along with Paul Coffey and a 1997 first-round draft pick, ultimately used to select Nikos Tselios) to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for Brendan Shanahan and Brian Glynn a few days following the start of the 1996–97 season.

Primeau became a leader with his new team when the franchise moved to North Carolina and became the Carolina Hurricanes, being named team captain in 1998–99. However, he missed the majority of the 1999–2000 NHL season after holding out and was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers (along with a 2000 fifth-round draft pick, ultimately used to select Kristofer Ottosson) in exchange for Rod Brind&#x27;Amour, Jean-Marc Pelletier and a 2000 second-round draft pick (Agris Saviels) on January 23, 2000. On May 5, 2000, Primeau scored the game-winning goal in the longest game in modern NHL playoff history (five overtime periods for a total of 152 minutes and one second) against Ron Tugnutt of the Pittsburgh Penguins in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Only two games, in 1933 and 1936, were longer.

In his first full season with the Flyers, Primeau led the team in goals (34) and tied his career-high in points (73). Early in the following season, he was named team captain after defenceman Éric Desjardins resigned from the position. After posting nearly identical seasons statistically in 2001–02 and 2002–03, Primeau was given the task of centering a more defense-oriented line in 2003–04. He did well enough in his new role to earn a surprise selection to the 2004 NHL All-Star Game, the second of his career.

In the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs, Primeau recorded nine goals and seven assists for a total of 16 points; it was the best playoff year of Primeau&#x27;s career and his play carried the team to within a game of the Stanley Cup finals. In Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals, against the Tampa Bay Lightning, Primeau scored the game-tying goal with 1:49 left in regulation. The Flyers won the game, 5–4 in overtime, sending the series back to Tampa for Game 7. The Flyers went on to lose that game by a score of 2–1. Hockey legend Phil Esposito later told Primeau that, &quot;During the &#x27;04 playoffs, when you and the Flyers took the Lightning to seven games, you were the most dominating player I ever saw. More than Orr, Howe, Gretzky, or anyone.&quot;

Nine games into the 2005–06 season, Primeau suffered a concussion which ended his season. As a result of ongoing post-concussion syndrome, he officially announced his retirement on September 14, 2006. On February 12, 2007, the Flyers honoured Primeau before a game against the Detroit Red Wings, the team which originally drafted him. An emotional Primeau thanked the fans for welcoming him back.

Primeau has been a resident of Voorhees Township, New Jersey.

==Personal life==
Primeau, along with his brother, Wayne, and Las Vegas Wranglers general manager Ryan Mougenel, own and operate the Durham Hockey Institute. The three of them are also part-owners of the Whitby Fury, a team in the Ontario Junior Hockey League (OJHL). Keith&#x27;s son Cayden played his college hockey at Northeastern University, before signing his entry-level contract with the Montreal Canadiens after his sophomore season. Cayden was a 7th round draft pick of the Montreal Canadiens in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft and started 5 games for the silver medal winning United States men&#x27;s national junior ice hockey team in the 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

Primeau and his wife Lisa reside in Voorhees, New Jersey with their four children, where they have resided since his January 2000 trade to the Philadelphia Flyers. The family previously resided in Farmington Hills, Michigan earlier in his career.

<doc id="440125" wikidata="Q2106106" url="?curid=440125" title="Post-Fordism">
<text>The concept of Post-Fordism was originally invented by the economist Robin Murray in the British magazine &quot;Marxism Today&quot; in 1988. It referred to the emergence of new production methods defined by flexible production, the individualization of labor relations and fragmentation of markets into distinct segments, after the stagnation and profitability crisis of rigid, bureaucratized Fordist production. The Post-Fordist era is regarded as the successor of the Fordist epoch (the concept of &quot;Fordism&quot;, as a distinct phase in de history of capitalist industrialization, was invented by Antonio Gramsci in 1934 and popularized in France by Michel Aglietta&#x27;s book &quot;Régulation et crises du capitalisme&quot; in 1976). Since the 1980s, the concepts of &quot;Fordism&quot; and &quot;Post-Fordism&quot; were widely adopted by labor economists in Europe and North America. However, the definitions provided for the nature and scope of Post-Fordism vary considerably, and are a matter of debate among scholars.

Fordism was the leading business model for industrial mass production by corporations roughly from the 1910s to the 1960s, adopted during the great expansion of the manufacturing sector in North America, Europe and Japan. Characteristic was a division of work tasks according to the assembly-line model perfected by Henry Ford, and the in-house organization at one large plant location of almost everything required for the enterprise to function (from machinery, manufacture and administration to cleaning, catering and maintenance). Some theorists of post-Fordism argue that the end of the superiority of the US economy is explained by the end of Fordism, across most of the world, and its replacement by more competitive and efficient production models invented mainly in Japan.

Post-Fordist production is a competitive business approach which aims to respond quickly, precisely and effectively to the existence of increased consumer choice as well as to the increased importance of the identity and personal development concerns that individuals have (as employees and as consumers). For this purpose, a great deal of effort goes into collecting consumer data and business data using information technology, to understand what the business trends and changes in consumer demand are. Post-Fordist production networks require much greater flexibility from their workforces, providing more variation in job roles for employees, more individualized labour relations, and more flexible production techniques such as lean manufacturing. 

The Post-Fordist enterprise is usually not one large plant at one location which produces everything almost necessary on-site, but instead a &quot;hub&quot; for a network of smaller specialized organizations at different locations, each of which contributes its own input or service in support of the main output, according to specific contractual agreements. This approach was often found to be more cost-effective, competitive and flexible, in responding/adjusting to changes in business or market requirements; resources are only held, supplied or used where and when they are actually needed. The Post-Fordist organization usually consists of a &quot;group&quot; or &quot;network&quot; of affiliated companies working together to produce products and services. Some of these companies could be owned as subsidiaries by the parent company, but the associated companies could also be independent (outsourced) contractors that supply a variety of clients. This can make it less easy for an outsider to grasp how the whole organization operates, because the total work process is not contained (or visibly present) at just one site, building, factory or office at one place. There are multiple locations within one country, and sometimes across several countries.

== Overview ==
Post-Fordism is characterized by the following attributes:
*Small-batch production
*Economies of scope
*Specialized products and jobs
*New information technologies
*Emphasis on types of consumers in contrast to the previous emphasis on social class
*The rise of the service and the white-collar worker
*The feminisation of the work force

=== Consumption and production ===
Post-Fordist consumption is marked by individualism and consumer choice. Patterns of consumption are oriented toward lifestyle and identity and consumption is a key part of the culture. The consumer has become a &#x27;global dictator&#x27; which determines the organization of production and retailers seek to process consumer data to react to patterns of consumer demand. As such, there is a strong link between post-Fordism and the rise of information technology.

Post-Fordist production prioritizes increased flexibility, in particular lean production and just-in-time production methods. This creates an economic geography of greater interaction between suppliers and manufacturers. For labor markets, this has necessitated a shift from the division of labor to being more adaptable to different roles in production, however, it has also led to more involvement in and knowledge of the labor process and greater autonomy over work. There is an increase in non-standard forms of employment.

== Theoretical approaches ==

According to geographer Ash Amin, post-Fordism is commonly divided into three schools of thought: the regulation school, flexible specialization, and neo-Schumpeterianism.

===Regulation school===
The regulation approach (also called the neo-Marxist or French Regulation School) was designed to address the paradox of how capitalism has both a tendency towards crisis, change and instability as well as an ability to stabilize institutions, rules, and norms. The theory is based on two key concepts. &quot;Regimes of Accumulation&quot; refer to systems of production and consumption, such as Fordism and post-Fordism. &quot;Modes of Regulation&quot; refer to the written and unwritten laws of society which control the Regime of Accumulation and determine its form.

According to regulation theory, every Regime of Accumulation will reach a crisis point at which the Mode of Regulation will no longer support it, and society will be forced to find new rules and norms, forming a new Mode of Regulation. This will begin a new Regime of Accumulation, which will eventually reach a crisis, and so forth. Proponents of Regulation theory include Michel Aglietta, Robert Boyer, Bob Jessop, and Alain Lipietz.

===Flexible specialization===

Proponents of the flexible specialization approach (also known as the neo-Smithian approach) believe that fundamental changes in the international economy, especially in the early 1970s, forced firms to switch from mass production to a new tactic known as flexible specialization.

Instead of producing generic goods, firms now found it more profitable to produce diverse product lines targeted at different groups of consumers, appealing to their sense of taste and fashion. Instead of investing huge amounts of money in the mass production of a single product, firms now needed to build intelligent systems of labor and machines that were flexible and could quickly respond to the whims of the market. The technology associated initially with flexible production was numerically controlled machine tools. The development of the computer was very important to the technology of flexible specialization. Not only could the computer change the characteristics of the goods being produced, but it could also analyze data to order supplies and produce goods in accordance with current demand. These types of technology made adjustments simple and inexpensive, making smaller specialized production runs economically feasible. Flexibility and skill in labor were also important. The workforce was now divided into a skill-flexible core and a time-flexible periphery. Flexibility and variety in the skills and knowledge of the core workers and the machines used for production allowed for the specialized production of goods. Modern just-in-time manufacturing is one example of a flexible approach to production.

Likewise, the production structure began to change on the sector level. Instead of a single firm manning the assembly line from raw materials to finished products, the production process became fragmented as individual firms specialized in their areas of expertise. As evidence for this theory of specialization, proponents claim that Marshallian &quot;industrial districts,&quot; or clusters of integrated firms, have developed in places like Silicon Valley, Jutland, Småland, and several parts of Italy.

===Neo-Schumpeterianism===
The new-Schumpeterian approach to post-Fordism is based upon the theory of Kondratiev waves (also known as long waves). The theory holds that a &quot;techno-economic paradigm&quot; (Perez) characterizes each long wave. Fordism was the techno-economic paradigm of the fourth Kondratiev wave, and post-Fordism is thus the techno-economic paradigm of the fifth, which is dominated by information and communication technology.

Notable Neo-Schumpeterian thinkers comprise Carlota Perez and Christopher Freeman, as well as Michael Storper and Richard Walker.

===Post-Fordist theory in Italy===
In Italy, post-Fordism has been theorised by the long wave of workerism or autonomia. Major thinkers of this tendency include the Swiss-Italian economist Christian Marazzi, Antonio Negri, Paolo Virno, Carlo Vercellone, Maurizio Lazzarato. Marazzi&#x27;s &quot;Capital and Language&quot; takes as its starting point the fact that the extreme volatility of financial markets is generally attributed to the discrepancy between the &quot;real economy&quot; (that of material goods produced and sold) and the more speculative monetary-financial economy. But this distinction has long ceased to apply in the post-Fordist New Economy, in which both spheres are structurally affected by language and communication. In &quot;Capital and Language&quot; Marazzi argues that the changes in financial markets and the transformation of labor into immaterial labor (that is, its reliance on abstract knowledge, general intellect, and social cooperation) are two sides of a new development paradigm: financialization through and thanks to the rise of the new economy.

In terms of the development of the &#x27;technical and political class-composition&#x27;, in the post-Fordist era the crisis explains at the same time &#x27;high points of the capitalist development&#x27; and how new technological tools develop and work altogether (money form, linguistic conventions, capital and language).

==Changes from Fordism to post-Fordism==
Post-Fordism brought on new ways of looking at consumption and production. The saturation of key markets brought on a turn against mass consumption and a pursuit of higher living standards. This shift brought a change in how the market was viewed from a production standpoint. Rather than being viewed as a mass market to be served by mass production, the consumers began to be viewed as different groups pursuing different goals who could be better served with small batches of specialized goods. Mass markets became less important while markets for luxury, custom, or positional goods became more significant. Production became less homogeneous and standardized and more diverse and differentiated as organizations and economies of scale were replaced with organizations and economies of scope.

The changes in production with the shift from Fordism to post-Fordism were accompanied by changes in the economy, politics, and prominent ideologies. In the economic realm, post-Fordism brought the decline of regulation and production by the nation-state and the rise of global markets and corporations. Mass marketing was replaced by flexible specialization, and organizations began to emphasize communication more than command. The workforce changed with an increase in internal marketing, franchising, and subcontracting and a rise in part-time, temp, self-employed, and home workers. Politically, class-based political parties declined and social movements based on region, gender, or race increased. Mass unions began to vanish and were instead replaced by localized plant-based bargaining. Cultural and ideological changes included the rise in individualist modes of thought and behavior and a culture of entrepreneurialism. Following the shift in production and acknowledging the need for more knowledge-based workers, education became less standardized and more specialized. Prominent ideologies that arose included fragmentation and pluralism in values, post-modern eclecticism, and populist approaches to culture.

==Examples==

===Italy===
One of the primary examples of specialized post-Fordist production took place in a region known as the Third Italy. The First Italy included the areas of large-scale mass production, such as Turin, Milan, and Genoa, and the Second Italy described the undeveloped South. The Third Italy, however, was where clusters of small firms and workshops developed in the 1970s and 1980s in the central and northeast regions of the country. Regions of the Third Italy included Tuscany, Umbria, Marche, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli, and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. Each region specialized in a range of loosely related products and each workshop usually had five to fifty workers and often less than ten. The range of products in each region reflected the post-Fordist shift to economies of scope. Additionally, these workshops were known for producing high quality products and employing highly skilled, well-paid workers. The workshops were very design-oriented and multidisciplinary, involving collaboration between entrepreneurs, designers, engineers and workers.

===Japan===
There were several post-World War II changes in production in Japan that caused post-Fordist conditions to develop. First, there were changes to company structure, including the replacement of independent trade unions with pro-management, company-based unions; the development of a core of permanent male multi-skilled workers; and the development of a periphery of untrained temporary and part-time employees, who were mostly female. Second, after World War II, Japan was somewhat isolated because of import barriers and foreign investment restrictions, and as a result, Japan began to experiment with production techniques. Third, as imported technologies became more available, Japan began to replicate, absorb, and improve them, with many improvements deriving from modifications for local conditions. Fourth, Japan began to concentrate on the need for small-batch production and quick changeover of product lines to serve the demand for a wide range of products in a relatively small market. Because of informal price-fixing, competition was based not on price but rather on product differentiation. As a result, production became less standardized and more specialized, particularly across different companies. Fifth, Japan began to build long-term supply and subcontracting networks, which contrasted with the vertically integrated, Fordist American corporations. Sixth, because small and medium-size manufacturers produced a wide range of products, there was a need for affordable multipurpose equipment as opposed to the specialized, costly production machinery in Fordist industries in the United States. Technology for flexible production was significant in Japan and particularly necessary for smaller producers. The smaller producers also found it necessary to reduce costs. As a result, Japan became one of the main users of robots and CNC. Over time, these six changes in production in Japan were institutionalized.

==Criticisms==
The main criticism of post-Fordism asserts that post-Fordism mistakes the nature of the Fordist revolution and that Fordism was not in crisis, but was simply evolving and will continue to evolve. Other critics believe that post-Fordism does exist, but coexists with Fordism. The automobile industry has combined Fordist and post-Fordist strategies, using both mass production and flexible specialization. Ford introduced flexibility into mass production, so that Fordism could continue to evolve. Those who advocate post-Fordism, however, note that criticism that focuses primarily on flexible specialization ignores post-Fordist changes in other areas of life and that flexible specialization cannot be looked at alone when examining post-Fordism. Another criticism is that post-Fordism relies too heavily on the examples of the Third Italy and Japan. Some believe that Japan is neither Fordist nor post-Fordist and that vertical disintegration and mass production go hand in hand. Others argue that the new, smaller firms in Italy did not develop autonomously, but are a product of the vertical disintegration of the large Fordist firms who contracted lower value-added work to smaller enterprises. Other criticisms argue that flexible specialization is not happening on any great scale, and smaller firms have always existed alongside mass production. Another main criticism is that we are too much in the midst to judge whether or not there really is a new system of production.

The term &quot;post-Fordism&quot; is gradually giving way in the literature to a series of alternative terms such as the knowledge economy, cognitive capitalism, the cognitive-cultural economy and so on. This change of vocabulary is also associated with a number of important conceptual shifts (see sections above).

<text>Gary R. Roberts (born May 23, 1966) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played 21 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Calgary Flames, Carolina Hurricanes, Toronto Maple Leafs, Florida Panthers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Tampa Bay Lightning. Renowned for his physical fitness during his career, Roberts has become a high performance trainer for players at all levels of the sport.

Roberts was a member of Memorial Cup and Minto Cup winning teams as Canadian junior hockey and box lacrosse champions, respectively. He was a first round selection of the Calgary Flames, 12th overall, at the 1984 NHL Entry Draft and played ten seasons in Calgary. Roberts was a member of the Flames&#x27; 1989 Stanley Cup championship team and made two of his three NHL All-Star Game appearances as a representative of the team. A serious neck injury forced him to miss the majority of two seasons, and while his return earned him the 1996 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance and dedication to the game, he was forced into retirement following the 1995–96 season.

After sitting out a full season, Roberts successfully returned to the NHL in 1997 as a member of the Carolina Hurricanes, with whom he played three seasons. Stints in Toronto, Florida and Pittsburgh followed, and Roberts ended his career in 2009 as a member of the Tampa Bay Lightning. He played 11 seasons following his comeback, finishing with 1,224 games played, 438 goals, and 910 points.

==Early life==
Roberts was born on May 23, 1966, in Toronto, Ontario, but grew up in Whitby. His best friend growing up was future NHL teammate Joe Nieuwendyk; the pair played minor hockey together in the winter, and box lacrosse in the summer. Roberts played Junior A lacrosse with the Whitby Warriors in the mid-1980s, with whom he won a Minto Cup, the Canadian junior championship.

==Playing career==
===Junior===
In junior hockey, Roberts was drafted into the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). He joined the Ottawa 67&#x27;s in 1982–83 and scored 20 points in 53 games. Roberts improved to 57 points in his second season and added 17 points in 13 playoff games. The 67&#x27;s reached the OHL final and defeated the Kitchener Rangers to win the J. Ross Robertson Cup. The victory advanced the 67&#x27;s to the 1984 Memorial Cup tournament where Ottawa reached the final. They again faced Kitchener, who were the tournament hosts, and won the national championship with a 7–2 victory. Following the season, the Calgary Flames selected Roberts with their first round selection, 12th overall, at the 1984 NHL Entry Draft.

Returned by the Flames to Ottawa for his third junior season in 1984–85, Roberts served as the team&#x27;s captain. He recorded 106 points, including 44 goals, and was named to the OHL&#x27;s second All-Star Team. Entering a rebuilding phase, the 67&#x27;s were quickly eliminated from the playoffs, after which the Flames assigned Roberts to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Moncton Golden Flames. In his first professional stint, Roberts scored four goals and added two assists in seven games. Roberts returned to Ottawa for a final junior season in 1985–86, a season in which he played with the Canadian junior team at the 1986 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Roberts finished second on the team with six goals for the silver medal-winning Canadians. In the OHL, he split the season between the last place 67&#x27;s and, following a trade, the Guelph Platers. Roberts finished with 84 points combined between the two teams, and helped the Platers record a record in the playoffs and lead Guelph past the Belleville Bulls to win the OHL championship. He scored four goals in four games at the 1986 Memorial Cup, and the Platers defeated the Hull Olympiques, 6–2 in the final. Roberts ended his junior career as a two-time Memorial Cup champion.

===Calgary Flames===

In his first professional season, 1986–87, Roberts shuttled between Calgary and Moncton. He was recalled to the Flames three times during the season and scored his first NHL goal in his NHL debut on November 11, 1986, against the Vancouver Canucks. He recorded 15 points in 32 games with Calgary and added 38 points in 38 AHL games with Moncton. In his first full season in Calgary, 1987–88, Roberts improved to 28 points in 74 NHL games, while his 282 penalty minutes were ultimately the highest total of his career, and the first of five consecutive seasons which he recorded over 200 minutes in penalties. Roberts joined the Flames as a grinder; He played a physical style and frequently engaged opponents in fights, but credited Nieuwendyk with helping him establish his place as a power forward and offensive threat with the team. Playing on a line with Nieuwendyk and Håkan Loob, Roberts scored 22 goals in 1988–89. He added 12 points in the 1989 Stanley Cup Playoffs, including two goals in the Flames&#x27; 5–3 victory in the fourth game of the Smythe Division final that eliminated the Los Angeles Kings. Roberts and the Flames went on to defeat the Montreal Canadiens in the final to earn the franchise&#x27;s first Stanley Cup championship.

Developing into an offensive leader, Roberts scored more goals (39) in 1989–90 than he had points (38) the previous season. He scored his first career hat trick in a 6–2 win over the Edmonton Oilers on March 30, 1990. After regressing to 22 goals and 53 points in 1990–91, Roberts set career highs in 1991–92 with 53 goals and 90 points. Both totals led the Flames and 53 goals remains the second highest single-season total in Flames history, behind Lanny McDonald&#x27;s 66 goals in 1982–83. He played in his first NHL All-Star Game in 1992, and became one of the first two players in NHL history to score 50 goals and record 200 penalty minutes in the same season (along with Kevin Stevens of the Pittsburgh Penguins).

Roberts tied a Flames franchise record with goals in eight consecutive games in 1992–93, a streak that came to an end when he suffered a quadriceps injury that caused him to miss 25 games. He finished the season with 79 points in 58 games, and appeared in his second All-Star Game. Healthy for most of the 1993–94 season, Roberts led the Flames with 41 goals. He missed the final two weeks due to damage to nerves in his neck, an injury he had experienced previously in his career. The injury worsened in the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season as he appeared in only eight games. Degeneration of the nerves in his neck left Roberts unable to lift a dumbbell above his shoulder with his left arm.

The injury was considered career threatening and required two surgeries, in March and October 1995, to repair. After missing the first half of the 1995–96 season, Roberts made his return on January 10, 1996, against the Hartford Whalers. The fans greeted him with a standing ovation and he responded by scoring a goal and throwing several bodychecks in the game. Although he played only 35 games, Roberts scored 22 goals and had 42 points. His return and performance earned him the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance and dedication to the game. The problems with his neck failed to abate however, and on June 17, 1996, Roberts elected to retire from the NHL at the age of 30.

===Carolina and Toronto===
Several months after retiring, Roberts was put in touch with Dr. Michael Leahy, a chiropractor from Colorado, whose &quot;active release technique&quot; of physiotherapy led to an immediate improvement in his mobility. Determined to try and resume his career, Roberts then spent most of the next year with a physical therapist learning a new training regimen. After sitting out the entire 1996–97 season, Roberts announced his return to the NHL. He remained a member of the Flames, but the team agreed to trade him to an Eastern team to reduce strain due to travel. The Flames dealt Roberts, along with goaltender Trevor Kidd, to the Carolina Hurricanes on August 25, 1997, in exchange for Andrew Cassels and Jean-Sébastien Giguère.

In his return season of 1997–98, Roberts recorded 49 points in 61 games. He dropped to 42 points in 1998–99, but finished fifth in team scoring to help Carolina win a Southeast Division championship. He scored his first playoff goal in five years in Carolina&#x27;s first round series against the Boston Bruins, though the Hurricanes ultimately lost the series in six games. Roberts scored 53 points in 1999–2000 before leaving Carolina as a free agent.

Returning to Canada, Roberts signed a three-year, $8 million contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. He chose his hometown Maple Leafs because he felt they had a better opportunity to win the Stanley Cup than Carolina did. He recorded 53 points in 2000–01 and his 29 goals led the team. A 48-point season followed in 2001–02 and he assumed leadership of the Maple Leafs during the 2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs after team captain Mats Sundin suffered an injury. Roberts led Toronto past their first round opponent, the New York Islanders, in an occasionally violent seven game series. Roberts contributed to this violence in game five, with a hit that drove Kenny Jonsson into the boards head-first, leading to a season-ending concussion for Jonsson. Roberts was assessed a major penalty, but, surprisingly, was not suspended. The Maple Leafs reached the Eastern Conference final, where they ultimately lost to Carolina. Roberts led Toronto in playoff scoring with 19 points in 19 games.

Playing a physical style again took its toll on Roberts&#x27; upper body, and he required surgery on both shoulders following the season. As a result, he missed the first four and a half months of the 2002–03 season; he appeared in only 14 games for Toronto. The Maple Leafs signed him to a one-year contract extension shortly after he returned from the injury. Roberts reached a career milestone midway through the 2003–04 season, as he played his 1,000th NHL game on January 13, 2004, a 4–1 victory over the Calgary Flames. He finished the season with 48 points in 72 games and played in his third All-Star Game.

===Florida, Pittsburgh and Tampa Bay===

While the NHL was shut down due to a labour dispute in 2004–05, the National Lacrosse League (NLL)&#x27;s Calgary Roughnecks selected Roberts in the sixth round of the 2004 NLL Draft, partially as a public relations stunt. He declined the chance to play professional lacrosse. When NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Roberts and Nieuwendyk each signed a two-year deal with the Florida Panthers. The pair, who were teammates in Toronto as well as Calgary, hoped to end their careers together in Florida. It did not happen, as chronic back pain forced Nieuwendyk&#x27;s retirement in December 2006.

Roberts did not last much longer in Florida as, following a 40-point season in 2005–06, the Panthers sought to trade him to the Pittsburgh Penguins late in the 2006–07 season. Several members of the Penguins, including Mario Lemieux and general manager Ray Shero, sought to convince Roberts to agree to the deal as he was initially unsure about leaving Florida but ultimately agreed to the trade. The deal was completed at the February 27, 2007, trade deadline as Pittsburgh sent prospect Noah Welch to Florida in exchange for Roberts. He was brought in to add a leadership presence to a young Penguins team. He finished the regular season with 13 points in 19 games in Pittsburgh and helped the Penguins reach the playoffs for the first time in six years.

Injuries again hampered Roberts in 2007–08. He missed time early in the season due to a viral infection, then broke his left fibula in a game against the Buffalo Sabres. He was praised for skating off the ice without assistance despite the injury, but missed over two months of action while his leg healed. Appearing in only 38 games during the regular season, Roberts returned from the injury in time to score two goals and lead Pittsburgh to a victory in the first game of its opening round playoff series against the Ottawa Senators. At 41 years, 322 days old, he became the oldest player in NHL history to score more than one goal in a post-season game. He added two assists in ten additional playoff games for the Penguins.

Pittsburgh opted not to re-sign Roberts to a new contract following the season and traded both him and Ryan Malone – who was also a pending free agent – to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for a third round draft pick on June 28, 2008. The deal gave Tampa Bay a brief window in which they had exclusive rights to negotiate a contract. He agreed to a one-year contract with the Lightning. Another injury, to his elbow, caused Roberts to miss 33 games of the 2008–09 season. He played only 30 games and recorded seven points. The Lightning placed him on waivers as the 2009 trade deadline approached, but no team claimed him. Nine days after playing his final NHL game, an 8–6 win in Calgary where he recorded an assist, Roberts announced his retirement on March 10, 2009.

==Fitness and training==
Roberts entered his first NHL training camp with the Flames in 1984 believing his summer lacrosse schedule was enough to keep him in proper hockey game shape. Coach Bob Johnson disagreed and hauled him in front of his peers as an example of someone who had not committed to being a hockey player. He was initially upset, but grew to realize that Johnson was correct, in that he was not particularly focused on his fitness. The criticism inspired Roberts to dedicate himself to personal training, and carried a reputation for being obsessed with nutrition and physical fitness throughout his career. He credited his fitness and nutrition regimen with helping him extend his career another 13 years after his first retirement.

As a player, Roberts helped train his peers during off-seasons. He was a member of the Dallas Stars&#x27; staff as the team&#x27;s player development consultant during the 2010–11 NHL season. One of Roberts&#x27; early disciples, Tampa&#x27;s Steven Stamkos, developed into a 50-goal player in his first season after training with Roberts and led to numerous players seeking to train with him. His growing reputation as a personal trainer led to the creation of the Gary Roberts High Performance Centre and Fitness Institute in Toronto, Ontario where he trains junior and professional players, including several in the NHL.

==Personal life==
Roberts has been married twice and has four children. He and his first wife Tamra have a daughter. The couple were divorced while Roberts was a member of the Maple Leafs. With his second wife, Michelle, he has two sons and a daughter. Michelle assists her husband at the training centre. Roberts hosts an annual charity golf tournament in Uxbridge, Ontario, in support of Canadian Tire&#x27;s Jumpstart program, which helps young people get involved in sports. He is an honoured member of the Whitby Sports Hall of Fame, inducted in 2010. Roberts coached his son&#x27;s minor hockey team, the Central Ontario Wolves, in 2005.

==Notes==
* Sources state that Roberts was a member of one Minto Cup winning team, but disagree on the year. Some claim he won in 1984, others 1985. Records, with photo, in the Archives of the Whitby Library show Roberts as a member of the 1985 Minto Cup-winning team.

<text>Panopeus herbstii, also known as the black-fingered mud crab, black-clawed mud crab, Atlantic mud crab or sometimes common mud crab, is a species of true crab, belonging to the infraorder Brachyura, and is the largest of the mud crabs.

&quot;Panopeus herbstii&quot; is small, growing to about 4 cm, with black-tipped claws of unequal size. &quot;P. herbstii&quot; has a strong exoskeleton, with very thick and strong claws. The shell is a dull gray and brown color.

&quot;Panopeus herbstii&quot; is found along the Atlantic coast of North America, from Boston, Massachusetts to Santa Catarina, Brazil and on Bermuda. It is the most common xanthid crab on the east coast of the United States. It is found on muddy bottoms, where it takes refuge under stones and shells or among sponges and weeds, but it is rarely seen in the open. It feeds mainly on young clams, oysters, and periwinkles; it cracks open their shells with its strong claws. Mud crabs are especially fond of hermit crabs, which are grasped by the legs and pulled out of their protective shells. Like most mud crabs, it is a scavenger. Young &quot;P. herbstii&quot; are an important food source to other marine animals. It mainly eats oysters.

<text>Jeremy Shaffer Roenick ( ; born January 17, 1970) is an American former professional ice hockey player who played the majority of his career in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted 8th overall in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft by the Chicago Blackhawks, for whom he played from 1988 to 1996. Roenick subsequently played for the Phoenix Coyotes, Philadelphia Flyers, Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks over the course of his twenty season career in the league. He also represented Team USA in several international tournaments. On November 10, 2007, he became the third American-born player (Joe Mullen and Mike Modano were the first two) to score 500 goals. He is one of 46 players to have scored 500 goals. After retiring in 2009, Roenick joined NBC Sports as a hockey analyst from 2010–2020. Roenick was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2024.

==Playing career==
===Amateur career===
Roenick began playing hockey at age four when the parents of a playmate persuaded Roenick&#x27;s parents to put Jeremy in a hockey program so that their child would be with someone he knew. The son of a Mobil oil district coordinator, Jeremy constantly moved around the Northeastern United States, joining new hockey teams with each stop. As a youth, Roenick played in the 1982 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Middlesex County, Connecticut, and in the 1983 tournament with the Washington Capitals minor ice hockey team.

Roenick then moved to Fairfax, Virginia, where he traveled to play for the bantam-level New Jersey Rockets, who had won back-to-back national championships in 1984–85 and 1985–86. At age 14, Roenick was required to take a flight from Dulles Airport to Newark, New Jersey, on a weekly basis to make the Rockets&#x27; games. Roenick helped the Rockets to a state championship, registering 300 points in only 75 games. After one year of traveling for hockey, the Roenick family would move back to Massachusetts, where Jeremy enrolled at Thayer Academy. Roenick played on the same line as future NHL line-mate Tony Amonte; the two went on to win two League Championships.

Roenick was so impressive during his time at Thayer Academy he was drafted straight out of high school, going eighth overall in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft to the Chicago Blackhawks. He was also taken to breakfast by Wayne Gretzky in an attempt to convince Roenick to play for the Hull Olympiques, a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) team Gretzky owned. Roenick played for the Olympiques during the 1988–89 season scoring 70 points in 28 games, before going on to represent the United States at the 1989 World Junior Championship. In his second World Junior Championship, Roenick led the tournament in scoring and was named a Tournament All-Star. Roenick&#x27;s line, which included future NHL players Mike Modano and John LeClair, totaled 41 points, the most ever by a Team USA line and sixth most in tournament history. Despite his scoring success, the United States finished the tournament in fifth place. During the tournament, Roenick become the all-time leading American scorer, totaling 25 points. Roenick&#x27;s record stood for 21 years before being broken by Jordan Schroeder in 2010. However, it took Schroeder three tournaments to pass Roenick, who set the record in just two events. Following Roenick&#x27;s successful World Junior performance, the Blackhawks called him up during the 1988–89 season.

===Chicago Blackhawks (1988–1996)===
Roenick made his NHL debut on October 6, 1988, against the New York Rangers and then scored his first goal on February 14, 1989, against the Minnesota North Stars. In 20 games at the NHL level, Roenick scored 18 points. In the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs, he helped the Blackhawks reach the Conference Finals. During the playoffs, Roenick gave the Chicago fans a glimpse of what kind of player he would become. In a game against the St. Louis Blues, Roenick got into an altercation with Blues&#x27; defenseman Glen Featherstone. Featherstone crosschecked Roenick in the mouth and broke his front teeth; Featherstone would be given a five-minute major penalty, while Roenick received a minor penalty. Roenick remained in the game and once his penalty expired, he took a shift on the power play and scored a goal.

In the 1989–90 season, Roenick joined the Blackhawks full-time and helped the team improve by 22 points to win the Norris Division title; he scored 26 goals and 66 points in the regular season. During the 1990 playoffs, Roenick helped the Blackhawks reach the Campbell Conference Finals before losing to the Edmonton Oilers. He scored 18 points in 20 games. The Blackhawks&#x27; confidence in Roenick&#x27;s abilities allowed them to trade star forward Denis Savard for defenseman Chris Chelios in June 1990.

In 1990–91, Roenick paced the team with ten game-winning goals as the Blackhawks improved another 18 points to win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy. Roenick finished second on the team with 41 goals, 53 assists and 94 points and played in his first NHL All-Star Game. In six playoff games, he scored eight points. The following year, Roenick led the team with 53 goals, 50 assists and 103 points and played in his second All-Star Game. While the team dropped to second in the Norris Division during the regular season, they marched all the way to the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals in the playoffs. Roenick scored 22 points in 18 games as the team captured the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl over Edmonton before getting swept by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the final round.

In 1992–93, Roenick led the Blackhawks with 50 goals, 107 points and 22 power-play goals as the team improved 19 points to win their third Norris Division title in four years (47 wins, 106 points). During the season, Roenick played in his third All-Star Game. In the playoffs, he scored three points in four games as the Blackhawks were swept by the St. Louis Blues. At year&#x27;s end, he ranked tenth on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; Top-25 Players list.

In 1993–94, Roenick again led his team with 46 goals, a career-high 61 assists, 107 points, a career-high 24 power-play goals, five shorthanded goals and a +21 plus-minus rating as the Blackhawks fell back 19 points in the standings. He also played in his fourth mid-season All-Star Game. In the post-season, he scored seven points in six playoff games. At year&#x27;s end, he ranked tenth on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; Top-40 Players list. He also won the Chicago Sports Profiles Humanitarian of the Year Award.

In the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, Roenick scored 34 points in 33 games. He missed 15 games with a bruised tibia. He played eight games in the 1995 playoffs as the Blackhawks reached the Western Conference Final, where they fell to the Detroit Red Wings. In 1995–96, Roenick scored 67 points in 66 games before missing the last 11 games with a sprained ankle. At year&#x27;s end, he was the team&#x27;s leader with 32 goals.

===Phoenix Coyotes (1996–2001)===
On August 16, 1996, Roenick was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for Alexei Zhamnov, Craig Mills and a first-round draft pick (Ty Jones). As the number 27 he wore in Chicago was already worn by (and would eventually be retired for) Teppo Numminen, Roenick chose number 97, becoming the first player in NHL history to wear number 97. In his first season with his new team, Roenick scored 29 goals and 69 points. In 1997–98, he finished second on the team with 56 points. In 1998–99, he led the Coyotes with 72 points and played in his fifth All-Star Game while also knocking 154 hits. In 1999–2000, Roenick again led the Coyotes in scoring, this time racking up 34 goals and 44 assists for 78 points. He tallied 125 hits on the season and played in his sixth All-Star Game. In 2000–01, Roenick led the Coyotes with 30 goals and 76 points. He played 80 games and registered 133 hits.

===Philadelphia Flyers (2001–2005)===
On July 2, 2001, Roenick signed a five-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers. In his first season with the Flyers, he won both the Bobby Clarke Trophy (MVP) and Yanick Dupre Memorial (Class Guy) team awards. He led the team with 46 assists, 67 points and a +32 plus-minus rating as the Flyers won the Atlantic Division title. On January 30, he scored his 1,000th NHL point in a game against the Ottawa Senators. Three nights later, he played in the mid-season All-Star Game. In the 2002 playoffs, Roenick played five games in an opening-round loss to the Senators.

In 2002–03, Roenick led the Flyers with 27 goals and 59 points as the team won 45 games and finished second in the Atlantic Division. He also co-led the Flyers with 32 assists and eight power-play goals. On November 16, Roenick played in his 1,000th NHL game. In February, he played in the mid-season All-Star Game. In the 2003 playoffs, he scored eight points in 13 games as the Flyers reached the second round before again losing to the Ottawa Senators.

On February 12, 2004, during a game against the New York Rangers, Roenick was hit in the face by an errant slapshot from the Rangers&#x27; defenseman Boris Mironov. The force of the shot broke Roenick&#x27;s jaw in 19 places and knocked him unconscious for several minutes as he lay on the ice in a pool of blood. Roenick suffered his ninth concussion on the play, and there was concern that he had suffered damage to his brain&#x27;s circulatory system, in addition to the broken jaw, leading him to consider retirement. However, further testing revealed no circulatory damage and Roenick returned ahead of schedule, after missing more than a month of hockey due to the concussion and broken jaw, with less than two weeks left in the season. In 2003–04, Roenick was limited to 62 games, but still scored 47 points as the Flyers won their third division title in five years. He finished second on the team with a .76 points-per-game average. In the 2004 playoffs, Roenick helped the Flyers reach the Eastern Conference Finals, scoring four goals and 13 points, including the series-clinching overtime goal in game six of the second round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Flyers, however, lost in the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Tampa Bay Lightning.

===Los Angeles Kings (2005–2006)===

Following the NHL Lockout, the Flyers surprised everyone by signing Peter Forsberg on August 3, 2005. In order to clear salary cap space for Forsberg&#x27;s contract, Roenick was traded the next day to the Los Angeles Kings.

Roenick&#x27;s 2005–06 season with the Kings was greatly disappointing, both for Roenick and for the team. He managed just 22 points in 58 games, his lowest total since he scored 18 points in 20 games in his rookie season. It was a trying season for Roenick, who missed time due to a broken finger suffered while blocking a shot during a penalty kill, played games late in the season after suffering a chip fracture in his right ankle and, the concussion suffered from the slapshot had changed Roenick&#x27;s game making him a tentative player. Roenick was displeased with his performances stating in an almost apologetic way: &quot;I went to LA to finish off the last year of my contract and had a year off playing [lockout] and it was a really difficult year for me, it was hard mentally. A lot of people don&#x27;t realize that for six months I had a lot of problems with the concussions and battling the jaw injury…&quot;

Becoming a free agent at the end of his first season in Los Angeles, he expressed strong interest in joining a Canadian team. &quot;It was a nightmare season from hell last year,&quot; Roenick said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always said I would like to play in Canada before my career is over.&quot;

===Return to Phoenix Coyotes (2006–2007)===
Instead, Roenick signed a one-year, $1.2 million contract, on July 4, 2006, that brought him back to the Phoenix Coyotes. In Phoenix for his second tenure, he scored 28 points in 70 games, a relatively low scoring season for him. His second stint in Phoenix was not without its share of off-ice issues as well. On December 12, 2006, Roenick left General Motors Place in Vancouver after finding out he had been scratched from the game&#x27;s line-up against the Vancouver Canucks. Roenick went on record saying he left the arena to go to a restaurant for what he called &quot;a nice dinner&quot;. At the heart of the problem was that Roenick felt that he was healthy enough to play in the game following a back injury, while Coyotes head coach Wayne Gretzky felt he needed more time to recover. Roenick&#x27;s antics led to him being benched again in the Coyotes&#x27; next game. The next time Roenick was scratched, he was more accepting of Gretzky&#x27;s decision, stating a different mindset following the news that his daughter, Brandi, had been diagnosed with the kidney ailment IgA nephropathy.

===San Jose Sharks (2007–2009)===

After his low-scoring campaign in Phoenix, there was speculation Roenick would retire. Indeed, on July 4, 2007, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported Roenick sent them a text message announcing his retirement from the NHL. However, later that month, Roenick&#x27;s agent, Neil Abbott, released a statement indicating the &quot;text message retirement&quot; announcement by the Philadelphia newspaper had been premature, and that Roenick would be making a decision on his future within the next month.

On September 4, 2007, it was confirmed Roenick had signed a one-year, $500,000 contract with the San Jose Sharks to fill the role of checking line center. Roenick credited Sharks&#x27; general manager Doug Wilson, his former roommate when they played together in Chicago, with giving him another chance at hockey.

One month into his first season with San Jose, on November 10, Roenick scored his 500th goal, coming against his former team, the Phoenix Coyotes – an unassisted mark from center ice that bounced off the end boards, then hitting the side of the net. Goaltender Alex Auld attempted to clear the puck out of the crease from the side of the goal mouth, but accidentally bumped the puck off the heel of his goalie stick into the net. Roenick became the third American-born player to reach the 500-goal plateau, joining Mike Modano and Joe Mullen.
On January 10, 2008, Roenick scored his 503rd goal, against the Vancouver Canucks, passing Joe Mullen for second in all-time scoring by American-born players. As the Sharks entered the 2008 playoffs against the Calgary Flames, Roenick displayed an inspired Game 7 performance, scoring two goals and two assists to eliminate Calgary. However, after advancing to the second round to face Mike Modano and the Dallas Stars in the second round, the Sharks were eliminated in six games. Roenick also finished the season with ten game-winning goals.

On June 25, 2008, Roenick re-signed with the Sharks to a one-year, $1.1 million contract, doubling his previous year&#x27;s salary.

On February 21, 2009, Roenick recorded his 700th career assist, against the Atlanta Thrashers, by setting up a goal by Jonathan Cheechoo. He is the 48th player in NHL history, and the sixth American-born player, to reach that threshold.

===Retirement===
On August 6, 2009, Roenick announced his retirement from the NHL and professional hockey. Roenick finished his career having scored 513 goals and 703 assists in 1,363 games for a total of 1,216 points. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 11, 2024.

==Personality==
Roenick was known for giving back to the fans. Whether it was signing autographs for fans by the players entrance or who came up to him on the street, Roenick regularly attempted to establish good rapport with the fans. For Roenick, it was an understanding of what it meant to be the fan on the other side. As a child, he attended Hartford Whalers&#x27; games; during one visit, hockey legend Gordie Howe picked up a pile of snow off the ice and threw it over the glass and on top of Roenick&#x27;s head; Howe then continued to skate around but looked at Roenick again and winked. Roenick recalled what a lasting effect it had on him, noting, &quot;I thought that was the coolest thing that ever happened in my whole life, it took three seconds. It was me, Gordie Howe and no one else...That moment stuck with me for years and years and years. It was little, it was small and it took nothing out of his power or time but it resonated with me my whole life. So, as a player, as I got older, I tried to reach out to fans, reach out to kids whether on the ice or on the street or in a restaurant. I try to do little things where I can make the same impression on a young child that Gordie Howe made on me. That&#x27;s a gift that was given to me. And I made sure I did it, every, single day. Without the fans, without their support, the NHL would be nothing, the NFL would be nothing, basketball, baseball, you name it right down the line ... The two or three seconds you give each day to make sure you appreciate the people who appreciate you, goes a long way.&quot;

Even with his giving back to the fans, Roenick was better known for his mouth, always willing to speak his mind. He was always a popular interview for reporters, one of a few players who spoke from the heart and never shied away from taking on the heads of the game, whether it was the NHL commissioner or the leadership of the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA).

It was Roenick&#x27;s willingness to talk that got him into a famous trade of quotations in 1996. In the 1996 Western Conference Semi-finals between the Colorado Avalanche and the Chicago Blackhawks, after a controversial game in which Roenick was tripped on a breakaway and no penalty shot was called, Patrick Roy said, &quot;I would have saved it anyway.&quot; Roenick responded in another interview, &quot;I&#x27;d like to know where Patrick was in Game 3 (a game in which Roenick had scored on Patrick Roy on a similar breakaway); probably up trying to get his jock out of the rafters.&quot; When later asked about Roenick&#x27;s comments Roy retorted, &quot;I cannot really hear what Jeremy says because I&#x27;ve got my two Stanley Cup rings plugging my ears.&quot;

===Controversies===
Roenick&#x27;s openness has often led to controversy. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he addressed certain fans that perceive NHL players as being spoiled. Roenick told these fans to &quot;kiss my ass&quot; and accused them of being jealous. He stated further he would prefer that those fans who shared that perception no longer attend NHL games or watch them on television. Afterwards, Roenick felt his remarks had been taken out of context by ESPN.

Following the loss of the 2004–05 season to a labor dispute, Roenick found himself at odds with the Philadelphia Flyers. He claimed to be suffering from a concussion despite the Flyers&#x27; doctors having cleared him following his exit physical. Under the terms of the NHL collective bargaining agreement, injured players from the previous season were still to be paid during the lockout (Roenick&#x27;s contract was for $7.5 million in 2004–05). After several trips to different doctors the Flyers and Roenick finally settled on a payment between $1.09 million and $1.5 million for games he would have missed due to post-concussion syndrome if there had been no lockout.

Roenick was suspended for one game during the 2003–04 season for throwing a water bottle at an official.

Roenick&#x27;s penchant for stirring controversy also saw him claiming in 2006 that USA Hockey has &quot;blackballed&quot; him, and was being disrespectful by not including him on the American national team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He claimed, &quot;I&#x27;m a lot better player than my points indicate&quot;; he had 6 goals and 7 assists in 32 games when he made that comment.

In May 2009, Roenick claimed Chris Chelios, then a member of the Detroit Red Wings, was receiving less playing time because Mike Babcock, Detroit&#x27;s head coach, was biased against American players. Chelios and Babcock dismissed the allegations, stating there was no tension between them.

Roenick returned to questioning American Olympic selections prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. During an interview with Toronto-based radio station AM640, Roenick publicly questioned the selection of Chris Drury to the Olympic team. Roenick felt Drury was not as good for the team as Scott Gomez or T. J. Oshie (who were not selected) in terms of on-ice play. Roenick also felt Drury&#x27;s main role was to be a leader to the young Americans and that Mike Modano was a better choice to fill that role for the Olympic team. Drury scored a key goal in the team in the U.S.&#x27; win over Canada during the preliminary round, and Roenick later issued a public apology to Drury.

On February 8, 2006, &quot;The Star Ledger&quot; reported Roenick had been identified as one of several NHL players implicated in Operation Slapshot – an operation created with the intent to uncover a nationwide gambling ring. Other notable names involved in this investigation are former Phoenix Coyotes assistant coach and former Tampa Bay Lightning head coach Rick Tocchet, and the wife of Wayne Gretzky, Janet Jones. Roenick was required to provide an affidavit to the New Jersey authorities for allegedly placing bets. It was the second time Roenick had been investigated for his gambling. In 2004, Roenick came under investigation after paying a Florida sports-gambling operation between $50,000 and $100,000 for betting tips and services. However, at the time, the NHL did not prohibit players from betting on sports, other than hockey, and Roenick stated he stopped gambling after a warning from Philadelphia Flyers general manager Bobby Clarke.

On January 25, 2017, Roenick was arrested in New York after police discovered he was driving with a suspended license during a routine traffic stop. Roenick claimed New York&#x27;s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) was sending mail to an address he had not lived at since 1989. He commented on the experience stating, &quot;I&#x27;m out $750. Not only my time. Plus I got arrested. Plus I sat in a jail cell with cokeheads. Plus I sat in the courtroom with real criminals. I&#x27;ve never been arrested before in my life!&quot;

On December 23, 2019, NBC suspended Roenick indefinitely for making inappropriate comments about coworkers Kathryn Tappen, Patrick Sharp, and Anson Carter during an interview on the Spittin&#x27; Chiclets podcast. The comments included joking about having a threesome with Tappen. NBC fired Roenick after his suspension ended in February 2020.

In July 2020, Roenick filed a lawsuit against NBC Sports for wrongful termination, arguing that he was discriminated against as a straight, white man and as a supporter of President Donald Trump. The lawsuit alleged that NBC Sports had committed a contractual breach by firing him without a proper cause and by not providing Roenick a reasonable opportunity to address the incident.

==Media==
On April 11, 2007, Roenick made his debut as a Stanley Cup playoffs hockey analyst on TSN, a cable sports broadcast network in Canada. In 2007, Roenick also co-hosted two episodes of &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show...Period&quot; which aired on Fox Sports Net, it is unclear if this role would have become a permanent role had Roenick not signed with the San Jose Sharks.

In October 2009, TSN&#x27;s &quot;Off the Record&quot; announced an agreement that has Roenick appearing on the show as a regular contributor. Roenick&#x27;s recurring segment has been named &quot;Oh JR! with Jeremy Roenick&quot;.

Roenick joined NBC Sports Group in 2010 and serves as a studio analyst for NBC Sports Group&#x27;s NHL coverage on NHL Live and NHL Overtime, NBCSN&#x27;s pre- and post-game shows alongside studio host Kathryn Tappen. In addition to his regular role on NHL Live, Roenick has served as a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Olympic hockey analyst at the past three Winter Olympics. As an analyst for the NBC family of networks coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics, in Vancouver, he acted as the counterpart for Mike Milbury. In the post-game show of the Canada–Russia quarterfinal, Milbury said Russia brought their &quot;Eurotrash game&quot;. Co-host Bill Patrick asked Milbury, &quot;Did you really say &#x27;Eurotrash&#x27;? Did that come out of your mouth?&quot; Roenick&#x27;s face showed his surprise as he said, &quot;I heard it. I heard it.&quot;

Roenick was also an analyst for NBC during the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, where, after his two former teams the Chicago Blackhawks and Philadelphia Flyers battled for the Stanley Cup, he became overwhelmed emotionally, barely holding back tears and addressing the victorious Blackhawks organization and their fans by saying, &quot;For the kid who was there in 1992 who was crying when I came off the ice in after we lost Game 4 at Chicago Stadium—you waited 18 years. I hope you have a big smile on your face. Congratulations.&quot; When pressed further about his emotional state, Roenick appeared to have trouble putting his emotions into words and simply replied, &quot;I&#x27;m proud, I&#x27;m happy. I&#x27;m proud.&quot;

In September 2010, it was announced Roenick would become a regular judge on the second season of CBC&#x27;s reality program &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;, which pairs ex-NHL players with professional female figure skaters to compete in a pairs figure skating competition.

Roenick also gained pop culture notoriety when Vince Vaughn referenced him in the 1996 film &quot;Swingers&quot;. While Vaughn&#x27;s character plays a hockey video game in the movie, he says to his opponent, &quot;Y&#x27;know, it&#x27;s not so much me as Roenick; he&#x27;s good ...&quot;. IGN would rank Roenick as the fourth-greatest athlete in video game history in 2012. When asked about if he had ever talked to Vaughn about the line in the film, Roenick said, &quot;Yeah, he was actually a big fan of mine because he used to watch the games. He told me he put me in that movie totally out of respect. And everything he does, he tries to involve me with it. In &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;, his fake name was Jeremy in the movie. That was pretty cool. He&#x27;s a big fan of mine and a great dude. Great guy.&quot;

Roenick has made acting appearances on television shows as well, including a cameo appearance on an episode of &quot;Go On&quot; on NBC on September 25, 2012. He has also appeared in an episode of &quot;Leverage&quot;, an episode of &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, two episodes of &quot;Hack&quot; and two episodes of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Arliss&quot;. In 2016, Roenick made a guest appearance in the penultimate season of the Fox crime drama &quot;Bones&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Head in the Abutment&quot;.

==Personal life==
While with the Philadelphia Flyers, Roenick lived in Moorestown, New Jersey.

Roenick and his wife Tracy have two children: daughter Brandi and son Brett. They live in Scottsdale, Arizona. Tracy Roenick is an avid equestrienne rider, owner and trainer who earned a spot on the United States Equestrian Team Long List in 2001.

Roenick is a Republican. In 2016, he voiced his support for presidential candidate Donald Trump in an interview with Philadelphia radio station WIP-FM, though he said he had initially supported Florida senator Marco Rubio&#x27;s campaign.

Roenick&#x27;s nephew, Chris Calnan, was selected 79th overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.

<doc id="440135" wikidata="Q368528" url="?curid=440135" title="Mats Sundin">
<text>Mats Johan Sundin (; born 13 February 1971) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey player who played the majority of his career in the National Hockey League (NHL), retiring in 2009. Originally drafted first overall in 1989, Sundin played his first four seasons in the NHL with the Quebec Nordiques. He was then traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1994, where he played the majority of his career, serving 11 seasons as team captain. At the end of the 2007–08 season, Sundin was the longest-serving non-North American-born captain in NHL history. Sundin last played for the Vancouver Canucks in the 2008–09 season before announcing his retirement on 30 September 2009. He appeared in the Stanley Cup playoffs in 10 of his 18 seasons.

Excluding his rookie season, the shortened lockout season and his half-season with Vancouver, Sundin scored at least 70 points in every season of his career, played at least 70 games in every season and led the Maple Leafs in points in every year he was with the team, with the exception of the 2002–03 season, when Alexander Mogilny surpassed him by seven points. On 14 October 2006, Sundin became the first Swedish player to score 500 goals. He is the Maple Leafs&#x27; franchise all-time leader in goals (420) and points (987). Over his career, Sundin averaged just over a point per game (1,349 points in 1,346 NHL games).

Internationally, Sundin won three gold medals with Sweden at the World Championships and was the team captain for Sweden&#x27;s gold medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.

Sundin was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame on 26 June 2012, in his first year of eligibility. He became the second Swede, following Börje Salming (another long-time Maple Leafs player), to be chosen to the Hall of Fame. Sundin was also inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2013. In 2017 Sundin was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Playing career==
===Quebec Nordiques===
Sundin was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques with the first overall pick in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, becoming the first European-born player drafted first overall in NHL history. At the time, Sundin was playing in the Swedish second-tier Allsvenskan for Nacka HK. He played the following season in Sweden&#x27;s Elitserien for Djurgårdens IF, helping the club to the Le Mat Trophy as league champions.

Sundin made his NHL debut with Quebec during the 1990–91 season, finishing second on the team behind Joe Sakic with 59 points. He scored his first career NHL goal against the Hartford Whalers in his first NHL game on 4 October 1990. After improving to 76 points in his second NHL season, he led the Nordiques with a career-high 114 points in 1992–93, emerging as one of the League&#x27;s premier young players. During this season he recorded a 30-game point streak, tied for 4th longest in league history. He played one more season with the Nordiques, recording 85 points in 84 games, before being dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs at the 1994 Draft.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
The Maple Leafs acquired Sundin in a trade on 28 June 1994. The Nordiques sent Sundin, Garth Butcher, Todd Warriner and a 1994 first-round draft pick (acquired through the 1992 Eric Lindros deal, traded to the Washington Capitals, used to pick Nolan Baumgartner) to Toronto in exchange for Wendel Clark, Sylvain Lefebvre, Landon Wilson and a 1994 first-round draft pick (used to pick Jeff Kealty). However, as a result of the 1994–95 lockout, Sundin&#x27;s Toronto debut was delayed and he returned to Sweden to play again for Djurgårdens IF. When NHL play resumed later that season, Sundin made an immediate impact, leading the Leafs in scoring at a point-per-game pace with 47 points. 

In his third season with the Maple Leafs, Sundin recorded a 41-goal, 94-point season, the second-highest of his career and the most prolific during his tenure in Toronto. With the departure of team captain Doug Gilmour to the New Jersey Devils during the 1996–97 season, Sundin was named Gilmour&#x27;s successor, becoming the 16th Maple Leafs captain and first European captain in team history.

After an 83-point campaign in 1998–99, Sundin led the Maple Leafs into the 1999 Stanley Cup playoffs as the fourth seed in Eastern Conference. Bolstered by the acquisitions of forward Steve Thomas and goaltender Curtis Joseph in the previous off-season, the Leafs made it to the Conference Finals against the seventh-seeded Buffalo Sabres, but were defeated in five games. Sundin finished with a career-playoff-high 16 points in 17 playoff contests. In 2002, Sundin signed a six-year contract extension with Toronto for $52.5 million. Sundin made another appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals with the Maple Leafs again in 2001–02, but lost to the Carolina Hurricanes in six games.

In 2002–03, after eight consecutive years as the Maple Leafs&#x27; leading scorer in the regular season, Sundin was succeeded by Alexander Mogilny, who topped Sundin&#x27;s 72 points with 79. The following season, Mogilny suffered a serious hip injury that required him to miss 12 weeks, allowing Sundin to reclaim his spot as top scorer for the Maple Leafs that season.

During the 2003–04 campaign, however, Sundin was the subject of League controversy with his infamous stick-throwing incident on 8 January 2004, against the Nashville Predators. Breaking his stick on an attempted shot, Sundin threw it aside in disgust. Instead of hitting the glass, the stick inadvertently entered the crowd. Deemed a reckless act by the NHL, Sundin was subsequently assigned a one-game suspension. After the game, as an apology, he gave a brand new autographed stick to the fan that had caught the broken stick.

As a result of the ensuing 2004–05 NHL lockout, Sundin spent the next season inactive, opting not to play in Sweden like many of his countrymen. When NHL play resumed for 2005–06, Sundin was sidelined in the first game of the season when he was struck in the face with a puck, narrowly missing his eye, but breaking his orbital bone. He returned to the lineup after a month to lead the team in scoring with 78 points. However, Toronto did not meet the same success and missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years in 2006. It would also mark the first of Sundin&#x27;s last three years with the Leafs without a post-season appearance.

Near the beginning of the 2006–07 season, Sundin became just the 35th player in NHL history to reach the 500-goal mark. He achieved the milestone on 14 October 2006, with a hat-trick effort against Miikka Kiprusoff of the Calgary Flames. He scored the 500th goal with his third mark of the game, shorthanded, over Kiprusoff&#x27;s blocker in overtime to defeat the Flames 5–4. Later in the season, on 20 March 2007, Sundin reached 900 points as a Maple Leaf with a two-assist effort in a 2–1 win against the New Jersey Devils.

The following season, in 2007–08, Sundin began approaching several team records as a Maple Leaf. In the second game of the season, on 4 October 2007, against the Ottawa Senators, Sundin scored his 389th goal with the club, tying Darryl Sittler&#x27;s team record. In Toronto&#x27;s fifth game of the season, on 11 October, versus the New York Islanders, Sundin scored his 917th point as a Maple Leaf, breaking Sittler&#x27;s franchise all-time record. In the same game, he also scored his 390th goal in the third period, taking sole possession of the all-time goal-scoring lead. At the end of the game, he was ceremoniously elected the first, second and third star of the game. On 27 November, in a game against the Montreal Canadiens, Sundin became the first player to score 400 goals as a Leaf. Several days later, on 1 December, in a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, he broke Babe Dye&#x27;s 83-year-old Toronto record when he extended his home game point streak to 15 games.

With the Leafs falling out of playoff contention once more towards the end of the season and Sundin&#x27;s contract set to expire, Sundin was the focus of numerous trade rumors as the NHL trade deadline approached. Maple Leafs management requested that Sundin waive his no-trade clause in order for the team to acquire potential young talent and/or draft picks to secure the team&#x27;s future. However, one day before the trade deadline he stated that he would not waive his no-trade clause, claiming that he did not believe in being a &quot;rental player&quot; and that if he won the Stanley Cup, he wanted to do it over the course of an entire season. He remained with the club and, with 78 points, marked the fourth consecutive year and 12 of 13 years as the Maple Leafs&#x27; leading scorer.

===Vancouver Canucks===

Sundin became a free agent on 1 July 2008, although the Maple Leafs had previously given the Montreal Canadiens special rights to negotiate with him until then. On the day of free agency, newly appointed Vancouver Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis offered Sundin a lucrative two-year, $20 million contract which, if signed, would have made him the highest paid player in the NHL. Attempting to entice him to sign with the Canucks, numerous Vancouver businesses extended Swedish-centred special offers, such as a Volvo and IKEA products. The New York Rangers, Canadiens and Leafs also made contract offers; however, Sundin chose to hold out for the beginning of the season, contemplating retirement. After announcing that he would, in fact, return to the NHL and sign with a team, he narrowed his prospects down to the Rangers and Canucks. On 18 December 2008 the Canucks announced that Sundin had signed with the club to a one-year, $8.6 million contract. Pro-rated for the remainder of the season, Sundin&#x27;s salary worked out to $5 million. Taking a $1.4 million pay cut from the Canucks&#x27; original yearly offer, Sundin reportedly decreased his contract willingly in order to give the Canucks added salary cap space to potentially bolster their lineup before the end of the season.

Sundin made his Canucks debut on 7 January 2009, in a 4–2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers, and scored his first goal with the club two games later, on 10 January, a powerplay goal in a 4–2 loss to the San Jose Sharks. Sundin returned to Toronto on 21 February 2009 to play his first game against the Maple Leafs. The return to the Air Canada Centre became highly emotional when a video tribute was paid to the Leafs&#x27; franchise leader during a break in the first period followed by a standing ovation. The game was decided by a shootout with Sundin scoring the winning goal against his former team resulting in a 3–2 win for Vancouver. Having established himself as a point-per-game player throughout his career, Sundin was criticized for his regular-season play, managing just 28 points in 41 games while playing mostly on the second line with Pavol Demitra and Ryan Kesler, Sundin returned to point-per-game form in the 2009 playoffs, however, as the Canucks entered the post-season as the Northwest Division champions. He missed the final two games of the Canucks&#x27; first-round sweep against the St. Louis Blues with a suspected hip injury after falling awkwardly behind the net in Game 2, but returned in time for the second round against the Chicago Blackhawks. As the Canucks were eliminated in six games, Sundin finished the playoffs with eight points in eight games.

==Retirement==

On 30 September 2009, Sundin announced his retirement at a press conference in Stockholm.

Sundin was honoured on 29 October 2011, more than two years after his retirement, at a Toronto Maple Leafs home game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. His number 13 jersey was honoured by the organization in a ceremony prior to a home game against the Montreal Canadiens on 11 February 2012.

On 12 November 2012, Sundin was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame alongside Joe Sakic, Adam Oates and Pavel Bure. In November 2013, Sundin was named as an inductee into the IIHF Hall of Fame, alongside Peter Forsberg, Danielle Goyette, Paul Henderson, Teppo Numminen.

On 10 September 2015, it was announced that Mats Sundin would be added to &quot;&quot;Legends Row&quot;,&quot; a statue outside the Air Canada Centre consisting of 12 of the best players in the franchise&#x27;s history.

On 15 October 2016, Sundin&#x27;s number 13 jersey was officially retired by the Toronto Maple Leafs in a ceremony prior to their centenary season home opening game against Boston. A few months later, Sundin was named one of the 100 greatest players in league history by the NHL itself.

==International play==
Sundin represented Sweden at various international competitions, including the World Cup and the Winter Olympics, and held the position of team captain for the national squad for the nearly ten years. Sundin was widely recognized as one of the top players in the world in these international competitions, and added a highly impressive list of accomplishments to his credentials as a result of his outstanding performance in the 2002 Winter Olympics and 2004 World Cup. Sundin won three IIHF World Championships with Sweden in 1991, 1992 and 1998. Sundin finally clinched an Olympic gold medal with Sweden in 2006 in Turin.

A picture of his &quot;fighting face&quot; when Sweden turned a 5–1 deficit into a 6–5 win over Finland during a World Championship game has become iconic. Sundin was the captain of the Swedish national team in the 2006 Winter Olympics, leading them to a gold medal with a 3–2 victory over Finland in the final.

Sundin played for Sweden in:

*1989 European Junior Championships
*1990 European Junior Championships
*1990 World Junior Championships (silver medal)
*1991 Canada Cup
*1991 World Championships (gold medal)
*1992 World Championships (gold medal)
*1994 World Championships (bronze medal)

*1998 Winter Olympics
*2001 World Championships
*2002 Winter Olympics
*2003 World Championships (silver medal)
*2004 World Cup of Hockey
*2006 Winter Olympics (gold medal)

==Personal life==
The City of Toronto is home to an intense hockey media, and since Sundin is a private individual, he was arguably the most scrutinized athlete in the city. He regularly deflected any probes into his personal life, and rarely spoke negatively of his teammates in public. In May 2006, Sundin put his four-bedroom house up for sale for a price of $6.499 million, which led to a flurry of media speculation that he was unhappy with the Leafs and sought to move (and play) somewhere else. However, Sundin and his longtime girlfriend Tina Fagerström had parted ways, and Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment CEO Richard Peddie simply commented that the real estate market was very hot, and that Sundin&#x27;s house was &quot;an awfully big house for a single guy.&quot; Sundin played with the Leafs the following NHL season. On 30 April 2008, Sundin was receiving a leadership award at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic High School in Guelph, Ontario, when he announced that he and his girlfriend Josephine Johansson were engaged to be married. The two had been dating for about a year.

In September 2008, Sundin announced an endorsement deal with PokerStars. He plays under the username &quot;MatsSundin&quot; and will donate any earnings to charity.

On 29 August 2009, Sundin married fiancée Josephine Johansson. The guest list exceeded 200 people and included several current and former teammates. He and Josephine are the parents of daughter Bonnie, and two sons, Nathanael and Julian.

Sundin was also a Goodwill Ambassador for the Adopt-A-Minefield Campaign; an organization that raises awareness and funds to end the human and economic suffering caused by anti-personnel landmines.

Sundin was a partner in a Standardbred harness racing horse named Rotation, which in 2003 won the prestigious Maple Leaf Trot at Mohawk Racetrack.

<doc id="440136" wikidata="Q2716660" url="?curid=440136" title="Emerita (crustacean)">
<text>Emerita is a small genus of decapod crustaceans, known as mole crabs, sand fiddlers, sand fleas or sand crabs. These small animals burrow in the sand in the swash zone and use their antennae for filter feeding.

==Description==
&quot;Emerita&quot; has a barrel-shaped body. It has a tough exoskeleton and can hold its appendages close to the body, allowing it to roll in the tidal currents and waves. It has feathery antennae, which are used to filter plankton and detritus from the swash.

Males are typically smaller than females, and in some species, such as &quot;Emerita rathbunae&quot;, the minute males live attached to the legs of the female. Females are around in carapace length, depending on the species, while males vary from a similar size to females in &quot;E. austroafricana&quot;, down to carapace length in &quot;E. rathbunae&quot; and &quot;E. talpoida&quot;.

==Distribution==
The genus as a whole has a broad distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. Most individual species, however, are restricted to smaller areas, and their ranges rarely overlap. The genus is common on both coasts of the United States and along the Atlantic coast of Africa; the related genus &quot;Hippa&quot; is found across the Indo-Pacific, including Australia.

==Species==
Twelve species are recognised:
The Old World species had been widely thought to form a monophyletic group, as did the New World species. The use of molecular phylogenetics has shown, however, that &quot;E. analoga&quot;, a species living along the Pacific coast of North America, is more closely related to African species than it is to other New World species.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Emerita&quot; was erected by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in his 1777 work &quot;Introductio ad Historiam Naturalem&quot;. The type species is &quot;Cancer emeritus&quot; (now &quot;E. emeritus&quot;), because at one time, it was the only species in the genus. Other genera with the same name have been rejected for nomenclatural purposes; these were published by Laurens Theodorus Gronovius (1764) and Friedrich Christian Meuschen (1778 and 1781).

==Ecology and behaviour==
&quot;Emerita&quot; is adept at burrowing, and is capable of burying itself completely in 1.5 seconds. Unlike mud shrimp, &quot;Emerita&quot; burrows tail-first into the sand, using the pereiopods to scrape the sand from underneath its body. During this action, the carapace is pressed into the sand as anchorage for the digging limbs. The digging requires the sand to be fluidised by wave action, and &quot;Emerita&quot; must bury itself in the correct orientation before the wave has passed to be safe from predators.

As the tide changes, &quot;Emerita&quot; changes its position on the beach; most individuals stay in the zone of breaking waves. This may be detected by the physical characteristics of the sand. As the tide falls, the sand is allowed to settle; when &quot;Emerita&quot; detects this, it uses the temporary liquefaction from a breaking wave to emerge from its burrow, and is carried down the beach by the wave action. Longshore drift may also drag &quot;Emerita&quot; laterally along a beach.

The main predators of &quot;Emerita&quot; are fish; in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the barred surfperch (&quot;Amphistichus argenteus&quot;) is particularly important. Seabirds also eat &quot;Emerita&quot;, but do not appear to target the aggregations of mole crabs. Carcasses of &quot;Emerita&quot; provide an important food source for the closely related scavenger &quot;Blepharipoda&quot;.

==Relationship to humans==
Due to the &quot;Emerita&quot; being the predominant diet of the barred surfperch, surf fishermen use sand crabs as bait. Soft-shelled &quot;Emerita&quot; are kept also as bait by commercial fisheries.

In some cultures, sand crabs are eaten as a popular snack, such as in Thailand. They are often prepared via shallow frying in a pan or deep frying in batter. The taste is often described as falling somewhere between that of shrimp and crab. Eating sand crabs presents a risk of paralytic shellfish poisoning and/or infection with &quot;Profilicollis&quot; parasites. In Malaysia, the sand crab locally known as &quot;yat yat&quot;, &quot;ibu remis&quot;, &quot;kutu laut&quot; or &quot;udang pasir&quot; can be found along the beaches in Kelantan during the monsoon season. The crab is a local delicacy that is usually fried with eggs or roasted on a skewer like satay.

==Life cycle==
&quot;Emerita&quot; has a short lifespan, perhaps no more than two to three years, and can reproduce in its first year of life. The eggs are bright orange, and hatch into larvae, which may live as plankton for more than four months and can be carried long distances by ocean currents. The number of zoeal stages varies between species from six to eleven. Somatic growth and sexual differentiation in Emerita are restricted to discrete events (molts) and both processes compete for energy reserve. In some conditions of high food availability, overlapping reproductive and molting processes would enable females to reach an optimum size and sexual maturity with fewer molts.

<text>Ronald Scott Stevens (born April 1, 1964) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player. As a defenseman, Stevens played 22 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Washington Capitals, St. Louis Blues and New Jersey Devils, serving as captain of the Devils from 1992 to 2004. Although offensively capable, his defensive play and his heavy body checking on opponents were crucial to his success.

Stevens started his career with the Capitals, where he helped the team make the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time. After spending a season with the Blues, he was acquired by the Devils through arbitration. Personifying the team&#x27;s defence-first mentality, he captained the Devils to four Stanley Cup Finals appearances in nine years, winning three of them. In 2000, he won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs. Despite his team success with the Devils, he never won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s best defenceman. His career came to an end after a slapshot hit his head and caused post-concussion syndrome.

Stevens was later inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2007, his first year of eligibility. Stevens retired with the most games played by an NHL defenceman (1,635 games), later passed by Chris Chelios and Zdeno Chara. Stevens was also the youngest player in league history to reach 1,500 games played, playing in his 1,500th game at age 37 years, 346 days. He did not have a negative plus/minus in any of his 22 NHL seasons and had the most penalty minutes of any player enshrined in the Hall of Fame until Chris Chelios was inducted in 2013. In 2017, Stevens was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

==Early life==
Stevens was born in Kitchener, Ontario, to Larry and Mary Stevens, the middle child of three brothers. Larry owned a paper products company and was also a semi-professional Canadian football player. All three Stevens brothers played hockey as children; older brother Geoff would later go on to be a scout for the New Jersey Devils, while Mike, the youngest, enjoyed a brief NHL career with several teams.

As a youth, Stevens played in the 1976 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Kitchener. Growing up near Toronto, he was a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs and idolized Leafs defenceman Börje Salming. Stevens attended Eastwood Collegiate Institute, where he played middle linebacker on the school&#x27;s Canadian football team. One of his teammates was Markus Koch, who would go on to win a Super Bowl with the Washington Redskins of the National Football League. However, hockey was Stevens&#x27; true passion. He and his brothers often played hockey in the house, ruining the furniture repeatedly. He eventually earned a spot on the Kitchener Junior B team and passed on the opportunity to tour Czechoslovakia with the Kitchener midget team to play there. His play impressed scouts and he was taken ninth overall by his hometown Kitchener Rangers in the 1981 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) draft.

The 1981–82 Kitchener Rangers were a team that featured several future NHL players. The defensive corps included Dave Shaw and Al MacInnis, Wendell Young was the team&#x27;s starting goaltender, and the top-scoring line on the team was Jeff Larmer, Brian Bellows and Grant Martin. Stevens and Shaw were an integral part of the Rangers&#x27; defence, playing in every game of the season &quot;en route&quot; to the team&#x27;s Memorial Cup victory. In addition, both played in the OHL All-Star Game. Rangers head coach Joe Crozier said of Stevens, &quot;He&#x27;s come a long way this year ... He&#x27;s strong, tough, handles the puck well and has tremendous hockey sense.&quot; Stevens led all rookie defencemen in scoring and was named the second-best defensive defenceman and second-best body-checker in a poll of OHL coaches.

==Playing career==
===Washington Capitals (1982–1990)===
Stevens was taken fifth overall in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft by the Washington Capitals. Due to injuries to other players during training camp, Stevens made the team at age 18 and never played a game in the minor leagues. He made an immediate impact, scoring on his first shot in his first NHL game. He scored 25 points in his debut season and made the All-Rookie Team. In addition, he led all rookie defencemen in penalty minutes. He finished third in the voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy, which is awarded to the league&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. He was also named the Capitals&#x27; Rookie of the Year. Stevens&#x27; debut with the Capitals coincided with the team&#x27;s first playoff appearance, although they were eliminated in the first round by the New York Islanders.

The following year, he would nearly double his point total from the previous year, finishing with 13 goals and 32 assists for 45 points. Only teammate Larry Murphy had more points among defencemen. His 201 penalty minutes would lead the team; he would ultimately lead the Capitals in the category five times during his tenure with the team, and eventually set the team record for most career penalty minutes by a defenceman. However, Stevens&#x27; success did not translate to the Capitals, who were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by the Islanders. During this period, Stevens learned from veterans Rod Langway and defensive linemate Brian Engblom on the finer points of playing defence. Head coach Bryan Murray also helped calm the fiery young Stevens, who would learn to fight less and play harder. Stevens spoke fondly of his time with the Capitals years later, saying:

The 1984–85 season would be a breakout year for Stevens. He set a team record for defencemen by scoring 16 power play goals, and tied a team record for goals by a defenceman with 21. His performance was good enough to land him a spot in the All-Star Game. Stevens would lead all Capitals defencemen in scoring for the first time, finishing the year with 21 goals and 44 assists, and earned the team&#x27;s Fan Favorite Award. His offensive abilities and size made Murray consider moving him to winger. The Capitals finished second in the Patrick Division, but were out of the playoffs early again, this time courtesy of the Islanders. Before the next season, the Capitals acquired Dwight Schofield in the waiver draft. Schofield was known for his abilities as an enforcer, and his goal was to keep other teams&#x27; hitters away from Stevens and Langway, who were deemed too valuable to lose to penalties. The plan worked, as Stevens finished with 165 penalty minutes, the lowest in his career to that point. He also added 15 goals and 38 assists that season. However, the Capitals continued their playoff woes; after defeating the Islanders in the first round, they lost to the New York Rangers in the division finals.

The 1986–87 season saw Stevens return to his old ways, as he spent a career-high 283 minutes in the penalty box. The total set a Capitals record (since broken) for penalty minutes in a season. Despite missing three games with a broken right index finger, an injury he suffered against the Islanders, Stevens would finish the year third on the team in scoring with 61 points; his 51 assists were also good enough for second on the Capitals. The Caps were once again eliminated by the Islanders in the first round of the playoffs.

During the 1987–88 season, Stevens set Capitals records for most assists and most points by a defenceman in a game, with five assists against the Los Angeles Kings on December 6, 1987. Later that season, he would score at least one assist in eight consecutive games, setting another team record for defencemen. He finished the year second on the team in scoring with 12 goals and 60 assists for 72 points, tops among all Capitals blueliners. He ended up finishing second behind Boston Bruins defenceman Ray Bourque in the voting for the James Norris Memorial Trophy. In addition, he was named as an NHL first team All-Star. Stevens would suffer a shoulder injury in the first round of the playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, a series the Capitals would win. He returned in time for the Capitals&#x27; divisional finals against his future team, the New Jersey Devils. Despite tying a team record by posting four assists in Game 6 of the series, the Capitals fell four games to three.

The Capitals won the Patrick Division in the 1988–89 season, and Stevens&#x27; 68 points (including a team-leading 61 assists) led Caps defencemen. He had 225 penalty minutes; this was the last time Stevens would have over 200 minutes in his career. He was named to his second All-Star game, and added an assist as the Wales Conference lost to the Campbell Conference 9–5. However, the Caps could not translate their regular-season success into the playoffs, as they lost in the first round to the Flyers. The 1989–90 season saw mixed success for Stevens. He struggled, as he was beset with injuries, including a broken foot that caused him to miss nearly two months. In addition, he was suspended for three games for gouging Chicago Blackhawks player Dave Manson in the eye during a fight. Stevens said he never hit Manson&#x27;s eye, but that the eye hit Stevens&#x27; helmet during the fight. Missing a third of the season led to Stevens&#x27; lowest point total since his rookie year; he finished with just 11 goals and 29 assists for 40 points, although it was still second among Capitals defencemen. Despite his lowered stats, the Capitals made their furthest inroads in the playoffs ever. After defeating the Devils in the first round and the Rangers in the second round, the Capitals were in the conference finals for the first time in team history where they were swept by the Bruins.

Over eight seasons with the Capitals, Stevens finished with 98 goals and 429 points in 601 games. He also set team records (all since broken) for penalty minutes (1,630), games played by a defenceman (601), points by a defenceman (429), goals by a defenceman (98), assists by a defenceman (331), playoff games played (67), playoff points (53), playoff assists (44) and playoff goals by a defenceman (9).

===St. Louis Blues (1990–1991)===
After eight seasons in Washington, Stevens felt it was time to move on. The St. Louis Blues courted him and offered a four-year deal worth $5.145 million. Since he was a restricted free agent, Washington had the option to match the offer sheet. However, they declined and consequently received two first-round draft picks plus $100,000 in cash, turning into five first-round picks if the Capitals did not have a top-seven draft pick in the 1991 or 1992 entry drafts, as compensation (two of these picks would become Sergei Gonchar and Brendan Witt).

Stevens&#x27; signing had far-reaching ramifications on player contracts in the NHL. At the time, the deal made him the highest-paid defenceman in the league. In addition, the deal included a $1.4 million signing bonus. Several defencemen considered superior players to Stevens, including Ray Bourque and Chris Chelios, were earning less money, and Capitals defenceman Kevin Hatcher held out until he received a contract similar to Stevens&#x27;. General managers worried that these players would begin demanding bigger contracts. The players did end up asking for more money, and this escalation was one of the factors in the 1994–95 NHL lockout several seasons later.

After he arrived in St. Louis, Stevens was named captain of the Blues. He scored 5 goals and added 44 assists for 49 points, good enough for fifth on a team led by Brett Hull and Adam Oates. He also made the Campbell Conference All-Star team. The Blues were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by the Minnesota North Stars.

===New Jersey Devils (1991–2004)===
Stevens&#x27; time with the Blues would only last one season. In the offseason following the 1990–91 NHL season, the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils, who, like Stevens the year before, was a restricted free agent, entitling the Devils to compensation. As the Blues still owed first-round picks to the Capitals (now five instead of two, as the 1991 pick given up ended up being the 21st pick), other compensation had to be negotiated, and the Blues and Devils could not agree on what the compensation was; the Blues offered goalie Curtis Joseph, forward Rod Brind&#x27;Amour, and two draft picks, but the Devils only wanted Stevens. The case went to arbitration, and arbitrator Edward Houston awarded Stevens to the Devils as compensation on September 3, 1991, with cited news reports the next day first appearing on September 4, 1991.

====1991–1995====
Initially, Stevens refused to report to the Devils for training camp, and would not report until September 26, 1991, 22 days after the arbitration ruling. The Devils were already worried after captain Kirk Muller walked out of camp. Stevens and his wife had made plans to settle in St. Louis, and he wanted to end his career with the Blues. In addition, he was concerned about the apparent lack of unity in the organization, citing Muller&#x27;s walkout as proof. Several Devils players were upset over the feeling that Stevens was being forced upon the team; some players, including Ken Daneyko, wanted more money, while other players wanted general manager Lou Lamoriello to trade Stevens. He would eventually report to the Devils three weeks later.

Stevens finished his first season in New Jersey fifth on the team in scoring, first among defencemen and good enough for a spot on the second All-Star team. He earned a spot on the All-Star roster for the second consecutive season and would miss only one All-Star game for the remainder of his career as a Devil. The Devils would be taken out of the playoffs by their rival, the Rangers, in seven games. In the off-season, Stevens replaced Bruce Driver as team captain, a title he held until his retirement.

Although he would miss part of the following season with a concussion, his 12 goals and 45 assists still led all Devils defencemen in scoring, The Devils were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs again, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games. Stevens stepped up his offensive game in 1993–94. He posted 18 goals and 60 assists, good enough for the team lead and a career-high in points. He won the NHL Plus-Minus Award, finishing with a +53; only Vladimir Konstantinov has led the league with a higher plus/minus rating since Stevens&#x27; win. The Devils made it to the Conference finals against the Rangers, where they fell in double overtime of Game 7. Stevens finished as a runner-up to Ray Bourque for the Norris Trophy; the four-vote difference was the closest in Norris Trophy voting history.

After the 1993–94 season, Stevens was a potential free agent. Officials from the St. Louis Blues discussed a return to the team with him, and persuaded him to sign an offer sheet worth $17 million over four years on July 4, 1994. Five days later, the Devils matched the offer, and thus Stevens remained in New Jersey. However, the Devils later found out Stevens had heard from St. Louis management before the free agency period began, which was illegal under NHL policy. After a five-year investigation, the league fined the Blues $1.5 million and awarded the Devils two of St. Louis&#x27; first-round draft picks. Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello felt the punishment was not enough; he wanted five first-round draft picks plus damages. Despite the investigation, there was no evidence Stevens was aware of any wrongdoing.

After the 1994–95 season was delayed due to an owners&#x27; lockout, the Devils were off to a slow start, winning only 9 of their first 24 games. Despite the reduced schedule, Stevens managed 2 goals and 20 assists, once again leading defencemen in scoring. The Devils finished fifth in the conference, and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they swept the heavily favoured Detroit Red Wings to win the franchise&#x27;s first championship. Stevens&#x27; reputation as a hard hitter was reinforced in Game 2, where he leveled Vyacheslav Kozlov with a body check that temporarily knocked him out of the game. It was later determined that Kozlov suffered a concussion. Stevens then turned to Wings forward and former Washington teammate Dino Ciccarelli, who was upset about the check, and said, &quot;You&#x27;re next!&quot;

====1996–1999====
The Devils expected to defend their Stanley Cup title the following season. However, they became the first team in 26 years to miss the playoffs following a championship. Stevens voiced the team&#x27;s disappointment, saying, &quot;After winning the Cup, you expect to definitely be in the playoffs the next year ... Maybe it was just a wakeup call to get back on track.&quot;

Stevens started the 1996–97 season with a one-game suspension due to high-sticking penalty against Igor Larionov, which drew blood. However, the team returned to a solid style of play and finished the season atop the Atlantic Division, though they would be eliminated in the playoffs once again by the Hudson River rival New York Rangers. Stevens finished second on the team among defencemen in scoring behind Scott Niedermayer.

Stevens&#x27; leadership continued into the next season. He signed a contract extension with the Devils, stating at the time that he wanted to finish his career with the team. Stevens was especially important to the Devils&#x27; defensive corps, as longtime Devil Ken Daneyko was undergoing rehabilitation for alcoholism. However, he suffered a hip pointer injury against the Tampa Bay Lightning and missed several games. Stevens once again had a good defensive season, although his lack of scoring kept him out of consideration for the Norris Trophy. The Devils finished as the top seed in the Eastern Conference but were eliminated in the first round by the Ottawa Senators.

The Devils made several changes before the 1998–99 season, including the hiring of Robbie Ftorek as head coach to replace Jacques Lemaire. The team continued its focus on defence, as the solid corps of Stevens, Daneyko and Niedermayer finished with plus-minuses of +29, +27 and +26 respectively. Unfortunately, the team was once again eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, this time by the Pittsburgh Penguins.

====2000–2004====
The 1999–2000 Devils focused more on offense, which was reinforced by their 251 goals scored, good enough for second in the league. With four players scoring over 50 points, including rookie Scott Gomez&#x27;s team-leading 51 assists, Stevens&#x27; 29 points were only good enough for tenth on the team and third among defencemen, behind Niedermayer and Brian Rafalski. Stevens also set an NHL record after becoming the first player to play in 600 games with two teams. After finishing the season in fourth place in the conference, the Devils swept the Florida Panthers and defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games.

The Devils then met their bitter rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, in the Eastern Conference finals. After getting behind in the series three games to one, the Devils managed to win games five and six, setting the stage for game seven in Philadelphia. During the first period, Flyers star centre Eric Lindros was skating alone through the neutral zone with his head down, when Stevens hit him with a shoulder knocking him unconscious and giving him another concussion. It was only Lindros&#x27; second game since returning from a concussion suffered in March against the Boston Bruins. Stevens had previously taken Flyers centre Daymond Langkow out with a concussion after Game 2.

The Devils completed the comeback against the Flyers with a 2–1 victory and faced off against the defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals. Stevens and Rafalski were tasked with the responsibility of shutting down Dallas&#x27; scoring line of Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Joe Nieuwendyk. Stevens scored the game-winner in the first game of the series &quot;en route&quot; to a 7–3 Devils victory; the goal was his third of the playoffs. The Devils went on to win the Finals in six games after Game 5 went to three overtimes and Game 6 was decided in double overtime. Stevens earned an assist on Jason Arnott&#x27;s Cup-winning goal, and he won the Conn Smythe Trophy for his leadership role on the team.

During the 2000–01 NHL season, led by Patrik Eliáš&#x27; franchise record of 96 points and Alexander Mogilny&#x27;s team-leading 43 goals, the team finished first in the conference. After defeating Carolina, Toronto and Pittsburgh in the playoffs, the Devils once again made the Finals, this time against the Colorado Avalanche. However, despite being up three games to two, the Devils could not finish off the Avalanche and lost the series in seven games. Stevens finished third in the voting for the Norris Trophy.

The next season, Stevens finished with the lowest scoring total in his career, though he did become the youngest player ever to play in 1,500 games. The Devils fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Hurricanes, who went on to lose to Detroit in the Stanley Cup finals.

Stevens and the Devils once again had success in 2002–03, finishing first in the division. In addition, he was named as captain of the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the first time, and finished the season with the fewest penalty minutes over a full season in his career. The Devils played well in the playoffs, eliminating Boston, Tampa Bay and Ottawa to face the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the Finals. Stevens and the Devils had a minor scare in Game 3 of the semi-finals against Tampa Bay when a slapshot from Pavel Kubina hit the side of his head and forced him to leave the game. Although there was uncertainty about whether he would return for Game 4, Stevens returned and did not miss a game throughout the remainder of the playoffs. In Game 2 of the Finals, he set the record for most playoff games by a defenceman, breaking the record by his former coach, Larry Robinson. Stevens added to his list of playoff hits when he blindside hit Mighty Ducks forward Paul Kariya to the head in Game 6. However, Kariya came back shortly thereafter and led the Ducks to a victory, forcing a Game 7. The Devils kept the Ducks scoreless in Game 7, 3–0, to win their third Stanley Cup in nine years. Stevens&#x27; appearance in Game 7 tied Patrick Roy&#x27;s record for appearances in Game 7s with 13. Despite the play of Stevens, Martin Brodeur, Jamie Langenbrunner and Jeff Friesen, the Conn Smythe Trophy went to Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère. Some speculated that there were too many worthy Devils candidates for the trophy, resulting in a split vote among sportswriters.

The 2003–04 NHL season would be the last for Stevens. Before ending the season, he surpassed former teammate Larry Murphy as the NHL&#x27;s all-time leader in games played by a defenceman when he appeared in his 1,616th game in November. He missed several games in January with the flu, and while he was out, he was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome (which would eventually coerce him into retirement). Despite missing the second half of the season, he was still voted in as a starter for the Eastern Conference All-Star team. Scott Niedermayer filled in as captain in Stevens&#x27; absence, but the loss of Stevens (as well as Daneyko, who had retired before the season) was too much of a loss for the Devils&#x27; defence, and they fell to the Flyers in the first round of the playoffs. In the off-season, Stevens recovered and continued to work out and expected to return to the Devils for the 2004–05 NHL season. However, the lockout canceled the entire season and Stevens announced his retirement on September 6, 2005, after 1,635 NHL games, fourth at the time (and now eleventh) all-time in games played, the leader in games played by a defenceman (since passed by Chris Chelios and Zdeno Chára), and 14th all-time in career penalty minutes.

==Coaching career==
===New Jersey Devils===
On July 17, 2012, the Devils announced Stevens would return to the team as an assistant coach. After two seasons of failing to make the playoffs, Stevens stepped down as assistant coach in September 2014. His role as the assistant coach for the defenseman was filled by another former Devil, Tommy Albelin. However, three months later, Stevens returned to the Devils along with former assistant coach Adam Oates, relieving Peter DeBoer of his coaching duties. In a unique move, both Stevens and Oates were named as &quot;interim&quot; co-head coaches, with Stevens focusing on defencemen and Oates on forwards.

===Minnesota Wild===
On June 7, 2016, the Minnesota Wild hired Stevens as an assistant to head coach Bruce Boudreau. Less than a year later, on May 30, 2017, Stevens resigned to &quot;spend more time with his family&quot;.

==International play==
In addition to his NHL career, Stevens represented Canada in several international ice hockey competitions. He attended summer camp with Team Canada before the 1983 World Junior Championships, but because of his commitment to the Capitals, he was unable to join the team. His first experience with the senior team was at the 1983 World Ice Hockey Championships, where he won a bronze medal. The following year he made the Canadian team for the 1984 Canada Cup, but he did not play. During the 1985 World Ice Hockey Championships, he scored a goal and added two assists as Canada finished with a silver medal. He played only two games during the 1987 tournament; Canada finished in fourth place. Two years later, he scored two goals as Canada once again won the silver medal. During the tournament, he suffered a serious cut when Börje Salming&#x27;s skate sliced his face; he would receive 88 stitches for the wound. He finally won international gold with Canada during the 1991 Canada Cup. Five years later, he played in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, the successor to the Canada Cup. Finishing with two assists, Stevens won the silver medal; Canada finished in second place after giving up four goals in the final four minutes of the championship game against the American team.

NHL players were first allowed to participate in the Olympic ice hockey tournament at the 1998 games. Stevens was selected to join Team Canada but finished without a point for the only time in his international career. Canada would finish fourth after losing their semi-final match-up against the Czech Republic in a shootout. Stevens would be part of Canada&#x27;s orientation camp for the 2002 Games, but he would not make the final roster.

==Legacy==

Stevens left a controversial lasting legacy on the NHL. Stevens was the longest reigning captain in Devils history. Later on in his career, he mentored the younger Devils defencemen like Colin White and Brian Rafalski, who was Stevens&#x27; defensive linemate. Long-time teammate Scott Niedermayer said Stevens was &quot;not the most vocal guy around&quot;, but he would talk to players when it was necessary. Stevens was honoured by the Devils by becoming the first player in team history to have his number retired by the team–his number 4 was raised to the rafters on February 3, 2006. Additionally, the Kitchener Rangers have retired number 3 for Stevens.

Stevens was also remembered as one of the hardest hitters in NHL history. He has been accused by some of deliberately attempting to injure opponents, while others counter that his hits were legal for the era in which he played and only appeared malicious due to their ferocity. In any event, he was among the most feared defensemen of his day. Among the victims of Stevens&#x27; body checks were Vyacheslav Kozlov, Eric Lindros, Paul Kariya, Shane Willis and Ron Francis, the last of whom was inducted with Stevens into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2007. One of the more notable cases was young Shane Willis, who endured a concussion and was knocked out for the rest of the series.
Some players have accused Stevens of playing cheap and intentionally trying to physically injure players permanently. After his check on Shane Willis, Carolina Hurricanes goaltender Artūrs Irbe said Stevens was &quot;trying to kill [Willis] or put him out of the playoffs&quot;. Stevens responded:

On the other hand, Willis insisted that the hit was clean, and Kozlov said he was a clean player. He was often credited with changing the momentum of a game not with a goal, but with a hard check, earning him the nickname &quot;Captain Crunch&quot;. He was named the fifth-most fearsome player in NHL history by the &quot;Sporting News&quot; in 2001 and was voted the toughest player in the NHL by the voters. Former NHL defencemen Dion Phaneuf and François Beauchemin are often compared to Stevens, and Phaneuf says he has idolized Stevens&#x27; style of play.

==Personal life==
Stevens met his wife Donna while he was playing junior hockey with Kitchener. The couple have three children; Kaitlin, Ryan, and Kara and reside in the town of Far Hills, New Jersey. He is a fan of the outdoors, and spent his summers away from hockey at Lake Catchacoma. He also enjoys duck hunting in his spare time and is a fan of the Three Stooges. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, he started a program called Scott&#x27;s Tots for the families of the victims. Stevens joined the NHL Network as a commentator in December 2017.

In May 1990, while playing for the Capitals, Stevens was accused of participating in the rape of a 17-year-old girl outside a bar, alongside teammates Dino Ciccarelli, Geoff Courtnall, and Neil Sheehy. A grand jury declined to bring charges against Ciccarelli, Courtnall, and Sheehy, while no charges were attempted to be brought against Stevens.

<text>Scott Niedermayer (born August 31, 1973) is a Canadian former ice hockey defenceman and current special assignment coach of the Anaheim Ducks. He played 18 seasons and over 1,000 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New Jersey Devils and Anaheim Ducks. Niedermayer is a four-time Stanley Cup champion and played in five NHL All-Star Games. He won the James Norris Memorial Trophy in 2003–04 as the NHL&#x27;s top defenceman and the Conn Smythe Trophy in 2007 as the most valuable player of the playoffs. In 2017, Niedermayer was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.

As a junior, Niedermayer was a member of a Kamloops Blazers team that won two Western Hockey League championships and was voted the most valuable player of the 1992 Memorial Cup, leading the Blazers to the Canadian Hockey League championship. The third overall selection at the 1991 NHL Entry Draft by New Jersey, Niedermayer played the majority of his professional career with the Devils before moving to Anaheim in 2005.

Internationally, Niedermayer played with Team Canada on several occasions. He is a member of the Triple Gold Club, having won the Stanley Cup as well as a World Championship (2004) and Olympic gold medals (2002, 2010). Niedermayer also played for the Memorial Cup champions, and championship teams at the 1991 World Junior Championships and the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, making him and Corey Perry the only players in history to have ever won each of the six major North American and international competitions available to players. He was introduced in to the IIHF All-Time Canada Team in 2020.

Regarded as one of the greatest defencemen in NHL history, Niedermayer has earned numerous accolades throughout his career. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2012, into the Hockey Hall of Fame in November 2013, and into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2015. The New Jersey Devils, Anaheim Ducks, and Kamloops Blazers have all retired his uniform number.

== Early life ==
Niedermayer was born in Edmonton, Alberta, but spent the first three years of his life in Cassiar, British Columbia before his family settled in Cranbrook, British Columbia. His father, Bob, was a doctor in Cassiar and then Cranbrook, and his mother Carol was a teacher. He has a younger brother, Rob.

Scott and his brother were inseparable when they were younger and often played hockey together. While their father was often their team doctor, their mother taught them to skate. She enrolled them in figure skating to aid their skills development and taught power skating classes in Cranbrook in exchange for ice time for her sons. An offensive defenceman, Scott led his Cranbrook midget team in scoring with 55 goals and 92 points in 1988–89.

== Playing career ==

=== Junior ===
Niedermayer played three seasons of junior hockey with the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League (WHL) between 1989 and 1992. He recorded 69 points in 64 games in his first season, 1989–90, and helped the Blazers win the President&#x27;s Cup as WHL champions. The Blazers advanced to the 1990 Memorial Cup as the top ranked team in Canada, but disappointed in the tournament by losing all three games. Niedermayer earned several accolades in 1990–91. He scored 26 goals and 82 points in 57 games to earn a place on the Western Conference All-Star team. Additionally, he was named the recipient of the Daryl K. (Doc) Seaman Trophy as the WHL&#x27;s scholastic player of the year and won the Canadian Hockey League Scholastic Player of the Year award.

A top prospect for the 1991 NHL Entry Draft, Niedermayer was selected in the first round, third overall, by the New Jersey Devils. He began the 1991–92 season with New Jersey as the team wanted him to experience the NHL before being returned to Kamloops. After sitting out the Devils first five games, Niedermayer made his NHL debut on October 16, 1991, against the New York Rangers. He appeared in four games with the Devils, recording one assist, before he was sent back to junior. Though he appeared in only 35 games in the 1991–92 WHL season, Niedermayer&#x27;s 39 points were enough to earn him a second berth on the West All-Star team. After losing in the Western Conference Final the previous season, the Blazers rebounded to win their second WHL championship in three years in 1992. Niedermayer tied for third place in playoff scoring with 23 points. At the 1992 Memorial Cup, he scored seven points in five games to lead the Blazers to the national championship. He was voted the recipient of the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player of the Memorial Cup.

=== New Jersey Devils ===
Niedermayer joined the Devils full-time in 1992–93. He scored his first NHL goal on November 8, 1992, against goaltender Brian Hayward in a 6–1 victory over the San Jose Sharks. Overall, Niedermayer appeared in 80 games, scoring 11 goals and 40 points and was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team on defence. Niedermayer improved to 48 points in 1993–94, and added 4 points in 20 playoff games as the Devils reached the Eastern Conference Final against the New York Rangers, a series they lost in seven games. The Devils made another long playoff run in the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, reaching the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history. Niedermayer scored 11 points in 20 playoff games, including a key goal in game two of the Final as the Devils won the Stanley Cup with a four-game sweep of the Detroit Red Wings.

A 33-point season followed for Niedermayer in 1995–96, but the Devils became the first defending champion in 26 years to miss the playoffs. After a 35-point season in 1996–97, Niedermayer&#x27;s best statistical season in New Jersey came in 1997–98 with a 14-goal, 57-point campaign. He played in his first NHL All-Star Game, scoring a goal, and was named to the NHL&#x27;s Second All-Star team at the season&#x27;s end. After finishing second in league scoring amongst defencemen, despite playing in New Jersey&#x27;s stifling defensive system that suppresses offence, Niedermayer demanded a significant raise. He rejected an offer that would have paid him a base salary of $3.25 million and, unable to come to terms before the start of the 1998–99 season, began the year as a holdout. As the dispute dragged into the season, he joined the Utah Grizzlies of the International Hockey League (IHL). After missing the first month of the NHL season, Niedermayer and the Devils finally agreed to a multi-year contract, the terms of which were not released. He appeared in 71 games with the Devils that season, recording 46 points.

Late in the 1999–2000 season, Niedermayer was involved in a violent incident with Peter Worell of the Florida Panthers. After being elbowed by Worell, Niedermayer responded by swinging his stick at his opponent&#x27;s head. Worell suffered a concussion and missed six games, while Niedermayer was suspended for ten games – nine in the regular season, and New Jersey&#x27;s first playoff game. After returning from his ban, Niedermayer&#x27;s steady defensive contributions in the playoffs helped the Devils win their second Stanley Cup by defeating the Dallas Stars in six games in the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals. While celebrating his day with the Cup, Niedermayer took the trophy to Fisher Peak, overlooking his hometown of Cranbrook and was famously pictured hoisting it over his head.
The expiration of his contract following the season resulted in another lengthy dispute with the Devils. While he wanted a contract similar to the $5.3 million per season average the top ten paid defencemen in the league made, the Devils offered a deal with a base salary of $3.5 million. He was again a holdout at the start of the 2000–01 season, and missed nearly two months of play before finally agreeing to a four-year, $16 million contract. Niedermayer recorded 35 points in 57 games and played in his second All-Star Game. Late in game four of New Jersey&#x27;s first round playoff series against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Niedermayer was knocked unconscious by a vicious elbow from Toronto&#x27;s Tie Domi. Niedermayer later claimed that Domi had threatened to retaliate against him over a previous hit earlier in the series. Domi apologized for the incident, calling it a &quot;stupid reaction&quot;, but was suspended for the remainder of the 2001 Stanley Cup playoffs. New Jersey reached the 2001 Stanley Cup Finals, but lost the series to the Colorado Avalanche in seven games.

Niedermayer missed several games early in the 2001–02 season due to back pain, and his 33 points on the season was his lowest in six seasons. Niedermayer and the Devils reached their fourth Stanley Cup Finals in 2002–03. The series was a family affair, as Scott&#x27;s brother Rob was a member of the opposing Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. When asked, their mother admitted she was hoping Rob&#x27;s Mighty Ducks would win as Scott already had two championships to his name. Scott dashed his brother and mother&#x27;s hopes, recording two assists in the deciding seventh game to lead the Devils to a 3–0 victory, and win his third Stanley Cup.

Niedermayer cemented his reputation as an elite NHL defenceman in 2003–04, earning praise from both teammates and opponents for his play throughout the season. Injuries to fellow defencemen Scott Stevens and Brian Rafalski resulted in Niedermayer averaging over 25 minutes of ice time per game, sometimes topping 30, and he temporarily inherited the Devils&#x27; captaincy from Stevens. Offensively, Niedermayer posted his second career 50-point season, finishing with 14 goals and 40 assists. He played in his third All-Star Game and was named a First Team All-Star for the first time. After finishing second in league scoring amongst defencemen, recording a plus-minus rating of +20 and leading the Devils to a modern NHL record low 164 goals against, Niedermayer was voted the winner of the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s top defenceman.

Upon the expiration of his previous contract, Niedermayer was again a restricted free agent, and he again endured a difficult negotiation with the Devils, even after he changed agents. Initially demanding a five-year, $45 million contract, Niedermayer chose to go to arbitration. He was awarded a one-year contract for the 2004–05 season, and the $7 million salary he was given tied John LeClair&#x27;s award in 2000 as the highest ever given in arbitration. However, the contract was wiped out when the entire season was cancelled as a result of the 2004–05 NHL lockout.

=== Anaheim Ducks ===

As an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2005, Niedermayer was in considerable demand; 14 teams contacted his agent on the first day they were allowed to talk to him. The Devils offered him a five-year contract that would have paid him $7.8 million per season, the maximum allowed under the new salary cap, but Niedermayer chose instead to sign a four-year contract worth $6.75 million per season with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He chose to take the shorter term and lower salary to play and try to win a Stanley Cup with his brother. The Ducks immediately named Scott the team&#x27;s captain. In his first season in Anaheim, 2005–06, Niedermayer scored 63 points and was named a First Team All-Star for the second time. In the playoffs, the Ducks reached the Western Conference Final, but were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers.

Joined on Anaheim&#x27;s blueline by Chris Pronger, Niedermayer helped the Ducks set franchise records in 2006–07 for most wins (48) and points (110). Both were named finalists for the Norris Trophy, but lost to Detroit&#x27;s Nicklas Lidström. Individually, Niedermayer played his 1,000th career game, against the Edmonton Oilers on November 28, 2006. He set career highs of 15 goals, 54 assists and 69 points during the regular season and was named a First Team All-Star. He added 11 points in the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs, and was named recipient of the Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player of the post-season after leading Anaheim to the franchise&#x27;s first championship in a five-game series victory over the Ottawa Senators in the final. As team captain, Niedermayer was the first player given the chance to hoist the Stanley Cup. He passed the trophy to his brother; it was Rob&#x27;s first championship victory. Of the moment, Scott stated: &quot;You don&#x27;t really dream of passing it to your brother. I never have. To be able to do that is definitely a highlight of my career.&quot;

Coming off his fourth championship, the 34-year-old Niedermayer contemplated retirement. Remaining undecided on his future as the 2007–08 season began, he failed to report to the team and was suspended by the Ducks as a formality. Pronger replaced him as captain, and Niedermayer remained undecided until early December when he finally chose to return. He appeared in only 48 games that season, scoring 25 points, but played in his fourth All-Star Game.

After the Ducks were eliminated in the first round of the 2008 playoffs, he again contemplated retirement, but quickly made the decision to return for the 2008–09 season. He regained captaincy of the Ducks, and played in his fifth All-Star Game during the season in which he scored 59 points in 82 games. In what proved to be his final season, 2009–10, Niedermayer scored 48 points in 80 games. He announced his retirement as a player on June 22, 2010, but remained with the Ducks organization as a consultant to general manager Bob Murray. He turned to coaching in 2012–13 season, serving as a special assignment coach with the Ducks.

== International play ==
Niedermayer enjoyed a long and successful international career, winning championships at all levels. He made his international debut as a 17-year-old with the Canadian junior team at the 1991 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He appeared in three games as Team Canada used a late goal by John Slaney in the final game of the tournament, against the Soviet Union, to win the gold medal. He returned for the 1992 tournament, one which The Sports Network described as one of the most disappointing in Canadian history, as the team finished sixth in the eight team event.

Four years later, in 1996, Niedermayer first joined the senior team at the inaugural World Cup of Hockey. He had a goal and three assists in eight games, but Canada lost the championship final to the United States. Niedermayer next made his Olympic debut in 2002. He appeared in six games, and helped Canada defeat the United States, 5–2 in the final as the country won its first Olympic gold medal in hockey in 50 years.

Gold medal victories followed in 2004 as Niedermayer scored five points in nine games at the World Championship then added two points in six games at the World Cup of Hockey. In the latter event, Niedermayer scored a goal in the championship game, a 3–2 victory over Finland. He was set to make his second Olympic appearance in 2006, however a knee injury suffered during NHL play that required surgery forced him to withdraw from the tournament.

Niedermayer&#x27;s final international competition came at the 2010 Olympics, four months before his retirement as a player. He was named captain of the team for the tournament that was held in his home province, in Vancouver. He led Canada to the gold medal, culminating in a 3–2 overtime win over the United States.

== Playing style ==

An offensively-minded defenceman, Niedermayer was best known for his skating ability and drew comparison&#x27;s to the game&#x27;s offensive greats from the time he broke into the NHL. He was compared to Paul Coffey for his ability to take the puck from his own goal line and convert a defensive situation into an offensive rush. He often chafed at playing within the Devils&#x27; defence-oriented system, feeling it restricted his offensive creativity, but also admitted that he learned to place greater emphasis on his defence and develop his overall game. Niedermayer earned a reputation for inconsistency early in his career. He often played his best games against top opposition, but his failure to consistently apply his skills against all opposition occasionally frustrated his teammates and left his coaches lamenting that he was a player capable of being dominant but often was not. By the end of his career however, and following his Norris Trophy win in 2004, Niedermayer was regarded as one of the top offensive defencemen of his generation and as one of the game&#x27;s greatest winners. Niedermayer and former Ducks teammate Corey Perry are the only players in hockey history to win every major contemporary North American and International Competitive titles: the Memorial Cup, World Junior championship, Stanley Cup, World Championship, World Cup and Olympic Games.

Niedermayer has been honoured on several occasions. The New Jersey Devils retired his jersey number 27 in 2011, and the Kamloops Blazers retired the number 28 he wore in junior in 2013. He has been inducted into the BC Hockey Hall of Fame and Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame. Niedermayer was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as part of its 2013 class, and was inducted on November 11, 2013.

== Personal life ==
Niedermayer and his wife Lisa have four sons. The family resides in Penticton, British Columbia, but often returns to Cranbrook, where they spent the off-seasons while he was playing. Scott and Lisa are active in the community. They serve as honorary co-chairs of the Walk for Kids, a charity event that supports the Ronald McDonald House of Orange County, while Scott and his brother Rob operate a hockey school in Cranbrook and established a fund that offers grants to community associations. An active environmentalist, Scott has also joined with WWF-Canada to speak out in favour of efforts to maintain British Columbia&#x27;s natural wilderness.

<doc id="440141" wikidata="Q664062" url="?curid=440141" title="The Weavers">
<text>The Weavers were an American folk music quartet based in the Greenwich Village area of New York City originally consisting of Lee Hays, Pete Seeger, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman. Founded in 1948, the group sang traditional folk songs from around the world, as well as blues, gospel music, children&#x27;s songs, labor songs, and American ballads. The group sold millions of records at the height of their popularity, including the first folk song to reach No. 1 on popular music charts, their recording of Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Goodnight, Irene.&quot; 

Despite their popularity, the Weavers were blacklisted during much of the 1950s. During the Red Scare, members of the group were followed by the FBI and denied recording and performance opportunities, with Seeger and Hays called in to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities.

Pete Seeger left the group in 1958. His tenor and banjo part was covered in succession by Erik Darling, Frank Hamilton and finally Bernie Krause until the group disbanded in 1964. Seeger discussed the history of folk music and the impact of The Weavers in an April 1963 interview on Folk Music Worldwide.

==History==
===Formation===
In 1940, Lee Hays and Pete Seeger co-founded the Almanac Singers, which – along with American folk songs and ballads – promoted peace and isolationism in the years preceding World War II, working with the Communist Party-backed American Peace Mobilization (APM). The Almanacs featured many songs opposing entry into the war by the U.S. In June 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the APM changed its name to the American People&#x27;s Mobilization and followed the Party line by altering its focus to supporting U.S. entry into the war. The Almanacs supported the change and produced many pro-war songs urging the U.S. to fight on the side of the Allies. The Almanac Singers disbanded after the U.S. entered the war.

The Weavers were formed in November 1948 by Hays, Seeger, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman. At Hellerman&#x27;s suggestion, the group took its name from a play by Gerhart Hauptmann, &quot;Die Weber&quot; (&quot;The Weavers&quot; 1892), a powerful work depicting the uprising of the Silesian weavers in 1844 which contains the lines, &quot;I&#x27;ll stand it no more, come what may&quot;.

===Early career===
After a period of being unable to find much paid work, they landed a steady and successful engagement at the Village Vanguard jazz club. This led to their discovery by arranger-bandleader Gordon Jenkins and their signing with Decca Records. The group had a big hit in 1950 with Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot;, backed with the 1941 song &quot;Tzena, Tzena, Tzena&quot;, which in turn became a best seller. The recording stayed at number one on the charts for 13 weeks, the first folk song arrangement to achieve such success. &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot; sold one million copies in 1950. (Pete Seeger later wrote that total sales were about two million records.) In keeping with the style of the time, these and other early Weavers&#x27; releases had violins and orchestration added behind the group. For example, on their hit, Lonesome Traveler which Lee Hays wrote, they were backed by Jenkins and his orchestra

Because of the deepening Red Scare of the early 1950s, their manager Pete Cameron advised them not to sing their most explicitly political songs and to avoid performing at &quot;progressive&quot; venues and events. Because of this, some folk song fans criticized them for watering down their beliefs and commercializing their singing style. But the Weavers felt it was worth it to get their songs before the public, and to avoid the explicit type of commitment which had led to the demise of the Almanacs. The new approach proved a success, leading to many bookings and increased demand for the group&#x27;s recordings.

The successful concerts and hit recordings of the Weavers helped introduce to new audiences such folk revival standards as &quot;On Top of Old Smoky&quot; (with guest vocalist Terry Gilkyson), Woody Guthrie&#x27;s 1935 &quot;So Long, It&#x27;s Been Good to Know Yuh&quot;, the B side of Lonesome Traveler, (which reached #4 in 1951), &quot;Follow the Drinking Gourd&quot;, &quot;Kisses Sweeter than Wine&quot;, Tony Saletan&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Michael, Row the Boat Ashore&quot;, &quot;The Wreck of the John B&quot; (a/k/a &quot;Sloop John B&quot;), &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;, &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, &quot;Pay Me My Money Down&quot;, &quot;Darling Corey&quot; and &quot;Wimoweh&quot;. The Weavers encouraged sing-alongs in their concerts, and sometimes Seeger would shout out the lyrics in advance of each line, in lining out style.

Film footage of the Weavers is relatively scarce. The group appeared as a specialty act in a B-movie musical, &quot;Disc Jockey&quot; (1951), and filmed five of their record hits that same year for TV producer Lou Snader: &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot;, &quot;Tzena, Tzena, Tzena&quot;, &quot;So Long&quot;, &quot;Around the World&quot;, and &quot;The Roving Kind&quot;.

===McCarthy era===
During the 1950s Red Scare, Pete Seeger and Lee Hays were identified as Communist Party USA members by FBI informant Harvey Matusow (who later recanted). Both were called to testify to the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1955. Hays asserted his rights under the Fifth Amendment, which allows people not to give evidence against themselves. Seeger also refused to answer, but claimed justification under the First Amendment, the first to do so after the conviction of the Hollywood Ten in 1950. Seeger was found guilty of contempt and placed under restrictions by the court pending appeal, but in 1961 his conviction was overturned on technical grounds. Because Seeger was among those listed in the entertainment industry blacklist publication &quot;Red Channels&quot;, all of the Weavers were placed under FBI surveillance and not allowed to perform on television or radio during the McCarthy era. Despite their enormous popularity, Decca Records terminated the Weavers&#x27; recording contract and deleted their records from its catalog in 1953. Their recordings were denied airplay, which curtailed their income from royalties. Right-wing and anti-Communist groups protested at their performances and harassed promoters. As a result, the group&#x27;s economic viability diminished rapidly and in 1952 it disbanded. After this, Pete Seeger continued his solo career, although as with all of them, he continued to suffer from the effects of blacklisting.

===Reunited and later reconstituted===
In December 1955, the group reunited to play a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall. The concert was a huge success. A recording of some of the concert, &quot;The Weavers at Carnegie Hall&quot;, was issued in 1957 by the independent Vanguard Records, and this led to their signing by that record label. (Additional selections from the 1955 Carnegie Hall concert were included on 1957&#x27;s &quot;The Weavers on Tour.&quot;) By the late 1950s, folk music was surging in popularity and McCarthyism was fading. Yet it was not until the height of the 1960s that Seeger was able to end his blacklisting by appearing on the nationally broadcast CBS-TV variety show &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; in 1967.

After the April 1957 LP release of the Carnegie Hall concert, the Weavers launched a month-long concert tour. That August, the group reassembled for a series of recording sessions for Vanguard. As Seeger&#x27;s college concert bookings grew, the singer felt restricted by his obligations to the group. Vanguard booked the Weavers for a January 15, 1958, session to record a rock-and-roll single. The results were embarrassing and fueled Seeger&#x27;s frustration. The following month Gilbert, Hays, and Hellerman overruled Seeger about recording a cigarette ad for a tobacco company. Seeger, opposed to the dangers of tobacco and discouraged by the group&#x27;s apparent sell-out to commercial interests, decided to resign. After honoring their commitment to record the jingle, he left the group on March 3, 1958.

Seeger recommended Erik Darling of the Tarriers as his replacement. Darling remained with the group until June 1962, leaving to pursue a solo career and eventually forming the folk trio the Rooftop Singers. Frank Hamilton, who replaced Darling, stayed with the group nine months, giving his notice just before the Weavers celebrated the group&#x27;s fifteenth anniversary with two nights of concerts at Carnegie Hall in March 1963. Folksinger Bernie Krause, later a pioneer in bringing the Moog synthesizer to popular music, was the last performer to occupy &quot;the Seeger chair&quot;. The group disbanded in 1964, but Gilbert, Hellerman, and Hays occasionally reunited with Seeger during the next 16 years. In 1980, Lee Hays, ill and using a wheelchair, wistfully approached the original Weavers for one last get-together. Hays&#x27; informal picnic prompted a professional reunion and a triumphant return to Carnegie Hall on November 28, 1980, which was to be the group&#x27;s last full performance. They appeared one final time in June 1981 at the Clearwater Festival, in an informal &quot;rehearsal&quot;.

==Music style==
In a 1968 interview, in response to claims that record companies found the Weavers difficult to classify, Seeger told the &quot;Pop Chronicles&quot; music documentary to &quot;leave that up to the anthropologists, the folklorists. ... For you and me, the important thing is a song, a good song, a true song. ... Call it anything you want.&quot;

A documentary film, &quot;The Weavers: Wasn&#x27;t That a Time!&quot; (1982), was released after the 1981 death of Hays. The film chronicled the history of the group, including the events leading up to their final reunion. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of a possible four in his &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; review and named it one of his top 10 films for 1982.

==After disbanding==
Following the Weavers&#x27; dissolution, Ronnie Gilbert toured America as a soloist, and Fred Hellerman worked as a recording engineer and producer. Gilbert also performed and recorded with Holly Near, and then (in 1985) as &quot;HARP,&quot; featuring Holly Near, Arlo Guthrie, Ronnie Gilbert, and Pete Seeger. 

The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001. In February 2006, the Weavers received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Represented by members Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman, they struck a chord with the crowd as their struggles with political witch hunts during the 1950s were recounted. &quot;If you can exist, and stay the course – not a course of blind obstinacy and faulty conception – but one of decency and good sense, you can outlast your enemies with your honor and integrity intact&quot;, Hellerman said. Some commentators see the reference to &quot;blind obstinacy&quot; as a veiled criticism of those who believed uncritically in all the actions of the Communist Party.

Lee Hays died in 1981, aged 67. His biography, &quot;Lonesome Traveler&quot; by Doris Willens, was published in 1988. Erik Darling died August 3, 2008, aged 74, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, from lymphoma. After a long career in music and activism, Pete Seeger died at the age of 94 on January 27, 2014, in New York City. Ronnie Gilbert died at the age of 88 on June 6, 2015. Last-surviving founding member Fred Hellerman died at the age of 89 on September 1, 2016.

<text>Adrian Mark Aucoin (born July 3, 1973) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. He played over 1,100 games in the National Hockey League (NHL). Aucoin was born in Ottawa, Ontario, but grew up in Gloucester, Ontario.

== Playing career ==
As a youth, Aucoin played in the 1987 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Gloucester.

Aucoin was drafted 117th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft, making his NHL debut in 1994–95, playing one game with Vancouver. With the Canucks, Aucoin established himself as a significant offensive threat, specifically on the power play. However, it was not until his fourth full season with the team that this became evident, as he rose from three goals in 1997–98 to 23 the next season, 18 of which came on the power-play, tying Denis Potvin for the NHL single-season record (broken by Sheldon Souray&#x27;s 19 powerplay goals in 2006–07). In addition to leading all league defencemen in goals and power-play goals in the 1998–99 NHL season, Aucoin also led all defencemen in shorthanded goals (2) and game-winning goals (3).

However, after one-and-a-half seasons, Aucoin&#x27;s offensive production dropped to the point where he had only 3 goals through 47 games in 2000–01. On February 7, 2001, Aucoin (along with a second-round pick for the 2001 NHL Entry Draft) was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning for goaltender Dan Cloutier. He only played 26 regular-season games for the Lightning before being traded in the off-season with Alexander Kharitonov to the New York Islanders in exchange for Mathieu Biron and a second-round pick in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft.

With the Islanders, Aucoin put up the most consistent offensive numbers of his career, including a career-high 33 assists and 44 points in 2003–04, resulting in him being chosen to play in the 2004 NHL All-Star Game for the Eastern Conference. He shared a victory in the hardest shot competition with Sheldon Souray of the Montreal Canadiens with a 102.2 mph blast and scored the first goal of the game in a 6–4 win over the Western Conference.

In 2004–05, he played Modo Hockey in the Swedish Elitserien during the NHL lockout. After NHL play resumed, on August 2, 2005, Aucoin signed a four-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks, eventually being named team captain. However, the first two seasons of his contract were hampered by injuries, and in the off-season prior to the 2007–08 campaign, Aucoin waived his no-trade clause and was sent with a seventh-round draft pick to the Calgary Flames in exchange for defencemen Andrei Zyuzin and Steve Marr. In his first season with Calgary, Aucoin recorded the fifth 30-point season of his career in 2007–08 with 35 points, and recorded his sixth 30-point season in the 2008–09 season with 34 points.

In the summer of 2009, Aucoin, as a free agent, signed a contract with the Phoenix Coyotes. He helped the Coyotes win the Pacific Division in 2012, where they advanced to the Western Conference finals. After three seasons with the Coyotes, Aucoin left as a free agent to sign a one-year contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets on July 1, 2012. During the lockout shortened 2012–13 season, Aucoin served as an alternate captain with the Blue Jackets. In 36 games, he totalled four assists, but added a needed veteran presence at the Blueline. In the summer of 2013, he became an unrestricted free agent. On November 19, 2013, Aucoin announced his retirement from professional hockey. 

==Personal life==
Aucoin&#x27;s son Kyle was drafted in the sixth round, 156th overall, by the Detroit Red Wings in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft.

<text>The British Fourteenth Army was a multi-national force comprising units from Commonwealth countries during the Second World War. As well as British Army units, many of its units were from the Indian Army and there were also significant contributions from the British Army&#x27;s West and East African divisions. It was often referred to as the &quot;Forgotten Army&quot; because its operations in the Burma campaign were overlooked by the contemporary press, and remained more obscure than those of the corresponding formations in Europe for long after the war. For most of the Army&#x27;s existence, it was commanded by Lieutenant-General William Slim.

==History==

===Creation===
Before World War II the British Indian Army had been divided into regional commands supervised by the headquarters in New Delhi, GHQ India. One of the commands was Eastern Command, commanded by Sir Charles Broad. On or about 21 April 1942, Eastern Command was reorganised as Eastern Army. It had both control of operations against the Japanese Army in Burma, and large rear-area responsibilities, stemming from its pre-war task. In July 1942, Broad retired and Lieutenant General Noel Irwin assumed command. The army HQ exchanged its location and role with that of XV corps for the Arakan campaign (1942–1943). After the failure of this offensive, Irwin was replaced by General George Giffard in May 1943.

In late 1943, South East Asia Command was created, with Lord Louis Mountbatten as Commander-in-Chief. Eastern Army was split. A reformed Eastern Command took over the rear areas of Bihar, Odisha and most of Bengal. Eastern Army remained responsible for operations against the Japanese, as part of British 11th Army Group (commanded by Giffard). Lieutenant General William Slim, then commanding XV Corps, was appointed to the command of the Army. At least two sources report the story of Mountbatten&#x27;s first or one of his initial meetings with Slim, who reportedly told Mountbatten &quot;..Let&#x27;s change this ghastly name Eastern Army. Let&#x27;s just get a number.&quot;

Fourteenth Army&#x27;s principal subordinate formations were IV Corps in Assam and XV Corps in Arakan. During the early part of 1944, the Army also had loose operational control over the American and Chinese Northern Combat Area Command, and the Chindits operating behind enemy lines under Major General Orde Wingate.

===Defending British India===

In early 1944, the Allies began tentative advances into Burma. The Japanese responded with all-out offensives, intending to destroy the Allies in their base areas.

The first Japanese move was a subsidiary attack in Arakan where XV Corps was advancing slowly south. After initial Allied setbacks, in which an Indian divisional HQ was overrun, the surrounded units defeated the Japanese at the Battle of the Admin Box. A vital factor was the resupply of cut-off units by aircraft.

The main Japanese offensive was launched on the central front in Assam. While a division advanced to Kohima to isolate IV Corps, the main body attempted to surround and destroy IV Corps at Imphal. Since the Japanese attack in Arakan had already failed, battle-hardened units were flown from Arakan to aid the besieged forces in Assam. Also, XXXIII Corps was moved from southern India, where they had been training for amphibious operations, to relieve the garrison at Kohima and then push on to relieve Imphal.

The result of the battles was a crushing Japanese defeat. The Japanese suffered 85,000 casualties, mainly from sickness and disease after their supplies ran out. The Allies had been continually supplied from the air, in the largest operation of its type to that date.

===Retaking Burma===
In 1945, amphibious operations to recapture Burma had to be cancelled once again because of a shortage of resources. Instead, Fourteenth Army was to mount the main offensive. The Army was now subordinated to the headquarters of Allied Land Forces, South East Asia (ALFSEA), and consisted of IV Corps and XXXIII Corps. Since the Army&#x27;s supply lines by land were long and precarious, air supply was once again to be vital.

The Japanese attempted to forestall the Allied attacks by withdrawing behind the Irrawaddy River. Fourteenth Army was nevertheless able to change its axis of advance. IV Corps, spearheaded by armoured and motorised units, crossed the river downstream of the main Japanese forces and seized the vital logistic and communications centre of Meiktila. As the Japanese attempted to recapture Meiktila, XXXIII Corps captured Mandalay, the former capital which was of major significance to the majority Burman population. The result of the Battles of Meiktila and Mandalay, known as the Battle of Central Burma, was the destruction of most of the Japanese units in Burma, which allowed the subsequent pursuit.

Fourteenth Army now advanced south. While XXXIII Corps advanced down the Irrawaddy River, IV Corps made the main effort along the Sittang River, covering in a month. It was vital to capture Rangoon, the capital and principal port of Burma, to allow the Army to be supplied during the monsoon. In the event, IV Corps was held up north of Rangoon by sacrificial Japanese rearguards, but its advance caused the Japanese to abandon Rangoon, which was occupied after an unopposed amphibious landing (codenamed Operation Dracula) on 2 May.

The Fourteenth Army was supported by the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Service (Burma) who provided a canteen service for the troops of Burma Command and moved down through the country with the Army.

===End of the War===
Shortly after the fall of Rangoon, the Army headquarters was relieved of responsibility for operations in Burma. A new Twelfth Army headquarters was formed from XXXIII Corps HQ and took over IV Corps. Fourteenth Army HQ now moved to Ceylon to plan operations to recapture Malaya and Singapore. It controlled XV Corps and the newly raised Indian XXXIV Corps.

General Slim was promoted to command Allied Land Forces in South East Asia. Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey was appointed to command Fourteenth Army.

A seaborne landing on the west coast of Malaya, codenamed Operation Zipper, was being prepared but was forestalled by the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender. &quot;Zipper&quot; was nevertheless mounted unopposed as the quickest method of introducing troops to Malaya to enforce the surrender of the Japanese there and repatriate Allied prisoners of war.

Fourteenth Army was renamed Malaya Command on 1 November 1945.

==Commonwealth Army==
The Fourteenth Army, like the Eighth Army, was made up from units that came from all corners of the Commonwealth. In 1945 the Fourteenth Army was the largest army in the Commonwealth and one of the largest armies in the world, with about a million men under command. Three African divisions, the 81st and 82nd West African Divisions and 11th (East Africa) Division, were attached to the army. There were many units and formations from the British Army, but the majority of the army was built around the British Indian Army, which was stated to be the largest all-volunteer army in history with 2,500,000 men.

==Order of battle==
The Fourteenth Army was the Second World War&#x27;s largest Commonwealth Army, with nearly a million men by late 1944.

At different periods of the Second World War it was composed of four corps:
* IV Corps
* XV Corps
* XXXIII Corps
* XXXIV Corps

A total of thirteen divisions served with the Fourteenth Army:
* British 2nd Infantry Division
* Indian 5th Infantry Division
* Indian 7th Infantry Division
* 11th (East Africa) Infantry Division
* Indian 17th Infantry Division
* Indian 19th Infantry Division
* Indian 20th Infantry Division
* Indian 23rd Infantry Division
* Indian 25th Infantry Division
* Indian 26th Infantry Division
* British 36th Infantry Division
* 81st (West Africa) Infantry Division
* 82nd (West Africa) Infantry Division

Some smaller fighting formations also served:
*50th Parachute Brigade (India)
*77th Parachute Brigade (India)
*14th Airlanding Brigade
*268 Indian Motor Brigade
*3rd Commando Brigade
*Lushai Brigade
*22 Infantry Brigade (East Africa)
*28 Infantry Brigade (East Africa)
*254th Tank Brigade
*255th Tank Brigade
*50th Tank Brigade

Also serving with the 14th Army were a range of army, corps and divisional units not organic to the combat divisions.

==Legacy==

The War Cemetery in Kohima has the famous inscription &quot;When You Go Home, Tell Them Of Us And Say, For Your Tomorrow, We Gave Our Today&quot;. The Kohima Epitaph is attributed to John Maxwell Edmonds (1875–1958), and is thought to have been inspired by the epitaph of Simonides written by Simonides to honour the Spartans who fell at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.

Boynton was most recently the color analyst for the Arizona Coyotes radio broadcasts.

==Playing career==
Boynton grew up playing minor hockey in his hometown of Nobleton, Ontario, with the NobleKing Knights. He played in the 1992 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Richmond Hill-Vaughan Kings minor ice hockey team. He played bantam AAA with the Kings before signing as a 15-year-old with the Caledon Canadians Jr. A. club of the Metro Junior Hockey League in 1994–95. He was a standout for four seasons with the OHL&#x27;s Ottawa 67&#x27;s, finishing his junior career in 1998–99 with 59 points in 51 games.

Boynton was originally drafted by the Washington Capitals in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. After failing to come to terms on a contract with the Capitals, Boynton was eligible to return to the draft, and he was subsequently selected in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft by the Boston Bruins. Boynton played for the Bruins until 2005–06.

In the 2008-09 season, Boynton regained his scoring touch and posted 21 points in 68 games for the Panthers. During the season on February 27, 2009, Boynton was sent home from a Panthers road trip and missed three games for disciplinary reasons, later revealed to be after an argument with coach Peter DeBoer.

<doc id="440160" wikidata="Q685165" url="?curid=440160" title="Masters of Rome">
<text>Masters of Rome is a series of historical novels by Australian author Colleen McCullough, set in ancient Rome during the last days of the old Roman Republic; it primarily chronicles the lives and careers of Gaius Marius, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Pompey the Great, Gaius Julius Caesar, and the early career of Caesar Augustus. It spans from January 1, 110 BC through to January 16, 27 BC.
==Cast of characters==
Other major historical figures who appear and play prominent parts in the series include Mithridates VI of Pontus, Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, Publius Rutilius Rufus, Quintus Sertorius, Marcus Livius Drusus, Jugurtha of Numidia, Spartacus, Marcus Licinius Crassus, Marcus Tullius Cicero, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, Marcus Porcius Cato, Publius Clodius, Titus Annius Milo, Vercingetorix, Marcus Junius Brutus, Gaius Cassius Longinus, Mark Antony, Cleopatra VII of Egypt, Caesarion and Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Each book in the series features a detailed glossary, hand-drawn illustrations of the major characters, and notes by McCullough detailing her reasoning for portraying certain events in certain ways.
==Historical thesis==
The series has a thesis (first introduced in 1939 by Sir Ronald Syme in his epic historical treatise &quot;The Roman Revolution&quot;): as Rome became more powerful within the Mediterranean world, the old ways of doing things – through the deliberation of various interests, mainly aristocratic and mercantile – became impossibly cumbersome. It became more and more difficult to govern an empire with institutions originally designed to administer a city-state. Certain powerful leaders (especially Marius, Sulla, and Caesar) tried to create a state in which they had autocratic power but also preserved the externals of the old ways. They were opposed by the conservatives (called the optimates by classical historians, though they themselves preferred the title &quot;boni&quot; or &quot;good men&quot;). The result was the birth of an imperial monarchy, and a radically different organization of power. 
==Depiction of Caesar==
McCullough portrays Caesar as an autocrat, great military man, populist, and controversial reformer. She does not portray the death of the Republic as positive, but rather portrays Caesar as a great man and his crossing of the Rubicon as inevitable, given that the alternative was exile, disgrace, and the violation of his dignitas, which was an unthinkable anathema to a Roman Patrician of consular rank. According to McCullough&#x27;s portrayal, Caesar&#x27;s crossing of the Rubicon was his last option, his last roll of the dice, as best illustrated by the timeless quote from Caesar: &quot;The die is cast.&quot; McCullough points out that the translation of the alternative Greek version of his words is &quot;Let the dice fly high,&quot; which characterises not fatalism (as with the former) but rather risk-taking.
==List of novels==
The novels of the series are

#&quot;The First Man in Rome&quot; (1990); spanning the years 110–100 BC
#&quot;The Grass Crown&quot; (1991); spanning the years 97–86 BC
#&quot;Fortune&#x27;s Favourites&quot; (1993); spanning the years 83–69 BC
#&quot;Caesar&#x27;s Women&quot; (1997); spanning the years 67–59 BC
#&quot;Caesar&quot; (1998); spanning the years 54–48 BC
#&quot;The October Horse&quot; (2002); spanning the years 48–41 BC
#&quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (2007); spanning the years 41–27 BC
==Continuation of the series==
McCullough originally decided to end the series with &quot;The October Horse&quot; because in her opinion the ultimate fall of the Roman Republic took place after the Battle of Philippi, with the death of Caesar&#x27;s assassins. However, most historians place the end of the Republic a decade later, after the final showdown between Augustus and Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium, in 31 BC. 

McCullough said that her publisher wanted her to write &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; sequels instead of the Roman books because the latter, while popular, did not sell as well. Bob Carr, former premier of New South Wales, publicly campaigned for McCullough to write further Roman novels. In response to lobbying from fans, McCullough completed one more volume, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, released in September 2007 in the UK and December 2007 in the US. Carr argued that she should not continue in chronological order through the Second Triumvirate and the Julio-Claudian and Flavian dynasties, but instead skip ahead to write about the Five Good Emperors. This was always unlikely, as her eyesight deteriorated due to macular degeneration before her death in early 2015.

<text>The SGI Indigo2 (stylized as &quot;Indigo&quot;) and the SGI Challenge M are Unix workstations which were designed and sold by SGI from 1992 to 1997. 

The Indigo2, codenamed &quot;Fullhouse&quot;, is a desktop workstation. The Challenge M is a server which differs from the Indigo2 only by a slightly differently colored and badged case, and the absence of graphics and sound hardware. Both systems are based on the MIPS processors, with EISA bus and SGI proprietary GIO64 expansion bus via a riser card. 

The Indigo preceded the Indigo2, which is succeeded by the Octane.

==Overview==
Indigo2 desktop workstations have two models: the teal Indigo2 and the purple IMPACT. Both have identical looking cases except color, and sub-model case badging. The CPU types, the amount of RAM, and graphics capabilities, depend on the model or sub-model variation. Power Indigo2 is a version of the teal Indigo2, with the R8000 chipset and strong floating-point arithmetic performance. The later IMPACT Indigo2 workstation model has more computational and visualization power, especially due to the introduction of the R10000 series RISC CPU and IMPACT graphics.

===CPU===
All Indigo2 models use one of four distinct MIPS CPU variants: the 100 to 250 MHz MIPS R4000 and R4400, and the Quantum Effect Devices R4600 (IP22 mainboard); the 75 MHz MIPS R8000 (IP26 mainboard); and the 175 to 195 MHz R10000 (IP28 mainboard), which are featured in the last produced Indigo2 model, the IMPACT10000. Each microprocessor family differs in clock frequency, and in primary and secondary cache capacity.

===RAM===
All Indigo2 motherboards have 12 SIMM slots, for standard 36-bit parity 72-pin fast page mode SIMM memory modules seated in groups of four. Indigo2 can be expanded to a thermal specification maximum of either 384 MB or 512 MB RAM. The design of the memory control logic in R10000 machines support up to 1 GB RAM, but the thermal output of older generation of DRAM chips necessitate the 512 MB limit. With newer, higher-density and smaller scale modules, 768 MB is easily within heat output specifications. Later 128 MB modules allow the full 1 GB with eight out of twelve sockets occupied.

===Storage===
All Indigo2 models can accommodate two 3.5&quot; SCSI disk drives and one 5.25&quot; SCSI CD-ROM drive inside bays on the front of the machine, using specially designed Indigo2 drive sleds with proprietary connectors. All three drive bays are easily accessed when removing the Indigo2 front bezel. The internal SCSI bus speed of the Indigo2 is about 10 MB/s. The typical hard disks are narrow (SCSI-1) 5200rpm and 7200rpm drives. All of the Indigo2 drive sleds have a 50-pin female SCSI-1 connector and standard 4-pin power connector. Advanced U160 and U320 SCSI disk drives can also be used but then one needs appropriate adapters (80/68-pin to 50-pin SCSI).

===Networking===
10Mbit on-board LAN interface, 100Mbit LAN options were made by third parties, either via EISA or GIO64 expansion cards. The two most known and widely used Indigo2 network cards are the 3Com 3C597-TX 100Mbit EISA, and the Phobos G160 GIO64. The second one offers better overall performance due to using the superior GIO64 bus, which also has the effect of reducing the CPU utilization due to DMA transfers.

===Graphics===
The graphics options available for the Indigo2 can be divided in two groups: the pre-IMPACT and the MGRAS IMPACT boards.

Pre-IMPACT options consist of the following options: Indigo2 XL24, Indigo2 XZ, Elan, and Extreme. These options are based on the same Express Graphics architecture from the original SGI Indigo, but feature improved performance. The Indigo2 XZ was launched in August 1993 at and the Indigo2 XL was launched in third quarter 1993 at .

The MGRAS IMPACT (or just IMPACT) family include the Solid IMPACT, High IMPACT, High IMPACT AA, and the Maximum IMPACT. These newer boards have a different architecture than the earlier designs. Physically, they appear to be similar to the older graphics options; the low-end Solid IMPACT board takes up a single GIO-64 slot, the mid-range High IMPACT takes up two GIO-64 slots, and the high end Maximum IMPACT occupies three. The High IMPACT and Solid IMPACT boards provide the same performance for non-textured tasks, while the Maximum IMPACT provides double the performance. The High IMPACT AA option has the geometry performance of a Maximum IMPACT, but is otherwise the same as the High IMPACT including the pixel fill performance.

The IMPACT graphics is the first desktop graphics system from SGI to offer texture mapping acceleration, though only the High IMPACT and Maximum IMPACT had this capability, and comes with 1 MB of texture memory as standard. The Solid IMPACT card is named &quot;Solid&quot; due to its applications for solid (non-textured) modeling. When expanded by adding a TRAM (Texture RAM) module to the board, the amount of texture memory can be increased to 4 MB. Maximum IMPACT graphics require two of these modules due its two pixel units, although this does not upgrade them to 8 MB, with the two modules merely working in parallel to render twice as fast. Of all contemporaries, Maximum IMPACT graphics is the world&#x27;s fastest desktop visualization solution. A Maximum IMPACT with 4 MB of texture memory and the correct graphics settings can play the first three of the &quot;Quake&quot; video game series with acceptable frame rates.

All graphics options for Indigo2 use the standard 13W3 connector for connecting the monitor and another connector for 3D stereoscopic glasses.

It is possible to have a dual-head Indigo2 by merely adding another Solid IMPACT card. Valid configurations include Solid/Solid, Solid/High, Solid/Maximum. Although there are four GIO-64 slots available and the High IMPACT takes up two, it is not possible to have a High/High configuration.

The IMPACT boards draw more power than the GIO-64 bus can deliver, so IMPACT-ready systems have additional power connectors on the expansion riser card, with a separate connection to the power supply. An IMPACT-ready Indigo2 must have an IMPACT-ready riser card, an IMPACT-ready power supply, and a sufficiently recent PROM revision. The Indigo2&#x27;s successor, the SGI Octane, has an upgraded XIO bus and the same graphics options in repackaged form.

<text>The 2004 Nunavut general election was held on February 16, 2004, to elect the 19 members of the 2nd Legislative Assembly of Nunavut.

Premier Paul Okalik asked for the five-year-old territory&#x27;s first parliament to be dissolved on January 16.

The territory operates on a consensus government system with no political parties; the premier is subsequently chosen by and from the MLAs. There were 11,285 registered voters at the time of the election call.

==Issues==

Issues at the election included:

*the size of the civil service;
*the territory&#x27;s Human Rights Act;
*education;
*language and culture.

== Results ==

Elections were held in 18 of the 19 electoral districts. Rankin Inlet North acclaimed its MLA. The following is a list of the districts with their candidates.

Source: Results (CBC News)

In the main, Nunavummiut decided to stay with their present legislature. The premier, four cabinet ministers, and three other MLAs were re-elected; five incumbents were defeated, including former speaker of the house Kevin O&#x27;Brien. Only two women were elected to the 19-seat legislature.

Premier Paul Okalik was given a firm endorsement by the voters in his riding. He faced a strong challenge for the premier&#x27;s job from Tagak Curley, who was acclaimed to his seat. However, Okalik was returned to the premiership on March 5, 2004, by the new legislature. 

== Miscellaneous ==

For the first time, residents of several tiny, isolated communities were able to vote by satellite phone.

Voter turnout was nearly 90%; in 8 of the 18 ridings it was higher than 100% (as high as 134% in Kugluktuk) since there was no door-to-door enumeration and voter registration is permitted at the polling station.

<doc id="440184" wikidata="Q141670" url="?curid=440184" title="Bob Etheridge">
<text>Bobby Ray &quot;Bob&quot; Etheridge (born August 7, 1941) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for from 1997 to 2011.

He previously served as a county commissioner, state representative and state superintendent of public instruction. He is a member of the Democratic Party and was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of North Carolina in 2012.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Bob Etheridge was born on August 7, 1941, in Sampson County, North Carolina, United States to John P. Etheridge and Beatrice Coats Etheridge. He attended the Cleveland School from 1947 to 1959 and was a high school basketball standout. He attended Campbell University on an athletic scholarship and became the first member of his family to earn a diploma when he received a business degree in 1965. He then served in the United States Army from 1965 to 1967. He has also completed graduate work in the field of economics. Etheridge is also a part-time tobacco farmer and hardware store owner.

==Early political career==

Etheridge served as a Harnett County commissioner from 1973 through 1976, chairing the body from 1974 to 1976. He was then elected in 1978 to the North Carolina House of Representatives, and served five terms (1979–1988) and rose to chair the House Appropriations Committee. Having gained a reputation for his strong stances on educational issues, he was elected in 1988 and served two terms (1989–1996) as North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;1996
Ethridge ran for North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district and defeated incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman David Funderburk
53%–46%.

;1998
He won re-election to a second term with 57% of the vote.

;2000
He won re-election to a third term with 58% of the vote.

;2002–2008
During this time period, he never won re-election with less than 65% of the vote.

;2010

Etheridge was challenged by Republican nominee Renee Ellmers and Libertarian nominee Tom Rose. Ellmers defeated Etheridge 49.5%–48.7%. Etheridge contested the result and requested a recount of the vote. On November 19, 2010, the State Board of Elections director Gary Bartlett confirmed Ellmers won by about 1,483 votes (0.8% margin). Later that day, Etheridge conceded the election.

===Tenure===
Etheridge previously served on the Agriculture and Homeland Security committees. He has focused on farm issues, educational matters, and providing a balanced budget.

;Alternative energy
In 2006, Etheridge joined U.S. Congresswoman Stephanie Herseth in proposing increased research and development of biofuels to reduce the United States&#x27; dependence on foreign oil.

;Health care reform
Etheridge voted to pass the Affordable Health Care for America Act in November 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

;&quot;Who are you?&quot; incident
In June 2010, Etheridge was approached by two young men on a Washington, D.C., sidewalk. The pair, who identified themselves as students working on a project, asked Etheridge if he &quot;fully supported the Obama agenda&quot; while videorecording his response. In the video, Etheridge first says &quot;Who are you?&quot; repeatedly, then is seen grabbing one of the young men by the wrists, neck, and back of the shirt, while repeatedly asking the young men who they were. The young men responded that they were &quot;students working on a project&quot;. One of them is heard asking the congressman three times to let go of him while the congressman continued to hold on to him. Etheridge later apologized for the incident in a statement saying &quot;I deeply and profoundly regret my reaction, and I apologize to all involved&quot;. Etheridge called a press conference where he stated that there was no excuse for his actions. He refused to speculate on the motivation of those involved and said that it had been a &quot;long day&quot;. An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; subsequently stated that unnamed &quot;Republican political strategists acknowledge they were behind the episode.&quot;

Political analysts commented on the potential effect of this confrontation on Etheridge&#x27;s chances of re-election against Republican candidate Renee Ellmers. Subsequently, on June 18, a 32-year-old man, Brandon Leslie, said he had been a victim of a similar incident occurring in 1996 in which Etheridge grabbed him when he was a high school student. That report was later disputed by the retired principal who stated that &quot;the student was in the wrong&quot;; however, the principal &quot;did not detail the nature of the exchange between Leslie and Etheridge.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
;111th Congress
*Committee on the Budget
*Committee on Ways and Means
**Subcommittee on Trade
**Subcommittee on Oversight

===Caucus memberships===
*New Democrat Coalition, a moderate, pro-growth organization
*Democratic At-Large Whip (2008–2011)

==Post-congressional career==
On February 1, 2011, Governor Bev Perdue announced her appointment of Etheridge as head of the North Carolina Office of Economic Recovery and Investment, replacing Dempsey Benton, which oversees funds to the state from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

In February 2012, Etheridge announced his candidacy for Governor of North Carolina in the 2012 Democratic gubernatorial primary He lost the Democratic primary to Lt. Gov. Walter H. Dalton. After Dalton lost to Pat McCrory in the general election, Etheridge came within a few votes of being elected chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party in 2013, even though he did not publicly campaign for the post. Later in 2013, he was named the executive director of the North Carolina office of the Farm Service Agency. Etheridge left the position when President Donald Trump took office, as is customary for political appointees. The Trump administration appointed Len McBride to succeed Etheridge in the politically appointed position. Upon, Joe Biden taking office, Etheridge was once again appointed to the position.

==Personal life==
Etheridge and his wife Faye have three children and eight grandchildren. A Presbyterian, he and his wife are active in their church and both teach Sunday School. For his decades-long work for the Boy Scouts of America, Etheridge was awarded the Silver Beaver Award; the highest award a Scout leader can receive. He is a Freemason and has served as Grand Orator.

* (630 m)
* (467 m)
* (452 m)
* (444 m)

==Geography==
The province is largely mountainous, with a long coastline and a number of rivers, notably the Isser, Meraldene and Sebaou. Its western edges have in effect become suburbs of Algiers as the capital has expanded.

==History==

The three towns of Zemmouri El Bahri (&quot;Rusubbicari&quot;), Djinet (&quot;Cissi&quot;), and Dellys (&quot;Rusucurium&quot;), all of Phoenician foundation, were the province&#x27;s principal ancient sites, although smaller Roman towns existed inland, as at Thenia called &quot;&quot;, at Taourga; at none do any significant classical ruins remain. Zemmouri El Bahri (under the name of Marsa-d-Dajaj) and Dellys both attained some significance in the Islamic period, beginning with Hammadid times; the largely Ottoman-era casbah of Dellys remains an attraction. Boumerdès itself, called Rocher-Noir in the colonial period, was expanded substantially following the establishment of the new wilaya in 1984.

==2003 earthquake==

The province was very hard hit by the 2003 Boumerdès earthquake, whose epicentre was near Zemmouri.

Since the occurrence of the El Asnam earthquake on October 10, 1980, this province has not ceased to feel minor earthquakes.

The occurrence of weak tremors was further accentuated in the aftermath of the Chenoua earthquake of October 29, 1989.

From the earthquake of Wednesday May 21, 2003, telluric aftershocks lasted for years before stabilizing at low magnitudes.

Since 2003, the area encompassing this province has been classified as a high seismic risk region to make adequate technical provisions during the construction of houses and buildings.

The technical control of buildings in this province has become more rigorous and strict with regard to construction materials and construction.

The victims of this earthquake, who were housed in chalets and prefabricated houses, were still in 2020 in the process of being relocated to new apartments.

<doc id="440192" wikidata="Q7300200" url="?curid=440192" title="Reach for the Top">
<text>Reach for the Top (also known simply as Reach) is a Canadian trivia based academic quiz competition for high school students. In the past, it has also been a game show nationally broadcast on the CBC. Matches are currently aired online through Reach for the Top&#x27;s official YouTube channel. Teams qualify for national rounds through several stages of non-televised tournaments held at high schools throughout Canada during the year which are known as Schoolreach.

==History==

The televised &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; series was first shown on CBC Television affiliate CBUT in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1961. It was based on the BBC programme &quot;Top of the Form&quot;. In that first year, a team from three high schools in Burnaby, British ColumbiaFred Affleck, Robert French, Lynne Mader and Marilyn defeated every other team and took all the prizes. The first national &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; tournament took place in 1965, and was won by Vincent Massey Collegiate Institute from Etobicoke, Ontario. The series was filmed at locations across Canada with the national championships held in Montreal, Quebec. In 1968, a joint effort by CBC and BBC led to the short-lived &quot;Trans-World Top Team&quot; in which teams from the United Kingdom played teams from Canada.

Alex Trebek hosted the Toronto version for several years, and was succeeded by Jan Tennant in 1973. In Vancouver, the show was hosted by Terry Garner (1961–1982). For many years the Edmonton host was Colin MacLean. In Windsor, the show was hosts were Don Daly and Marty Adler. In London, the show was hosted by Mark Lade, with judge Steve Officer. In Montreal, the show was hosted by Bob Cadman and by Marc Coté. Shelagh Rogers, later a host for CBC Radio, was a contestant on the original broadcasts of the show. Bill Guest (Winnipeg) hosted the National Finals on CBC from 1969 to 1985.

The CBC stopped airing &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; in 1985, but the contest continues to be played under the aegis of Reach for the Top Inc. CFPL-TV, the former CBC affiliate station in London, continued to air local competitions for several years, and hosted the provincial and national competitions. From 2000 to 2008, the national finals were aired by Canadian Learning Television (now ), hosted by Graham Neil of CFRN-TV in Edmonton. In 2009, the national finals were not aired except for the final game, which was filmed in the TVOntario studio. Until 2009, games at the provincial level were broadcast on stations unique to their respective provinces, among them Ontario on TVO with Nicole Stamp of TVOKids (and produced and directed by Sidney M. Cohen), British Columbia with Tamara Stanners on Knowledge, and Alberta with Graham Neil on Access.

In 1985, Reach for the Top Inc., a private company, was established by Sandy Stewart, with agreement from the CBC. Stewart then joined with his wife, Patricia Stewart, in partnership with Robert Jeffrey and Paul Russell of Paulus Productions Inc. to create Schoolreach, an in-school version of &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; available across Canada by subscription. Schoolreach is organized among the different school boards in Canada, and monthly tournaments are played, culminating in a district final each spring. The winner in each district participates in the provincial finals (which are televised in Ontario), and the provincial winner competes in the national championship.

Reach for the Top Inc. produced a season of programming in Toronto in 1986 and 1987. &quot;The Reach for the Top&quot; National Finals were revived in 1988. In 1995, Sandy and Pat Stewart retired from &quot;Reach For The Top&quot;. &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; and Schoolreach were then taken over by Paulus Productions Inc. under the direction of Paul Russell and Robert Jeffrey.

CBC created a similar program, &quot;SmartAsk&quot;, which aired for three seasons before being cancelled in 2004. From 1973 to 1997 the CBC&#x27;s French language network, Radio-Canada, aired a program called &quot;Génies en herbe&quot; (&quot;Budding Geniuses&quot;), which was the French language equivalent of &quot;Reach for the Top&quot;. Competitions continued after the cancellation of the program, and teams from other francophone countries around the world often participated.

For the 1990-91 television season, Hamilton, Ontario&#x27;s CHCH channel 11 broadcast a regional version of &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; hosted by broadcaster Alan Cross. At the time, Cross was a DJ at CFNY radio, but would later be well known as musicologist and host of his own radio show &quot;The Ongoing History of New Music&quot;.

Since 2014, the national finals are uploaded to their official YouTube channel.

==Format==
Reach questions include &quot;snappers&quot; that open and close each round of gameplay, which can be answered by any of the four players on either team. There are also &quot;Who am I?&quot; or &quot;What am I?&quot; questions and &quot;shootout&quot; questions, also open to any player. &quot;Relay&quot; questions are directed at only one of the teams, and &quot;assigned&quot; questions are directed to a single player. Questions are typically worth ten points, but can be worth up to forty points. Points are not deducted for a wrong answer. If a player on one team answers incorrectly, the question is then open for only players of the opposite team to answer.

Each game lasts for three rounds, with one-minute breaks in between. As of 2009–2010, each game consists of 86 questions, plus four sudden-death tiebreakers in the case of a tie game after regulation. Contestants may answer a question before the reading of it is completed. A correct but anticipated guess does not earn extra points.

The tournament is divided into three different levels. At the regional level, local high school teams compete against each other to determine who goes on to the provincial level. The winners of the provincial championships then go on to the National Reach for the Top tournament. The winning team is then declared the national champions.

Some districts also have &quot;Intermediate&quot; level competitions, where the questions are written with a lower level of difficulty to provide experience to new, younger players. Intermediate level champions do not move on to national finals.

==Types of questions==
* &quot;Snappers:&quot; Snappers begin and end every round, and are called &quot;snapstarts&quot; and &quot;snapouts&quot; respectively, and are of miscellaneous category. Four snappers, worth ten points each, begin the first three rounds, and end the first two. To end the third round and the game, there are usually 10-12 snappers worth ten points each. The tiebreaker questions are also snappers.
* &quot;Open Questions:&quot; These types of questions are open to both teams. Open questions are found in sets of two, three or four, and all relate to the same topic. Each correct answer is worth 10 points, and there is no penalty for a wrong answer. Audio and visual questions follow the same rules. Under the rules of the 2007 and 2008 National tournaments, incorrect answers given before questions in this category were finished resulted in a five-point penalty (a &#x27;neg 5&#x27;).
* &quot;Team Questions:&quot; A Team Question is actually a set of questions, worth a possible total of 40 points. When a team question is announced, both teams have an opportunity to answer the first question, called a &quot;scramble&quot;. The team that answers the scramble first will have an opportunity to answer the remaining three questions, whereas the opponent will not. In the event that neither team answers the scramble, the remaining questions are open to both teams. In some leagues, the team question is forfeited completely. This is much like the tossup/bonus format played in quizbowl.
* &quot;Who/What/Where/What Word am I? Questions:&quot; The purpose of a Who/What/Where/What Word am I? question is to guess a person/place/thing/word. Clues are provided by the reader, and are read, one at a time. Between clues, both teams have an opportunity to guess the person/place/thing. If both teams provide incorrect guesses, the next clue will be read. This continues until the fourth and final clue is read. If neither team can provide a correct answer, the answer will be revealed, and no points will be awarded. What Word am I? questions provide up to four quotes with a missing word common to each. If a team provides the correct answer after being provided with one clue, that team will earn 40 points. Each subsequent clue reduces the question&#x27;s value by 10 points. Unlike a good multi-clued pyramidal quizbowl tossup, the clues in a Who/What/Where/What Word am I? question do not necessarily give one unique answer, and sometimes the 40 point clue can be quite vague, e.g. &quot;I am a European Country that has experienced war&quot;.
* &quot;Chain Snappers:&quot; Chain snappers are similar to snappers, but each question is somehow related to the preceding answer. These are usually found in groups of 6, and can replace a snapper set to end a round.
* &quot;Assigned questions:&quot; Assigned questions are found in sets of eight—four questions per team. A question is assigned to each person; if the person cannot answer the question correctly, his/her opponent (sitting directly across from him/her) will have an opportunity to answer. Players may not consult with their teammates when they are assigned a question.
* &quot;Relay questions:&quot; Each team is presented with four questions, one team at a time. The first three questions are worth 10 points each, while the last question is worth 20. If a team provides an incorrect answer at any point in the relay, the remaining questions assigned to that team are forfeited. Consultation is allowed.
* &quot;20-point special:&quot; A correct attempt at a 20-point special will earn 20 points. Some 20-point specials require more than one answer while others are a bit more difficult than the regular 10-point questions.
* &quot;Shootout questions:&quot; Shootouts consist of 12 snappers, and are open to both teams. If a participant provides a correct answer, he/she may not answer any further questions in the shootout. In this way, all four team members must answer a question to complete the shootout. A team will be awarded 40 points if they provide four correct answers before their opponents do. This will end the shootout. If neither team provides four correct responses before the end of the shootout, no points are awarded. Prompting and consultation amongst the players is forbidden. A shootout sometimes replaces a set of snappers to end a round.
* &quot;List questions:&quot; List questions are open to both teams, and are worth a possible 50 points. The reader will introduce the theme of the question, and ask for five items relating to that theme. For example, if the theme were &quot;Chemical elements&quot;, the reader could ask for the first five elements of the periodic table. Teams alternate responses; if one team provides an incorrect response or repeats an answer, then the other team shall have an opportunity to name the remaining items in the list unless they too make a mistake in giving a wrong answer or repeating.

==Eligibility==
Participants must be &quot;continuously enrolled in a secondary school&quot; to be eligible for participation in &quot;Reach for the Top&quot;. The age limit restricts participants to those who are 19 or younger at the beginning of the school year. There are no rules about the language of instruction in a school or that a school must be in Canada, but the vast majority of teams come from anglophone schools in provinces with established leagues.

In theory, Quebec colleges, distinct post-secondary institutions, do not meet eligibility requirements. In practice, because the first year of college is mostly equivalent to Grade 12 in other Canadian provinces, these players have been allowed.

==Select teams==
In 1978, Vincent Massey Collegiate Institute (now separately Michael Power/St. Joseph High School) became the first high school to win the National Championship twice. They played their first game in March 1978 against Richview Collegiate Institute and future Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper in the first game of the Etobicoke, Ontario, flight. Vincent Massey Collegiate easily won by a score of 445–160, with Harper scoring 80 points for Richview Collegiate in his first and only appearance on the show. Nicole Stamp, who was the host of &quot;Reach For The Top&quot;&#x27;s Ontario Championships from 2004 to 2009, is also an alumna of Richview Collegiate.

In 2003, University of Toronto Schools (UTS), based in Toronto, Ontario, became the first school in &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; history to win back-to-back national titles. In 2012, it also became the first school to have won the competition three times. UTS then defended its title in 2013 successfully for a record fourth time. In 2018, UTS extended its record to five by defeating London Central Secondary School in the final.

In 2016, Kennebecasis Valley High School in Quispamsis, New Brunswick, defeated Eric Hamber Secondary in Vancouver, British Columbia and became the second school to win three championships, with earlier victories in 2010 and 2011. Lisgar Collegiate Institute in Ottawa, Ontario, became the third three-time winner in 2017, having previously won in 2015 and 2008.

Schools that have won the championship twice include Cobequid Educational Centre in Truro, Nova Scotia (1981 and 2005), St. George&#x27;s School in Vancouver, British Columbia (1991 and 2004), Saunders Secondary School in London, Ontario (1992 and 1996), Gloucester High School in Ottawa, Ontario (1998 and 2001), London Central Secondary School in London, Ontario (2007 and 2009), and Glebe Collegiate Institute in Ottawa, Ontario (2021 and 2022).

In 1990, the champions from Memorial High School in Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia defeated the National Academic Championship team from Collegiate School of Richmond, Virginia 305–280.

Lorne Jenken High School in Barrhead, Alberta, which won in 1973 and made six other nationals appearances in the 1970s, was considered &quot;the series&#x27; most successful competitors&quot; in the 1985 edition of the Canadian Encyclopedia.

St. George&#x27;s High School in Vancouver, British Columbia, qualified for the national finals every year from 1989 to 2007, except in 1994 when Magee Secondary School represented British Columbia. In 1991 and 2004, St, George&#x27;s were the national champions.

== Criticism ==
Reach for the Top has been criticized by some due to concerns about question writing quality, expensive registration fees, and tournament structure. For example, in &quot;Who am I?&quot; questions, arbitrarily easy clues are often given towards the start of a question, leading to a buzzer race. Additionally, clues in &quot;Team Questions&quot; are occasionally of inconsistent difficulty, providing an advantage to one of the teams.

<text>Joshua Eugene Harris is an American former Evangelical Christian pastor. Harris&#x27; 1997 book &quot;I Kissed Dating Goodbye&quot;, in which he laid out his ideas concerning a Biblically based Christian approach to dating and relationships, helped shape purity culture for many Christian millennials. Harris was lead pastor of Covenant Life Church, the founding church of Sovereign Grace Ministries, in Gaithersburg, Maryland from 2004 until 2015. In 2018, Harris disavowed &quot;I Kissed Dating Goodbye&quot; and discontinued its publication. The following year, Harris announced that he was separating from his wife, had &quot;undergone a massive shift in regard to my faith in Jesus&quot; and had given up on his Christian faith.

==Biography==
Harris is the first of seven children born to Gregg and Sono Harris, pioneers in the Christian homeschooling movement. He is of Japanese descent on his mother&#x27;s side. Harris published &quot;New Attitude&quot;, a magazine aimed at fellow homeschoolers, from 1994 to 1997. He received no formal seminary or theological training until 2015, when he attended Regent College, Vancouver, B.C. Harris married Shannon Hendrickson in 1998. They have had three children. His brothers, twins Alex and Brett, authored &quot;The Rebelution&quot; (rebelution is a neologism defined by its creators as &quot;a teenage rebellion against low expectations&quot;). 

Harris&#x27;s first book, &quot;I Kissed Dating Goodbye&quot;, was published in 1997 and has sold 1.2 million copies worldwide. Subsequent books by Harris include &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot; (2000), in part describing his engagement to his eventual wife, Shannon; &quot;Not Even a Hint: Guarding Your Heart Against Lust&quot;, released in 2003 and renamed &quot;Sex Is Not the Problem (Lust Is)&quot; in 2005; and &quot;Stop Dating the Church!: Fall in Love with the Family of God&quot; (2004). Harris&#x27; book &quot;Dug Down Deep&quot; (2010) shared his journey towards a love for theology and highlighted his passion for what he called &quot;humble orthodoxy&quot;.

In 1997, Harris moved from Oregon to Gaithersburg, Maryland to be a pastoral intern. There, &quot;C. J. Mahaney, a charismatic Calvinist and founding pastor of megachurch Covenant Life Church, took Harris under his wing and groomed him to take over the church.&quot; Harris was lead pastor of Covenant Life Church from 2004 until 2015. Harris assumed the role of senior pastor at Covenant Life Church at the age of 30. In January 2015, he resigned from that role due to a desire to broaden his views and connect to other parts of Christianity. In an interview, Harris said the isolation of Covenant Life, and of a small cluster of churches of which it was a part, may have fed leadership mistakes, including the decision of pastors — himself among them — to handle a child sexual abuse case internally instead of going to police.

Harris started Sovereign Grace Ministries&#x27; &quot;New Attitude&quot; Conference for Christian singles in 1999, with inspiration and guidance from Louie Giglio, founder of Passion Conferences. From 1999 until 2011 he continued frequently to organize and lead this conference, although in 2008 it was renamed &quot;Next.&quot; 

In 2016, Harris stated that he was reconsidering the content of &quot;I Kissed Dating Goodbye&quot; and apologized to people who said that they had been hurt by its teachings. In 2018, Harris disavowed &quot;I Kissed Dating Goodbye&quot; and discontinued its publication. His publishers agreed that &quot;I Kissed Dating Goodbye&quot; and two other follow-up books would not be reprinted once the current stock was depleted. Harris appeared in a documentary film called &quot;I Survived I Kissed Dating Goodbye&quot;, where he spoke to people who were critical of the book.

In July 2019, Harris announced that he and his wife were separating due to &quot;significant changes [that] have taken place in both of us&quot;. The couple divorced that year. Subsequently, Harris revealed that he no longer considered himself a Christian. His former wife also walked away from Christianity and began pursuing a career as a singer-songwriter under the name Shannon Bonne. 

In addition to his previously discontinued books, with Harris&#x27;s announcement of his loss of faith, the documentary film lost its distributor due to the negative reaction from the Christian market.

<text>Scotstoun () is an area of Glasgow, Scotland, west of Glasgow City Centre. It is bounded by Garscadden and Yoker to the west, Victoria Park, Jordanhill and Whiteinch to the east, Jordanhill to the north and the River Clyde (and Braehead beyond) to the south. At the heart of Scotstoun lies Scotstounhill, an enclave of late Victorian and post-war housing centred on Scotstounhill railway station. Scotstoun (along with the Govan shipyard) is home to BAE Systems Surface Ships (formerly Yarrow Shipbuilders), and to the Glasgow Warriors rugby team.

==History==
Scotstoun was until the early 1860s the site of the Oswald family estate, which was centred on Scotstoun House. By 1861 the westward expansion of the Clyde shipbuilding yards had reached Scotstoun with the opening of the Charles Connell and Company shipyard in 1861 and the new Yarrow Shipbuilders yard in 1906. This led to the break-up of the estate, as portions were sold off for housing, to create Victoria Park and for further industrial development (iron, engineering and shipbuilding) along the river, with companies such as the Coventry Ordnance Works and Albion Motors (1903) locating in the area.

The southern part of Scotstoun is characterised by late 19th/ early 20th century tenements adjoining the old shipyards; to the north, and dating from a similar period, is a grid-like estate of mainly terraced cottage style villas with distinctive English styling in wide tree-lined streets, an early example of Ebenezer Howard-type garden suburb town planning.

The west of the area at Scotstounhill has four (formerly six) high rise tower blocks, the Kingsway flats, and a new housing complex of houses and &#x27;mini multis&#x27; built in 2016 by Glasgow Housing Association.

==Current amenities==
Today parts of Scotstoun is a conservation area, part of which lies in the Jordanhill School catchment, and is popular with families seeking fine period houses with gardens close to the heart of the West End. The local primary school and church lie in the north of the area. South of the main road through the area are tenements, a mixture of privately owned and social housing. To the west of the area is a new housing project of houses and flats. Some of the high rise tower blocks were demolished to make way for the new housing project by Glasgow Housing Association. Several tower blocks are still standing behind the new housing complex. There was formerly a fine red sandstone school, Victoria Drive Secondary, which opened in 1909 and was closed and demolished in 1998. Scotstoun&#x27;s finest B listed building, the former Scotstoun West church, was mysteriously destroyed by fire then replaced with a Cala development of flats in the 1990s.

Scotstoun is also the site of Scotstoun Leisure Centre opened in 1994, which houses the Scottish National Badminton Academy, a 25-metre swimming pool used by the City of Glasgow Swimming Team and Scotstoun Stadium - where the Glasgow Warriors play. Rugby at Scotstoun goes back to the beginning of the 1900s, when the likes of Glasgow HSFP and Kelvinside Accies, along with others, played there on their journeys to Old Anniesland and Balgray respectively.

Scotstoun Sports Campus is an international sports venue, hosting both squash and the table tennis events during the 2014 Commonwealth Games as well as synchronised swimming events at the 2018 European Championships, co-hosted with Berlin.

Formerly, Scotstoun Showground had no internal corridor under the stand, which meant you had to go outside down the back of the stand to the showers and back which often provided entertainment for the residents of Danes Drive.

A brand new community centre was opened on Balmoral Street on 18 June 2011, called &quot;The Heart of Scotstoun Community Centre&quot;. A community cafe opened on Dumbarton Road in 2016 called &quot;Cafe Taste&quot; that works closely with the local community and provides ethical employment.

Part of Scotstoun is a designated conservation area and has an active residents association called Scotstoun Conservation Area Residents Association. Scotstoun Community Council is active in the area and represents the whole of Scotstoun (other than a small part of Scotstounhill with G13 postcode). The community council meets on the last Thursday of every month (except July and December) at the Heart of Scotstoun community centre. These meetings are open to the public.

===Scotstoun Primary School===
&quot;Scotstoun Primary School&quot; is a primary school built by the Renfrew Landward School Board in 1905 on Earlbank Avenue. The building differs from those built by the Glasgow School Board in many respects, notably in the inclusion of its distinctive towers. The current head teacher is Emma McGill. Scotstoun Primary is part of the Knightswood New Learning Community.

<doc id="440217" wikidata="Q3844962" url="?curid=440217" title="Monster Manual">
<text>The Monster Manual (MM) is the primary bestiary sourcebook for monsters in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) fantasy role-playing game, first published in 1977 by TSR. The &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was the first hardcover &quot;D&amp;D&quot; book and includes monsters derived from mythology and folklore, as well as creatures created specifically for &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. Creature descriptions include game-specific statistics (such as the monster&#x27;s level or number of hit dice), a brief description of its habits and habitats, and typically an image of the creature. Along with the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;, the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; is one of the three &quot;core rulebooks&quot; in most editions of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game. As such, new editions of the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; have been released for each edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. Due to the level of detail and illustration included in the 1977 release, the book was cited as a pivotal example of a new style of wargame books. Future editions would draw on various sources and act as a compendium of published monsters.

== Early &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; ==
The first &quot;D&amp;D&quot; boxed set did not have a separate &quot;Monster Manual&quot; but provided listings for monsters in &quot;Book 2: Monsters and Treasure&quot;, one of the included booklets. After the series was separated into basic and advanced games, the basic game continued to be published in level-based boxes. Monsters of the appropriate level were included in the rulebooks for the various basic game sets (the &quot;Basic&quot;, &quot;Expert&quot;, &quot;Companion&quot;, &quot;Master&quot;, and &quot;Immortal&quot; sets). These monsters were later collected in the &quot;Rules Cyclopedia&quot;, which replaced higher-level the boxed sets, and the &quot;Creature Catalogue&quot;.

=== Creative origins ===
Games scholar Jaroslav Švelch saw the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; modeled after &quot;medieval bestiaries, only with more precise figures&quot;: &quot;Whereas medieval bestiaries attempted to situate unknown creatures within what was the known system of nature, games like &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; created simulated natures of their own and populated them with creatures that followed their artificial laws and conditions.&quot;

== &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; ==
=== Original &quot;Monster Manual&quot; ===
The first publication bearing the title &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was written by Gary Gygax and published in 1977 as a 108-page book. It was the first hardcover book for any &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game and the first of the core manuals published for the new &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot; version of the game. The &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was a game supplement intended to detail the standard monsters used with &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;. The book compiles over 350 monsters, some new and others revised from older sources such as &quot;Monsters and Treasure&quot;, &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, &quot;Blackmoor&quot;, &quot;Eldritch Wizardry&quot;, &quot;The Strategic Review&quot; and &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine. Each monster was listed in the book alphabetically with a full description and game statistics and many featured an illustration.

The cover of the original printing was illustrated by David C. Sutherland III. A softcover version of the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was printed in the United Kingdom by Games Workshop in 1978. When the book was reprinted in 1985 it featured new cover art by Jeff Easley. The book remained relatively unchanged throughout its fifteen printings up to 1989. Minor changes during the print run included a cover art change to match a new logo and house style, and some minor corrections introduced in the 1978 printings.

The first edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; included topless portrayals of some of its female monsters, such as the succubus, Type V demons, lamia, and sylph. The first edition was also the first appearance of the mimic.

In 1999, a paperback reprint of the first edition was released. The first edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was reproduced as a reprint in 2012.

=== Reception ===
&quot;Monster Manual&quot; was also reviewed by Don Turnbull who felt that &quot;this manual deserves a place on every &quot;D&amp;D&quot; enthusiast&#x27;s bookshelf&quot;, and praised the explanatory text, stating that it &quot;amplifies, where necessary, [the game statistics] and the result is the most comprehensive listing of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; monsters you will find, presented in a clarity which is unfortunately all too rare in other sources.&quot; Turnbull noted some minor printing errors and felt that some of the drawings were not as good as others, but felt that the book&#x27;s quality &quot;is as high as one can reasonably expect in such a complex matter&quot;. Turnbull concluded by saying &quot;I can do no more than heap high praise on the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;. If every DM and every player didn&#x27;t buy it, I would be very surprised. It is without doubt the best thing that TSR have produced so far.&quot; Lawrence Schick, author of &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;, commented that &quot;As nothing is easier to design than new monsters, it has spawned a host of imitations.&quot; Games journalist David M. Ewalt commented that the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons &quot;Monster Manual&quot; may have been a rush job, but its quality is undeniable.[...] The &quot;Monster Manual&quot; succeeded not just as a game supplement but by elevating the D&amp;D rule book to fetish object. [...] The book became a beloved companion to a generation of gamers, something they came back to again and again.&quot;

Scott Taylor of &quot;Black Gate&quot; listed the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; as #8 on the list of &quot;Top 10 &#x27;Orange Spine&#x27; &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; Hardcovers By Jeff Easley, saying &quot;Classic! Red Dragon fighting Pegasi in an air duel? What isn&#x27;t to love about this one?&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath called the amount and professionalism of the interior illustrations groundbreaking, saying &quot;Sutherland is joined primarily by David Trampier, whose clean, precise lines often evoke the feel of medieval woodcuts. Together, they create a world where green slime drips from the ceiling and treasure chests can come to (hungry) life. RPGs take place in the theater of the mind, but the importance of finally seeing these creatures, often in tableau with unfortunate adventurers meeting their dooms, can&#x27;t be overstated ... &quot;Monster Manual&quot; set the mold for other to follow [and] all embrace a standard of art and detail created here by Gygax and his collaborators.&quot; Witwer &quot;et al.&quot; commented in their overview of the artwork of the game: &quot;Collectively, the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; images became the canonical representations of these fantastic creatures for an entire generation, a modern bestiary that has served as an authoritative resource for countless subsequent fantasy games.&quot;
=== &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; ===
&quot;Fiend Folio&quot; was published by TSR, Inc. &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; was primarily made up of monsters described in the &quot;Fiend Factory&quot; feature of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; and from various &quot;D&amp;D&quot; modules, while some were original creations. It introduced several popular monsters to the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game including drow, githyanki, githzerai, slaad, and death knights. It also featured monsters that were widely ridiculed, such as the flumph, one of the few non-evil creatures presented in the volume.

=== &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; ===
&quot;Monster Manual II&quot; was a 160-page hardcover book published in 1983, also credited solely to Gygax. The book was a supplement that detailed more than 250 monsters, most of them featuring illustrations. Many monsters in the book were taken from previously published adventure modules. The book contained random encounter tables for dungeon and wilderness settings built from the monsters in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, &quot;Fiend Folio&quot;, and &quot;Monster Manual II&quot;. Some of its contents were taken from various &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; adventure modules, in particular quite a number from &quot;S4: Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth&quot;, and a dozen new devils that had been first published in the pages of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine. Like the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; before it, the monsters in &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; listed the experience point value for each monster within the entry. The &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; along with the First Edition &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; book featured quite a number of monsters, races, and places from Gary Gygax&#x27;s home Greyhawk campaign world.

== &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition&quot; ==
The &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot; superseded the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; with the release of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd edition. The &quot;Compendium&quot; was a binder of looseleaf sheets, rather than a hardback book. The first two volumes contained the core monsters of the game. These were followed by many appendices that contained extra monsters for particular campaign settings.

The format was intended to help Dungeon Masters (DM) keep handy only the monster statistics needed for a particular game session, as well as to greatly expand the information about each monster, as each was given at least one full page. It would also mean they would only need to purchase core volumes and appendix volumes for the campaigns they wanted, rather than getting a mix of monsters in books. However, the binder format ultimately proved impractical for two main reasons. First, looseleaf pages were not as durable as the hardcover format. As it was a frequently used game aid this was a serious concern. Second, TSR routinely printed different monsters on each side of a sheet, making it impossible to keep monsters in strict alphabetical order.

In 1993, the &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; was released, compiling all monsters from the first two volumes of the &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot; plus many monsters from other sources into a 384-page hardcover book edited by Doug Stewart. More &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot; appendices were released as a supplements to the &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; in the form of paperback books. They included updated reprints of loose leaf &quot;Monstrous Compendium Appendices&quot; and new volumes.

== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition ==
The &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for the third edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; was released on October 1, 2000 as the third of three core books of the system. Monte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams all contributed to the third edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot;. Williams is credited with the design of the book. The updates were not intended to make major changes, only to update older monsters to third edition rules. According to Williams, &quot;the first item on the agenda was combing through the game&#x27;s twenty year collection of monsters, and deciding which ones were going into the book... The design team decided to focus on creatures that fit well into classic dungeon style adventures, with extra emphasis on creatures we felt the game needed.&quot; In 2001 &quot;Monster Manual&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Graphic Design of a Roleplaying Game, Adventure, or Supplement 2000&quot;. One reviewer for &quot;Pyramid&quot; called it &quot;...an essential reference book, and it is a bargain...&quot;

The next volumes, &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; and &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; were new monster-specific rulebooks. They contain mostly updated monsters from the sourcebooks of earlier editions, though some monsters have almost no overlap with those of their first edition namesakes. There were no new versions of &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; or &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; for the 3.5 edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, although update errata for both volumes and for the original third edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; are available for download from the publisher&#x27;s website.
===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; version 3.5===

In July 2003, the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was revised and released again for &quot;D&amp;D&quot; v 3.5. The revision was done by Rich Baker and Skip Williams. The 3.5 revision has a slightly different entry on each monster than 3rd edition. Notably, each monster&#x27;s attack has been divided into &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;full attack&quot; entries. When asked about the hardest part in revising the book, Rich Baker replied: &quot;The hardest part of the job was probably the sheer volume of the work we needed to do. There are hundreds of monster entries, and each monster has a couple dozen data points to examine and check.&quot; Some creatures from the &quot;Psionics Handbook&quot; and the third edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; were added to the revised book. Further revision included the addition of an enhanced version of most monsters as an example of advancement (usually either with a template or with class levels). Many monsters also included instructions on how to use them as player characters.

The &quot;Monster Manual&quot; v 3.5 was reproduced as a premium reprint on September 18, 2012.
==== &quot;Monster Manual III&quot; ====
&quot;Monster Manual III&quot; was published in September 2004, and was designed by Rich Burlew, Eric Cagle, Jesse Decker, Andrew J. Finch, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, Rich Redman, Matthew Sernett, Chris Thomasson, and P. Nathan Toomey. This Monster Manual is notable for its descriptions of where the monsters might be found in the Eberron and Forgotten Realms campaign settings. Chris Perkins explained: &quot;Almost all of the monsters in the &quot;Monster Manual III&quot; are new. We didn&#x27;t want to give gamers a bunch of beasties they&#x27;d already seen, and we found several interesting monster niches to fill.

====&quot;Monster Manual IV&quot;====
&quot;Monster Manual IV&quot;, published July 2006, was designed by Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, Jennifer Clarke Wilkes, Matthew Sernett, Eric Cagle, Andrew Finch, Christopher Lindsay, Kolja Raven Liquette, Chris Sims, Owen K.C. Stephens, Travis Stout, JD Wiker, and Skip Williams. This book was also published in the v3.5 format and used the new stat block format that was introduced in the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide II&quot;. &quot;Monster Manual IV&quot; contained fewer actual monsters than &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; and &quot;Monster Manual III&quot;, but had sample lairs and encounters for them, gave stats for classes and templates applied to old creatures, and full page maps. The book also ties into the &quot;Year of the Dragons&quot; theme that Wizards of the Coast planned out for 2006 with the &quot;Spawn of Tiamat&quot;, yet contains no new monsters that are considered true dragons.

====&quot;Special Edition Monster Manual&quot;====
In October 2006, the &quot;Special Edition Monster Manual&quot; was released, completing the set of special edition core rulebooks started in 2004 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. Like the others, this book was leather-bound with silver-gilt edges and a cloth bookmark. The book was expanded with some new information, 31 new illustrations, and a new index. All collected errata up to its release date were included in this revision.

====&quot;Monster Manual V&quot;====
&quot;Monster Manual V&quot; was released in July 2007, with David Noonan as lead designer, and additional design by Creighton Broadhurst, Jason Bulmahn, David Chart, B. Matthew Conklin III, Jesse Decker, James &quot;Grim&quot; Desborough, Rob Heinsoo, Sterling Hershey, Tim Hitchcock, Luke Johnson, Nicholas Logue, Mike McArtor, Aaron Rosenberg, Robert J. Schwalb, Rodney Thompson, and Wil Upchurch. This book was published in the same format as the &quot;Monster Manual IV&quot;, featuring lairs and tactics and, like III and IV, detailing how these new monsters fit into Eberron and Forgotten Realms.

== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition ==
The &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 4th edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was released with the other core books on June 6, 2008. It featured the demon prince Orcus on the cover. The book was designed by Mike Mearls, Stephen Schubert, and James Wyatt.

&quot;Monster Manual 2&quot; was released on May 20, 2009 with Demogorgon on the cover; &quot;Monster Manual 3&quot; was released on June 15, 2010 featuring Lolth on its cover.

&quot;Monster Vault&quot; was released November 16, 2010 and featured monsters introduced in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; revised to the new format that was introduced in &quot;Monster Manual 3&quot;. &quot;Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale&quot; was released June 28, 2011 and re-introduced a few new monsters as well as several related to the setting of Nentir Vale. All volumes of the &quot;Monster Vault&quot; are parts of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Essentials&quot; line of 4th edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; products.
== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition ==
On September 30, 2014, the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 5th edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was the second core book released for the new edition. On the staggered release schedule, Jeremy Crawford wrote &quot;our small team couldn’t finish the books at the same time and also ensure their high quality. [...] We could either stagger their releases, or we could sit on the books until all three were finished&quot;. The book is 350 pages and illustrated. Crawford and Mike Mearls co-lead design for the Fifth Edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The cover depicts the beholder Xanathar attacking adventurers in the Underdark.

=== Reception ===
In &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;″s &quot;Best-selling Books Week Ending October 13, 2014&quot;, &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was #5 in &quot;Hardcover Nonfiction&quot; and sold 16,956 units.

In a review of &quot;Monster Manual&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Scott Taylor said &quot;In all, this is a very sharp book in the gaming &#x27;Big Three&#x27; (&quot;Players Handbook&quot;, &quot;DMG&quot;, and &quot;MM&quot;), and anyone looking to take on the challenge of 5E will be happy with what they&#x27;ve invested in.&quot;

The 5th edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; won the 2015 Origins Award for Best Role Playing Supplement and Fan Favorite Role Playing Supplement. The book won two 2015 gold ENnie Awards: &quot;Best Monster/Adversary&quot; and &quot;Best Interior Art&quot;.

<doc id="440218" wikidata="Q9391030" url="?curid=440218" title="Pentecostal Church of God">
<text>The Pentecostal Church of God (PCG) is a Finished Work Pentecostal denomination of Christianity headquartered in Bedford, Texas, United States. As of 2010, there were 620,000 members, 6,750 clergy in 4,825 churches worldwide.

The PCG is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals, the Pentecostal World Conference and the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America. The church&#x27;s official publication is &quot;The Pentecostal Messenger&quot;.

==History==

First called the Pentecostal Assemblies of USA, the PCG was formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1919 by a group of Pentecostal ministers who had chosen not to affiliate with the Assemblies of God and several who had left that organization after it adopted a doctrinal statement in 1916. John C. Sinclair, an early Pentecostal pastor in Chicago, and a former Assemblies of God presbyter served as the first moderator. The Pentecostal Assemblies of the USA was dissolved in 1922, and the organization resumed under the name Pentecostal Church of God.

In 1927, the denominational headquarters relocated to Ottumwa, Iowa; in 1933, to Kansas City, Missouri; in 1951, to Joplin, Missouri in 1951; and in 2012, to Bedford, Texas.

Although the relocation to Bedford, TX followed the 2011 Joplin Tornado, the decision to move had started at least three years earlier when the 2009 General Convention voted to explore relocating to a larger metropolitan area. The reason for the move was because of lower income due to declining minister and church membership and Messenger College could no longer support itself.

==Beliefs==
The Pentecostal Church of God combines Pentecostal and evangelical doctrines in its Statement of Faith. 

*Both the Old and New Testament of the Bible is the inspired word of God. 
*Believes there is one God that exists as a Trinity. 
*Salvation is available through Jesus Christ&#x27;s sacrifice on the cross. 
*Salvation can be lost if one turns away from God by a human&#x27;s free will. 
*Believes in water baptism according to the Trinitarian formula. 
*After salvation, a Christian can be baptized with the Holy Spirit, which is evidenced by speaking in tongues. 
*Sanctification occurs progressively, that begins at the time of regeneration. 
*Heaven and hell are literal places; heaven being for those who have received salvation, and hell for those who have rejected it. 
*The Christian Church is made of all true Christians. 
*There are two ordinances: water baptism and the Lord&#x27;s supper. Water baptism symbolizes identification with Christ&#x27;s death, burial, and resurrection. The Lord&#x27;s supper is done in remembrance of Christ&#x27;s death. 
*Members practice tithing. 
*Believes that Jesus Christ will return and that his return is imminent. His coming will be personal, pretribulation, premillennial.

==Organization==
The church is led by a General Bishop (formerly called General Superintendent and before that General Moderator and General Chairman) and a General Convention which meets biennially. It is divided into a number of districts, including four Hispanic districts in the United States. Each district is served by a district bishop, previously district superintendent. District conventions meet annually. In 2002, the General Convention came to a consensus to change the title of their overseer from General Superintendent to Bishop. The change was made because internationally, the term &quot;bishop&quot; is more commonly related to religious leaders than the previous title. Prior to 2011, the International headquarters were located in Joplin, Missouri where a college and a publishing house operated. In 2012 The International Headquarters moved to Bedford, TX and the College, Messenger College, followed and is located in Euless, Texas. As of 2017, the International Headquarters has changed its name to the IMC, International Missions Center. The Messenger College learning center was relocated to the fourth floor of the International Missions Center, classes beginning in the new location at the start of the 2018-19 academic school year.

<text>The Blue Stingrays were a late 1990s rock band that played surf rock, incorporating some country and western elements, with an overall Hawaiian atmosphere.

The band was composed of the members of The Heartbreakers, Tom Petty&#x27;s band. During a short break from their work with Petty they recorded one album, &quot;Surf-n-Burn&quot;, which included a cover of the theme song &quot;Goldfinger&quot; from the James Bond film of the same name. Released by Epitone Records, the album&#x27;s liner notes include a faux history of The Blue Stingrays as if they were a legendary instrumental band founded in the late 1950s whose original albums were lost for decades due to the band members desire for anonymity. It was a reunion of sorts, with founding bassist Ron Blair playing with Heartbreakers members for the first time in 15 years, and Randall Marsh drumming, who was in a previous incarnation of the Heartbreakers called Mudcrutch.

<doc id="440234" wikidata="Q928092" url="?curid=440234" title="Peter the Iberian">
<text>Peter the Iberian () (c. 417-491) was a Georgian royal prince, theologian and philosopher who was a prominent figure in early Christianity and one of the founders of Christian Neoplatonism. Some have claimed that he is the author known conventionally as Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.

His accomplishments include founding the first Georgian monastery in Bethlehem and becoming the bishop of Maiuma near Gaza. The oldest Georgian &quot;Bir el Qutt inscriptions&quot; mention Peter with his father.

==Life==
===Early life in Constantinople and Jerusalem===
Peter was born into the royal Chosroid dynasty of the Kings of Iberia (Eastern Georgia) and was initially named Murvan (alternatively, Nabarnugios), Prince of Iberia (Kartli). His father, King Bosmarios of Iberia, invited noted philosopher Mithradates from Lazica (also called John the Eunuch) to take part in Murvan&#x27;s education. For a time, the child was kept hidden so as not to be delivered as a hostage to the Persians.

In 423, at the age of about five, the prince was sent as a political hostage to Constantinople to ensure the loyalty of Iberia to the Byzantines rather than to the Persians. Here he received a brilliant education under a personal patronage of the Roman empress Aelia Eudocia, wife of Theodosius II. When he was about twenty, the young prince, together with his mentor Mithradates, left the palace and made a pilgrimage to Palestine. It remains uncertain whether they had planned to return to Constantinople or if this was an escape, nevertheless their presence in Jerusalem was commonly known and they were not forced to return. 

In Jerusalem, they were received by Melania the Younger, a famous ascetic whom Peter had met earlier in Constantinople and who might have inspired him to follow her. Melania bestowed upon them the monastic garb in a ceremony in the Anastasis and they became monks at her monastery on the Mount of Olives under their new names Peter and John. Peter brought with him also relics of Persian martyrs, which were interred in a martyrion build by Melania on the mountain with patriarch Cyril of Alexandria conducting the ceremony, as well money which they used to build their own monastery (later called the monastery of the Iberians) and which they converted into a hostel for pilgrims after some time. 

===Life in Gaza===

It was the monk Zeno, called the Prophet, who recalled them to their monastic life and upon whose advice they departed to a monastery between Gaza and Maiuma. There, Zeno became Peter&#x27;s spiritual guide and Peter became acquainted with the monastic circles in the region. According to his biographer, John Rufus, Peter refused to write to or receive letters from home lest it undermine his ascetic discipline. At some point around 445, the bishop of Maiuma ordained Peter though Peter attempted to avoid serving as a priest in favour of monastic life.

In 452, he was consecrated bishop of Maiuma by Patriarch Theodosius. He only served for six months before some Christians were banished by the decree of the local ruler. Peter escaped to Egypt, where he found refuge in the Enaton.

In the early 470s, Peter moved to Peleia near Ascalon where he continued ascetic activities, visiting various towns and villages of Palestine. Here he acquired great fame as a holy Father. He was called &quot;pillar of Orthodoxy&quot;, &quot;Great Peter&quot;, &quot;the second Apostle Paul&quot;, &quot;the second Moses&quot; and &quot;an exceedingly wonderful person&quot;. He gained numerous followers and disciples. According to the medieval sources, he was an author of several famous religious works. However, none of them survived to be written under the name of Peter. For three years he lived at the hermitage of Hilarion, then for some time in a shack on the seashore near Azotus before moving on an estate at Yavneh-Yam, the port of ancient Iamnia, formerly belonging to Eudocia and now managed by a follower of his. He died there in 491 and was buried in his monastery near Gaza.

==Position vs. Chalcedonian creed==
Various eastern Churches think that he may have deviated from the Chalcedonian doctrine. These Churches (Armenian, Coptic, etc) believe that Peter the Iberian was a Miaphysite and an anti-Chalcedonian, whereas this view is not shared by the Georgian Orthodox Church. Although his biographies do not discuss this issue, some of the scholars who side with the Armenian sources accept the idea that he was an anti-Chaldeonian, while others do not. For example, David Marshall Lang believes in the possibility that he was a Miaphysite, while Shalva Nutsubidze and Ernest Honingmann believe that he was a Neoplatonic philosopher.

==Biographies==
Peter&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot; was written by his disciple, John Rufus (John of Beth Rufina), later his successor as bishop of Maiuma.
* The so-called Syriac version of John Rufus&#x27; in Greek original, dates back to the 8th century
* The so-called Georgian version originally written by Peter&#x27;s contemporary, Zacharias Rhetor, bishop of Mytilene, in Greek has been preserved as a manuscript of c. 13th century.

<text>The Jackson Purchase, also known as the Purchase Region or simply the Purchase, is a region in the U.S. state of Kentucky bounded by the Mississippi River to the west, the Ohio River to the north, and the Tennessee River to the east.

Jackson&#x27;s Purchase also included all of Tennessee west of the Tennessee River. In modern usage, however, the term refers only to the Kentucky portion of the Jackson Purchase. The southern portion is simply called West Tennessee.

==History==
===Origin===
The land was ceded after prolonged negotiations with the Chickasaw Indians in which the United States was represented by Andrew Jackson and Isaac Shelby, while the Chickasaws were represented by their chiefs, head men, and warriors including: Levi Colbert, his brother George Colbert, Chinubby, and Tishomingo. On October 19, 1818, the two sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa. The United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw people $300,000, at the rate of $20,000 annually for 15 years, in return for the right to all Chickasaw land east of the Mississippi River and north of the new state of Mississippi border.

===After statehood===
Although claimed as part of Kentucky at its statehood in 1792, the land did not come under definitive U.S. control until 1818, when General Andrew Jackson and ex-Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby, representing the United States federal government, purchased it from the Chickasaw Indians through several treaties, including the Treaty of Tuscaloosa.

Historically, this region has been considered the most &quot;Southern&quot; of Kentucky; having an agricultural economy tied to cotton plantations and the use of enslaved labor before the Civil War, and being settled by people from Eastern and Central Kentucky, and backcountry areas of Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas; the Purchase in the years after the war voted as the most staunchly Democratic region in Kentucky, owing to heavily pro-Confederate sentiment in the region. For well over a century, it provided such overwhelming margins for Democratic candidates that Kentucky Democrats routinely called it the &quot;Gibraltar of Democracy&quot;. The most widely circulated newspaper and media outlet in the Purchase, &quot;The Paducah Sun&quot;, was once named the &quot;Paducah Sun-Democrat&quot; (see WPSD-TV). Due to changing demographics, most counties in the Purchase in the early 21st century have populations that are overwhelmingly white. Many African Americans left the area after the Civil War and in the Great Migration of the 20th century, many of them migrating to cities in the Midwest and West for industrial jobs.

During the Civil War, the Purchase was the area of strongest support for the Confederate cause within Kentucky. On May 29, 1861, a group of Southern sympathizers from Kentucky and Tennessee met at the Graves County Courthouse in Mayfield to discuss the possibility of aligning the Purchase with West Tennessee. Most records of the event were lost, possibly in an 1864 fire that destroyed the courthouse. After the War the region heightened its sense of being &quot;Southern&quot;.

In 1907, Fulton County judge Herbert Carr declared in a speech that the Mayfield Convention adopted a resolution for secession, and a historical marker in front of the courthouse also proclaims this as fact. But, the surviving records of the meeting, authored by a Union sympathizer, make no mention of this resolution. Historian Berry Craig states that the convention believed the whole of Kentucky would eventually secede and make unnecessary a separate resolution for the Purchase to break away.

Records do show that the convention adopted resolutions condemning President Abraham Lincoln for &quot;waging a bloody and cruel war&quot; against the South, urging Governor Beriah Magoffin to resist Union forces and praising him for refusing to answer Lincoln&#x27;s call for soldiers, and condemning the provision of &quot;Lincoln guns&quot; to Union sympathizers in Kentucky. The convention nominated Henry Burnett to represent Kentucky&#x27;s First District in Congress. The Mayfield Convention was a precursor to the later Russellville Convention, that formed the provisional Confederate government of Kentucky.

Since the late 20th century, the Purchase has voted for Republicans in national elections while giving higher percentages to candidates of the Democratic Party in state and local elections. This trend is similar to realignment among white conservatives in other parts of the South. , however, the region&#x27;s delegation in the Kentucky General Assembly included both Republican Party and Democratic Party representatives. For the first time in history, the region elected Republicans for both of its two state senators. The Jackson Purchase is within Kentucky&#x27;s 1st congressional district.

==Geography==
The Purchase comprised what is now eight counties, with a combined land area of 3,394.8 square miles (6,202.5 km2), about 6.03% of Kentucky&#x27;s land area. Its 2010 census population was 196,365 inhabitants, equal to 4.53% of the state&#x27;s population. Paducah, the largest city and main economic center, has just over 25,000 residents. The region&#x27;s other two largest cities, Murray and Mayfield, have about 18,000 and 10,000 residents respectively. The main educational institution is Murray State University.

===Counties===
* Ballard County
* Calloway County
* Carlisle County
* Fulton County
* Graves County
* Hickman County
* Marshall County
* McCracken County

===Largest municipalities===

==Economy==
Though chiefly an agricultural economy, tourism is an important industry in the Purchase, focused chiefly on water-related activities at the TVA-created Kentucky Lake. Together with the portion of the Tennessee River north of Kentucky Dam, it forms the eastern border of the Purchase.

===Notable people===
Notable people from the region include:

* Alben W. Barkley, Vice President of the United States, 1949–1953
* Julian Carroll, 54th Governor of Kentucky, 1974–1979
* Steven Curtis Chapman, Christian music artist
* Irvin Cobb, humorist and author

<text>was an engineer and statistician. From the 1950s on, Taguchi developed a methodology for applying statistics to improve the quality of manufactured goods. Taguchi methods have been controversial among some conventional Western statisticians, but others have accepted many of the concepts introduced by him as valid extensions to the body of knowledge.

==Biography==

Taguchi was born and raised in the textile town of Tokamachi, in Niigata prefecture. He initially studied textile engineering at Kiryu Technical College with the intention of entering the family kimono business. However, with the escalation of World War II in 1942, he was drafted into the Astronomical Department of the Navigation Institute of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

After the war, in 1948 he joined the Ministry of Public Health and Welfare, where he came under the influence of eminent statistician Matosaburo Masuyama, who kindled his interest in the design of experiments. He also worked at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics during this time, and supported experimental work on the production of penicillin at Morinaga Pharmaceuticals, a Morinaga Seika company.

In 1950, he joined the Electrical Communications Laboratory (ECL) of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation just as statistical quality control was beginning to become popular in Japan, under the influence of W. Edwards Deming and the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers. ECL was engaged in a rivalry with Bell Labs to develop cross bar and telephone switching systems, and Taguchi spent his twelve years there developing methods for enhancing quality and reliability. Even at this point, he was beginning to consult widely in Japanese industry, with Toyota being an early adopter of his ideas.

During the 1950s, he collaborated widely and in 1954-1955 was visiting professor at the Indian Statistical Institute, where he worked with C. R. Rao, Ronald Fisher and Walter A. Shewhart. While working at the SQC Unit of ISI, he was introduced to the orthogonal arrays invented by C. R. Rao - a topic which was to be instrumental in enabling him to develop the foundation blocks of what is now known as Taguchi methods.

On completing his doctorate at Kyushu University in 1962, he left ECL, though he maintained a consulting relationship. In the same year he visited Princeton University under the sponsorship of John Tukey, who arranged a spell at Bell Labs, his old ECL rivals. In 1964 he became professor of engineering at Aoyama Gakuin University, Tokyo. In 1966 he began a collaboration with Yuin Wu, who later emigrated to the U.S. and, in 1980, invited Taguchi to lecture. During his visit there, Taguchi himself financed a return to Bell Labs, where his initial teaching had made little enduring impact. This second visit began a collaboration with Madhav Phadke and a growing enthusiasm for his methodology in Bell Labs and elsewhere, including Ford Motor Company, Boeing, Xerox and ITT.

Since 1982, Genichi Taguchi has been an advisor to the Japanese Standards Institute and executive director of the American Supplier Institute, an international consulting organisation. His concepts pertaining to experimental design, the loss function, robust design, and the reduction of variation have influenced fields beyond product design and manufacturing, such as sales process engineering.

==Contributions==

Taguchi has made a very influential contribution to industrial statistics. Key elements of his quality philosophy include the following:
#Taguchi loss function, used to measure financial loss to society resulting from poor quality;
#The philosophy of &quot;off-line quality control&quot;, designing products and processes so that they are insensitive (&quot;robust&quot;) to parameters outside the design engineer&#x27;s control.
#Innovations in the statistical design of experiments, notably the use of an outer array for factors that are uncontrollable in real life, but are systematically varied in the experiment.
